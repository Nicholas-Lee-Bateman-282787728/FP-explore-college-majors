 The acting is superb, the story engaging, and the 'feel' of the movie is unequalled in  modern cinema. It makes you feel so much for Ed Wood Jnr. that you almost  wish that he had succeeded in making it big.

Excellently acted, written, directed, photographed, and  scored, Tim Burton's ED WOOD is certainly the auteur's best, personal works  next to VINCENT and EDWARD SCISSORHANDS:  all the stories of misunderstood  outsiders.

642611,3,6303407188,"Good movie, but it's chock-full of Hollywood style exaggeration and historical inaccuracies.

Here's just a few examples:

Bela didn't wrestle the octopus. Watch Bride of the Monster. It's clearly a stunt double .

Bela didn't live alone. After leaving rehab, Bela married a woman 30 years younger than him. Bela's son was a teenager during the filming of Plan 9.

Ed didn't meet Bela in a funeral home (while Bela was in a coffin). Bela didn't curse like a sailor and he had a rich social life.

The octopus was not stolen from the studio. Lisa Marie looks and sounds nothing like Maila Nurmi/Vampira - not even close. Horrible casting of Director's then girlfriend.

Ed never met Orson Welles in a bar while dressed in drag  - yeah - I get it - it's an ironic scene - ""best director/worst director"" -  (Orson did however romantically pursue Maila Nurmi/Vampira)

and some side notes:

Sarah Jessica Parker never bothered to contact Dolores Fuller before or during production of Ed Wood. SJP described Dolores as the ""worst actress in history"" during a talk show appearance.

Maila Nurmi was so burned by people in the entertainment business that she was terrified Disney would sell Ed Wood merchandise featuring the image of her Vampira character without paying her. She was living in poverty during the filming of Burton's Ed Wood.

If you want to know the real story of the people depicted in Ed Wood, may I suggest:

The casting couldn't have been better, in my opinion.  Depp was stellar in his portrayal of the cross-dressing Ed Wood, Jr.  Martin Landau was equally amazing in his role as former horror movie actor Bela Lugosi.  When you add Sarah Jessica Parker, Patricia Arquette, Jeff Jones, Bill Murray and other notable names and you have an amazingly talented ensemble cast.

642751,4,6303407188,"didn't know much about Ed Wood, except that everyone thought he made horrible films. I was intrigued when I saw that Tim Burton directed a biography of Ed Wood, and that Johnny Depp portrayed him. Why would Burton take on--what I assumed would be--a mockumentary? After watching the film, I should have known better. Burton would never be so crass as to bluntly make fun of someone. Whether it's ""the Burbs"" or ""Edward Scissor Hands"", Burton has a way of subtly poking fun at people. ""Ed Wood"" is no different. It is clear by Depp's portrayal, that Wood was a character worth insulting. However, the film has a respect for Wood that is evident in the sober tone of the film. This is not a straight comedy. The film merely delivers the events of Woods life in a Burton-esque fashion, and allows the audience to find the humor for themselves. (Much like the Josh Brolin ""W"".) I really enjoyed this approach, because it felt like the film was never passing judgement, which is refreshing considering Woods reputation. Beyond Wood, the movie also seems to be a semi-biography of Bela Lugosi, which is a great addition to the main storyline. Burton makes a clever style choice, by giving the film some aspects of Wood's films. For example, there are moments of bad acting (which are deliberate) and ridiculous characters. Overall, I enjoyed this movie. It successfully achieves its ambitious script, the performances are great, and the biography is fascinating (especially if you are a film lover).",1466640000,,1493,4.858823529411764
642752,5,6303407188,"If you are a fan of Mystery Science Theater 3000, then chances are you've seen a (heavily riffed) Ed Wood film and probably laughed until you cried.
Here, we have Tim Burton's loving tribute to and Johnny Depp's wacky, adorable performance as The Master of Bad Film Making, Edward D. Wood, Jr.  Yes, Wood's movies are terrible, but he is nothing if not 100% committed to writing, directing, producing, and even starring in his ""masterpieces.""  Nothing, not even a dead actor or an urgent desire to put on an angora sweater, could hold Ed Wood back from realizing a vision.  And that's what makes this movie, and Wood's legacy, so special.
The entire cast is fantastic, with particular standouts being Lisa Marie as Vampira, George ""The Animal"" Steele as the incomparable Tor Johnson, and of course Martin Landau, in his Oscar-winning performance as Bela Lugosi, the down-on-his-luck former horror-movie great.  Bill Murray and Sarah Jessica Parker also shine in their roles as (respectively) Wood's eccentric friend Bunny and Wood's very frustrated girlfriend/wannabe actress Delores.

Experience Tim Burtons acclaimed, true-life story of the wackiest filmmaker in Hollywood history, ED WOOD for the first time on Blu-ray and complete with an all-new digital restoration, featuring enhanced picture and sound. Celebrated actor Johnny Depp stars as the high-spirited director who never let terrible reviews or hostile studio executives derailed his big-screen dreams. With an oddball collection of showbiz misfits, Edward D. Wood Jr. takes the art of bad moviemaking to an all-time low!

Bill Murray, Sarah Jessica Parker and Academy Award winner Martin Landau [Best Supporting Actor, 1994, ED WOOD] are hilarious in this warm and witty comedy. Relive every madcap moment like never before on Blu-ray!

FILM FACT: Awards and Nominations: Academy Awards: Win: Best Supporting Actor for Martin Landau. Win: Best Make-up for Rick Baker (who designed Landau's prosthetic makeup), Ve Neill and Yolanda Toussieng. According to Bela G. (his son), Forrest Ackerman, Dolores Fuller and Richard Sheffield, the film's portrayal of Lugosi is inaccurate: In real life, he never used profanity, owned small dogs, or slept in coffins. And contrary to this film, Bela Lugosi did not struggle performing on The Red Skelton Show. The scenes of Bela Lugosi used for Plan 9 from Outer Space were not filmed outside Bela Lugosi own house, as the film depicts. They were, in fact, filmed outside Tor Johnson's house. Additionally, Bela Lugosi was not prone to fits of swearing, particularly in front of women and did not perform his own water stunt in Bride of the Monster. Bela Lugosi is also depicted as dying alone and miserable. Bela Lugosi's wife of twenty years, Lillian, did leave him in 1953, but he remarried in 1955 to Hope Lininger.

Andrews Blu-ray Review: The filmmaker Edward D. Wood Jr. [Johnny Depp] would like to make a Hollywood director that will go down in film history. Only there is one small problem: He is untalented and totally hopeless, but his passion for film is limitless. In primitive cardboard scenes and with a bizarre troupe he turns unswervingly horror and science fiction cheap productions, the encounter with critics and audiences with little understanding. With silent movie star and Dracula symbol Bela Lugosi [Martin Landau] Edward D. Wood Jr. wanted to turn his masterpiece, but seemingly insurmountable obstacles stand in his way. The film's black-and- white photography convincingly recaptures the look and feel of 1950s, including some of the least convincing special effects in film history. There are also running gags involving Edward D. Wood Jr. 's ability to write almost any piece of stock footage into almost any script.

At first glance one of the least likely people to have their life story filmed is Edward D. Wood Jr., the flamboyantly bad filmmaker sometimes called ""the world's worst."" But however awful his films  might seem initially, they do hold up to repeated viewings almost as surely as CITIZEN KANE [1941], but for completely different reasons and the sheer ineptness is fascinating, often reaching inspired peaks of lunacy. Wood's life was also quite unusual and at times deeply depressing as he scurried for decades around the fringe of Hollywood. So it was only a matter of time before Tim Burton added the director to his gallery of outsiders in a film simply entitled ED WOOD [1994].

The cast features a bunch of wonderful character actors, including Martin Landau, Sarah Jessica Parker, Patricia Arquette, Bill Murray, and Lisa Marie. Scott Alexander adapted the screenplay from Rudolph Greys book. The story tells the true-life story of Edward D. Wood Jr., famed as the worst director in the history of Hollywood, but at heart an enthusiastic movie fan with a passion to create. The film follows Edward D. Wood Jr. during his early career.

At the heart of the fil is Edward D. Wood Jr.'s friendship with Bela Lugosi, a man he truly adores, and who comes to depend on him. We see Bela Lugosi alone and lonely in a flimsy little tract house, inhabiting the deepening gloom of his obscurity and addiction, his first scene in the film shows him trying on a coffin for size, and Wood is able to lift the gloom, if only briefly, in a final series of roles which gave him double immortality: As the star of some of the best horror films ever made, and then of some of the worst.

Do not let the fact that this film is shot in Black-and-White turn you away from watching this masterpiece. It is truly one of the best Tim Burton films. Just like Edward D. Wood Jr., Tim Burton shot the film with what seems to be a low budget. One interesting bit of info is that the film was actually shot on Black-and-White to give the film its authentic reality. At the time, there were enough professional processing places that were able to handle Black-and-White. When a director wants to do a Black-and-White film now, it has to be shot in colour and then removed in post-production.

Johnny Depp is absolutely brilliant in this role; I actually like him better in this film than I do in the film Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. If you really want to see how wonderful a character actor Johnny Depp is at such a young age, then ED WOOD is the film to start appreciating this talented actor. Johnny Depp was able to hold his own with other fantastic character actors like Bill Murray and Martin Landau. Sarah Jessica Parker is the best she has been in this film, especially as I am not a huge fan of her at the best of times. Martin Landau is really wonderful in every role he plays, but he was meant to play Bela Lugosi and his performance is the best part of the entire film.

Howard Shore scored this film, is a total pleasure to listen to and gives the film great atmosphere. The sound quality of this Blu-ray disc is simply phenomenal, especially with the 5.1 soundtrack. The sound mix is completely front-cantered. Tim Burtons choice to use Black-and-White film was the best ideal choice ever; because Tim Burton wanted to make sure that the look, feel and even the sound of the film was not too modern. Howard Shores film score is hauntingly beautiful, and is presented throughout the film through the rear channel. Also totally brilliant is Tom Duffields tongue-in-cheek design and Stefan Czapskys luxurious black-and-white cinematography also enhances this film, which is very much in the tradition of Tim Burtons other films about outsiders.

ED WOOD ends right after the premiere of Plan 9 from Outer Space in 1959 without chronicling Edward D. Wood Jr. and his real-life descent into alcoholism and pornography. The film got favourable reviews from the likes of Roger Ebert, Jonathan Rosenbaum, Leonard Maltin and others. Still, sadly this wasn't enough to pull viewers into the cinemas, so ED WOOD became Tim Burton's first film that didn't make money even though it's considered one of his best and I totally agree 100%.

Finally, one nice extra bonus we get to read at the end of the film, is updated information about the real people that were portrayed in the film ED WOOD and they are as follows:

Edward D. Wood Jr. kept struggling in Hollywood, but mainstream success eluded him. After a slow decent into alcoholism and monster nudie films, Edward D. Wood Jr. passed away in 1978, at the age of 54. Two years later, Edward D. Wood Jr. was voted Worst Director Of All Time, bringing him worldwide acclaim and a new generation of fans.

Kathy Wood was married to Edward D. Wood Jr. for over 20 years, and loyal throughout many ups and downs. After Edward D. Wood Jr. death, Kathy Wood never remarried.

Bela Lugosi never rose from the grave, but after appearing in 103 films, Bela Lugosi is more famous than ever. Today, his film memorabilia outsells Boris Karloffs by substantial margin.

Bunny Breckinridge, despite much talk, never actually had his sex change. He is currently living in New Jersey.

Dolores Fuller, after leaving Edward D. Wood Jr., went on to a successful song writing career. Her compositions include the Elvis Presley hits Rock-A-Hula Baby and Do The Clam.

Tor Johnson, appeared in numerous B movies, before achieving his greatest fame as a best-selling Halloween mask. Tor Johnson passed away in 1971.

Vampira [Maila Nurmi] retired from show business to sell handcrafted jewelry. In the 1980s, Vampira unsuccessfully sued Elvira [Cassandra Peterson] for stealing her act.

Paul Marco and Conrad Brooks are still personalities on the Hollywood scene. Paul Marco is founder and president of the Paul Marco Fan Club. The New York Times recently named Conrad Brooks the Gielgud of Bad Movies.

Dr. Tom Mason, the chiropractor, appeared in one more Edward D. Wood Jr. film, Night Of The Ghouls. This time Edward D. Wood Jr. let him show his face.

Criswell [aka The Amazing Criswell] continued making highly inaccurate and bizarre predictions, often as a guest on The Tonight Show. Jeron Criswell Konig departed our dimension in 1982.

Blu-ray Video Quality  Touchstone Pictures brings you an excellent and stunning 1080p encoded crisp black-and-white picture images. Also most of the time you get really good sharpness and equally convincing detail drawing on a good and balanced contrast. Most of the scenes you view throughout the film have good depth effects. Overall throughout the film the impression is really brilliant and the choice of using Black-and-White film was the best choice ever for Tim Burton the director. Playback Region B/2: This will not play on most Blu-ray players sold in North America, Central America, South America, Japan, North Korea, South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Southeast Asia. Learn more about Blu-ray region specifications.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  Touchstone Pictures brings you a truly excellent 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio. Howard Shore scored this film, and it is a total exciting pleasure to listen to. The sound quality of this disc is simply phenomenal with the 5.1 soundtrack. The sound mix is completely front-centred. This goes back to Tim Burtons choice to use Black-and-White film; he wanted to make sure that the look, feel and even the sound of the film was not too modern. Howard Shores score is truly hauntingly beautiful, and is present throughout the film and also through the rear channels.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Audio Commentary: Commentary with Director Tim Burton, Actor Martin Landau, Co-Writers Larry Karaszewski and Scott Alexander, Director of Photography Stefan Czapsky and Costume Designer Colleen Atwood: Tim Burton's comments focus on ED WOOD, and how ""there's a real razor's edge between good and bad filmmaking."" Tim Burton discovered Edward D. Wood Jr. films on TV, and for him he has a distinct style, which lends a certain power to his films.  Ironically, writers Larry Karaszewski and Scott Alexander were tempted to write the screenplay after musing on how hard it was to make good films, and how most people aren't trying to make rubbish. They'd written the screenplay for Problem Child, which had then been taken off them and turned into a silly childrens film, instead of the adult comedy they wanted to make in the first place. That started them thinking about Edward D. Wood Jr. and the passion he had for making films.

Special Feature: Deleted Scenes [1994] [1080p] [1.85:1] [7:39] Here we have five separate deleted scenes to view, which includes Breaking In; Dinner at the Johnsons; Escape; Que Sera Sera and Sleep Over. Which consists of Two extend scenes with the theft of the giant octopus. We get a glimpse of Tor Johnson's home life. The strangest is a scene involving Bunny Breckenridge [Bill Murray] and the mariachi band seen briefly at the wrap party for Bride of the Monster. The best is an additional scene between Edward D. Wood Jr. and Bela Lugosi. You can either watch them separately or Play All.

Special Feature: Music Video Composed by Howard Shore [2009] [480i] [1.33:1] [3:27] This ED WOOD music video is Howard Shore's title theme, and Toni Basil's campy choreography fits right in. With this Black-and-White music video features some clips from the film interspersed with shots of Vampira [Lisa Marie] writhing around in a misty spooky cemetery. Directors: Tim Burton and Toni Basil. Composer: Howard Shore. Choreography: Toni Basil.

Special Feature: Let's Shoot This F#*%@r! [1994] [1080i] [1.33:1] [13:55] Johnny Depp provides an introduction and conclusion to this special promotional feature, where they were doing a wrap party in a Meat Packing Plant. Most of this special consists of neatly edited footage from the set with Johnny Depp in both Black-and-White and Colour. By far the best section chronicles the shooting of Bela Lugosi's ""octopus"" encounter. Most the material is simply fly-on-the-wall clips of the director Tim Burton at work, providing a brief but worthwhile peek into his process and obsessive attention to detail of this brilliant director.

Special Feature: The Theremin [1994] [1080i] [1.33:1] [7:24] Howard Shore discusses the use of this unique electronic instrument in the music film score, which is apparently a fusion of Cuban, old Sci-Fi, Henry Mancini and jazz. Theremin expert Mark Segal describes how the instrument works. The strange, ghostly vibe that pervades it comes from a 1920s electronic instrument known as the Theremin, which is an early electronic musical instrument controlled without physical contact by the person who plays the instrument. It is named after the Westernized name of its Russian inventor, Lon Theremin, who patented the device in 1928. We get to see the extraordinary instrument in action, which is played by hand movement in the space between two metal rods.

Special Feature: Making Bela [1994] [1080i] [1.33:1] [8:14] Actor Martin Landau contributes his rally nice thoughts in this really nice special, especially on the profile on Bela Lugosi [1882  1956], and also on his portrayal of the man. Make-up artist Rick Baker also talks through his work on how they transformed Martin Landau into Bela Lugosi, and why he would of have happily have done it for free. Martin Landau goes into great detail on his performance, and also talks fondly on the actor Bela Lugosi and we also get to see a very sad black-and-white photo of an emaciated Bela Lugosi when he entered a rehab centre for abuse of alcohol and drugs.

Special Feature: Pie Plates over Hollywood [1994] [1080i] [1.33:1] [13:49] Tom Duffield [Production Designer] discusses the challenges of the film's production design and also provides lots of information on the film's visuals. Tom Duffield also shares sketches from his rare production design book, that has loads of photos and Xerox images, which Tom Duffield always produces with each film he works on and also discusses how together Tom Duffield and Tim Burton designed  the look of the film. You also get to see clips from the film and you also get a combination of Black-and-White and Colour images throughout this special feature. This was quite a nice little feature.

Theatrical Trailer [1994] [480i] [1.33:1] [2:19] This is the Original Theatrical Trailer for the film ED WOOD. Despite being brief, it is still very clever. It is also a fantastic presentation and this trailer certainly gives you a flavour of what to expect when you see this brilliant film.

Finally, 'ED WOOD' isn't your typical biopic. It is more of homage to the era and style of the filmmaker than a straight recitation of the facts. However, it works perfectly in this case. 'ED WOOD' is a loving celebration of outcasts, misfits, passion, and filmmaking. Tim Burton brings a heartfelt spirit of quirky nostalgia to the picture that somehow finds laughter and tears in one of the most unlikely biopics ever made. The video transfer is strong and while the audio is very front-heavy, it serves the film well. The commentary and featurettes offer some great insights into the production and real-life inspirations for the story. This is one of my many favourite films from Tim Burton, and thankfully Touchstone Pictures has done the film justice. This is easily his best picture, and perhaps his most personal one and Edward D. Wood Jr.s friendship with Bela Lugosi reflects Tim Burtons own relationship with veteran horror actor Vincent Price. There is no picture which captures better the importance of art, friendship, resilience, optimism, and respect for others and for history. Try and purchase it to see why I love this film. 'ED WOOD' is a triumph, and the Blu-ray is well worth the price. Very Highly Recommended!

642845,4,6303407188,"How can one make a film about the worst ever director in Hollywood? Not a loser really since he managed to do a few things in B movies though from what we see we could think his films are a lot more advanced in the alphabet. But certainly not the winner he wanted to be or become and he never became for sure. That will lead him into alcoholism to forget or go on dreaming, just like Bela Lugosi got into drug addiction to be able to sleep at night.

The film has some qualities but they are ruined most of the time by the fact the whole thing is too long. The few interesting things are the fact that the film is in black and white. Just like great films of an older period and of Orson Welles actually impersonated in the film. Thats a good idea and it is rather well done including night scenes which were necessarily a problem.

The way the whole film industry is based on words that mean nothing is really nastily true and even the one who wanted to go to Mexico to become a lady did not. What you say never means anything and the director is nothing but a nice little small barking dog on the short leash of the producers and the producers provide the money, the little amount of money. So you do what they say. If there is a profit they will get it, not you, young dummy.

Those films are so mediocre when they are not bad that I wonder how they can find an audience and make a profit. The point is that they do both. So they must satisfy the deeper desires and impulses of that audience, and many of these people are not children, especially since many of these B movies are slightly restricted at least to younger children. I recently covered a very good film by Tim Burton, The Nightmare before Christmas, and someone told me that it is funny to have Christmas attacked by Halloween and that Halloween is all fun and joy for children, young people and even older people though these do not go around knocking on doors.

I sure believe some Halloween fun is good now and then, provided you are in a reasonable team because it might be cruel if not criminal to frighten an old person with a pacemaker. But Tim Burton is obviously fascinated by death, here Bela Lugosi who dies on location and is buried who knows and cares where; by marginal people who are breaking all kinds of norms and taboos like transvestites in the 1960s or so. And anyway you have to be morbid, and even a morbid masochist, to be a B movie director since you know it is mediocre and not good at all and that you won't make a name with them and you won't get much money out of them. It is true today you can make more with DVDs and the Internet, provided you are not looted, pirated, hijacked, in other words raided freely since the freedom of the Internet is considered to be cost-free by some.

This film though is sad because Tim Burton could do better. Yet it brought Johnny Depp out and enabled him to make a name and a career, or rather it enabled him to survive for a while and to show his art, and his art is great. The art of the others is more moderate. I guess Johnny Depp must be nostalgic about the good old days when he was able to play foolish tricks to everyone on screen.

642962,4,6303407188,"The 1950's and 1960's were the Golden Age of sleaze and schlock film, particularly for the drive-in movie-goers who had better things to do than actually watch the movie! And the King of All-Schlock has to be Ed Wood, voted Hollywood's Worst Filmmaker. If you're going to be bad, you might as well be the worst. No one remembers the fifth worst! Wood employed some of the strangest talent for even stranger projects, and the genius of Wood was not the production value but getting the funding! I mean, who in their right mind would fund ""Grave Robbers from Space"" after having read the script? Conservative Baptists? His one name star, Bela Lugosi, is remembered for being in some of best horror films at the dawn of the talkie age and some of the worst care of Wood.

One thing to keep in mind: Ed Wood was not alone. Aside from some of Wood's more wretched offerings, such as ""Glen or Glenda"", regarded by some critics as far more unwatchable than ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"", Hollywood was ripe with many memorable celluloid fiascoes. ""Robot Monster"", ""Santa Claus Conquers the Martians"", and (my favorite) ""The Incredibly Strange Creatures Who Stopped Living and Became Mixed-Up Zombies"" are all cult classics of bad movie-making remembered for their combination of strangeness, silliness, and unwatchable-ness. None of these were produced by Wood and yet were made during the same era.

The entire era from circa 1950 to 1970 had such nutty movies that if someone wrote a novel about it, no one would believe it! At the top of the heap is the oh-so-memorable ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"", so ridiculously bad that it invites after-movie conversation much more than many movies being produced today. The bad sets, the bad dialog, the bad acting are still discussed today. No one discusses films which are merely mediocre. With ""Plan 9"", schlock was elevated into its own category, probably the inspiration behind the ""Razzie Award"". ""Plan 9"" is the film by which all other schlock films are judged.

""Ed Wood"" with Johnny Depp in the title role chronicles the brief career of the one producer of movies who stands on a pedestal above the rest in the museum of cheesy film production where talent didn't quite get their footprints into the Chinese Theatre. If Barney Fife (the frantic deputy from the Andy Griffith Show) wrote and directed movies, the results might be of the Ed Wood variety. Wood's writing was filled with clich, incomprehensible story lines, bad characterizations, and even worse stage direction. And yet, among his more memorable ""works"" (if works they can be called), the dialog is what we remember most. I mean who else but Wood could come up with: "" I'll bet my badge that we haven't seen the last of those weirdies."" or ""They've been like that all down through the ages. Especially in a spot like this."" Pure Razzie genius.

Tim Burton's homage to the era of schlock works on every level. Ironically, A-list acting talent plays some of the most borderline ""talent"" of the era who ended up in Woods' projects basically because they didn't fit in anywhere else. The Amazing Criswell a.k.a. Criswell Predicts (played by Jeffrey Jones) was amazing because he was the one act who could appear on the Johnny Carson Show without having any talent. Vampira, who in real life later sued Elvira, had just been fired from her local television studio. Sarah Jessica Parker (of Sex in the City fame) plays Wood's girlfriend. Johnny Depp, now just about as A-list as they come, plays Wood, and highest honors go to Martin Landau as the aging Bela Lugosi in a tour-de-force performance. Lugosi never could distance himself from Dracula, and Wood was the only filmmaker in town who still appreciated the Hungarian accent and his tuxedo.

Shot in B&W, ""Ed Wood"" almost feels like a slightly better Ed Wood movie. The film concentrates on three of his most remembered projects, ""Glen or Glenda"", ""Bride of the Monster"" (formerly ""Bride of the Atom""), and his masterpiece ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"". There are a few moments of clich writing which almost seem purposeful, paying homage to the man who wrote the book on clich. Of course, the irony is that Ed Wood is now remembered as the pioneer of schlock movie. A few production companies do carry on the tradition, such as Troma Entertainment whose offerings have a look and feel in the Ed Wood tradition: over-the-top acting, clich riddled scripts, and low-budget sets, such as ""Surf Nazis Must Die"" and ""the Toxic Avenger"". Many of the offerings of Roger Corman are also in a similar vain. Ed Wood may or may not have been the absolute worst, but he is remembered for living and breathing film, believing his catastrophes were art.",1433808000,,4687,4.810173697270471

That probably won't happen, since the movie bombed (made something like $6 million in the U.S.). They went nuts for this movie in France, though. A disc set to that region would probably sell like Amelie did over here.

I do wonder, however, why they chose not to give Johnny Depp Wood's trademark mustache (he's otherwise as convincing as he is in all Tim Burton films). But far better that they cast Martin Landeau perfectly as Bella Lugosi in his final years. The same goes to Sarah Jessica Parker and Bill Murray in their respective roles. And the rest of the cast, really.

ED WOOD: Depp's lovable, loopy Wood is more used car salesman than artist; all ambition and enthusiasm, but devoid of even an atom of talent. He's a tireless and effective cheerleader, though, and when we see him watch every take with wide-eyed wonder, we understand that what drives him drives every artist --as Wood himself realizes when he meets Orson Welles and discovers that they share similar problems as ""filmmakers.""
The center of gravity of the film, however, is the genuinely affectionate friendship that develops between Wood and Lugosi--the latter washed-up, desiccated, addicted to morphine, yet still attempting to retain some dignity. ""Ed Wood"" succeeds both as ""biopic"" parody and as a fond, ultimately touching tribute from a visionary filmmaker to a pair of casualties of their own vision.",1421884800,,1067,4.960893854748603

Johnny Depp certainly is memorable in the role but Martin Landau is equally memorable and astonishing as Bela Lugosi with precise make up work by Rick Baker. Some of the film isn't entirely based on fact, such as the brilliant scene which Wood meets Orson Welles, but it doesn't really need to be as far as I'm concerned. A lot of the mind of Ed Wood is brought to life in the set designs and the amazing opening title sequence. The film itself works as much of a bizarre fantasy as the cult director, which only Burton could truly pull off.

we may not want to admit it, but there's something potentially inspirational about Ed Wood. what the man lacked in talent he compensated for with determination. he faced drawbacks and frustrations that would reduce many of us to rubble on what comes off as a daily basis, but he refused to be sidetracked. say if you will that Ed Wood COULDN'T make movies, but you'll never say that Ed Wood DIDN'T make movies.
the demonstration of which remains both Tim Burton's and Johnny Depp's finest work. granted, Martin Landau got the lion's share of the kudos with his mesmerizing turn as Bela Lugosi, but he couldn't of done it if everyone else hadn't been on their game as well. it's one thing to steal the show, but it takes equally dedicated colleagues to make it worth stealing.
the principle thrust of the plot of course is Wood's relationship with Lugosi, centering on the three films they did together. these are of course textbook lost souls. on top of his stubborn pursuit of cinema stardom, Wood has his crossdressing fetish, which is a particular no-no in the button-down '50s. the combination of the two finally costs him his relationship with actress Dolores Fuller. Bela is obviously a has-been (a running-gag has just about everyone Wood encounters assuming he was dead), but that's the least of his worries. his wife recently left him, he's become addicted to morphine, and the government cancels his welfare. in short, he particularly needed a friend when Ed found him.
you'd expect a film centering on such strife to be a downer, but in fact the film ha an incongruously sunny disposition, a' la Frank Capra. this most likely works because it's subject was himself so willfully resistant to Cold Hard Reality. the film and it's subject wear the same prescription rose-colored glasses.
just how much of this film should we take with the proverbial grain of salt? this is a complication common to biography films, because 90% of the time they have to speculate. it's not as if the screenwriters were privy to the discussions and decisions they have to communicate to an audience. all they really can do is offer the general ""gist"" of what happened. well, it is admitted in the commentary that the late meeting with Orson Welles is ""complete baloney from start to finish,"" but apart from that this is an accurate gist. writing a biography or shooting a biopic is basically painting a portrait.
personally, i've come to the conclusion that Ed Wood did indeed have a certain modicum of cinematic ""gifts""...he just wasn't suited to hold the reins. i mean, Glen Or Glenda? has a rather impassioned as well as valid plea for brotherly love and understanding buried somewhere in all that mess. also, no one's denying that Plan 9 From Outer Space was pitifully executed, but structurally speaking, it's plot is no worse that that of a thousand other films along the same lines. (there's even one quite profound observation therein, where the alien soldier remarks how odd it is that the living, who can think, should be so frightened of the dead, who cannot.) and quite frankly, even in it's ultimate fiasco form Plan 9 beats the hell out of the giant-radioactive-bug thing that was in vogue at the time.
so maybe all Ed needed to do to ensconce himself into the higher echelons of the ""business"" (and a less impoverished way of life) was to concentrate solely on writing. but of course it's that very incompetence that got him his cult status. if Ed Wood had had the sense to acknowledge his limits, he'd probably of been completely forgotten by now.

643239,5,6303407188,"There must have been something very appealing to Tim Burton about the career of film-maker Ed Wood.  Making a film about the supposedly worst film director certainly would allow considerable artistic license, for which Burton excels. However, when a film-maker makes a film about a film-maker, it would seem that the product would also be an essay on the creative process for this particular medium. In this regard , as well as the entertainment value, the film is a great success.

The idea that Ed Wood was the worst film maker in Hollywood is probably unfair, and in fact in this film, he is shown as highly productive stretching every resource and producing vast amounts of work in a short period of time.  A fair judgment of Woods work would have to assess what was produced for what costs. In this regard he may be better evaluated than most.

Another aspect of the film is the exploration of the ego of the artist. Was Wood and egotist?  Of course he was as was every artist who strives and produces. Without a clear vision the artist is adrift. Wood had to make considerable compromises due to lack of funds and living in a network of social influence and human frailty, but it is still possible to retain the artistic vision within these confines, in fact that is one criteria for the judgment of the artist; how true were they to developing and implementing a unique vision given the constraints of the time and resource in which they worked.  If this review sounds a bit academic and relates to art criticism, so what? It is as fair to judge this film based upon what it says about the artistic process as it is to judge the film based upon its entertainment value. In my opinion, both are very high in this film.

Switching to a review of the entertainment value, it must be said that the performances of the main characters were superb, the art direction and attention to detail, and the soundtrack by Howard Shore were all excellent. Johnny Depp has the ability to show on his face the ambiguities going on in his mind as he as to compromise, repeatedly, his artistic vision and the constraints placed upon him. Were Woods ideas of mixing transgenders, aliens, cowboys, and monsters really so farfetched?  I think not, after all when Picasso painted African masks on French prostitutes cubism was born. However, the most amazing dramatic performance in the film, as is universally acknowledged, is that of Marin Landau playing legendary Dracula actor Bela Lugosi.

643348,5,6303407188,"Ed Wood is a fascinating figure -- he made several low-budget movies that have become cult classics, despite having no talent or understanding of how to make a movie. He just loved film.

And director Tim Burton clearly has a lot of respect for that love. ""Ed Wood"" follows the director during the, um, best part of his career, as well as his friendship with the fallen horror actor Bela Lugosi. This is one of the best films that Burton has ever made -- a slightly cartoonish tale about an optimistic, energetic man who wouldn't let anything stand in his way.

When playwright Ed Wood Jr. (Johnny Depp) hears about a schlocky sex-change movie, he convinces a producer to let him direct the movie... because he's a transvestite. No, I don't quite  understand the logic. Then he strikes up a friendship Bela Lugosi (Martin Landau),  whose drug addictions have destroyed his career. But Wood blithely casts his idol in the movie, determined to give him the recognition he deserves.

After ""Glen and Glenda"" bombs, Wood starts searching for independent funding for his next movie, ""Bride of the Atom"" -- only to encounter a lot of personal and financial disasters, including being dumped by his girlfriend and Lugosi's suicidal depression.

The next movie -- initially called ""Grave Robbers From Outer Space"" -- seems to be going well at first, especially since Ed has found love with Kathy (Rosanna Arquette). But then things begin to spiral off into disaster when Ed must contend with a tragic death and recalcitrant Baptists who don't understand Wood's vision. Will this movie finally crush Ed Wood's spirit?

""Ed Wood"" is a strangely touching movie, especially since it focuses on the early part of Wood's career, before he spiraled into alcoholism and weird porn. This Wood is an enthusiastic optimist who believes deeply in his artistic goals. And his unlikely friendship with Lugosi forms the heart and soul of the movie -- Wood's innocent admiration of the fallen star gives him some lease on life.

This is Burton before he lapsed into self-parody territory -- while there's an oddly cartoonish quality to some scenes (the octopus falling on Tor), it's the most realistic movie he has ever done. The black-and-white filming and slightly over-the-top acting give it a weird quality at times, but the more somber parts are hauntingly sad and realistic, such as when Wood finds a suicidal, depressed Lugosi.

This adds a poignant undercurrent to what is otherwise a rather funny movie. There are a lot of hilarious moments (""You must be double-jointed. And you must be Hungarian""), particularly when we see Wood's ""big picture"" method of filmmaking.

Johnny Depp gives one of his all-time best performances here as Wood -- he's a bright-eyed, eternally optimistic creature who adores film and wants to make glorious schlock himself. There's just something very endearing about his innocent depiction of Wood, and it makes you root for him even though his movies are notoriously bad. You really want him to succeed.

But Depp is frequently eclipsed by Martin Landau, who gives a truly heartbreaking performance as Bela Lugosi -- he captures all the sorrow of a talented man who has been chewed up and spit out of the Hollywood system, because of a drug addiction that no one except Wood will help him with. When people start recognizing him in the street and asking for his autograph -- all because of Wood -- it warms your heart.

""Ed Wood"" is a delightfully funny movie with a tragic undercurrent -- and the brilliant performances by Depp and Landau make it a truly beautiful experience. This is Burton's best.",1365724800,,3614,4.916256157635468

643354,5,6303407188,"This is one of those movies I've been meaning to see for years, but never got around to it. Well I finally did and happy because of it. I cannot describe how much I loved this movie. The acting, the story, the cinematography, the music, the sets, the characters, I loved everything about it. The performance from Johnny Depp is phenomenal and confident, but it doesn't stop there. All of the side characters are brilliantly portrayed, my favorite being Bill Murray. And of course Martin Landau's Oscar nominated portrayal of Bela Lugosi is equally heartbreaking and inspiring, proof that sometimes the Academy knows what they're doing. All of the classic Burton elements are here, but in a very subtle fashion that doesn't get in the way of the story. They're so subtle that I had to keep reminding myself throughout the film that it was directed by Tim Burton. It may not be his most original film in the visual sense, but it really is his best film in terms of just overall impact. It is the story of a man who just wants to be himself no matter what others say. Although Ed Wood may have the been the worst filmmaker of all time, he sure was an original who loved his work and loved his life. It will leave you inspired and smiling. If you're on the fence about this one because you're not a fan of Burton/Depp collaborations, believe me I get why you wouldn't be, throw those doubts away and just give this underrated gem a chance.

643419,5,6303407188,"Dieser Film ist alles andere als ""paradox"". Edward D Wood junior (das D steht fr Davies), der sich nie um ausgefeilte Drehbcher scherte, den es schlichtweg egal war, welche Darsteller bei ihm mitwirkten. Der sich teilweise einfach Szenen aus ganz anderen Filmen bediente, versuchte, diese irgendwie bei seinen ""Meistwerken"" einzubauen. Der kreativ war, - uerst trickreich (einfach aus der Not heraus, so gut wie niemals auch nur ein halbwegs angemessenes Budget zur Verfgung zu haben).

Der seine Filme vor allem als Geschenk an das Publikum verstanden wissen wollte.

Ein garnicht mal unbegabter Kopf, mit absoluter Fantasie und sogar tollen Ideen bedacht. Jemand, der Herz (wie bei Bela Lugosi) hatte. Fr den ein Begriff wie Freundschaft, nicht nur wie bei leider vielen, irgendeine leere Floskel wahr.

Ein absolut normaler Mensch, trotz allem, wofr ein stand und eintrat, anderen Leuten dennoch immer zugnglich war, - nicht im geringsten von sich selbst eingenommen.

Aber auch mal genauso schwach, verletzlich, introviertiert, den Alkohol und Drogen nicht abgeneigt, in seiner Jugend ein Frauenheld, - und besa einen ausgeprgten Fetisch fr Frauenkleider (mit denen er ja oft am Set pltzlich auftauchte), war aber nicht direkt homosexuell.

Kam selber aus ganz einfachen Verhltnissen, diente aber trotzdem tapfer im 2. Weltkrieg, wo sich wschl. sein merkwrdiger Faible fr sexy Damenmode schon sehr frh zeigte. Er gab es dann spter auch ohne Scheu zu, - unter seiner Uniform sowas oft getragen zu haben.

Und der trotzdem richtig gutes Durchsetzungsvermgen als auch eine sehr groe berzeugungskraft gleichermaen besa. Dies ist sein filmisches Portrait.

Dargestellt von Johnny Depp, ebenfalls ein Ausnahmetalent und sich nicht zu schade, Rollen zu verkrpern, mit denen sich ein jeder identifizieren kann.

Unter der Leitung von Tim Burton, Regisseur, von dem schon oft etwas verfilmt wurde, bei dem andere sogenannte Hollywoodgren (Darsteller wie Produzenten) garnicht diesen Mut zu Risiko, einen Flop zu landen, bereit wren, einzugehen.

Ich mag diesen Streifen sehr, konnte auch herzhaft ber die echte Filme wie z. B. den berchtigten ""Plan 9 from outher Space"" von Ed Wood nur schn schmunzeln.

Mchte hier auch garnicht leugnen, das man fast schon mitleidig ber ihn lachen konnte, ganz besonders in diesem Film. Warum ist klar, eben das wird es halt sein, was Ed Wood (Johnny Depp) hier durchaus so 100 % sympathisch macht. Ein klassischer Fall.

Genau so bleibt der echte Ed Wood in Erinnerung. Einfach der typische Underdog.

Ein doch naiver Idealist, - der sich halt auch von niemandem hier sagen lsst, er wre ja nur unbegabt.

Der an sich trotz Widerstnden glaubt, - der von seinen Ideen berzeugt ist.

Sehr selten, - dh. wenn berhaupt, dann vielleicht nur zu vergleichen mit Andy Kaufman, finden wir (die Zuschauer) solche oft (zu ihren Lebzeiten) einfach zu Unrecht verstandenen, echten Visionre. Ihrer Zeit meitens schon weit vorraus.

Und, bedauerlicherweise, wurden sie z. T. auch noch bis heute nicht richtig fr ihre Leistungen zumindest fair annerkannt.

Tja, es ist ... und war eben schon immer leichter, einfach nur mit dem Strom zu treiben als dagegen zu schwimmen. Aber, so ist es halt, sei es drum, diese spte Verbeugung, solch eine letzte Ehrung, - eine Hommage wie hier sei ihnen gegnnt.

Der verdiente Oscar dafr hat es letztendlich dann doch gezeigt. Schade eben nur, das sowas viel zu spt meitens erst vorkommt, wenn diejenigen nichts mehr davon haben.

Auch die anderen Mitwirkenden, wie Lisa Marie, die Vampira darstellt oder George ""the Animal"" Steele, der Thor Johnson verkrpert, ebenso wie Patricia Arquette, die Ed Wood's Frau, Kathleen O'Hara (war mit ihm verheiratet von 1959 - 1978) spielt, oder Sarah Jessica Parker als Dolores Fuller, seine erste Freundin, die ihn dann aber wegen seiner transvestitischen Neigungen fr weibliche Angora - Unterwsche sitzen lie, - sie alle fhlen sich wunderbar berzeugend in ihre Figuren ein.

Martin Landau, der Bela Lugosi hier darstellt, natrlich ganz besonders. Vor allem ist es aber Johnny Depp, bei dem man wie vorher mit Jim Carry als Andy Kaufman in ""der Mondmann"" oder auch Woody Harrelson, der Larry Flynt spielte, immer das Gefhl bekommt, sie ""SIND"" einfach im Film derjenige persnlich !

Und nicht das es nur gespielt wurde, - ps. wobei der echte Larry Flynt ja noch lebt, die anderen beiden hier genannten lassen sich eben nicht mehr fragen, ob sie denn mit ihrer jeweiligen Verkrperung selbst zufrieden gewesen wren.

Das bleibt also genau ihnen, dem Zuschauer hier berlassen. Und allein schon deswegen - Fazit - kann ich auch nur die Empfehlung, zumindest als Ausleihtip dafr geben ... ;-)",1353715200,2,4672,5.269541778975741

643488,5,6303407188,"Original, sweet-tempered and enjoyable film which is one of my favorites among Burton's oeuvre. Ignored in life, mocked in death, Edward D. Wood Jr. was a real phenomenon in American cinema history, especially famous for his Z-budget filmmaking. Making a biopic about such a schlocky visionary reputed as the worst director of all-time is just a groovy idea, which only Tim Burton or Coen Brothers dare to do it.

Shot beautifully in moody black & white, the film centers on Wood's most ""prolific"" period, when he relentlessly churned out one movie after the next, from his 1953 beyond-awful debut ""Glen or Glenda"" to his ""groundbreaking"" 1959 sci/fi ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"". Paying a final tribute to this idiosyncratic director, Burton opts to portray Wood and his misfit menagerie in an overexaggeratedly sympathetic way, not to depict the darker side of his life. The film ends before his slide into porn, misery and alcoholism. The film charts Wood's tragi-comic career: his flagrant ineptitude as a writer, producer and director; his efforts to beat the bushes for cash; his indifferent, hyper-enthusiastic and over-optimistic disposition against all kinds of professional and personal setbacks; his sheer passion and child-like naivet; his transvestite tendencies with a particular taste in fluffy Angora sweaters, blond wigs and high heels; and lastly his strange friendship with 70-year old sepulchral Hungarian actor Bela Lugosi.

The film is hilarious and witty from beginning to end, especially the recreation of certain scenes from Wood's original work (e.g. Lugosi's fight with a flaccid rubber octopus puppet and graveyard scene of ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"") are hysterically funny. But such a film desperately needs a some degree of gravity. The relationship and chemistry between Wood and Lugosi is the emotional core of the film. Johnny Depp gives a sympathetic and charismatic portrayal of Wood. But, this is Martin Landau who really steals the show, and he is the glue that holds the movie together. His performance is dazzling, conveying the ego, pathos, pride and real dignity of the former horror hero Bela Lugosi. This is the role which won him Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor and he really deserved it.

To me, ""Ed Wood"" shows that life is not merely about success, fame or money; but rather about your creative spirit, and how much you cling to your principles and how much you love what you do. Burton portrays Wood as a winner, because he dared to make films yet he had absolutely no gift when it comes to filmmaking. Today, despite the fact that his films are used as a benchmark that the most awful films are measured by, that's not the problem at all.

The wonderful irony of the film is that it won two Oscars with the name ""Ed Wood"" written on it :))",1324598400,,2793,4.974304068522484

I like Depp and Bill Murray but their roles here are bizarre, and in Murrays case they don't really let his comedic talents shine. He could have added some needed humor to the story, instead they accentuate his bizarreness without mining Murray's comedic talents.

All in all a very disappointing film that I could not watch to the very end, and even after reading all these glowing reviews the only way I see this movie again is if I'm in a film class and they dissect it for teaching purposes - not for entertainment.",1315440000,5,596,4.570093457943925
643490,5,6303407188,"Johnny Depp stars as Ed Wood, arguably the worst movie director of all time, in this amusing and at times, touching story of Ed's career in the fifties.  Ed was an unparalleled optimist, enamored with movie-making; he possessed little talent, expertise, or money, but he and his little group of pals made cheap and very bad horror/sci-fi movies and loved it.  The only star he ever worked with was Bela Lugosi (Martin Landau), decades after his success as 'Dracula,' now drug-addicted and in failing health.  Wood and Lugosi made several films together, the most (in)famous being, ""Plan 9 From Outer Space,"" which was actually made after Lugosi's death.

Depp is extremely likable and sympathetic as the effervescent Wood.  His quirky, driven personality and penchant for wearing angora sweaters seem entirely believable.  Landau won a Best Supporting Oscar for his portrayal of the washed-up Lugosi; he's pathetic and grotesque and absolutely mesmerizing.  Watching Ed throw together a whole movie in a few days is hilarious.  For Ed, quality was in the mind of the beholder and he loved his movies.

643517,5,6303407188,"""Ed Wood"" is about Ed Wood, a film director who was very good at making bad movies. The film is directed by Tim Burton and Johnny Depp plays the title character and the movie is a biopic about a real person. After seeing this movie when I was a kid I was inspired to make home-made movies with a camcorder. It is not fair that everyone who makes it into show business has to be talented so occasionally their has to be an Ed Wood to break the ice. Ed Wood wasn't a mere mediocrity. He was a disaster.

In the movie Ed Wood is an aspiring film maker living during either the 1940s or 1950s, and he's got the spirit but not the talent. He makes a go at showbusiness thinking he'll be the next Orson Welles and boy is he wrong. He can win people over in an interview but when it comes to making movies, his movies aren't just bad, they're incompetent.

Johnny Depp's performance in this movie is awesome. He's really funny in the movie and acting in strange films seems to be his talent. Martin Landau is great as Bela Lugosi. He reveals what exactly was so funny about Bela Lugosi's performance in Glen and Glenda. Martin Landau won an academy award for his performance and rightly so. Bill Murray is also hilarious.

After seeing this movie I then saw several of Ed Wood's movies and watched a documentary on him called ""Ed Wood: Look Back in Angora"", so this is a movie that convinced me to watch other movies. The movie Ed Wood is better than any movie that Ed Wood made, and not only that, it is a magnificent movie.",1301961600,,1518,4.2822299651567945
643518,5,6303407188,"Despite his best efforts, Ed Wood's name has become synonymous with terrible filmmaking, but now, Tim Burton gives the quirky and ambitious director his moment in the spotlight! ED WOOD is both sad and uplifting, and shows the best and worst sides that Hollywood and stardom have to offer. The comedic tale follows poor Ed as he struggles endlessly to live out his dreams of directing movies that are filled with action and imagination. His biggest failings lead him to chance encounters with genre legends Bela Lugosi and Orson Welles, who continue to inspire him even when all hope seems lost. On top of everything else, his love for angora sweaters and cross-dressing continue to set him back both professionally and personally. If enthusiasm had only equaled talent, Ed Wood may have become the world's greatest director, and Tim Burton is sure to show it throughout this heartwarming tragedy.

Johnny Depp stars as Ed Wood in a stylized but highly entertaining exaggeration of the character. He delivers many subtle nuances to the role that make him pitifully naive and endearing at the same time. Depp is joined by a talented cast, including Sarah Jessica Parker and Patricia Arquette as his two love interests, Jeffrey Jones and Bill Murray as his kooky cohorts, and Martin Landau in an Academy Award-winning performance as the tattered old Bela Lugosi, with whom Wood would share a close friendship throughout his final years. Landau is fully deserving of all critical praise, as he is impeccable in the role and completely indistinguishable from the real-life Lugosi. Wood and Lugosi have many common bonds that draw them together, particularly in that they have strong motivations and inspiration, but that they are each critically flawed in numerous ways.

The characters are drawn together in a colorful story as Wood brainlessly cons investors into supporting his artless productions. Their adventures lead them into unbelievably funny situations where they are run out of studios and left out to film in the dark without sound or working props. Burton capitalizes on the most outrageous moments of Wood's career, but equally balances the silly humor with dramatic lulls to link the film with reality. The uncanny reproductions from films like GLEN OR GLENDA, BRIDE OF THE MONSTER, and (of course) PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE are pulled off flawlessly, as are the casting decisions for side characters like Vampira and Tor Johnson.

ED WOOD is essential viewing for all movie fans whether they are familiar with the character or not. It encapsulates the entrepreneurial spirit of the independent filmmaker and the inherent difficulties in following the golden road to Hollywood with more than a hint of satire. One cannot help but be drawn back to Wood's terrible films after watching this loving tribute!

643519,4,6303407188,"Wood's Legacy, Sort Of.

I saw the mid-90s biopic, Ed Wood and have always wanted to watch it!  Wood's films are at once amateurish if not just downright bad.  Yet if you were going to watch one, prepare for some charm and some silliness along the way -- bad dialogue, falling down cardboard tombstones, etc.

I really wish though that the director Tim Burton was less fast & loose on his facts.  Loretta King was not allergic to water.  Wood's wife was not self-absorbed and cranky.  Bela Lugosi's son has stated that his father was not using vulgarities, especially in front of women (per a Wiki article someplace -- take or leave!), and Ed Wood never actually met Orson Welles!

However, Burton has said that the book he was basing the film on was not totally accurate as well.  I think this does not justify being sloppy.  Still, Johnny Depp adds depth to his portrayal of the maligned director, his tendency to dress up in women's clothes and his close friendship with Bela Lugosi, whose last performance was in a Wood film.

Despite the silliness of the film and its doubtful accuracy, I liked several things about it.  The portrayal by Martin Landau as Bela Lugosi was great.  I've seen many of Lugosi's films and Martin really had the accent down and where they played Lugosi to be small and weak during his drug rehab, the disturbing scenes where Lugosi is shooting up and the foul-mouthed yet lovable washed up actor doing his thing, Martin had down so well as to win a Best Supporting Actor Oscar!

The actual production of the production of Plan 9 from Outer Space was great.  The actors who portrayed the Vampira and Tor Johnson were spot on.  Bill Murray was his usual foppish self as he portrayed a gay man who wanted, but never got, a sex change but played the supreme mind of the galaxy just fine, thank you.  Sarah Jessica Parker plays the forgettable girlfriend of Wood.

DVD:

The best part of the DVD for me was the Making of Lugosi, with an interview with Martin Landau and how he prepared and got into character.  Rick Baker also was interviewed and gushed how he always wanted to do make-up on a movie like this and actually would have done it for free.  He won an Oscar too.  The deleted scenes could stay deleted!

Bottom Line:

It's really too bad that Burton was not completely accurate with his facts regarding Lugosi and Wood.  But if he wanted to portray a strong friendship and both actors going for their dreams, then he achieved a nice piece of cinema.  Recommended.

643520,5,6303407188,"This film is at times hilarious, sad, moving, and fascinating.  You have a guy with vision, but without talent, who surrounds himself with adoring misfits while he wheedles his way into making some of the worst films in history.  It is a unique ensemble, from his girlfriend Dorothy (later a successful pop songwriter) and a washed-up Bela Lugosi to Vampira and a cast of little-knowns who are nonetheless utterly captivating.  Wood is in one of the ultimate shark towns, Hollywood, where he dreams of making it big.

The emotional center of the film is the friendship he builds with Lugosi, who is played to perfection by Martin Landau in perhaps the finest performance of his career.  Lugosi is at the end:  a morphine addict, his wife having left him, and no work.  Wood approaches him as you would a god, enticing him into a strange film he is making about his transvestism.  While they use eachother, the basis of their friendship appears real.

Of course, Wood himself is a weird mix of vaunting ambition and near-fatal incompetence.  He is a mix of contradiction:  a transvestite who loves women, with a knack for finding investors despite persistent failure, an inspired storyteller with nothing worthwhile to say.  Only in Hollywood could such a person create a niche for himself and survive into the cult status he rightly occupies.  The ride is truly great fun, yet pathetic and full of pathos.  The acting in this in uniformly first rate.

Tim Burton is quite a presence in our house, mostly from the kids' side.  This is the first film of his that I liked better than the kids, whose empathy for Wood often held back their laughs.",1297296000,,1643,4.752650176678445

643525,4,6303407188,"In 1980 , two years after Ed Wood`s alcohol related death at 54, film critic Michael Medved and his brother published ""The Golden Turkey Awards"" and gave Wood the award of being ""The Worst Director of All Time"" and naming his film Plan 9 From Outer Space  ""The Worst Film of All Time.""  The forever constipated Mr. Medved must had the biggest bowel movement of his life when he discovered that he and his brother unintentionally put the wheels in motion for the cult celebrity status of Wood who, to Medved, was little more than an object of derision.

Quite simply, Ed Wood was an outsider artist, whose medium was film.  He managed to create two highly personalized ""masterpieces"" of naive surrealism; Glen or Glenda (1953) and Plan 9 From Outer Space (1959) with ""star"" Bela Lugosi, who was clearly at the end of his tether.

In between these two films Wood made Bride of the Monster (1955) , also starring Lugosi (the only one of the three Wood films in which Lugosi actually `starred'), but that film was more of a concession to the genre and lacked the pronounced Woodian weirdness found in either Glen or Glenda or Plan 9 From Outer Space.

Fourteen years after Wood's cult status rocketed out of the pages of Medved's book, Tim Burton produced his valentine to Eddie.  Clearly, Ed Wood was as personal a film for Burton as Glen and Plan 9 had been for Wood.  Burton faced immense difficulty in mounting the project and was given what, for him, was a small budget.  Artistically, the endeavor paid off and even did so financially, in time, although it took Touchstone years to realize the film's cult potential for the DVD market.

In 1994 Tim Burton was the perfect artist to bring Ed's story to the screen.  Burton, recognizing a fellow auteur and genuine oddball, treated Wood, not with derision, but with the respect he deserved.  Before Ed Wood, Burton, although trained at Disney, was still an outsider with Hollywood backing, which makes him (in that regard) a kindred spirit to Stanley Kubrick.  Burton's first big budget feature effort had been Pee Wee's Big Adventure (1985), a zany Caligari-esque journey in craoyla colors.  The success of that film lead to bigger successes. Beetlejuice (1988) and the epic Batman (1989) followed.  Both of those films starred Burton's greatest collaborator, Michael Keaton.  Edward Sissorhands (1990) was a beautifully elegiac, quirky, flawed film.  It was also Burton's first film with future collaborator Johnny Depp.  Batman Returns  (1992) was a more personal vision of the Dark Knight in which Charles Dickens yuletide season goes straight to a superhero burlesque hell.  That film remains, to this day, the greatest film incarnation of a comic book character.

Of course, Ed Wood followed, but something happened to Burton after this film. Mars Attacks (1996) was Burton's attempt to make an Ed Wood-like film, but he didn't learn the George Stevens lesson.  Steven had made his Greatest Story Ever Told (1965) and it is one the most frustrating misfires in cinema history, featuring a sublime performance from Max Von Sydow as Christ and a damned fine one from the much put upon Charlton Heston as the Baptist.  These performances and the cinematography (Lloyd Griggs and William Mellor) are sabotaged by Stevens decision to insert cameos from a plethora of big named stars, such as John Wayne as a roman soldier.  Stevens defended this marketing decision by claiming that ""no one will notice in twenty years.""  It's been over forty years and it is still a blatantly distracting example in which marketing trumps art.  Burton repeated this mistake, treated Woodian weirdness like the Bible, and it was a major distraction.  Audiences and critics responded coolly.

After that, Burton's genuine penchant for weirdness was sacrificed for tinseled weirdness, not only apparent in all the films which have followed, but also in his personal and aesthetic preferences.  Helena Bonham Carter and Johnny Depp are hopelessly polished when compared to the likes of genuine, internalized eccentrics such as Paul Reubens, Lisa Marie and Michael Keaton.  Depp's current, most popular work may well be with Burton, but his best work remains with other directors, such as Jim Jarmusch in Dead Man (1995) and Sally Potter in The Man Who Cried (2000).  Those two directors were able to draw much more wistful, more nuanced, fully fleshed out performances from Depp.  Under Burton, Depp has become far too grandiose and obvious.

This was not yet the case when the two collaborated for Ed Wood. The renegade spirit was still in full force and Burton had the cast, crew and enthusiasm to do it justice.  Much has been written about Martin Landau's performance, and the accolades are deserving.  Landau had done prior excellent character work in Francis Ford Coppola's Tucker (1988) and Woody Allen`s Crimes and Misdemeanors (1989), both of which garnered him Academy Award nominations.  Landau would top both of these films, giving the performance of his life, as Lugosi in Ed Wood.  Even the Academy realized it and finally honored Landau's work.

Bill Murray as Bunny Breckenridge, Patricia Arquette as Kathy Wood, Jeffrey Jones as Criswell, Mike Starr as Georgie Weiss, Lisa Marie as Vampira, George Steele as Tor Johnson, and Juliette Landau as Loretta King are equally superb and followed Burton, Depp and Landau's lead in giving the freaks full dignity due.  Even the casting of Sarah Jessica Parker works since the actress proved to be just as witless, over-inflated and annoying as her character, Delores Fuller.

The film itself is, naturally, a mix of fact and fiction.  Wisely, Burton does not cover Wood's films preceeding and following Lugosi, because Ed Wood is about Ed's relationships with his fellow misfits.  The world they share together is as unique and special to them as the island of misfit toys is to a Charlie in the Box.  Even Parker, as Delores, realizes it and tells Eddie, ""This is not the real world. You have surrounded yourself with a gang of misfits and dope addicts.""  She is right, of course and, thankfully, banishes herself from the Woodian universe to forever disappear in that thick as peanut butter fog of deserved suburban obscurity.

Wood and the Plan 9 company did get baptized in a Baptist church to pacify Wood's religious backers, they did steal the rubber octopus for Bride of the Monster, and they did forget to steal the motor.  However, Ed's with meeting Orson Welles, his idol, never happened, but it is a hilarious, well done scene.  Unlike the movie, Lugosi's funeral was actually well attended ( secretly paid for by Frank Sinatra), but these are really inconsequential points.  With Ed Wood, Tim Burton cemented the legend of a fellow misfit and only Burton, in that time and place, could do it.

Half a century has passed since the premiere of Plan 9 From Outer Space and we are still discussing it and its creator.  That is for a reason.  Countless bad movies have come, gone, and remain forgotten.  There is nothing special about a bad movie, unless it is full of personality.  Ed Wood briefly was able to inject himself into a few special films, before he began to drown in his rejection.  With Plan 9 From outer Space and Glen or Glenda, Ed Wood and his art are totally inseparable.  Ed Wood's films are art.  Attempted descriptions such as ""bad"", ""good"", "" camp"", ""unintentional"" are rendered superfluous, and this is how it should be, because Ed Wood forces his audience into a completely subjective experience.  Tim Burton pays Wood the highest compliment by following suit.  Ed Wood Jr. will be remembered long after the successful and bland Ron Howards of this world are forgotten.

Tim Burton will be remembered, as well, for that period--the time of  Burton's most honest and individual films--in which he still was able to connect with the misfits and had the ability and clout to make Hollywood and audiences connect as well.  Later, he dropped the Ed Wood ball forever.  Tim Burton is no longer a misfit, a renegade spirit, or a visionary.  Today, he would not recognize or bond with Edward D. Wood, Jr.  Ed Wood was Tim Burton's actual swansong and, although a box office disappointment, it  too will be remembered long after Burton's ""more successful"" films  have vanished.  Undoubtedly,  Burton will continue to make a plethora of commercial successes; and even if it seems he shot his final wad with Ed Wood, that is still is far more than many ever get the opportunity to do.

This bio-pic about legendary B-Movie icon Ed Wood is marvelously done from every aspect of the craft. The same cannot be said for the real Ed Wood, as you'll learn here that his films where often flimsy and contrived. However, Mr. Wood's life story is highly intriguing; way more so then his body of work. If only they had behind the scenes footage from way back then...Even better we have this film!

There are many celebrities in this film and they all do a great job.  The movie is sometimes a little sad but mostly very, very, funny.  It's also an interesting story about the life of filmmaker Ed Wood Jr.",1279497600,,347,4.2615384615384615
643578,5,6303407188,"It would be the easiest thing in the world to cruelly point and laugh at Z-grade movie-maker Ed Wood. So of course, Tim Burton doesn't do that for this biopic. Instead, we're treated to a more rounded and sympathetic view of the infamous director; he is portrayed as a man who simply loved making films, and who wasn't going to let his lack of talent or money stifle his enthusiasm.

A lot of the credit must obviously go to Johnny Depp, who infuses Wood with an infectious energy and optimism. Despite laughing at his cack-handed attempts at camerawork and special effects, you cannot help but cheer for Wood and hope he can make the masterpiece he aims for. Likewise, Martin Landau provides a memorable performance as the ageing, washed-up Bela Lugosi, giving him a real presence and sense of dignity. There are some excellent supporting roles too, with Bill Murray, Patricia Arquette, and Sarah Jessica Parker turning in strong performances.

Tim Burton really nails the look and feel of the film. It's not just the black-and-white cinematography, Burton really brings out the spirit of Wood in things such as Criswell-style narration and deliberately cheesy opening credits, as well as recreating a number of famous scenes from Wood's films. You get the sense that Burton is genuinely fascinated with his subject, and that he does have respect for Wood's dedication and independence, if not his talent. The film seems to long for a (perhaps mythical) past when film-making wasn't controlled by a handful of Hollywood executives, and anyone with a camera and an idea could just go out and make the movie they wanted.

`Ed Wood' is an inspired take on Wood and his films, and a very memorable one. This is an excellent, under-rated film that ticks all the boxes: memorable performances, fantastic energy, great direction, and most importantly, an unexpected empathy with its subject. Five stars.",1275436800,2,1897,4.977917981072555
643579,5,6303407188,All I can say about this movie is that it is AWESOME. One of Burton's Best because it's the opposite of his big films yet he still Burton-izes it. A must see and must have!,1274832000,,172,3.942857142857143
643580,5,6303407188,"Ever heard of ""Suspension of Disbelief""? Well, you'll might recognize it when you see the movie, ""Plan 9 from Outer Space,"" a film that's considered by many to be the worst B-movie of all time (though the films by Uwe Boll might change that). It happens when in one shot it's day, but then in the next shot, it's night. It also happens when the shadow of a boom mike is clearly visible in one scene. This may not be acceptable to the general public, but a certain director from the 50's named Ed Wood found it to be a likable philosophy. And he followed it when he created ""Plan 9"" and other films, which are some of the worst movies ever made.

I'm going to be honest right now: I have never seen ANY of Ed Wood's films. I've never had a chance to watch any of his cult classics, but I always hear about how laughably bad they are. With so many plot holes, visible goofs, and wooden acting, they can only have been made by an eccentric fellow like Ed Wood. Before I saw Tim Burton's ""Ed Wood,"" I didn't know if I would enjoy it as much as I did while watching it. I didn't know if it was going to be an effective comedy, or if I would admire Ed for his passion for creating films of his own. Well, I saw the movie straight through, and I found it to be an effective biography. It shows a lot of sympathy towards Ed when he's struggling to create and finish his films, but at the same time, shows off his odd personality and weird imagination that a majority of people would never connect with. The film itself is shot in beautiful black and white, and the recreations of Ed's sets (as well as 50's Hollywood) seem completely accurate. Johnny Depp and Martin Landau are believable and memorable as Ed Wood and Belo Lugosi. Sarah Jessica Parker, Jeffrey Jones, Bill Murray, George Steele, and everyone else in the film give brilliant performances. The humor may not make you fall on the floor laughing, but I still think it's pretty sharp. As a fan of Tim Burton, I have taken a liking of this movie pretty fast. Maybe it'll grow on me some more after repeated viewing, but for now, I will say that it is one of Burton's greatest, as well as Johnny Depp's.

Grade: A",1268697600,,2165,4.278048780487805
643581,5,6303407188,"This is a movie about the director of some of the worst movies ever made in movie history. In honor of Ed Wood it's filmed in black and white with cheap sets, made to look just like one of the schlocky, low budget films that Ed was so famous for. If you are a fan of Ed Wood, or a fan of cheesy movies this is a must see!

For anyone who has ever asked, ""How do crappy movies get made?"" the answers can be found in this film...And it is sure to make you LAUGH too! The story begins with our struggling director as he creates the travesty ""Glen or Glenda?"" and we get some insight into Ed's personal life. The movie goes on to tell the tale of the many tragically bad yet brilliant movies that Ed went on to make...Plan 9 from Outer Space, Bride of the Monster...etc. Each movie Ed made was a cheaply made, poorly written and horribly reviewed disaster! Many were pieced together with scrap footage, shot in one take and made with no budget and it shows. The classic line ""Fine, shoot whatever bologna you want just make sure it's seven reels long!"" pretty much sums it up!

I felt sympathy for Ed, who seemed like a nice person honestly trying to make a living and doing his best to make something good. He ends up failing and making instead a legendary collection of thrown together, cheap, corny and laughable movies. We learn too about Ed's life, his ladies, his friendship with Bella Lugosi, his love for cross dressing. This movie is a tragic, quirky tale about a nice, generous guy who didn't have the money or support to make good movies...so he made bad ones instead! One thing Ed had was heart and although his movies are considered awful, in some ways they are brilliant too. It's one thing to make a bad movie...But Ed's movies are so bad they're good and that is a rare thing!

Johnny Depp is amazing in this role. It is ironic how a movie about horrible movies actually ends up being a great movie! The movie honors Ed and Johnny is very believable. Watching this helps a person truly understand all that goes into making a stinker. For every bad movie made, no matter how awful, someone somewhere thought it was a good idea. Someone had the courage (or stupidity) to press on through hardship, failure, doubt and struggle to make something the world would remember. Ed Wood will be remembered for making bad movies and this movie is a great homage to him. If you are a fan of Ed Wood movies you will love this!",1266796800,,2424,4.370288248337029
643582,5,6303407188,"Do you guys remember Edward D. Wood Jr., considered to be one of the worst directors of all time? Tim Burton did a sought-after biopic film about him as well. Let's begin. It opens with a similar intro to Plan 9 From Outer Space with The Amazing Criswell (Jeffery Jones) introducing the basis of the movie. It shows Ed Wood (Johnny Depp) struggling to join the film industry. When he hears for an offer from producer George Weiss (Mike Starr) to join in the production of a gender change film, ""I Changed My Sex!"", Ed decides to take the offer because he likes to don women disguises with pretty much any women's garments, which is hilarious! He meets his childhood Idol Bela Lugosi (Martin Landau) and they become friends and Bela joins in the movie. He wrote the script and showed to to his then-girlfriend, Dolores Fuller (Sarah Jessica Parker), who loses her mind when he reviles his secret. He is also great friends with Bunny Breckinridge (Bill Murray), who decides to undergo a gender change surgery, but later changes his mind after an accident. He changed the title of the film to ""Glen or Glenda""  with Bela beginning the film with his famous line ""Pull the String!"",and Ed was enthusiastic that he wrote, produced, directed, and starred in his own movie. Unfortunately, it failed commercially, critically and financially. He tries again to land a job at Warner Bros. and fund enough money for his next try at a movie, Bride of the Atom. That was unsuccessful, but he meets Criswell. At the bar, Ed meets Loretta King (Juliet Landau), who he thinks has enough money for his next film. Filming starts, but is put on hold. He convinced meat tycoon, Don McCoy, to fund the rest of the film, on the condition that they cast his son, Tony, and end it with a big explosion. He even meets the local Vampira Show host Vampira (Lisa Marie). As a result of Ed's transvestism and circle of friends, He and Dolores break up after the wrap party. Bela reveals to Ed that he has depression and a morphine addiction, and tries a double suicide, but Ed convinces him to get help in rehab instead. Ed eventually meets and dates Kathy O'Hara (Patricia Arquette), who doesn't mind his nature. Ed begins shooting of another film with Bela outside of his home. The group meets up at the Bride of the Monster premier, with an angry mob chasing them away and looting the car. An angry kid even gets Vampira in the chest! Sometime later, Bela dies leaving Ed without a star. Ed convinces Reynolds that his script for ""Grave Robbers from Outer Space"" will result in a box office success. He finds a stunt double for the late Bela Lugosi in Kathy's chiropractor Dr. Tom Mason (Ned Bellamy). However, Ed and the Baptists have a problem with the title and decide to change it to Plan 9 from Outer Space along with his cheap movie-making skills. The pressure from the crew caused the distressed Ed to leave the set for the nearest bar where he meets another icon Orson Wells (Vincent D'Onofrio), the director of Citizen Kane, which I am planning to see later on. Wells encourages Ed to follow his dreams, finish the movie in his vision, and take action against the producers. The film ends with the premier for Plan 9, and Ed and Kathy getting married in Las Vegas, with an epilogue showing the outcome of all the main characters. This great, underrated, and sought-after movie shows a certain charm to Ed Wood's career. He made his movies super-fast and super-cheap. He didn't care about the casting and visual effects much. He mainly focuses on the plot despite the stories being dumb. It is another outstanding film by Tim Burton that rivals Edward Scizzorhands among others. It is really funny and features a message to pursue your dreams and that in terms of movie-making, the story matters the most. Most of the actors played the parts flawlessly, but the film's portrayal of Dolores Fuller was different from the real-life version, however. The black-and-white style enhances the mood like one of those early movies from the 40's and 50's and it worked out surprisingly well. If you find this movie, buy it. It is worth it to learn about one of the underdogs of film history.

P.S. When the Golden Turkey Awards gave Ed Wood the honor for worst director of all time, after seeing this film, I would rather give that honor to Uwe Boll! He makes Ed Wood look like James Cameron! Trust me!",1265846400,,4374,4.635309278350515

The combination of the two make for a terrific movie.  Johnny Depp captures the dreamer, the inner turmoil, and the star-struck awe of Ed Wood and makes him sympathetic, lovable, and laughable.  The supporting cast of characters depicts Woods' friends and movie cohorts to a T.  In fact, it was Ed Woods bad movies that created some of our most endearing stereotypical characters and scenes.  Vampira inspired a young woman to create a character called Elvira, Mistress of the Dark.  And, of, course, there are the ""amazing"" (using the term very loosely) effects of the pie tin tied to the string for the flying saucer.  Fantastic, funny, wonderful!!  We also get to see how Ed Woods developed a friendship with the aging Bela Lugosi and cast him in what would be the movie giant's last role (with absolutely hilarious results, since Mr. Lugosi died before completing the film).  The movie is great.  Depp is great.  The supporting cast is great.  See this movie.  Then go out and get ""Plan 9 from Outer Space"" for a true experience of bad and funny movie making (Ed Woods didn't mean for it to be funny, but he couldn't help it).

643619,4,6303407188,"Ed Wood is notorious everywhere for being the worst directer ever to grace Hollywood.  I dont' exactly believe that myself like some others, he actually doesn't seem so, as there are other directors that are worse (such as Uwe Boll, who is not the answer to Ed Wood in the 21st century, by the way).  Unlike the aforementioned jerk director, Ed Wood, for all his crappy shortcomings and low budget production values that become strangely hilarious, he becomes are very likeable director, one who loves the movies and loves  And while Glen or Glenda is probably a bad movie, the whole aspect of how it's like to hold a secret actually has some weight and seems like Ed Wood, maybe, just maybe, actually had something to say (of course, that movie's message is slathered in a creepy premise, which is why I probably would never watch it even if it was made alright, but that's another story).  Ed Wood is a portrayl of all of the above, which makes this biopic very appealing.

Ed Wood's life could easily by split in many parts.  Ed Wood spans his life from Glen or Glenda to the premiere of Plan 9 From Outer Space.  His homelife, his relationship with Bela, the colorful people he encountered during this time period,and the making of his movies are all portrayed on screen. Ed Wood isn't all the way historically accurate; for example, Ed Wood never met Orson Welles, and Bela was actually married.  However, Ed Wood would keep anybody who liked Ed Wood in a way because of the way he's portrayed, and what he was doing that made him likeable is present in the movie.  Unless your part of the Golden Rasberry Awards, you'll probably end up liking Ed Wood in the movie.

Ed Wood's life wasn't all fun and games, as many of the grimmer times of his life, such as his later life with ended in death, is not here.  And I am not quite sure if the premiere  However, Tim Burton and the screenwriters specifically wanted his life to be somewhat sympathetic here, and they do very well.  It's also very funny, with outlandish situations to go along with his so bad it's good aura.  What also makes the movie is the way he interacts with many of the people, which often ends in hilarity, with some wit to go with it.  Bela is also hilarious, especially when he gets ticked off after hearing someone compare him to Boris Karloff.

The cast and director really shine.  The cast, with the offbeat Johnny Depp, very hot Patrica Arquette (though she was hotter in True Romance), Bill Murray as a tranny, Sarah Jessica Parker (she's.....she's, okay, she's not as impressive as the others), and Martin Landau. Martin Landau actually beat out Jules Winfield... errr Samuel L Jackson from Pulp Fiction (QUENTIN TARANTINO RULES! Oh sorry) in the oscars.  Actually really well deserved, unlike the best picture of 1994 (REPRESENT! Oh Sorry).  These characters are really well portrayed, letting you get involved in the life of Ed Wood and the many people who were around with him. Tim Burton's style of directing (shot in black and white) is suberb, and many artistic flourishes abound.  The cheap sets of a low budget movie, the many cheap special effects are on display, and the regular sets and shots are great.  The other academy award winner, for best makeup, was well deserved, particulary because it made Landau a great recreation of an old Bela Lugosi.  And the opening credits are a prime example of Ed Wood's fine artistic quality, with the very campy and infectious theme (which shows up as a music video in the extras) with a Theremin in use.

I really dont' quite understand however, why the film drags.  It adds some kind of an insight to the filmmaking process, or something, or at least some humor in it.  Eh, I really don't understand that claim.  Sure, Ed Wood isn't exactly a knockout (hence why it doesn't get five stars), but Ed Wood is easily my favorite biopic, with a topic that you just can't get enough of, and entertaining with some great laughs.  Tim Burton style really cements the movie and makes it a full on fine movie.  Highly recommended view of one of Hollywood's most lovable directors (in the Chicago Cubs way), further cemeted by the portrayol of this movie.

643622,5,6303407188,"This is one of the best American movies of the last 50 years, and certainly one of the very best comedies.  All the praise given out by the reviewers here and elsewhere is deserved, and I can and do say with certainty that if you aren't made of stone you will laugh your head off.

Granted, the film has been created on Wierdland's back lot -- which  Burton has staked out for himself, and which he's resolutely plowed for some years -- it appears, nevertheless, that comparing Burton's wonderful BATMAN and all his other exciting apparitions, this effort comes off best.  Why?  Complex answer required, but in a word, Humanity.

GENRE STUFF.  Everybody loves show-biz flicks, as much as they love movies and talkies themselves; from the Barrymore shows (ROYAL FAMILY) to SINGING IN THE RAIN, to A STAR IS BORN (1 and 2),  Garland and Rooney and beyond.  It's a category worthy of a book, or even a library or two.  And ED WOOD is certainly in that genre.  It's the story of a sort of idiot-savant of cinema who managed, somehow, to rise to the negative celebrity of ""The Worst Director Of All Time"" cult status.  That's a campy kind of category, both cloying and redundant.  Actually, his movies fit or mis-fit into the category of American non-studio or experimental cinema that sprang up after WW II.  Put it somewhere close to Kenneth Anger's films.  His time-frame is 50's.  That includes not only look -- costumes, sets, cars and props, but language.  And I think its here that ED WOOD separates itself from the other Burton films; the writing is just a little bit better.  The construction of the movie, scene by scene is good, but the dialogue is fabulous!  Crisp, brief, idiomatic without being either cute or campy, it has that Hollywood/USA POP culture sound of the decade.  Brilliantly done.  Ultimately, the credit for that little bit of extra something that makes this movie so unbelievably fine, belongs to the writers.

HOLLYWIERD DAZE?  OK, but whatever the movie appears to be about, the real meaning is layered: it is an expression of Faith; faith in the redemptive and transformational power of the love of the performer's trance, whether on stage or here, on sound stage and for film.  (Remember Wood's malapropism, 'Havent' you heard about the suspension of disbelief?')  It used to be that in the beginning the saying about Chaplin was, ""You take Mable Norman and a stepladder to the park, and you come back with a movie.""  That's the way it was and is, essentially, in Chaplin's LIMELIGHT or in Allen's PURPLE ROSE OF CAIRO, or one of the Bergman films about Theatre or Circus.  This movie, like those, takes place far beneath the layers of technique that disguise mediocre material and dazzle with tricks, noise and light; the conformist cinema.  It takes place in the arena of bare-knuckled, face-to-face human encounter.  Freak-to-freak, if you will.  And it exhibits a truly religious faith on one's ability to make Magic.

Personally, ED WOOD resonates with me because I spent some years working in a similar kind of never-land of semi-improvisatory theatre and film in New York, with a director equally as inept as Wood, and equally as driven, though far, far less likeable.  The memory of frantic ineptitude overwhelms me!  We called the kind of location shooting we did -- streets, interiors -- Guerilla or Hit-And-Run.  No permits.  Hurry!  Hurry!  Watch out for the cops!  Improvise.  Edit in the camera.  His career spanned 42nd St. Sexploitation shows to English Spatter Flicks.  Ugly junk, mostly.  Nothing much came of any of it, though a very few people who went on to have small or minor careers in professional cinema owe their careers largely to that first exposure.  Bad movies, but oh! the intoxication of creation without censure!",1235088000,2,3775,4.8328125

Filmed entirely in black and white it both mirrors Wood's own work and draws humor from it.  The result is one of my favorite films of all time.
The first time I watched it I spent most of the movie laughing at everything from the bad props, to the poor scripts, to Depp's even-more-optomistic-then-Spongebob portrayal of Wood, but with subsequent viewings I have come to see the sadder side of the story; Wood's failure to find success and stardom, Legosi's fall from grace and struggles with drug addiction, and the rag tag band of partners that would all share their exploits. It tells the tale of all those left in Hollywood's dustbin.
Burton splits that finest hair between tragedy and comedy in a manner that is somehow both satirical and loving.  In the end either way, it always brings tears to my eyes; sometimes they're tears of laughter, sometimes they're ones of sympathy.",1227312000,5,1037,4.625

643626,5,6303407188,"This is a sensitive film about human fallibility amazingly done up in the guise of a comedy.  Johnny Depp's Ed Wood's is terrific.  He plays a miserably flawed and totally deluded man...He plays him with sympathy and some understanding.  It would have been easier, no doubt, to have played him as a vainglorious fool, but the director and producer decided on a more complex character.  Woods is a man totally, and mistakenly, convinced of his artistic excellence.  He is so convinced in himself that he is able to convince others to invest in his ideas of cinematic art.  He produces junk, but what junk it is.  I have just finished watching 'Plan 9 from Outer Space', Wood's masterpiece.  It is too easy to say that it is 'so bad it's good.'  The fact is, with all it's funky sets, ridiculous special effects, miserable acting and over-the-top jokes, it actually is good...especially if you've had half a dozen beers.  I have very little doubt that, in 'Plan 9', Woods deliberately produced a satire on science fiction films and, more importantly, on foolish public attitudes that cause people to BELIEVE in flying saucers.

As such, 'Plan 9' is a down-at-the-mouth 'Rocky Horror Picture Show' and I have little doubt that the producers of 'Rocky' drew on this film for weird inspiration.

All the characters in ""Ed Woods' are great, especially Martin Landau as the pitiful, heroin abusing Bela Lugosi.  Landau is Lugosi.  Seldom has an actor owned a role as thoroughly as this one.  Woods, who in the movie, establishes a genuine relationship with Lugosi, tries to help him by giving him parts in ridiculous films [except that Woods doesn't know they're ridiculous].  Lugosi, as a 'big' name actor becomes Woods major playing card in his eternal search for investors and viewers.  Unfortunately, it's late in the game and Lugosi dies during the filming of Wood's Magnum Opus 'Plan 9'.  Not to worry.  Woods substitutes him with a double who hides his false identity by slouching around the set with his black cape held up to his eyes.  No kidding, I just watched 'Plan 9' and Woods really did this.

643687,5,6303407188,"It's taken me a while, but I can finally agree that Johnny Depp is one of our finest working actors.  Now that I've been able to explore his earlier work I can truly understand why the world in general loves him so much.  I just remember back in 2003 when `Pirates of the Caribbean: Curse of the Black Pearl' was released and everyone started praising Johnny Depp as the greatest actor on the planet and he finally received his first Oscar nomination, and then the following year he did `Finding Neverland' and yet again the world went crazy and he got yet another nomination, and then he did `Sweeney Todd: the Demon Barber of Fleet Street' and regardless of the fact that his singing voice is below standard he garnered himself yet another Oscar nomination.  Looking at it all I thought to myself `really, this is who they love'?  Up until that point the only other films I had seen from Depp were some of Burton's less successful films like `Sleepy Hollow', none ever sporting a necessarily grand or impressive performance from Depp.  Yes, his creation of Jack Sparrow was iconic and deserved of the praise and admiration, and maybe even that Oscar nomination, but it alone should not have garnered him instant idolization.

Then a few months ago I saw `Edward Scissorhands' and I was smitten with Johnny's performance.  There was this rawness about him, this genuine charm and appeal.  Then about a week ago I saw `Benny and Joon' and was blown away by Depp's depth of character.  Intrigued and stimulated I sought out more Depp, like `What's Eating Gilbert Grape' and yet again was left speechless at Depp's precision and grace.  Why was he not embraced for his earlier, grander performances?

This brings me to `Ed Wood', the most recent Depp film I was able to get my hands on.  Quite honestly I feel that this may be not only Depp's grandest performance, but it may be his best film (and Burton's best respectively).  Telling the story of the most famous `bad' director in Tinseltown, `Ed Wood' chronicles the working life of Edward D. Wood Jr.; a cross-dressing director longing to follow in the footsteps of Orson Welles.  Wood longs to create films but he lacks the financial support.  His plays are critical flops and his ideas and methods are a bit strange and unconventional, but after a chance meeting with famed actor Bela Lugosi, Wood finally has an edge.

Edward D. Wood Jr. has reached cult fame for his productions of `Plan 9 from Outer Space' and `Glen or Glenda' and both of those films are explored and recreated in this Burton classic.  Tim Burton and his cast really capture the spirit of 50's film; the finished product itself plays out almost like a 50's sitcom.  The performances by the entire cast are rich with charisma and charm, especially that of Depp and Landau.  Johnny Depp embodies Wood's deep-seated naivety and drive to succeed regardless of the costs.  He had a vision, and even if it was diluted with incompetence it was his vision and he was going to see it come to cultivation.  His character reminded me of a restrained version of his Willy Wonka character, or should I saw that Willy Wonka is a less controlled version of Ed Wood.  Landau blows everyone away here though, even Depp.  His portrayal of a washed up actor longing to be as loved as he once was is as heartbreaking as it is amusing.  Landau won that well deserved Oscar (I personally would have went with Samuel L. Jackson, but Landau is a very close second for me) and truly shines brightly in this very impressive film.

The rest of the cast is magic as well, everyone from Sarah Jessica Parker to the always amazing Bill Murray to Jeffrey Jones and Patricia Arquette making an impression on the viewer.  There's even a neat little cameo by Vincent D'Onofrio (vocally dubbed of course) as Orson Welles towards the end of the film.

Like Edward D. Wood Jr., Tim Burton has a vision, and what I appreciate about Burton is that he always stays true to his vision.  Sure, his gothic type roots are not as prevalent in this picture as in `Edward Scissorhands' or `Sweeney Todd' but the air and spirit, his soul and drive are seen throughout this film.  This is Burton at his finest, for instead of relying on props and visuals he draws deeply from within himself to pay tribute to not only the worst director of all time but quite possibly of one the greatest inspirations for aspiring directors today.  Sure he was no Welles (one of the greatest cinematic minds of all time) but his story is inspiring, intriguing and extremely entertaining.",1214265600,6,4546,4.6533166458072595
643688,4,6303407188,"Interestingly, I've read a lot of message boards and opinions that agree this is one of Tim Burton's worst movies.  Yet it is getting an 8.1 rating on IMDb and is currently ranked #193 on their Top 250 (his highest ranked movie as far as I can tell; higher than Beetlejuice, Edward Scissorhands, Batman, and Big Fish).

I tend to agree with the IMDb contingent.  Martin Landau's performance (as Bela Lugosi) alone makes this movie great and worth repeat viewings.  If any Oscar was more deserved than his performance (in a supporting role), I can't think of it.  Add to this Johnny Depp, who is always fantastic, and tons of minor characters played by a collection of colorful actors and actresses, and you get an entertaining, never dull film.  The movie is in black and white which turned out to be a perfect choice.  The monochrome gives it the atmosphere and feel necessary for the engaging story of the oft-called worst director of all time: Ed Wood Jr.  Tim Burton's love for Ed Wood is evident and Johnny Depp's performance makes the viewer love him as well.  This movie may not be for everyone, but I recommend that you at least rent it (everyone should see Martin Landau as Bela Lugosi).

Johnny Depp plays Ed Wood and does a wonderful job in the role, but Martin Landau stole the show with his portrayal of Bela Lugosi.  You forget you are watching Landau and actually start believing you are seeing Lugosi.  The movie is shot in black & white, which I thought would be a big downer, but it didn't detract from the movie in the least.  I forgot I was watching a black & white movie.  Ed Wood struggles and struggles and you keep hoping he will make it big, but you know in the back of your mind that he is never going to.  A lot of people will probably pass up this movie because it's not a big exciting extravaganza.  It's not really inspirational.  It's not funny, other than a couple of light moments.  In many ways I would say that it is a wonderful tribute to a man who never gave up on his dream.  His persistence and his lack of ability to never make a really good movie has earned him a unique place in movie history.  Perhaps not the way he wanted to be remembered, but he is remembered and maybe in the end that's all anyone can really hope for.",1209859200,,1246,4.210970464135021
643691,5,6303407188,"Anyone who considers himself/herself to be a creator of any kind - inventor, musician, artist, writer - will consider this movie to be their worst professional nightmare. Imagine yourself dedicated to your craft, day after day and year after year putting out what you consider to be your best work in a field that you love only to find, at the end of your life, that you have failed in every way measurable and imaginable. This is essentially the story of director Edward D. Wood, Jr. 1924-1978, who was voted the worst director in the history of film in 1980, and as a result saw a renewed interest in his films that persists even today.

Johnny Depp gives a great performance as Ed Wood as he was in the 1950's, starting with his friendship with Bela Lugosi and ending with the premiere of his best remembered film ""Plan Nine from Outer Space"" and his elopement with Kathy, who remained his wife for twenty years until his death. At this point in his life Ed's enthusiasm for his work is irrepressible. Fortunately the film ends before he descends into frustration, alcoholism, and a series of skin flicks in the 60's. The genuine friendship between Lugosi (Martin Landau) and Wood is one of the more touching parts of the film. The men settle into almost a father/son relationship with a real mutual professional admiration. Lugosi supplies Ed with a star with which he can attract investors in his films, and Wood supplies Lugosi with work and a reason to go on living. Landau's portrayal of Lugosi is phenomenal. At times you forget that you really are not watching Lugosi himself.

643693,5,6303407188,"Oh, he's just PLAYING a cross dresser. Yes, before he donned make-up and shivered our timbers, Johnny Depp played the infamous Ed Wood, the Worst Director Ever (though his films are undoubtedly entertaining), in frequent collaborator Tim Burton's 1993 biopic. The film is definitely one of both Burton's and Depp's best films, as both show great talent here and care for the subject matter.
 The film chronicles Wood's many adventures in Hollywood: meeting the incomparable Bela Lugosi (Martin Landau, who won a well-deserved Oscar), losing Girlfriend #1 Dolores Fuller (Sarah Jessica Parker) and getting Girlfriend #2 Kathy O'Hara (Patricia Arquette), and of course struggling to get his films made, like GLEN OR GLENDA? (about a struggle with transvestism and sex changes, which is greeted with laughter by its hopeful releaser, thinking it to be a practical joke), BRIDE OF THE MONSTER (originally BRIDE OF THE ATOM, and a film which took many years to make due to budget issues), and of course PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE (considered by many to be the worst film ever made... and probably the most entertaining bad movie ever). The film also shows Ed's many relationships with his frequent cast members like Lugosi, the girlfriends, Tor Johnson (George 'The Animal' Steele), Vampira (Lisa Marie), Criswell (Jeffrey Jones), and probably my favorite character, Bunny Breckinridge (a fabulous Bill Murray), who attempts a sex change in Mexico and ends up with a dead gay lover. In the end, we care for Ed and really admire his undying devotion to his films and friends, and we realize that he can't really be the worst director ever if he has that much imagination and spunk (hear that, Michael Bay?).
 The film really has an affection for everyone, and it is that ongoing sense of lightheartedness that makes the film work so much. Of course, it is tragic to see poor Bela dying of a morphine addiction (Landau again earns his Oscar here), but even that doesn't take away from the general fun of watching the movie.",1200355200,,2013,4.952662721893491

Buena Vista Home Video's long-delayed DVD release of Ed Wood makes the wait worthwhile. The source-print and anamorphic transfer keep the film's beautiful black-and-white cinematography right on target. For such a recent A-list film, the print shows a surprising amount of minor speckling, a little dirt, and some wear. The flaws are not show-stoppers at all, though videophiles aching for ""pristine"" are forewarned.

The chief attraction among the extras is the informative and entertaining commentary audio with Tim Burton, Martin Landau, writers Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski, cinematographer Stefan Czapsky, and costume designer Colleen Atwood. It's only occasionally scene-specific, and everyone except the two writers was recorded individually. All participants contribute well as they chronicle the project from its inception through its development and shooting. Burton is chatty and sounds quite pleased to talk about Wood's films (""like weird dreams"" that are almost ""poetic"" in their badness), Wood himself, and what attracted Burton to him. Burton and the writers laud Depp's performance. We get Landau's thoughts on characterization, plus good summaries on the casting and the unexpected technical challenges posed by shooting a modern film in black-and-white. Alexander and Karaszewski, talking together in the most scene-specific segments, separate the film's facts from their fictionalizations, and relate what started them thinking about Ed Wood and his passion for movie-making.

The Bonus Material menu begins with a Music Video choreographed by Toni Basil (""Hey Mickey"") and co-directed by Burton. This Ed Wood A-Go-Go oddity uses Howard Shore's main title music straight up and gives it to a Vampira-like, hair-swirling dancing girl on a Woodian graveyard set. She's accompanied by period-cheesy video effects and clips from Wood's films and Burton's feature.

""LET'S SHOOT THIS F#*%@r!"" Not your typical behind-the-scenes featurette. With no post-production gloss and no talking heads, we get instead long home-movie takes of Burton at work with Depp, Landau, and others shooting scenes such as the Plan 9 recreation and Landau's wet rubber-octopus fight. It's scored with Shore's title theme. While on the set costumed in his ""seven veils"" drag garb, Depp steps up to the camera for an impromptu intro and closing. Just raw footage with no promotional rah-rah built in, this one's a welcome change from the usual over-produced ""making-of"" marketing fluff.

""THE THEREMIN"" Composer Howard Shore gives us a primer on his score and how he used the fascinating 1920s electronic instrument that provided the ghostly oooo-weee-ooo vibe of so many 1950s sci-fi films. Theremin expert Mark Segal demonstrates how the instrument is played by moving your hands through the space between two metal rods.

""MAKING BELA"" Here's a tribute to Lugosi from Ed Wood's two Oscar-winners. Actor's actor Martin Landau discusses his studious approach to the character of Bela Lugosi. Intercut with Landau, makeup supervisor Rick Baker tells us why he would have worked on this ""labor of love"" for free if he had to. We also get footage of the real Bela and a peek into Landau's dressing room while the layers of makeup are being applied to his face.

""PIE PLATES OVER HOLLYWOOD""  Production designer Tom Duffield hosts this look through his production sketches and Polaroids. He addresses the difficulties of shooting in black-and-white with enough depth to make this extra useful for burgeoning art directors.

Five DELETED SCENES Not much was lost in these cuts, with two just trims from the octopus-stealing scene. Footage of Bunny's dirgeful parade with his mariachi band while singing ""Que Sera Sera"" through the meat-packing plant might have been an off-script throwaway, as there's no hint about where it might have appeared in the film. Other cuts give us more material on Wood and Lugosi, plus Eddie having dinner with Tor Johnson's disapproving family.

Equally skillful are all the surrounding performances, including MARTIN LANDAU (who deservedly won a Supporting Role Oscar), BILL MURRAY, who does amazing things with an underwritten role as a man eager to change his gender, JEFFREY JONES as Criswell, the Magician, and VINCENT D'ONOFRIO as Orson Welles.

But it's the caring relationship between Depp and Landau that defines the comic genius of the film and gives it heart. Both are extremely moving and adept at showing the respect and regard they had for each other when their world seemed to be falling apart. The story doesn't flinch in showing Lugosi's fall from grace with his addiction to morphine and other drugs that eventually took his life.

A near perfect recreation of the '50s Hollywood scene with its low budget studio settings, wisely photographed in the B&W manner of most of the Lugosi thrillers. Entertaining and genuinely funny, moving and absorbing all the way through.

they could have included a special doc on the man himself, etc.

Granted, Martin Landau (and the entire supporting cast) is terrific. Depp does fine, but the writers really should have included more of the story. Wood's marriage to Kathy was not smooth sailing at all, but the way it is presented here they would have you believe that it was a cake walk, etc.

There is so much more to the Ed Wood story...and wish someone, someday does it. Ed Wood was a war hero, a purple heart recipient, and the author of dozens of paperbacks.
Also, towards the end of his life, due to having been ripped off left and right by unscrupulous distributors (& other entities), heart-broken as a result, pretty much defeated...he drank heavily and died at the fairly young age of 54.

Burton and his writers give you a fairly decent and dignified version of Ed Wood's life, although it may contain more than just a pinch of sugar.

Still, after all--I have to recommend it.

On the other hand...

Wood did (more or less) what he set out to do. He made films. Not only that, but he wrote them, directed them, and starred in them (like his rolemodel Welles). While Mr. Wood is gone, he also lives on; Johnny Depp played him in a film, and people continue to buy and rent his collection. Whether or not Wood was a good director (and he wasn't), he lived his life as he wanted to live it and he found more success than most of us ever will. I think that Ed Wood is a testament to the power of believing in yourself, and never giving up on your dreams no matter the odds you face.

This film presents that story in all of its richness, whether you ultimately find Wood's character uplifting or laughable. Depp is brilliant, like he normally is: have we ever seen him the same in different films (excluding sequels)? After watching Depp as Wood, it's hard to imagine that anyone else would even have been considered. Lots of people have commented on the genius performance of Martin Landau. I'll make one more. Absolute genius. In this movie, Landau *becomes* Lugosi. It feels real, like you're there, watching Bela Lugosi. Incredible. The other roles, bigger and smaller, all come off. Excellent casting, filling the roles up with big-name actors, but never as a gimmick. Even the casting of former pro-wrestler George ""the Animal"" Steele is inspired. (One of my favorite moments is when Sarah Jessica Parker ""acts"" in one of Wood's films; nothing like a superbly talented actress demonstrating what poor acting looks like.)

One of Burton's best films. One of Depp's best films. Landau's best. A feel-good triumph. Five Stars.",1179360000,13,1955,4.690962099125365

Now that I have seen it again for the first time, I immediately went out and bought Wood's box set.

As far as the movie is concerned, Burton turns the sad and macabre into light humor.  Bela Lugosi is portrayed, if you've even seen his movies before, very well by Landau.  Depp is perfect as cross dressing Wood.  And my personal favorite:  Watch for Murray's speech about his trip to Mexico.  I about died laughing.",1176249600,11,610,4.198275862068965

It would be easy to make Ed Wood into some kind of lunatic, but through the master touch of Mr. Depp and the skillful direction of Tim Burton, the viewer comes to understand and even empathize with Ed.  This movie also has an excellent supporting cast including Bill Murray, Sarah Jessica Parker, and a brilliant portrayal of Bela Lugosi  by Martin Landau.

643824,4,6303407188,"I like this film a lot, but I would always think to myself, why make a film about the worst director of all time?  I always thought that it was kind of dumb to make a film about a director who couldn't direct his way out of a paper bag.  Ed Wood's films are truly wretched, but yet, they are memorable.  They are so horribly bad, yet, you remember them with fondness because they are so incompetently made.  Many directors go through their careers and are never heard from again.  They make indistinguishable films that go direct to DVD.  They make horrible made for TV movies, or they make lame commercials.  If they are seen, they are instantly forgotten.  You might think they were OK at the time, but you don't remember them with any fondness, and you can care less about the director of them.  However, you do remember Ed Wood's films.  Because of that, yes, he did deserve a film made about him.  Tim Burton takes many liberties with Ed Wood's life, making it a little happier than it actually was (the real Ed Wood died a penniless alcoholic), but I think he captures the essence of Ed Wood, and that was shameless mediocrity, brazen incompetence, and a self seriousness that made his films as hilariously bad as they were.  As for the actual film Ed Wood, it's beautifully shot, and the performances here are first rate, with Johnny Depp giving another amazing performance in arguably the most diverse career in Hollywood history.  Is there any role that Depp can't play?

Landau deserved the Academy Award he got for playing Bela Lugosi, and the rest of the cast is excellent as well.  A great film about a wonderfully awful director....",1174003200,5,1646,4.589041095890411

643826,5,6303407188,"Tim Burton's homage to Hollywood director, Ed Wood and his crew of movie regulars (irregulars?) is both accurately and poignantly done.  Shot in glorious black and white, ""Ed Wood"" is a bio-pic that covers Wood's attempts at cinematic greatness.  In particular, Burton features Wood's movies, ""Glen or Glenda"", ""Bride of the Monster"", and the best (worse?) of the lot, the infamous ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"".  Each are detailed in painstaking accuracy showing Wood's attempt to get them funded and then filmed.  Much of the film depicts the wonderful friendship that Wood established with the fading film star, Bela Lugosi.  Burton shows Lugosi in a sympathetic way and actor Martin Landeau is flawless in portrayal of one of Hollywood's early horror stars.  (Landeau won an Academy Award for his performance, by the way.)

In addition to Johnny Depp's great performance as Wood, other stars make great contributions to the picture.  They include, Bill Murray who's outstanding as Wood's friend, Bunny Breckinridge;  Jeffrey Jones as psychic, Criswell and Sarah Jessica Parker as Wood's girlfriend (and sometimes leading lady), Dolores Fuller.

All in all, this is a wonderful film that flows throughout with very few dull spots.  It is heartwarming and uplifting to watch Depp show the undying spirit that Ed Wood had for his films and how his next big break is right around the corner (in his mind, anyway).

Because of Wood's cinematic obscurity (or possibly because of his reputation as a director) this film will not appeal to all movie goers. However, if you are a fan of Tim Burton, Johnny Depp or the films of Ed Wood, then this wonderful little gem HAS to become part of your collection.

Presenting the Ed Wood story in glorious black-and-white certainly gives it a more authentic feel, but even more than that, Johnny Depp's performance as Mr. Edward D. Wood Jr. is top-notch.  As I watched the film, I really felt I could understand the humanity behind the most infamous low-budget, five-day-shooting-schedule pieces of cinematic flop to ever grace God's green Earth.

You see, when I first saw an Ed Wood directed movie, I thought, ""My gosh, what idiot is responsible for all this mess on the screen?""  But this wonderfully produced Ed Wood biography changed my entire outlook completely.  I now understand why the films Ed Wood made turned out so bad.  He was so motivated to produce the next Citizen Kane that he lost patience, and he didn't put in the necessary effort to refine his presentation to accepted standards.  Instead of classifying Ed as an idiot now, I classify him as a guy who just wanted to do so much in so little time that he was unable to view his films with an objective eye.

I don't think there's a more fun way to learn about the making of Bride of the Monster and Plan 9 from Outer Space than watching this historic 1994 picture.  But both Plan 9 and Bride don't have quite the story behind them that the less-popular yet more controversial transvestite-film Glen or Glenda has.  I'm telling you, the man Ed Wood has a very strange history - definitely worth taking a look at - which is the main reason I'd encourage anyone over the age of 18 to see this funny and touching biography of one of the worst writer/producer/directors of all time.",1167609600,5,1690,4.584717607973422
643830,3,6303407188,"In this charming and thoroughly entertaining film director Tim Burton takes us inside the very twisted world of proclaimed worst director ever Ed Wood. It is not so much as a sad story (Wood wouldn't want your tears, you can take or leave his films, it makes no difference to him) as it is a pathetic story. Sure we watch and laugh as he gives it his all to create his significantly bad films, but we also shake our heads and feel bad for these people. Didn't they realize what they were making? Much of our time is spent exploring the relationship between Wood and Bela Lugosi. Martin Landau plays Lugosi the same way he played Bob Ryan on ""Entourage,"" as a washed up has been who has no idea that the world has passed him by. Lugosi, having been thrown out of Hollywood like a piece of trash, is picked up by Burton who views him as his ticket to the director's chair. The plan works perfectly which is great news for Wood and not so great news for everybody else. Under Wood, Lugosi is turned into little more than a circus freak. Wood is under the impression that he is reviving his career, but in reality he is just coming dangerously close to destroying his legacy.

Ed Wood is not unlike our current movie phenom de jour Borat. Both are completely out to lunch and could not be more enthusiastic about it. Also, he is going to do things his way and nobody is going to stand in his way. You have to admit Wood was very good at turning lemons into lemonade; it is just that history has judged this lemonade to be quite bitter. If Wood didn't have enough money to finance his film, he would just sell off the leading role. If Wood didn't have enough money to pay rent, he would just barter with movie scripts and Bela Lugosi footage. Of course that move led to his set being invaded by Christians, and while they may have been making sense (in a conventional wisdom kind of way) I much preferred Wood's nonsensical approach. Burton also uses this film to discuss the idea of directorial control of a film. He uses both Wood and Orson Welles to sell the idea that directors need artistic control of their films, and I'll buy it. Producers and financers are too scared any more to make films as great as ""Citizen Kane"" or as awful as ""Plan 9 From Outer Space,"" but these are the films that people remember. Welles himself fell on tough times throughout his career but sometimes that is the price you have to pay. Everybody likes to paint ""Heaven's Gate"" as the reason why directors should not have complete control, but what about other current films in which the directors have had nearly all of the control such as ""Crash,"" ""Fahrenheit 9-11,"" and the aforementioned ""Borat."" All of these were excellent films that took risks and challenged the audience. I'm certainly not saying that Ed Wood was known for challenging his audience (unless we're talking about endurance), but without his artistic failures we wouldn't have him to kick around all these years later. . .and thus we wouldn't have this very good film. ***1/2",1163289600,6,3024,4.508196721311475

No wonder really since it's directed by one of the best directors around and written by two of the best bio-pic writers Scott Alexander & Larry Karaszewski (who, after this film, would pen the Larry Flynt bio-pic ""The People Vs. Larry Flynt"" and the Andy Kaufman bio-pic ""Man on the Moon""). It's also got an amazing cast of actors, including Oscar nominee Johnny Depp (Best Actor, 'Finding Neverland'), Oscar winner Martin Landau (Best Supporting Actor, 'Ed Wood'), Sarah Jessica Parker ('Failure to Launch'), Patricia Arquette ('True Romance'), Jeffrey Jones ('Deadwood'), and Oscar nominee Bill Murray

(Best Actor, 'Lost in Translation'). Depp plays Edward D. Wood Jr., an aspiring filmmaker who's down on his luck and lives with his girlfriend Dolores Fuller (Parker). After hearing about a film being made about a transsexual, without a script, Ed pens a script called ""Glen or Glenda.""

The movie is kind of close to Ed's heart, because Ed likes to dress in woman's clothes. But he's not gay. While walking past a shop that sells coffins Ed meets the actor Bela Lugosi (Landau), who played Dracula in the classic Universal film and recruits him to star in the Glen or Glenda film. The movie immediately bombs and is called one of the worst films ever made. Not letting it get him down, Ed goes to work on his next film ""Bride of the Atom."" After a few more films and meeting a few new people, including wrestler Tor Johnson (George ""The Animal"" Steele), TV personality Vampira (Lisa Marie), and psychic Criswell (Jones); Ed goes on to make his masterpiece ""Plan 9 From Outer Space."" The latter is the only film I've ever seen by Ed Wood. While the movie has been called the worst film ever made, it wasn't bad. It's campy and stupid; You can definitely see why it would be considered bad back then, but it was entertaining and fun to watch. Ed Wood was an interesting, and quirky, guy...Which Tim Burton makes perfectly clear here and Depp does a great job bringing Wood to life. Martin Landau gives his finest performance as Bela Lugosi, he disappears behind the persona. He looks and sounds like Lugosi. Another thing I liked about the film was that it shows us the bright time in Ed Wood's life, through his first film to his ""masterpiece."" We hear the downside of his life through the epilogue. This movie is, in the end, a loving tribute to ""B"" movies that is over-the-top yet perfect. As I said, the movie is very funny. Especially, Landau who gets some of the best lines as Lugosi.

Wood Jr., one of the most underrated actors, producers, directors of all time. Driven by an insatiable passion for pictures, he brought his imaginative visions unto the silver screen with all the resources he had available, using wile and guile, remaining the nucleus of his own creations no matter what obstacles beset him. Wood {here portrayed by Johnny Depp} struggles for recognition and gathers around him a cadre of misfits from the crew to the actors themselves:

Bela Lugosi: He meets with the legendary Bela Lugosi upon a fortuitous outing near a coffin shoppe, they quickly become friends, and remains Wood's primary star. Herein, he is portrayed as a pathos-inducing, flawed character surrounded in precious memories and the treasures of his career. Wood spends time with him watching Horror films and is regailed with tales of his experience.

Vampira {Maila Nurmi; here nicely portrayed by Lisa Marie}: Meets her at a shindig literally begging her to appear in a movie, but is coldly denied. Until later when she is fired from her career as the nocturnal hostess of a horror movie show, finally agreeing to appear in a mute role for ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"". Lugosi actually took quite a liking to her, even remarking on her ample cleavage.

Tor Johnson {played by George ""The Animal"" Steele}: A brutish wrestler whom many will recognize as a bald zombie character immortalized in Halloween mask form.

Lugosi {Martin Landau} became addicted to morphine which plagued him during this time, yet his love of films bade him on until he reaches a point of mandatory recuperation at a detox center, experiencing the horror of withdrawal, and where Wood meets his next wife after knitting Lugosi some black booties to ""match his cape"" - it was instant love after that. He eventually confesses his penchant at the local spookhouse for dressing in women's clothing, opting to get that out of the way before progressing with the relationship, and she accepts him nonetheless. His first wife became an ingrate and opted for a so-called ""normal life"".

Prompted by a brief though motivating chat with Orson Welles, his most memorable accomplishment occurs after this departure, funded, by all things, two Christian ministers whom he convinced would in turn fund several religious films. Wood and crew actually become 'baptized' to ensure this cooperation. One of the most humorous lines in the film consists of his friend 'Bunny Breckinridge' {Bill Murray} who said ""How do you do it? How do you get all your friends to get baptized just so you can make a monster movie?""

If you like Lugosi, you'll LOVE this movie.  Tim Burton treats him with respect and I appreciated his approach very much.  Ditto for Ed Wood.  The movie doesn't really laugh AT Ed Wood.  Not at all.

This is by far Burton's best work. Shot in crisp black and white, this has actors turning in career best performances. Johnny Depp is perfect as the infamously terrible filmmaker, redeemed only by his will and optimism and an iron ignorance of his own failures. Despite this, Depp's Ed Wood is so likeable that we root for him and his quest for his ever elusive `success'.

Bill Murray is nearly unrecognizable as the very neurotic and festive Bunny Breckinridge. This is the best performance I have seen him in, and does more to support the theory of Murray as a substantial actor as well as a celebrated comedy actor. However, the film belongs to Martin Landau, as his mirrored Lugosi is at times sad, bitter, pathetic, and heartwarming (at first, he sees Wood as nothing more than a harmless idiot, but later relies on Wood and cohorts as his only friends).

Wood's other friends include The Amazing Criswell, played energetically by Jeffrey Jones, and the sulking Vampira, played by Lisa Marie (her waist is literally 6 inches wide!). And last but not least the hairiest Swede ever known, Tor Johnson, played by George `The Animal' Steele.

It's the (mostly) true story of Edward D. Wood, Jr. Wood was a rabid movie-lover who passionately wanted to make movies and didn't care what he had to do to make it happen. There was just one problem: Ed Wood had about as much filmmaking talent as the megaphone he shouted through. In addition to his lack of talent, Ed liked to wear womens' clothing. Sometimes, he supposedly even directed his movies while wearing womens' clothing. His first film was a debacle called Glen or Glenda, one of the most painfully inept and mind-blowingly awful movies in the history of cinema. He followed it up with such disasters as Bride of the Monster, Night of the Ghouls and his ""masterpiece"" (so to speak), Plan 9 from Outer Space. The latter being a highly-regarded cult classic, often inaccurately cited as the worst movie of all time. Burton's film covers the making of several Wood movies, chronicling his personal struggle to get his films made, his difficulties with women, and his friendship with aging actor Bela Lugosi. Wood doesn't seem to know that his movies are terrible, either that or he just doesn't care. He's just so happy to be making movies that he doesn't care that they're awful. He wanted to be a writer-director-actor just like his idol, Orson Welles. In a way, he succeeded.

Wood is played magnificently by Johnny Depp. I believe this is Depp's best performance. He is wonderful as the passionate, relentlessly optimistic Ed Wood. He disappears into the angora sweater-wearing character. I'm not sure how Johnny Depp didn't get an Oscar nomination. He deserved it as much as anyone that year. However, Martin Landau received a well-deserved supporting actor Oscar for his portrayal of Bela Lugosi. Landau's performance is so good that you'd swear Lugosi returned from the grave to appear in the movie. Ed Wood is generally regarded as a comedy, and while it is very funny, it does have many dramatic moments as well. Depp and Landau have some really great, touching scenes together in the movie. Wood was Lugosi's only friend in the latter years of his life and their friendship is at the heart of the movie. The photography and production design are top notch. The look of 1950s Hollywood was recreated meticulously. The black-and-white photography immensely enhances the old-movie feel.

This is a great movie that is so frequently overlooked among all the great movies that came out in 1994. Even in Tim Burton's filmography, the film is often overlooked. Anyone who loves cult movies, or just movies in general should see Ed Wood. It's an offbeat, unusual masterpiece that tells a fascinating story about  a man who made up for his lack of talent with an abundance of passion.",1136678400,4,2838,4.8838174273858925
643909,5,6303407188,"In a wacky B-movie Hollywood of the mid 1950's, Johnny Depp is Ed Wood, a young, goofy optimist who dreams of directing movies.  Despite his fondness for wacky horror and sci-fi stories (and having NO talent whatsoever), Wood wiggles his way into Hollywood, and cranks out one cheesy horror/sci-fi movie after another.  Ed sees his meal-ticket when he has a chance encounter with horror film legend Bela Lugosi; now an elderly, desperate morphine addict.  Quick for his next fix, Lugosi goes to work for Wood, and the two begin an actor-director partnership together.  A sweet, gentle (and probably fictionalized) bond forms between Wood and Lugosi.

Johnny Depp is so brilliant in this role, he really captures Wood's naive optimism.  This may also be the only film where you actually see him smile!  However, it's Martin Landau (as Lugosi) that gives the story its biggest jolts of energy (or perhaps it's just hearing old people swear that always make me laugh).  Landau easily steals the movie, having won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for this role.  What ultimately makes this film a masterpiece is the impeccable reproduction and costume design of the 1950s, as well as the crisp black-and-white cinematography.  It really transports you back to those clean-cut, wide-eyed days.

The entire cast is incredible.  The music score by Howard Shore is perfect for its period, making much use of the theremin.  The detail to which this movie goes in re-creating Wood's movies are amazing, but you'll also be laughing at how awful they were.  If you love 1950s B-movies, this film will double as a documentary of how those silly films were made back then, the film functions quite well as a time warp.  ""Ed Wood"" may be trying to tell a story of how it FEELS to be in the middle of the 1950s more than anything else, and that's what draws so many to the film over and over again.  Like ""American Graffiti,"" ""Stand By Me,"" and ""Peggy Sue Got Married,"" this film perfectly captures the images, sounds and attitudes of the era it idealizes.

If you have high expectations whenever you purchase a DVD that's labeled ""Collector's Edition,"" you may be mildly disappointed here.  There are some behind-the-scenes goodies on the disc, but they are all short in length.  The film transfer and sound quality are exceptional, though.  There are also commentary tracks as well.",1136505600,,2365,4.894472361809045
643910,5,6303407188,"Easily one of Burton's very best movies and frequently overlooked because of its small scale. Depp has never been better, (which is saying something), as the relentlessly optimistic and talentless aspiring director who wants nothing more from life than the joy of making movies. His innocence and ineptitude are both touching and persuasive, gradually he builds his team of like-minded losers, dope-fiends, homosexuals, hucksters, and has-beens. Together they embark upon one crack-pot adventure after another, putting together staggeringly awful films with scotch tape, glue, rubber bands, and moxie.

The whole thing is just so much fun, and so endearing. Much has been said about Martin Landau's portrayal of Bella Lugosi and he deserves it, it's dazzling. He and Depp, (and the illusory nature of their friendship), epitomize the very essence of Hollywood, a place where demented dreams are coin of the realm and sanity is defined as the moment when two or more people share the same twisted delusion.

Many great supporting performances, especially Patricia Arquette who is infinitely more appealing than her sister. In lesser hands this would have been a mean-spirited movie.

It is Oscar Winner Martin Landau whose performance as Bela Lugosi truly embodies what this movie is all about.  His portrayal of the legendary Dracula is tragic in his quest to capitalize on a faded stardom.  The fact that he appeared in so many of Wood's movies only underscores this tragedy.

He gets caught up in this world of B movies and thinks he is part of creating great art, not realizing Ed Wood is a hacker director. His morphine addiction is portrayed very harrowingly and shows a great conflict in the perfect movie world in Ed Wood's mind. They feed off each other. Ed Wood being a great admirer and Lugosi needing to be recognized as an actor again..It really becomes a ""tragic"" comedy of sorts for both characters.

This is a kind of behind the scenes drama of a group of people who don't really have the big name, big money to be taken seriously or be given credit to make a film.

643952,4,6303407188,"So many Tim Burton movies have great ideas and beautiful visuals, but somehow go a little flat in the telling.  For example, BIG FISH had some great things to look at, along with a some fun performances...but in the end it was too pleased with itself to make an emotional impact and the ending was muddled.  BATMAN was a visual and acting delight as well, but had absolutely no suspense because the action sequences were dull...it was clearly not what interested Burton, but it meant the movie never got the pulse racing.  SLEEPY HOLLOW, with another quirky Johnny Depp performance, again never achieved any real suspense because it was too busy dwelling on cool sets and sweeping camera angles.  Burton is the master of visual flair, but he sometimes lets the ""fun"" of a good story get forgotten in all the fussiness.

ED WOOD, I'm very happy to say, does not fall into this trap.  It's one of his best two or three films (I'm thinking EDWARD SCISSORHANDS and the new CHARLIE AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY belong up there too.)  He's got the help of telling a story packed with off-the-wall (but real) characters, just like he loves.  Ed Wood, universally acknowledged as the worst director ever, is brilliantly played by Depp.  He brings an ebullience to the part, a joyful cluelessness, that really makes it work, and explains how Wood didn't quite get the fact that he had NO TALENT!

We basically follow Wood and his troupe through the making of his three ""greatest"" films...GLEN OR GLENDA, BRIDE OF THE MONSTER and PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE.  We see how Wood attracted investors, how every scene only needed to be shot once, because it was ""perfect"" and how Wood's personal obsession with cross-dressing and Angora sweaters affected his ""art.""  But mostly we see his funny and very touching relationship with Bela Lugosi, a sad old man passed the end of his career and near the end of his life.

Unlike so many Burton films, we actually feel real pain and emotion from the brilliant Martin Landau as Lugosi.  His pain at being a ""has-been"" and a drug addict is palpable.  His thick Hungarian accent drips with the pain and the self-awareness.  Lugosi is enfeebled, but his mind is always lively enough to appreciate what a wretch he has become.  Wood is just so thrilled to be close to a ""star"" that he creates the most ludicrous dialogue and characters for Lugosi...but eventually we see that Wood truly sees Lugosi as a friend too.  A hero.  Their scenes together are always interesting...and Landau steals every moment of the film he's in.  His Oscar win was richly deserved.

If you're a fan of Woods' bad movies, you'll really like the incredibly faithful reproductions of scenes from his films, particularly PLAN 9.  It's obvious that while Burton, Depp and the rest certainly realize how bad the movies were, they also understand how making those films was a small break from the sad realities of life for the crew that made them.

As I said...Depp is very good in the film.  He's a huge bundle of energy and vocal tics.  His head is constantly nodding and shaking at the same time, as he's forced to compromise this ""ideals"" again and again and again.  I've heard it suggested that he should have been nominated for an Oscar for the part...but as much as I like him in the role, I can't quite agree.  It's a very mannered performance...trying to be realistic and also evoke some of the bad acting of the films that Woods made.  In later life, Woods became a big alcoholic and the maker of soft-core adult movies.  He obviously had a dark side, but Depp has pretty much chosen to leave that out.  It's not a BAD choice, but it limits our connection with Woods as a real person just a little.

The supporting cast is very good. Bill Murray is droll, and also has the single best line in the movie.  That line is the word  ""Sure.""  You'll have to see the film to get it, but you'll know just what I mean.  Sarah Jessica Parker and Patricia Arquette are quite fine.

The film, in lovely black and white, is a humdinger.  It's rated ""R"" for some outbursts of very coarse language (pretty much from Lugosi) which are very funny, but in general, the movie is not for kids.  And if you can possibly see PLAN 9 before ED WOOD, I would recommend it.  It gives you all the context you need!  Enjoy!!!",1121644800,,4297,4.580602883355177

How he spoke to actors, his craft, and every thing that shed a bit of light on what Ed Wood was thinking when directing his so-called 'masterpiece. I was easily ammused by the black-and white shot of the entire movie and how it gave that feel of Ed Wood's filmmaking era.

The acting was top notch, both from Depp and supporting actor, Bill Murray. I wouldn't call it the greatest movie ever made, but it is one of the best i've seen simply because it goes even deeper into Hollywood and exploits the glitz and glamour for what it is.

This is a potrayal of the man who was actually dubbed Worst Dirctor. If you haven't seen it yet, watch it or rent it.

643984,5,6303407188,"Ed Wood has to be one of the most unique and enjoyable films I've ever seen.  It includes exceptional performances by Johnny Depp, Bill Murray, Sarah Jessica Parker, and Martin Landau. In the title role, Depp is amazing and I'm not exaggerating in the least.  He made his reputation with us non-mainstream Hollywood fans for this one.  When you first see him on the screen, I'm sure you'll find an element of caricature in his portrayal of the angora worshipping Wood as he's sometimes simply too cheesy to believe.  Although, a cursory glimpse at the real director's movies will let you know that this is very much how he must have been given that he consciously created, again and again, so many reels of C movie refuse.

As for Martin Landau, who plays Bela Lugosi, his performance practically steals the film from the effervescent Depp.  This great character actor certainly deserved his Oscar for this one.  It'll make you refute Bauhaus by screaming, ""Bela Lugosi Lives!""  This was also the first, and last, time that I enjoyed the work of Sarah Jessica Parker.  She has some tremendously funny lines here: ""You've surrounded yourself with freaks,"" ""Wood Productions, the mark of quality,"" and ""well, I see the usual gang of drug addicts and misfits are here.""  Lisa Marie is quite sexy as Vampira and more enticing than you could imagine.  Murray plays a gay named Bunny who longs to get a sex change but is thwarted during a hellacious trip abroad but brings a Mariachi Band home for consolation.  As for Wood, he is a cross dresser so I guess a good description of the picture on the whole could be, ""Transvestite Chic.""

Ed Wood a man with an endless supply of optimism and it wholly exists for no discernible reason.  He has no talent whatsoever, but he never let his inadequacy knock him down--at least for very long.  Lines like, ""That's the worst film you ever saw?  Well the next one will have to be better"" are typical of his reactions to adversity.  Wood's bizarre personality and childish enthusiasm makes one become attached to him whether you want to be or not.  In his own way, he is an honorable man as he stands by his friends regardless of the cost. Ed does more for Lugosi than any son could have.  His devotion to the has-been was touching.

This film is hilarious at times, especially the scene involving the opening party for ""Bride of the Monster,"" which I replayed twice.  I'm still laughing!  In summation, it's sweet, full of spirit, and joyful which makes it incredibly easy to recommend.",1119571200,5,2521,4.694760820045558

It's easier for a movie to be depressing. It's the simpler route to striking an emotional chord among audience members. If something is indescribably sad, then you can't poke fun of it. You can't laugh about it-- people DIED, dammit! And Ed Wood is one of the rare, non-depressing, actually inspirational great movies. It is uplifting- it shows how an opus (Plan 9 from outer space) can be created just out of ambition and self-confidence and determination. It shows the success that sprouts from self-acceptance. And the film is about the so-called worst director of all time! And he died of alcoholism-related things in the seventies! And yet Ed Wood still manages to be an inspiration!

So it's easy to call a happy movie cliche. Especially a happy movie with an old-fashioned directorial style (like the scene about Dolores' angora sweaters- she says something about them and he turns over to the camera with a guilty look on his countenance). But it has deep themes of friendship and it really questions society itself. The people in the movie- the freaks and outcasts- were rejected by society and then demonstrate their spark and vitality in the little movie world Ed makes.

So to conclude, it's funny, it's sad (but not overly so, almost in a textbook-like sense is it sad. What I mean by that is it shows the facts, but it doesn't dwell on them) and it's inspirational. Plus Johnny Depp is hot.",1113350400,,1567,4.649819494584838
643986,5,6303407188,"""Ed Wood"" is such a gloriously brilliant film. It's the perfect meshing of the unique talents of director Tim Burton and an almost surreal Hollywood story that probably needed to be told. Fact is indeed stranger than fiction, and ""Ed Wood"" embraces this lovable (and seedy) story of the underbelly of 1950s filmmaking.

Most of what you see in ""Ed Wood"" is true, and if Burton bends the tale for his own sensibilities, well, I doubt Mr. Wood is turning in his grave. Edward D. Wood, Jr. has long been considered the worst filmmaker in history. His resume is stocked with horror/sci-fi films from the late 50s so inept they cause unstoppable laughing fits. Churning out ""Glen or Glenda,"" ""Bride of the Monster"" and ""Plan 9 From Outer Space,"" Ed Wood created Drive-In turkeys replete with staggeringly horrid dialog, cardboard sets and atrocious acting. These outrageous films are applauded today by bad-movie connoisseurs.

Burton, whose love of old horror films is well documented, was the perfect man to make this movie. The casting choices, most notably Johnny Depp as Mr. Wood, Martin Landau as a decrepit Bela Lugosi and Bill Murray as John Breckinridge, are inspired. There's some bittersweet elements in ""Ed Wood,"" as our obsessively positive protagonist recruits one Hollywood castoff after another, forming the most unlikely repertory company in history. A drug-addicted Lugosi, wrestler Tor Johnson, a recently fired Vampira and other misfits attempt to create films from shoestring budgets, bonding due to their own failures in life.

Burton, filming in black and white with a great eye for detail, has produced a heartfelt anthem to not only the wonder of filmmaking, but to lost souls wishing to create but lacking the gift to do so. This odd troupe may be a gang of talentless hacks, but for a brief moment their club breeds kinship.

""Ed Wood"" is a tribute to sad failures within an unforgiving industry. As we see Landau's Lugosi standing in filthy water preparing to battle a rubber octopus, we realize how tragic his life has become. This one-time superstar has reached a surreal low, sinking into a Gothic Norma Desmond mire. It's a haunting snapshot, as profound as a Shakespeare tragedy. The souls of ""Ed Wood"" died struggling with dark addictions, as forgotten as paupers. Burton has given them their fairy tale of glory.",1111104000,21,2342,4.9974358974358974
643987,5,6303407188,"I knew nothing of Ed Wood going into this film, and came out somewhat of a fan. Not of his movies - apparently they're Z-class quality - but of Ed Wood himself. There is something remarkably infectious about a man who has a powerful vision, minimal talent, but refuses to give up fighting. To be honest, I wish I had his optimism - although I don't begrudge his apparent blind-eye that he turns toward his own talent.

Burton's direction was perfect, and his recreation of Plan 9 from Outer Space was absolutely hysterical. Who couldn't laugh at tiny hand made circular spaceships held aloft by fishing poles and hovering over the Hollywood sign? Especially when one catches on fire. Think of it - a metal spaceship on fire. That's a laugh-out-loud moment.

Johnny Depp proved, yet again, his impressive depth as an actor. I have no idea if he was playing a tongue in cheek Ed Wood, or if Ed Wood really did have that silly smile plastered on his face while trying to sell his pictures, but even if it didn't, it worked - brilliantly. It conveyed Wood's optimism, as well as his blindness.

The humourous audacity and the parallel tradgedy of Ed Wood's life came out effortlessly, not only through Depp's performance, but that of everyone else, particularly Martin Landau.  The fact that it's in black and white escaped me at times too, I was so engrossed in ""the moment"" in just about every scene.  This is what I love about Burton films, you get so engrossed in the worlds he creates you forget you're watching actors.

""Ed Wood"" really resonates with many people, but leaves others totally mystified. I know many people for whom this film is an all-time favorite.  Others to whom I have recommended it, who I think will flip for it, find it strange or incomprehensible.  For me, however -- and I am speaking as a long-time resident of Poughkeepsie, mind -- I think that the fact that Edward D. Wood Jr., once acclaimed The Worst Film Director Of All Time, was a native of Poughkeepsie shows that the universe is operating correctly on some unseen fundamental level.

""Ed Wood"" (the film, not the man) is presented much in the style of Ed Wood's (the man's) own movies: In black & white, and taking itself totally, absolutely seriously.  Nobody holds up a ""LAUGHTER!"" sign; you have to see the absurdity of the situations for yourself.  We see how it came to pass that the financing for Ed Wood's magnum cinematic opus ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"" was put up by the Baptist Church; how most of the spoken dialogue in ""Plan 9"" ends up being given to a Swedish pro wrestler who can barely pronounce English; how actor Bunny Breckenridge (Bill Murray) went to Mexico for a sex-change operation and came back with a Mariachi band instead.

My favorite scene has to be: The cast arriving for the premiere of an earlier Ed Wood film (before Plan 9), at a theater in a very, very rough part of town. They are extremely late, and the audience is hostile.  Within minutes of their arrival, the audience becomes a full-blown murderous mob, and Ed and co. flee for their lives.  They emerge from the theater to find that their car has been stripped.  They save themselves by the leading lady literally throwing herself in front of a passing taxi to force it to stop.  They pile into the taxi and it peels off, bricks bouncing off the rear window.  Once they manage to catch their breath, Bela Lugosi deadpans, ""Now THAT was a premiere.""

Lugosi -- played by Martin Landau, who deserved every ounce of that Oscar statue, he might as well have been channeling Lugosi's spirit, his portrayal is uncanny -- has a complex relationship with Ed Wood (Johnny Depp).  On the one hand, Ed has a genuine love and appreciation of Lugosi's work, at a time when the rest of Hollywood has written Lugosi off.  The two of them grow to become true friends and colleagues, with much mutual respect, and Ed cares for an ailing Lugosi and helps him overcome a debilitating drug addiction.  On the other hand, all of these positive vibes between the two have a twist added, one that colors their relationship as actor and director, which is that Ed Wood is a total idiot.

Other people who might find familiar territory in this film are those who have ever been involved in any kind of theater themselves.  Whenever I am with a community theater cast, gathered around our review in the local paper, I always think of Ed Wood's girlfriend Dolores Fuller (Sarah Jessica Parker) looking up from the newspaper to ask, ""Do I really have a face like a horse?""

So, depending on your sense of the bizarre, you may or may not ""get"" this film, but unlike Ed Wood's real-life output, it is not for any lack of ability in the film.  The casting is superb, and the whole atmosphere of the film is perfect right from the word go, with The Great Criswell (Jeffrey Jones) rising from the coffin to deliver his classic, wonderfully overacted introductory remarks, followed by Howard Shore's brilliantly weird opening title music with the funky bongos and the eerily wailing theremin.

The very first time I unwrapped my own laserdisc copy of ""Ed Wood"" and heard the abovementioned Howard Shore bongo/theremin music, I was so weirded out by it that I called my best friend afterwards (at two in the morning, I might add) and played it for him over the phone, saying, ""Isn't this the most bizarre thing you have ever heard?""  My friend forgave me.  I urge you, dear reader, to visit the world of the incomparable, almost unexplainable Ed Wood at least once, and I hope that you also forgive me.  --JMF",1105315200,7,4175,4.610810810810811
643991,5,6303407188,"I finally got around to seeing this movie recently and found it quite remarkable. Perhaps Tim Burton's most conventional movie ever, this biopic explores the life of B-movie director Ed Wood, who, according to conventional wisdom, is the worst filmmaker ever. An oddball prone to dressing in womens' clothing, Wood is fertile ground for the always-interesting Johnny Depp, who endows his character with great enthusiasm and likeability in spite of his eccentricity. Depp's, though, is only one of many stellar performances: Martin Landau, of course, as Dracula star Bela Lugosi; not to mention Bill Murray, Sarah Jessica Parker, and many more. Landau won a deserved Oscar for his effort as the pathetic one-time star, which is alternatingly funny and poignant. The scene where he ""fights"" the octopus has got to be one of the most riotous ever filmed. One also senses cutting satire behind the story: when Landau's character enters rehab, he remarks that he is the first celebrity to do so, and his comment about there being no such thing as bad press is especially meaningful when a hotel heiress becomes famous for taped romantic escapades. Also, the movie evokes a time when even bad films were made by passionate filmmakers, instead of in corporate boardrooms. Burton keeps the material interesting and resists the urge to go over the top, and the result is the perfect biopic.",1104883200,2,1381,5.06140350877193
644032,5,6303407188,"Get out your angorra sweaters! ""Ed Wood"" is finally out on DVD!

In what has to be one of the most uncannily cast movies, Tim Burton has struck just the right chord with ""Ed Wood."" His biopic of the worst director who ever lived (not really: MST 3000 viewers know Coleman Francis is really the worst) captures the period of feel of the 1950s with Stefan Czapsky's moody and crisp cinematography and Howard Shore's excellent tongue-in-cheek score.

Actually, ""Ed Wood"" is the film that Ed Wood himself would have made if he were more talented. Basically, the story is a ""making of"" and ""behind the scenes"" movie that follows Wood's Z-movie Hollywood career, from ""Glenn or Glenda?"" to ""Plan 9 From Outer Space."" Burton portrays Wood very sympathetically through Johnny Depp's earnest acting: His message is that Wood was an unrecognized genius. Well, sub-genius, at least.

What really grabs the viewer though, is that the characters in this movie are so perfectly cast, that the actors actually *become* their characters: Jeffrey Jones is an eerily creepy Criswell; Bill Murray shows us the Myra side of John ""Bunny"" Breckinridge; George Steele is rotund, hairy, bald and inarticulate as Tor Johnson; and, Lisa Marie has just that anorexic Lillian Munster quality as Vampira.

But, Martin Landau as the aging, dying, addicted Bela Lugosi steals the show. Not just the facial mannerisms, the accent, the bombastic acting, are right on, but so is the spirit. Landau literally pours every bit of himself into the role. It's one of the few times the Academy gave the Oscar to the right guy, and Landau deserved it not just for this sterling performance, but for decades of impeccable acting, from ""North by Northwest,"" to ""Tucker"" and ""Crimes and Misdemeanors.""

""Ed Wood"" has just the right light touch for most of its subject matter, which makes it a bonafide popcorn flick. The scenes dealing with Lugosi's heroin addiction, though, show a darker side that -- fortunately -- doesn't wallow too far into total doom and gloom. Burton's portrayal of the friendship between Wood and Lugosi was very touching without being sappy. Upbeat Wood really believed that he could bring Lugosi out of depression and addiction. He literally was the last true friend Lugosi had on Earth.

The best part of this movie is that while it is the very embodiment of camp, it's a movie, through and through, never a film.

Ed himself wouldn't have had it any other way.",1103673600,8,2445,4.905569007263923

And while it does have it's funny moments, this isn't really a comedy, and it was nothing like we expected it to be.  I'm not sure what my friend thought of the film, but I loved it.  It tells the true story (with at least one exception) of Ed Wood -- a writer/director/producer/actor -- of what are widely regarded as some of Hollywood's worst films.  But he comes across as an endearing character due to his enthusiasm and likable persona.

This is a great film, especially for Halloween (due to Wood's monster/alien themes).  Oh, and the exception mentioned above: in real life, Ed Wood did not meet Orson Welles.",1103414400,3,748,4.544776119402985
644034,5,6303407188,"""Ed Wood,"" with the possible exception of ""Batman,"" is Tim Burton's best film. It's a very funny chronicle of the life of the titular transvestite Z-grade film director, focusing on his films with Bela Lugosi (""Plan 9,"" ""Bride of the Monster,"" ""Glen or Glenda""). Johnny Depp is hilarious as Wood, and Martin Landau is absolutely astonishing as Bela Lugosi, who provides the emotional core that seperates this from most of Burton's work. In addition, the black and white photography is beautiful, and evokes the essence of the period in which Wood's awful movies were made.
This long-delayed DVD from Touchstone is in its original 1.85:1 aspect ratio. The image is sharp with hardly any scratches. Sound is equally stellar, particularly in the opening credits.
Luckily, the disc is packed with extras. Most notable is a group commentary, in which Tim Burton and writers Scott Alexander and Larry Kareszewski (sic?) do most of the talking. Fans will also appreciate ""Let's Shoot this F&%^&,"" a collection of behind-the-scenes footage hosted (rather campily) by Johnny Depp. Other featurettes are about the music, the production design, and the creation of Bela Lugosi (both with acting in makeup). There are five deleted scenes (and a hidden sixth one), one of which includes a cameo by longtime Ed Wood regular Paul Marco. A theatrical trailer and a memorable music video round out the extras.",1103328000,8,1392,5.109649122807017

This particular outing is no exception.  Depp simply shines as Ed Wood, arguably the tiredest director of all time.

While the movie itself is a fun homage to the horrible director, Tim Burton elevates the project by presenting a very touching relationship between the director and actor, Bela Lugosi, brilliantly realized by Martin Landau who more than deserved his supporting actor Oscar for his performance here.

The supporting cast of characters are all superb and this will be a movie that ranks right up there with Edward Scissorhands and Sleepy Hollow as shining examples of the pairing of Depp and Burton.

His simplicity is so endearing, as projected by Johnny Depp (one of our more unappreciated actors). I find that I put on ""Plan 9"" or ""Bride of the Monster"" for sheer entertainment more than most others. Tim Burton's very loving tribute to the misunderstood Ed becomes a loving dislay of hope, courage and confidence. Anyone who wants a dream may find it; maybe Tim's film is a guideline. This came out the same year as ""Forrest Gump"", which seemed to take over the Oscars, but this film has the distinction of winning 100% of it's nominations: only 2, the wonderful make-up, and Martin Landau's exceptional performance as Bela Lugosi. Depp is so much fun; Sarah Jessica Parker belies her later success (""Sex & the City"") as the prudish wife. Bill Murray and Jeffrey Jones are customarily hammy, which is appropriate for the characters. Especially great is a small cameo from Vincent d'Onofrio as Orson Welles, Ed's all-time idol. This film is nothing but fun, and the black and white photography is totally appropriate. Lovers of Ed will appreciate this for what it is; Ed's been given a bad rap.

644038,4,6303407188,"How ironic can it be? Tim Burton's 1994 comedy, ""Ed Wood"" is a really great film, about an absolutely terrible, film-maker. Ever since the book ""The Golden Turkey Awards"" highlighted the movies of Edward D. Wood Jr. as the 'worst films ever made', there has been a cult-like fascination with this man and his art. Here was a Director, who created movies, that were so lousy and inept, that today's audiences consider them, 'unintentional' comedies. They still remain more popular than ever, celebrated for their mediocrity. Tim Burton's movie ""Ed Wood"" looks at a short, yet very creative period in Wood's life (during the 1950's) in which he created such cinematic non-masterpieces as ""Glen or Glenda?"", ""Bride of the Monster"" and the pinacle of bad films, ""Plan 9 from Outer Space"". Ed (actor, Johnny Depp in a terrific performance) is protrayed as an optimistic, wannabe-artist, who is truely inspired to make his dreams and visions come true. Unfortunately, he was also truely untalented with no money and hardly any resources. The film comically looks at how with the help of his girlfriend, Delores (Sara Jessica Parker) and a stock company of 'fringe' actors, technicians and some rather 'colorful' friends, he struggled to get his grade-Z film epics, financed and made. An important sub-plot of the film is the friendship/business relationship Wood had with the actor, Bela Lugosi (Martin Landau) . At this point in his career the elderly, horror actor was addicted to drugs, living in near poverty and was considered ""all washed up"" by the major studios. The film shows how the star-struck, Wood befriended Lugosi and gave him some employment in his final years. Director, Tim Burton has made a really great film about creativity, inspiration and making one's dreams come true. Also, he continues with the themes, that seem to run throughout most of his films of the 'normality' and humanity of people, who are considered 'outsiders' or abnormal by the rest of society. A good example of this is the gentle humor the film bestows apon Ed Wood's unabashedly positive view of his own transvestism and obsession with angora sweaters. The whole cast of the movie is fantastic in their protrayal of these quirky characters. Johnny Depp holds the film together in his great vision of the title character. Kudos also for wonderful, comic acting turns held by both Bill Murray and Jeffrey Jones as Wood's proudly eccentric show biz friends. They made me giggle every time they were on screen. But the real scene stealer is actor Martin Landau's mesmerizing protrayal of Bela Lugosi. This guy really does 'become' the old time Dracula star and roundly deserves his 1994 Academy Award for this role. Finally, mention should be made of Cinematographer, Stephan Czapsky's beautiful, black & white photograpy, which really invokes the old time horror movies of yesteryear. After a long wait, this film has finally made it to the DVD formatt in a ""Special Edition"". The picture is crystal clear and the sound is well done. Extras include commentary from Burton and the movie's writers, theatrical trailers and a number of featurettes about the film's shooting, makeup & special effects. This movie is an interesting and humorus look at how we are inspired to create no matter how inept the outcome turns out. Highly recommended!",1100649600,3,3323,5.032667876588022
644039,5,6303407188,"This is one of my favorite films of all time, and the DVD was certainly worth the wait. I have been an Ed Wood fan since reading ""The Golden Turkey Awards"" by Harry and Michael Medved many years ago. In the Medved book, Ed Wood not only was named the ""Worst Director of All Time,"" but his masterwork, ""Plan Nine From Outer Space"" won ""Worst Movie of All Time."" That is high praise indeed, but I think the reason Ed won was because of his naive commitment to his work. A lot of directors have made a lot of worse movies than Ed did (many with astronomically larger budgets), but the devoted earnestness of Wood's films truly set them apart.

In this film, shot in perfectly suited black and white, Johnny Depp plays Ed Wood in the greatest performance of his career. Depp shines as the eccentric director, and truly brings the character to life in a way that genuinely makes the audience like and appreciate Ed. The other towering figure in the movie is that of Martin Landau (who deservedly won an Oscar for this performance) as Ed's friend Bela Lugosi, the great man of gothic horror films. Landau is mesmerizing as Lugosi, and people familiar with Wood's films will be amazed by the uncanny accuracy of his performance. Through the relationship of these two men, the audience really comes to appreciate Wood's fundamental humanity. I can't say enough about Landau's performance. Rarely has there ever been another biopic performance as accurate or powerful.

The film traces Ed's film career from his personal statement about angora in ""Glen or Glenda,"" through the ""Bride of the Monster"" debacle (the scene of Bela flailng with the unmotorized octopus alone is worth the price of the DVD), and finally to his opus, the film for which he will always be remembered, ""Plan Nine From Outer Space."" The sets throughout the film are absolutely perfect, and the interesting thing is how Director Tim Burton made the ""Wood"" sets look perfectly shoddy, without making them into a parody. The lighting and makeup are also perfect (Rick Baker also won an Oscar for makeup) and greatly enhance the period feel of the film.

Tim Burton will always have a special place in my heart for thoughtfully casting original Wood regulars Paul Marco, Conrad Brooks and Gregory Walcott in small roles. That was a greatly appreciated and gentlemanly touch.

The DVD was definitely worth the wait. There are several ""making of"" features (one featuring Johnny Depp in drag in a meat packing plant), the original trailer, commentary from several principals of the film, and a delightful (and extremely strange) music video, directed by, of all people, Toni Basil.

This is a great movie, and from what I have read about Wood, is generally quite accurate. The entire supporting cast is fabulous (particularly Bill Murray), and they truly manage to capture the essence of the Ed Wood experience. This is suitable for all audiences except young children. There are some language issues, and some issues of confused sexuality (crossdressing; angora fetish) that are not suitable for pre-teens.

Ed Wood finally got the recognition he deserved; I only wish he were around to enjoy it. He died in poverty in 1978. I recommend this film without any reservations. Thank you, Tim Burton.",1100476800,4,3253,4.862815884476534

That said, it took a director of Tim Burton's calibre and an actor as quirky as Johnny Depp to make ED WOOD the delight it is.  And Martin Landau, as the washed up Bela Lugosi, is amazing. This film works on two levels, as I see it:  for those who have never seen an Ed Wood film, they'll probably buy or rent anything they can get a hold of just to see if the Tim Burton film is for real; for those who have seen the Ed Wood oeuvre, the Burton film will feel like an eerie documentary that captures the essence of Wood, and then some.  In other words, you can't lose!

So when it was finally being released on DVD (without being recalled), I was looking forward to it.

I'm not familiar with the rest of Ed Wood's films that much. But when this film showed Ed Wood (played by Johnny Depp)filming those other films, it wasn't boring. It was entertaining to just see how out of his mind Ed Wood really was - especially when he directs Bela Lugosi (played wonderfully by Martin Landau) to start pulling the Octopus' legs over himself, making it supposedly look like he is being attacked by it. Of course it looks ridiculous, and that's what's great about it.

I also liked how this film was not only Ed Wood's life story, but also Bela Lugosi's. I'm a big fan of him too, and it was cool to see the friendship between Wood and Lugosi develop and to see that Ed Wood generally cared for him.

The only thing I wish they did more of was the Plan 9 stuff. It kind of seemed like they took their time with 3/4 of the movie, and sort of rushed through the point in Ed Wood's life where he films Plan 9. To me, while they did an excellent job at recreating what the original film looked like, I wish they would've given us more because Plan 9 was Ed Wood's most remembered film. Perhaps if they took out some of the plot that focuses on Ed Wood's fetish with woman's clothing, they'd have more room for the story of how Plan 9 came to be.

I loved the atmosphere created in this film. It totally reflected the time period that Ed Wood's films came out in. And they really got the whole ""feel"" of his films down perfectly when we saw him filming them in the movie. And of course the fact that the whole movie was filmed in black and white helps a great deal.

The movie was very entertaining overall. I think any audience can enjoy it. But ultimately, it's only the people who've seen Ed Wood's original films that will really get a kick out of it.

The special features are ok. I enjoyed the one on how they made the music. I'm not too fond of the music video. It was just outright weird. But it did fit in with the style of Ed Wood. Everything else is fairly interesting, and worth a look.",1100131200,2,2289,4.1909090909090905

644074,5,6303407188,"""Ed Wood"" is a classic about a man with a vision. He has vision but no talent. Originally set to be released late last year, there was a delay due to one of the featurettes (later removed). Like Burton, I grew up watching many of Wood's ""epics"" that substituted desire and passion for talent and money. Wood's story is an example of the little filmmaker who could regardless of the obstacles.  How else explain ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"" or ""Glen or Glenda?"" What's great about ""Ed Wood"" is you can actually see how everyone bought into his nutty movie ideas. Wood made Super 8 or Digital movies with no budget before anyone else. In that sense, he was ahead of his time.

""Ed Wood"" chronicles Wood's difficulty in getting his low-budget visions on film such as ""Bride of the Monster"" and ""Plan 9"" featuring the marvelous actor Bela Lugosi who had fallen on hard times due to his addiction to morphine and an indifferent Hollywood community that didn't care about the talented actor who helped create the horror genre in the 30's with ""Dracula"". It's as much about the friendship and bond between these two men as it is the challenges Wood faced. It's touching, funny, tragic and dramatic all the best elements for an entertaining and memorable movie.

The undercurrent of comedy that infuses this film also has a touch of tragedy as well. When Wood realizes that he needs a monster Octopus for his no budget ""Bride of the Monster"" for down on his luck actor Bela Lugosi to tangle with at the conclusion does he rent it or borrow it? No, he steals it because he doesn't have the money to borrow it from the studio. So, in one of the funniest scenes cut from the movie, part of Wood's cast climbs over the studio fence in the middle of the night. When ""actor"" and former wrestler Tor Johnson can't climb the gate (he's just too darn big), he actually breaks the chain and they rush in to take what they need in a scene that could have come out of a classic Marx Brothers comedy.

The entire cast gives a great performance particularly Academy Award Winner Martin Landau as Lugosi. Landau got his start with Hitchcock's ""North by Northwest"" and went on to work with other giants of cinema of cinema including George Stevens. Later, he went on to fame on ""Mission: Impossible"" and ""Space: 1999"". Landau, no stranger to being down on his luck after disappearing into low budget films in the late 70's and 80's, found much in common with Lugosi. A great American actor who finally was recognized for his talent again with roles in ""Tucker"", ""Crimes and Misdemeanors"",""The Majestic"", ""The X-Files: Fight The Future"" and others. A brilliant performance that pays tribute to Lugosi and adds humanity to the film, Landau was rightly recognized for with the Oscar and, in a sense, Lugosi was honored as well.

This special edition comes with a number of great featurettes including one that discusses that elusive and popular instrument for science fiction and horror films the teremin. There's also a discussion from make up ace Rick Baker about his make up design for Landau to transform into Lugosi and how he literally did the film as a labor of love. The behind-the-scenes footage hosted by Johnny Depp is, at times, hilarious particularly the footage with Depp in drag. ""Pie Plates Over Hollywood"" provides both a nice perspective on Wood, his passion for films and Burton's desire to make the film. There's also trailers, a music video and a marvelous commentary track by Burton, Landau, writers Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski as well as other crew members. The deleted scenes are also pretty darn good and it's clear most were only cut for pacing.

Picture quality is stellar with a sharp and handsome anamorphic transfer in glorious black and white (in tribute to Wood and the era). The only thing missing is the featurette that Tim Burton demanded be removed about the history of cross-dressing. Evidently he felt it wasn't appropriate and poked a bit too much fun at Wood (at least that's what I've heard). Was it essential to the set? No but it would have been nice and I don't think anyone would have been offended by the featurette.

644079,4,6303407188,"Let's close this subject right at the start.  Wood in no way deserves the reputation as the worst filmmaker ever.  The mere fact this movies live on some 40 and 50 years after they were made attest to this fact.

You need browse the horror aisles in your local video store and grab just about ANY movie from the 70's or 80's and you can find worse movies than Plan 9 or Bride of the Monster.

I've read several interviews with people who knew Wood, including Sc-Fi collector Bob Burns and they all say that JOhnny Depp absolutely nailed down Wood to a T in his frentic performance of the ever optimistic director.

These are NOT ""B"" movies...these are ""Z"" movies and what Wood was able to do on such a limit is really amazing.  And despite his resources, Wood always directed as if he were John Ford or Michael Curtiz.

While Depp was fantastic, the best performance of the film goes to Martin Landau with his haunting performance of horror legend Bela Lugosi.  Not only did he capture Lugosi's look but also the voice and mannerisms as well.

Lugosi, long past his prime, addicted to drugs, estranged from his son and long forgotten in Hollywood...nonetheless, Bela always gave EVERY performance his 110% best effort.  Landau really captures this, particularly in the scene where he is in the water wrestling with a rubber octopus.  Absolutely histerical!

Thank God Tim Burton knew that Wood, while hardly a genius, was a man with unique ideas and skills and brought his story to the screen.  Wonderful film!",1098230400,7,1510,4.674242424242424
644080,5,6303407188,"If anyone were to ever make a story about Ed Wood, it would have to Burton, Depp and Landau.  The team that made this movie is phenomenal and did a tremendous job making this film.  I'm so glad it's finally out and I never had to pay $50 on eBay!",1098144000,4,246,3.9
644151,5,6303407188,"Ed Wood is a gloriously atmospheric, black and white love letter to cinema. Tim Burton understands that for the devoted cineaste, the best moments in life have often been spent in a darkened movie theatre being enveloped by a film and becoming one with the environment it creates for two hours. Watching a movie is a form of escape from the harsh realities of the real world and Ed Wood argues that making films can also do the same thing. No one understands and appreciates this devotion to cinema more than Burton. From Beetlejuice to Mars Attacks!, his films are lovingly crafted homages to the horror and science fiction B-movies that the director enjoyed in his childhood. With Ed Wood, Burton indulges this obsession completely by telling the story of a man who loved to create and watch movies.

There is a three minute music video directed by Tim Burton that features Howard Shore's atmospheric score with a strange, yet sexy interpretative dance by a Vampira look-alike (Lisa Marie?) mixed with clips from the movie.

""Let's Shoot This F#*%@r!"" is a 14-minute featurette introduced by a cheeky Johnny Depp dressed in drag. What follows is a montage of behind-the-scenes footage of certain scenes being filmed and Burton directing his actors.

""The Theremin"" is a look at this unique musical instrument whose signature sound was used in countless science fiction and horror films over the years.

""Making Bela"" examines how Rick Baker transformed Martin Landau into Bela Lugosi. The actor talks about his take on Lugosi while Baker speaks about how he got the gig and his approach to Landau's make-up.

Production designer Tom Duffield examines the challenges of making a black and white film in ""Pie Plates Over Hollywood."" He also talks about how he achieved the retro `50s look and his goal of aping the flat look of Wood's movies.

There is also a theatrical trailer.

The best and most substantial extra on the disc is an audio commentary with Tim Burton, Martin Landau, the film's screenwriters Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski, director of photography Stefan Czapsky and costume designer Colleen Atwood. Landau introduces the commentary and all of its participants affecting Bela Lugosi's accent and voice, which is a nice touch and gets one in the spirit of the movie. This is an excellent commentary with a lot of detail and insights. This is a must-listen for any fan of the movie.

Finally, there are five deleted scenes that include an insightful bit where Ed has dinner with Tor and his family. Best of all is Bill Murray singing ""Que Sera Sera"" with a mariachi band.

Ed Wood has endured. It went on to win two Academy Awards (one for Landau's performance and one for Rick Baker's make-up) and a slew of critics' awards. The movie has also become a favourite of film buffs everywhere, which is rather fitting considering that this is exactly its target audience. Sadly, Burton went on to make Planet of the Apes, a paint-by-numbers action film with expensive computer effects that lacked any of Burton's distinctive personality-the complete antithesis to Ed Wood. Hopefully, he has not become completely absorbed by the Hollywood system and that there is still some of the spirit of Ed Wood left in him.",1098144000,11,3230,4.911926605504587
644152,5,6303407188,"I watched this movie for the first time last night after buying it and I enjoyed it so much. This movie has such a sweetness about it. Ed is such a  kind hearted sympathetic guy that you can't help but root for him all the way and cringe when he gets a setback. I thought it was so sad when Bela died. The film had so many touching moments.

Johnny was a perfect Ed. I think he captured him perfectly and gave an honest fair portrait of him. Its  tragic that the real Ed died without ever seeing the cult status and recognition he enjoys today.

Another great thing about the movie is it had that total 1950s  creepy atmosphere which I absolutely love. I highly recommend it.",1095033600,3,675,4.2421875

644154,5,6303407188,"Watching Ed Wood movies and watching Ed Wood there is an alarming thing - Ed Wood's life was better suited to a movie than he was as a director! And as he tried woefully to express this side of his personality to the public with the woeful Glen or Glenda ( "" Did you see the movie? Uh huh. Worst movie you saw in your life? OK but how about.....hello hello! )
Johnny Depp is hilarious as Ed and really plays the part extraordinarily well. You almost feel sorry for him as he gets rejected from everyone because he seems to have his intentions right no matter how skewed they end up being.
Of course Ed has a fetish for women's clothing which would make itself known in the film Glen or Glenda but Dolores wouldn't know about this until she read the script. Let's just say she doesn't take to it as well as Ed's rather naive script would like her to be! Although I have to admit that Sarah Jessica Parker is not exactly that easy to like in the movie
Martin Landau is the one who I think plays Bela Lugosi and I have to say that the resemblance is uncanny that you almost feel like singing the line from the Bauhaus song Bela Lugosi's Dead -"" Oh Bela, Bela's not dead "" indeed!
Bill Murray is fantastic in his role. As ever, he has the best lines in this movie. One of the best roles I've seen him in
I've seen this film - it must be about nearly 7 or 8 times and it's so funny that some of the lines in it are implanted in my head. One that has to be watched for those interested in seeing something a little unusual",1088380800,18,1516,4.090604026845638

After all, most of the movies I enjoy the most are movies that are panned viciously by said critics. Guess what? for once, I agreed with the ""screen snobs"" and enjoyed this movie just as much as the ones normally dismissed by the critics.
Johnny Depp is brilliant as the ever optimistic, supremely untalented Ed Wood. It is strange to contemplate the irony that it took such a top notch director, cast and writer to honor someone like Ed.
Speaking of brilliant, don't miss Martin Landau's Oscar winning turn as Bela Lugosi. By turns hilariously profane and poignantly troubled, Landau earned his Oscar for this part.

644156,5,6303407188,"Ed Wood (1924-1978) is generally regarded as the single worst film maker to emerge from Hollywood.  This is not really true, for there were and are aplenty worse.  But one thing has always set Wood above the pack, and that was his own unshakable faith in his talent.  Unfortunately, the faith was misplaced and the talent was nonexistent--and although this Tim Burton film takes a slew of liberties with the facts of Wood's life and career, it does a remarkable job of capturing them as Wood likely saw them through the filter of his own outrageous ego.

The film has two tremendous assets: the performers and its visual style.  Johnny Depp leads the cast in the title role, and it is a virtuoso performance, for he entices us to like a man whose self-blindness would normally lead an audience to reject him out of hand; the performance is incredibly witty, wildly over the top, and yet it contains just enough pathos to allow us to relate to Wood on a human level.  But the real stunner in the cast is Martin Landau, who picked up a Best Supporting Academy Award for his performance as Bela Lugosi, a legendary actor who was very much a forgotten star (not to mention morphine addict) by the time Wood befriended him in the early 1950s.

As with Wood himself, the film plays fast and loose with the facts of Lugosi's life, but it nonetheless captures something very essential about both Lugosi and the Hollywood that destroyed him, something very elemental that transcends the weird comedy of the piece.  And Landau gives the performance of his career; you truly believe that this is Lugosi before you, a strange but appealing mixture of faltering humanity and arrogance desperate for an audience now lost to him.  Other memorable performances include Bill Murray as the inept and very la-dee-dah actor Bunny Breckinridge; Jeffrey Jones as The Amazing Criswell, popular ""psychic"" and occasional Wood actor; Lisa Marie as television's ""Vampira;"" and Sarah Jessica Parker as Wood's fast wife and occasional actress Dolores Fuller.  Indeed, there isn't a false note in the entire cast right down to the bit players and extras.

In terms of visual style, Tim Burton nails the very look of an Ed Wood film in glittering black and white--but working with a budget that Wood never dreamed of he merges it with a series of classic Hollywood idioms that lift the style out of Wood's unfortunately flat style and into the realm of high art.  In both look and direction, I strongly feel that this is Burton's single finest film to date.

If the film has a flaw, it is that at times it recreates the flatness of an Ed Wood film a bit too precisely over too long a period--and the result can feel slightly dragged.  And it is also a film that will register most clearly with those who have actually seen the films on which the movie focuses, so it may not appeal to the uninitiated.  But for those who have the right eye, it is a remarkable film--and a film that desperately needs the DVD release that has been so repeatedly postponed.  Wickedly funny, unexpectedly touching, extremely memorable... and strongly recommended.

644157,5,6303407188,"Ed Wood (Johnny Depp), is a positive film enthusiast without strong skills in story telling, yet driven to tell the audience his story.  Ed's stories display little interest in perfection as they openly display imperfections which eliminate the magically believable moment.  However, it is these imperfections that Tim Burton highlights in Ed Wood where he displays Ed's imperfections and peculiarities to bring out the human side of Ed, which is what makes him lovable.  In filmmaking Ed might have received an F as he was awarded ""worst director ever"", but as a human he should get an A.  Tim Burton decided to film Ed Wood in black and white which vividly enhances the contrast in Ed's character.  In addition, the performance by the cast is outstanding as they add phony mood to the film, but it works like magic in this brilliant story.",1084147200,8,841,4.853146853146853
644158,5,6303407188,"First of all, I will tell you that I was raised in Hollywood in the 1950s and our upstairs neighbor really was the ""Great Criswell"" depicted in this film.. so I should be more critical than anyone concerning this movie's authenticity, and it is a perfect depiction in my view. This masterpiece by film maker Tim Burton is not only a sensitive, funny and wonderous portrait of Ed Wood, Jr. and his pals, but also a loving tribute to the spirit of the last ""Great Days of Old Hollywood"". The performances by Johnny Depp and the supporting cast is perfection. Visually, this appropriately black and white film takes on the look of those low budget films Ed and many others were making at the time. Even the opening credits AND Howard Shore's INCREDIBLE music score feels accurate to the time and is a joy to hear.
I was very honored when staying at the LeParc Hotel in West Hollywood in early March of this year and happened to be in the lobby when I spotted Martin Landau.  I seized the opportunity to walk over and tell Mr. Landau how ""fabulous"" he was in his role as the late Bela Lugosi..... he smiled and kindly said ""Thank you so very much!!""... and his performance IS INCREDIBLE... enough that he won the Oscar for his performance in this film. Landau's characterization of Lugosi alone will be worth the price of the DVD when Disney decides to release it (soon I hope!!).

Quite a stunning film about Ed Wood, who I was honestly unaware of in Hollywood history.  Great performances, great characters, story-line was generally good for a biography type piece.
Okay, yes, Johnny Depp proved that he has acting abilities that no actor should be capable of having.  I could barely...barely, find an ounce of him in this part.  What is interesting is that you can still ""see"" Johnny when he takes on his roles like they ARE him, yet they aren't like him.  But essentially they really are him.  Difficult to explain this feeling but this movie truly made me see that.
Truly great performances by the other magnificent actors too.  Bill Murray held his natural sense-of-humor without acting like he has one, didn't even recognize Vincent D'Onofrio as Orsen Wells, and admired Bela aka Landeu's perfromance tremendously(sp?)",1081296000,,988,4.839285714285714
644175,4,6303407188,"This is Tim Burton saying that no matter how many people don't care about B-horror pictures, he does, and showing us that there can be poetry in them. ""Ed Wood"" is a bio-pic of real-life B-hollywood director Edward D Wood Jr, done in the style of one of his pictures - unexplained framing devices, like Criswell's introduction, noirish lighting for no apparent reason, and incidental performances by actors who look like they've just shown up and not been told what part they're supposed to be playing. These last, like the doctor in Lugosi's hospital, are provided for colour, but are an example of the balance struck in this picture. It has the expression of a comedy - yes, we're asked to laugh at Wood's haphazard way of making pictures, and we can laugh about how terrible the pictures are, but beneath the comedy a great truth is found, and a message Tim Burton is passionate about is expressed. The heart of Ed Wood is really in the character of ""washed-up"" Dracula star Bela Lugosi (played to a tee and rewarded with an Oscar, by Martin Landau).
Twenty years after Dracula, Lugosi's career was over. Nobody cared about him. It was like, as is Hollywood lore, you're only as good as the last thing you've done. And whatever classic roles or films you may have done, it all counts for nothing if you do a bad picture. This theme of the cruel way Hollywood forgets its greatest talents is also why the name Orson Welles keeps cropping up. Its not because Welles made pictures like Ed Wood's, its because, like with Lugosi, Welles's having made what is considered to be the greatest picture of all time, Citizen Kane, counted for nothing in Hollywood. If your pictures didn't make money, you were useless - so Hollywood did everything it could to keep him from working - RKO sabotaged his Ambersons, and eventually he could not get backing for many great pictures in Hollywood that, and here there is another analogy with Ed Wood, he raised money for himself and made independently. It is this determination to succeed, and persist in your work no matter what others think of it that makes Ed Wood (thanks to a terrific fun performance from Johnny Depp) such an important and admirable character. You can't help liking Ed, for his irrepressible spirit and optimism. It was Ed Wood who gave Lugosi another chance, the content of which Burton romanticises and focuses on in his film. Ed Wood cared about Lugosi's work - Wood didn't care about popular opinion which said Lugosi was ""washed up,"" whatever that meant. Wood had seen Dracula, and Lugosi was a legend, and that was all that mattered. Wood gave him the chance to be in pictures again, symbolising the appreciation of great works, not recent moneymakers. Burton and Martin Landau give the legend of Bela Lugosi his last great performance, turning him into the tragic figure to end all tragic figures. His performance of his ""I have no home speech"" set to stirring, haunting music, on the steps of the hospital - his performance of the infamous flower-smelling scene from Plan Nine from Outer Space, the last footage Lugosi ever shot - all have the tone of appreciating a legend, giving Lugosi his due, saying who gives a [woop] if Hollywood doesn't remember, we remember.",1079654400,8,3232,4.7424511545293075

Absent any statement from Buena Vista, we may as well conclude that they postoponed the release (again) until after the Academy Awards, hoping that Depp or Murray will win. Then they can change the packaging to reflect the Oscar victory and release it with fanfare.
Yet another predictably stupid marketing ploy. These middle management stiffs have to impose a lame idea on everything; They are only alienating the viewers who really want this disc; as for the potential sales boost from a Depp or Murray Oscar victory, do they think that those buyers would be less likely to purchase it because it's already been out for a month?

On 'Deleted Scenes' menu, highlight 'Que Sera Sera', then press right on your DVD remote 2 or 3 times to highlight the lightning bolt, and reveal the scene. The Lugosi special is neat.

First off,
The only perceptible thing about this DVD that says recall, is my copy has a messed up Scene Selections menu.  When you arrive at the Scene selection screen, it comes up blank.  Only after you select a highlight on the blank screen will something appear on it.
Presentation:
The DVD is a VERY clean transfer.  Bit rate ranges from high 4's to high 7's.  I know how freaky black levels get on DVD's, and this one does a bang up job with the material.
The audio is good too.  It does stay kinda front heavy, only filling surround on score and on a few scenes where incedental SoundFX (like Bela's dogs barking...)  This isn't the movie you whip out to impress the friends with your setup, but it is very balanced for the feature.  Ed never got to do a 5.1 mix, so it's only fair... :)
I've only given a small glance at the extras, but all of them are fairly intriguing, with the Theramin one being a full on lesson on how to best play it.  The directors commentary is full of informative facts regarding the production's following reality and how it strays from it for embellishment's sake.  They stayed pretty true...
Overall, if the bad menu was the only REAL reason it was pulled, they've got some really lousy product testers...

He keeps making horrible movies, but somehow he keeps getting chances to make more movies; it's almost a modern day Candide.

644232,5,6303407188,"There was a time when I regarded Johnny Depp as being basically another young pretty-boy actor, and let's face it --- there was a time when he was marketed as being exactly that.  When an actor is marketed on the basis of his good looks, rather than his talent, it becomes hard to take him seriously at his craft.
Then Johnny Depp appeared in this bizarre hommage to naive optimism abd true committment to one's craft.  As Ed Wood, Depp touchingly portrays a man who is amazingly unaware of his own breath-taking incompetence.  One is left with the image of a man who had the heart & soul of an artist, albeit an artist with no corresponding talent whatsoever.
One would think you should be feeling sorry for Ed Wood, because he really really sucked at what he loved doing most, but if this portrayal is to be believed, he was so committed to his craft that he spent little time feeling sorry for himself.  Strangely enough, that strikes me as being truly heroic & admirable.
I had never seen Depp play a role such as this before, and it gave me a new respect for the man's talents as an actor.  He has played some off-the-wall characters since that time, and one cannot help but see a hint of Ed Wood in Depp's rather unconventional turn as Captain Jack Sparrow in last year's ""Pirates of the Caribbean.""

644265,5,6303407188,"Why make a movie about the man universally regarded as the worst filmmaker of all time?
Well, simply because the word ""worst"" does not even adequately describe Ed Wood. He was the absolute, undisputable worst, unrivalled in his mindless disregard for decent production values, coherent storytelling, credible scriptwriting, and competent acting. If he were just ""the worst,"" he would be no more than a mere footnote in cinematic history. But by single-handedly redefining the standards of ineptitude, Wood achieved that rare status of lovable loser. I mean, really, you have to admire someone who approaches his craft with so much grit and determination and so little talent.
It takes an A-grade cast to bring to life this story of Z-grade moviemaking. And we have one. Johnny Depp delivers a performance of fire in the title role, giving us a lot of insight into the character that Ed Wood was. Martin Landau (in an Oscar-winning performance) doesn't just portray Bela Lugosi. By golly, he becomes Lugosi, almost convincing us that the horror movie legend was resurrected for this project. Sarah Jessica Parker, Jeffrey Jones, Bill Murray, George ""The Animal"" Steele, and Lisa Marie comprise the ensemble cast that portrays a motley crew of rank amateurs. Think about it, these people had to re-enact the shooting of Wood's movies, looking serious but coming out funny, and doing all that with a straight face. Try that, folks.
Appreciate too, the film's most memorable line. At the premiere night of Plan 9 From Outer Space, Wood declares with unqualified conviction: ""This is it. This is the one I'll be remembered for.""

Known for his love of oddball characters and misfits, Burton turns his empathic eye toward the man who's been roundly labeled ""The Worst Director of All Time"". But in Wood's mind, played with sincerity and humor by Johnny Depp, he is a true artist because he actually believes that his films are good. A refreshing breeze of naivete in today's world of hyper-bloated blockbusters, sequels and video-game-to-screen eye candy.
And Martin Landau's Bela Lugosi is by turns invigorating and touching as the horror icon made human, and one of the first Hollywood has-beens from the talkies era. Burton depicts his sad descent into addiction and obscurity as more of a horror than anything Lugosi ever committed to the silver screen.
Excellent performances by all; my favorite being Bill Murray as the deliciously effete Galactic Ruler in ""Plan 9"". Howard Shore once again delivers an astonishingly poetic and moving musical score, proving that he is one of the most versatile and gifted composers since John Williams.

644306,5,6303407188,"Doubtlessly the most underrated and misunderstood movie in this brilliant director's career - look, it isn't even available on DVD yet! - Ed Wood is one of Tim Burton's best movies, right up there with his four timeless masterpieces - Edward Scissorhands, Beetlejuice, The Nightmare Before Christmas and Batman. It's very different from anything else he's done before, though. Even the music is different - it was composed by Howard Shore (`The Lord Of The Rings') instead of Tim's regular partner since the beginning, the brilliant Danny Elfman. Few of Burton's beloved motifs are to be found here. I think the reason is that he meant for Ed Wood to look like an Ed Wood film rather than a Tim Burton film - and it works, down to the black & white and the cheesy dialogue. It's a camp masterpiece, and essential for Burton fans.
Granted, Tim's choice of subject matter for this film - a biography of the worst director in history - may seem odd, but then again he was never the kind of director who repeats himself (except for the excellent Batman Returns, of course). And in his skilled hands, the rather messy storyline makes for a wonderful comedy that is absolutely hilarious - but also, at times, touching. The character of Edward Wood (played skillfully by the one and only Johnny Depp) is so absolutely pathetic that he can really get to you - his incredible ambition even at the face of repeating failure (""...The worst movie you ever saw? Well, my next one will be even better!""), his childish enthusiasm, his absolute assurance in his `vision' (his wonderful dialogue with Orson Wells) and lack of patience to get it done with (he does one take for every shoot) and his fondness for women's clothing make him a unique and lovely character, and in Johnny's hands he is brought back to life.
The rest of the cast is also wonderful, and a great deal effort was put into choosing actors as similar as possible to the real people they're portraying. Best of all is of course the wonderful Martin Landau who does fantastic job as horror superstar Bela Lugosi. Jeffery Jones as Criswell, Bill Murray as Bunny Breckinridge, pro-wrestler George `The Animal' Steele as Tor Johnson and Sarah Jessica Parker as Dolores Fuller, as well as all the rest, are terrific. I recommend seeing at least one of Ed Wood's films (preferably `Bride of the Monster' or `Plan 9 from Outer Space') before watching Ed Wood, and that would give you a much better perspective at the film and the characters. In any case Ed Wood is well worth watching if you can get your hands on a VHS copy, and let me know if someone gets the brains to release it on DVD.",1054252800,4,2636,4.634615384615385

This is one of the Top 5 comedies of all time and hands down the best Tim Burton film of all time.  Martin Landau gives one of the best performances in the history of American cinema.  Bela Lugosi was a very challenging role (with his drug addictions...not to mention his Hungarian accent).  Landau pulls off the performance beautifully.  Johnny Depp is his usual brilliant self as the ever-positive but often careless director Edward D. Wood Jr.  Another very pleasant surprise in this film are the two comic villains in the wood production company:  George ""The Animal"" Steele as Swedish wrestler Tor Johnson, and Lisa Marie as Vampira, a 1950's Elvira.  They both add a great deal of charm to this film and they both look stunningly similar to the characters that they play.
Bottom line:  the performances are spectacular, the direction is flawless, and the story is true...you can't make this stuff up.  I like to think of this film as both a comedy of circumstance about Ed Wood, but most of all a tribute to a man who was proud to be ""in pictures.""",1048896000,6,1212,4.509174311926605
644308,4,6303407188,"What better man to tackle a biopic of the legendary worst director of all time Ed Wood than Tim Burton?  Master of the weird and wonderful (see Edward Scissorhands and Beetlejuice) Burton shows a remarkable amount of compassion, relating Burton's career up to the premiere of his fabled worst movie, Plan 9 From Outer Space.  Tracking through his relationships with his girlfriends and aging actor Bela Lugosi, there are equal parts sympathy and wonder at Wood's bizarre life, films and the band of misfits that surround him.
Johnny Depp is obviously at ease with director Burton, even to the extent of playing off Wood's penchant for wearing angora blouses and skirts with  panache.  His earnestness lifts the movie from what could easily have been made something far more depressing given Ed Wood's spectacular failure with regards to his career.  Martin Landau, in an Oscar-winning performance, is very impressive indeed as Bela Lugosi, playing his extreme patheticism and drug addiction in a brave and unflattering light.  The rest of the cast are good also, including the novelty of seeing Sarah Jessica Parker as Wood's girlfriend.  Clearly a versatile actress she should find no problem finding work once TV's Sex And The City has finished.  Juliet Landau (Buffy The Vampire Slayer's Drusilla) puts in a good turn as one of Wood's leading actresses.
Whilst there are parts that drag, Burton's minute attention to detail (which never takes your attention away from the movie itself) makes it seem like you're watching a real 50's movie, especially given the mannered yet somehow realistic performances.  It might not be Burton's most accessible or even most enjoyable picture, but it stands as something of a standout in the genre of the biopic.  It's strange, magnificent, on a grand-scale, in short exactly what how you can imagine Wood wanting his life to be committed to film.",1046304000,3,1886,5.074433656957929

In the 50's, the direcor/producer/actor/writer named Ed Wood made numerous B-movies that starred Bela Lugosi, a swedish wrestler named Tor, his girlfriend, and other friends of his. Maybe it was the lack of funds. Maybe it was the lack of experience. But Ed's movies just weren't good! ""Ed Wood"" is his story. It tells of how Ed (played by Johnny Depp) meets his hero, Bela Lugosi, and is his friend until he dies. It also tells of his struggles to get his movies made. And when they finally are, he ignores the terrible reviews and gets started on the next film. This guy was driven and is really entertaining to watch. If you enjoy this movie, then you should rent some of Ed Wood's real movies!

To begin, it's a well-aclaimed mov here in Portugal and we have some Ed Wood moviegoers (thank god there isn't a lot!)
It's a damn well made mov, created when Burton had finished his personal Batman Returns, this one on the life of Edward Wood Junior, the worst director ever.
Well I never watched a mov from Ed, and to be honnest, I don't intend to spend my money doing so. This mov spare us the torture of it, and Burton uses again his strange sense of humour to tell the story of a guy who was convinced that his movs were excellent. In a way, the message is given by Vincent D'Onofrio in a delicious cameo as Orson Welles- we must go through with things, even if they're bad as Ed's movs.
As Ed, Johny Depp goes quite well, as well as Sarah Jessica Parker as the girlfriend who leaves him, Bill Murray (ultrafunny!), Patricia Arquette (very sweet), Lisa Marie Juliet Landau and Jeffrey Jones as the omnipresent Criswell. But the real surprise is Martin Landau as Bela Lugosi, the  horror star from 30's Dracula. Under his heavy makeup, we really forget we're seeing an actor, he truly looks like Bela! What a performance! Impossible not to sympathise with him, he even won the Oscar (which is quite rare in a Tim Burton mov).

This movie eventually morphs into the infamous and disastrously awful 'Glen Or Glenda?'.  From this point Wood Jr.'s career spirals out of control, taking on a shape and form that he becomes convinced is the height of artistic expression.
We also discover the circle of friends that Wood Jr. continously surrounds himself with were as hopelessly eccentric as he was.  Though Depp is the star of the film - and he makes an indelible impression as Ed Wood - Landau steals the film entirely portraying horror film legend Bela Lugosi.  Alternately belicose, vainglorious, outlandish, profound, mystifying, pathetic, Lugosi finally succumbs to a 20 year drug addiction, deeply affecting Wood Jr.  Shortly afterward the intrepid filmmaker has an encounter with his gullible landlord whom he convinces to finance the movie 'Plan 9 From Outer Space'.  This sequence of the film is perhaps the most memorable because of the diametrically opposite forces involved.  The film's financial backers are members of a Baptist church who object to virtually everything about the production - first politely then vehemently when Wood Jr. emerges from his dressing room after a tantrum wearing the angora sweater and dark colored skirt made famous in 'Glen Or Glenda?'  He flees the production site winding up in a bar where he spots none other than Orson Welles.  Director Burton paints Welles as a victim of  coincidence who innocently tells Wood Jr. that ""visions are important.  Never give up your visions, Ed.""  Does this mean we have Welles to thank for 'Plan 9' and the other Wood Jr. schlock films that followed?
'Ed Wood' also has one of the best supporting casts you will ever see in a Hollywood film.  The bizarre and campy characters are played to great effect, their dialogue being as eminently quotable as Wood Jr. was notorious.  Since it's release in 1994 I cannot think of a movie that has made me laugh as hard and long as this one does.  If you haven't seen 'Ed Wood' stop denying yourself this cinematic treat and correct this oversight immediately!",1036800000,,3070,5.108216432865731

While the characters in the film including Ed Wood himself must have been far more horrible in real life Tim treats them gently in his opus. Ed Wood's reputation as the worst director ever is examined here but the real message is that if you have a dream pursue it no matter what. Though Ed, his career and friends are all lovingly mocked they are given a sense of dignity they were denied in life.",1036627200,,473,4.386363636363637
644346,4,6303407188,"Ed Wood was clearly a somewhat weird man, and this celluloid look at his life is, well, pretty weird.  But it works because, while the movie clearly pokes fun at Wood's utter filmmaking ineptitude, it also manages to portray him in a somewhat sympathetic, almost reverent light.  As portrayed by Johhny Depp, Wood is an eternal optimist, who never gave up pursuing his visions, even in the face of his lack of talent and difficulty finding financial backing for his projects.  Perhaps the most telling line in the film is when Wood is on the phone with a potential backer for ""Glen or Glenda,"" and he says, ""Worst Movie You've Ever Seen?  Well, I promise the next one will be better.""  This was obviously a man who wasn't going to allow a little thing like overwhelming disdain for his work to get him down, and it's hard not to admire such positivity.
For a small-time movie, ""Ed Wood"" was able to attract a pretty accomplished cast, and the performances reflect that.  In the tile role, Depp perfectly captures Wood's hopeless optimism and enthusiasm, wearing a perpetual happy smirk even when uttering lines like ""I like to dress in women's clothing"" (the scene where Ed appears in drag to reveal his fetish to his girlfriend is absolutely hilarious).  Sarah Jessica Parker is also excellent as Ed's girlfriend Dolores, who tries to stand by her man until she concludes that he and his cronies are ""wasting your lives making s**t!,"" as she informs them just before leaving Ed.  The most memorable performance of the movie, though, definitely comes from Martin Landau as Bela Lugosi, a washed-up, morphine-addicted ex-star who bears more than a little bitterness toward Boris Karloff.  Landau does an amazing job of capturing the tragic essence of his character, who was both pathetic and good-hearted as he tried to rebuild his career and regain some semblance of dignity after years away from the limelight.  The scene where the 74-year-old Lugosi has to roll around in a pond at four in the morning, wrestling with a fake octopus that's missing its motor, is both touching and funny at the same time.
The movie, fittingly enough, ends with the making and premiere of Wood's defining movie, the stupendously and brilliantly horrible ""Plan 9 from Outer Space.""  A movie about grave robbers from outer space, ""Plan 9"" is sort of a clinic of bad technique (even the film's backers, a couple of devout Baptists, are able to identify some of Wood's many errors).  Of course it's also the movie made famous for Ed's new girlfriend's chiropractor assuming the dead Lugosi's role by holding a cape over his face.  ""Plan 9"" is almost universally regarded as one of the worst movies ever, and a look at the bizarre life of its creator gives you an idea of just what was going on in his head.",1033776000,,2785,4.765072765072765

644348,5,6303407188,"For those who are fond of Grade Z movies, ED WOOD strikes a remarkably resonant note.  Director Tim Burton daringly takes the life of one of the worst directors of all time and somehow makes it interesting.  The real life Ed Wood was convinced of his own directorial talent and each of his wretched cinematic excesses reflect a highly charged but extraordinarily misplaced energy.  Wood's personal life was not unlike the frenetic scenes that he liked to place in front of the camera.  Wood believed that most people were as quirkily odd as he was.  In fact, his oddness became the norm of his films.  Johnny Depp as Ed Wood is convincing as a man whose cinematic vision was obvious only to himself. When things go wrong with his productions, Depp rolls his eyes in the creepy way that would make Michael Moriarity proud and schemes his way to the next step.  Depp's interpretation of Wood's monomania for getting the scene filmed in one take captures the inner essence of a man whose own life was run on the same basis.  Whatever Wood wanted done was done on the fly.  If Wood had a genius it was not the genius of presenting his own distorted vision on the screen but rather the less obvious but equally necessary talent of letting nothing interrupt his directing.  Burton gets some cheap laughs by focusing on Wood's cross-dressing, but the real humor lies in Woods' ability to get his backers to laugh while he convinces them to bankroll his various film projects.  Depp is surrounded by terrific supporting help.  Martin Landau as Bela Lugosi deservedly won an academy award for supporting actor.  The scene in which Depp and Landau reminisce about Lugosi's previous triumphs on screen are both touching and powerful.  As Landau speaks, he reaches out with his scrawny fingers in a come hither way that eerily brings to mind Lugosi's penchant for attracting his next victim.  Bill Murray and Sarah Jessica Parker are also effective.  Each of the real life screen characters was flawed, in some cases, massively so.  What makes ED WOOD the superb movie that it is, is Burton's own loving penchant for presenting people who can succeed on their own terms, despite a society that seems determined to thwart their every move.",1030406400,2,2226,4.7702349869451695

Not only Burton's best yet, but one of the finest
American films from the 90's -- or of any decade for that matter.
Cleverly written, lovingly directed, stylishly shot, acted
with empathy, scored and designed with tasteful camp, ED WOOD
is a virtual paen to Hollywoodism (whatever the hell THAT is!).
Just Czapsky's cinematography or Shore's soundtrack alone are
worthy of immense praise.  And Tim Burton hits all the right notes flawlessly (for a change). Definitely his Citizen Kane.

I thought it was a big joke when i first started watching Ed Wood.  He had an outgoing personality and he tells someone he wore panties in the war to show someone he knows about transvestites in order to get a job.  I wasn't sure if this was all true, if it was written for screen or if he actually said these things and did them or lied.  The movie making scenes are hillarious, Ed Wood claims that audiences won't care about the little details and only at the big picture.  This philosophy lets him put people that aren't in the scene go in to help someone up or do anything else.  Strings that are easily visible and horrible special effect ofcoarse make all of his films B-movie classics to some people these days.

So today, when I was in the store, I saw a copy there on the shelf, and said ""what the heck, It looks good."" So, as I am writing this review, the film is just finishing and I found it stunning. You do not even have to had previous knowledge of the worst director of all time (Johnny Depp as Edward D. Wood, Jr.) to enjoy the film. Some of Ed Wood's worst (best to his fans) films include ""Glen or Glenda"" and ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"". Johnny Depp gives an exceptional performance as Wood, who after constant disencouragement, does not give up his cause to produce his films. Although it is somewhat of a comedy, it is touching and tender. Although not for all tastes, this film will delight most all who view it.

644395,4,6303407188,"Whatever deficiencies Burton's biopic may have as a film are readily compensated for by a subject matter, script, and style so cinematically evocative that the viewer is apt to sense he's seeing many other films at the same time.  Burton captures the fanaticism in every true movie fan, the sheer exhilaration experienced by the lover of movies of every artistic level, the driven exhuberance and enthusiasm that unite the best directors and their audiences.
The posters in Woods' office--of ""Kane,"" ""Dracula,"" and numerous grade B movies--range from the sublime to the ridiculous, each betraying their owner's undiscriminating passion for films and his compulsive need to complete his projects.  At one point he meets the great Orson Welles (an uncanny impersonation by Vincent D'Onofrio) who, like Wood, is struggling to finance his latest project--""Don Quixote,"" of all things!
""All visions are worth fighting for,"" Welles counsels Wood, who takes the advice to heart.  Sharp enough to know the greatness of ""Kane"" even in the fifties and smart enough to quote Coleridge's definition of imaginative art as ""the willing suspension of disbelief,"" Wood remains oblivious to the fact that his movies are fooling no one--except himself.  He watches them repeatedly and uncritically, mouthing each word of atrocious dialogue, shedding tears of pathos and joy, and always shaking his head in disbelief at the wonder of his own illusions.
It's easy to see why Tim Burton would be drawn to a project such as this, and Burton's own attraction to the surfaces of the medium, to the light and shadow of the projected image, and his eye for the off-beat make him a creative and spiritual descendant of Ed Wood.  And Ed, like every great director from Eisenstein to Burton himself, understands the very essence of cinema.  It's not about the ""reality"" documented by the camera: it's about the creative, imaginative, inventive mixing and matching of strips of celluloid.  Early in the film he makes the claim, ""I could make an entire movie of stock footage.""
Many directors could, and have.  But Ed is represented by Burton as being uncritical and fanatical about his projects to the point of being utterly and fatally careless as well.  He's energetic, relentless, generous, but never exacting.  The ""details"" don't matter, he tells his crew and producers on ""Plan 9 from Outer Space.""  And so his failures, though no less resounding, are at least free of cynicism and are fueled by a vision of cinema in which the viewer's imagination can be counted on to replace verisimilitude.  Wood brings to film-making a kind of free-spirited, carefree vision that disciplined film-makers like Burton know can never succeed with a public insisting that film simulate, and not merely symbolize, reality.
My only reservation about Burton's impressive tribute is the casting of Johnny Depp as Ed Wood.  Depp is a skilled, off-center actor and somewhat of a cult Hollywood figure himself.  But Depp's adolescent voice and youthful appearance almost suggest a star-struck, recent teenager going for broke against all odds--a common, familiar theme throughout our culture.  Wood, on the other hand, was an innocent, enchanted child-creature in a grown man's body.  He's the amateur in us all, including those of us who might fit the description of a middle-aged yuppie in possession of nothing more than a camcorder, an iMac movie editing program, and a dream.",1010966400,2,3433,5.14748201438849
644396,5,6303407188,"Well folks, I thought long and hard on what film to mark my 200th review. I thought of this one. One of my all time favorite movies. Hopefully, it will be yours as well. Director Tim Burton really outdoes himself with this brilliant film about the worst filmmaker ever. Johnny Depp plays Ed Wood, a man so in love with Hollywood and filmmaking, that he doesn't see that he has no talent for it. But, in his own mind, he thought he was really making great cinematic art. He was a cross dresser who was not gay. He had a history of wearing pink angora sweaters. He would even sometimes wear them to work!. Ed Wood's films have become famous because of their horribly incompetent filmmaking. Bad actors, cheap sets and effects, and so on. But Good old Ed, god bless his heart, thought he was making 'Gone With The Wind' every time. Martin Landau is on hand delivering a jaw droppingly brilliant performance of old horror star Bela Lugosi. His performance is incredible. One of the best performances I've ever seen. He deserved ten Oscars instead of one. Bill Murray gives one of his best performances ever as Bunny Breckinridge, an actor of Ed's looking to having a sex change. Patricia Arquette and Sarah Jessica Parker play the women in Ed's life. Landau's own daughter, Juliet Landau, has a part. Burton's girlfriend Lisa Marie plays Vampira. The film was shot in glorious black and white, and it was a brilliant move on Burton's part. It really adds to the feel of the time and the movies Ed made. Depp is great. He is definitley one of the best actors of our generation. His interpretation of Wood is upbeat and hilarious. Even in the bad times, he still shows Ed having a sunny outlook. This is one great film that did not get great box office returns. What a travesty. Some people just don't understand things. I'm telling you right now : this is a great movie to be treasured. A genuine film classic.",1006473600,64,1905,4.540697674418604
644397,5,6303407188,"You may have never heard about the cineast Edward Wood, Jr, but if you love cinema, this film is made for you. More than a cinebiography of the late diretor, the movie is a declaration of love for filmaking itself.
Shoot in magnificent black & white, the plot follows Ed during his 'rise' in Hollywood. Tim Burton is a great moviemaker and in this picture he is as good as he has never been. He does not hides his adimiration for Ed, and what he brings to screen is a passionate story made by someone who loves it.
The cast is nothing but great. Of course, most of the show belongs to Johnny Depp, who deliveries a brilliant perfornance as 'the worst filmmaker ever'. Sarah Jessica Parker and Patricia Arquette are much more than fine as Ed's the love interests. Vincent D'Onofrio is as great as usual surprising everyone playing Orson Welles (In a key scene Burton puts together both the worst and the best director chatting in a bar ). And, Martin Landau is so good as Bela Lugosi that one might think he is 'possessed' by Lugosi himself.
All in all, it is a great film. It's amazing to see Wood's adventures in order to finish - or even start- his pictures. If you like this movie, I also recomend you ""Gods and Monters"", ""RKO 281"" and ""Shadow of the Vampire"". They won't let you down!!!",1006473600,,1290,4.42436974789916

Wood became only the second person to write, direct, produce, and act in his films, blissfully unaware of how inept he was in all four areas. Johnny Depp (is there anything he can't do?) plays Wood to the hilt. I dare you not to laugh when he tries to shake his head yes and no at the same time. Jeffery Jones is also great as Criswell, and is clearly having a lot of fun in the introduction. Bill Murray doesn't really look or sound like John ""Bunny"" Breckinridge, but I actually think he was much better for the role of the Ruler in Plan 9. However, the single greatest performance is by Martin Landau as Bela Lugosi. I had to watch the film twice before it sunk in that he was not the same guy! Overall, just a great film.

Wood Jr. the same way. He was not stupid at all, he simply had no talent. He was nice and positive and happy most of the time, and he enjoyed his movies, he really thought his films were great. He is just the opposite of Orson Welles, who made Citizen Kane, the best American film. Ed Wood made the worst. Martin Landau was EXCELLENT in the role of Bela Lugosi, and his arms were disgusting (because of all the stitches he had) and he won the oscar for best supporting actor, but I thought Johnny Depp gave an AWESOME performance too. It represents the story of Edward D. Wood Jr. the best way we could imagine. The fact that the film was in black and white was another good point too...we were more in the atmosphere of old films. It was funny, smart, and it was not laughing at anyone, even with the main character (the worst director of all time) and that was a good surprise. The kind of film you have to watch over and over again...don't rent it, BUY IT. It is great! Not the best film I've seen, but quite a good piece of entertainment. I was surprised to see Bill Murray in this, who was in my mind a bad actor...but I realized he played in good films and in this one he did a very good job. When I'll see Ed Wood films, I'll remember how he was feeling and how he liked them, and I'm sure I'm gonna like them too, if I watch them with this idea in my head.

644418,4,6303407188,"Ed Wood, Jr. is more beloved than reviled as the ""creative mind"" behind such grade-z movies as ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"", ""Glen or Glenda"". Though it's generally accepted that Wood wasn't playing it straight with his horrible scripts (""he's been killed, murdered....and somebody's responsible!""; ""Future events like these will affect you in the future!""), unbelievable special effects and nonesensical plots, this film slightly suggests that Wood actually bought into his own nonsense. Here, Johnny Depp (is there anything he can't do?) plays the beloved but infamous Ed, a WWII vet, failed movie maker and transvestite. Playing Ed as if doing an extended Jon Lovitz impression (his lines delivered all high-pitched and non-stop), Depp's Ed is mostly innocuous and guiless (his genuine belief in the implausible predictions of self-proclaimed seer, Criswell, are a hoot) and incapable of seeing his own sheer lunacy. The script uses ""Glen"" and ""Plan 9"" as bookends on Ed's checkered career - with the first film marking his collaboration with the then well-faded horror star, Bela Lugosi (Martin Landau), and the second marking a sort of tribute to the star who died before its completion. Director Tim Burton stocks the film with a well-rounded cast - Bill Murray as transvestite ""Bunny"" Breckenridge, Jeff Jones as Criswell, Sarah Jessica Parker as Ed's long suffering girl friend, Dolores, Lisa Marie as ""Vampira"" and George Steele as Tor Johnson - that's a lot of fun, but doesn't do much with them. Bill Murray seems at times the saddest transvestite in history, mulling his paltry earnings from Ed's flicks to pay for his ""procedure"" while Jones' Criswell puts a damper on things when he makes all too clear how he invents his predictions. Instead, Burton's attentions are reserved for Ed and Bela, with Landau turning in a performance that's in turns hysterical (when revealing his hatred for arch-rival Boris Karloff), heartbreaking and terrifying (the forgotten star dies trying to kick a heavy heroin habit). Even so, the script doesn't stay consistent, with the emotional and humours highs isolated in their own scenes. The script reaches a depth of sorrow and horror when revealing Lugosi's profound suffering in de-tox, yet only briefly. (The script dangles the question of how well the dying star recognized the inanity of Woods' work).  In other moments, the film hints at other real-life horrors like Ed's war experiences, but much of the film is actually shy of risk. Much of the conflict is between Ed and his backers - mostly evangelicals conned into thinking they were financing a religious picture and slowly realize Ed's true caliber as a film maker. Ed fights back to preserve his artistic vision without having to prove what his vision is or whether he even has one. His flagging self-confidence is restored by a chance encounter with Orson Welles (Vincent DoNofrio, also an underappreciated Hollywood fixture, his lines dubbed by the same guy who voices ""Brain"" on ""Pinky and the Brain"").  The more famed director is about to start work on a troubled epic of his own which, though never named, will be instantly recognizable to film students as ""A Touch of Evil"" (""Can you imagine Charlton Heston as a Mexican Cop?"", Welles laments). Plunging ahead, the film works to the climax of Ed's career- the infamous ""Plan 9 from Outer Space""! With Ed's trademark horrible special effects, unintelligible plot and insultingly poor script, ""Plan"" is almost guaranteed cult-status. Burton only recreates some of the scenes, so the last few minutes of the film plays like a montage of SNL skits, with Ed almost crying as he savors each frame. Leaving Ed before the credits roll on his ""masterpiece"", we never see Ed's lowly ends, his own substance abuse problems or the more clearly horrible films that marked his latter years. Burton never confronts this and misses an ironic motherlode - whether the ridiculous fantasy of Ed's pictures were supposed to be scary, or whether in seeming scary but so ineptly so, they were actually meant to symbolize a safer world than the one he experienced for real.",994118400,4,4114,5.07533234859675

The actors are great, Martin Landau got an Academy Award for playing the old, sick Bela Lugosi. The movie feels very real and it is a fascinating story.

644423,5,6303407188,"To begin with, I have one thing to say: Why is this film no longer available on VHS, let alone DVD? This film has been regarded by many as Tim Burton's best film. The majority of critics were full of praise, and the film went on to win 2 Academy Awards-one for makeup, and the other one for Martin Landau's grand and touching performance of horror great Bela Lugosi. Ed Wood, the posthumously famous, cross-dressing director of bizarre, laughable, poverty-row budgeted horror and exploitation movies, was given his due in Tim Burton's fractured fairy tale. Wood and his cronies and acquaintances were, for the most part, ""fringies"", those individuals who are marginally involved in show business, or once-greats who had fallen on hard times. The most famous of these individuals was, of course, Bela Lugosi, who, at age seventy, was near-broke, addicted to morphine, and for the most part, out of work. One of the few people willing to give Lugosi a break was Ed Wood. Wood's critics like to paint Wood as an opportunist looking to exploit Lugosi, but the man was there for him. Now, back to the film. The performances are very enthusiastic-the actors and actresses seem to be having a ball with their material-a funny and sad script that is, for the most part, historically accurate. There are no ""composite characters"" here. With such a collection of ""characters"", which includes 400 lb. Swedish wrestler/actor Tor Johnson, wasp-waisted TV horror hostess Vampira, bogus psychic Criswell, and outrageously effeminate ""Bunny"" Breckinridge, who needs to invent characters? The film is shot in a historically correct black-and-white, and the actors, headed by the artistically courageous Johnny Depp, bear an uncanny resemblance to their real-life counterparts (Landau as Lugosi, Lisa Marie as Vampira, George ""The Animal"" Steele as Tor Johnson, Jeffrey Jones as Criswell, in particular) The art direction is dead-on accurate, recreating every last absurd, cheesy detail of Wood's notoriously cheap sets, and the crowning touch is Howard Shore's evocative and eclectic film score. The score incorporates horror-movie cliches, complete with theremin, as well as mambo, bongos, and a wonderful ""hootch"" dance performed by the late, great beturbaned Korla Pandit on the organ. The fact that this wonderful looking and sounding film was not nominated for its score, cinematography or art direction is another mystery. But the biggest mystery is why Disney treated this film like a poor relation, did little to publicize or ballyhoo it, and then removed it from the video market is the greatest mystery of all. If you haven't seen this film, see it-if you can find it! If you already own it, pray for its re-release, preferably on DVD!",978912000,4,2728,5.146396396396397

644495,5,6303407188,"Ed Wood is perhaps the most misunderstood and just plain odd films of Tim's career. It is a comedic look at the life of the man who's become oficially known as the Worst Director Ever, Edward D. Wood jr. We follow Ed from the debut of his play ""the Casual Company"", which although touted for it's realistic costumes (he got them from army surplus, so the story goes) was a horrible bomb. Never being done in by debt, flopish movies or low morale, Ed's love for angora and womens' underwear saw him through many a hard days night. The Casual Company really set the tone for Ed's film career, as he wrote, produced and directed (like some sort of mutated Orson Welles, Ed's idol) several hollywood low-budget bombs. His ""big break"" comes when he meets an aging and heroin addicted Bela Lugosi who he becomes fast friends with. Through many trials and trbulations, Ed somehow finds a way to get his work finished, even by getting a baptist church to fund a film about grave robbing! Sure it meant having all his friends baptised in a swimming pool, but he -did- get it done. Johnny Depp plays Ed Wood to a T, once again transforming himself completly into the role. To watch Depp in Edward Scissorhands, then Ed Wood will really give you a feel for how great an actor he is. Lisa Marie plays the sultry latenight monster movie television show host Vampira, whom Ed pursues to be in his movies for some time before she finally relents (due to her being fired). Martin Landau's protrayal of an aging Lugosi is spellbinding, one of the best of his career. Perhaps it is poetic justice in some way, that Ed Wood is one of Burton's worst grossing films. I'm sure Ed would approve.",970358400,,1672,4.521452145214521
644496,5,6303407188,"It would be embaressingly tempting to make a slapshot film out of the worst director ever lived. But tim Burton didn't settle for that. No,  instead he made a touching and truely genious film about a man who had a  real passion to make movies, although he had the knowledge of your granny.  Of course, this is one of the funniest films of the last decade, but what  makes it truely outstanding are the more serious aspects, such as the  undeniable love to the movie industry. Ok, so a tribute-a-like comedy? 4  stars, max. But what makes me give it the whole pack? Tha acting. This film  is what seems to be a sea full of fishes that simply are giving the best  performances of the whole lives. I mean, just look at the stunning role  that Martin Landau does as Bela Lugosi, or the the sheer realistically  stunning enthusiasm Johnny Depp has managed to put up. And I swear I has to  look twice to make sure it wasn't the rwal Orson Welles in the scene!  So,  what I want you to remember is, that this film is not only great fun, but  also a true masterpiece about friendship, respect and love for movies.  Everyone interseted in movies should see this film instead of all the  sugared tirbutes about the great filmmakers, because even though Ed Wood  didn't have the gifts, he had something that every director should always  have; HEART.",966729600,,1339,4.462809917355372
644497,5,6303407188,"Edward Wood, Jr. is widely considered to be the worst director ever to  work in motion pictures. Anyone who has seen ""Plan 9 from Outer  Space""-regarded as the worst film ever made-or ""Glen or Glenda?"" will  probably agree. It is, therefore, somewhat ironic that Ed Wood's life  should make such a wonderful movie-much better, in fact, then he ever could  have hoped to do.
The story concerns Wood's struggles to get his three  most famous movies made (the two listed above plus ""Bride of the Monster."")  Since he worked somewhere below ""low budget,"" this was not always easy. At  one point, he and his cast get baptized in a swimming pool, a prerequisite  for getting money from a Baptist Church. Nothing was too much for Eddie,  though, to get his pictures made.
Ed Wood was also known for something  other than being a terrible director: he loved to wear women's clothing.  Wood was never happier than when wearing a blond wig, high heels and an  angora sweater...oh, and a moustache, too. When asked if he was a  homosexual, Wood happily replied, ""No! I'm a transvestite!""
That sense of  irrepressible good cheer was Wood's most endearing feature. No matter what  happened to him, good or bad, he always took it with a smile. This included  his movies, as well. Ed never met a take he didn't like. The most  unexpected things could occur in a scene and his response would be the  same: ""It's perfect!""
As good as those aspects of the film are,  though-and they are very good-they aren't what makes ""Ed Wood"" so special.  Seemingly out of nowhere, the most touching part of the film is the  friendship that develops between Wood and decrepit former horror film star,  Bela Lugosi. Lugosi is a drug addict and hasn't worked in years, but to  Wood he's still a star. Ed loves and reveres him. He gives him work in his  movies and tries to take care of him as best he can. Their scenes together  are what make this movie so good.
Throughout his career, director Tim  Burton has consistently made remarkable films on the oddest topics  imaginable. From ""Beetlejuice"" to ""Edward Scissorhands"" and now ""Ed Wood,""  Burton is a filmmaker who takes risks and consistently makes them pay off.  Not only has he made a movie about the worst movie ever made, but he shot  it in black and white! A definite gamble, but he makes it work.
The  acting is uniformly good. Johnny Depp is excellent as Wood, doing maybe his  best work in film so far. As good as he is, though, he is overshadowed by  Martin Landau as Bela Lugosi. Landau gives the performance of a lifetime, a  haunting portrayal of this once great man. Landau's work alone is enough to  recommend ""Ed Wood."" Throw in Vincent D'Onofrio's uncanny cameo as a young  Orson Welles, and you end up with one of the best films of 1994.",960249600,,2777,4.593877551020408
644498,5,6303407188,"This black and white film by Tim Burton is based on the life (well, principally the 50s career) of Edward D. Wood Jr, the sci-fi B-movie purveyor often hailed as the worst director of all time.  The movie isn't  constrained by its roots in reality; Wood's real-life experiences  (transvesitism, a friendship with the aging Bela Lugosi, and a desire to  make some truly awful films) are so outlandish that they need no  embellishment.  But it still comes across as a Tim Burton film - the  picture opens with a slow-motion camera crawl across B-movie country (misty  swamps, underwater monsters, UFO sightings) with the credits inscribed on  graveyard headstones... then Criswell (Jeffrey Jones) rises from his coffin  to deliver an ominous introduction to the story.  Johnny Depp is in  effeminate mode here (a la Sleepy Hollow) but he plays Wood as an eternal  optimist; so much so that it's hard to equate Wood's eventual demise with  Depp's cheery portrayal.  As for Martin Landau - well, I pretty much forgot  it was him at all, he's so convincing as Bela Lugosi!",958953600,4,1067,4.877094972067039

However, the  true star of the show is Martin Landau, who rightfully deserved his win for  Best Supporting Actor for his portrayal of Bela Lugosi.

Martin Landau is superb as the  once-great horror star Bela Lugosi.
Ed Wood always knew he would be  remembered, but probably not in the way he expected. In this film we see  his misfortunes, trials and disappointments, and can't help laughing. Ed  Wood tried to overcome adversity, and mostly failed. Some of the problems  were not of his making,  he needed money to finance his movies and was open  to exploitation by those with their own vision. Or the people around him  were clownish amateurs, not quite understanding what Wood wanted.
