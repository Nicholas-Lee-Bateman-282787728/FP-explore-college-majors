8709712,5,B00VA329YG,"I purchased this to use for my 5th grade science unit on matter. The kids loved it and the lesson plans available to go with it were great. Some of it was a bit complicated for my students, but they enjoyed the science jokes that they caught. Definitely an educational and entertaining way to reinforce concepts about the properties of matter, but introduce the concepts first so they will enjoy the humor.",1454803200,,406,4.652777777777778
