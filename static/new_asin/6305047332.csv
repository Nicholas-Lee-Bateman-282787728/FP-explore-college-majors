953568,4,6305047332,"There's an interview (in English) with MAGNIFICENT WARRIORS star Michelle Yeoh on the 20th Century Fox dvd.  Not having seen the James Bond flick `Tomorrow Never Dies,' or a Hong Kong action flick, I watched this movie unfamiliar with the star or the genre she was working in.  What the heck, though - it's a war movie, so I figured there'd be something familiar to latch onto.  The most welcome thing I heard on the interview was Yeoh's recognition that action is closely related to dance (Yeoh has ballet in her background,) a truth she learned when making this movie. If this is a typical example of Hong Kong action movies it seems she's not the only person in that industry who realizes there's a vital rhythm to be achieved when cutting an action sequence.

 MAGNIFICENT WARRIORS was made in 1987, and Yeoh's character seems modeled on Indiana Jones.  She wears a leather jacket, wields a nasty bull-whip, and hops around China in a canary yellow bi-plane.  Yeoh's character is a soldier of fortune who is hired to travel deep into Mongolia and pluck a local governor with valuable information from the clutches of the evil, occupying Japanese.  Naturally there are bad guys around every corner, impossibly acrobatic and tenacious bad guys, who must be battled into submission.  The action is non-stop, the fight choreography extremely impressive, and the plot sturdily serviceable.  The Japanese want to build a poison gas factory in the region, and in the meantime they're amusing themselves by testing the lethal toxin on defenseless locals.  There are a couple of thousand Japanese troops around the city, impossible odds under normal circumstances, but more or less even odds when Michelle and crew start cracking the whip.  As in the western action flicks I'm familiar with, the day extras break like matchsticks when Michelle's fists (and feet) start flying.  Others - the bad guys with lines of dialogues and names listed in the end credits, are a little - okay, a lot - harder to take down.  They're as tough as shoe leather and resilient as graphite, able to withstand a flurry of physical punishment that would leave a bull water buffalo whimpering for mercy.

Bottom line - MAGNIFICENT WARRIORS is a fun action flick, heavy emphasis on the action, that takes for granted our female heroine will save her comrades without missing a beat or stopping to pat herself on the back.  The core story may not be terribly complex, but it doesn't let you down, either.  Strong recommendation for this one.",1149552000,5,2512,4.872941176470588

953570,5,6305047332,"Magnificent Warriors is a very uneven film, mixing a convoluted story and hit-or-mostly-miss comedy with spectacular action sequences.  Thankfully there is so much action in the movie it easily outweighs the weaknesses in other areas.  It was the follow up to Michelle Yeoh's ROYAL WARRIORS (a superior movie), and showcases her athletic skills and grace to an even higher extent.  The fight choreography is simply some of the best that ever came out of Hong Kong - fast, intricate and brutally real.  The life of a stuntman in 1980's Hong Kong was a very painful one, and the legions of stuntmen that worked on MAGNIFICENT WARRIORS must have received countless injuries to make the stunts and fights so visceral.  Their sacrifice means that the viewer is treated to action that is heart-stopping in its terrible beauty.
You have to be prepared for an incredibly cheesy script and acting, but if you go in for the action then MAGNIFICENT WARRIORS will not disappoint!",1043539200,5,967,4.944444444444445
953571,4,6305047332,"This film turned out to be a surprise for me...I was expecting much less especially with the Indiana Jane look on the dvd cover, but this film delivers...Michelle is a Indiana Jane type character, who teams up with a spy in the middle of WWII, who helps protect a Chinese emperor-like individual against the Japanese...the fighting scenes are what surprised me because I thought it would be more gunplay than anything else...there are a good amount of fight scenes, some of which are pretty brutal and reminincent of royal warriors although not as great...Dont get me wrong tho, some of the scenes will make you cringe and think OUCH!...I'll admit that the last battle scene WAS more gunplay than fighting, but it doesnt take anything away from the film...check Magnificent Warriors out tho, its fun to watch plus there are many humorous scenes...check out michelle's other great stuff too like Yes Madam, Royal Warriors, Wing Chun, CTHD, and Tai Chi Master...hope this was a little helpful...later",1009324800,6,998,5.018072289156627
953572,4,6305047332,"Michele Yeoh stars as a confident, self-reliant bush pilot who is cashing in on the resistence to the Japanese invaders in 1930s China. The plot  really gets going when she is recruited to assist a spy deep within  Japanese held land and ends up becoming embroiled in the resistance efforts  whole-hog.
The film features excellent cinematography, fine performances  by all actors, and well-choreographed martial arts sequences. There were  some silly sound effects related to those fight scenes, but that's to be  expected in an older film like this one.
The only dissapointment I felt  was that I would have liked to see some of the plot and characterzation  touches. (For example, was the drifter related to our heroine or  not?)
All in all, though, this is a very enjoyable flick which I highly  recommend.)",966470400,,810,4.977611940298507
953573,5,6305047332,"One of Michelle Yeoh's early efforts finds her as a bush pilot flying a bi-plane in 1930's China, running guns to the villages opposing Japanese occupation. Yeoh's character is brave and resourceful... and can she ever  kick butt! Very well directed, with awesome martial arts fights, but also  with a great plot and great characters. GET THIS MOVIE!!!",929923200,12,352,5.051724137931035

7881263,4,6305047332,"Michelle Yeoh carried this movie as her performance as a kung-fu warrior was excellent.  This movie is in Cantonese with automatic English subtitles.  The story takes place during World War II, during Japanese occupation of Asia.  This particular town/city seems to be in the Tibetan region.  The Japanese wants to build a plant here to produce a poison gas that can kill people within five minutes.  They need to the town's people to be their workers, so they took control of the city's lore/mayor.  He is well liked by the town's people, but has very little power during the Japanese occupation.  As an informant to the Chinese government, the lore shares about the plan for this dangerous poison gas plant with a Chinese spy known as Sky001, and in exchange the spy is to arrange for a plane to take the lore to China for protection.  Michelle Yeoh's character is sent in as a pilot to help the lore escape and collaborate with the spy.  In doing so, the two also meet a patriotic scammer who helps them along the way, and the three end up leading a fight against the Japanese.  This film includes some humor, great fight scenes and historic context in which the Japanese did use the local leaders to get the locals to do what they were told.  However, this film did not capture enought emotional empathy from the audience.  It's a feel-good somewhat comedic movie.",1508371200,,1368,4.654166666666667

7881269,5,6305047332,"Like all of the 20th Century Fox DVD's in this set, this movie has excellent digitally restored video and sound. As good as the Dragon Dynasty's restored DVD's. Great movie and a lot of fun to watch. Michelle Yeoh is terrific as usual. This is a keeper for me, because it has Michelle Yeoh flying an old classic yellow British Tiger Moth Biplane as her preferred mode of transportation throughout the movie. They used a REAL airplane in the movie. It's in perfect shape, and it's such a joy to see and hear it flies in the air. Such graceful ladies, both the Tiger Moth and Michelle Yeoh! There is even a dogfight scene with a Japanese WWII fighter that is a little bit reminiscent of the Top Gun school where Maverick duked it out with Viper!

Thanks to 20th Century Fox for a great job in restoring this classic, I love it!",1322870400,3,825,4.392156862745098
7881270,2,6305047332,"Wow in this film Michelle Yeoh shows that she is an amazing martial artist!!  The movie itself was just so-so though.  It's about how her character is trying to rescue a city leader (in Mongolia I think) from the Japanese.  It didn't really feel like an adventure, as one might assume from her Indiana Jones-esque character.  Plot was passable - not nearly as gripping as I would have liked, and the pacing left me bored at times.  So despite Michelle Yeoh's awesome fighting and charismatic acting, this movie was just OK.",1318982400,,523,4.7032967032967035
7881271,4,6305047332,"So I've just now made it my life's mission to not let a few weeks elapse without talking up a Michelle Yeoh flick. It's a life's mission... or until I run out of Michelle Yeoh flicks or run out of synonyms for ""beautiful"" and ""fearless"" and ""awesome martial artist"" and ""does her own stunts."" MAGNIFICENT WARRIORS (a.k.a. ""Zhong hua zhan shi."") is from her earlier days, released back in 1987, and it's an uneven period adventure that is ultimately more enjoyable than not. As ever, Michelle Yeoh is in top skull-denting form.

I guess I get the RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK comparison, what with the setting being circa 1938, what with Michelle Yeoh playing a bold adventurer and brandishing that bullwhip, and then there's the wartime backdrop. But Michelle Yeoh's character, Fok Ming-ming, happens to also be a biplane aviatrix in the early 20th century, and so I'm bringing Tom Selleck's HIGH ROAD TO CHINA into the mix... so there. The plot soon catapults Fok Ming-ming thick into danger and intrigue as she's pressed into patriotic service by her uncle and by some high-ranking military Chinese officer. Her mission involves her flying out to Inner Mongolia, to some remote town called Kaal and there rendezvous with China's top operative Sky Number One. Sky Number One and Fok Ming-ming soon bump into a ruthless Japanese general who has developed a lethal poison gas to use against mainland China, with Kaal projected as the future site of the poison gas factory.

Hong Kong cinema has a habit of injecting common denominator comedy into the story line, except that the comedy in MAGNIFICENT WARRIORS is actually a notch above that base level. There are still moments of sheer over-the-top groaners but there are also bits of clever dialogue and situational comedy. Richard Ng's swindler character provides the brunt of comedy relief. He teams up with Fok Ming-ming and Sky Number One to take on the Japanese forces, and when the swindler goes into action, he reminds me a bit of how Bugs Bunny used to do it against Elmer Fudd. Other members of this tiny resistance group consist of the well-meaning but craven governor of Kaal and his kung fu sweetheart.

It's nice that even the side characters partake in the fighty fights. But make no mistake, when not being all sunny and charming, Michelle Yeoh assumes the lion's share of the fighting, and she's remarkable again and, as always, she does her own stunts. Not only does she wield a bullwhip like a pro, but she does crazy stuff with a length of rope. Note that the male lead Tung-Shing Yee (Sky Number One) is heroic and dashing, but he's not quite as intrepid as the former Miss Malaysia. Michelle ends up rescuing him a bunch of times. As if that's not enough of a punch to the ego, maybe he shouldn't have told her that his real name is actually ""Lily Wang.""

This is during an era when wirework wasn't as advanced and so, even as bodies get tossed thru the air with utter disregard for the laws of gravity, well, you can sometimes see the wire. There are several instances when the story screeches to a standstill as folks keep flapping their lips, and I do think that the plane chase dragged on too long. Going down the home stretch, the tone changes perceptively from breezy escapism to serious wartime drama WITH A MESSAGE. That streak of nationalism gets slathered on pretty thick. So it's a good thing that Michelle Yeoh is ""beautiful"" and ""fearless"" and an ""awesome martial artist"" and ""does her own stunts."" Don't need those synonyms yet.

The DVD's bonus stuff offers: an interview with Michelle Yeoh in which she talks about her first film THE OWL VS. BUMBO and of how MAGNIFICENT WARRIORS was the toughest action flick she'd ever made (00:06:57 minutes, in English); an interview with director Tung Wai who offers thoughts on Michelle Yeoh, Jackie Chan, Sammo Hung, and Bruce Lee (00:12:51, with English sub-titles); Production Notes which include a synopsis of MAGNIFICENT WARRIORS, Cast & Crew film credits, and Michelle Yeoh's filmography up to MASKED CRUSADER (a.k.a. SILVER HAWK) in 2004; a Michelle Yeoh biography and a so-so photo gallery of her in this movie; a photo gallery from the film (25 photos); the original theatrical trailer (00:04:00 minutes) and the English-dubbed new trailer (00:02:19), both trailers being fairly spoiler-heavy; and original promotional material (the original Hong Kong movie poster and 12 photo stills).",1279411200,3,4416,4.859229747675963
