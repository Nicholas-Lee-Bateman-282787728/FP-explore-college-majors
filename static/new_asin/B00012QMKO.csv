1969476,2,B00012QMKO,"I am not as forgiving as the previous reviewer who, while upset that the 'Chicago' parody is excluded from the disc, can easily overlook it.
It was bad enough that ""The First Cut is the Deepest"" was removed from all video releases of 'The Last Shout,"" and nearly unforgivable that this box set loses the Debbie Harry vocals from the theme song (replaced by an instrumental version) but to lose the SINGLE best moment of the fifth series, and one of the highlights of the ENTIRE run is just beyond the pale!!!!!
I cannot fault Warner Home Video, who merely distributes BBC product in Region 1, but I wonder why the BBC has such difficulty with ""music rights"" issues.  Considering the amount of money that French and Saunders fans have spent on their products over the years, I do not accept that the BBC can't afford to clear these issues prior to (inevitable) video releases.
It galls me that the horribly presented Oxygen versions are more complete than the dvd but, we consumers are just the folks who hand over our money.....we don't really matter.
On the plus side, the dvd series is otherwise flawless.",1079481600,11,1107,4.676923076923077
1969477,4,B00012QMKO,"The packaging and the discs themselves list the aspect ratio as 4:3 (standard) but fortunately they are actually 16:9 (anamorphic widescreen), which is great because that's how they were originally shot and aired in the UK. For some reason these episodes were cropped to 4:3 when they aired in Canada (maybe the U.S. as well) and they looked awful, with characters sloppily chopped off the sides of the frame in some shots. Now you can see everything you missed!",1079481600,,462,4.860759493670886
1969478,5,B00012QMKO,"Ab Fab is back on track !  After watching this new series 5 you could almost say that series 4 was weak and almost hesitant with it's story lines and writing....Series 5 is fast, sharp, and more evil than ever  in the history of the show....(Includes the Christmas special)......To my horror when opening the DVD, i saw the aspect ratio of 4:3.....almost in tears I decided to check the DVD in the player  first.......after comparing the picture to my taped VHS from BBC London ....this DVD DOES SEEM TO BE IN WIDESCREEN....!!!!",1079395200,5,528,4.717391304347826
1969479,5,B00012QMKO,"The girls are at it again and they are funnier than ever before. These girls are like a fine bottle of wine as they grow better with age. Make that a few bottles Darling. You can't get enough of the AbFab girls and having the entire collection of AbFab is a must have in your Britcom library!!!! I give this rating of 5 stars, but truly these girls deserve much more!!!! It is so Fabulous Sweetie Darling!!!! Cheers!!!!",1078358400,6,419,4.384615384615385
1969480,4,B00012QMKO,"Ab Fab is benefiting from its fame by being able to now draw such talented people as Kristen Scott Thomas and Minnie Driver. Thomas is amazingly funny as a spa-hopping travel writer who comes by for a ""book"" club. Minnie Driver visits as herself and, in great good humor, depicts herself as a greedy star eagerly looking for freebies. One of the Spice girls features (I don't remember her name - sorry) and claims a connection because she went to school with Saffy. That episode, and the Elton John episode were rather weak. A welcome addition to the cast is Felix Dexter, who plays Saffron's baby daddy John Johnson. One would wonder how Saff winds up with such a strapping lad by her side (""When I see her, I think 'intimate relations to the max'""), until he opens his mouth and you realize he is one of the nerdiest men on Earth. All of the old favorite characters appear, Saff's dad, Bo and Marshall, Jackie, Gran, Bubble, Kathy Grin, and so on. (The only one missing is Oliver and we don't see Dawn French, s'far as I can tell - boo hoo).
I only gave it 4 stars, because it just seems to lack the edge that the first two seasons had. Still, if you enjoyed Ab Fab, here's more Ab Fab!",1078099200,6,1188,4.3558558558558556
1969481,4,B00012QMKO,"One of the most original and hilarious sitcoms to come our way within the last ten years, the fifth season of Absolutely Fabulous proves that there's still fresh life of the two divas.  While the fifth season will probably boast a continuity of big name guest stars following the post fourth Season, ""Gay"" with Elton John and Minnie Driver and Baby Spice (Emma Bunton), what makes this show precious are the total fads Edina latches onto for further success, beauty, or whatever (always doomed to backfire), Patsy's new femme dictator role running her pal Jeremy's shop (yet still has lots of vulnerability as the less liked), and Saffy's new coming to terms of becoming a mother herself, whose righteousness seems to work against her as she finds herself pregnant.  Also much welcomed are Marshall and Bo whose schemes for fame to be with Hollywood celebrities have totally fallen to the absurd (adoption/""baby-napping"" services for celebrities?  Fake Fat Infomercials?), and in the meantime Bubble's just as airhead-like as ever, and yet somehow she has become the Shakespearean Fool, who may in fact ""not be completely useless.""  (Jan Harooks' most funny moment, however, must be as Katy Grin providing a news report from Kuwait of the Iraq conflict in the season opener.  Watch for it!)
Of course, the slapstick and very cleverly scriped put downs are in fact quite fresh, and unlike Season 4 where similar references to the first three seasons seemed totally rehashed (with the exception of Saffy's play episode), any similarities here seem to be more fresh.  Much kudos to Saunders who may have heard criticism that the show has come of age, and yet with this season proves it can still has quite a bit of its luster.  Are the shows as say slapstick and as classic/vintage Ab-Fab as earlier seasons' ""Hospital"" or ""Poor""?  Maybe not.  But this season proves that this show still has quite a bit of energy and Jeniffer Saunders still has lots of creativity and fresh ideas.",1078012800,5,1978,4.915915915915916
1969482,4,B00012QMKO,"Saw the series on the BBC while studying in Britain.  While devoted AbFabers will appreciate the humor here, some of the jokes have lost their appeal.  Saffie gets pregnant by an aid worker while on a humanitarian mission in Iraq and Patsy has left the magazine business to work at Jeremey's -- a London Bond Street shop.  Still, with many guest stars such as Minnie Driver and Elton John this a worthwhile purchase if you want to keep-up with the happenings of Patsy and Edina.",1075507200,12,478,4.6

1969594,5,B00012QMKO,"This is the best season of Ab Fab in my opinion. I actually saw this season before the others and this one stands out in terms of humor, acting and pop culture. I loved Emma Bunton as herself and Bubble was funnier than ever. You cant go wrong with so many talented actresses thrown into the mix. Mo Gaffney is brilliant as Bo and I loved her in the episode Birthin'. Ab Fab ended with a bang and I loved this season above all the others.",1269302400,,438,4.104651162790698
1969595,4,B00012QMKO,"Truly one of the best seasons where the characters are fully fleshed out. Saffy finally makes it to adulthood and drops a neutron bomb on Edina (which has an inverse hilarity effect.) Admittedly Patsy is getting a little long in the tooth finally but man oh man she can still deliver the lines like nobodies business. Always funny. Always irreverent. Always worth it.

1969596,5,B00012QMKO,"Edina and Patsy are back in ""Absolutely Fabulous"" season 5 which would mark the show's final season as of 2009. This year contains eight glorious epsiodes all written, like others, by Jennifer Saunders who plays Edina. The highlight this year is when Saffy becomes a mother and makes Eddie a grandmother! Another great bonus to season five are the guest stars who popped up including Kristin Scott Thomas, Minni Driver, and the one and only Sir Elton John. The funniest episode in this set is called ""Cold Turrkey"" which has the girls celebrating the Holidays with Patsy passing out and going to the hospital with the chance she might die. Patsy's sister from season one, played by the talented Kate O'Mara, reprises her role. There are also 15 minutes of outtakes and a photo gallery. The girls have been back to TV in a few specials, but Jennifer Saunders has stated that she is not interested in bringing the show back as a full series.",1260230400,2,939,4.696969696969697
1969597,4,B00012QMKO,"Edie and Patsy are just as shallow and hilarious as they were in 1-3.  Saffie is still as angry as she was in 4, though, which I thought was a change from how her character started.  Overall, series 5 is well worth it.  I wasn't disappointed.",1254441600,2,242,4.217391304347826
1969598,5,B00012QMKO,Series 5 draws a great conclusion to a fabulous series.  The comedy stylings still remain fresh and there are subtle and clever references for long time fans of this series and of the French and Saunders duo. We found this well worth the watch.,1213315200,,244,4.545454545454546
1969599,3,B00012QMKO,"As as series-long fan of the AbFab girls, I bought this last DVD in great anticipation. However, it was a bit disappointing. Not as funny as the rest.

For the longtime fans, like me, there are lots of inside jokes (picking up on things that happened in previous programs). It's always fun to go back and relive the old situations - but might be a bit confusing to those who come to AbFab through this series. Best to start at the beginning to get the full effect.

I liked the last three episodes - where Saffy has her baby and the episodes following it - the best. John, the father of Saffy's baby, really made me laugh, especially in his dealings with Saffy's parents. And, I will always love Bo. God Bless Mo Gaffney! Finally, these last three episodes made me realize truly how nightmarish Edina was as a mother.

I agree with the other reviewer about the crazy BBC intro that you can't get around. I have found this on other BBC DVD's as well - and I'll tell you, it doesn't give a warm and fuzzy feeling. Certainly doesn't make ME want to go out and buy more. However, this isn't the forum to complain about that - next e-mail: to the BBC.com site! Join me there if you agree....no more mandatory intros!",1188864000,4,1211,4.373333333333333
1969600,5,B00012QMKO,"If you have a sense for the world of hip couture fashion, this very best of Brit-coms will keep you laughing 'til tears come to your eyes. It revolves around a manic fashion agency owner, Edina, and her over-the-hill, ex-supermodel, anything-goes girlfriend, Patsy. Edina has a straight-laced daughter, Saffron, whom she enjoys mentally tormenting, and a straight-laced mother, who in turn constantly needles Eddi. The hilarity is VERY faced-paced, the jokes non-stop (as are the pot-smoking, boozing and man-eating of Patsy and Eddi). And Eddi's off-the-wall, hair-brained Scottish secretary is icing on the comedy cake. This is not-to-be-passed-up, non-stop hilarity, as only the Brits can do!",1185926400,,695,5.566037735849057

I had just as much fun watching this series despite others who say different, so get it and be the judge for yourself.

""Cleanin'"" - With Saffy gone on a long-overdue holiday, Patsy (Joanna Lumley) and Eddy (Jennifer Saunders) have the house to themselves, though curiously it isn't everything they imagined it would be. Eddy has moved her PR business into her living-room, with several high-profile new clients on the books including Emma Bunton. Suddenly Saffy returns..with an announcement that will send Eddy's world into a tailspin.

""Book Clubbin'"" - Eddy and Patsy's little book club meets to discuss their latest selection, an abridged mini version of 'The Picture of Dorian Gray', though Mariella Frostrup fails to bring her celebrity pals. Meanwhile Saffy (Julia Sawalha) invites her boyfriend around to break the big news.

""Panickin'"" - Eddy installs a panic room, whilst Patsy tries to get chummy with Minnie Driver. Real panic ensues when a lockdown occurs leaving Eddy and Patsy trapped in the high-tech fortress, leaving Minnie in the 'capable' hands of Bubble (Jane Horrocks).

""Huntin' Shootin' Fishin'"" - Eddy is doing some Royal PR so she and Pats decide to travel down to the country to see how the other half live. Saffy holds her baby shower with Emma Bunton and her ever-bizarre old school friend Sarah (aka 'Titty KaKa')

""Birthin'"" - Saffy has gone into labour, ruining Patsy's expensive outfit when her water breaks. Marshall (Christopher Ryan) and Bo (Mo Gaffney) stop by for another strange interlude, whilst Katy Grin (Jane Horrocks) has been cast as Roxie Hart in 'Chicago'.

""Schmoozin'"" - The lost Beatle tapes have been found, and Eddy's in love again, this time with an old school flame. Patsy's old sex films get released by a Japanese company including 'Boobarella'.

""Exploitin'"" - Patsy has signed up baby Jane (or Lola) with an infant modelling agency, and a job has come up for a Jean Paul Gautier photo shoot at the zoo. The only problem is getting around Saffy...

""Cold Turkey"" - Christmas has come again, and this time Eddy's staying home with the family. Patsy, in a moment of sheer rage, finally lets Eddy have it before mysteriously passing out. In the hospital, Patsy is told she is dying. Her wayward sister Jackie (Kate O'Mara) comes to visit, but does she have a more sinister motive? Is this really the end for Pats....?

1969627,5,B00012QMKO,"ABFAB as some of us fans call it is quite possibly one of the zaniest, craziest, sickest shows to come out of Britain to date. The premise is simple. There's Edwina (Eddie), her friend Patsy and Eddie's daughter Saffron (Saffi). Eddie is an overweight, immature, compulsive, undersexed, selfish, fashion misfit who worships LaCroix and everything he designs. Patsy is a drunken, non-working, oversexed, chain smoking, spend thrift, fashionista, self-centered, alcoholic, leach. She's also Eddie's best friend. Saffi is the plain jane, level headed, smart, prudish, straight laced dauther of Eddie and her father who happens to be gay has left her mother for a gay black man.

Poor Saffi even though the child of the house more often than not has to be the adult of the house. She fixes her mom breakfast when she comes in from a hard night of boozing and partying with Patsy. Patsy and Saffi hate each other and continually snipe at each other.

Aside from storylines, ABFAB is very difficult to describe because many of the funniest bits are visual. You have to see and hear everything. One funny episode has Saffi off to college for the first time. Eddie tries to guilt her into staying home but it doesn't work. That morning Eddie drives to the college and barges her way into Saffi's class with a can of something and a can opener and asks Saffi to open the can for her because she doesn't know how to work the can opener. Madness. It's very funny.

You should watch all of the episodes because there's not a bit of sanity in any of them. You've got to have this!

Not suitable for young children though. It's barely suitable for grown ups!",1132185600,8,1644,4.697916666666667
1969628,3,B00012QMKO,"Ok, the episodes are primarily great.

The extras on the DVD are funny too...

BUT!

The BBC version is cut down  for the American DVD. I HATE that!

There is this whole hillarious scene in Birthin' with Bo, Marshall, and Katy Grin in Chicago singing the music...well sort of...in a dream sequence...TOTALLY CUT

Although, the end of Birthin is completely hillarious and I hope Bo and Marshall have to face Eddie and Saffy again in the future. OMG...""Bo, Where's the face""! LOL!

Likewise, There are some short word changes in the begining of birthin cut, definitely cause they just didn't want to pay to leave them in!

Also, there is a scene somewhere with Bubble singing the begining of Circle of Life From Lion king...I don't even remember where this is, but I cant find it. It just cracked me up the first time I saw it. Hopefully it is on something I just don't own, but I saw on TV.",1127865600,8,889,4.478260869565218

This is the first season of the show that I purchased b/c it was the only one I could find @ most stores.  Only seeing the earlier episodes made it a little harder to figure out where it fit in, but that didn't stop me from laughing.

This season has all the ladies getting older and a little more humane, all though there is still plenty of room for some Boli and a joint.  I feel like there is more depth added to the characters, which is essential to keep the viewers interested.

1969658,3,B00012QMKO,"BBC video has always charged too much for AbFab on DVD, but now they add insult to injury by adding a promo for BBC that seems about ten minutes long -- AND YOU CAN'T STOP IT FROM RUNNING EVERY TIME YOU PUT THE DISK IN YOUR PLAYER!

You can't skip the promo, can't fast-forward it, can't access the disk menu till it's finally done.  I have never owned a DVD that forced advertising on paying customers in such a rude, nasty way.  This promo must have been one of Eddy's great PR idea.

If anyone knows how to skip this endless promo, please tell me!  It makes me never want to watch or buy from BBC again.",1119657600,11,606,4.145299145299146
1969659,5,B00012QMKO,"Sweetie darling! They are back!!! After the not so funny season 4, I am so thankful that Season 5 has regained its touch. It is so much more in line with the humor of the first 3 seasons and the excesses are once again there- from the Hummer borrowed from Jeremy's, to Gucci of babies... Season 5 is an absolutely must buy in any fabulous fan's collection.",1106265600,3,356,4.3283582089552235
1969660,5,B00012QMKO,"It was discouraging to read disparaging remarks here on Amazon concerning censored segments in the 5th season DVD collection of ""Absolutely Fabulous"", because I noticed a rude editing job during what was apparently a missing ""Chicago"" parody, and Deborah Harry is credited with singing the theme song which, here, is an instrumental. Strange, because I sort of liked the organ blues melancholy sound of the new instrumental theme until I realised it was in lieu of Deborah Harry's vocals. I don't like watching the show on the Oxygen cable network because there is a lack of respect for the program with crass, indiscriminate commercial interruption and an inferior video quality. So it seems it is only a matter of cost saving that these segments are missing, and it is ironic that a show which so boldly mocks greed in capitalism would find itself victimized by it. Even that though, can't stop me from singing the praises of Jennifer Saunders, creator, star and writer of the series. ""Absolutly Fabulous"" still stands alone in the American television wasteland as sharp social satire that manages to retain that essential element of the best sitcoms - a heart. In our cardboard cut-out, eternally politically dull sitcom saturated TV, it is a sigh of relief to find comfort, warmth, and familiarity in an alcoholic, a drug addict, insincere Christian born-agains, and the like of a more real modern life. And the program always looks so good, with bold colors, elaborate sets, and constant movement like a gentle heart beating frantically. At near the end of this collection, I was very worried that a beloved character had actually expired. That I could care about any fictional character on TV as deeply as I did watching this, is testement to the fine craft of this program. But first and foremost, this show is just so (darn) funny.",1104624000,6,1839,4.935483870967742
1969661,5,B00012QMKO,"I spent all day Christmas laughing my arse off!  Eds and Pats are at it again and truly funnier than before.  Earlier reviewers have been less kind and I think too critical.  It's best to watch AbFab with a group.  You'll then see how some people get the jokes and others do not.  Maybe the earlier reviewers just didn't 'get' all the jokes.  I think I did though!  Season 5 is sooo good I'm buying it today!  Go get it and save it for a day when you feel clinically depressed.  Pop it in the player and voila! Instant healing via Edina & Patsy... Laughter, it's the best medicine!",1104105600,5,581,4.256880733944954
1969662,4,B00012QMKO,"Ok i'm not going to bother you with the technical aspects of this DVD because several reviewers have already done a fantastic job of describing the episodes. Season 5 of ABFAB is great! Now I will agree that it is a far cry from the shows from Season 1-3, but still it is great! With a show that has gone on for five seasons it isn't just a issue of comedy anymore.  People that have followed the show for years are expected to have actually grown to care about the characters, so there isn't quite the need to try so hard to get laughs.  Don't get me wrong, Season 5 is hysterical.  Everything from Saphie's prgency, to Eddy becoming the grandmother from hell, and Patsy being jealous the entire time.  It's all gold, and if your a fan of the series you will love to see how all of this maddness unfolds. Granted your not going to laugh quite as much as you used to, but AbFab still maintains to be funnier than most of the comedies that we have currently on tv in the US.

So if your a fan of the show this is definatly a essential purchase!",1100908800,3,1043,4.195
1969663,3,B00012QMKO,"I have been watching ""Absolutely Fabulous"" for quite a while now and when I first watched series five, I rather enjoyed it. But, after looking back at series one through four, it isn't quite up to par. The other shows were very inventive, you literally never knew what the characters were going to do or say next. But, this series has started to recycle some of the old jokes and also creating new storylines that aren't as entertaining as others. Probably the worst thing about this DVD is that Warner Brothers produced it. Most episodes have quite a bit of material missing or the scenes are in different order. The main point of depression involving these ""lost"" scenes is a very enjoyable Chicago-Parody. But I quess us Americans will just have to cope with it. Don't get me wrong, I nearly die every time I hear Bo's voice and I always have fits of laughter during certain scenes, but if you are comparing, this would really be a three out of five star DVD. Which leads me to the DVD itself. After I heard the very intertaing commentary on series four, I could hardly wait to hear the new one for series five. However, even though most websites said there was one, there is no commentary. Some sites still say that there is one! Although that's not a big problem it would have added to the special features. For the series one through three complete DVD thers was an entire disc of goodies, and series four was jam-packed as well. But series five, only includes a photo gallery and long but enjoyable outtakes. Note: The photo gallery, for me at least, seems greatly improved. On the other series, it was in slideshow format which got very very tiresome but this new one you can scroll through with total ease!

 On another note, the fifth series has been released in the UK, so if you really want to see the deleted scenes, you could buy a region two dvd player, find some European money, and have the DVD shipped from Europe. It's worth it, for some people!",1097971200,4,1964,4.514044943820225
1969664,5,B00012QMKO,"I was very surprised by series 5.  I ended up catching loose re-runs on the Oxygen channel.  And once I saw this set, I had to snatch it up!!  Now, in my opinion i love all the Ab Fab episodes.  Series 1 through 3 were classic.  Series 4 was good, fresh, and unique.  And Series 5 is a combo of the all the past series.  Here is a breif episode guide:

CLEANIN'-  Saffy has gone away to college and is finally coming back home.  Like always, Edina and Patsy have trashed the place.  But with the help of Baby Spice (Emma Bunton), can the girls get the house ready in time for Saffy's coming, and surprise?!  Awesome start!!

BOOK CLUBIN'-  Edina has started a book club.  And Saffy gets a visit from a mid-wife.

PANICKIN'-  A halarious episode.  Edina is a little paranoid and decides to get a panic room.  Patsy gets a visit from Minie Driver.  See what laughs and troubles ensue in this great episode.

HUNTIN' SHOOTIN' FISHIN'-  Edina and Patsy decide to take country style.  A root'n toot'n fun episode with horses, ghost brids, baby showers, and a ""Spice stalker.""

BIRTHIN'-  Yep, Saffy's due.  See what happens when a lot of old characters come back just for the experience!

SCHMOOZIN'-  Edina and an old lover have rekindled.  Some lost Beatles tapes have been discovered. Well, not for long! :)

EXPLOITIN'-  Edina and Patsy decide to take the Chanel of all babies out to the zoo...er uh...fashion shoot.  See what happens when Mother Saffy finds out!!!

COLD TURKEY-  A bonus episode that was originally a tv special, is included as episode 8.  Its Christmas time at the Monsoon house.  And this year, Edina is staying!  A wonderful ending to a wonderful series.

ENJOY!  HAVE FUN!!",1096156800,7,1694,4.575757575757576
1969665,2,B00012QMKO,"I'll never forget the first time I saw 'Absolutely Fabulous'. I was 15 years old and Series 2 was re-running on BBC One. It was the episode 'Death' and from the second Eddie's recurring oddball Jamaican Nurse bandaged her for her mud wrap to the close with Patsy falling into an open grave, I laughed deepr and harder than I had in a very, very long time.
Sticking with the buzz, I treated myself to Series One on VHS - excellent - and was duly rewarded by Series 4 after a very lacklustre Series 3. Inbetween, the almighty 'Last Shout' tided me over, and thanks to those interminable re-runs, even Series 3 grew on me after a while.
Which brings me full-circle to this, the complete series 5.
Now, oddly enough, this isn't available here in Region 2 on DVD just yet, so I am prepared to put up with minor (yet completely unforgivable in terms of necessity) flaws like the absence of Debbie Harry's vocal on the opening credits, and the lack of the 'Chicago' scene from the 'Birthin' episode (I did catch that one on TV, and believe me, American buddies, you're missing nothing. In vulgar parlance - it SUCKED), but what I was not prepared for in the slightest is the total lack of laughter, smiles and general Humour that made the first four series such a wonderful thing to watch.
For every decent, solid joke (Bubble's New Duchess persona, Patsy's recurring collagen disasters, Eddie singing Christmas Carols) there are three or four totally humour-free incidents (Eddy and Patsy worrying Saffy about post-pregnancy womanhood, preditable and tired Liza & David jokes, Bo and Marshall's infomercial, all appearances by TitiCaca, the entire 'Huntin', Shootin', Fishin' episode, etc etc etc). Laugh-For-Laugh, it's not great, and a feeble second even to the rushed, gimmicky 'Gay' TV Special.
One reviewer here levels a criticism at the studio lighting, and he/she is completely, 100% correct on this score - the harsh, high-contrast key-lighting ratio makes for a cheap and tawdry-looking Monsoon household, and, rather than looking like their fabulous selves, Eddy and Patsy now look like scary old has-beens. Even at DVD quality it's difficult to see detail sometimes, and the whole visual quality is very amateurish - NOT the Thing, sweetie.
Worryingly, Sauders seems to be taking parts of her writing into a 'Surreal' and decidedly less funny area - what works for Britcoms like 'The League of Gentlemen' and 'The Fast Show' most certainly does not work with Eddy and Patsy - case in point, the opening 1940's sequence of 'Huntin', Shootin', Fishin', the Patsy voodoo doll and the 'Boobarella' skits, while solid surreal comedy ideas, are not well-suited to a show where the whole raison d'etre is to keep one's finger on the pulse.
For all the bad points, however, there are some classic moments - Katy Grin and the Tank, 'Big Mother', ""Is he from a-Gabon?"", and Patsy & the pheasant - but these moments of true Ab Fab glory are few and far between, and I, for one, can't force a smile for that length of time while waiting for them to appear.
DVD-wise all is good, the outakes are plentiful (if bog-standard, most outtakes from everything seem to be people getting the same line wrong ad nauseam) and the presentation and audio are top-notch.
Sadly I cannot recommend this DVD to anyone but the most avid of Ab Fab completists. It's rare that I consider an Amazon purchase a waste of $40, but there it is.
Not Good.",1089590400,18,3422,4.782094594594595
1969666,5,B00012QMKO,"Season five is *happenin'* babe!  With that 2-3 year break, Jennifer Saunders gets these characters back to where she intended-- a comedy with unsympathetic characters.  As usual, a tremedous cast of regulars, with some really *fun* guest appearances!!  Jane Horrocks really cuts loose with both her Bubbles and Katy Grin.  Julia Sahwala is very good at the martyered daughter and new mom.  Jennifer and Joanna are excellent-- both in the physical humour and etc.
Yes, it isn't 'nice' comedy (perhaps Jennifer & Ade have moved Richie and Eddie (Bottom) up several social rungs and made them women?), but it is wickedly funny, and good escapism.  This is definitely not for a younger crowd.",1087776000,5,689,5.053097345132743
1969674,5,B00012QMKO,"ABSOLUTELY FABULOUS returns for a fifth series of unbridled fun and hilarity, with 8 superb new episodes.  Join Eddy and Patsy as they sink even lower into the abyss...
""Cleanin'"" - With Saffy gone on a long-overdue holiday, Patsy and Eddy have the house to themselves, though curiously it isn't everything they imagined it would be.  Eddy has moved her PR business into her living-room, with several high-profile new clients on the books including Emma Bunton.  Suddenly Saffy returns..with an announcement that will send Eddy's world into a tailspin.
""Book Clubbin'"" - Eddy and Patsy's little book club meets to discuss their latest selection, an abridged  mini version of 'The Picture of Dorian Gray', though Mariella Frostrup fails to bring her celebrity pals.  Meanwhile Saffy invites her boyfriend around to break the big news.
""Panickin'"" - Eddy installs a panic room, whilst Patsy tries to get chummy with Minnie Driver.  Real panic ensues when a lockdown occurs leaving Eddy and Patsy trapped in the high-tech fortress, leaving Minnie in the 'capable' hands of Bubble.
""Huntin' Shootin' Fishin'"" - Eddy is doing some Royal PR so she and Pats decide to travel down to the country to see how the other half live.  Saffy holds her baby shower with Emma Bunton and her ever-bizarre old school friend Sarah (aka 'Titty KaKa')
""Birthin'"" - Saffy has gone into labour, ruining Patsy's expensive outfit when her water breaks.  Marshall and Bo stop by for another strange interlude, whilst Katy Grin has been cast as Roxie Hart in 'Chicago'.
""Schmoozin'"" - The lost Beatle tapes have been found, and Eddy's in love again, this time with an old school flame.  Patsy's old sex films get released by a Japanese company including 'Boobarella'.
""Exploitin'"" - Patsy has signed up baby Jane (or Lola) with an infant modelling agency, and a job has come up for a Jean Paul Gautier photo shoot at the zoo.  The only problem is getting around Saffy...
""Cold Turkey"" - Christmas has come again, and this time Eddy's staying home with the family.  Patsy, in a moment of sheer rage, finally lets Eddy have it before mysteriously passing out.  In the hospital, Patsy is told she is dying.  Her wayward sister Jackie comes to visit, but does she have a more sinister motive?  Is this really the end for Pats....?
AB FAB finally raises the bar after the lacklustre Series 4.  Once again Jennifer Saunders has given us a hilarious, laughter-filled ride.  Longtime fans rejoice:  Series 5 is one to treasure!
Starring Jennifer Saunders, Joanna Lumley, Julia Sawalha, Jane Horrocks and June Whitfield.  Guest starring Kate O'Mara as Jackie, Elton John, Clarissa Dickson Wright, Kristen Scott Thomas, Mariella Frostrup, Emma Bunton, Minnie Driver, Jean Paul Gautier and Naoko Mori as Sarah.

This series (5)  was terrible.  The show should have ended with series 4.  Series 4 was still Ab Fab, this series is just ab fab pushed beyond it's character limits.  The characters have become stale, and Jennifer Saunders has replaced lack of script with Celebrities.  This show is still my favorite, but series 1-4 only.  I was so dissapointed..some shows should stop while they are ahead.  It really saddens me..so be warned, do not expect the ""real"" ab fab from earlier series.",1081123200,9,624,4.609090909090909
1969677,3,B00012QMKO,"Let me say right off the bat that Series 4 was not that bad. Actually, on repeated viewings it improved a bit. Which is what I truly hope happens here on Series 5, because believe it or not, I think 4 was better. This time around the jokes are few and far-between and some episodes just fall flat. I am referring to the entire first disc. Premises that seemed ripe for comedy gold (Edina gets trapped in her own panic room; Edina and Pats head to the country for shooting and socializing) just don't deliver. The laughs aren't there, and when they are, it's mostly from Jennifer Saunders herself. Joanna Lumley has practically  nothing to do; her character has become completely defanged. I was actually apprehensive about putting in disc two, but thankfully the episodes do get better. Once Saffy has her baby things pick up a bit, culminating in a cheerful, if not particulary funny, Christmas finale. The whole packaging is quite attractive and the episodes are in widescreen (ignore what it says on the back cover), but it's not enough. Sadly, I don't think Jennifer Saunders will ever top the first three seasons. So in conclusion, if you are a die hard fan, you'll cut this Series some slack, but others would do well to just avoid it altogether.",1080777600,8,1252,4.665158371040724

I was disappointed that ""Wheels On Fire"" was instrumental in series 5. It's a great song and could have been done in a Junior Vasquez version by Bette Midler or Joan Jett.  I am just thankful that Jennifer Saunders keeps AB FAB going.  The woman is just brilliant.  The things that come out of that mind!  I hope there are many more series to come.  Nothing makes me laugh as hard.  Jennifer Saunder's Edina just blows me away.  Her mannerisms, her facial expressions, her impatience with people.  I could be in the worst mood, down and out, depressed; I pop in AB FAB and it instantly cheers me up. It almost works just as well as an antidepressant!

I think the departure of Dawn French may have contributed to this season's weaknesses.  Even Season 4 was showing signs of wear, but Season 5 will hopefully be the last.

I am wondering if Oprah's 'Oxygen' affiliation with the BBC on this series resulted in the packaging not being as good as all previous four seasons, which were produced in association with 'Comedy Central'.
