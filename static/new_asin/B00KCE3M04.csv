I WOULD HAVE LOVED TO HAVE SEEN HIM LIVE IN CONCERT, I CAN ONLY DREAM WHAT A SHOW HE WOULD HAVE PUT ON. IF YOU'RE A REEVE'S FAN, THIS IS FOR YOU. ENJOY",1428624000,5,277,3.7758620689655173

To watch Jim Reeves, in sparkling clarity, from the days of the Cowboy suits and less than stellar toupees, to the elegant Jim, in Tuxedo and 'Hollywood good looks', is a treasure to any die hard fan, or just casual listener.
In all honesty, I bought the original release, and wondered if it was worth the cost for an additional 5 songs...Boy, I could KICK myself for waiting so long to get this version!!!! Not only are there additional videos, but the picture and sound quality are so much improved. The addition of the overdubbed versions of ""I'll Fly Away"" and the most recent overdub of ""Distant Drums"" (which is so beautiful, it literally chokes me up) just rounds this DVD out perfectly.
Don't hesitate!! Purchase this DVD!! If you appreciate classy, well produced material, this DVD will be a keeper for years and years to come!!",1415404800,4,959,4.614035087719298
8657602,5,B00KCE3M04,"This video was a dream-come true for me to see Jim perform on stage LIVE.  A fabulous DVD which charts his progress from humble beginnings to the greatest musician he became before his untimely death in July 1964. It was also a good mix of his songs which he sung and recorded during the early and later years.  Loved the great  footage of  past  TV appearances, including the session from studio 'B' , and the performances on the T. Cutrer show.

The sound quality and the clarity of the pictures was immaculate and clear. The take away for me was the wonderful concert at Oslo.

If there was ever a person on this planet that has kept Jim's legacy alive  - it's Larry Jordan.  He deserves  commendation not only  for giving us the best bio of the country music star, chronicling his day-to-day-life, but also for all the other endeavors he has taken thru the years.  Some of these include the multitudinous CDs which he tastefully overdubbed with new musical backings bringing the richness of Jim's  baritone crystal clear as never before, resulting in some great, wonderful Jim Reeves music.

I say - another wonderful VM release by Larry Jordan and the team  - a must add to your collection.",1404345600,8,1195,4.623809523809523
