2649478,5,B000I0QNNU,"Again, if you haven't seen this series that used to air on Channel 10 PBS here in Oregon you've missed the boat.  It was a very clever way to introduce kids to classic stories using a dog who filled in the role as the hero each week while the actual storyline paralleled what the writers wanted to emphasize that week.  My daughter grew up with Wishbone and I was pleasantly surprised to see a few of the shows had made it to DVD.  I can't wait for the rest of them -- I'll be first in line to complete my collection!",1294012800,8,517,4.099009900990099
