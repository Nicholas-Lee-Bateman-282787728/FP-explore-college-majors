5104397,5,B007PXYWBI,"I was blown away by Parker Posey's acting in this dark comedy - she was amazing as the psycho sister. Overall the film was very entertaining and you never knew what was coming next.  Anyone who remembers the Kennedy's in the White House can relate to Parker who assumes the persona of ""Jackie O"".",1370822400,,296,4.481481481481482
5104398,5,B007PXYWBI,"This movie is one of the 90's classics for me - Parker Posey nails the camp factor, and Tori Spelling does a great job playing normal in a cast full of nutty characters!",1364774400,,169,4.151515151515151
5104399,5,B007PXYWBI,"this is a dark and quirky little film, which probably isn't for everyone, but i think it's very well done.  i'm not normally a fan of parker posey, but this is one of the few films in which i really like her (Best in Show would be the other).  Tori Spelling has gotten a lot of criticism in her career, but i think she does a good job as well (as she also does in Trick).  Genevive Bujold is a bit of an odd choice for the mother, but within the context of the film it works.",1361491200,,475,3.8762886597938144
5104400,5,B007PXYWBI,"This is the movie that introduced me to Parker Posey.  It's probably not for everyone, but it has a wicked sense of humor.  I don't want to give away too much about the plot, because, if you don't know anything going into the movie, it's doubly shocking/disturbingly hilarious.  This is definitely a dark comedy--the laughs are uncomfortable ones for the most part, but there is much to laugh at.  The screenplay is adapted from a stage play, and at times the filming retains some of that ""stagey"" feel to it--the dialogue can feel like clever theater dialogue rather than naturalistic film dialogue--but it is intelligent and witty, and there are some stand-out performances.  Tori Spelling and Freddie Prinze Jr. turn in decent performances considering they are not known for being the most dynamic actors.  They are relegated to supporting roles.  Genevieve Bujold as the mother is truly quirky and adds a wonderful touch to the entire proceeding, but Parker is the centerpiece and star.  As Jackie O--a girl living in the past, forever dressed as Jackie Kennedy like she was on one fateful Halloween in her childhood--she alternates between manic and psychotic with that edgy darkness that probably only Parker and a very few other actresses can still make likeable and funny.  This movie was the root of my obsession with her, and I have watched almost every movie she has ever made as a result.",1355270400,6,1400,4.898305084745763

8520800,5,B007PXYWBI,"The script is amazing it's a dark comedy with a twist of taboo, and a taste of tragic... It's about a brother( josh hamiton as marty) who brings home his sweet heart for his family to meet (tori spelling as lesly ) but his twin sister is mentally challenged (parker posey as jackie o) , they had a sexual encounter with each other when they were 14 yrs old while watching the JFK assination on tv.

I recommened it, it's funny and dark from the beging to the end it's now in my collection.",1385510400,2,762,4.366197183098592
8520801,3,B007PXYWBI,"The House of Yes is a 1997 American film starring Parker Posey, Josh Hamilton, Genevive Bujold, Freddie Prinze, Jr. and Tori Spelling. The movie is based on the play of the same name. It received a Sundance Award and favorable reviews.

""The Queen of Indies"" [Independent Films], Parker Posey, delivers her lines with the all campy greatness of Jacqueline Kennedy or Katharine Hepburn. This is Parker at her finest except for her great ingenue in Party Girl.

Tori Spelling became one of the nominees for a 1997 Razzie Award for Worst New Star.

On Thanksgiving Day, 1983, Marty Pascal (Josh Hamilton) brings his fiance, Lesly (Tori Spelling), home to his family's Virginia estate to meet them.

Marty's family prepares for his arrival and for an impending hurricane. Marty's twin sister Jacqueline (Parker Posey), recently released from a psychiatric hospital, is ecstatic about his arrival, until she is informed that a ""friend"" is accompanying Marty. She becomes distressed and shows an inability to cope with change.

Referred to as ""Jackie-O"" by her family, Jackie has had a long obsession with the former first lady and the Kennedy assassination. As an adult, Jackie-O still emulates the former first lady.

Jackie-O lives with her mother and younger brother Anthony (Freddie Prinze, Jr.). He and the matriarch of the family, Mrs. Pascal (Genevive Bujold) are very protective of Jackie.

Meanwhile, it is clear that Marty is in love with Lesly's ""normalcy"" ass a way to break from his family. Jackie interrogates Lesly about her love life with Marty, asking for graphic details about their sexual escapades.

Jackie-O coerces Marty into playing their favorite ""game"" of re-enactmenting the JFK assassination. Lesly walks in and, horrified, runs to Anthony, who previously tried to warn her of Marty and Jackie's relationship, convinces Lesly that he is an insecure virgin dying of a brain tumor, leading to an awkward encounter.",1382572800,,1934,5.176282051282051
8520802,4,B007PXYWBI,"As many have noted, adapting a play to film can be a tricky business. This is one of the better outings.

Here's the scoop. A rich family, sans dad, lives on the east coast next to a Kennedy mansion. Sister Jackie O ( Parker Posey) is obsessed with the real Jackie O and the JFK assassination. She's unbalanced. When her twin brother arrives home, with a fiance, she pops a cork. Unfortunately her mom and brother have little better hold on reality the she so the going gets rough.

This is of the absurdest vein of playwriting and is replete with goofy, clever dialogue. It's fun to take in even when you know the writing is for its own sake. The situation is way out there and, when a certain note in the relationship between the twins is revealed, an uncomfortable note enters the proceedings. The characters are good overall. The mom (Genevieve Boujold) might be the source for the craziness in the family, but she's crazy like a fox and manipulates everyone around her. Brother Marty (Josh Hamilton), on the outside, seems the most sane and is trying to keep it that way by marrying a near wallflower of a girl (Tori Spelling). But even he gets drawn back into the web once he hits home. Brother Anthony (Freddie Prinze Jr.) is probably the least believable of the lot. He's somewhere between dumb and nuts but doesn't quite fit in either space. They all dance madly around the situation. Jackie O' just loves her brother and doesn't want to let him go. She's the star here. I like Parker Posey and she grabs onto this role and shakes it like a dog with a stuffed toy. She alone is worth the price of admission.

The acting is good overall. They didn't quite get the ""stage"" feeling away from it. It's all shot on a very few sets. One particular plot point with Prinze and Spelling just didn't work. It seemed it was there to move the plot in a particular direction, but this is still a good time. It's always a pleasure to see the English language used in such a fun and clever fashion.

If you're at all predisposed to this sort of thing, this should fill your time well.",1382572800,,2078,4.4319371727748695
8520803,2,B007PXYWBI,"The white cover art version is the one with Parker Posey's voice over at the end... an element of the film that makes the whole film better.  Buy the white box version while you can, even if it can only be found used. Take it from one who knows.

Beware the new blue box art version - it does away with the monologue in favor of a generic scream.  The video quality of the blue box version also suffers when compared to the original white box.

FYI, the Netflix version also includes the silly scream.  Boo!",1381276800,15,507,4.239583333333333
8520804,1,B007PXYWBI,"This movie is not even a dark comedy. It is about incest and the damage it can do to a family. The acting is stiff, Parker Posey is not endearing, cute or sympathetic. The movie is about a young man (Josh Hamilton) who brings his fianc&eacute;e home (Tori Spelling) to meet his family during a hurricane. The family live near the ""Kennedys"" with whom they are obsessed. During the storm you find out -- the twin sister (Posey) called ""Jackie O"" has: been having an incestuous affair with her brother (Hamilton), and previously shot the same brother when he left the family to go to New York. Their mother shot the father and buried him in the back yard and that the second brother(Freddie Prinze Jr.)who has dropped out of college is a pathological liar. Prinze and Spelling have sex, in a bizarre scene after Spelling witnesses the twins (Posey and Hamilton)having sex downstairs, dressed as the ""dead Kennedys"".  Posey parades around in the pink suit Jackie Kennedy wore in Dallas. She leers and ""over acts"" and in my opinion totally insults the real Jackie O.  The whole mess of a movie implodes together when the twin, once again murders her brother during a bizarre game where they imitate the Kennedy assassination. This movie is sickening, the behavior is perverted and abnormal and I fail to see how anyone could find this enlightening or entertaining. It is not even a decent quirky comedy.",1377216000,2,1399,4.753086419753086
8520805,5,B007PXYWBI,"The little woman  is at her best and most quirky here.
The rest of the cast is terrific too. Genevieve Bujold is a very ""odd"" mother keeping (well not so much) a rather dark secret.
Josh Hamilton is her overwhelmed twin brother. Tori Spelling can say  'I love you ' in sign language, and Freddie Prinze, Jr. is the inexperienced younger brother.
What unfolds is a black comedy the likes in. which nothing is sacred including the JFK assassination. Mark Waters directs.
This and ""Party Girl"" are my 2 fave Posey films.",1372118400,,517,4.608695652173913
