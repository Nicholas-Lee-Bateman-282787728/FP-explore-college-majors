7962616,4,B000067D6N,"First of all this DVD is three movies for the price of one.  I've seen ""Evil Knievel"" alone list for $20!  ""Evil Knievel"" was better than I thought it would be featuring George Hamilton and was actually quite funny.  ""C.C. & Company"" starred Joe Namath and Anne Margret.  Joe did and decent job acting and Anne Margret did a good job of being naked!  ""Angels Hard as they Come"" starred Gary Busey and Scott Glenn.  Scott was the best actor in the movie and I can see why he went on to become a star.

Essentially you have three cheesy biker movies that capture the essence of the early '70's.  I just bought them to add to my biker movie collection but for the price they were well worth it!",1100131200,17,691,4.2615384615384615
