2472138,1,B000CRYWQY,I ordered this DVD the week after Christmas from Amazon and still have not received it yet - just got a email today from Amazon stating it will be delayed until at least March 20 - I wish when you order it would flash something up stating it is not available until such date - I love the fact I order something that is not available and find out after the fact. Not the first time they have done this - so I wish I could enjoy this DVD but I can't seem to get it to me. I guess it would be worth it to spend the extra money that to have wait forever to get it.,1171497600,,560,3.7542372881355934
2472139,5,B000CRYWQY,"Craig Shoemaker..what can I say, crazy, funny...just plain nuts......DVD quality...not so good...the picture was a little grainy and the sound fell out a few times, but other than that if you want to laugh until your face hurts...get this dvd.",1168473600,,243,5.1

2472141,5,B000CRYWQY,"Craig is one of the funniest comics that I have ever seen.  He has one the funniest standup routines, that I have ever seen.  I guess that is why he was voted comedian of the year.",1109721600,,180,3.9722222222222223
2472142,5,B000CRYWQY,"This is one of the best comedy acts I've every seen - and I've seen it at least 8 times and I still buckle over laughing.  Craig has his routine down, he interacts with the audience, and just keeps it coming.  You won't regret buying this.  Everyone I have shown it to laughs just as hard.  It's GREAT!",1108684800,7,302,4.155172413793103

8101355,5,B000CRYWQY,one of the funniest comedians ever. also loved machine gun act:-) his performance kept our group laughing. good act to see live,1376784000,,127,4.818181818181818
8101356,5,B000CRYWQY,"I've heard Mr. Shoemaker on satellite radio a lot so I had to see him, and I am not dissapointed. The funn iest bit is ""The Lovemaster"". Nice price and good condition from where it came from.",1368748800,,191,4.1891891891891895
8101357,5,B000CRYWQY,"I love this video, i must have bought at least 6 of them for gifts as well.  I have also seen Craig in person and he is hilarious.  I love the ""LOVEMASTER""!!!",1262908800,2,158,3.90625
8101358,1,B000CRYWQY,"I am sure there are those who will find Craig funny. To me, he's just one more comedian that is crude and uses foul language on stage to cover their lack of ability to be funny but clean too.  For those that say, Well, turn it off if it offends you....  I did just that after about 8 minutes. Check out Brian Regan if you want to hear a professional comedian.",1178928000,,359,4.042253521126761
