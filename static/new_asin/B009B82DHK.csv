8539182,5,B009B82DHK,"I bought this video a couple of days ago.  Watched it the first night to acclimate to the choreography, sequencing etc.  I was excited to do the video.  I have been sick for a while now and didn't think I could complete the choreography.  I was wrong. I had a great time; made it all the way through some songs and look forward to just popping it in, not for exercise, perse, but just as a quick dance fix.  Here's the reason it is soooo good.  This instructor, Ms. Graham is truly exceptional, professional, authentic and just seriously excellent as a teacher.  I came here looking for more products by her.  Buy this video; you will not regret it.  This instructor makes it doable and fun.  That is the mark of a superior instructor and an exceptional product.",1358035200,11,762,4.456521739130435
