2213012,1,B0007ICRF6,"The ""Miracle Pictures"" DVD of this film is absolutely without doubt the most execrable presentation of a film that I have ever seen.  I've been collecting movies since the 1970s, when ""home video"" meant 8mm and 16mm film, and I guess I own something like 600 videos--everything from D. W. Griffith to Edward D. Wood, Jr.--and this is the first, absolutely the first time I have ever stopped a movie five minutes into its run time, pulled it out of the machine, and thrown it into the trash.  The ""interactive menus"" promised on the cover don't exist, and the only way you can escape the irritating narration and the endlessly repetitive, themeless, and pointless ""modern"" score is to mute your TV monitor.  Then, however, you can't know what's happening in the story, because the film print from which this travesty was mastered is so awful and so badly framed that the titles can't be read.  Larry Semon's ""Wizard of Oz"" is by any standard a badly conceived and badly executed film, of interest only to film historians really, but it deserves a better presentation than this.  ""Miracle Pictures,"" whoever they are, should be tarred and feathered.",1123891200,8,1147,4.831632653061225

2213055,1,B0007ICRF6,I only gave this movie 1 star because you don't have the option of leaving 0 stars!

2213057,1,B0007ICRF6,"It was horrible. I know this was 1925, but it had little to nothing to do with the original story. It's like the producers of this movie decided to make their own interpretation. I could even get past the fact that it was a silent film if it wasn't for the awful story. There wasn't too much magic in this land of Oz at all. It may as well have been written as a regular love story. Yes, a love story, plus a big secret about Dorothy that wasn't supposed to be revealed, or so they said! That's not what the book was about at all! I won't spoil it, but I will say that's it's not even worth watching. The ending is stupid (it might even have you saying, ""WTF?"", and it seems like the story was written with no thought at all.

No doubt they thought that it would be a good idea to have someone read aloud the text but they were wrong.

2213208,3,B0007ICRF6,"Why would they do this to a lovely silent film?  They erased the original score, which I assume was at one time lovely.  Whatever it may have sounded like, it would have most certainly gone more along with this enchanting piece of silent film history better than the plink plink plunking electronic nonsense that repeats itself over and over and over until you just can't take it any more.  Then there's the narrator ... a speaking narrator for a ""Silent"" Film.  I could hardly believe it myself and I thought surely it's just an opening narration and would end, but no ... it went on and on.  A monotone female who sounds as if she is being forced to read in front of a class or something.  It was all so annoying I ended up turning off the sound all together.

The film was delightful as silent films go, and watching a young Oliver Hardy portray the Tin Man was a real treat!  Larry Semon, as the Scarecrow (and a farm worker), was, as always a delight to watch with his many many faces so popular in silent films.

This old silent version is quite different from the more popular later version.  This one has sword fights, a very cranky uncle, a lot of racial jabs, cannons and a wedding!  This version also includes an introduction to Wikked, who is an Ambassador, Prime Minister Kruel (the ruler of Oz), and a mysterious Phantom of the Basket.  They pack a lot in this adorable 93 minute jewel, and even though it's annoying to listen to, it's a fun watch for silent film buffs.",1460073600,4,1484,4.415441176470588

2213225,4,B0007ICRF6,"Great stunts/effects/faces of Larry Semon/movements of Spencer Bell make this movie.
This is a different story from the 1939 movie as has been said.  I just read the book so am open to other versions, such as the original Dorothy had silver slippers and blue checked dress, not red for the later movie.  To watch this, I at first was surprised at the music, but missed the typical silent movie pipe organ/ragtime and decided to played silently with other movie soundtrack music in the background.  The timing of that worked very well.  One thing about silent movies is they are an event, so I reviewed this for the good and the bad.  This movie right off is a history lesson about racial stereo types and I have seen clips used as examples in documentaries.  What this movie also has worth watching are animation with live action effects, some pretty impressive storm special effects, such as lightening chasing Spencer Bell up into the sky, a plane crashing into a tower, bees swarming after Larry Semon, and people falling from and jumping across towers or hanging from rope ladder of biplane.  Start the movie at 15 minutes and skip the boring beginning and get past the watermelon scene at min14.  The good parts start at minute 15 with the entrance of Larry Semon as farmhand/Scarecrow.  He starts off with great vaudeville comedy, great understandable faces, and his crush on fickle Dorothea who plays him against Oliver Hardy (Tin Man) is worth seeing and sets up and carries most of the story.  Frank Alexander as Uncle Henry starts off trying to keep Dodo from dream world and tries to protect her, but kind of turns out to be a bad guy along with jealous Tin Man, whose motivation initially is wanting to marry Dodo.  I kind of like the plot because it plays off that the Wiz is a fake and so the characters when they all arrive from the farm by storm in incredible special effects for the time, they hide themselves as the various characters when the Wiz is ordered to make them disappear.  The rest of the story is about how Dodo finds her true heritage and the motivations behind betrayal of Larry Semon (Scarecrow) and Spencer Bell (Cowardly Lion).  When Spencer Bell was given a lion suit to hide among the lions, I went, this is getting bad, but some of the best stunts come up with him and Scarecrow with live lions and then Spencer Bell's body movements in the stunts that follow that also involve shaking and tumbling down a hill. Actors did their own stunts in those days. Larry Semon's facial expressions and acting really carried the story as he was the best with facial expressions reminiscent of vaudeville that clearly conveyed his crush on Dodo, and his humor in hiding as the Scarecrow.  He also did a lot of stunts on towers.  Dodo hung from ropes high up.  There is one great quote at min 53:  Scarecrow: ""Change what?""  Wiz: ""Shhh, I'm just a fake.  I couldn't change a quarter.""  There was also some slapstick titles that ref'ed the size of Frank Alexander (Uncle Henry) as Prince of Whales and Laurel Hardy as Something of the Garter.  Is Oz in England?

Start the film and the album at the exact same time. I read some of the one star reviews about this flick that stated the soundtrack was terrible. So I had the idea. I'd heard of it being done with the other version of The Wizard of Oz with Judy Garland. Which I haven't done. But I think it is a perfect match for this film. Of course you have to start the album over after it has played through the first time(If you start the replay of the sound track about 48:43 on the movie it works out well) The timing also matches perfectly for an intermission of cold teriyaki from our date earlier.,1438905600,9,739,4.138888888888889

2213262,1,B0007ICRF6,"Other than borrowing the names of some characters, this story has virtually nothing in common with Baum's book. I find this surprising, considering Baum's son is credited as one of the writers. In this version, Uncle Henry is cruel and abusive, the farmhands are lazy bums, Dorothy is a fickle airhead, the wizard is marginalized to an extreme, and the wicked witch has been traded for an evil prime minister. The film is really all about Semon's run-of-the-mill slapstick, which is so dragged out, it gets boring.

I agree with the reviewers who disliked the soundtrack. The repetitive electronic muzak just doesn't fit a silent film. I also found the narration annoying. On card after card, the reader put the emphasis on the wrong words.

Bottom line... this is a pretty awful movie.",1418601600,3,786,4.902255639097745

I really don't want to give this one any stars, but 1 is as low as the review will allow.
I'm sure the film would have been just fine, or at least more tolerable if the trippy music had stayed more true to what would have been heard behind a silent movie, and entirely cut out the creepy narration.",1415145600,5,530,4.155339805825243

It can be best enjoyed as a document of a time and place... America between the world wars... and how very early media tried its best to amuse the public.  I found it interesting, and worth the time to watch.  Because of its length, this film was likely the main movie in a showing, but the showing also had shorter films, animations, and news; so even though a viewer might be disappointed with this film, there were certainly other things in the showing worth talking about on the walk home.",1406419200,,646,4.551724137931035

Not only does it not fit the film in any way, shape or form...it is ENDLESS! With the exception of a very brief piano piece, the same 10 or 15 bars plays over and over again like Chinese water torture.
Thus, this charming piece of cinematic history is all but ruined by the decision of the distributor to slap a completely inane music soundtrack over the picture.
There are literally hundres of public domain recorded pieces that would have serve the picture so much better and would have cost little or next to nothing to use instead of the musical mess offered here.
Do your self a favor, turn off the sound and simply play a selection of favorite classical piece while you watch...no matter what you select, it will be a huge improvement.",1404000000,2,918,4.708074534161491

Semon was famous for one and two reelers in the silent days, and he is reasonably funny in the bits he brings to the film, even though they are irrelevant to the story.",1402790400,3,472,4.303370786516854

2213319,2,B0007ICRF6,"I picked this movie because it looked lonely out there in Amazon Instant Watch land and it was.... well, not really worth it.  Generally I try to keep my reviews balanced but I can't really do that.  I'm just going to spew bullet points.

* This one is old enough that it's the old black and white, silent, flickering barely-there video.  Delightful!

* The music, which is generally piano music in this era, has been replaced by some sort of vague electronica.  I don't know for SURE but I cannot imagine this is contemporary.  It repeats endlessly for about the first ten minutes, then it goes to piano in the middle of a scene and then back to the same repeating electronica.  It's almost as if they've lost some of the original audio?

* There's a narrator... she reads the cards, often incorrectly in this rather chipper feminine voice that doesn't really match the tone of the movie.

* Oliver Hardy (you know, of Laurel and Hardy) is in here as the Tin Man (woodsman).  He's almost recognizable.

* Quite a few racist bits; the one that stands out is a young African American boy sitting in a watermelon patch eating an entire quarter of a watermelon.

* Surprisingly slapstick.  This one has very little to do with the plot as we know it.  You know the sort of stuff I'm talking about: a guy gets kicked in the rear by a mule, he flies impossibly high into the air and lands in a cactus patch.  (I'm not making this up, actual scene from the movie).

In summary, if not for the music and narrator I would have considered this a grand example of the silent cinema.  My mind is utterly boggled.",1389657600,17,1600,4.421232876712328

First, get this straight: Laurel & Hardy NEVER MADE a version of Wizard of Oz. Oliver Hardy played the Tin Woodsman in a 1925 silent version of ""The Wizard of Oz"" that starred comedian Larry Semon as the Scarecrow (pictured on the dvd cover)... and I think a lot of people have mistaken him for Stan Laurel. Laurel & Hardy were not even officially a team yet, when the silent ""Wizard of Oz"" was made. This was filmed 12 years BEFORE the MGM technicolor version that everyone knows and has seen on TV. Anyone who buys this dvd and expects Judy Garland, and ""Somewhere Over The Rainbow"" is in for a surprise. All you people who've seen it on TV... do you recall seing LAUREL & HARDY in it? No!

However, sometimes a movie can be so bad it ends up being good. Larry Semon's adaption is a fine example. Although, just a montage of silent screen gags with ""Oz flavoring"", there is plenty to laugh both with and at this film. It's fun to see Oliver Hardy in his ""pre-Laurel"" days as the tinman too. Though Semon's adaptation of The Wizard of Oz is a must for any serious Oz collector, children will pass on it to thrill over and over agian to the MGM classic.",1155254400,4,597,4.146551724137931
2213328,1,B0007ICRF6,"This is the WORST ""Wizard of Oz"" adaption ever! For starters to play devils advocate, I can give Baum a break. At this point Wizard of Oz the book, was already a lil bit over 25 years old. As an artist myself I could safely say that something I did 25 years ago, I'd have no problem letting my son re-write to try and re-invent it. Too bad his child screwed it up big time! He co-wrote it with the director, and totally butcherd the entire story and stuck tons of slap stick in there to make it more Charlie Chaplin-ish! The story was thrown out the window totaly and the only thing that remained was the characters (and even they weren't intact and butchered quite well).

The dvd sucks major ass too! The original organ pipe score wasn't secured, and so we're left with what sounds like 5 college kids in a room trying to make music on their labtops. Also they added in a narrator to read the title cards, THE POINT OF A SILENT FILM IS NO TALKING, IF THERE WAS SUPPOSED TO BE TALKING WE WOULDN'T HAVE THE DAMN TITLE CARDS THERE IN THE FIRST PLACE!

If you want to see a true gold Wizard of oz, check out ""The Majestic Scarecrow of Oz"", directed by Baum himself 9 years before this. The only intrest one could take in this dvd is either a film historian (and if I was you, I'd wait for a better version to come out) or to watch this movie to actually see how bad it is (It could be the Ed Wood flick of silent films)",1127779200,7,1417,4.130434782608695
8047554,2,B0007ICRF6,"This was a difficult movie to watch as it took many days and a little bit at a time.  Yes, the dubbed music is annoying and the female narrator that is dubbed in was monotone, and I'm sure none of that was in the original movie.  This was a 1925 silent film and I'm sure no one narrated the text back then and the music score was probably played by live musicians at a local theatre.  However, this movie is quite amazing for its period as the special effects were quite good for the early days of movie-making.  This story is totally different than the famous colored Wizard of Oz that most of us are familiar with, which is Dorothy ended up in Oz and the story starts there where she wants to go home to Kansas.  In this movie, Dorothy is actually a Princess of a far away place.  When she was born, she was left as a baby with an unknown farm family to prevent any one from killing her before she is grown enough to be Queen.  On this farm, she is taken care of by an aunt and uncle who are not her real aunt and uncle.  The uncle is really mean to her.  A local boy, however, is in love with her and he seems to be a main character in this movie, and later becomes scarecrow for a short period of time.  The uncle becomes a lion for a short period of time, and so forth.  The first half of the movie is super boring as it's just all the characters doing dumb acts while on the farm.  It's not until the latter half of the movie does the house gets blown to Oz after Dorothy turns 18 and is ready for the throne.  The person who is temporarily controlling the royal court wants to keep Dorothy away, so that he can remain in power.  However, when Dorothy arrives, the wizard there and her admirer Scarecrow helps her get her throne back while the uncle helps the bad guy stay in power.  Unlike the more modern Wizard of Oz, only the scarecrow and the wizard is on the side of Dorothy, and there are no witches involved.  She's not trying to get back home to her farmland in Kansas as Oz is her home and she is to be crowned the Queen.  This movie is boring by today's standards, but I'm sure in the 1920s when this film was produced and released, it was marvelous.  It's probably why they remade it to the new colored version that we all love and are familiar with these days.",1499904000,2,2279,4.117647058823529
