So I gave this one to my daughter. I loved the first one.",1264291200,,139,3.8275862068965516
2789865,5,B000O5B4I8,"At last the Littlest Hobo is back in circulation. I remember watching these programs when I was a kid, and did not think they existed anymore really. They were probably not the most popular programs around,but I remember watching them on Friday night with great enthusiasm. It brings back great memories of when I watched these with my brother and friends, and of my first dog,Pal. Being in black and white only adds to the mystique. A really great DVD, of a simpler time, when we were all younger,[had more hair] and it took less to entertain us. Highly recommended, and hopefully more issues will be releases soon.",1205625600,8,616,4.712962962962963

8182898,5,B000O5B4I8,More episodes from the Littlest Hobo series about this hobo dog and travels from town to town on the railroad helping and assisting others in their time of needs. Great entertainment for the youngsters or young at heart.,1366156800,,220,4.815789473684211
8182899,3,B000O5B4I8,"I'm 33 and remember The Littlest Hobo from when I was a kid. I don't remember any of these. They look a lot older and the thyme song isn't the same as what I know: ""Maybe tomorrow you'll want to settle down. Until tomorrow I'll just keep moving on"". Happy I didn't pay a lot for this.",1357084800,,284,4.0
8182900,5,B000O5B4I8,Loved the series gave my mum this series and she cried she said it brought back a lot of memory,1354579200,,95,3.8
8182901,4,B000O5B4I8,"Vol 1 and 2 in the RED Cover art are exactly the same as the one DVD with the Blue Cover Art.  Nobody mentions that, and like me, orders them all.  Either buy Vol 1 and 2 with RED Cover Art on the box, or get the one box with the Blue Cover Art. The episodes within are the same.",1341532800,3,279,3.6333333333333333
8182902,1,B000O5B4I8,"This certainly isn't what I expected, firstly I was led tro believe based on the product information that this was digitally re-mastered and in colour - Its' black and white.

 I also thought that this was the later revived TV edition series run on CTV from October 11, 1979 to March 7, 1985 featuring the ""Maybe Tomorrow"" song sung by Terry Bush - No its not.

Audio is poor visual quality not good and overall very disappointing. would not recommend this product.",1336521600,,465,4.646341463414634
8182903,5,B000O5B4I8,"Other viewers wrote that this disc contains the same shows as Volume 1, but if you own Volume 1 with the RED cover, the shows are different. Great show from the old days. Interesting story lines keep one in suspense throughout the shows. Good clean entertainment. I love these shows! Episode 5 stars Ellen Corby (Grandma Walton of The Waltons) and episode 6 stars Henry Gibson (Laugh In). Something amusing you may not notice right off, but there was one scene where Henry Gibson knocks over a dress rack in a store and when they set it back up, I realized the ""dress rack"" was actually an IV pole, a prop probably borrowed from a medical show.",1281312000,5,644,4.512820512820513
8182904,1,B000O5B4I8,"Dont waste you money, if you have vol. 1 you have the shows. Vol. 2 is just a copy of a few of the shows on Vol. 1",1265328000,,114,3.107142857142857
