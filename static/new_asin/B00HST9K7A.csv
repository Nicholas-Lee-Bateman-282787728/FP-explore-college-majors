The live action is acted with excellent. the animated portions is extremely well done. I have both the American version at 117 minutes, as well as the Asian version at a 142 minutes.
 I won't give you a synopsis of the story you can read it above.  But I will say definitely worth having as part of your Anime collection. and if possible go for the longer version.",1429401600,,486,4.21505376344086
