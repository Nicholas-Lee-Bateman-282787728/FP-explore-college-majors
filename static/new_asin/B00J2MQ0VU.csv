Spoilers

DISC. 1

1. MARCUS BRIMAGE VS RUSSEL DOANE-we start the main card out with a little feeling out with a few exchanges. Eventually it goes to the ground and Doane keeps it there up until the last minute threatening with the rear naked choke. In the second round Brimage starts strong dropping Doane and controlling for a while but Droane takes his back again and lands some really good shots making two rounds for him in my opinion. The final round is Brimage taking control with leg kicks and getting a few take downs. Doane takes the split D win here but I think he clearly won the fight, although one judge had him winning all three rounds and I think he lost the last. Marcus is a great guy though clapping for Doane when he was announced as the winner.

2. URIAH HALL VS THIAGO SANTOS-great first round between two guys who seemed pretty evenly matched. They both exchange kicks and punches until the last minute when Hall turns it up a little more. The second round looks much like the first with Hall looking a little better despite having a broken toe. Up until the last minute the third round looks very much the same as the previous two. From that point Santos controls most of that last minute, but Hall takes the UD. Santos also shows his class after the winner announcement.

3. RONDA ROUSEY VS ALEXIS DAVIS-now I am not a big Rousey fan and was very much rooting for Davis, that stopped 16 seconds into the first round. They exchange at first until Ronda lands then hits a knee and a trademark judo throw. From there she pounds on here until Davis is out, it is all over at 16 seconds.

4. CHRIS WEIDMAN VS LYOTO MACHIDA-the fight I was most looking forward to since I like both of these guys. The first round is good but Chris takes it with the pressure and the kicks he lands. The second round is even more of Weidman controlling and landing the better shots, particularly at the end with the takedown and the knees. In the third Weidman looks even more dominate landing some huge shots, cutting Machida and also getting some takedowns. The fourth round was very much Machida has he continued to land shot after shot and some vicious body kicks. The final round sees both men battle it out like crazy. Both land huge shots and Weidman even gets a takedown and takes Machidas back. After a hard fought battle Weidman gets the UD win, excellent fight.

DISC. 2

1. KEVIN CASEY VS BUBBA BUSH-the first fight of the night does not last that long as Bubba gets dropped and the Kevin pounces on him. After working on him a bit he starts to land some vicious elbows. That leads to the TKO victory for Casey.

2. LUKE ZACHRICH VS GUILHERME VASCONCELOS-a pretty even first round between these two that Luke may have just eked out slightly. Another good round for Luke although it was closer than Rogan makes it out to be, both land some good kicks. The final round is pretty much all Luke getting a nice sweep and landing some good shots, he gets the UD of course.

3. GEORGE ROOP VS ROB FONT-I very much thought that Roop was going to win this fight. Roop was doing well but so was Font who was getting in on Roop. Font lands a huge right hand that just sends Roop down and gives Font the KO win.

4. CHRIS CAMOZZI VS BRUNO SANTOS-good first round as they feels each other out but Chris takes the edge and the round landing just a bit more. The second round sees Santos takes Camozzi down and controls from the top for the majority of the round. The final round looks like a mix of the first two as Camozzi lands more on the feet and Santos gets the takedowns. Close fight which is why it was a split D but it goes Santoss way thanks to the takedowns.

5. KENNY ROBERTSON VS LLDEMAR ALCANTARA-the first round of this fight would see Kenny taking the round landing some good ground and pound after taking Alcantara down and controlling for the entire round. Kenny takes the next round as well taking him down and even getting mount at one point and threatening with submissions. The third round is much of the same minus two accidental low blows with Kenny getting the UD win here.

6. URIJAH FABER VS ALEX CACERES-now I am not a Faber fan really but I will admit that unless it is a title fight he is probably going to win. So with that said I was fairly sure he was going to win this based on the competition he had faced previously compared to his opponents. Things start out wild but once Faber gets it to the ground it stays there. The second round was all about Fabre working for and getting the takedowns. Still Alex does a little better here always making his way to his feet and landing some good shots himself. The third round is really short as Faber gets it to the ground once again and in the scramble takes his back and chokes him out, good fight over all.

Over all it was a good card with some good fights. I hate that the UFC did not add any special features here, no weigh-ins, behind the scenes or Countdown show. Other than that this is a good buy for any fan or collector.",1422316800,,5017,4.334754797441365

6316554,1,B00J2MQ0VU,"Just a heads up to the fans out there that the walk out music has been changed to generic guitars and beats. No ""California Love"" for Urijah Faber and no ""Born In The USA"" for Chris Weidman for example. Even more ridiculous is they added music to Joes breakdown of the finish or decision of the fight. This is not needed. I guess they didn't want to pay to get the rights to put the songs for home video but adding music where it never was is plain stupid.",1417219200,2,456,4.134831460674158

8647470,4,B00J2MQ0VU,"Theres only 1 exciting fight in this show.

Robbie Lawler vs Johny Hendricks
Robbie never delivered any kick in round 1. Johny skilfully mixed his fists with his kicks. Theyre very effective. At the end of round 2, Robbie delivered staggering blows to Johny.  In round 4, Johnys face was covered with his own blood. In round 5, its obvious that Johnys kicking and takedown techniques were superior. Theres no surprise at the end. This fight was worth 5 stars but the whole show was worth 4 stars because all the other fights were not good enough.

Nikita Krylov vs Ovince Saint Preux

The fight ended quickly in round 1 after Ovince had a choke hold on Nikita. Its interesting but its too short.

Hector Lombard vs Jake Shields
Hectors takedown techniques are superior. Its a lopsided fight.

Myles Jury vs Dieogo Sanchez
Its a balanced fight. Both fighters were skillful. Round 1 was bloody. Diego bled a lot from multiple cuts on his face.
Theres no clear victory at the end of round 3.

Tyron Woodley vs Carlos Condit
Tyron took down Carlos 4 times but Tyron could not finish Carlos. It unexpected ended in round 2 with a kick on the knee.",1432684800,,1142,4.568627450980392
8647471,4,B00J2MQ0VU,"Marcus Brimage vs Russel Doane
Its a balanced fight. Both fighters were skillful. Its so so.  It ended at the end of round 3.

Uriah Hall vs Thiago Santos
Both were very quick with their kicks. However, most of the times, the kicks were not effective. It ended at the end of round 3. Its a lukewarm fight.

George Roop vs Rob Font
An expected knockout in round 1.  Great but the fight was short.

Ronda Rousey vs Alexis Davis
Wow! Ronda knocked out her opponents in just 16 seconds. She took down Alexis with an excellent Judo throw. Then she kept punching until the referee stopped her. Ronda is truly a champion! Surprisingly, its the best fight of this show.

Chris Weidman vs Machida
Chris submission techniques were much more superior. The first 3 rounds were boring. Theyre lopsided. Machida had no chance to counter attack. The last 2 rounds were exciting. The result was an easy guess. Its a good fight but Rondas was much better.",1432512000,,938,4.553571428571429
