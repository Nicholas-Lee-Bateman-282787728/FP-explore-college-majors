8389354,5,B00361SAZ2,"This one gets rid of all the bad teaching the level one and level two ski instructors have taught you and gets you on track to skiing like a pro.  I got this to teach my 4 year old with.  Yes he watched it, took too tries for him to see it all though.  You should have seen him today.  What a difference.  We will watch it together a few more times and by the end of the week I will bet he is rock solid on blue to black runs.  This video is everything a beginner should know and an intermediate should understand but I'll bet your instructor did't share.",1484006400,,555,3.954954954954955

8389356,3,B00361SAZ2,"The video was fun to watch. There is quite a bit of material here, but some areas are not really detailed enough to give a solid understanding of what to do on the mountain. Fundamental concepts like basic positions on skis, traversing, skating are not addressed on the learn to ski part of the video. They did spend time on the crucial concept of balance. There is a good section on before season fitness routines, and an FAQ section. To be fair the progression from plough to parallel was a good overview to guide beginers & intermediates of what it should look like. Unfortunately, it's just that, an overview.
I would recommend this as a supplement to other DVDs like Martin Heckelman's Ski Tips (the bible of ski videos). It's filmed beautifully with a nice music score which will give one a lot of enthusiasm to go skiing. The presenters are interesting. I'd also recommend getting the 4 DVD series which covers bumps, powder, and carving. As I said at the begining, it's fun to watch. So enjoy it.",1289174400,,1004,4.614525139664805
