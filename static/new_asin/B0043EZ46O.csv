8414822,5,B0043EZ46O,"I've gotten most of Docs DVD's and have enjoyed them very much. If you are wanting ""Star Wars"" type graphics and etc. then you may not want his stuff. But if you want lots and lots of information -  then he is your guy. Some people find him to be a ""strange little fellow"". But the way I look at it - if he really is a former member of the Illuminati then he would be a strange little fellow , wouldn't he?",1500508800,,406,3.891566265060241
8414823,5,B0043EZ46O,I have watched the entire series and am impressed by the overwhelming amount of compelling evidence that Doc presents.  This video as part of the whole really helps develop a much clearer picture of how the end times prophecies are being brought into fulfillment.  I thank God for Doc and others like him who have escaped a fateful destiny and are bold enough to teach others the truth about what is really going on behind the scenes.,1471996800,2,434,4.623376623376624
8414824,5,B0043EZ46O,this was great need to get the whole set,1426809600,,40,3.5555555555555554
8414825,2,B0043EZ46O,"Some parts seemed to be accurate but other parts as far as prophecy and timelines given were just not accurate as far as I could muster. I had a hard time following the agenda of these 2 DVDs in this set. I just could not grasp that the book of Revelation was showing the Illuminati in prophecy. I do believe the Illuminati are part of the beast power just as are the Masons, Jesuits, New Age,USA, New World Order, Spiritualism, etc, but not the way this is advocated. There were parts I saw could be, but most just did not follow the bible line by line, precepet by precept, word by word, etc. I just did not get an unction for the information being supplied. Some aspects of the DVD documented the Illuminati etc well and truthfully, I will admit. You might accept the DVDs and believe that they are right on, but as for me I cannot and this is my belief. They did portray the Illuminati for what they are....part of the Beast Power.",1355875200,5,935,4.318181818181818
