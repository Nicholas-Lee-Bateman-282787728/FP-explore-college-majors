3916557,5,B002EAYDR0,"I received my DVD-R of Canyon River this morning from amazon.com. The sound is excellent, but the picture, although full CinemaScope width, appears to be of a lower resolution than usual, as if we are looking at a picture made up of less lines. This makes any horizontal lines on the image, such as window shutters or hat brims, shimmer, suggesting that this film has not been remastered but that an old television transfer from many years ago has been used. It appears to be the same transfer that was used on the old pan and scan version I have. Although Canyon River is a favourite of mine from the 1950's, I have knocked off one star because of the lack of remastering. Conversely, another 1950's Warner Archive Collection CinemaScope Western, Wichita, also arrived today from amazon.com and the image on the transfer is far better and of a much higher resolution and looks a treat.

Anyone wishing to buy these expensive Warner Archive releases, of which no reviews appear on the Internet except here, should take into consideration that some of them at least, haven't been remastered and are simply unrestored transfers that they've had in the vaults for many years. Also that these are burned DVD-R copies and not stamped like regular DVD's.",1259020800,16,1248,4.804651162790698
3916558,5,B002EAYDR0,"Like many now past middle age, I grew up watching Westerns starring George Montgomery, Audie Murphy, Joel McCrea, and Randolph Scott. Montgomery's were not quite on the same level as the Scott and McCrea oaters, but they were always entertaining. CANYON RIVER is solid entertainment, good action sequences---no, THE SEARCHERS or RIDE THE HIGH COUNTRY it is NOT, but fun, nevertheless, and maybe a bit nostalgic. Recommended.",1249862400,5,424,5.343283582089552
3916560,5,B002EAYDR0,"I HAVE ENJOYED PLAYING THIS DVD, I WANTED TO WATCH THIS FILM FOR A  LONG TIME BUT I WASN'T SURE IF IT WOULD PLAY ON PAL FORMAT.AS THE DVD  IS IN NTSC FORMAT WHICH IS REGION ONE. WARNER BROS; NOW SUPPY DVD'S, FOR ALL REGIONS AND MY PLAYER IS ABLE TO READ THE DISC AND THE PLAY BACK IS FIRST CLASS.",1409961600,,296,3.8360655737704916
3916561,4,B002EAYDR0,"Lots of really nice colorful outdoor location shots highlight this ""better than most"" Western programmer. Even the studio sets, interiors and campfire scenes, blend together pretty well as George Montgomery and foreman Peter Graves attempt to drive cattle from Oregon into Wyoming. No one in Oregon wants to hire on as trail drivers because for some reason it's crazy to raise cattle in Wyoming. Obviously no one here has read THE VIRGINIAN or is familiar with Medicine Bow, Wyoming.
Without giving away spoilers as to who's double crossing who for whatever reason, Montgomery bests outlaw gang leader Alan Hale Jr. in a really good saloon fight and wins Hale's respect and a cattle crew. Lots of cowboy humor and perils follow as Montgomery and hands deliver the cattle and the ""goods"" in an action-packed wrap up. Marcia Henderson is along to cook food and provide the love interest and doesn't get in the way at all. Even her son, Richard Eyer, is easier to take than most little kids in this type of movie. His scene with Montgomery at the end in which he offers support is even rather touching.
Director Harmon Jones made a handful of little Westerns in the 1950s showing how a little budget can go a long way. He does an exceptional job here as the acting, cinematography, and all 'round finished product come out top notch.
The dvd looks great, widescreen with vivid color. And throw in Robert Wilke as the main henchman to top it all off!
The cattle cross a body of water briefly in one scene, so I suppose that's the river of the title, but I really don't recall much of a canyon being shown even in the ambush at the conclusion. Still, all in all, an enjoyable and colorful trail drive for 50s Western fans.
This is definitely one to add to the collection.",1393286400,,1766,4.627388535031847
3916562,5,B002EAYDR0,"I enjoyed this 50s western very much and George Montgomery is one of my favourite western actors . The colour and wide screen presentation is excellent with nice western scenery ,complimented with an entertaining plot where Peter Graves acts as a friend who takes the wrong road and ends up on opposite sides to George, Amazon also has an excellent George Montgomery movie in stock which I also can highly recommend called Man From God's Country also in nice quality colour and wide screen , both of these very fine westerns not to be missed.

3916563,3,B002EAYDR0,"The good things are that we now can see or see again George Montgomery westerns and that the product is in top concerning picture sharpness and sound. The bad things are that Montgomery though tall and handsome is a little boring. He seems to lack ... IT! And the story is very much in lack of action. And somebody tell me when we are out there in the beautiful country why must we inside a studio every time there is a camp fire? Well, you can enjoy Allan Hale Jr. who here appears as Allan Hale only. He is a fine and warm actor like his father. Some day I will see it again and perhaps find it a little better and I am happy to have it in my collection.",1359331200,,656,4.015267175572519
3916564,5,B002EAYDR0,"Canyon River is one of those Montgomery Western films that is pure pleasure.  His wardrobe, including his signature
wide-brimmed hats, is beautiful.  He was 6ft 3inches and very slender so he looked great in anything he wore.
He is joined by the very handsome and talented Peter Graves who plays his ranch foreman. His barfight scenes with Alan
Hale are great.  Alan Hale turns in a very charming and warm performance as leader of the trail crew for the cattle
drive to Wyoming.  Marcia Henderson works very well with Montgomery and their romance is very warm and genuine. Her son is
played by Richard Eyer. He is a fine child actor who very quickly develops a friendship with Montgomery.
There is plenty of action in this movie and the supporting cast is very good. Definitely a movie worth watching
and adding to your collection of George Montgomery movies.",1316736000,2,859,4.783783783783784
3916565,4,B002EAYDR0,"Allied Artists Pictures presents ""CANYON RIVER"" (1956) (79 min/Color) -- Starring George Montgomery, Marcia Henderson, Peter Graves, Richard Eyer & Walter Sande

Directed by Harmon Jones

It's about time that this long lost western has been given the DVD treatment.

Trail boss Steve Patrick (George Montgomery) is assigned to guide a cattle drive from the west-coast state of Oregon to the wilds of Wyoming. En route, Steve must fend off attacks from both rustlers and Indians. He is also being undermined from within by foreman Bob Andrews (Peter Graves), who dearly covets Patrick's job. Into the mix, is widowed camp cook Janet Hale (Marcia Henderson) and both the men are keen on her.

Wonderful supporting cast of B-Western character actors -- Lane Chandler, Richard Eyer, Alan Hale Jr., Francis McDonald, Bud Osborne,Walter Sande, Ray Teal and Robert J. Wilke - many of them go back to the early days of '30s action packed westerns.

Recommend for all of us fans and collectors of good ole oaters that we grew up with.
