8074268,5,B000A3X49G,"This is a wonderful slice of life picture that beautifully captures the tone and spirit of New York City in the 70's.  Danny DeVito is a hoot.  Everyone can relate to this movie, especially today when so many adolescents live at home for extended periods of time.",1502928000,,263,4.574468085106383
8074269,3,B000A3X49G,"Modest low budget character study with a cast of unknowns and a young Danny DeVito in a few scenes.  Acceptable as an early 70s New York slice of life.  Not bad for passing the time, but nothing outstanding either, with variable acting and a little early 70s fashionable nudity.",1486944000,,278,4.653061224489796
8074270,5,B000A3X49G,"I was thrilled to find this movie.  My brother had a small part in it, a guest at a party.  We had been looking for it for years.  Gave it to him for a present.",1391817600,,160,3.5142857142857142
