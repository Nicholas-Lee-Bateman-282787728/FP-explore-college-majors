7834660,4,6303002935,"I'd give this 5 stars if it was in DVD.  This is another of BBC's greater TV comedy series, right-up there with ""Absolutely Fabulous"" ""Vicar of Dibley"" & ""Black Adder""  There is a total of 43 episodes which aired from: Oct 1989 to: Nov 2000.  This is a VERY funny series!!! They used to air them on local PBS/OPB tv stations.  I've been waiting for years for the DVD's and Im hoping I won't have one (or both) feet in the grave myself before they ever get around to making the complete series onto DVD! HINT-HINT  ALSO... while Im at it, EVEN BETTER is a UK Australian TV comedy sitcom called ""Mother and Son"" staring Ruth Cracknell an Garry McDonald that aired from 1983 thru 1993 with (42)VERY funny episodes.  For some reason this Australian series was airing in the US on a Portland Oregon PBS/OPB station back in the 80's when I discovered it.  This is one of Australia's classic hit sitcoms and I think its my favorite sitcom, even over my BBC favorites.  Im also hoping they put it on DVD...still checking for it after all these years. Its worth researching!",1125878400,7,1065,4.481865284974093

They say I might as well face the truth
That I am just too long in the tooth;
Though I'm an old 2way being relieved
But I have notyet quite gone to seed.

I may be over the hillnow that I have retired
Fading away but I'm not yet expired
Flapped out, run down, to old to save--
One foot in the grave.

They say I might as well face the truth
That I am just too long in the tooth,
I've started to deteriorate
I've passed my own ""sell by""date;

Oh, I'm no spring chicken it's true,
I have to pop my teeth in to chew;
And my old knees have started to knock,
I just have too many miles on the clock.

Though I'm wrinkly, crinkly, set in my ways--
It's true that my body has seen better days,
But give me half a chanceandI can still misbehave:
One foot in the grave--One foot in the grave.

7834662,5,6303002935,"Three episodes of the award-worthy series featuring the ultimate grumpy old man, these are a good example of what makes the series so unmissable.  Victor Meldrew, at first glance, comes across as the kind of person you  would go out of your way to avoid, but in fact he is quite a sympathetic  character - plagued by bad luck, constantly harassed by difficult and often  rather odd people, often feeling he is the only sane person in the world  (something we all feel at some time or another).  What makes the series  stand out from the usual sit-com is their serious undertones.  In fact I'd  go so far as to suggest this is a drama series which just happens to  contain comedy.  There is plenty of humour and hilarity, but also moments  of sensitivity (Victor's wife having to pretend to an elderly blind man  that junk-mail is actually a letter from his family rather than risk him  realizing they've forgotten all about him, Victor and his wife sadly  wondering how their son might have turned out were he alive today).  There  are even moments of thought-provoking philosophical musing (nothing exists  because the future hasn't happened yet, the past has already happened and  as soon as the present happens it's over).
One of the very best creations  of recent years, Victor Meldrew will surely join Basil Fawlty and Del  Trotter as comedy's household names.",967075200,19,1365,4.772532188841201
7834663,5,6303002935,"This video ""Who Will Buy?"" includes three episodes from series 2 of the series. The review above this says the series was short-lived, but that is untrue. A sixth series is planned for 2001 and in Britain, all 36  episodes can be bought on video. Try AMAZON.CO.UK if you want them!",961027200,13,281,4.509803921568627
7834664,5,6303002935,"One Foot in the Grave is a series to be viewed and enjoyed by its loyal followers, over and over again!  Although the series was sadly short-lived, here on videocassette, one can always enjoy its magnificent humour, wit and  British charm! Most certainly, I give this wonderful British series five  very enthusiastic stars, not to mention two very eager thumbs up!",933811200,8,364,4.934426229508197
