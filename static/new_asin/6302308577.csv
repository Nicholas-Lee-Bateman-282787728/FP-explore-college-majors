453335,4,6302308577,"I thought this might only interest science enthusiasts or real film buffs, but the acting and chemistry between Greer Garson (Mrs. Miniver) and Walter Pidgeon (Forbidden Planet) really  make science romantic.  There are other stars in the supporting cast, and they all do a great job bringing this slice of science history to life, including Robert Walker (Strangers on a Train), Van Johnson (30 Seconds Over Tokyo), Henry Travers (It's A Wonderful Life), C.Aubrey Smith (Beyond Tomorrow, Five Came Back), and Margaret O'Brien (Meet Me In St. Louis).  My favorite movies of this type are Edison The Man with Spencer Tracy, and Young Tom Edison with Mickey Rooney; but the sheer quantity of raw talent makes Madame Curie just as good as those favorites.",1117411200,36,752,5.048387096774194

453373,4,6302308577,"If you are either a fan of historical science biographies or another pairing of Greer Garson and Walter Pidgeon in films than this movie is the ""cure"". The only other male/female multiple pairing over the years that rivals this pair would be Powell and Loy. Thats great company to be in.
It is not their best film together (that would be Mrs. Miniver) but it is a very fine performance for both in this genre. IT CERTAINLY DOES NOT COMPARE TO SOME OF THE TRULY GREAT BIOPICS EPICS LIKE BRAVEHEART but has its own charm . Just the reuniting of this pair should draw your attention as these actors are bread and butter. They work so well together. The bonus is the subject matter which was one of the great and tedious discoveries that changed the face of chemistry and physics.
The story concentrates on their (The Curies) meeting , early married years which led to the collaboration in the discovery of radium and the acceptance of a woman as scientist to be taken seriously.
Madame Curie(married name) was a brilliant polish student placed in the lab of male scientist who did not take women seriously as both qualified scholars and potential romantic interest. Mr. Pidgeon is very convincing in his fear of this new threat to his manhood and scientific station at the University from this new intrusion in his life. These scenes play well on the screen and are fun to watch. Acceptance of this woman who has intruded in his comfortable life is finally acceptable to him as he is so impressed with her academic skills. Their permanent coupling follows so quickly with true love and admiration for each other (Only in the movies). They both work for years at their proving her discovery . She is finally given the credit due her with the help of her devoted husband.
The basic facts are accurate but the film does take great liberties with their romance and mutual devotion. But this is necessary so these two fine stars can show how well they play off of each other on the screen. It does add interest and as stated earlier creates some fun for the viewer.  One or the other are in every scene as there is not much going on without their presence. The film is a vehicle for putting them together again on the screen. But there are  important topics protrayed in this production. Primarilary the discovery of radium and also the acceptance of the equality of a woman scientist.
It is an all round fine 1940's production for two great actors.",1440892800,,2441,4.609195402298851

453399,5,6302308577,"At the age of thirty-eight, Greer Garson may have gotten a late start as a world class actress but in MADAME CURIE, Garson gave the impressive performance that won her an Oscar in MRS. MINIVER. In MADAME CURIE, she reunites with Walter Pidgeon to present a duo of struggle, first with her alone trying to establish herself as a woman scientist in a world dominated by a patriarchy determined to keep women out of the laboratory and later with her and her husband who spend years struggling against poverty, lack of support, and a dangerously unsafe working environment. MADAME CURIE is a bio epic of the 1940s that focuses on the theme of struggle against stupendous odds. We meet her at the film's beginning as Marie Skolodska, a Polish immigrant studying mathematics and physics at the University of the Sorbonne. As Marie, Garson is a woman possessed by the self-imposed task of getting her degree and returning to Poland to teach. Nothing must be allowed to disrupt her plans, nothing that is until she meets the socially fumbling Pierre Curie, with whom she soon obtains a working relation. Science may indeed reign supreme in both her mind and his, but little by little each learns that they are both better off together than apart. In one amusing scene, Pierre attempts to propose marriage using the metaphor of chemical bonding that produces a stronger version of two separate elements. Neither uses the word ""love"" as a basis for marriage, but Garson and Pidgeon's acting makes this bumbling omission entirely believable and appropriate. On a vaster level, this metaphor of strength through bonding resonates through and structures the film. They face enormous challenges that they can overcome only if they work together in harmony. Director Mervyn Leroy does not allow mention of the outside world to act as a distraction. The world-wrecking carnage of the First World War is nowhere present. Even having children is delicately handled offscreen. The Curies somehow manage two children who float into the story but do little more than act as props to present a marriage as stable and conventional. Madame Curie and husband spend years uncovering the existence of radium. The movie hints at the destructive power of radiation poisoning but pooh-poohs radium's lethality by glossing over its baneful effect on Madame Curie. What MADAME CURIE relentlessly presents is the image of a duo that allows nothing and no one to stop them from achieving sainthood into a scientific pantheon.  This is a powerful movie that derives its strength more from an idea of struggle than from character exposition. Still, one should not dismiss it merely as a heavy-handed morality play (which in truth in parts it is) without also granting that the struggle against odds is a stirring reminder that life is sometimes more than watching characters grow and prosper on film. MADAME CURIE reminds us that audiences may also relate to the most primitive of urges: to triumph when everyone else says that such triumph cannot happen.",1422662400,2,3019,5.001988071570577
453400,5,6302308577,"What a wonderful couple to go through so much so that radiation could have been discovered for all and have saved so many lives. I loved this movie. Thanks for making it available. It was a quick way to learn and enjoy at the same time. I love these old flicks!

453403,5,6302308577,"Simply put, this movie is a beautiful scientific love story based on the lives of Madame Curie and her husband, Dr. Pierre Curie.  Madame Curie being the only woman to win the Nobel Prize twice for her scientific discoveries.  She and her husband were a scientific collaboration and the movie does such a lovely job of showing how they lived their laboratory work , but also loved each other very much.  Some of the early scenes are even quite comical.  And the movie really dramatizes beautifully and fairly accurately their discovery of radium.  It highlights how this new element had properties that were inconceivable in the scientific school of thought of the era.  Greer Carson and Walter Pidgeon as Madame and Dr. Curie, respectively, do a superb job of acting.  And I found myself drawn into the love story as well as the science.  Which I think is the power of this excellent film, it actually gets one excited about scientific discoveries and the world around us.  It is also perfectly clean and quite suitable for all ages.  I can't recommend this movie enough.",1410912000,,1072,4.7771739130434785

453425,3,6302308577,"This is a delightful afternoon, or public holiday watch. The opening scenes are so comical and memorable as Greer and Walter introduce these two historical characters; Peirre and Marie. Walter, the icon of stiff, gentryship (if there such a word) and respectability and Greer plays a somewhat bumbling, a little downtrodden, but incongruously charming, very intelligent and eventually successful Marie.
This is the following, for these two, after the triumph of the enchanting, but wonderfully sad 'Mrs Miniver' productions (highly recommended). This movie is also a wonderful way of conveying or teaching history of science to a mature audience. I found it an enjoyable watch, but may not fully worth the UK import fee. But if you have fallen in love with the Greer Garson and Walter Pigeon pairing as I have this is a wonderful addition to your collection.",1395446400,,858,5.135714285714286

453428,5,6302308577,"This is one of the great scientific biography films of the 1930s. It tells the story of Madame Curie from her student days to the death of her husband Pierre. I'm sure they played fast and loose with some of the details, but they did so to capture the higher truth of this adventure story, and an adventure it was. The 19th century was a time of scientific triumph, but there were hints that our understanding was incomplete. There were the elements and two forces, gravity and electricity, but there were hints of others, and the Curies played a major role in teasing out the nature and substance of radioactivity by sheer dint of heroic chemistry. It's a wonderful story both of science and of a collaboration, a friendship and a marriage.

Greer Garson was great as Madame Curie. Yes, she may have chewed her share of the scenery, but the story was larger than life. She was one of the Prometheans exploring the basic nature of our reality. The story was larger than life, and Garson stepped it up to play the role. The real treat were the two men in her life. Walton Pidgeon played a Pierre Curie as a true poet, a man caught up in the glory and wonder of the world. Henry Travers played his father, a down home country doctor, outspoken, crotchety, but insightful and grounded.

The movie was made in 1943, so it wasn't filmed on location, but it captured the spirit of the time and place. Since it was made in 1943, we all know that Madame Curie was due for another round of the headlines just a few years later. If anything, it makes the story even more powerful, and more fun.

As a movie, I'd have to give this maybe four stars. The pacing is a bit uneven at times. On its own terms, however, I've given it five.",1390003200,,1721,4.38871473354232
453429,5,6302308577,"Greer Garson is very touching in her role as one of the greatest role models for women in science. She performs this role with poise and elegance. Walter Pidgeon also offers a fine performance in the lead role as Pierre Curie. Originally, Madame Curie was to star Greta Garbo with George Cukor as director and Aldous Huxley as the writer, but MGM chose Greer Garson and Mervyn LeRoy. There was a great deal of pessimism on the part of MGM that a movie like this would have any impact on the box office during the war years, but the cast did a terrific job. Script writers Paul Osborn and Paul Rameau treated Eve Curie's biography of her parents with care and reverence. Melvyn LeRoy added beauty and drama for this splendid movie of one of the greatest scientist ever lived. Madame Curie is the only scientist who is awarded two Nobel Prizes, one for physics and another for chemistry.

Madam Curie meets her future husband at a dinner party hosted by her tutor: Initially Pierre is hesitant to let a woman work in his laboratory. Being shy and very conservative in his approach, he says that women do not fit into the role of a scientist. This would be a ghastly statement for a 1943 movie, although the movie is set in 1893. Some of the dialogues are a little startling and odd. For example, Before introducing Marie to his parents, he tells her ""how much she will like his father,"" and further states that  his ""mother's quite gay - you'll enjoy them both!"" When Pierre leaves the house in rain, Marie says, ""Don't forget your rubbers!""

The film covers only part of her life, since it does not deal with her political activism to liberate her native Poland, and also her strong bonding with her sister and parents. The most touching part of the movie is when Pierre dies in a car accident in the main street of a busy shopping district, and the news of his death stuns Marie. This is a very sensitive and emotional situation that put one's mind in a state of deep shock; director Mervyn LeRoy handled this scene wonderfully.",1389744000,,2028,4.53551912568306
453430,5,6302308577,"Honestly, I don't know enough about Marie Curie to say that this movie's spot on.  I do know enough about Hollywood to feel comfortable stating that there was some dramatic license taken.
That said, I love this movie.  Marie Curie did things that women just didn't do, good things, and she did them well.  According to this portrayal, her husband backed her to the limit, risking his own health in a soul-breaking grind of daily physical labor - right beside her.
Greer Garson played this role with simple dignity and her soft laugh.  She has a particularly choice moment when Professor Curie ""proposes,"" and she asks, ""What do you think I should do?""
Walter Pidgeon, as Monsieur Curie, seemed to actually step into the role he was given.  He is quite charming as the kind but forgetful professor, who comes back for Marie when he realizes she has no umbrella in the rainstorm, and delivering a unique proposal with believable fervor.
If you like ""based on true stories"" and don't mind a story taking its time, I think you'll like this movie.",1383955200,,1042,4.7032967032967035
453451,5,6302308577,"The DVD Madame Curie is a story about science but there is too a beautiful love story well woven into the rather interesting main plot detailing the discovery of Radium by the husband & Wife Team Curie.  This movie is way too nice for me to give you any spoilers.  Madame Curie is so well written that any spoilers would destroy the intricate joy and mystery of the work.  This is one of my most favorite movies that I watch on cold rainy days at home.  Madame Curie was written and acted with great sensitivity.  The period machines and tragic ending add much to the movie.  The finale is an uplifting testament to the ultimate rewards of hard work and dedication in the face of grueling adversities.  Madame Curie reminds us that science gives its greatest rewards only after series of the most bitter disappointments, blind paths, fortunate mistakes and unexpected blessings. Madame Curie is always a joy for me to watch.  If you are a fan of great film of black and white era Madame Curie is a must have for your collection.",1380153600,,1028,4.548913043478261

453512,4,6302308577,"This movie is more like a documentary than the average movie that features such stars as Greer Garson. It portrays the working life of scientist Marie Curie and succeeds in showing the challenges she faced as a woman as well as a scientist during a time in history when science required hard physical labor. Ms. Curie's years long search for the source of radium, working with her devoted husband inside a drafty, leaky old building (because she was a woman  this is the best ""laboratory"" space the school was willing to give her) is truly inspiring. We see her fulfill her responsibilities as a college professor, wife, and mother of two while carrying on her experiments in the face of repeated failures. Her health begins to suffer after years of lack of proper sleep and exposure to radiation and still she presses on, never giving in or giving up.  It is so gratifying to see her finally accomplish her goal.  The movie is also something of a love story between Madame Curie and her scientist husband who is by her side throughout her work, helping and supporting her every step of the way.  I suppose the whole thing is a bit corny as many of these older movies are. But it's a very very good movie--well written and well executed. It tells a terrific story of one of history's best and brightest people.",1358640000,3,1310,4.609442060085837
453513,5,6302308577,"There probably is no more fascinating discovery than that of radium and no more fascinating story about how a discovery was made. It gives us all a glimpse into the type of minds that most of us simply cannot fathom. How is anyone born with those abilities. I guess it's like Mozart being born knowing how to write and play music. The amount of work they were willing to do under such terrible conditions is very well portrayed. I enjoyed the ""hollywoodized"" story of these two people. I hope they were really like this because it makes a really sweet story that I enjoyed very much. Of course, Walter Pidgeon, poor thing, was never a good actor and against Greer Garson he is hopelessly lost but it's not terribly annoying because this is Garson's picture all the way.

She had to deal with the prejudices of the male establishment towards women, with the inferior facilities supplied to her, and an immense physical workload.  Yet despite this, she and her husband, Pierre, turned her initial small physical observation into a leap in scientific achievement. For this, they were awarded a Nobel Prize in science.

453583,4,6302308577,"Greer Garson stars as Madame Marie Curie, the famous Polish scientist who discovered radium and won two Nobel Prizes.  The story details her struggle to obtain degree at the Sorbonne when it was uncommon for women to pursue higher education, especially in science.  However, her extraordinary intellect and hard work slowly wins over her professors.  One of them, Professor Perot (Albert Bassermann), finds room for her in the lab of Pierre Curie (Walter Pidgeon), a shy physics professor who doesn't approve of women being scientists.  He worries that Marie will be too talkative and disrupt his work.  Of course, the two end up falling in love and becoming life-long collaborators.  When Marie discovers radium, they have to put in years of back-breaking work to isolate the element.  Marie even ends up with radiation burns on her hands, although no one even know what radiation was at the time.  The movie climaxes with their scientific breakthroughs, although tragedy mars their happiness.

""Madame Curie"" was the third pairing of Garson and Pidgeon, following ""Blossoms in the Dust"" (1941) and ""Mrs. Miniver"" (1942), both of which are superior to this film.  As with ""Mrs. Miniver,"" Garson and Pidgeon were Oscar nominated for their leading roles here.  The pair has great chemistry (bad pun!) as always.  The film is well-made and moves along at a nice pace; however, it's the kind of extremely glossy affair you'd expect from a 1940s MGM movie.  Much of Marie Curie's life is ignored, particularly her political activities.  As long as you aren't expecting accuracy here, you'll probably enjoy ""Madame Curie,"" which focuses on (and probably exaggerates) the romance between Marie and her husband.",1241395200,2,1704,5.149090909090909

There are some facts that are not real and are not according to most of the books written about their biographies. For example, on the film we see Pierre Curie's death after buying earings for Marie. That's a lie.

Who would have thought that the discovery of radium would make for an exciting drama? This necessitates some fictionalization. There is no mention of Marie Curie's political involvement and concern for the fate of her native Poland. However Pidgeon and Garson are interesting to watch on the screen.  Though appearing now somewhat tame, it is interesting to note that here is the story of a woman who not only has a career, but also wins two Nobel Prizes.  Quite a departure from the usual woman's picture plot devices which generally revolve around marriage and children.

453616,5,6302308577,"""Madame Currie"" finally comes to us on DVD after a slow trickle of Greer Garson's films of the early forties, when she was one of the biggest stars on the MGM lot.  Sure this film has flaws, but if you want pure facts, read a history book on the subject.  Those of us familiar with  MGM's grand treatment of this kind of biographical picture expect the melodrama, the lush costumes and scenery and all that entails.  But we do get a glorious Greer Garson performance, an Oscar nominated portrait of a strong, intelligent and caring woman.

Miss Garson had an amazing string of five consecutive Best Actess nominations from 1941 through 1945.  While other deserving actresses get the grand ""box set"" treatments (Davis, Crawford, Garbo, etc.), it's a shame the powers that be haven't honored Miss Garson with the same respect.  Yes, we're happy we've finally gotten ""Random Harvest,"" ""Mrs. Miniver"" and ""Goodbye, Mr. Chips"" on DVD, and recently ""Pride and Prejudice,"" but we still hope and patiently wait for those other great early forties Oscar nominated films to be released on DVD:  ""Blossoms in the Dust,"" ""Mrs. Parkington"" and ""The Valley of Descion"" from '41, '44 and '45, respectively.  One would hope that all the many Greer Garson fans can create enough groundswell support for this great actress to have all these great films eventually released on DVD.  She deserves the treatment she earned: that of a true star and legend, as well as being one of the best actresses in the business.",1159488000,26,1494,4.846456692913386

Madame Curie shows us, by far she is one the great heroes of the science. Well documented portrait, supported by a fine direction of Melvin Le Roy, as well as the unerring chemistry between my beloved Green Carson (one of the five top American actresses any age) and Walter Pigdeon as his lovable and loyal husband.

The final sequence when she makes that brief but remarkable speech is simply anthological.

7824431,5,6302308577,"If Myrna Loy hadn't been around, maybe Greer Garson would've been my all-time favorite actress. She was so great. She projected beauty and grace and elegance and a sense of ease and accessability that made her so very sympathetic in whichever role she played. Me, I'm not much into biographies or biopics. But I'll watch anything that Greer Garson has ever done. Fresh off the highs of BLOSSOMS IN THE DUST and her Academy Award-winning turn in MRS. MINIVER, she next tackled the daunting project, MADAME CURIE. Except how do you make the discovery of radium interesting and entertaining to the masses?

Garson plays Marie Sklodowska, a poor and starving student from Warsaw, Poland who is attending the Sorbonne, the prestigious university in Paris, an institution what's celebrated as the mother of learning.

Poor and starving, yes, but, also, keen and supremely focused on earning two masters degrees, one in physics, one in mathematics. His name escapes me, but Marie Sklodowska will owe much to that old professor who rescues her when, malnourished and spent, she faints in class. Later, this benevolent old man will do her an even greater kindness when he inveigles a colleague to allow her to work in his laboratory.

That colleague is bashful French physicist Pierre Curie (Walter Pidgeon), described as a poet with brains, a poet in the laboratory, and who harbors a commonplace bias then practiced by menfolk in general at the turn of the century. Professor Curie posits that ""A woman loves life for the living of it. In the world of abstract research, she's a danger, a distraction. She's the natural enemy of science."" And, also, ""Women of genius are rare. No true scientist can have anything to do with women."" Geez, chill, Pierre.

Give the movie credit. Marie Sklodowska doesn't immediately bowl the professor over. Days and weeks and months elapse before the man realizes that he'd grown fond of her. Marie is a striking beauty, true (or at least the Greer Garson version of her), but there's also that she's a dedicated worker and exudes remarkable intelligence. Their courtship unfolds in unorthodox fashion. Attend to their conversation as they stroll down the avenue one evening. To you and me, the following discussion may reek of dispassionate gobblelygook. But to Marie and Pierre, it's as if someone were playing the violin on a moonlit night:

- Marie: ""In the symmetries L-Sub-Q and 2L-Sub-Q, you include only those rotations which are integral multiples of 2pi over Q.""
- Professor Curie: ""But 2pi times K over Q excludes the identity transformation if K is not an integer.""

Stop, my beating heart.

The chemistry between Garson and Pidgeon is palpable. Maybe that comes from natural synergy; maybe it comes from this being their fourth film together. They would co-star in a total of nine films. This is absolutely Garson's vehicle. But you mustn't overlook Pidgeon's fine performance. He lends dignity and warmth to what otherwise could have been a drab character.

MADAME CURIE is based on the 1937 biography penned by Marie Curie's daughter, Eve. It's a prestige motion picture, endowed with topnotch production treatment and directed by Mervyn LeRoy who also directed the pair in BLOSSOMS IN THE DUST. No surprise at all that MADAME CURIE (1943) raked in a fistful of Academy Award nominations, including Best Actress, Best Actor, and Outstanding Motion Picture. Too bad it had to go up against CASABLANCA.

Off the top of my head I can think of three other movies I prefer to MADAME CURIE - GOODBYE, MR. CHIPS (1939), PRIDE AND PREJUDICE (1940), RANDOM HARVEST (1942) - but that doesn't undermine how much I like this movie and how tremendous it is. The two leads absolutely breathe life into the Curies. They humanize these historical figures. I became fascinated not only with their unconventional yet very sweet romance but with how they went about doggedly pursuing what would become their life's work. As you know, Marie Curie was the first female scientist to win the Nobel Prize and the first person to win the thing twice. And, as you know, she discovered the 7th element, radium, which is responsible for life-saving medical advances like the x-ray and radiation treatment for cancer and for furthering genetic studies, but radium is also held accountable for life-taking devices like the atom bomb. So, a triumphant tale. And a cautionary tale.

The movie documents the years and years of unflagging research put in by the Curies, often under untenable conditions, often under the cloud of doubt from the public and their colleagues. Marie was shown to be the obstinate driving force, except she could never have achieved her breakthroughs were it not for her husband's support and encouragement and application of his own prodigious brain. Put yourself in the halls of academia in those days. Imagine the uproar, the mass harrumphing, triggered by the Curies' discovery, how radium shook up the foundations of science and confounded the science world's cocksure certainty that all elements were inert. Not a bad job for someone scoffed for being ""young, inexperienced, and a woman"" by a disdainful panel approached by the Curies in hopes of appropriating a larger laboratory and more research equipment.",1518307200,,5249,5.022988505747127
