957359,2,6305026130,"""Young Tiger"" is a pretty bad movie no matter what way you look at it.  The acting is bad, the fights are mediocre, the dubbing is bad, and the focusing is terrible.  It is almost like an amateur with a camcorder woke up one day and decided to make a movie.  The only reason that I gave this DVD two stars is because Jackie Chan is in the movie.",996105600,4,345,3.971014492753623

957361,1,6305026130,"Don't know why this is always listed under Meng Fei, he might be in it 5 seconds.  Jackie Chan plays a bad guy, which is rare, but never gets to show off properly. He sports a mole on his cheek about the size of a golf  ball. For completists only, for historical purposes only, not for  entertainment!  I have warned you!",951868800,,321,4.213114754098361

7881689,2,6305026130,Chinese movie that is poorly dubbed. A succession of challenge fights that looked pretty bad and the characters were bad actors and lousy story line.,1398902400,,149,5.0
7881690,3,6305026130,"I did not see Jackie Chan anywhere in this, and I mean *anywhere*. He may have been an extra, I don't know, but I certainly did not see a ""cameo"". The lead character did not really seem to use the tiger style, either. All told, though, the movie was pretty decent.",1360972800,,264,4.196078431372549
7881691,1,6305026130,"Apparently there are two Jackie Chan - The Young Tiger moives.  This review is for the one in which J Chan is one of the bad guys and it is a supporting role.  It is so bad I can't believe I made it through the whole movie.  I don't expect high theatre from Hong Kong kung fu movies but even the fight scenes are very sub par.  One of the charming things about Jackie Chan is that he doesn't take himself too seriously; his characters always do something goofy, comical, endearing.  Since he is the bad guy and just a supporting actor, he can't/doesn't do anything goofy, comical or endearing.  And the mole looks less like a mole and more like he has a leech on his face.  If I could give it -0- stars for -0- entertainment value I would.",1359763200,,739,4.198581560283688
7881692,1,6305026130,"I watched this movie in its entirety, however the character shown in the thumbnail image never appears in it, nor do the other stars noted in the description.  This is clearly the wrong movie or the wrong description.  Please fix.",1351123200,,230,4.725
7881693,3,6305026130,"First of all, I think they should give the information that there are two different HK movies with the title ""(The) Young Tiger"".

One with Meng Fei starring (this one),
another&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jackie-Chan/dp/B00005B33R/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jackie Chan</a>&nbsp;as one of the villains (very small role).
The cover art has nothing to do with the movie.
(This often happens to old kung fu DVDs.)

Meng Fei was just a newcomer at this time and the fighting scenes are dull (not only because of him) and the story is boring.
If you are not a collector of his movies, I won't recommend this one.
This is a contemporary action film, and Meng Fei is an ordinary young guy.
You may feel strange if you are used to see him playing an classic Chinese hero like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fang-Shi-Yu-series/dp/B0001ZX0ME/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fang Shi Yu series</a>.
His sharp eyes, brilliant smiles are already seen in his&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/debut-film/dp/B00001U0E8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">debut film</a>, and here, too.

Young Lau Kar Wing (Liu Jia Rong) appears as a villain and a choreographer.
You cannot completely rely on Amazon's data, there are so many incorrect info.",1321315200,,1345,6.461111111111111
7881694,1,6305026130,"I bought this DVD after seeing young Jackie Chan posing with some serious kung fu move on teh cover.  This movie has really nothing to do with Jackie Chan.  He plays some back drop bad guy with a huge mold on his face.  You do not see any great fighting moves at all.  Here is another things, why is this move called ""Young Tiger""?  It should be called a female cop and a taxi driver.  A guy who plays the taxi driver and a female playing cop are the lead actors in this move.  None of their characters are memorable, and their fighting moves does not impress.  Skip this movie!",1130976000,,578,4.1909090909090905
7881695,2,6305026130,"IN THIS MEDIOCRE JACKIE CHAN MOVIE, A GIRL THAT'S IN A GANG TRYS TO GET OUT BUT THE GANG WON'T STOP TO HUNT HER DOWN. BUT WHEN SHE DIES IN A TAXICAB ON THE WAY TO THE HOSPITAL, THE CABDRIVER BECOMES A TARGET OF THE GANG, WHO THINKS HE HAS THE GIRL'S PURSE. THIS IS VERY MEDIOCRE FOR A JACKIE CHAN MOVIE. THE STORY IS DUMB, THE SCRIPT IS WACK, AND MOST OF THE FIGHTS ARE LUDICROUS. THOUGH JACKIE CHAN IS ON THE COVER OF THIS MOVIE, HE DOESN'T REALLY DO MUCH. THE ONE GOOD THING ABOUT THIS FILM IS THE FACT THAT WE FINALLY GET TO SEE WHAT IT'S LIKE TO SEE CHAN AS A VILLAIN. WANT A BETTER JACKIE CHAN MOVIE FROM THE EARLIER DAYS? CHECK OUT ''THE YOUNG MASTER'' OR ''SNAKE IN THE EAGLE'S SHADOW''.",1059436800,,694,4.036231884057971
