2726760,5,B000M7FSSA,I remember watching Rich Little's Christmas Carol multiple times each Christmas on HBO as a kid back in the 80's and loving it. after they stopped airing it I never saw it again until now thanks to this wonderful DVD. It was a Christmas tradition for me as a child and now I have reinstated that tradition once again. I had searched for this title for years both on TV and on home video so I was thrilled to see it once again. Rich Little's impressions are great and work very well in this condensed version of the Dickens classic.,1206489600,4,531,4.32
2726761,5,B000M7FSSA,for those of us over 50 you may remember seeing this version on television years ago.... after many years without seeing this video its just as much fun to watch as it was even then.....as far as the younger crowd chances are they will not understand what is going on due rich little using the popular media figures from years past..... overall very enjoyable,1201046400,,359,4.625
2726762,5,B000M7FSSA,"I have been waiting decades for this to come out. I originally saw it on TV when it first came out and foolishly did not record it. I have been hoping that it would either be rebroadcast or come out in DVD format, as this is one of my favorite versions of the Dickens classic. I have always been a fan of Rich Little and it is amazing how well he can do all those impersonations. If you have never seen this version, I highly recommend that you do. Now that I have it on DVD, it will be a show, I make a point to watch every Christmas. I would also recommend that you check out Rich Little's show on US Presidents.",1200009600,,614,4.0
2726763,5,B000M7FSSA,"I remember seeing Rich Little's Christmas Carol back when it came out on HBO in '78. I was pretty young but still knew who the characters were. It was hillarious then and I have been hoping that HBO would release it (now its here)! The songs and dialogue make this a fresh take on this classic story.

I would recommend this to just about everyone. Thanks so much to HBO and Rich Little for this gem!",1199750400,,400,4.2631578947368425
2726764,5,B000M7FSSA,"Sure it's made in 1978 but that's its charm (before CGI ruled the world film makers had to be a bit more special effects creative). I really think this is a great blend of characters, comedy and story. It's a shorter version, of course, not as involved, basicaly made just for the comedy. Rich Little's impersonations are right on and it all just makes for some dated, a little cheesy, Christmas, leave reality behind fun. It may not be for all but those that 'get it' will enjoy it. I'm glad this is out on DVD again. I remember watching this on HBO back in the early 80's during Christmas and just laughing.",1198540800,18,609,4.398230088495575
2726765,5,B000M7FSSA,Rich Little's Christmas Carol is EXCELLENT - the best part is you also get a second feature on this DVD - Rich Little's Robin Hood.  He is still the GREATEST!,1196985600,2,158,4.266666666666667
2726766,3,B000M7FSSA,"I bought this for my dad because he likes watching it every year and it is a great show. I looked around for a long time to find the DVD version and I was excited to get it but the excitement was soon over after I watch the DVD and the Video and Audio are as if you were watch an old warn out VCR tape, I thought for the high price of this item that it was professionally premastered but it not. You could get the same quality by just recording the VCR version onto a DVD. If you don't have the VCR version I guess I might buy the DVD then.",1193356800,27,540,3.7876106194690267
2726767,5,B000M7FSSA,This DVD is very funny.  The Christmas Carol is just how it was shown for the first time on TV.  Although the Robin Hood one had some scenes removed such as when Robin Hood met Friar Tuck for the first time.  Other than that it was fun to watch those two programs again.  I most definately recommend this DVD. Signed Erin Eastwood,1191283200,15,330,4.274193548387097

2726806,5,B000M7FSSA,"Like other reviews have mentioned here, I loved watching ""Rich Little's Christmas Carol"" on HBO where it ran for many years.  I was very happy to learn that the special was finally available on DVD and I ordered my own copy as soon as I could.

Rich Little's take on Charles Dickens' classic tale will have you laughing all the way through from start to finish.  The dialogue is very well written and still delivers laughs after many viewings.  What also makes this special work is the clever selection of what people are in certain roles.  Having Richard Nixon in the Jacob Marley role is one such example.  Having the ghost appear not in chains but rather the Watergate Tapes is just plain terrific.  Another example is Truman Capote as Tiny Tim.

Another high point of ""Rich Little's Christmas Carol"" is the terrific soundtrack.  The songs, ""This Will Be the Merriest Christmas Yet"" and ""That's What I Like About Christmas"" are excellent.  Christmas classics in my opinion.  Another song which is just as great is sung by Scrooge and Dick Wilkins (Little as WC Fields and Jimmy Stewart respectively.) at Old Fezziwig's.  I always wondered why there was a never a soundtrack for this program available.  There was certainly enough terrific music to warrant one.

The quality of the DVD is quite good as well.  There is a very good commentary by Rich Little and ""Christmas Carol""'s director.  It makes watching the program even more enjoyable.  The picture quality of the DVD is quite good as well.  Not the best ever by today's digital standards, but still of very good quality.

As far as ""Robin Hood"" is concerned, I will admit I have not watched that program in its entirety so I can't comment on it here.  I liked what I have seen of it, but I have yet to see it all which is why this review is primarily focused on ""Rich Little's Christmas Carol"".

""Rich Little's Christmas Carol"" is a great Christmas special that I have always made sure I watched every Christmas.  I highly recommend you give it a look.  Maybe it will be come part of your Christmas tradition.  Merry Christmas!",1387929600,2,2087,4.654794520547945

2726811,5,B000M7FSSA,"After all this time, this made-for-TV film is still fun to watch as only Rich Little can make it.  Some of it is a little dated today, but all of it is very funny.  My favorites are still the three Christmas Ghosts, interpreted as Humphrey Bogart, Columbo, and Inspector Clousseau.  And if that doesn't intrigue you, then Jacob Marley played as Richard Nixon certainly will!  So come along for a delightful adventure.
Oh...Robin Hood hasn't a thing to do with Charles Dickens, but it has Rich Little and his great collection of impersonations, and that is enough to know.",1356739200,,571,4.737373737373737

2726821,5,B000M7FSSA,"My holiday season is not complete until I have watched ""Rich Little's Christmas Carol"".

I have fond memories of watching the program in the late '70's/early 80's as a youngster. Where else can you see such a star-studded cast assembled together? W.C Fields, Groucho Marx, John Wayne, James Mason, Jimmy Stewart, Edith Bunker, Laurel & Hardy...it's simply amazing the way Rich can manifest so many Hollywood legends in such a convincing manner. I was too young to know who half these celebrities were at the time but I still loved the program.

At some point in the mid-80's ""Christmas Carol"" stopped being shown on television. In the intervening years I had to rely on a hissy low-fi VHS tape that I had recorded off of PBS with my family's very first VCR. It was better than not seeing the special at all, though.

For years and years I dreamed of the day that ""Rich Little's Christmas Carol"" would be released on DVD. Then, finally, it happened; while surfing the internet I found the disc being sold via Rich Little's website. I wasted no time and ordered my copy. When it arrived it was everything I had hoped it would be.

Picture quality is solid. You have to remember these specials were videotaped for television in the late 70's. They aren't going to look ""high-def"". But there's certainly nothing remotely lackluster in the presentation. Good picture and sound.  As an added bonus to ""Christmas Carol"" you receive ""Rich Little's Robin Hood"". Unfortunately, ""Robin Hood"" lacks all the charm of ""Christmas Carol"". I don't know what went wrong, but every joke falls flat. It's actually somewhat hard to sit through. The impressions are as good as ever but the program totally misses the mark. A further DVD bonus feature is an informative commentary track featuring Rich Little himself. You'll learn all about the production of the specials.

If you share fond memories of Rich Little's ""Christmas Carol"" like I do I would suggest you waste no time purchasing this DVD. It is every bit as good as you remember. If you are unfamiliar with this program but are a fan of the Hollywood stars of yesteryear and good old fashioned family entertainment, maybe ""Rich Little's A Christmas Carol"" can become a annual tradition in your home the way it has in mine.

Thank you, Rich.",1330560000,6,2279,4.783715012722646
2726822,3,B000M7FSSA,"I've been watching Rich Little's Christmas Carol since my family first got cable and HBO in the early 80s.  Much beloved by me.  I was already a big fan of rich Little from his appearances on the talk shows (Carson, etc) and even did my own impressions like he does to entertain the family.  I still quote this film without even thinking about it and even do impressions in my radio work simply because I got confident doing them thanks to Rich's influence in my early age.  His Christmas special is kind of etched in my brain and I thank Rich Little for producing this and making it a little easier to bring some magic back into this time of year.

As for this release, I'm a little disappointed since 2 separate copies have had problems with skipping on Robin Hood.  It's watchable...  Luckily there is no skipping on Christmas Carol, and even at a younger age I never considered Robin Hood Little's best work.  It almost qualifies as passable.  Still, it's nice to have it here.

I have yet to watch Robin Hood with the commentary, but I just got done with Christmas Carol commentary and found extremely insightful.  There's a lot of fun facts...although the director sounds like he's reading someone elses comments from a cheat sheet, it's all good info.  Rich is often critical of his work, particularly about what he did with the Inspector Clouseau ""Christmas Future"" impression.  I couldn't see it being done any other way.  The shouting helps to make it funny, Rich!  Just like the 6 fingers of Jack Benny. Still, it would be great to see (or hear) Little do this whole thing differently.  That could have made some delicious extras, the record album, Sullivan and stage clips. ...if available, that is.

Anyway, a good value I think.  Except for the flaw (that brings the product rating down substantially in my book since it happened on my first purchase and on a replacement the store sent me) and the mediocre Robin Hood followup.  Still, I'm happy to replace my old tape (that we got from a going out of business sale at a video store) with this DVD.  The quality looks better than expected (people complaining here on amazon, but seriously...this is what 70s TV should look like).  I'm happy there was a halfway decent source copy to use.

REVIEW

Overflowing with creativity and the expected cultural references in a Rich Little production, ""Rich Little's Christmas Carol"" stands apart from the mass of both traditional and non-traditional tellings of the Dickens tale.

In an amazing performance, Rich Little plays every single major character in this production.  I still shake my head in awe when I think about it.  He plays the characters through a couple of prisms, as well.  He is projecting his performance through Dickens' classic characters as well as through various cultural figures.  For instance, here one gets Rich as Bob Cratchit projected hilariously through the persona of Paul Lynde.  Additionally, there is Rich in drag to give a very humorous impression of Edith Bunker as Mrs. Cratchit.  At the head of Mr. Little's long list of cultural references, he gives us W.C. Fields as Ebenezer Scrooge.  This is the single best inspiration for a character in this production.  It references Mr. Fields' legendary sourness and his famed actual appearance in a film adaptation of what is arguably Dickens' other most famous work, ""David Copperfield.""

If I had a qualm with this production, it would be that it was filmed in the late 1970's, and thus many of the references that were fresh then have lost their cache, and thus their humor.  However, it is still very worth seeing for Rich Little's wonderful virtuoso performance.",1264982400,5,1629,5.1915708812260535

This was when everybody was fully stocked. After looking into why they wouldn't give me a confirmation of shipment ... turns out they never shipped it!! They knew it was going out of stock they knew they could sell it at a higher price than the 11.95 I paid for it. These as*h*les give capitalism bad name! I wish I had ordered it from Amazon. At least I would have received a confirmation. I definitely got "" scrooged"" by DVD PLanet. Caveat Emptor!!",1261526400,,586,4.59047619047619
2726835,1,B000M7FSSA,"I ws delighted to find this DVD, which I had been looking for for years, but very disappointed to discover the copy I had been sent was defective. I shipped it back, which cost double what Amazon allowed me for return postage. When I got the replacement, it was also defective. I gave up. Why throw good money after bad? Obviously the whole batch in Amazon's stock is defective. Ned I say more?",1260316800,3,394,4.410958904109589
2726836,3,B000M7FSSA,"Rich Little's Christmas Carol is worth the DVD! It has been a favorite of mine for years. Having it in DVD format is a real plus; no longer do I have to worry the VHS Tape would wear out, and the images are clearer. This is an excellent presentation. Little's characters are believable and recognizable, especially if you knew them in life. The impersonations are structured around the story of A Christmas Carol. As for Little's Robin Hood, it was a big disappointment. There is not a good story; impressions are not well carried out; and it is a bit corny. It clearly is not the same quality presentation as the Christmas Carol. These two items came together; getting the Christmas Carol is worth the expense.",1234656000,,711,4.650793650793651
2726837,3,B000M7FSSA,This was a classic routine from Rich Little. It was a little tuff to watch old TV again because it was so simple. But it is a classic so I like owning this version.,1232409600,,164,3.8529411764705883
2726838,4,B000M7FSSA,"I saw Rich Litttle's version of A Christmas Carol many years ago on HBO and A&E, and although I did tape it on VHS it eventually wore out.  I happened to see the DVD when I was Christmas shopping for myself.  I have always enjoyed Little's Christmas Carol, but after watching his version of Robin Hood I thought it was a load of crap.  While I have often read the legends of Robin Hood many times, even allowing for the fact that it was supposed to be funny, this version of Robin Hood got dumb real fast.  I highly recommend purchasing this DVD for the Christmas Carol, but I would strongly recommend that you either don't watch the ""bonus"" feature, or only watch it once, and after that stick to the Christmas Carol.",1231113600,,718,4.37593984962406
2726839,5,B000M7FSSA,"Ah, the Rich Little Christmas Carol special. I used to watch this every year on HBO beginning when I was a six years old. Even then I had the vague feeling that these were cornball jokes a little past their due date. My wife's description of Rich Little says it best: he really doesn't do impersonations any better than your average suburban dad could do. I mean, really, does Johnny Carson really go ""Aaaww"" so much? Was Bogart ever that tickish with his lips and teeth? Still, I have as much fun watching this each year because, darn it all, it DOES seem like something my dad could do just as well, and Rich Little seems to be having so much fun trying to do it. (Trying is the operative word: he doesn't always succeed, but you love him just the same.) It's like watching a home movie, and loads of fun. (I haven't watched Robin Hood, and who knows if I ever will?) Lots of fun!",1229385600,,882,4.287425149700598
