8572028,2,B00BOYLV36,"I was disappointed in this movie>not anywhere near as good as ive come to expect out of South Korea,.Ill say one thing though. They definitely make the best movies nowadays. This one is not one of them",1424736000,,201,4.45945945945946
8572029,4,B00BOYLV36,"- this was an interested movie. i was suspicious of one of the characters in the beginning, so it was no surprise when in the end my suspicions were right although it still kept me guessing since there were a bit of doubt. one thing for certain i am curious to know what happen to that said character in the end, are they still on the island or did they get away. i guess we have to leave that to our imagination.",1420329600,,413,4.048780487804878
8572030,3,B00BOYLV36,"Interesting movie, good enough to keep my attention but not one of the better ones I've seen.",1413936000,,93,4.529411764705882
8572031,5,B00BOYLV36,"Wow a great movie!
Horrifying and terrifying yet dramatic change of phase at the end.
17 murders involving among each other, excruciated by witnessing the true savageness of human traits in the good, the bad, and ugly manners, which all driven by modern science in the form of medicinal development.
After all human mind can't be controlled by dosage of drugs, no matter how the cause behind is philanthropic.
Another good lesson why you should not be indulged by drugs.",1410480000,,470,4.8875
8572032,5,B00BOYLV36,"Great well filmed mystery that keeps you guessing until the end. The story was unique and each character was given time to tell their part.
The acting was superb. I must give it the highest rating because I enjoyed it so much.",1402012800,2,226,4.404761904761905
8572033,4,B00BOYLV36,"Movie is set on a small island with a very limited cast of characters. It reminded me of Agatha Christies ""And Then There Were None."" Really good cinematography. Each character was well written and well acted. I watched the entire movie without thinking that there must be something better on. Not many movies can hold my attention for the whole movie. It's great to see the quality of movie making that is coming out of Korea these days. Western film makers could learn something from them.",1396137600,4,491,4.72093023255814
8572034,4,B00BOYLV36,"Korean cinema rivals the best that film has to offer all around the globe. Not to mention, their extremely active and creative television industry.  Paradise Murdered is an excellent mock-horror-suspense, with depth of character, witty humor and stomach, cramping laughs.  I give it an A- thumbs up nod, for total originality, brilliant scripting and primo acting.  It will not bore, and is a must see, even for the too-lazy-to-read-subtitles folk, who might end-up finding the extra work worth while.",1394928000,,501,5.3164556962025316
8572035,3,B00BOYLV36,I did enjoy it... It's a little drawn out... kinda slow for a while. There are definitely a few funny and creative moments. Overall though... it's just alright.,1394928000,2,160,4.75
