7447399,3,B015S4DRJS,"It's a bit impressive that the Friday series managed to go so long without a reboot; one of Hollywood's favorite tricks to jump-start a struggling series. Having endured more than its share of such hardships, the Vorhees saga no doubt deserves a fresh look, but this relaunch has no sparkle, no magic. It's just another generic, run-of-the-mill, nothing-special stalker picture with an iconic mask riding aboard the killer's forehead. Throwbacks to the original trilogy abound for careful-eyed viewers, but they serve no purpose beyond a brief flash of memory. Jason himself has evolved a bit, taking on more of a predatory, turf-protecting role rather than that of a mindless, knife-flinging abattoir. His presence is more tenacious and precise, too - less of the lumbering meathead we experienced in previous encounters - but he maintains an odd knack for the comically theatrical, with a special love for body-tossing and delicate corpse arrangement. Of course, his teen victims are as dumb and irritating as ever, though the SFX gore of their eventual demise has been largely withdrawn or relegated to off-camera insinuations. The setting looks great, and it's easily the best-composed Friday ever, but the effort is ultimately rather pointless and empty without adding something new to the mythos. Dull and overly long (even at a mere ninety minutes), this particular jump-start is a clear case of style over substance.",1478476800,3,1424,5.25

7447450,5,B015S4DRJS,"I binge watched every Friday the 13th movie recently. This movie was a breath of fresh air after how awful part 9 and 10 were. It wasn't super memorable, but it really captured Jason and the horror elements.",1503619200,2,207,4.473684210526316
8734463,4,B015S4DRJS,"Came on time, but had a weird hole in the corner of the box. It luckily isn't noticeable on my shelf, but I would of liked it to not have the hole.",1532822400,,147,3.625
8734464,5,B015S4DRJS,"I'm a little confused by some of the other reviews on here. I'm giving it 5 stars because I feel the movie executes exactly what it sets out to do, rather than giving it 5 stars in comparison to what would be considered a cinematic masterpiece, such as Blade Runner 2049.

The biggest criticisms are that the characters are somewhat flat, and the movie wasn't gory enough. The characters do well enough for what they are; meat in a slasher film. This film isn't trying to create deep characters where you develop emotional attachments to them, and then feel the pain when they're killed, because that's a bit heavier than what this film wants to accomplish. You're supposed to get to know the basics of a character, then cringe and go, ""Oooooh s*****!"" when they get murdered.

Second, people seem to criticize the fact this film isn't gory enough. Honestly? Have any of you actually seen how tame most of the other F13 movies are? The only one that was actually gory was Jason Goes to Hell, and that one actually made me shudder with how brutal it was at times.

Still, I'm not quite sure what people were expecting with this film. It's a giant man-child wanting people off his property, and going beserk. Just enjoy it for what it is.",1523059200,,1236,4.558558558558558
