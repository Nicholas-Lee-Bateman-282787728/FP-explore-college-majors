8398527,1,B003JV4RHO,These are all the episodes I remember loving when I watched this growing up. It's a shame I will never be able to afford the insane price tag. I give it 1 star out of sheer spite that whatever publisher that discontinued this has denied me the ability to relive my childhood.,1395705600,6,275,4.3076923076923075
8398528,3,B003JV4RHO,"I just wanted to write this review for posterity. Unless you have money to throw around, I would seriously not recommend the DVD at all, it's not worth the nearly triple digits now that it is out of print due to being an adult swim shop exclusive, and the shop closed last year. If you're a hardcore Space Ghost guy, you'll get it anyways, but then again you probably already did when it was $20 combined with Volume 5.

The episodes included are the entire fifth season, ""Terminal"", ""Toast"", ""Lawsuit"", ""Cahill"", ""Warren (extended)"", ""Chinatown"", ""Rio Ghosto"", ""Pal Joey"", ""Curses"", ""Intense Patriotism"", and ""Waiting for Edward"". For the most part, the episodes are great, finding a nice balance between the previous seasons wit, and the insanity that would come later. There are a few episodes that aren't as good as others, like ""Cahill"" (but the fair ending is one of the best Space Ghost endings of all time), and ""Waiting for Edward"" (it's the shortest episode in the collection and still eats up a minute and a half of time with the Waiting screen) but most of them are as funny as the previous season and the seasons that came after. I also noticed ""Cahill"" was massively edited when Space Ghost was nervously singing ""For the Love of Money"" with Garrett Morris. It's the only edit I noticed though, so still the least amount of edits on a Space Ghost DVD.

The presentation is remarkably terrible, which is great and all, but that was adult swim's gimmick for a ton of DVDs, and it's sort of old at this point. However, the on-purpose awfulness has been brought to a new level with chicken scratch writing on the menus, a crappily drawn Space Ghost, and eerie whispering in the background. I brought my copy to school once to lend to a friend, and another came up and thought it was some sort of pirated DVD. Soo, I guess adult swim did what they wanted to perfectly.

The video quality is about on par with the previous volumes, perhaps a bit better. It looks about as good as cleaned-up 60s drawings can get on DVD. The audio quality is regular Dolby Digital, which is most definitely serviceable enough.

The extras are a bit disappointing, but I can totally understand only including two, because I'd rather they fit two and a half hours of Space Ghost on one disc than have about two hours with a couple promos and commentaries. The extras are ""Dinner with Steven"", an alternate episode with the same Steven Wright interview as the one from ""Snatch"", which is on volume 5. It's rather interesting and funny, but it's not as good as Snatch. However, I still found myself laughing a bit, and unfortunately it's still in an animatic phase, never finished. The other feature, ""Kitties"", is insanely funny and cute. It's not even just a random feature, as it's a green screen shooting for the episode ""Chinatown"". It's fun, has quirky music, and again, it's a fun, upbeat extra. You can find it on YouTube if you want to see it. Subtitles and closed captioning are supported.

The DVD may cost over a hundred dollars and is now a collectors item, but it's hardly worth the money unless you bought it and Volume 5 for a mere 20 dollars plus shipping. Now you can sell it and make some major profit, or continue enjoying Space Ghost-fueled insanity. I'm picking the latter, at least for now, because I still love Space Ghost, and while this isn't necessarily my favorite season, that would go to the first disc of Volume 5, it's still staying in my DVD collection for the foreseeable future, as well as the aforementioned volume.
