8104912,4,B000E371ZA,"I had heard a lot of great things about this DVD and was anxiously anticipating watching it. I must admit, that although it was very good well made, and had many interesting nuggets of information, I came away a little dissappointed. I guess there was not a whole lot in the DVD that was all the ""shocking"" to me. More or less standard stories of an overcrowded undersupplied prison. I did find it interesting that they showed evidence of Henry Wirz the monster and Henry Wirz the humanitarian. All in all I still really liked the DVD, despite the fact that it did not live up to the hype I had heard about it. I would still very much recommend this DVD, as it was very entertaining and educational.",1184544000,8,699,4.426356589147287
