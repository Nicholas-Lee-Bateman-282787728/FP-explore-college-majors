8426935,3,B004EI2NPE,Not a typical romantic-comedy... maybe more of a typical French movie where everything feels a bit less perfect... not one of the movies that you watch when you want to just cozy up and watch a feel-good movie... it pretty much shows you what life can be life behind the scenes. Good acting... good flow...,1424736000,,306,4.581818181818182
8426936,3,B004EI2NPE,"This movie is not really French. It can't be. a French main actor who is always sad and sulking and hardly smile. Non, he was too happy to be an authentic French actor. Ok, now for the truth: this French actor was so sad and despond in this movie that at the end one would feel depressed and sad - just like him. Other than that, the movie was entertaining and sometimes, fun.",1389830400,,376,4.164383561643835
8426937,4,B004EI2NPE,I saw this movie on Netflix; I enjoyed it so much I bought it.  Wish I could get the soundtrack; I liked the rap 'Gigolo'.  A good film; recommend it.,1337472000,,150,3.966666666666667
8426938,3,B004EI2NPE,"The film starts out as a ""saucy French comedy"" about a sophisticated businesswoman, played by the excellent Nathalie Baye, who hires younger men for sexual interludes while her middle aged sister hooks up with an American Indian. So far, a comedy. However, the director Balasko (who plays in the movie as the sister, with her real life husband as the Arizona Indian and her own daughter as the teenager) seems not to have been able to decide what kind of movie she was making. A third of the way through, she abandons comedy and the story morphs into a more serious drama about a French middle class family under severe financial stress, the heartrending breakdown of the gigolo's marriage when his secret is revealed, a disfunctional teenage girl, and the beginnings of a desperate love between escort and client as it all disintegrates. The viewer struggles to adjust to these changes in tone.

Baye is the strongest character as a selfish, independent older woman who knows what she wants. Eric Caravaca as the gigolo does not seem to fit the part at all, more wimpy than sexy; I would find him more believable as a middle school math teacher than a bad boy. Their physical relationship seems devoid of passion, nor do they spark an emotional relationship. Film has good moments but overall suffers from poor architecture.

Also Ms. Balasko centered this too much on her real life family; it's a vanity piece or even home movie. She seems a better actress than director.",1302480000,2,1473,4.7952755905511815
8426939,3,B004EI2NPE,"the premise seems designed to be shocking - like Baye's UNE LIAISON PORNOGRAPHIQUE (hard to believe that got translated into ""An Affair of Love"", eh?) - but Nathalie Baye gives an extraodinary performance in this one - yet she just barely rises above this superb cast of actors

she plays an aging love-cynic who pays for the transient attention of young men who advertise on the Internet - except - she seems drawn to the latest one

for me the story doesn't get going until quite a ways into the film when the young man's wife finds out about his second job

the wife is played by the lovely Isabelle Carr - the prostitute/husband is well played by Eric Caravaca - whose only weakness is a lack of chemistry with Baye

writer/director Josianne Balasko appears as Baye's sister - her role provides the contrasting love story as she falls for an Apache Indian from Arizona - well played by George Aguilar - Balasko's real-life husband

naturellement - my rating is biased by Nathalie Baye's presence",1302220800,,999,4.685714285714286
