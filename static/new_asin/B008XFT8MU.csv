Hugh Laurie is and outstanding pianist who is in love with the Blues, New Orleans style. In this hour, he seeks out some of the best musicians there, both instrumental and vocalists. I have played this at least a dozen times in the short time that I have owned it. A surprise guest artist is Sir Tom Jones who performs and compliments Hugh by saying that he didn't copy anyone as he is an accomplished musician in his own right. This DVD is best viewed with a glass of good bourbon on the rocks.",1367366400,,597,4.155172413793103
