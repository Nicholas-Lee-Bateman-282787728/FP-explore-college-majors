4464910,5,B004SZVYD0,"Fine, original movie. The story was good, but still they could do a little better,longer of an ending. But it's worth getting. People found the way to bring ancient creatures back to life. But as with them, they brought to life a men-turning to beasts, virus. People almost extinct and they are fighting for their survival.

4464913,4,B004SZVYD0,"This movie adaptation of a ""re-genesis""  of mankind seems more realistic than "" Man to Zombie regenerating back to civilization again"" has more flavor than the usual ""same theme; same plot, same actions"".

This movie is more realistic.",1462406400,,235,5.157894736842105
4464914,4,B004SZVYD0,"First of all, this movie is incredibly sexist. They have no fight, don't show much intelligence, and are all dressed like ragged hookers. Secondly, there are too many scenes where too much has been cut out. There's a fight scene where one guy is fighting like crazy and the very next second he's lying dead by a river. How did he die? How did he get to the river? What is the point of the scene at all? So there is some bad editing. My final criticism is that the music is too often out of sync with what is happening. There was one scene with a drippy background noise in the music that actually had me checking the kitchen faucet to see if it were leaking (was watching the show at the kitchen table). Other than that, the plot is usually fairly sensible, the progression of the plot is fairly logical, and, while the writing is not spectacular, the actors do a generally good job of their lines. It is movie I might even watch a second time, especially because Sean Bean is in it. And it is because of Bean that I gave 4 stars rather than 2 or 3.",1461196800,5,1049,4.198019801980198

4464925,4,B004SZVYD0,"I would love to give it a 5 star - but there were moments that seemed a bit shallow.  Sean Bean never disappoints! The actor portraying the learned reader hero of the isolated tribe - was quite good, as well. The rest...meh! good enough for the movie - no real horrible actors except the villain and his daughter.  The villain character was in my opinion just pathetic and somewhat laughable. The villain's daughter's character was too ready to give in - I'm glad she was where she was (gives me hope for humanity - so to speak) but for the purposes of believe-ability - I think her part in the plot was so they could reduce the amount of money spent in film making. I would have enjoyed some stretch in the that part of the movie - they could have lengthened the time it took to become turned - in order to achieve more movie plot time in the city. Otherwise, I really enjoyed it immensely - and really thought it was a very good spin of a dystopian future.",1431043200,,958,4.287292817679558

4464943,3,B004SZVYD0,"This is definitely not an original idea; post-apocalyptic storylines have been around forever.  In this particular case, all the `supposed' cave-dwellers are just a bit too pristine and GQ in their fancified ragtag garb artfully created by a designer.  In record time, we're instantly introduced to one tribe trying to exist on nuts and berries and the occasion stray GIANT sloth.  Their greatest enemy is a band of infected people they call the beasts (they're just misunderstood mutants).  They are spied on by Amal (Sean Bean), who had some acquaintance with the father of two of the cave-dwellers.  The dead man in question just happened to have created the only known cure for the dreaded `beast' disease.  At that point in time, the son of said dead guy is the only person on Earth who can still read and therefore recreate the antidote (known as formula yellow powder).  Naturally, that calls for a quest to the BIG city.  Will they reach the city in time, will they find enough yellow powder left to cure their tribe, will their one and only reader be able to reconstruct his father's formula!!!

The main problem with this tired worn-out sci-fi flick is the overly familiar plot that's rushed to an unsatisfactory conclusion.  It feels as though bits and pieces of the story were jettisoned along the way due to time constraints.  Characters and plotlines were dragged in at the last minute then never properly dealt with before being abandoned.  They definitely tried to accomplish too much given their obvious limitations.  Still, it is watchable and entertaining enough and Sean Bean's presence tends to anchor some of the fly away aspects of the story.",1408147200,,1665,4.9035714285714285

4464953,1,B004SZVYD0,"I didn't like this film at all, I barely managed to finish watching it and I am really sorry that I bought it. Below, more of my impressions with VERY LIMITED SPOILERS.

This film was made for Syfy TV and is a post-apocalyptic SF story about a small tribe of humans, struggling to survive in a country of wild forests and marshes when avoiding mutant beasts which carry a horrible disease. With time most people forgot even how to read and write and as the result of all the hardships the memories of once powerful human civilization are fading. But one day a small ray of hope appears with news that somebody may have found the cure for the disease...

With just a minimum effort to improve dialogs and character development this could be actually a good story - but sadly this effort was not made. Characters are barely drafted and stereotyped, dialogs are very poor, there is no humour, acting is wooden and Sean Bean (unlike what is suggested on the cover) appears only briefly. There is only one reasonably good scene, in which tribal people hunt a giant mutant sloth - and that is all. All the rest is total ""Bantha pudu"" as Jabba the Hutt used to say...

I threw away the DVD immediately after watching it, as I don't think it was worthy even giving away for charity sale. I lost my money (OK, not much, I bought it used) and especially one evening I will never get back. Don't make the same mistake and AVOID this thing as deadly plague carried by giant mutant sloths...",1389312000,,1478,4.466666666666667

4464979,5,B004SZVYD0,This was a well done movie and a surprise that it has not made more of a splash as a surviavl movie. It takes up several generations after the end of our society. The plot rotates around the implyed end of society that was done in by some type of  plague. Society is fragmented and formed into tribes and the ability to read has been lost which seems to be an underlying issue to the whole of the story line. It was an entertaining plot that kept me gussing as to what was going to be the end of the story which is what I like. I was not able to second guess the ending. Which I often do.

4464981,2,B004SZVYD0,"I love my science fiction, but this fell far short of creating a very interesting movie to watch. The cave scenes were poorly managed and I think some more could have been done with trying to build the story between the ""beasts"" and those that were trapped in there. The rest of the story moves slowly and just does not come together that well. This amazing elixir and and how it was created seems plausible, but when the son struggles to read a book I found it difficult to build a realistic relationship between how he could be a replacement as the person to help the future.

It was just too far fetched and the movie did nothing to support that theory. Other than that you still wanted to know how the characters developed, but they just left you hanging to much that you could just not get into the movie that much. So if you are a die hard who just does not stop in the middle of the movie then watch and see. That is all I can say about that.

4465011,5,B004SZVYD0,"""The Lost Future"" (2010) is definitive proof that TV films can rise to greatness. It's a sci-fi/adventure hybrid in the spirit of ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Beneath-the-Planet-of-the-Apes/dp/B000E6ESDK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Beneath the Planet of the Apes</a>,"" but without the apes.

THE PLOT: In a post-apocalyptic world a small tribe of hunters & gatherers are forced to go beyond their normal hunting grounds to secure meat, which enables the ""beasts"" to find their village and attack. These ""beasts"" are actually diseased humans who are mad and zombie-like. Their disease spreads through bites, scratches or even breath. Three members of the tribe escape the siege in the hope of finding help from people outside their hunting grounds. They soon learn of a powder that can make them immune to the disease. Can they get the help they need and return to their besieged families before it's too late?

Although there are no apes, the similarities to ""Beneath the Planet of the Apes"" are obvious: Both films take place in post-apocalyptic societies, both feature people living in primitive conditions, both include human mutants, and both include hot cavebabes. The films differ in that their plots are totally different and ""The Lost Future"" has a lot more action; plus ""The Lost future"" - although completely serious - has a slightly more comic book vibe.

Some have compared ""The Lost Future"" to the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mad-Max-Special-Edition/dp/B00005R2IS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mad Max (Special Edition)</a>&nbsp;films&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Road-Warrior-Mad-Max-Beyond-Thunderdome-Double-Feature/dp/B000NA1WGS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Road Warrior / Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome (Double Feature)</a>&nbsp;but this isn't really true since there aren't any motorized vehicles or cops, not to mention it's more serious and all-around better IMHO.

Like the first two installments in the ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Planet-of-the-Apes/dp/B000E6ESEO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Planet of the Apes</a>"" series and all great sci-fi films ""The Lost Future"" addresses important themes beyond the surface story. For instance, the downside of religion is addressed: Religionists tend to turn inward and stagnate in the name of conservatism, while truth-seekers look beyond the limiting parameters set by the religious rulers (a type of legalists, like the Pharisees and teachers of the law in the New Testament). The false doctrines and flawed mentalities of the religionists may temporarily keep the tribe (or church or denomination) safe but they're ultimately detrimental since only the truth can set free, as Jesus himself declared (John 8:31-32). This is just a taste; there's more subtext, like selfless sacrifice for the greater cause.

The protagonists are all likable and honorable with Sam Claflin standing out as Kaleb, an underdog who rises to the challenge. An interesting side note is that Caleb in the Bible, along with Joshua, were honored by God for having a ""different spirit"" - a spirit of faith. This is the only hope for Kaleb's tribe in the film - the wild, bold faith it takes to break free of the confines of the religionists to find the truth and freedom, for him and his people. Corey Sevier and Sean Bean also have important masculine roles.

The film features two outstanding women: The breathtaking Annabelle Wallis as Dorel, the main female protagonist, and the incredible Hannah Tointon as Giselle, who plays a significant role in the final act. Also worthy of mention is Eleanor Tomlinson as the precious Miru, Kaleb's sister who does her best to survive the cave-siege.

The film has a worthy villain with Jonathan Pienaar as the arrogant Gagen, who also doesn't appear until the last act. Since Gagen possesses the last of the immunization powder he also controls the remaining human populace. Unfortunately he's gotten used to his position of power and therefore isn't open to ideas that are for the greater good of humanity.

Another plus is the magnificent locations, shot in Capetown and Western Cape, South Africa, of all places. Outstanding job on this front. In addition, although this is a low-budget TV film the sets and CGI (like the giant sloth) are quite impressive.

At a lean 91 minutes there's no fat.

FINAL SAY: The low-ratings by other reviewers are totally inexplicable. Don't believe them. ""The Lost Future"" is an excellent modern sci-fi adventure in the spirit of ""Beneath the Planet of the Apes."" Although made-for-TV, It's a hidden gem in a sea of cinematic drek.

This film does not bring anything new to the dysptopian film genre.  Somewhere behind it I suspect might be a novel that is far better than the movie.  Interesting ideas are presented but not developed.  Mankind declines because it brought genetically cloned mammoths and other beasts into the world.  There are a series of guardians who trot around on horses and are supposed to protect people.  The son of a scientist must seek a yellow powder to cure the disease that turns folks into mutant zombie orcs.  Too many ideas subsumed by smashing and bashing action and too little development of the post apocalyptic world are the focus. We are asked to accept too many plot points like only one person in the world can read. This character has learned from a third grade text and is expected to do some Nobel level o chem to save the world.  The characters are poorly developed also.  Cardboard bad guys, big bobbed heroines, and plucky teenage cavemen abound.  My biggest question is ""How did Sean Bean end up in this film""...... Tax liens, alimony payments, or bad judgement?

4465019,4,B004SZVYD0,"I have seen many science fiction movies about future catastrophes and a changed world; IE Planet of the Apes, Logan's Run, and numerous zombie movies.  When one reads the brief story line, you know that it could be a ""stinker"" or worse.  It is about stone-age humans coexisting with mutant humans that were altered by a virus that went out of control in the past. The mutants are contageous and very ugly, violent and somewhat stupid.  Exposure to them turns humans into mutants.
  Knowing this, I rented and watched this movie.  I enjoyed it! The special effects were good. Sean Bean's role was believable. I watch Sean Bean movies because they are interesting with a lot of action.
  I did have a few problems with the movie, though.  There was a lot of detail and build-up at the beginning.  Once the quest was on, things rushed along, too fast.  The bad guy was evil enough, and apparently had the tracking skills of Tarzan.  The eye shadow was enough to make the guy appear to be an old rock star.  The deceased father that could read (and taught his son to read) invented the cure for the virus that turned people into mutants, well, that was a bit too unbelievable, since his tribe was using flint spears as weapons. (Where did the father learn to read?)  Other than that, I did enjoy the movie.  I am still searching for a ""stinker"" movie that Sean is in, but I haven't yet.  Sean picks his movies well.  Pardon me if I don't study the names of the many other actors and compare them to other roles they were in.  It is enough to say that they were good. I have found that Walmart and Redbox have many movies with great cover art and plot interest, but the movies are in fact, terrible.

4465023,3,B004SZVYD0,"'Future' opens with what appears to be stone age hunters desperately looking for food. The obligatory twist: The humans are remnants of our modern civilization, the haggared last few survivors of post-21st Century society.

In the storyline, science worked to bring back Ice Age mammals that had gone extinct. However, a horrific and completely unintended consequence was a viral strain that eventually became human-transmittable, a quickly evolving pandemic that infected most of the world's population. The new virus transforming the infected into strong, near-mindless cannibal mutants that continue to be infectious after being turned.

The remaining small pockets of humanity have squirreled away, hiding in deep forests and faraway lands - all in an effort to survive. They've long since forgotten the hows or whys, having reverted back to a primitive state; knowing only that they need to stay hidden. And even then, it isn't enough.

In 'Future' we follow the story of one of these small enclaves. Life alone is harsh, their numbers continually decreasing. Lack of food, the pressure of continually hiding from the freaks, and omnipresent fear have depressed their ability to procreate - it's only a matter of time before there are just not enough to continue. Unknowingly, their only hope lies from within. One of their young people, an outcast of sorts because he's a thinker amongst a tribe of hunters, the oddball who is relegated to menial and emasculating tasks. But his father, a wanderer and explorer, taught him the old ways; gave him the basic tools to salvation. All he needs is permission to go into the Forbidden Lands, past the point of known territory. To where his father went.

But just as the elders disrespect the memory of his dad and outright dismiss his quest -  mutants find their encampment. It's a blood bath as the orgres end up killing and consuming most of the tribe. The few that 'survive' the initial assault end up turning. The remaining clan are stuck hiding in a protective cave with no way out.

Can the young man, whom everyone believes is nothing more than a dreamer, find a way to save his people?

So-so entertainment with beautiful Eleanor Tomlinson, as Miru, deflecting the worse of the cheapness and making up for quite a bit of the stunningly predictable script.

Not sure what's up with Sean Bean who is the featured ""star"" of this second rater. As you can clearly see, he's prominently featured on the cover artwork. Unsurprisingly, he's only in a few scenes. Sean has been doing quite a number of these low-budget productions the last few years. Would hate to think it's a money issue, but then again, actors are people too.

Again, this was sufficiently entertaining as a B-Movie. And I critique films based, in part, in the market they're targeting. Therefore, with that understanding, it gets a nominal trey. Although, if held to a higher standard, it would merit a deuce.",1328918400,,2928,4.959183673469388

4465025,3,B004SZVYD0,"So, if you watch this movie, you won't walk away thinking that you might ever watch it again. You probably wont. However, for all its many flaws, it was still an okay movie. You probably won't regret the hour and a half, but you also probably won't remember it a month later.
As for the story, the overall premise is actually really cool. A virus caused mutations in the majority of humanity, turning them into mindless killers, and possible cannibals. Not unique by any means. However, the story is set several generations after said apocalypse. Surviving humans have mostly regressed to tribalism and have lost the art of reading and writing among other things.
However, there are plenty of ""why did that happen"" or ""why did they just do that"" or ""how did they even figure that out"" moments. For example, how did somebody in a completely illiterate world manage to figure out how to read or write. Why does somebody who defeated a powerful band of warriors wander off to be killed after a pathetic attempt to kill his killer? How does somebody walking manage to arrive at the same spot as a bunch of people on horseback only a few minutes later? There are plenty of those questions that will forever remain unanswered.
Getting Sean Bean to accept a role in this flick must have been an inspired moment for the director or producer. I cant imagine how they convinced him, but they did. That being said, even his role was uninspired (and he is one of my favorite actors actually).
Anyway, like i say, you probably won't regret watching this film, but you won't remember it for long.

The only person of note is Bean and all he has to do is have ""the look""; say a few lines and then pick up the royalties.

Most amusing were the mutants who at times had the ""walk like a zombie""; at times gallop like a werewolf; at times fly like a vampire routines going. Talk about touching all your bases. The producers tried to be cute clever for the first five minutes as the viewer tries to figure out the time period except that if you're sharp you immediately notice that the spear blade looks like a machine sharpened Yoshi or Kyocera ceramic knife.

Positive:
Good set, and some CGI, ruined city effects.

Negatives:
The quest to find the magic anti-mutant powder was cheap if not farfetched. The end of the movie seemed like the writers ran out of time, money or simply got bored.
The spoken language was remarkably grammatically correct for people who cannot read.
The usual fighting scenes between mutants and humans looked like cheap Hong Kong '70s martial arts.
Costumes looked like store bought tailored but polished fake leather.

8440354,4,B004SZVYD0,"Well, I was pleasantly surprised. Sean Bean, of course, can do not wrong but his part in this isn't very big. We have a possible future for the human race which includes ""beasts"" men and women mutated into some king of savage beast (not a far stretch) If they bite, scratch or breathe on you, you will change too. There is a cure though created by the ""thinker"" of the cave bunch. Sam Claflin. It is up to him and Corey Sevier, the alpha hunter guy and his lady fair to get the cure and bring it back to his people who are trapped in said cave by a bunch of Beasts. If I am making light of it, that is not my intention it is just that I did enjoy the story and the acting is very good too. There are a few slow parts and they are kind of necessary to the story development. As I said this is a good way to spend an afternoon, check it out, you won't hate it.",1487030400,,858,3.9085714285714284
