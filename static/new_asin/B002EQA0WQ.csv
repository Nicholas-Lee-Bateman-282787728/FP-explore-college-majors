I watched it first on the Jewish Channel on Comcast ""On Demand"" TV, and had to rewind it many times while I was watching it, because I didn't want to miss one single word or subtitle, it is that good.  I was literally hanging on every word. I especially loved the way science, religion (from several perspectives) , history, politics, statehood, etc., were all put together and analyzed as a whole.

8410906,5,B002EQA0WQ,"A fascinating documentary made in the Holy City, Jerusalem. Most of the film focuses on what Kabbalah Jews believe about how the world and universe were created and how it compares to the Christian Bible and Muslim teachings. As part of the creation explanation, there are those that believe there is a ""foundation stone"" from the original creation that is now covered by the Muslim Dome on the Rock, built on the site of the former Jewish Holy Temple according to the Jewish people. The Muslims claim the temple was built further away from that site and that this site is where Mohammed ascended into heaven. Both sides believe that the foundation stone is a point of contact to God and a focal point in the creation.  For many of the religions across the world, this is an important site. Christianity believes that Jesus taught in the Holy Temple on this site. Abraham, the ancestor of all Jews through his son Isaac, and all Muslims through his son Ishmael, is said to have led Isaac to the sacrifice at the site the Jerusalem was built on many generations later. King David chose the site of the temple, his son King Solomon is the one that actually built the temple. The documentary explores the alleged attempt by the Jewish underground to destroy the Dome to clear the way for the rebuilding of the temple. It does have footage of the Foundation Stone in the documentary. There is a belief in several religions that when the Holy Temple that was destroyed by the Romans about 70 years after the death of Jesus, is rebuilt, the end of the world is at hand. Also featured are experts and religious leaders from the Jewish, Christian/Catholic, and Muslim faiths.  And there are architects, physicist, and a Quantum Mechanics Professor, who help explore the issue at hand and explain how various creation beliefs relate to theories by Alfred Einstein and other scientists.
The version sold here at Amazon.com has English subtitles which are well done and useful, as the experts that appear in the film speak a variety of languages. There are a number of reasons I enjoyed this 94 minute film. The experts are very sincere in their beliefs and know their subject very well. The quality of the Holy Land pictures and the colors were stunning. The graphic animations and special effects used to explain different theories were top knotch. The music was well done. All together I enjoyed seeing it and I recommend.",1264982400,3,2414,4.745238095238095
