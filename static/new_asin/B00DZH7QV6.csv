THIS movie however, well, you would think the powers that be would have continued the story, but this has no connection to any of the previous films. I've seen better from the cheaply made hack Sci-Fi crapfest of the week movies.
I really was expecting more. My own fault for trusting 'direct to Blu-Ray' films.

The new movie has Charley Brewster, Evil Ed, and Amy Peterson in Romania, on an educational trip. The professor is a female named Gerri Dandridge. (The female vampire is the only connection I saw to the original Fright Night II.) This time Peter Vincent is the host of a paranormal investigation series that explores eerie locales searching for monsters. He also happens to be in Romania, filming a new episode of Fright Night.

While obviously filmed on a budget, the movie had some great set pieces and atmosphere. The characters don't have the great arcs they did in the original, but the movie was more suspenseful than I expected it to be.

Jamie Murray did a great job as Gerri Dandridge. While some of her performance reminded me of Chris Sarandon, and some of Colin Farrell, some of the moves she made reminded me of the Terminatrix from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Terminator-3-Rise-of-the-Machines/dp/B001I7SGR8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines</a>. My favorite performance though was that of Chris Waller who portrayed Evil Ed (this time out, Ed's last name was Bates). Waller played Ed somewhere between Stephen Geoffreys and Christopher Mintz Plasse, and was quite enjoyable. The rest of the cast was adequate.

There were quite a number of call-backs to the original, which I enjoyed seeing. I did miss the outfit Amy wore as a vamp in both of the other Fright Night movies, and the missing great line, ""Oh, you're so cool, Brewster!""

All in all, a solid entry in the Fright Night universe. The differences in setting and story made this enjoyable, suspenseful and exciting. Definitely worth repeat viewings for the Fright Night fan.

I haven't had the opportunity to watch the extras yet, but these include a commentary track and some ""webisodes"" of this Peter Vincent's Fright Night series.

5880099,2,B00DZH7QV6,"Talk about bizarre. Though billed as FRIGHT NIGHT 2, this direct-to-video film from 20th Century Fox is yet another remake of the original 1985 Tom Holland classic, just with the settings changed. Here, Charley, Amy and Evil Ed are in a high school program in Romania. Instead of Jerry Dandridge, we have Gerri Dandridge, a female professor with a taste for blood. Peter Vincent is here too, but instead of a horror movie host (a la Roddy McDowall) or a magician (a la David Tennant), he's a Ghost Hunters-like, would-be paranormal investigator. The movie plays out exactly as you'd expect -- same basic plot structure as the Holland original, but with more blood, less humor, and something of a road company cast that's not particularly engaging (though the female leads are attractive enough).

It's beyond strange that the director and crew commentary say they're making a sequel to the 2011 Fright Night, when the movie is actually a remake. The story doesn't acknowledge the earlier film (how could it when Evil Ed is back, alive and well!) in any capacity. There's some vague plot element in Charley and Amy's relationship that ""something"" happened to them before, but it's never spelled out, and otherwise, the characters behave as if it's the first time something happened to them (Charley and Peter have never met, for example). So, so strange!

Basically, though, the movie isn't terrible -- it's watchable, but nowhere in the league of the 1985 film or even the 2011 remake. Like a better-than-Syfy Channel rendition of the story, which for most fans, isn't going to be enough, though it's a passable timekiller if taken on its own terms.",1380499200,53,1649,4.928057553956834

Charlie (Payne) has been chosen to study abroad from his high school. Him, his best friend Ed and ex-girlfriend Amy are in Romania and are excited about the opportunity. When Charlie sees his new teacher (Murray) doing some strange things he tries to convince everyone what is going on. When nothing works he goes to Peter Vincent for help. I wasn't a big fan of the remake with Colin Farrell mainly because I thought the original was fun and more entertaining to watch. The remake just seemed flat and boring. I wasn't all the excited about watching this one because of that reason. Halfway through I was confused as to what this movie actually was. Since it is called Fright Night 2 I was expecting a sequel. This movie is really just another re-make, or everyone has very very very bad memories. The characters are all excataly the same. Charlie, his friend Ed, his ex Amy and TV star Peter (all played by different actors). Charlie sees a vampire...no one belives him...yada yada yada.

5880107,3,B00DZH7QV6,"Not at all a sequel, rather this reimagining relies on our love of the original Fright Night (1985) while offering a new perspective to our vamps origins.  Not very good, but moderately entertaining.

Director Eduardo Rodriguez (Stash House, El Gringo) does not get off to a promising start.  After a very direct-to-video opening vampire sequence, we meet a class of college students studying abroad in Romania.  Among them are Charley Brewster (Will Payne), his ex-girlfriend Amy (Sacha Parkinson), and his rude friend Evil Ed (Chris Waller; The Sleeping Room, Inbred).

If, at this point, you feel a glimmer of hope that this will continue the story of 2011s Fright Night, youd be wrong.  This is not Charleys continued story after surviving 2011s undead events in Las Vegas.  These are totally unrelated characters of the same names or, in alternate perspective, they are the same characters in a different universe reliving a similar chain of events as our much better casts did in 1985, 1988 and 2011.  In other words, this is really in no way a sequel.  More a reimagining.  And, as such, a most unwowing Peter Vincent (Sean Power) now hosts a reality Monster Hunters TV show and Gerri Dandridge (Jaime Murray; Dexter, Spartacus: Gods of the Arena) is a female Romanian professor of European Art History who engages in lesbian vampire sex scenes that feel more gratuitous than in the sexual spirit of vampirism.

This movie echoes some of the iconic scenes of the original Fright Night (1985)e.g., Charleys neighborly voyeurism and Eds encounters with the main characters. Our Gerri, much as 1985s Chris Sarandon, also takes every opportunity to let Charley livealthough I cant surmise why until it is blatantly explained to Amy (and the audience) in the form of some needlessly elaborate vampire blood prophecy malarkey shoehorned through the characters mouths.  And speaking of malarkey, blood and boobs is the name of the game here. There are silly over-dramatizations, drippy baths of blood, a heavy dose of gratuitous nudity, some messy blood spurts, nonsensically long strip club scenes, a montage of Charley freaking out, and a vampire battle royale as our prophecy unfolds before our lobotomized eyes.

We learn that Bram Stokers Dracula was a mix of Elizabeth Bathory and Vlad the Impaler.  Gerris play on Bathory was obviously nothing to the historic The Countess (2009)which was much classier than the blood-soaked boobs of this non-sequelbut Gerri (and Jaime Murrays performance) remains the best aspect of this movie.  The coolest parts involved her abilities to shadow walk (as in Subspecies and Bram Stokers Dracula) and using her bat affinity for sonar (which I don't even think Ive seen in a vampire movie before).  She looked sleek and sexy and, not that its a bad thing, but her vamp style reminded of 30 Days of Night (2007) or Blade (1998). The most redeeming scene (in its entirety) of the film was actually its comic-style animation flashback explaining her origins.

Most other critical elements failed.  All dialogue in Evil Eds scenes were bad, the action largely sucked (and I don't know why there were so many fight scenes), the CGI was obvious (an intestinal explosion and a gooey melting scene), Eds fake fangs were so bulky it muffled his speech, and the gore make-up (an eye gauge and Evil Eds melted pizza face) was really just so-so most of the time.  I guess they triedit just wasn't really enough for me.  Although Gerris final transformation was moderately entertainingand, for some reason, the latex monster had demon boobs!  Like an alien demon beast (that could have been from any random movie) with no clothesand boobs!  Whats with this movie and boobs?  LOL.

This movie had so much nudity (for a sequel to a mainstream movie, anyway), its trailer should have just been blood-speckled boobs and Gerri being a sleek badass.  This non-sequel is dumb. The premise was wasted on this reimagining and should have been used for a more serious standalone vampire film rather than a direct-to-video sequel (that really isn't a sequel) of a remake.  And while a few scenes and depictions actually had some heart, they were surrounded by so much drivel they were easily forgotten in the wake of eye-rolling stupidity.

But, hey. Loads of boobs, blood and badness mean that you could make a solid Bad Movie Tuesday evening with your friends. To be fair, knowing this movie is awful is the best way to enjoy it.",1504742400,3,4447,4.95822102425876

5880111,3,B00DZH7QV6,"So I decided to give the 2013 Fright Night 2 a chance.  I was feverish and needed a new horror movie to watch and besides, I wanted to see how well Jaime Murray (the Black Fairy from Once Upon a Time) did as a vampire because I love her girlish (original Dark Shadows' Angelique Collins-esque) giggle.

At first I was ready to heckle it, from the cheesy blue-green tint and an explosion at the one minute and thirty second mark but it fast improved. Unfortunately it started to deteriorate back to shlock value near the end.
First: this isn't really a sequel.  It's more like another remake.  A remake that unfortunately went direct to video while the 2011 version got a theatrical release.  I say unfortunately because... I honestly think this was (at least for the first forty five minutes or so) better than the 2011 version despite 2011's abomination of a remake having David Tennant (Even that couldn't save it).

This film was a LOT more respectful to the original 1985 Fright Night than the 2011 Fright Night.

The plot is Charley Brewster, Amy, and Evil Ed (as I said it's not the same continuity as the 2011 film, so yes, Ed is alive) have decided to attend college in Romania.  Their new professor is Gerri Dangridge (a female version of Jerry) is a vampire.

Much like the original Fright Night Charlie sees her taking victims from his window and at first no one believes him.  She follows traditional Dracula-esque rules such as needing an invitation to enter a home, but unlike the gutter trash version of Jerry from the 2011 film she also has a lot of Dracula's traditional powers.

Her shadow can move as if of it's own accord (I like that a lot).  She can leap great heights and probably even fly.  She can read thoughts and enter dreams.  She can stop a moving car and damage it, with her own body.  And she heals fast even from a cross impaling one of her eyeballs.  She growls and makes animal and insect-like noises.  Her powers put the 2011 Jerry Dangridge to shame.  She also has more of the charm you would expect from a traditional vampire.  Suave and seductive yet dangerous. I just wish that like the original 1985 Jerry Dandridge and 1988 Regine she could take bat, wolf, and mist form.

She keeps making animal noises.  Let her change form, damn it!

Also, much like how the original 1985 Fight Night suggested that Jerry Dandridge was really Dracula (at least in it's novelization), this film heavily suggests (actually it out right tells you) that Gerri is Elizabeth Bathory, which I don't mind at all.  She even has a hidden bathtub of blood in her flat along with a collection of clocks (much like the 1985 Fright Night).

There's a bit of a twist though that she has been searching, for centuries, for someone born on the blood moon (and still a virgin) whose blood can cure her of her curse.  So though we see her revel in predatory behavior and seem to wickedly enjoy it, apparently she does not actually like being a vampire.
The new Evil Ed is a LOT better than the 2011 version as well.  This Evil reminded me of the original, right down to the facial expressions and eyebrows.  He even has the laugh.  He felt like Evil Ed, like he studied the original.
And unlike the 2011 Jerry Dangridge, who idiotically lived in a Las Vegas suburb with foil over his windows, this version is in Romania and has UV filters over her windows, a very nice modernization that didn't feel low brow or trashy.
I wish I had seen this when it first came out.  It's not as good as the 80s version or even the 1988 sequel but it makes up for the 2011 Fright Night in it's own way.

This shouldn't be called Fright Night 2.  It should be it's own movie, stand on it's own, as it's own attempt at a Fright Night remake since that's what it actually is.
This version deserved to be more than a direct to video sequel to the 2011 film.  Unfortunately it does have it's flaws...

The new Peter Vincent is a TV host for a cheesy Syfy Channel style monster hunting reality show.  I'm glad he has a TV show again but he's still disappointing.  He's too much like the 2011 version.  I miss the timid horror host who finds his place as a real monster hunter like Roddy McDowell's Peter Vincent.  Becoming the hero he always wanted to be.  The way the 2011 and 2013 Peter Vincent is tackled is all too cynical.

Amy's a bit stand-off-ish and keeps ignoring Charley trying to give her chocolates and flowers but I still like her better than the ""Hot chick"" version from the 2011 film that completely obliterated her Girl Next Door quality from the original 1985 film.

Evil Ed and Gerri Dandridge are fantastic and they make this movie!
There are parts in this that actually managed to make me laugh.  Nothing in the 2011 version made me laugh.  This should have gotten it's own theatrical release as it's own Fright Night remake.  It's NOT a sequel, it is its own reboot.  This should not be called Fright Night 2.

I miss the 1985 gay overtones with Ed being in the closet but this version of Evil Ed is fun just the same. Every time a vampire screeches and all through the chase scene and later climax there is a flickering light effect that I absolutely hate.  That's not scary.  It's annoying and potentially headache inducing.  The flickering lights during the chase scene are really annoying and unnecessary.  The scene would have been a lot creepier without it.  This is one of the film's flaws, falling back on modern tropes and cliches like this when it had the potential to be so good otherwise.  Skip the chase scene if you are prone to seizures or are photophobic in any way.

The chase scene and Peter Vincent are the biggest let downs of the movie but I love Evil Ed and I love Gerri Dandridge and her new array of powers that make the 2011 Jerry look pathetic in comparison.  I just wish she would take wolf, bat or mist form.

I also don't like that the vampires won't show up on camera, a trope lifted from the 2011 film.  Cameras never stopped Regine in the 1988 Fright Night Part 2, in fact part of the plot was her taking Peter Vincent's TV show and becoming it's new host.  Not showing up in a mirror doesn't necessarily mean you won't show up on camera.

They should shed all trappings of the 2011 Fright night, the parts that tried to mimic the 2011 remake actually hurt it.  Though I did like when Peter Vincent claimed to have the weapon that killed Dracula and that he had found it in the props department.

The ending is a bit incoherent and has it that a mere bite will change you into a vampire and yet in the original 1985 Fright Night, despite the feeding decapitations we distinctly saw Jerry feed Amy his blood.

The stupid flicker effect every time a vampire screeches is really obnoxious too, during the chase and the climax.

 Despite it's flaws the movie was kind of fun.  I would give it a 6.5 out of 10.  Gerri, you deserved to exist in a better Fright Night.",1492646400,,6902,4.440731901352426

So you have a very good actress in both looks and style playing a dangerous vixen who is often way over dressed or given well water thin lines when she needs to be seductive or intimidating.

Also as many have pointed out before me, this is like a reboot of the 2011 Fright Night story. Everyone is just learning vampires exist for the first time. It also fairly closely follows the story structure of the 2011 Fright Night.

The pace is bad, the story is clumsy, and there is some blood and nudity. The actresses are in general hot, the acting is decent, but the story and dialog are weak. I want to say this film really wanted to go the sexploitation route too make up for its many shortcomings but couldn't fully commit.

It's just really badly written... like someone got a 5 year old to watch the original Fright Night and then told them to write a  new movie script. There are giant leaps in logic and the entire thing seemed like it may have been edited by braille... truly an hour and a half I will never get back. The best thing I can say about this is, Jaime Murray made the most of a really bad movie.",1455148800,,779,4.193333333333333

Sound has all the right directionality, things coming at you right and left (and back!).

5880151,3,B00DZH7QV6,"The story of Fright Night 2: New Blood has some good points and some bad points. On the good, this film creates the elaborate melodramatic nightmare that manages to capture the gothic romance vampires in horror held in the 80s, very much like the original Fright Night and Fright Night 2 managed to create. For the bad point to this sequel, New Blood totally ignores everything about the Fright Night franchise except the characters names and that they are vampires. It really creates a weird frustration about watching the film. I found myself having to fight back the need to be pissed that Fright Night 2: New Blood had characters that where killed off in 2011s Fright Night and yet called itself Fright Night 2. That is a big fail when tapping into an established franchises mythos. Yet I found this story more entertaining and far more viable than 2011s Fright Night starring Colin Farrell. As a vampire film New Blood really does work and actually brings in a new vampire aspect that offers vampire and gothic-styled horror fans some thrills. It really is a much better film than it should have been and would have really topped my list had it just been Fright Night: New Blood instead of the Fright Night 2 moniker. The ""2"" forces a set, unwritten rule that the film should have respected. If they would have left it off then I would have had nothing but positive remarks for the film.

As for the effects and sound of New Blood, it is all really standard stuff expected in this genre and even gives a bit of a creative edge much like 30 Days Of Night pulled off in the world of vampires. There is no real hokey, or lame effects in this movie, save the dreaded use of CGI that one just has to tolerate in cinema these days. However the practical effects and visual aspects used in New Blood allow the film to flow smoothly enough to entertain. The sound effects and over all quality of suspense and chills work on a mediocre but acceptable level that doesnt really disappoint but isn't overly impressive either. For the most part Fright Night 2: New Blood is just a really good spin on a classic tale that manages to both s*** on a franchise while simultaneously paying tribute to it as well. For a good gothic vampire horror New Blood rocks, but it does walk all over the established story of Charley Brewester and Jerry Dandrige so be ready for it.",1432166400,,2357,4.532863849765258

5880185,3,B00DZH7QV6,"Going in, I had absolutely no expectations, even though I love the original movies. After all, this was a straight-to-video so-called sequel to a mediocre remake at best. Well, I have to say that while the film does have its flaws (lots and lots of 'how did he get there/get out of there' kind of moments), it's surely a fun movie, and I would even say that it's better than the theatrical remake.
As most viewers, I am puzzled as to why they decided to call this FN2, since it is *not* a sequel to the Colin Farrell movie. It is a remake of the original movies, in a way; or at least, inspired by them. I like the fact that the movie presents a few original takes on the story though. Having it set in Romania, amidst medieval castles, and the whole Elizabeth Bathory angle really worked.
I really liked the cast and characters: Gerri Dandridge, Evil Ed and Charlie were especially good.
All in all, I like the fact that it's not pretentious, it's not trying to be something that it's not... it' just a fun night out with vampires. Fine by me.

5880199,4,B00DZH7QV6,"FRIGHT NIGHT 2

The first two Fright Night movies have always been a part of my collection, the first is considered a classic by many. Then not too long ago a remake came out and it was surprisingly good in my opinion. So when I heard about this I was excited for it. I got even more excited about it when I heard that it was more like a reboot and close to the first two. So when it came out I had to have it so I was there to pick it up release day.

Charley, his best friend Ed and his ex Amy are all in Romania on a class trip. All Ed wants to do is have a good time but Charley is stuck on trying to fix his relationship with Amy. Upon arriving at their hotel Charley notices two beautiful across the street from them in another building. Naturally like any young male his age would he stops and watches them. Things are looking good in his eyes until his eyes witness something he never thought possible, one is a vampire and she begins to feed on the other woman. To make matters worse he thinks he meets the vampire at class later and she is the teacher. On top of that no one believes him and the Countess may be coming for him.

This was  a really good film that had all kinds of nods to the other films which was really fun noticing them. Writer Matt Venne [Masters of Horror, Fear Itself, White Noise 2, Mirrors 2, Bag of Bones] crafted a film that is a great nod to the others and the setting adds so much to it. It is about time  Fright Night film in Romania, makes perfect sense. The actors chosen for this film did a great job with Chris Waller even bringing back the eccentric Evil Ed back. But for my money it is Jamie Murray that steals the show as Gerri Dandrige or is that Countess Bathory. She is excellent as the seductress and is the best thing about the flick in my opinion.

Director Eduardo Rodriguez [Fear Itself, Curandero, Stash House, El Gringo] did a good job here keeping the film moving but at a nice pace. This is probably his best film to date and it was cool to hear him on the DVD commentary. You also get some behind the scenes stuff and Fright Night episodes from you know who. This is a great addition to the Fright Night series., theres an idea, a Fright Night series.",1397088000,2,2210,4.1160092807424595

5880201,3,B00DZH7QV6,"I love low budget horror, so i was willing to cut this film a break. But it's still pretty flat. I think the biggest problem is that none of the actors in key roles have much charisma, particularly the guy playing Charlie and his friend Evil, who spends the first half of the movie laughing historically at his own jokes. It gets pretty annoying. One new twist i liked, though, is that vampires can click their teeth together and cause sound vibrations, like radar.",1395619200,,465,4.5476190476190474

It's got the same characters and same story outline with a few references to the original Fright Night 2.  I don't know what the filmmakers or screenwriters were thinking when they did this film.  Why couldn't they have gone with a new story and adventure for Charlie and Peter like the original Fright Night 2 did?  Some new blood-sucking enemies they could have faced instead of the same old Gerry Danridge, who's a woman in this one.  This is the third time we've seen these characters in this story formula.

5880208,4,B00DZH7QV6,"When I saw this dvd, I debated whether or not to buy it.  Even though I am a big horror fan, after the 2011 Fright Night atrocity I was understandably dubious.  I checked some of the reviews for 2 New Blood here on amazon, and tried to find some like minded reviewers who disliked the 2011 version, liked the 1985, etc.  Those reviews were more positive than not, so I decided to buy this dvd.

Fright Night 2 New Blood is an entertaining, decently written, well directed and acted horror flick.  It's a legend of Dracula based on the true story of Elizabeth Bathory.  The aforementioned was the most prolific serial killer in history, with as many as 650 murders to her credit.  The legend goes that she used to bathe in the blood of her victims so she could maintain her youth and beauty.  The movie follows the legend, and picks up in the present day with her vampiric activities and agenda.  As with the 1985 and 2011 versions, the protagonists are Charlie Brewster, Amy, Evil Ed, and Peter Vincent.  The antagonist is Gerri Dandridge (read Elizabeth Bathory), a visiting professor to a college in Romania.  I don't want to include any spoilers, so I'll just say Charlie spots some unusual activity from Dandridge, investigates, and the rest follows.

The negative notes I have are these:  Some of the dialogue is a little goofy, and somewhat sensational, even for a vampire movie.

5880213,4,B00DZH7QV6,"So, I HAD to check this flick out (not on Amazon, but checked it out all the same) because I'm an avid Fright Night fan. The 80s original stands as one of THE best vampire movies of all time in my opinion. The recent remake with Colin Ferrell wasn't bad, but I felt it was more style than substance. This movie, on the other hand, was substantially better!

Like the other reviewers mentioned, it is NOT a sequel, but yet another remake with the spin of the lead vampire being a female. Though, she is not just some broad off the street as you will see; she's actually quite sinister with an agenda. Her acting as a menacing vampire was much more akin to the original Chris Sarandon where you actually felt intimidated. I didn't feel much from Colin Ferrell's rendition. This version had more atmosphere and that can perhaps be attributed to taking place in the Old Country as opposed to a new development. The fight scene was much better in here than the recent remake as well. Evil Ed was even played better here. I love Christopher Mintz-Plasse, but his Evil Ed was such an underdeveloped and generic character. The Evil Ed in this flick was more akin to the original Stephen Geoffreys where he's around for more of the film and is a sarcastic ass; though not very funny. I wish THIS would have been released and billed as the Fright Night remake and Colin Ferrell's just nixed altogether. My only complaint about both remakes is the diminshing appearance of Peter Vincent.

The only thing that stopped me from giving this movie five stars was that it was billed as a sequel. I just had a lot of fun watching it. Good gore, some nudity, and good vampires!",1390780800,,1658,4.504983388704319

I must say this movie did not even meet our low expectations !

5880219,1,B00DZH7QV6,"If only I had read the reviews first. I expected a continuation of the story or at the very least, an entirely new vampire with a new cast. This is neither. It is a complete reboot. That is not necessarily a bad thing if done properly but it's one of those movies in which the characters (mainly Chalie, the lead) do incredibly stupid things that no one would really do in real life.

He's a student starting a foreign-based European art study course and the professor is Gerri Dandrige. She's basically the same vampire from the original, only female instead. From the beginning Charlie is inexplicably allowed to see all the things that Gerri hides from everyone else including her feeding in public places.

There is one ""roll your eyes"" moment after another. For example they tour Vlad the Impaler's castle, where we learn that the vampire living there was female, contrary to myth. How convenient. Charlie separates from the group IMMEDIATELY to ""get some water."" The first corridor he walks down is dark and leads to a secluded hall where he sees her feeding. Right. Anyone who has ever taken a tour of anything knows that you can't just wander into private areas looking for water. He watches for less than a minute when someone taps him on the shoulder and says the tour is over and it's time to leave. I hope they all collected their refunds on the way out. Every scene in this movie is as stupid as that one.

If you haven't seen the original Fright Night, rent that one. It's about a thousand times better than this one. If you have seen that one, watching another where the characters who died are suddenly alive again in a so-called sequel is off-putting to put it mildly.",1388361600,,1685,4.591362126245847
5880220,2,B00DZH7QV6,"There good things about this film, but most of it is pretty lame.  It is a remake that tries to redo the original characters and rewrite the original tale by adding a more popular vampiress.

First, the actress who plays Elizabeth Bathory / Countess Dracula (Jaime Murray) is an excellent performer.  She is sexy when she has to be, charming when she has to be, and creepy when she starts turning into her true form.  Second, the settings were perfect for another Fright Night tale, but sadly underused.  Third, the idea to use Bathory as a vamp is a good one; they failed in the execution of it, though.

The slap in the face to fans of the last three movies was the fact that the writers/director tried to remake the film again with inexperienced actors and a lame vampire origin story.  You cannot replace Vlad Dracul.  You can add to the mythos, but never erase the original Dracula.  One of the charms of the original movies was that the vampire was just another mysterious vampire moving into town.

They even tried to redo Evil Ed!!!  The most creepy and unique best friend in any horror movie!  Who can repeat what the original actor did? (Stephen Geoffreys)  Probably no one.

There are no real scares.  A little bit of tension.  A lot of bad dialogue between Charlie and Evil Ed.

The new Charlie, Evil Ed, and Peter Vincent pale in comparison to the last movie's iterations.  They absolutely cannot come near the perfection of the originals.

On top of that we have a lame love story between Charlie and a girl who keeps brushing him off.  Ain't nobody got time for that!

5880222,1,B00DZH7QV6,"I was a big fan of the original ""Fright Night"" from 1985.  When the sequel was made a couple of years later I thought that was still good, due to the story and return of the main characters that made the first one work so well.

When the remake of the first 1985 film came out a few years ago  I thought that was a good update to the original story and worked well due to good casting, writing, and directing.

This mess gets everything wrong while trying to cash in on the  success of the first 3 films.

continuity:
I know that this is supposed to be a new story line.  But Evil Ed became a vampire and was killed in both preceding films.  Why give this dead vampire a second chance?

According to the accepted mythology, vampires stay young by drinking blood, they don't need to bath in it.  (Although some originality points are due for trying to bring the whole ""Bathory"" thing into the story).

I have been trying to watch this film for a while.  But I find it so bad I can't even seem to finish it.  The characters are very poor knock-offs of those it the better movies.

Now, I love the actress who is playing Gerry, but I think that was about the only thing I did love, or like, about this movie...
As my roommate described the movie: ""It's a soft porno version remake of the ""first"" one."" (From what I can remember, no sex takes place, but there's multiple naked ladies.)
Now, I can see how that could appeal to some, but I like my horror movies with more blood and less boobs. So, overall, not for me and I'll stick to my fun comedic-horror David Tennant version...

5880237,4,B00DZH7QV6,"Boy, I sure hate when folks bash a movie over stupid points like this really isn't a sequel.  Who cares, this was a fun movie.  So many times I've found folks being so freakin critical when it comes to reviewing a movie that they typically always give negative review probably because I think they get tired of watching movies and being impressed.  Falsehoods said by negative reviewers:  poor acting - not true at all, low budget - I was actually quite surprised by the special effects and especially the surround sound, very deep bass in many scenes, particular lowest was when car crahsed into the vampire and flipped over, truly low end rumble that shook my couch. Also some said it wasn't funny - what, did you watch the same movie.  It had funny moments but definitely more serious than the one done a couple years ago or two back in the 80's.

I agree with the positive reviews that said it was better than the Collin F. one done a couple years ago.  Also this movie was very entertaining with excellent video and audio quality.  It was more of a serious vampire movie that emphasized the evil more but still had humor.  It didn't follow the other movies exactly which is good, who ones the characters doing the same exact things.  My daughter liked it also and she isn't a vampire nut or anything.  It was a very entertaining movie that is nice to watch besides the ultra strange ones coming out lately.  It was gory but what do you want for a vampire movie.

As once again I've found, ignore all the negative 2 and 1 star ratings.  I gave it 4 stars for the type of movie it is and not for rating on best movie in general.  It was better than a 3 star.  One person said it was slightly better than a Sci Fi B movie.  This is way wrong.  It is much better than that and glad I decided to watch, truly entertaining and fun to watch.  Yes, there were a few holes that didn't make total sense to me but most of these type of movies have holes, it isn't the purpose to make total sense when it is a vampire movie for goodness sake.  I actually like this better than the 80's movie when wanting a very fun vampire movie with some humor and great sound and video.  The thought of 80's movies is fun in thinking, I watched Lost Boys recently as an example, but really don't want exactly this type of movie for this day and age, that's not going to happen.

Right off the bat we can see that it's not simply a continuation of the first film, it's a reboot and transplanted to Romania. All the characters are there, Evil, Charlie, Amy but Jerry Dandridge is now a female teacher, played by the alluring Jaime Murray. So it's now ""Gerri.""
Since it follows the original so closely, it is bound to draw comparisons but it's actually quite engaging and the cast work with conviction. Sacha Peterson (Amy)is no Amanda Bearse and I'm not sure about the diminutive Sean Power as Peter Vincent. Perhaps it's as well that his part in this film is somewhat limited - almost redundant, since the fight-the-vampire sequence at the end is basically a mnage a deux between Charley and Gerri.
There are some surprises there, too, enough to make it a little muddled and confusing for my part. And if only they could have spent a little less time in the swimming pool...As noted, the film is set in Romania, a location that is made very little use of since we're mostly inside or underground. Pity.
All in all, the film lives up to its illustrious predecessor (still a favourite of mine)and there is a really enjoyable comic book sequence.

5880242,3,B00DZH7QV6,"The 1980s had a shockwave of horror movies, from slasher sequels to zombie flicks and of course there is the 1985 horror-comedy Fright Night starring William Ragsdale, Chris Sarandon, Roddy McDowall and Amanda Bearse, followed by a 1987 sequel with McDowall and Ragasdale returning. Then came the 2011 3D remake starring Anton Yelchin, Colin Farrell and David Tennant, which failed to impress critics and moviegoers, barley making a profit. Two years later, 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment releases the direct-to-video sequel Fright Night 2: New Blood, which ignored the remake and is actually a new take on the original. Confused yet?

Charley Brewster, his best-friend ""Evil"" Ed Bates, and his ex-girlfriend Amy Lee are exchange students in Romania, where Charley happens to glance out his hotel window to see a woman biting the neck of another woman in the building across the street. At first he thought it was his imagination, but he soon learns the woman is his Romanian History professor, Gerri Dandridge, who he is starting to suspect is a vampire.

After a fellow classmate goes missing, Charley believes the professor has something to do with it. Later, Charley sees Gerri getting rid of what looks like a body. While she is gone, he sneaks into her apartment, but he has to hide as Gerri has returned. She is not alone as she brought a female prostitute with her, whom she drains and bathes in the prostitute's blood.

Charley barley escapes the apartment, but the police don't believe what he has seen, so he turns to his best friend ""Evil"" Ed and his ex-girlfriend, Amy Lee. They all believe Gerri is actually Elisabeth Bathory, the ""Blood Countess.""

I had mixed feeling about the 2011 remake, though it was watchable, it was also forgettable. Instead of making a direct sequel to the remake, the producers decided to reboot the franchise once again, with a lower-budget and a cast of unknowns. Fright Night 2: New Blood uses the same plot of the original, but only in a new setting, Romania. This time the vampire is a woman, similar to the original Fright Night Part II, but only using the real-life historic serial-killer, Elizabeth Bathory. I'm not the biggest fans of direct-to-video horror sequels (except for Curse of Chucky), so my expectations were low, but I'm glad to say that I actually like this version better than the 2011 remake. It follows the original plot more closely, but with a Gothic atmosphere and gory horror violence. Fright Night 2: New Blood is a great movie, but the only problem I have with it is the ""2"" in the title, when it clearly isn't a sequel.

5880245,2,B00DZH7QV6,"Good news: this is not a direct sequel to 2010's ""Fright Night."" That means that it wisely dodged the bullet that splattered the original movie's sequel.

Bad news: It's another remake, but cheaper.

Yes, despite the subtitle, ""Fright Night 2: New Blood"" is effectively the same movie as both the original and the remake -- right down to the names of the characters -- but with a gender-flipped antagonist, who is also the second most cliched vampire villain in the world. Jaime Murray's elegant performance is the only real reason to watch this movie, because everything else feels sleazy and mediocre.

A bunch of American exchange students have just arrived in Romania. Charley (Will Payne) spots a pair of attractive women making out (and is as piggish as you expect), but is shocked when one of them starts drinking the other's blood. He's even more shocked when he finds that the drinker is also his history teacher, Gerri Dandridge (Murray).

After spotting her dumping a body, Charley follows her -- and discovers her rejuvenating herself in a bath of blood. Yes, she's Elizabeth Bathory.

Charley's whiny ex-girlfriend Amy (Sacha Parkinson) refuses to believe that he's seen a vampire, but his best friend ""Evil"" Ed (Chris Waller) immediately jumps on board the vampire-hunting train. So they enlist debauched TV star Peter Vincent (Sean Power), who happens to be in Romania touring the strip clubs. And of course, it turns out that there's something Gerri wants from Amy.

Yes, this movie is not a sequel, but a remake with a much lower budget -- seriously, the star power here is that a lady who stars on a few SyFy shows is the villain. The names (""Evil"" Ed, Peter Vincent, Charley Brewster) are the same, the setup is the same -- really, the Romanian setting and the laughably fictionalized history of Elizabeth Bathory is the only new stuff here.

But while a lower budget doesn't mean poorer quality... this is no good. The entire movie feels very grotty and sleazy, as if everything is filmed through a thin layer of grime, and the dialogue tends to be a lot of tiresome unfunny jokes. You know you're in for a lackluster movie when the most intriguing, well-directed part of the movie is a MOTION COMIC.

It also is borderline exploitation, since the movie lovingly lingers on lesbian kisses and bare breasts for a comically long time. There's an entire scene set in a strip club, just so they could show strippers... and not even good strippers. It just makes the male characters look like pigs.

As for the acting, the only actor worth noting is Murray. She is a perfect vampire antagonist -- sensual without being skanky, elegant, intelligent and languidly manipulative. And yet, she still manages a few moments of vulnerability where we see how Bathory has suffered and lost hope, which almost makes you feel sorry for her.

That's something you WON'T be feeling for the other characters -- Peter is a sleazy creeper, Charley is a greasy little weasel, and Ed seems to be bipolar. Also, Amy is a whiny martyr who spends the whole movie obsessing on whether her boyfriend cheated on her -- which is never made clear, and isn't important anyway.

""Fright Night 2: New Blood"" doesn't have much new blood -- it just digs up the corpse of ""Fright Nights"" past and tries to shock it back to life. Give it a pass, unless you're a Jaime Murray fan.",1382313600,3,3361,4.757731958762887

5880251,2,B00DZH7QV6,"This is one of the biggest disappointments I've had recently, not because the movie was awful but because I thought I was purchasing the old Fright Night sequel (which I'm a big fan of) and ended up with a new straight to video sequel to the remake instead.  I guess that's what I get for ordering something before doing research on it first.  So how is the movie?  Well, it's a straight to video sequel--how do you think it is?  The basic story is the same as the others--a young man thinks someone he knows is a vampire but nobody believes him.  In this case the hero is a student doing a semester in Eastern Europe who discovers that his sexy art history professor is the real Countess Bathory.  The Countess Bathory is generally not portrayed as a vampire with fangs when she turns up in movies--if she's a vampire who drinks blood why would she need to bath in blood to stay young?  But for some reason the dopey script for Fright Night 2 tries to have it both ways--she's a fanger who drinks blood--but she also ages if she doesn't bathe in blood.  Whatever.  One thing the movie does get right is casting Jaime Murray as the vampire professor--she played a memorable Dexter villain (Lila) in season 2 and is perfect here, bringing a genuine sense of malicious delight to her character.  The rest of the cast is mostly bland but you could probably argue that they're just keeping with the spirit of the previous films--the hero and his girlfriend always tend to be the least interesting characters in a Fright Night movie.  The one bit of casting that is unforgivable though is Peter Vincent, here played by someone named Sean Power who is every bit as generic as his name.  While the filmmakers probably couldn't get David Tennant from the previous film Sean Power isn't even playing the same character despite having the same name--Tennant's version was a Vegas magician with an interest in the occult but the version on hand here is a third rate reality TV host who happens to be filming an episode of his reality TV show in Romania.  While the script and casting (except for Jaime Murray) leave a lot to be desired Fright Night 2 is handsomely filmed and unusually well-directed by Eduardo Rogriguez, who made the underrated Mexican horror film Curandero.  Fright Night 2 looks as good as a theatrical film--if only it had the script and cast to match.",1381708800,,2362,4.5928571428571425

So I went into it with a blank slate not hoping nor expecting for it to be anything like the Original classic at all.  I will say though I really did enjoy this part way over part 1 of the remake.  As it does take a different spin & was really well done.

He helped them in the first one, so how does he not know them? Did they all get amnesia? Really, the film is that bad. It's like they made a whole new movie with different characters, who happen to all have the same character names used in the remake. This movie is not worth watching, and surely not buying. I paid $13.99 for this stinker. It's not even worth $4.99 in my opinion",1381190400,2,738,4.316546762589928
5880257,2,B00DZH7QV6,"I have nothing against straight-to-DVD sequels to theatrical films. If a movie does minimally well in the theater and there's an audience for a lower-budget and less risky follow-up, I say why not? With that being said, sometimes it works and other times it doesn't. I actually enjoyed ""30 Days of Night: Dark Days"" and even ""The Scorpion King"" sequel and prequel. Unfortunately, I can't say the same about ""Fright Night 2: New Blood.""

Charlie Brewster, his ex-girlfriend Amy, and best friend ""Evil"" Ed are part of a group of high school students studying abroad in Romania. At the same time, ghost-hunting reality TV host Peter Vincent is exploring the haunted castles of the area. Charlie's professor, Gerri Dandridge, has a hidden motivation for teaching at a school full of teens. By night, she's a vampire searching for the blood of virgins to bathe in to keep her beautiful form. The bloodthirsty creature sets her sights on Amy and only Charlie and Peter Vincent can stop her from taking the essence of the new moon virgin.

Why ""Fright Night 2: New Blood"" is even advertised as a sequel is beyond me. It's more a remake of a remake, which is awfully (literally) redundant. Instead of the vampire antagonist being a male, this time around it's a female. To add even more insult to injury, her name is Gerri Dandridge versus Jerry Dandridge. Wow, how original.

The uselessness of this ""sequel"" or ""reboot"" doesn't end there. The characters in the film don't even acknowledge the events in the first ""Fright Night."" It's as if they never happened. Charlie and Amy are broken up. ""Evil"" Ed isn't a vampire. Peter Vincent is some loser who hosts a reality TV show about ghost-hunting and frequents topless bars. Yes, it really is as bad as it sounds.

""Fright Night 2: New Blood"" didn't have to be this bad. Granted, it had a lot going against it from the start. The original actors wouldn't or weren't asked to come back. Most fans of a film aren't very forgiving when different actors take the place of familiar faces. The straight-to-DVD route is also a point of contention and warning to many that producers and studios are just trying make a desperate cash-grab. Filmmakers of this sequel could have at least put forth some sort of effort to do something decent with this new entry in the series.

They could have Charlie, Amy, and ""Evil"" Ed studying abroad in Romania and Gerri Dandridge following them to exact revenge for the death of her brother. ""Evil"" Ed could be a vampire who decided to try to be good but still battles with his temptation for human blood. All screenwriters needed to do was switch up some dialogue and add a few different establishing shots of the characters. I can't see how it would have boosted the budget in any way.

""Fright Night 2: New Blood"" is rated R for graphic violence, gore, adult situations, nudity, and language. The 1980's ""Fright Night"" had a couple of scenes of nudity, but nothing compared to this. It's very obvious that the nudity in this film is used to make up for a lack of talent and for a weak script.

Being a huge fan of the original ""Fright Night"" and its sequel, I was very disappointed in ""Fright Night 2: New Blood."" I knew I shouldn't have such high expectations, and I really don't think I did. That's why I was so sad about my whole experience seeing the film. I had low expectations already and even those weren't met.

Very rarely do I come right out and say this, but avoid ""Fright Night 2: New Blood"" if you have fond memories of the 1980s movies and the 2011 remake. The only way anyone could like this is if they've never seen any other ""Fright Night"" movie and are looking for a low-budget vampire film to waste 90 minutes of their life. In that case, they need to pick up a copy of either versions of ""Fright Night"" and see what they've been missing.",1381190400,,3830,4.597364568081991
5880258,5,B00DZH7QV6,"This is a simple formulaic predictable film, which is one of the reasons why I liked it. It didn't try to be cute and clever, just took an old story and did it well. The film opens with a bang. We then move on to Romania where Charley (Will Payne) has girl friend issues with Amy (Sacha Parkinson) who doesn't trust him. They are there to study European Art History taught by none other than Madam Bathory (Jaime Murray) who needs the blood of a specific virgin. You can fill in the plot details.

Charley with his roommate seek the aid of TV ""Fright Night"" personality (Chris Waller) to help them, a man more interested in strippers.

This is indeed a remake. Jamie Murray brings to the screen a raw sexuality which made the film a classic ""B"" horror film. Our TV personality could have been done better and is the low spot of the writing. If you think of this as box office horror film, you will be disappointed, but as a ""B"" horror it is 5 stars.

This movie was better than the remake Fright Night with Collin Farrell. Period. Better plot, and ending and young new actors. the vampire was masterful in this. This film should have been the remake, it is not based on Fright Night 2 1988, it has it's own story. This movie makes the Fright Night remake with Collin Farrell seem cheap.",1380931200,3,577,4.452830188679245
5880262,2,B00DZH7QV6,"**IF YOU INSIST: SPOILERS**

You would expect this ""sequel"" to pick up where the Colin Farrell remake left off.  But, as the other reviwer stated, it is more accurately another remake, whose only borrowing from the original Fright Night Part II is a female vampire as the villain.  Annoyingly, therefore, you're forced to sit through the repeat of a largely predictable plotline:  Charlie sees vampire - Charlie accuses vampire of being vampire in front of others -  others don't believe him - vampire gives game away - others believe Charlie but knowledge puts them in danger - pursuit - pursuit - Charlie shatters windows - sunlight destroys vampire.

The writer(s) try to modify expectations somewhat. For instance, Charlie is Amy's ex-boyfriend, guilt-ridden from a vague infidelity he committed prior to their study abroad in Romania, where the film takes place.  Gerri Dandridge (so, not exactly Jerry Dandridge - but close) is both Charlie's (here) across-the-street neighbor and professor.  And Peter Vincent is the host of a Ghosthunters-style paranormal show called Fright Night (which Evil Ed loves to watch on his iPad), rather than an out-of-work actor of B-horror movies or a Las Vegas magician.

Not that these alterations amount to anything. Even the updated allusions to the original -- such as the scene where Evil Ed comes back for Peter Vincent after being made a vampire: except this time it's at a strip club, and this time Peter maims Ed with a tattoo of a cross on his chest, and this time Peter enlists his stripper cohorts to nail pages of the Hebrew Bible/Greek Testament to the walls to keep him safe until the sun comes up, and this time when Charlie comes for his help Peter checks he's not a vampire by taking a picture with his iPhone -- even these do not inspire a wonderful sense of nostalgia.  This direct-to-video Fright Night is distinctly unfun.

Add in the intriguing but pointless mystery of Gerri Dandridge being able to live in the sun as a vampire if she drinks the blood of a virgin born on a new moon, who turns out to be Amy.  However, once Gerri gets hold of Amy and does drink her blood you're still subjected to 25 minutes of tedious fight scenes before Gerri is fried to a crisp anyway, thus making for a pitiful non-sequel but standard direct-to-video fare.

The one star is for Jamie Murray who, in spite of looking like she'd really rather be back on the set of Spartacus, does the sexy vampire villain a little better than the script probably allows.  (The other actors were probably doing their best against the script as well, but it just didn't show.)",1380931200,7,2608,4.766666666666667
