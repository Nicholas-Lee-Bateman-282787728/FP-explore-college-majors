7850656,2,6303585817,"In the annals of erotic cinema, as with all types of cinema, there are always those who will stand out ahead of the rest of the pack. And one of those who would do so in this genre is the beautiful Rene Bond! ""Country Hooker"" is one of her earliest works. And while the material here is not the best, she certainly takes lemons and makes a very sexy lemonade with her performance.

The plot is about how a couple of musicians on their way to a gig pick up a pair of babes in distress (played by always luscious Rene Bond and Sandy Dempsey) and end up getting a very ""just reward"" for their kindness. Little do they realize they are soon to be the ones in distress, as these gals are pros being used to set the guys up for the whims of their pimp. When the girls end up falling for the guys, though, they all wind up in a heap of trouble that one of them won't get out of alive!

The film is a veritable ""who's who"" of 70's soft and hardcore porno flicks, as Bond and Dempsey are joined by several others well-known to sexploitation cinephiles, such as Louis Ojena, Maria Arnold and Bond's longtime boyfriend and co-star Ric Lutze. As with the most low-budget exploitation film offerings, the production and acting are pretty poor, save for Rene Bond and Louis Ojena (who plays Mike the pimp). Despite being an early work in her long porn career, Rene Bond shows she has a natural aptitude for the acting skills required, some decent comedic timing, as well as the ability to perform sexually in front of the camera. There is plenty of male and female full frontal nudity in this one, giving flesh fiends all that they could want and then some, and while most of the women are very nice looking, Rene Bond easily stands out as the most attractive of this bunch. She and her arousingly enhanced curves will never disappoint you here.

As for the actual script, the rape and murder scene is a bit shocking for the times. There's some really bad country music sequences, which are lip-synced by the guys, and some unintentionally humorous dialogue from the campy writing that will bring out more than a chuckle or two, but overall, the script and acting in this one just doesn't quite get over the well-endowed hump(s), as the film's ending, unlike the girls in the film, is totally flat as a board. Basically, it's main worth is to see the sensual Rene Bond in one of her early roles.

""Country Hooker"" might only rate as ""okay"" in the realm of sexploitation film, but thanks to the always sultry form and skills of Rene Bond you'll get a bit of fun and enjoyable mileage from this outing. Yee-haw, good buddies!",1392595200,,2609,4.440501043841336
