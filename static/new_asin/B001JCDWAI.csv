3657658,3,B001JCDWAI,"I purchased this DVD because I am a fan of Tokio Hotel but I have to say that I was a little disappointed with it, but only in the sense that it was too short. What was on the DVD was entertaining so maybe I am just spoilt by expecting DVD's to go for two hours, but considering the number of TH TV episodes to choose from I thought there would be more on this DVD. The DVD goes for just over an hour and has only 14 of the many TH TV episodes on it. There is extra footage of the band watching each episode that is included on the DVD and commenting on them which is amusing, especially with Bill and Tom trying to outdo each other. One thing that made me laugh was Bill saying, as they watched an episode, how awesome a particular outfit he was wearing looked and Tom saying it was embarrassing - that was worth buying the DVD for. The DVD is in German with English, French, Spanish, Cyrillic/Russian subtitles.

8312770,5,B001JCDWAI,"This is a must-have for any Tokio Hotel fan! Only words of caution are be aware that this does NOT include the bonus DVD. I was really disappointed to notice that only after purchasing it.

You get to see Tokio Hotel having a very funny (of course!) and relaxed discussion of THTV episodes, interspersed with clips of the episodes they discuss. It's very funny and a great way to get to know their true personalities.",1331683200,,417,4.56
8312771,5,B001JCDWAI,"THIS VIDEO IS COMPLETELY AMAZING. IT BRINGS BACK THE EARLIER DAYS OF TOKIO HOTEL BEFORE HUMANOID!!!

8312775,3,B001JCDWAI,"I was excited to get this in the mail.  I read good reviews and I've read bad reviews on this product.  I didn't really notice the ""OK"" reviewers that much, because I'm a huge Tokio Hotel fan.  After watching the video, first the product wasn't described well.  I thought it would have more then what's on the DVD.  I expected more of the different activities the guys did.  I actually expected that what was on YouTube would be on the DVD.  I was wrong! This does contain some of the videos; however, the guys add their commentary in it.  So yea at first it's exciting and fun to hear them talk about themselves, but after awhile you get tired of it.  You want to see them goof off and do whatever.  Another thing would be the camera work. HORRIBLE camera work.  I was almost getting sick with the jerky movements. . .It just wasn't a very good ""music"" video.",1251417600,,860,4.345911949685535
