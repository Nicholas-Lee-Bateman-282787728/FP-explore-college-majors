Along with Jhoon Rhee and a couple others, he is the face of tae kwon do in the western hemisphere and has taught more students than most of us have extended relations. Given this, it's no surprise that he's been too busy to make an abundance of films. ""Street Soldiers"" is his fourth and last movie made prior to the new millennium, and it's arguably also the least demanding for him, leaving most of the screentime to his costars. It's an entertaining adventure but not a great action movie, stuffed with enough cheese and ham for B-movie fans to enjoy and connoisseurs of taste to choke on.

The story: When their rivalry with the malicious JP gang grows deadly upon the release of its ex-leader (Jeff Rector,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Revamped/dp/B0010V4VIA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Revamped</a>) from prison, the young members of the Tigers gang turn to a martial arts master (Chong,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Silent-Assassins/dp/B000ES3JVU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Silent Assassins</a>) for training and guidance.

The list of absurd and unintentionally funny aspects of this film is long. Foremost, it's unclear whether the Tigers are supposed to be high school or college students; if they're the former, it makes the rival gang pretty weeny by default. More outrageous is the over-the-top performance of Jeff Rector; he's apparently going for an impression of Michael Wincott on cocaine. There is a number of entertainingly awkward lines (""You know, the Tigers can use a four-eyes in the gang""), and Jun Chong's character demonstrates some out-of-the-blue psychic abilities by being acutely aware when his nephew is being murdered. The movie goes for a half-hearted ideological approach in addressing gang violence, but loses all credibility when the protagonists refuse to acknowledge that their actions directly cause harm to innocent bystanders.

Nevertheless, the movie manages a feel-good vibe and is a colorful throwback to early-90s pop culture. The soundtrack is surprisingly great, with a song from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Benny-Mardones/dp/B000000CSW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Benny Mardones</a>&nbsp;playing over the credits.  This helps make the movie an enjoyable adventure flick, but the action leaves much to be desired. There are a couple of foot chases, but the majority of the adrenaline content is comprised of fistfights. For a film starring Jun Chong, there are surprisingly few karate matches; instead, there are plenty of mass brawls that aren't particularly exciting. Chong only has two full-length fights, and while his smooth forms are always welcome, his showdown with henchman Hwang Jang Lee (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Snake-in-the-Eagle-s-Shadow/dp/B00006672Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Snake in the Eagle's Shadow</a>) is disappointing and only a shadow of the show two legitimate tae kwon do masters ought to be able to present.

The movie is a technical improvement from everything else that Chong had appeared in, and is relatively good at building suspense. Given all these factors, it's easy to recommend the film for light viewing. Catching this one on TV is probably difficult, these days, but only bother seeking out the VHS tape if you're fairly certain this is your cup of tea.",1429747200,,3481,5.9959758551307845
7819710,5,6302009243,"OK if you have seen Ninja Turf or Best Of The Best and liked them I think you should buy this film like I have. Jun Chong is very good at Tae Kwon Do and makes all his kicks look very easy as the fight chereography has been done wonderfully. If you are a Tae Kwon Do person you'll love this. This is about a gang called  the Tigers who own the street that their high school is on. They thought they had a pact with another gang called The Pee Wees but it all changed when the leader of the gang goes to jail and the right hand man decides to get greedy and take back all the streets of the town! Jun Chong is a martial arts instructor and ex-mercenary has recently moved to this town to start a new life with his nephew Joon B Kim another great martial artist who ends up befriending the leader of the Tigers and saves his life during an ambush attack from the Pee Wees. However, the leaders friend who was with them is stabbed and dies, now its war! Joon B Kim turns to Jun Chong asking him to train the Tigers so they can defend themselves against the older gang. Awesome fight scenes with lots of explosive kicks from Tae Kwon Do and good training scenes as well.",1131321600,,1166,4.091703056768559
