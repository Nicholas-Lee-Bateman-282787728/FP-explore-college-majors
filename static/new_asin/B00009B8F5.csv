1882689,5,B00009B8F5,"This was an entertaining four hour series about the weather. It covers wind, wet (water), cold, and heat. Kinda like the Crocodile Hunter meets the weather. It is pretty good and doesn't have the ""typical"" BBC flavor that I expected. Especially good at grabbing the attention of kids as they learn. Fun for adults, too.",1111449600,8,319,4.818181818181818
1882690,5,B00009B8F5,"I'm a science teacher in California and have previewed in detail this work. For myself, I found the way Donal Macintyre organized the themes was ingeneous and caused the whole concept of weather to come alive to the point of being able to feel it and experience it in a powerful way. The fast pace, background music, true stories and historical background had a tendency to cause me personally to retain the details in vivid recollection

I'll be using this in my classes starting next week.

April 18th 2005:  Well, the jury is back and the news is favorable. The video series was able to hold the attention of active Freshman in high school. Congratulations to Donal and his production crew.",1099699200,68,693,4.710743801652892
1882691,3,B00009B8F5,I enjoyed watching this DVD but I had to run for other sources to satisfy my curiousity .Great to watch but don't expect it to answer all your weather questions.,1073520000,9,161,4.4
1882692,4,B00009B8F5,"This DVD is well organized into four sections:Wind,Wet,Cold, and Heat.
Wind; Covers twisters, Hurricanes , and jet streams
Wet; Covers Storms,flash floods, monsoons
Cold; ice storms etc..
Heat; deserts etc..
  As a tutorial on weather, this DVD is great, but it didn't have any shocking footages such as giant waves crashing over piers or roofs flying off by the power of a hurricane.  I found World Almanacs-Extreme Weather more interesting.",1066089600,35,442,5.285714285714286
1882703,5,B00009B8F5,Superb show! No distracting grunge rock soundtrack with over enthusiastic 18 yr old loudmouth host..great entertaining science and it treats the audience with respect. I have watched it twice and continue to take notes.,1424649600,,219,5.470588235294118
1882704,5,B00009B8F5,I enjoyed this movie teaches a lot,1408320000,,34,4.0
1882705,4,B00009B8F5,Good stuff for classroom. Any weather enthusiast would enjoy this DVD and high school or above students would learn and enjoy it.,1402272000,,129,4.909090909090909
1882706,4,B00009B8F5,"While not all the material fully explains the science behind how things happen on Earth, these videos are documentaries that are actually interesting to students. The stunts by Donal MacIntyre and the drama of personal experiences are a bit drawn out at times, but still entertaining. Also, some of the events are not very current or relevant today. Overall, a brilliant presentation that is worth watching at least once; arm-chair scientists and documentary watchers take note.",1400889600,,478,5.302631578947368
1882707,4,B00009B8F5,"I bought the entire 3 dvd set to help with online course.  Together, these help fill in the gaps the instructor does not cover and the TROUPHS the textbook leaves between chapters.  A HUGE HELP!",1392336000,,194,4.514285714285714
1882708,4,B00009B8F5,There are very few weather videos available for the high school level that are interesting.  Most of the episodes in this set are engaging. It was an excellent buy!,1375660800,,164,4.655172413793103
1882709,5,B00009B8F5,"I thoroughly enjoyed this series of shows. I have watching it many times over the years.
If you're interested in the planet and how things work, this is for you.",1358121600,,161,4.4
1882710,5,B00009B8F5,"By selecting the best educational visuals, I use it in my Marine Weather classes.  Particularly good animations of the circulation of the atmosphere.",1355702400,,149,5.478260869565218
1882711,5,B00009B8F5,It is a good series to use in teaching weather science on a middle school or high school level.  It reinforces the material in the texts and gets the students attention.,1354752000,,169,4.451612903225806
1882712,1,B00009B8F5,Not a great video about weather or anything else but a good source of reference on the narrator namely Donlad McIntyre.  You would be basically watching this chap's adventure exploring weather phenomena and the disasters it can cause. There are two discs on different weather patterns but I had enough of McIntyre at the end of the first one and do not feel like watching the second one.,1325289600,5,387,4.6911764705882355
1882713,5,B00009B8F5,"When I went to look for a copy of this movie, I didn't realize it was older.  The information is basic about the dangers of the weather.  It is very informative.",1280448000,,161,4.161290322580645
1882714,3,B00009B8F5,"Definitely had some good points; interesting information and footage.  However, it contains a lot about the history of weather, what different cultures thought about weather, myths, legends, and the gods.  If that's what you're looking for, you've found it.  I was looking for something that explained weather from a scientific aspect, which this movie does, at times.",1279929600,20,368,5.421052631578948
1882715,4,B00009B8F5,I loved this movie too. Showed it to my science class.  This was NOT made in 1975!  It is very recent.,1270684800,2,102,3.8095238095238093
1882716,5,B00009B8F5,Excellent video for reference in high school science when studying uneven heating of planet and related weather.,1265500800,,112,5.647058823529412
1882717,5,B00009B8F5,first time I learned how ice is formed on cars windshield and how tornado is formed. Still you would have made it more educational by adding more information on weather.,1213920000,2,169,4.666666666666667
1882718,4,B00009B8F5,"This is well made, and holds your interest, as the host explores all kinds of extreme weather conditions. You can learn a lot. It's not teaching you about normal weather patterns, though.",1212537600,3,187,4.875
1882719,5,B00009B8F5,I've used this series in 5th and 6th grade science classes for a couple years now.  The kids love it and I'm not sick of watching it either.  Donal puts himself in the craziest weather situations.  The kids love when he puts himself in harms way to show what weather extremes can do to the human body.,1210204800,3,301,4.245614035087719
1882720,5,B00009B8F5,"As a teacher, we are always looking for a great video that shows actual footage and great explainations. This videos does both. We LOVE to show this video. The kids are amazed and don't say a word until the video is over--they don't want to miss a minute.",1205884800,2,255,4.333333333333333
1882721,5,B00009B8F5,This video is great for middle school and high school earth science teachers.  I have used it in the classroom with very positive results.,1122940800,26,138,4.75
1882722,5,B00009B8F5,"Donal MacIntyre is at his best as host of The Weather . This is one of the best DVDs I own. If you like  National Geographic's ""Nature Fury"" you will like this one. It has good graphic's and is very fun to watch. I learned a lot about the weather from it. A great family video to watch with your older children.",1118448000,6,311,4.016129032258065

7990529,3,B00009B8F5,Movie is old and dated.,1475107200,,23,3.8
7990530,4,B00009B8F5,"I bought this to use in my middle school science classroom.  The videos are great and I made some worksheets to help students ""catch on"" to some of the more important topics covered.  However, I was very disappointed with the ""butt shot"" in the ""Cold"" chapter.  Unfortunately, the narrator found the need to be naked in the arctic and film his butt.  This is why we always preview before showing in class but this nonsense made this section unusable in my class.",1463702400,9,462,4.597560975609756
7990531,5,B00009B8F5,This is a fantastic DVDs. Must buy,1460160000,,34,4.0
7990532,5,B00009B8F5,"I use this in my classroom and they are entertaining as well as informational. Just be aware that the ""Cold"" video has a mostly naked man in it, no problem for at home, but in a middle school classroom, not the best choice. It is easy to skip that part.",1453852800,6,253,4.08
7990533,5,B00009B8F5,"Enjoyable, informative.",1447632000,,23,11.0
7990534,5,B00009B8F5,"Though it is now a bit dated, this is still a great intro to the factors that influence weather.  The host's adventure seeking style helps keep things interesting and fun.",1446595200,,171,4.7
