To say it stinks is not justified because the words to describe this movie would never be allowed in a civilized country, free speech notwithstanding. We should shoot the movie out into space and hope that aliens would pick it up, view it and wretch at the thought of coming to the place from whence it evolved. In order to watch this thing, I suggest you inget a fifth of Old Crow and smoke a few joints so that your mind would not have to absorb its full, horrible impact. In Spanish we would say ""horibilante"" (horrifying in the most wretched way). Need I say more? You can take it or leave it. I dumped it in the garbage after one showing. Now my garbage can stinks. 'nuff said.(By the way, I really enjoy Patrick Wayne as an actor and as a person, but why he did this one, I'll never know.)",1254787200,,894,4.203488372093023
