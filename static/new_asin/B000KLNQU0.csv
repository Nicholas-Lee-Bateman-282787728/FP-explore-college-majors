8158032,5,B000KLNQU0,"As a fan of George Best, I love this DVD.  It contains amazing footage of some of his most incredible goals including from his very early career with Manchester United.  In addition, it includes up close and personal interviews with Best himself, his father, his second wife Alex and some of his fellow players and long-time friends.  The extras include Best's ""50 best goals,"" more interview with Alex Best and George's opinion of the current Manchester United team (as of the time this DVD was made).  My husband (who is from Belfast and grew up watching George Best play) and I have watched it several times and we still really enjoy it.",1195084800,15,640,4.6875
