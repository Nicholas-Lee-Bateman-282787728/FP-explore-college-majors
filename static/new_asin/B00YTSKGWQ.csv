8719178,5,B00YTSKGWQ,I highly recommend this movie for  the family or friends to watch and help you understand what transgender means. I watched with my transgender daughter and I'm much more educated .,1486339200,2,181,4.838709677419355
8719179,4,B00YTSKGWQ,"Profiles a group of young individuals who feel they are in the wrong body and their parents. Some are shown in before and after. They explain from very early on they did not feel they were alright. Some parents are supportive while others are not so sure.  Talk of hormones to assist their situations.

Concludes with one person who went through the process who wonders if they may have possibly made a mistake. Insightful and at times emotional.",1466294400,4,446,4.705128205128205
8719180,4,B00YTSKGWQ,"This is a powerful intersectional work.  The beginning premise is that Trans adults have made progress and destroyed barriers, but what about trans youth?  This work then focuses on trans youth and their parents.  Further, they speak of trans youth beginning to have medical treatments to delay or change features.  This is the unexplored terrain for which even well-meaning experts have no definitive answers.
The children and their parents are very articulate here.  Like cisgendered youth, the trans youth here are incredibly tech-savvy and new technologies are giving them allies and information that trans individuals in the past would not have had.  I do have a concern, however.  I think the articulate voices here are due to all the interviewees being middle- or upper-class.  The work never mentions who would pay for these drug treatments and operations.  I am not convinced that conservative US medical regulators see these options as necessities.  Where were the trans kids who say, Like, you know! or speak Izzle?  Additionally, if I understand correctly, most trans ppl are MTFs, but this work focuses on FTMs.  The few MTFs here looked stereotypically feminine.  Where were the trans girls who don't pass well, who have huge Adams apples, who have tall bodies and broad shoulders?  It would seem to me that those who can be easily read are the ones who struggle the most.
The work spoke about puberty blockers that will help trans youth not gain secondary sex traits during puberty.  Still, I get the sense that these drugs can stop menstruation and breasts.  I didn't get the sense that it would stop lowering voices or gaining signs for those born male.  Again, this work focuses on FTMs.  I got the sense that these blockers help them, not their opposite-sex counterparts.  At one point, a cisgendered girl says, I didn't know my friend was born male until I saw her in the girls locker room.  I am glad schools are being more supportive of trans youth, but I get the sense that some local parents would have a fit if any human with a boyslab gets to use the girls locker room.  In the 1990s, the French made a powerful film about a femme-y boy named Ma Vie en Rose.  That film spoke local pressure against the boy outside of his parents control.  I don't know why this Frontline installment didn't speak about local parents who would attack supportive teachers and principals of these trans youth.
I loved the racial diversity of the trans youth here.  One person had white and Indian parents.  Another had Black and Latina parents.  A third had white and Latina parents.  Interracial marriages increase in number each year, but still, most married couples are INTRAracial ones.  I really wish the work would have asked if these parents, who may face prejudices against their marriages, might have more empathy for children who are also outside of the norm or status quo.  As a Black male progressive, I was saddened to see that the least supportive parent was a Black dad.  The sad thing is that its implied that he might leave his wife and child if the childs transition progresses.  I have heard anecdotally that parents with a disabled child divorce more often than those with able-bodied kids.  The time, cost, and strain of raising a disabled child somehow can put stress on a marriage.  One concrete example of that is brought up in the autobiography of Ted Haggerts wife.  In no way am I saying trans individuals are necessarily a part of the disabled community.  But I do see a possible connection when it comes to family dynamics here.
This work does make some brief comments about children who do not conform to gender standards but do not feel that they are in the wrong body.  Two trans males said, Many ask why cant I just be a tomboy?  A trans girl said, At least I know where I want to go.  Those who do not gender-conform who do not want surgery face alienation in this murky, gray area.  I believe this issue was interrogated in the academic text Female Masculinities.
Despite my concerns, this was a well-done, needed, and revolutionary work.  I salute the Frontline makers loudly for this.",1439683200,10,4128,4.767277856135402
