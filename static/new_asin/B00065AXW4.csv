2168654,4,B00065AXW4,"An assassin fails to kill Reverend Rhee (Master Bong Soo Han; THE TRIAL OF BILLY JACK - 1974), the leader of The World Wide Church, a Jim Jones-like religious cult, when the Reverend's head goon, Carl (Bob Schott), catches him before he can pull the trigger, forcing the Reverend to torture the assassin with acupuncture needles until he gives up his employer. After finding out that the employer is William Stark (Michael Prince), an old nemesis of the Reverend who lost the use of both of his legs the last time they met, the Reverend apparently lets the assassin go free, only to be killed by something that roams the underground corridors of the Reverend's cavernous mansion cellar. Stark hires black belt Jim Martin (Joe Lewis; JAGUAR LIVES - 1979) to put together a team of specialists to enter the Reverend's Palace of Celestial Tranquility (basically a secret place where the Reverend brainwashes his members) and rescue Cindy Lester (Amanda Wyss), the daughter of a rich businessman who has fallen for the Reverend's religious mumbo-jumbo. Jim picks five people he has worked with in the past to make up his team and we are introduced to them in a series of brief vignettes to show us their fighting skills: Billy (Benny Urquidez), Lockjaw (Sonny Barnes), Ezekial (Richard Norton; RAIDERS OF THE SUN - 1991), Laurie (Pam Huntington) and Willard (Ron Hayden), whom the rest break-out of an Ecuadorian prison. Carl kills Stark by attaching his useless legs to cables connected to cars going in the opposite direction (drawn and half-quartered, if you will), but the Force: Five team (shouldn't they be called Force: Six?) continue with their mission to rescue Cindy. The team goes undercover as the aides to Senator Forrester (Peter MacLean), who has come to the Reverend's fortress on a goodwill tour, mainly to make sure that there are no people there being kept against their will. The detection of an undercover newspaper reporter who has infiltrated the Church nearly blows the team's identity, but the Reverend deals him with in the same manner as the assassin earlier in the film. It all comes to a boil when the Reverend plans to kill the Senator and all the other interlopers in a helicopter crash. Expect a lot of flying feet and fists before this film wraps up.  This martial arts actioner, directed and written by Robert Clouse, who gave us such 70's & 80's drive-in classics like ENTER THE DRAGON (1973), BLACK BELT JONES (1974), GOLDEN NEEDLES (1974), THE ULTIMATE WARRIOR (1975), THE PACK (1977), GAME OF DEATH (1979), DEADLY EYES (1982) and the unforgettable GYMKATA (1985), may not represent Clouse at his prime, but there are glimpses of brilliance here. Particularly interesting are when Jim and his team break Willard out of prison, causing death and destruction, only to discover that Willard is living the high life behind bars (his cell is enormous and contains a huge projection TV, a sectional sofa and a separate bedroom!) and is bedding the warden's beautiful daughter. The only reason Willard agrees to go with them is because they ruined the good thing he had going there (especially when the warden finds out about his daughter!). There's also the mystery as to what roams the basement corridors of the Reverend's Palace of Celestial Tranquility (which is given away if you look at the patch worn by the Reverend's followers); the Reverend's punishment of a quartet of his men who fail to properly guard the huge stash of drugs and guns he has in his warehouse (think very sharp spurs and exposed necks); and lots of martial arts fights with plenty of over-amped sound effects. It's apparent that Clouse based his screenplay on the Jim Jones tragedy in Guyana (this is also an unofficial remake of director Oscar Williams' HOT POTATO [1976], minus most of the humor), but Jim's team makes sure that the outcome is not the same (no mass suicide here), just lots of fights, a smidgen of gore (when Richard Norton kills a man by tossing a rotary saw blade into his stomach, he says, ""Thank God for Black and Decker!"") and the Reverend's ability to turn himself invisible (a talent I don't believe Jim Jones had). FORCE: FIVE is entertaining in a mindless sort of way and head-and-shoulders above Clouse's (who died in 1997) later films, including CHINA O'BRIEN (1990), CHINA O'BRIEN 2 (1991) and IRONHEART (1992; his last film). Not to be confused with the 1975 TV movie FORCE FIVE, which has an eerily similar plot. Hmmmm... Also starring Tom Villard (POPCORN - 1991) as a fervent Church disciple, Dennis Mancini as the unfortunate reporter and Mel Novak (SWORD OF HEAVEN - 1984) as the assassin. Available on a beautiful anamorphic widescreen DVD from Scorpion Releasing. Rated R.",1400371200,5,4716,4.887640449438202
2168655,4,B00065AXW4,This is the best version of this movie I have seen. If you like Force: Five you definitely need to make this addition to your collection.,1393027200,6,137,4.3076923076923075
2168656,2,B00065AXW4,"Released in 1981, Force: Five tells the touching true (or not) story of a top-secret mission to rescue a Senator's daughter from the clutches of a megalomaniacal cult leader. Tasked to infiltrate the compound is lantern-jawed Jim Morton (Joe Lewis), a crackerjack agent with a talent for hand-to-hand combat and an unwavering desire to serve both his country and the political hacks that occupy it's highest chambers.

His crew includes the big and tough Lockjaw, a small, dangerous man named Billy Ortega, the lethal enchantress Cindy, and Ezekiel (Richard Norton), the Australian hot-head. This deeply impressive combat unit is inserted undercover into the cult, and work to track down and evac the daughter before something really terrible happens.

Director Robert Clouse test-drives his mojo on this martial arts extravaganza before ascending to the pinnacle of the craft with his masterwork, Gymkata. The result is, unfortunately, middling. The potential was there for a memorable B-movie gem, but a lackadaisical pace and not enough dated lunacy holds it back.

Still, there is some fun to be hadand that fun lies almost exclusively in the composition of the team itself. Let's take a deeper dive:

Jim Morton
He's the leader and he doesn't take crap from anyone. The first man the government goes to when something dirty needs doing (even through it appears he can't elevate his leg over his shoulder during kicks), Morton is the one man the rest of the team listens to. His hair is fantastic.
Personal Highlight: What's the best way to recruit a woman who lives by herself? Sneak into her house and pretend you're a rapist! Chicks dig that approach.

Ezekiel
The lithe Richard Norton infuses this stud-of-the-group with the kind of garbled with that one would associate with a kung-fu surfer or, perhaps, a drunk. But when the chips are down, you want Ezekiel by your side because, frankly, he appears to be the only member of the team that can perform a martial arts move without tearing his labrum.
Personal Highlight: The guy flips out in a pool hall and you know what that means: gratuitous shots of cues being broken over the backs of stunt men.

Cindy
Smart, beautiful and prone to fighting in her nightgown, Cindy offers the requisite sexual tension for Jim, while also filling the important role of breaking up the wiener-fest. During the mission she plays a key role in securing the Senator's daughter, but doesn't fight nearly enough to be a true femme fatale.
Personal Highlight: has to be her forgiving nature. One minute she's in the battle for her life against what she thinks is a would-be sexual predator; the next, she's making out with him.

Lockjaw
He's a huge, mean black dude with a GI Joe name.
Personal Highlight: He kills the guy who played Thorg in Gymkata.

Billy Ortega
Built like a fire hydrant and sporting the personality of a Cheezit, Billy may rival Ezekial in his martial artistry. What sets him apart is the fact he kind of looks like a porcelain doll with a bowl cut.
Personal Highlight: None.

Scorpion's DVD is simple: an okay-looking 1.78:1 anamorphic widescreen transfer, 2.0 stereo and no extras.

8038784,2,B00065AXW4,"With the talent on offer here, I expected much more from the fight scenes. HKC this isn't. After enjoying the hell out of the scarce ""jaguar lives"" I expected this to certainly surpass it in the fight scenes, but found that the talents of the cast weren't on display as expected. Perhaps it's just poor choreography, but The Jet and Richard Norton are nowhere near as impressive as in their Jackie Chan outings. Here they look slow and not particularly well coordinated by comparison. It was mildly entertaining, but there's nothing worth a repeat, so I won't watch it again",1424563200,3,574,4.75
