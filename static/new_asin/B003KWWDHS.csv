8399105,1,B003KWWDHS,"this was an play with no real charactors. I would read the papers and watch the news to see what happen on that sad day. Somebody just wanted to make a dollar off Marvins death. i already had a large collection on Marvin Gaye, but this play was a joke to classic Motown Artist. Don't waste your money. Save it and go see Frankie Beverly & Maze.",1402358400,,344,4.149253731343284
8399106,5,B003KWWDHS,"I had seen a clip of Marvin Gaye on youtube but it was too short and  it didn't give much information about his background.  I searched Amazon and saw Final 24: His Final Hours and thought this would be interesting so, I purchased it.",1324339200,,234,4.295454545454546
8399107,1,B003KWWDHS,"This is not a cheap representation of Marvin's life by very poor actors with a very poor script, horrible sets, and horrible photograpy. Very disappointing and a complete waste of money, don't waste your time with this.",1303171200,,219,4.945945945945946
8399108,5,B003KWWDHS,This really goes into deep details of how Marvin lived and died. No need to buy the other dvd'S on his life because I purchased some of the others and none are more detailed then this one.,1289865600,6,188,4.108108108108108
8399109,5,B003KWWDHS,"Marvin Gaye's murder must have influenced the filicidal scene in Spike Lee's ""Jungle Fever.""  In film and reality, an elderly father shoots and kills his drug-addicted son in front of the son's mother.

I love James Cameron's ""Titanic"" because it allowed me to see what happened on that tragic ship ride without my having to be there (not that I could have been there when my grandfather wasn't even born yet).  The ""Final 24"" series allows the same experience.  I would say that Gaye's rise and fame were ""before my time.""  However, when I think about how his music resonated with my parents and other African Americans of their age bracket, I realize what a tragedy his murder was to Black musical culture.

In every ""Final 24"" installment, I learn something about the subject that has nothing to do with their death.  Here I learned that most of Gaye's greatest hits were predicted to be flops by Berry Gordy and others.  To this day, or maybe even more so, the music industry, and its fans, is fickle.  I salute Gaye for taking risks when he could have played it safe artistically.

This work said Gaye was once married to a woman at least a decade older than him and then he later married a 16 year-old.  (Why he wasn't charged with statutory you-know-what I don't know.)  Off the top of my head, this is the first time I've heard of a famous man who had May-December marriages in both directions.  The work said ""What's Going On?"" was dedicated to or about Gaye's brother.  Given the extreme family dysfunction in his life, I didn't know Gaye was close to his sibling.

The work interviews men and women, whites and Blacks.  His sister and sister-in-law are interviewed, thus I imagine the family gave its permission for the documentary.  When I read ""The Autobiography of Malcolm X,"" it stood out to me that Malcolm predicted that he would be assassinated.  Here, Gaye predicted his death, but he bought the gun and gave it to the man who would eventually kill him.  (There's an anti-gun message in this tragedy if you think about it.)  I've heard of the term ""suicide by proxy,"" but this real-life incident reveals to me how jaw-dropping that concept can be.

The very first statement that the (British) narrator makes is that Gaye's father was a crossdresser.  Granted the father was a shameful man, but I felt that having that fact revealed first may have been transphobic.  Even for people not fans of soul music, this work may be attractive to viewers from dysfunctional families or adult sons who don't get along with their domineering fathers.",1284768000,5,2557,4.683856502242152
