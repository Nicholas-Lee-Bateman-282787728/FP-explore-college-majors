I couldn't watch it enough..When i found it in a store i knew i had to buy it..even tho it is a grade b movie, it brought back alot of great memories from my childhood... The actors weren't great, the monsters were kinda funny..today, whenever we see fog we joke about the slime people being out there somewhere...",987292800,2,446,4.137931034482759
747057,3,630398536X,"Most of the elements of a really good (or bad, depending on how you look  at it) B-movie are in place here.  The acting is bad, but in a funny, campy  sort of way.  The monsters look kind of cool yet, at the same time,  hilarious.  The irrational actions of both humans and monsters are also a  great source of amusement in this film.  The movie begins right in the  middle of the crisis, wherein the slime monsters have invaded L.A. and  built a wall around the city, but as the scientist and his two daughters  are explaining this horrible apocalyptic situation, they are acting as  though they are going to a tea party.  An episode of hysteria breaks out at  one point as a man the group hardly knows is killed by a monster, yet when  the scientist's daughter is dragged away by the monsters, no one shows any  emotion at all.  Her boyfriend, who is at fault for the occurence, acts  about as upset as if he had just spilled a glass of water.  Maybe not even  that upset.  Some of the monster death scenes are so silly that I had to  rewind the tape several times to watch them over and over again.  These are  just a few of the things I found funny about this movie.  Cheesy B-movie  fans really need to see this one.  It's a very good bad movie!",968198400,,1250,4.208510638297873
747058,1,630398536X,"This movie is a real bad one. The story is not bad, but the actors are soooo terrible. The dialogues are cheasy...What else is there to say ? Well, some slimy monsters try to conquer earth and killing everone who is  in sight and a group of people trying to defense our world. If you want to  see a comedy, I think ""The slime people"" will certainly make you  laugh !",954633600,,366,4.126760563380282

747160,3,630398536X,"OK, if you're reading this you know you'd probably enjoy this movie regardless of the reviews.  (I really hate when non genre fans give this type of movie negative reviews, you either ""get it"" or you don't).  As I began watching this I thought to myself that perhaps ""The Mist"" took some inspiration from this film, in both films a fog (or mist) envelopes a city and a small group of people must fight to survive.  That's where the parallels stop.  The Mist was a great movie and The Slime People is more of the so bad its good type of ""B"" movie.  Its probably on par with the better known Hideous Sun Demon and Giant Gila Monster.  I must admit the creature outfits aren't too shabby either; so grab some popcorn and enjoy!",1208131200,,724,4.365671641791045
747161,3,630398536X,"First off, I would like to say I had not seen this film in years before buying this DVD version. My copy had no audio or video problems like some have stated in their reviews. In fact, the print looks very good.

I know this is not considered a very good movie, but for some reason, I like it! It is silly and the actor's playing the  Slime People choking at the end are hysterical. When they were falling to their death on the ground, I expected the poor creatures to kick their legs in the air! LOL! Some nights, I'm up late and this goofy old horror stuff is just what the doctor orderd! If you're a fan of 50's sci-fi and other cheaply made horror films, this is one film, you might want to take a look at.",1173225600,2,710,4.064285714285714
747162,2,630398536X,"I've read a number of comments on here for The Slime People (1963), specifically in relation to the dialog track being missing from the Rhino DVD release...I can understand the frustration in not getting what one pays for, but those who did receive versions without this element might consider themselves lucky, as I watched the movie last night, and the dialog didn't help the film any...the film was directed by Robert Hutton who, incidentally, also stars...I can't help wonder if he got the directing gig and then cast himself in the lead role afterwards.  If I come off as sounding biased against Mr. Hutton it's only because this is the 2nd feature I've seen this week starring this individual, the other being the tepid sci-fi feature They Came From Beyond Space (1967), and after that, I wasn't too keen on spending more time with him anytime soon...also appearing with Hutton is Robert Burton (I Was a Teenage Frankenstein), Susan Hart (The Ghost in the Invisible Bikini), who, by the way, was married to James H. Nicholson, co-founder of AIP (American International Pictures), William Boyce, Judee Morton (The Explosive Generation), and Les Tremayne (The War of the Worlds, The Monolith Monsters, The Angry Red Planet).

The film starts with a strange creature, armed with a spear, rising from the sewer (actually it uses one of those underground elevators to rise to street level, but whatever).  Soon afterwards a man is found dead on the beach due to severe case of lead poisoning (he had a spear protruding from his back), which leads into the opening credits, followed by scenes involving a small aircraft, piloted by television personality Tom Gregory (Hutton), struggling through some inclement weather.  He manages to land the plane, but discovers the airport is deserted, that is until a station wagon arrives containing Professor Galbraith (Burton) and his two daughters Lisa (Hart), and Bonnie (Morton)...where the hell did they come from(turns out they were away in the mountains while nearly everyone else evacuated)?  Anyway, they relate a fantastic story to Tom about scaly, slime covered, prehistoric, man-like creatures taking over L.A. by using a fog machine to encase the city in an impenetrable dome made of hardened slime (turns out the monsters were disturbed by our deep drilling and underground nuclear testing, and have now decided to take over the surface world)...to which Tom thinks they're a bunch of real jokers but learns otherwise after viewing some news footage back at the television station where he works.  This is also where they hook up with Calvin `Cal' Johnson, a marine (okay, since when is `The Ducktail' an approved hairstyle for the marines?) who got separated from his unit and sought refuge at the station.  The group formulates a plan (well, the professor does, and the rest go along with him) to break through the wall by trying all kinds of different chemicals...after this some stuff happens (most of it pretty boring), the group ends up in a butcher shop (hey, turkey legs are 35 cents a pound), some more stuff happens, Bonnie gets kidnapped, blah, blah, blah...oh yeah, there's a whole lot of fog which tends to obfuscate matters, but this wasn't necessarily a bad thing...

I said this for the film They Came From Beyond Space and I'm saying it again for this one, Robert Hutton just doesn't seem like leading man material to me...in supporting roles he'd be fine, but I have yet to see him carry an entire film.  Actually, he seems to be more of the villain type as he has sinister features (like that pencil line mustache)...but compared to the others in this film, Hutton comes off like a master thespian.  I don't want to pick on William Boyce too much as this was his first (and only) role, but he was truly terrible and his character came off as an idiot (so do the rest, but his doubly so due to his own incompetence)...watch for the scene in which he, during a moment of frustration, smacks his fist in his hand ala Burt Ward (as the Robin character) in the mid 1960's Batman television show.  The women acted pretty in pretty much standard fashion for a film like this, often screaming in phony terror, getting all overly dramatic, and, in general, presenting themselves as liabilities.  The only halfway interesting character is that played by Les Tremayne (he played a kooky writer the group picks up about mid picture), but he's written as such an antagonizing jerk you just know he's not going to make it until the end.  Of course, no one is aided by the terrible script and directionally challenged and tedious plot, perfectly illustrated in the method used to fill the audience in on a good number of the details by making us watch the characters watch newsreel footage, much of which talked about battles between the army and hordes of slime men, but never actually showed any fighting.  Especially sickening is the love angles that develop between Professor Galbraith's daughters and the two men, who are about as charming as dead wood.  For a film that's only about an hour and fifteen minutes long, it sure knew how to drag things out...the monsters (by the way, three creatures, which is the most seen on the screen at anyone time, hardly makes an invasion) looked pretty decent, but were hardly slimy, as indicated by the title.  While they looked reasonably decent, they did move around like guys in elaborate rubber suits unsure of their footing (slow and awkward), were hardly menacing, and made really funny noises akin to someone unclogging a drain...gurgle gurgle...blort...gurgle...at least the filmmakers didn't shy away from showing them as they're the first thing we see as the story opens.  And one more thing with regards to the group retreating to the butcher store...I was half hoping they'd take up arms (cleavers, boning knifes, etc.) and fight the creatures, but no such luck...

The picture one this Rhino DVD release looks pretty good, but does show some signs of wear.  The audio is a different story...some have commented on here that the dialog track is missing from their DVD...I had no such problem with mine, as the audio came through pretty well until about halfway through as some audio fuzz made the dialog difficult to hear.  This cleared up, but then came back again near the end.  There are no special features on this DVD, but there are chapter stops, for what its worth.

By the way, the tagline for this film 'Up from the bowels of the earth come...' is partially appropriate...this film came from the bowels of something...",1120003200,3,6556,4.870619946091645
747163,3,630398536X,"Here's my take on The Slime People.  There's a group of guys sitting around the studio trying to come up with a movie idea, one that won't be rejected like all of their previous submissions.  From out of nowhere, the fog machine goes haywire and won't shut off, and the studio has to send everyone home.  Before a tech can get there to fix the thing, though, these would-be filmmakers decide that this is the chance they've been dreaming of; they have to move quick, though, before someone fixes the machine.  They quickly decide to make a monster movie; naturally, since this is the early 1960s, atomic testing will be used to explain how the whole mess is really our own fault and not the monsters'.  But what kind of monster should it be?  Someone yells out - ""I know, let's make it slime people.""  Since the repairman is on his way and no one has a better idea, they go for it.  This is what they came up with: these slime people have been living underground and in our sewers for a very long time; nuclear testing has put a burr in their collective saddle so they have come up top to take over our world - well, Los Angeles, anyway.  They've got this machine that makes fog, and this fog lowers the temperature enough so that they can survive above ground; then there's a wall, a wall somehow made out of the fog, which seals the whole city within an impenetrable barrier.  Brilliant, they all say - all but one - and get right to work.  Mr. ""Rain On Our Parade"" keeps asking questions: What are we going to use to make the wall?  Why do these Slime People all look strangely like Bigfoot?  Why is there no slime actually involved here?  You know the type. Look, they explain, it doesn't matter how dumb the monsters look, and we don't even have to build a fake wall at all - there's fog all over the place.  People won't even be able to see the heroes half the time, much less the crummy sets and ridiculous monster outfits.  Mr. Pessimist nods and then asks how apparently reptilian creatures, being cold-blooded, could survive beneath the earth and why, if they came aboveground, they would want to lower the temperature rather than raise it for their own comfort and survival.  Don't worry about it, kid, they say; one of our characters is going to be a professor; when you have a professor in your film, you can say and do whatever you want.  If the professor says it's so, the audience will believe it.  The rest, as they say, is bad movie history.
Maybe this isn't exactly how The Slime People came about, but it might as well have been.  In many respects, it's your typical old monster-type movie, only this one has extra helpings of fog hiding a lot of what is supposedly happening.  The whole thing is rather silly, really, yet The Slime People proves somewhat entertaining in spite of itself in a B horror movie sort of way.",1073520000,11,2840,4.423076923076923
747164,1,630398536X,"Beware! The Rhino DVD does not include the soundtrack. Let me qualify that statement;  it has an incidental sound effects track, but not the dialogue track.
I sent it back to Rhino, but they only sent along another silent copy. I asked them to check it out before they replaced it, but ...... I'm not going to ship back to Rhino; I already spent more than this turkey is worth and am not going to pay the shipping charges again.
It's a shame as someone had done a great job on cleaning up the video-excellent clear and crisp visuals. A lot of effort for nought....a movie that appeals only to the lovers of bad films and rubber-suited monsters (you know who you are).
If Rhino ever fixes their mistake, will someone please let me know?",1070668800,4,735,4.444444444444445

747166,4,630398536X,"I enjoyed this movie, taking place in a real foggy dew pointed
los angeles. The story is humans have been [messing] around again with radiation h-bomb tests etc kinda making it hard for the slime people to live underground.
anyway the slime people emerge up from underground and make the atmosphere to their liking raising the temp dew point etc.
the last few survivors battle the creatures.(now here's the fun
part) they make sounds like farting and burping at the same time
while they fight the humans hand to hand
all in all an enjoyable flick
the makers could have gone further with the plot though",1021939200,,602,4.688679245283019
747167,1,630398536X,"I was sooooo excited to see that Rhino Video was finally releasing this schlock 1962 B&W C-grade Sci-Fi/Horror gem, having worn out 2 VHS video copies of it. I grew up with this title, and it's still FABULOUS-as bottom-shelf as it gets. However, when I received my copy, it had no audible dialog track for the actors! I contacted Rhino for a replacement, having told them about the problem. After sending back the original copy at my own expense, I received a replacement approx. 1 mo. later. It too contained no dialog track. The sound track for the ambient sound (background/sound effects/musical score) is there, and the picture/transfer print is nice, but without dialog, it is thoroughly unwatchable. All in all, the most unsatisfying experience I have had with ANY DVD product ever. I don't know if I just happened to score the ""mother lode"" with 2 defective copies out of thousands, or what. I do know that I tried all available audio setting combinations available on my DVD player, and none would make the dialog track audible. I compared other DVD's to it on every setting imaginable, and they all worked flawlessly. I would say that the quality control of Rhino products is deplorable, and that their customer service dept's. cheif aim is to get you off of their backs. I give up. I'll get another VHS copy.

747168,3,630398536X,"This is another of those sentimental favorite Saturday-afternoon cheesy monster flicks, though I have to admit it's probably rough sledding for the mainstream movie crowd. While not the monumental mess that bad film junkies hope for, there's still plenty of horrible acting and bizarre dialogue and plotting, and the Slime People themselves are pretty cool looking (even if you can see their pants underneath the suits). Fans of Zappa-style ""cheepnis"" won't be disappointed. On the downside, it's a bit talky at times, and the younger crowd raised on Bottin and Baker and CGI may find it boring.
Rhino's DVD is plenty sharp and the source print is very clean with only some very light, sporadic speckling visible. The beginning and end of the movie exhibit very-good-to-excellent tonal values and detail, although the middle third or so looks quite dark. It appears that it was filmed this way (there's lots of fog everywhere and apparently these scenes were shot day-for-night, if badly). Other scenes interspersed with the dark sections look just fine. My Video Gems VHS pre-record appears quite a bit brighter, though it's also too contrasty, very soft, and lacking in detail; generally far inferior except for the brightness issue. Rhino's transfer appears to more accurately capture the values of the source material, though this leaves some scenes almost unwatchably dark. Fans of this movie will probably bear with it, others may find it rough going. No trailer, just chapter stops like other Rhino/Acme releases. All in all not bad for the money, but not spectacular either.",1000771200,2,1582,5.159533073929961
7857687,5,630398536X,Some of the old monster films are even worse (better) than one may remember. This one is a corny classic that I love to watch. It has no logic or reason and it is fun.

For this is indeed a turkey of memorable proportions.  A preposterous story is coupled with sloppy continuity, seasoned with campy acting and ridiculously low budget special effects.  The result is a real hoot.  There are not many slime people in this production, because they only had one complete slime person suit....and it has a really big zipper that shows up during the fight scenes.  And the people that populate this film, including the brilliant if somewhat slightly besotted 'professor' and his randy daughters, are all about as clever as the movie's director....i.e. dumb as a bag of hammers.  How else could three slime people with only two spears vanquish the US Army and take over Los Angeles using an impenetrable ""fog wall"" ?  The last twenty minutes of the film are lost in a soft focus of fog, where all you are left with are the disembodied voices of the actors vainly describing their last ditch struggle to save LA from the Slime People.

7857696,3,630398536X,"This flick is as flapdoodley funny as any unconscious farce ever conceived!  The script is so sappy that its utter existence strains credulity, and the direction of Robert Hutton (who also starred) is so overwrought and sporadically paced that viewers would more likely flinch and scream (with laughter) over one of the several abrupt fits of female hysteria than at the sight of one of the grotesquely froggy, gurgly monsters.  And there's hysterics aplenty, what with the two whiney, weepy, squealing, and screeching sister characters who cling to the male romantic interests--and melt at the first words of woo pitched in the precious moments between slimer stalkings.  The older sib, a prim thirty-something, loses neither high heel, draped sweater, prodigious pocketbook, or even a tress from her French twist as she clomps through dark buildings and foggy woods.  The younger, pony-tailed sis, pursued not only by the sleestaky creatures but by a melodramatic, gee-whizzing Marine, acts and looks about twelve years old.
