4176509,5,B003R4ZMSQ,"As you can tell from my title, I am a HUGE Melissa Joan Hart fan. I first watched her on Nickelodeon's ""Clarissa Explains It All"" and have since followed her career. (""Sabrina, the Teenage Witch"" still remains my favorite show to this day.) ""Melissa & Joey"", regardless of my admiration for Ms. Hart, is a smart, fresh, and modern comedy. Too many have commented that this series is a ""Who's the Boss?"" knock-off, but I disagree. While sharing a similar premise, this show is definitely one of a kind and has its own identity, as the characters are well-developed and are brought to life from such a wonderful cast. I have been hooked on ""Melissa & Joey"" since day one. While some may remember Hart and Lawrence from their childhood, this show is for a more mature audience than their previous series. For me, ""Melissa & Joey"" is just as good as my other favorites: ""Modern Family,"" ""The Big Bang Theory,"" ""The Middle"" & ""Rules of Engagement."" If you are a fan of any of these series, you will love ABC Family's hit comedy. Make sure to check out ""Season One, Part Two,"" which features the remaining eighteen episodes of the first season. Trust me; you won't be disappointed.",1315440000,3,1175,4.626794258373206
4176510,5,B003R4ZMSQ,I absolutely am addicted to this show and am so relieved to see it picked up for another season!  It is a great show for the whole family.  And I absolutely love their chemistry... as an adult I still tune with the hopes that they will become a couple...,1314921600,2,254,4.163265306122449

4176512,4,B003R4ZMSQ,"Some shows thrive not on the quality of their writing or production values, but on the strength of likable, dependable personalities in front of the camera.  Melissa & Joey is such a show.  Sure, WHO'S THE BOSS? already tackled the ""manny"" premise (although it was called ""housekeeper"" in the 80's), and mismatched couples have been the bread & butter of sitcoms since at least the 1960's.  But by casting two beloved t.v. stars (no coincidence, either, since Hart and Lawrence do double duty as executive producers), the show manages to rather easily hook viewers.

Truth be told, I found the first 3 or so episodes to be very average.  But things start to pick up as the chemistry builds between the leads, and the relatively small supporting cast starts to find their own voices.  Melissa Joan Hart has been a gifted comic actress since her pre-teen Nickelodeon years, and it's to her credit than the somewhat edgy Mel Burke remains a thoroughly likable character.  Joey Lawrence, himself a 30+ year t.v. veteran, is solid as well, with a slightly more believable character with which to work.

One word of caution: Don't be fooled by the ""ABC Family"" logo.  Melissa & Joey, while never really wallowing in gutter humor, can aim low with the best (or worst?) of them at times.  Still, for appropriate ages, it's as good as anything on network television at the moment.  Whether you consider that a compliment or not probably depends on how much t.v. you watch.  My wife and I watch quite a bit, and even though the show IS very familiar at times, it's still entertaining and fun to watch.  And really, does a sitcom need to do more than that?",1310342400,5,1645,4.689895470383275
4176513,5,B003R4ZMSQ,"I started watching this show because I grew up watching Sabrina the Teenage Witch and loved Melissa Joan Hart. This Show is smart, witty, and just plain funny the cast is great and so is the writing. The DVDs are fine and play very well. Bonus features include a Blooper Reel and a Sneak Peak at Upcoming Episodes. I am very pleased with the DVDs. The 2nd half of season 1 premieres June 29th 2011.

4176514,5,B003R4ZMSQ,"I love this series!
First off the lead stars are PERFECT together!
I already loved ""My Fake Fiance"" and thought Melissa Joan Hart
and Joey Lawrence had amazing chemistry together and they keep
it in tune for this series as well!
This is actually more ""adult"" than one may think!
Definately not just a kids show! Some of the jokes are
geared toward the older fans! It's as good as any prime-time
sitcom on the major networks, if not BETTER!
What is even more cool, is that it takes place in my town
of Toledo, Ohio...HOWEVER, I hope that in future episodes they
reference the town slightly more with actual Toledo facts!
Maybe mention the MUDHENS STADIUM or TOLEDO ART MUSEUM!
I did catch the MUDHENS items in the background during a scene
in one episode when Melissa and her friend were in a bar together!
Some of the pics they show of buildings, etc. do not look much like
Toledo tho! lol
Anyway...I hope this show continues for quite some time!
GREAT SHOW! GREAT CAST!
Can't wait for new episodes to start! :)",1309046400,10,1011,4.5
4176515,4,B003R4ZMSQ,"Appellate Judge Tom Becker, DVD Verdict -- ""Since it airs on ABC Family, I assumed Melissa & Joey would be a kid-centric sitcom along the lines of Full House or Boy Meets World. At the very least, since it seems a direct descendent (if not outright knock off) of Who's the Boss, I figured it would offer up a ""Will they or won't they?"" coupling along with sitcom-cute moppets and life-lesson moralizing at every turn. Imagine my surprise when Melissa & Joey instead turned out to be more interested in delivering laughs than homilies. Even though it features teenagers and a nontraditional family unit, this is not ""all ages"" television. Much of the humor skews adult and some jokes, while funny, are downright crude. It's not ""appointment TV"" (does that even exist anymore in the world of DVR?), but it's as good as, if not better than, many current network sitcoms, offering solid writing, some pretty funny jokes, and attractive and engaging leads. Shout! Factory has given us the first 12 episodes spread over two discs. Supplements include a blooper reel, ""featurettes"" that are actually family life-oriented questions posed to the stars, and a brief promo for the rest of the season.""",1303257600,19,1190,4.896039603960396

4176523,3,B003R4ZMSQ,"I've been a fan of Melissa Joan Hart since back in her Clarissa Explains It All days, so when I found out she was going to star in a new sitcom on ABC Family, I immediately made plans to watch it.  And I stuck with Melissa & Joey for its first half a season, although the results have not been quite as good as I'd hoped they would be.

Mel Burke (Melissa Joan Hart) is a local Politian in Toledo, Ohio.  Her life is turned upside down when her sister and brother-in-law are caught in a financial scandal.  Not only does she have to make sure her innocence is proclaim to voters, but she finds herself taking care of her teenage niece and nephew Lennox and Ryder (Taylor Spreitler and Nick Robinson).

Trying to balance all of this is overwhelming her until Joe Longo (Joseph Lawrence) walks into their lives.  Joe worked for Mel's brother-in-law and lost all his money to the man.  Desperate for a job, he agrees to stay on as the manny (male nanny).  Since neither of them have an experience raising kids, will they be able to get through this together?  And what of the sparks neither one wants to admit are there between them.

Okay, so the premise is a rip off of other sitcoms.  I'd never seen the older classics with similar set ups, so I was able to judge this one on its own merits.  Unfortunately, those merits are a mixed bag.

A few of the episodes are pretty funny.  I liked the Halloween themed episode, and there's a fun one where Mark Ballas from Dancing with the Stars shows up to teach Mel to dance.  (He was her partner when she was on the show.)  However, many of the episodes are fairly standard sitcom plots with the predictable jokes.  Heck, I wasn't surprised to learn that Joe is an excellent cook while Mel can't even make cold cereal correctly.

Meanwhile, we've got the case of the assistants.  For the first half of these episodes, Elizabeth Ho played Mel's assistant Rhonda.  She was funny and a great addition to the cast.  With no explanation, they replaced her with Lucy DeVito's Stephanie.  The problem is that Stephanie is an annoying character with hardly any personality.  I certainly don't blame Lucy who does her best with the flat ""Yes Man"" character she has.

The rest of the cast is quite good, and on the episodes where they are given some great material, they really knock it out of the park.  Melissa Joan Hart can be a bit over the top at times, but she has always had that tendency.  They've also go fun guest stars like Christopher Rich and Julia Duffy.

Finally, there's the sex.  I must admit I was shocked at just how much of the show is based on sexual humor and double meanings.  I guess I was expecting a little less of that since the show is on ABC Family.  This is definitely a more adult oriented show, but it is obviously aiming for a slightly younger market.  Even so, I usually find some decent laughs in every episode.

ABC Family aired twelve episodes in later summer and fall last year, and those are the ones that are collected in this two disc set.  Coincidentally, it's released just in time to remind us about the show before the second half of season one starts.  Extras include a gag reel and the cast talking about real life family dynamics and issues.

When the show comes back, I'll be tuning in because I get some laughs from it, but I doubt it will become a classic sitcom.  Melissa & Joey is fun, but it could be funnier.",1432166400,,3396,4.39486356340289

4176551,5,B003R4ZMSQ,"Starting off by saying I love Melissa Joan Hart. I grew up with Clarissa Explains it All and Sabrina the Teenage Witch and now in Melissa and Joey. It seems that in each main show she has starred in; the target audience is of that age that she is during the show. Clarissa kids to tweens, Sabrina tweens to teens and M&J, well i don't wanna say adult but the show does focus around her and Joey moreover the children. Yes many jokes are more risque than other family ABC shows but this show should not be considered an ""adult"" show. After just a few episodes you immediately start thinking of Who's The Boss, and that idea is cemented when Mona herself makes an appearance on the show. Hart and Lawrence are great sitcom actors and the chemistry is definitely there. My favorite moment of this season was the Halloween ep where Ryder suggests to her aunt Mel to be a teenage witch and Mel replies, been there done that. I love it hahahahaha, us 17 year olds can feel nostalgia too! In conclusion, i HIGHLY recommend this show to ANY age group and to the whole family.",1325462400,3,1067,4.393939393939394

If you like frequent profanity and extramarital sex treated as a joke with no consequences, then this show is for you.  It was not for me.  The Melissa character is shallow and unlikeable.  Why is this channel called ABC FAMILY?  This show is not for children or teenagers, and not for adults who value fidelity.",1317254400,7,448,4.525

8403184,5,B003R4ZMSQ,"I actually started watching this show on tv as reruns a few years after it was pulled. It is a funny and even-paced family drama about an aunt raising her niece and nephew after a financial scandal leaves her sister in jail and brother in law on the lamb. Said aunt hires one of the people affected by the scandal to be her live in nanny and he is very much the firm hand this mixed family needs but is very much in love with his boss, though he tries to hide it.

The only cons I have about the DVD are:
- order of the episodes on disc out of sync with original airtime order.
- season 1 is split into 2 parts
- seasons 2-4 have not been released on DVD yet despite the show concluding in late 2015.
