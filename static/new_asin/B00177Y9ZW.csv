3167948,2,B00177Y9ZW,"I do agree with a couple of the reviews but the thing that bugged me was the movie was very short, could have been a TV show. Actully a Mad TV alumni, Nicole Parker, steals the movie when she plays Britney Spears. It went by really fast and there is some parts of the film that makes me wonder why it wasn't rated R. Of course, all comedys and horror movies these days will get a unratred treatment upon there dvd release. Some funny parts but im getting sick of all these spoof movies. The trailer is probably the best thing to watch because it had all the good moments. First movie ive ever seen that the trailer is basically the whole movie. The ending was really, really, really stupid.  Not really worth paying money to see it but maybe to rent it for four bucks or less.",1201564800,5,776,4.243243243243243
3167949,4,B00177Y9ZW,"This is a hilarious spoof of ""300"". It is a great absolutely mindless movie you can get a real laugh from. It makes fun of everything and everyone! This movie is for sure not for everyone. I enjoyed it very much.",1201392000,9,212,4.195121951219512
3167950,4,B00177Y9ZW,"It now seems as if over the top parodies are increasing in popularity; the past two years alone has seen the release of ""Date Movie,"" ""Scary Movie 4,"" ""Epic Movie,"" and ""The Comebacks."" We now have ""Meet the Spartans,"" a vulgar, slapstick spoof that the characters openly admit is a cheap rip off of ""300."" It also takes grain pains to exploit reality TV, with ""American Idol,"" ""America's Next Top Model,"" and ""Deal or No Deal"" all being mocked at one point or another. Considering how disappointing ""Scary Movie 4"" and ""Epic Movie"" were, I was greatly surprised by how often I laughed during ""Meet the Spartans."" It might have something to do with ""300,"" a film I thought was brilliant; ""Meet the Spartans"" is not brilliant at all, but it definitely turns ""300"" into an entertaining farce through its physical humor, a few gross-out visuals, and more gay jokes than you'll probably ever hear in your life.

The plot is ... oh, that's right--movies like this don't have a plot. I can say that it follows many of the same ideas shown in ""300,"" which begins with an old man standing at the edge of a cliff with a baby in his arms. In Sparta, the sickly-looking babies are thrown over, left to die amongst a pile of skulls. The first baby the man holds--an infant Shrek that, of course, vomits all over the place--is the first to go. The second baby is Vietnamese, which is why ""Brangelina gets first choice,"" according to the narrator. The third baby is Leonidas, and we know this because he already has a full-grown beard. As a child, he's trained to become a warrior, and by ""training,"" I mean fistfight sessions with his grandmother; as a pimply teenager with braces, he's left alone in the snowy wilderness to fight a gigantic penguin that talks like a ghetto gangster (and yes, it has happy feet).

As an adult (Sean Maguire), Leonidas is King and the greatest warrior Sparta has ever known. He's also a ""war-mongering, latent homosexual,"" as sung during an on-the-spot beer commercial. He greets his wife (Carmen Electra) with a high-five while the other men--like the army's captain (Kevin Sorbo)--are greeted with a kiss (he claims that this is the Spartan custom, although I never saw anyone else doing it). A Persian emissary (Method Man) experiences this ""welcome"" firsthand when he arrives with a threat: Xerxes, the King of the Persians, plans to take control of Sparta. ""Why don't we talk near the Pit of Death?"" Leonidas suggests, leading the emissary to a gigantic hole. You won't be surprised to learn that many people are pushed into it, from a half-crazed, half-bald Britney Spears to Sanjaya to the entire ""American Idol"" panel (all look-alikes, of course).

Leonidas and his army of thirteen (instead of three-hundred) go off to war by joining arms and skipping the entire way. Upon their arrival, the finally meet King Xerxes (Ken Davitian), who the narrator correctly describes as looking like the fat guy from ""Borat."" The ensuing battle between the Spartans and the Persians relies less on killing and more on upstaging the enemy; they first compete in a dance competition inspired by ""Stomp the Yard,"" after which they tell a number of Yo Mamma jokes to each other. By the time the battle progresses to actual killing, we already know that something even sillier lies ahead. There's a point at which the fighting turns into a game of ""Grand Theft Auto,"" and so help me, I actually found that funny, with the jerky motions and the historically inaccurate weapons surrounded by a blue bubble. But the funniest moment of all involved the size of Xerxes' army, which is far less than the thousands he boasted about--he has a blue screen brought in, explaining that his soldiers will be digitally added in post production.

I could continue describing the specifics of the film's humor, but I think you get the idea. From the ads alone, it's obvious that ""Meet the Spartans"" is just as mindless and dirty as many of our more recent parody films, like last year's ""Epic Movie."" The only difference is that this new film actually manages to be funny at the same time. How it achieves this, I'm still not entirely sure. It could be that it parodies films, television shows, and news events from a year ago or less; the fact that it makes fun of Britney Spears' head-shaving and Anna Nicole Smith's death makes me wonder how long ago principle photography ended. Or it could be that ""300"" is loaded with things just begging to be spoofed, not the least of which are the homosexual undertones. ""Meet the Spartans"" milks that for all it's worth, even in the case of Dilio (Jareb Dauplaise), the army's only fat soldier (who at one point has six-pack abs painted onto his stomach).

Whatever the reason, the simple and difficult-to-admit truth is that ""Meet the Spartans"" is not the God-awful film I was expecting it to be. I found myself laughing, despite the crudeness, despite the bad acting, and despite having no plot other than a series of jokes. While it will never trigger a parody-film renaissance, it will at least get us through the next couple of months, at which point another one will be released. Until then, I'll remember this film's end credit sequence, which has the characters singing a rousing rendition of ""I Will Survive.""",1201219200,14,5256,4.752464403066813

3168008,1,B00177Y9ZW,"If you liked ""300,"" then don't watch this movie.  I was hoping for a spoof that kinda followed the basic storyline of 300 but really it just has some guys dressed like Spartans and a guy dressed like Xerxes and a bunch of random jokes about movies that were current at the time.  The only good things about this movie was that it had Kevin Sorbo (from Hercules The Legendary Journeys) and Diedrich Bader (from the Drew Carey Show) in it and they actually delivered some decent performances.  Carmen Electra was thrown into this movie as well, I'm assuming because it's in her contract to be in these movies or she really needed a paycheck.

Do yourself a favor, don't pay to watch this movie, it's just a waste of time and money.  It's not even really funny.  And the jokes that are thrown in are just there to be like, ""Hey look!  This other movie came out recently, here's us poking fun at it!""  For example, Ghost Rider shows up and does nothing, the camera just cuts to him, they have a 15 second slap stick sketch and it's back to the Spartans.  Megatron from the Transformers shows up for like 20 seconds, and then it's back to the Spartans.  Shrek shows up, says something funny and it's back to the Spartans.  It's like a hour and a half episode of Family Guy with just a bunch of cut aways.  All that's missing is Peter Griffin saying, ""You think that's bad?  Remember when I...""

3168049,3,B00177Y9ZW,"It was funny the first time. It was a few chuckles and whatnot the second time. The third time onward made me feel like a dropped a few IQ points for even watching this movie in the first place. When you watch a parody, you really expect a good laugh each and every time you watch it... just enough to make you laugh at the original movie while you attempt to re-watch it.

 as of the third time, this movie made me feel stupid for trying to poke at 300. After I realised that pop culture and ancient civilisation do not mix, I felt stupid to even re-watch any points past the American Idol crossover parody (and it's technically not a spoiler because the trailer showed it at one point.)

If you really find this repeatedly amusing, I get it - humour is all you care about and it's fine. I love a good laugh myself, but when two themes do not mix and attempt to make a laugh each and every time I watch it, then it's not worth a chuckle.

The 1.85:1 video quality was very detailed, but had a fine grain, and I don't understand how such a recent movie could have grain (I thought they filmed all new movies digitally).  There was so much detail, the skin of the people, and there was a lot of skin in this movie, looked gross with all of the imperfections.  I only give the video quality of this movie an 8.2 on a 10.0 scale.

The DTS-HD 5.1 Master Audio was adequate; nothing special.

The movie only lasted about an hour and 10 minutes.  The credits started at a hour and 8 minutes.  When I watched this on satellite a year of two ago, I thoroughly enjoyed it.

3168122,4,B00177Y9ZW,"Could you imagine three hundred Spartan warriors fighting against one million Persians? Well, this is not the case...
 Instead, the flick ""Meet the Spartans"" mocks ""300"", including aspects like funny characters, a script full of humor and criticism to many Hollywood stars and TV shows.

 The movie starts describing Sparta, a land of warriors. When a baby was born, if the elders find any imperfection, the baby was rejected; but if not, he would be trained since an early age like Leonidas (Sean Maguire). He was sent into the wild to learn how to survive; he confronted Happy Feet, a dangerous creature, and returned to Sparta as a king. Then, he wed Margo (Carmen Electra), the sexiest girl of this ancient land, and she bore him a fine son who was strongly trained by his father, King Leonidas.

 Xerxes, an evil man who has taken over the world, sent a messenger to disturb the peace of the habitants of Sparta and to inform that he wants Sparta to be his final conquest. Obviously that does not get the approval of Leonidas, and the messenger was thrown into the pit of the death, a big hole which is as awful as it sounds.

 King Leonidas decided to go to war against Xerxes and his massive Persian army; but first, he had to consult with the prophets. They told him that he and his men will surely die in war. Without caring about this, he assembled an army with the bravest warriors and went to fight to the end for the freedom of Sparta...

 ""Meet the Spartans"" is a critic to many famous actors, television programs, Hollywood movies, and even restaurants and brands. The film makes fun of Britney Spears, Paris Hilton and Lindsay Lohan's unstable lives. It also mentions shows like ""Ugly Betty"", ""Heroes"", and ""American Idol"" saying that they are boring. Finally, the movie classifies Subway sandwiches and Budweiser beers as awful and disgusting.

 The script is well developed and with lots of jokes. We can laugh every five minutes, but if have not seen ""300"" and do not know some famous people, you will not understand it too much. Another essential ingredient is the funny characters that make a good connection among them, making this movie enjoyable.

 ""Meet the Spartans"", a Regency Enterprises presentation, recommended for young adults and teenagers (don't watch it with your parents!). Rated R for sexual scenes and strong vocabulary. Running time: 86 minutes.",1311811200,,2384,4.799511002444988

3168141,1,B00177Y9ZW,"1. PENGUIN SQUATTING ON LEONIDAS (Sean Maguire). The penguin from ""Happy Feet"" nutted his mouth and defecated on his face...that is all.

2. 'CLOSET' JOKES. ""Taking it from the rear and pounding them from behind"" are just one of many obnoxious, blatant gay jokes this movie has, including male Spartans locking lips as a formality.

3. CHILD ABUSE HUMOR.  Granted, this is not as insulting as those in ""Freddy Got Fingered""; in fact, they're painless.  But the physical association with this humor happened so often, and in extreme ways (back-breaking wrestling moves, golf clubs, chainsaws), that this humor was close to being tasteless.

4. SANJAYA AND CHRIS CROCKER. Who is Sanjaya, and why is he a target for a joke? I'm annoyed by how extremely current the referential jokes are, and how irrelevant they become for the next five minutes.  Same goes for the infamous 'leave Britney alone'. The directors are being lazy in adding an internet video in this film.

5. MID-CREDITS SEQUENCE. I'm amazed that this film's only 60 minutes long, with 50 minutes of filler. But just to add even more time, the film decided to add additional scenes after the cast credits; they're not outtakes, they're just extra crap from earlier scenes. Why couldn't the crew added them inside the story? Not like they would screw the film's pacing since the pacing's screwed to begin with.

What's truly banal about Movies like this is their utter sameness.  It's rather difficult to make a distinctive criticism for each [blank] movies, because they're essentially the same crap, but in different coating (do you prefer the turd brown, greenish-brown, green?).  As I said, I hated the padding of this film, which makes it a lot shorter than it really is; this is like the ""Family Guy"" of live-action films (same could be said for the other films). Sean Maguire wasn't bad as a Leonidas look-a-like, but he wasn't enough to lift the film from its awful grounds.

After seeing all of the [blank] Movies at this point, I come to know difference between the sayings ""this movie is terrible"" and ""I hate this movie"". Yes, Date/Epic/Spartans/Disaster Movies are all terrible by their lack of substance and talent, and I don't doubt that the newest film ""Vampires Suck"" would be akin to the IMDb Bottom list as ""Inception"" is on the IMDb Top list. But do I hate these films? No. Despite such ugliness and horrible jokes, none of the Movie characters were really unlikable, and these films never truly push the limits of bad taste (even in their Unrated editions). And by consecutively watching them, the stench eventually loses its odor. In the end, I see Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer as a couple of attention-grabbing, immature brats throwing their toys around: the best way to deal with them is simply ignore them. If only I was this tolerant to ""Freddy Got Fingered"".",1282089600,2,2849,4.865702479338843

The pit of death (american idol), top model, and deal or no deal sequences seem out of place (even for a parody) and last far too long. In fact, any of the modern-day inclusions only hurt the movie. The movie was strongest when the jokes were centered around 300. I cracked up when Leonidas was sparring with his son. I guess my biggest complaint was the ongoing gay joke. That might have worked 20 years ago. It's not a complaint from a tolerance perspective, it's just that we've seen it done before... too many times.

But my cousin had left it at my apt one night, and since I had nothing but time to kill, I went ahead and popped it into the dvd player, figuring that I could at least make fun of how bad it was. WRONG! This movie was so awful that I couldn't even bear to watch it, let alone make fun of it. Being a fan of movies such as 'Airplane!' and 'Not Another Teen Movie' I can appreciate and enjoy a good parody, but all the producers of this movie did was take an awesome film like '300' and crap all over it. It's got no originality, even for a parody. It's style of so-called humor is a never-ending string of jokes about bodily fluids/functions and lame attempts at poking fun at pop culture...which is fine in small or at least tasteful doses, but this movie's got so many pop-culture jokes that the movie itself is nothing but that: one big pop-culture joke. Comedy is my favorite genre so I normally enjoy most comedies, especially since I'm known as 'the girl that laughs at everything'..but this movie barely even made me crack a smile. In fact, the only thing possibly funny about this movie is the fact that Kevin Sorbo and Carmen Electra's careers are so fledgling that they decided to actually be seen in this movie. If I were either one of them, I'd rather let my career go and slip quietly out of the limelight (at least I'd do it with class and leave my career on a good note) than have people remember me associated with this pathetic excuse for a comedy.

The actual story of the courageous Spartan defense of the pass of Thermopolae...The Gates of Fire...is an fabulous tale of patriotism and heroism.  It didn't deserve the comic, male model treatment as depicted in ""The 300"".  Evidentally the producers/directors of ""Meet the Spartans"" felt the same way and spoofed the special-effects monstrosity posing as contorted history.

The last scene, shown as the credits are being reeled off, is a dance scene...""I WILL Survive!""...by the various weird characters in front of equally weird 'American Idol' judges.  The judges get into the whole thing themselves with some doing kicks and gyrations from their judges' chairs.  It is highly reminiscent of one of he last scenes...also a dance scene...in ""Rocky Horror Picture Show"" in which the characters all get into tights and wiggle around.  Even the formal and objective, Dr. Scott, as a kind of objective witness, gets sucked up into the sexuality of the whole thing, bursts into song and lifts his 'paralyzed' leg to discover, to his amazement, it is also clad in tights.

Well, the ""Rocky Horror"" analogy is there but this film isn't the same weird masterpiece.

They made fun of the movie themes, characters, and story line. They even made fun of famous celebrities such as Britney Spears, Paris Hilton, Linsey Lohan, and others. They mocked the movie in every way possible, and they did a great job at it I must say.

3168189,3,B00177Y9ZW,"""Meet The Spartans"" is just one more of a long line of spoof flicks that attempts to cash in on the popularity of other films (in this case, ""300"" was the primary target).  Unlike many of its contemporaries (""Date Movie,"" ""Epic Movie,"" etc.), though, this film did manage to pull a few laughs out of me.

From the Pit of Death scene that makes many of our dreams come true by eliminating a number of modern TV, music and film stars (and Dane Cook), to the meeting with the Oracle (who happens to be Ugly Betty), this film is silly and light from the word go.  Somehow it works better for me than the rest of the spoof movies that have been around.

Granted, there are plenty of moments in this film that are just too silly, but they are spread out enough that they don't wear on the nerves too much.  In particular, I found Leonidas' training of his son to be quite funny.

The cast includes Carmen Electra, Kevin Sorbo, Diedrich Bader, Ken Davitian and Jim Piddock.  Considering what type of film this is, they did a good job of keeping a straight face throughout.

Sophomoric, idiotic and dumb are all fine adjectives to describe this film.  But what did you really expect?  I consider nothing more than a rental, but if I had to buy a copy of one of the recent spoof flicks, this would be the one.",1233964800,5,1300,4.3347107438016526

It's not intelligent humor, or bathroom humor or slapstick humor or satire or...whatever kind of humor is left.  It's not even silly.  It's just some kind of rambling exercise in how not to make a movie.  Even a take off on another movie or movies has to have some level of coherence.  Look at Monty Python and the Holy Grail.  That was totally silly, but it at least had some kind of plot to carry along it's nonsensical way.  'MEET THE SPARTANS' does not even insult the viewer's intelligence.  It just assumes the watcher has no intelligence.  And, oh my god, Kevin Sorbo. Somebody must have something on him to get him to be in this mess.  No way would he do it for the role or the money.

This movie didn't even get me to smile.

The jokes were more than predictable, in the way that I knew where the punch line was going long before they even started saying it.

Actually the movie seemed to sense my complete boredom and started throwing cheap bathroom humor and vulgar things in hopes that I would keep my attention to it.

Many scenes I felt didn't even belong and were there just for the sake of trying to keep audiences entertained.

The actors are flat in their deliverance of the jokes and the characters they make themselves to be are so completely ridiculous that it's not even funny. The various ""culture"" references they make are annoying and nothing new. I've seen WAY too many of these jokes in other comedy films.

If you've seen the movie trailer or commercials, and think this movie keeps that humor they show, don't be deceived. What the commercial/trailers show is about all the funny it gets. (and that didn't even get me laughing) The rest is just blah.

Overall, it's a copycat of what so many comedy movies are now. It's forgettable and a waste of money to buy or rent!

Meet the Spartans follows in the footsteps of Epic Movie, Date Movie, Shriek if You Know What I Did Last Friday the 13th, and the Scary Movie series, in being a parody of several films including Shrek, Borat, and the Transformers among others as well shows like American Idol though as the title implies it does focus on the 300.
It is a humorous movie with a good casting, even though some of the dialogues could have been better.
The girls are also a great addition; Carmen Electra was HOT as Queen Gorgo and the Hooters girls were NICE as well.
Overall, far from being a masterpiece, Meet the Spartans will provide for an evening's entertainment especially if one is in a really silly mood and/or intoxicated. 3.5 Stars",1230163200,3,906,4.463855421686747
3168194,2,B00177Y9ZW,"I saw this when it first came out. I loved Frank Miller's ""300"" and I love parodies of things I like. I laughed quite a bit the first time I saw this movie, mainly that Sean Maguire looked a lot like Leonidas but with braces. The homosexual overtones were extremely funny. Plus, having Cameron Electra in your movie as the 'hottie' is never a bad thing. But the movie really comes to life the second watch, when you realise the movie wasn't as funny as you thought the first time.

The plot goes along the lines of ""300"" pretty much. They have men with turkey baked tans weilding swords. There's a lot of slow-motion camera views, but I think it was a little overdone. This could have just been a parody to the way ""300"" actually was filmed. Actually, if you haven't seen ""300"" a few times, you probably won't even get 95% of the jokes.

Most of the parodies go along the line of MTV/reality spoofs. Aside from the main theme, they parody movies about break dancing, parody celebrities like Paris Hilton, and then American Idol. While the American Idol portion is funny, it's really, really dragged out in this movie. There's at least 5 different scenes of Idol parody that are all the same, but a different celebrity kicked into the Pit O Death each time. This happens a lot in this movie, and is probably the main reason the movie sucks the second time. When the parodies arrive, they're funny in a sense, but when they drag on for 10 minutes of the movie, it's not so funny. Especially the dancing portion of the movie. I didn't really see the humor in it. It just looked like they copied scenes from other movies and threw them in there. I'd say the best parody was directly from ""300"" in which a slow motion battle scene is shown, and Leonidas slaps a guy in the face with a towel. That's about it.

For being an unrated film, I didn't see anything really different from the first time I saw it. I'm almost certain there wasn't anything really different. As for the quality on Blu-ray, of course, it looks good. The sounds are great, and there's a good amount of bonus features, but seriously, who's watching the bonus features on this movie?",1229904000,2,2147,4.471938775510204

Suffice it to say that this slapdash mixture of gladiator-movie cliches and truly lame pop culture references has enough homophobic jokes to set the cause of gay rights back a good quarter of a century or more (OK, these Spartan warriors like men; we get it, we get it!).

Indicative of the movie's utter failure at pacing and timing are two scenes - one at the ""pit of death"" and another featuring a step-dance competition between the Greeks and the Persians - that drone on for a minor eternity.

3168219,3,B00177Y9ZW,"REGARDING THE MOVIE ITSELF:
Being a fan of ""300"", I reluctantly agreed to see this movie at the urging of my older brother. My actual statement to him when he picked up the box at our local video rental place was ""Are you kidding me?! Sean Maguire couldn't carry Gerard Butler's codpiece... Let alone fill it.""

However, I was pleasantly surprised by and actually enjoyed ""Meet The Spartans""... There are a few slow spots in the movie that just aren't that funny, but there are others that are hilarious. Ultimately it is what it is: a spoof movie.

If you enjoy movies like the ""Scary Movie"" franchise, and it's spin offs... Then consider ""Meet The Spartans"" a distant cousin.

I would also say that while it's not required to see ""300"" before you see ""Meet The Spartans"", it would be beneficial. Roughly 85% of ""Meet The Spartans"" specifically parodies ""300"", so having a knowledge of what's being made fun of can make the jokes that much more funny.

REGARDING THE ""UNRATED PIT OF DEATH EDITION"" DVD:
This ""special edition"" isn't very special. A growing trend that saddens me, and I blame it largely on the push to convert to Blu-Ray. The special features found on this disc would be expected (at the very least) on a standard edition DVD. Disappointing as a ""special edition"" anything.

There was one pop cultural reference that wasn't included, but should have been kicked into the ""Pit Of Death"": The Paparazzi... Now THAT would have made this a 5 STAR MOVIE!",1217462400,,1465,4.70703125

There was ONE scene where I laughed, and that was the ""Ugly Betty"" scene. Epic Movie was very poorly made, yet it had a few laugh-out-loud moments. Did I enjoy Date Movie at all? No. Neither did I enjoy this.

These are the rules of making a good spoof:

1. Be timely. A joke about Ellen in Mr. Wrong??????????

2. If trying to be offensive, be funny too. An accident-prone protagonist in Superhero Movie was funny, assaulting a Spartan kid with many heavyweight objects is not.

3. Widen your humor sources when cracking the odd joke. Go everywhere, don't stay on the same topic just with different words.

4. Be subtle when making a spoof. Not everything has to be uncalled for.

5. Don't go outside the genre you're spoofing. American Idol? Shrek? Casino Royale? Really??????

And lastly...

6. DON'T EXPLAIN EVERY SINGLE SOURCE MATERIAL AND RIFF. If you have to explain everything (Scary Movie 4 was brilliant because it only did this once), chances are it's not funny.

MTS doesn't do any of this, it just does the exact opposite. There's no plot (or so to speak), it's too unfunny to be a comedy, too spoofy to be a spoof, and overall, too unsubtle to be a comedy in the first place.",1216857600,7,1297,4.485106382978723

The main movie only runs for about an hour, then it's credits and this stupid American idol 300 the musical thing... i'm sick of these damn cast sing along's these movies do, this one wasn't poking fun at it, it was just doing it...lame... for someone who cant stand American idol or any Idol for that matter, it was a waste of time to sit through that.... then it goes into... i dunno, alternate/outtakes or something?.

I did get quite a few laughs out of the film and I didn't regret renting it, afterwards. It's not the film that I could watch more than a few times, but I think that I could rent it every so often when I'm bored and need something to lighten my mood. I especially liked the scenes at the end, placed in the spot where a number of film put their outtakes. I was glad they were put there, otherwise those particular gags would have grown tiresome. I was pleased at Carmen Electra's part in the film, too. Aside from being very hot, she did a good job in this comedy film.

But, there were a few things I didn't like about the film. The near-constant gay jokes grew stale pretty quick. But, what did you expect?

Some of the gags were funny, at first, but rather than just doing a gag and then going to the next one, they just overdid it sometimes.

Altogether, I'd say this is a film that is good for some laughs and I believe that is all the director and producer were trying for. They never set out to make ""Gone With The Wind"", they only wanted to make a spoof comedy and that is all they did.

*A large number of parodies and loads of pop-culture satire.
*A few tidbits of original comedy as well (love the way the Spartans prance around gaily...)
*The actors fulfill their respective parts well.

The Bad Things
*Extremely shallow storytelling (although I suppose it's not important for this kind of film anyway).
*As funny as some of the pop-culture parodies are, it seems like you get bombarded with them relentlessly, and it gets a little tedious.  Some of it doesn't even make sense (like Spiderman meeting Trump).
*It's also very short.  Total running time is like seventy minutes with another ten or twenty minutes of credits and outtakes.
*One or two of the jokes seemed overly long to me (especially the ""Stomp the Yard"" number).

The Questionable Things
*A fair amount of perversity.  Not as graphic as ""Scary Movie,"" but enough to make it very low-brow.  Some people may like it, some won't.

This film makes fun of ""300"" and a jillion other films and pop-culture references.  It may be good for one or two laughs, but there is very little originality to any of it, and there's certainly no good story in it either.  I found it very dumb overall, and would only reccomend it if you really like senseless comedy, or if you really wanted to see a ""300"" parody.

Based on the comic novel by Frank Miller, the story it told was of the valiant warriors who stood 300 strong against the invading Persian army at Thermopylae in 480 BC. While it took days for them to be defeated, it takes mere minutes for their story to be butchered in this film.

From the writers and directors who gave you EPIC MOVIE, one of the worst spoofs ever conceived, comes another poorly crafted film that fails almost as much as that one did. Granted, there are a few moments that offer some laughs in this film but for the most part, they are few and far between.

The film follows scene by scene the original it was based on from the youth of leader Leonidas to the decision to go to battle to the confrontation between the Spartans and Xerxes, the leader of the Persians. The difference is that this one is played for laughs...well it attempts to play it for laughs. Instead we are presented with vulgar jokes and far too many references to today's teen tart idols.

Britney Spears image appears far too frequently as does Paris Hilton. It's not that they are rife for a ribbing or that their appearance in a film about a different time period is off, it's just that it happens over and over again and offers lame jokes that have been bled to death before.

The film also spends far too much time on both AMERICAN IDOL and a showdown between the Spartans and the Persians via stomp the yard style dancing, When you consider that the movie last perhaps 60 minutes and that 5-15 of those are spent on these, it is way too much time wasted.

Did I really say 60 minutes? When the film has an 84 minute running time? You read right. Around the 60 minute or so mark, we see the cast on the AMERICAN IDOL stage dancing away as the credits roll for the stars of the show. And as those names finish, we are treated to another 17 minutes worth of scenes that didn't make it into the movie.

There are a few good things though. The acting was well done by star Sean Maguire in the lead. His comedic talents were wasted but do shine through at various moments. Also stand out was Kevin Sorbo of Hercules fame. To see this macho image skipping down the road was enough to induce a few laughs. Showing what little skill as an actress she has is Carmen Electra. She's beginning to look a bit older and it isn't treating her well, especially when her sole claim to fame is as a sex goddess.

If you love spoofs you'll want to at least give this one a watch. If you loved EPIC MOVIE then you'll love this one. But if what you are looking for is a good time on a Friday night watching a funny movie, know that this one is sporadic at best.",1214524800,,2713,4.2563106796116505

I should have just bought him an XBox360.

This is an ammmmmmazingly bad parody movie. Painfully bad. The kind of bad that embarrasses yourself for being in the same room as it. And he was laughing all the way.

It seems like most of the 1-star reviews have never watched a single episode of American Idol or played Grand Theft Auto or anything else that this movie parodies.

While the plot of this movie is shallow, if you are a big pop culture fan, I don't see a reason why you shouldn't like this movie.

This movie also overdoses too much on toilet humor as well as overly trying to gross you out.  The movie is only 83 minutes long, so if you are into pop culture and looking for a quick laugh, this is definitely a good movie to see.

There's no setup. There's no nothing. If this is what has come of hollywood spoof comedies... I'm done... and now that we've seen a long string of these comedic failures pour out into the theatres and people actually pay for them... legitimizing them... we'll probably see more.

Thousands of scripts are written every year that should be funded and produced before trash like this. When a supposed comedy does nothing but make this viewer angry... it's awful.

The problem is though, just like Date Movie and Epic Movie before it, the gags and jokes just aren't funny, and the end result with Meet the Spartans is certainly worse than either of the aforementioned spoof flicks, which in itself is really saying something.

3168285,3,B00177Y9ZW,"Meet the Spartans is a laugh out loud hilarious parody to last year's movie 300, with the addition of parodies to several other blockbuster movies, TV shows, and commercials!
The movie itself is nothing short of hilarious, it accurately pinpoints all of the things that people didn't like about the movie 300, (including historical inaccuracy, ridiculous outfits, and over-the-top combat sequences) and spoofs them in the most accurate & funny ways imaginable! The writer of Meet the Spartans obviously did his homework, because every joke hits it's mark and never leaves you scratching your head about what just happened.

The only people I can think of who wouldn't be able to appreciate Meet the Spartans, are the hardcore fans of the 300 movie, or the kind of people who hated other spoofs such as The Naked Gun & Hot Shots.
If you hated movies like The Naked Gun, Hot Shots, Space Balls, & Robin Hood: Men in Tights, then you probably won't like Meet the Spartans either.

If I were just rating the movie itself, I'd give it 4 out of 5 Stars right here and now, but unfortunately I'm reviewing the DVD too, so no such luck...
My issue with the DVD rests within the version I bought, the Pit-of-Death Unrated Version.
The Unrated Version contain some highly pointless and immature scenes that really hurt my experience while watching Meet the Spartans.
Had I have watched it at the age of 14, I would've found it hilarious, but now that I'm an adult man, ball jokes just don't hit their mark with me anymore...

And for those scenes which contained such stupid, childish, and immature content, I'm going to have to give the Pit-of-Death Unrated Edition of Meet the Spartans 3 out of 5 Stars, which I feel I'm being quite generous with, considering that said scenes were so pointless & stupid that I felt like giving it 2 Stars.
When are Hollywood & major film distributors going to realize that the addition of crude, pointless, and immature scenes is going to appeal only to younger audiences, and ruin the experience for the older and fully matured viewers?
The movie was better in it's original PG-13 version, the added scenes only served to water down the experience of the movie itself, and make the older and more mature viewers feel stupid for watching it.

Steer clear of this version and buy the original Theatrical Version instead, it's actually more entertaining and funny in it's original form, this version is just dumb.",1212537600,5,2437,4.767772511848341

3168297,2,B00177Y9ZW,"`Meet the Spartans' is so obviously a parody of `<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/300-Blu-ray/dp/B000Q6GX5Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">300 [Blu-ray</a>],' it makes us step back and look at the `Matrix'-like sword and sandal movie as though it had been meant to be a joke in the first place.  They get many of the action scenes down right to the slow-mo digital editing, but this is by far the most impressive imitation in the film.  The trouble is this cumbersome comedy has too much collateral damage in its wake.

Besides `300,' the movie drags nearly every pop culture trend with it.  There's text messaging in ancient times, and everyone from a Britney Spears look-alike to a Simon Cowell imitator are found here.  Lumbering along, everything from `American Idol,' `Ugly Betty,' `Stomp the Yard,'  and `Grand Theft Auto' go along for the march.  I was thinking of a comparison, and all I could come up with is `<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Airplane/dp/B00004Y62W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Airplane!</a>,' a classic, which parodied all the `Airport' movies of the `70's, but stopped along the way to poke fun of the likes of `Saturday Night Fever'.  The thrust may be done the same way, but the results are not nearly as rewarding.

The bulk of the comedy comes from repetitious jokes about body parts and body fluids.  I liked an opening scene when Leonidas's household is receiving potential Spartan warriors and Shrek's heir shows up and gives him a fluid spray in exaggerated proportions to the `<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Shrek-The-Third-Full-Screen-Edition/dp/B000UVKGQ2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Shrek The Third (Full Screen Edition)</a>&nbsp;dream sequence.  I did not go into this film as a prude, or I wouldn't have entered in the first place, but the sight gags start to lose their intended force after a while.

As you might expect, there are several lusty jokes about sexuality, both hetero and gay, to match the warriors with leather pouches and the scantily clad beautiful women.  As the men go off to battle they hold hands and sing Gloria Gaynor's ""I Will Survive"" prancing off to fight the Persian Army.  A nice touch is how they add the character Dilio (Jareb Dauplaise), an overweight warrior, who doesn't fit the Spartan entry description.  The film also reminded me of Mel Brook's `<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Robin-Hood-Men-in-Tights/dp/B000G6BLW4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Robin Hood - Men in Tights</a>,' one of his weaker films, which was often better than this one.

One of the best scenes is their parody of  `<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Spider-Man-3-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B000UR9T8C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Spider-Man 3 (Widescreen Edition)</a>'.  Dietrich Bader who plays the unsubtle Traitoro becomes the Sandman to Queen Margo's (Carmen Elektra) Spiderwoman and becomes no force to be reckoned with--only to have the added indignity of a cat coming by to use his remains as a litter box.  One of the weaker scenes was the battle confrontation where they trade cheap insults:  ""Yo' mama is so hairy, the only language she knows is Wookie."" Etc.

They still manage to keep to the parodied plot despite the diversions.  Leonidas (Sean Maguire) leads his Spartan crew to fight King Xerxes (Ken Davitson) even after a foreboding oracle tells him not to.  Then, there's a lot of lust and treachery.

Inquiring minds want to know:  Does he or doesn't he?...
...use a body suit?

I investigated the matter on the Internet, and I found that star Sean Maguire looks buff, but as much body training as actors get, I was skeptical that his cut look was for real.  In one of his lines, he says, ""The oracle also said that our painted-on abs look fake,"" so funny or not, the evidence points at some modified enhancement.  On a TV show, a female interviewer once asked Ricardo Montalban if he had worn a body suit in `<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Star-Trek-II-The-Wrath-of-Khan/dp/6305910189/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Star Trek II - The Wrath of Khan</a>'.  Maltoban was so insulted, he browbeat his interviewer senseless.  Don't tell me it's not important.

(""Let`s cut the fat,"" a stupid line from `The Biggest Loser,' about the only thing that isn't made fun of here:  It had me laughing, although its presentation and delivery are substandard for a comedy parody film.  It seemed repetitious even with a 1:18 show time.)

Premise: Fool please! Next!

Opinion: The movie mainly spoofs 300 but it takes time to skewer Happy Feet, Shrek , American Idol and Stomp The Yard. This movie being short is the least of its problems. It tries too hard to be funny and every time spoof movies try too hard to be funny they will fail miserably. The penguin pooping in Leonidas's mouth is not funny it's gross as is Xerxes played by the same fat sloppy guy who played Azamat in Borat. You know a spoof is trying too hard when you can tell what is going to happen next before it even happens. Who didn't see a skewer at Stomp The Yard coming when that soldiers headed by Method Man came along? Dont lie, you know you saw that a mile away so just stop it. I only laughed twice: when the chick from Mad TV played Britney and got kicked into the pit of death and when they parodied Tyra Banks and her famous reply to those tabloid for showing pictures of her while she was chubby. Every other joke was yawn inducing and every gay joke fell to the ground like Johny Fairplay. I mean there is nothing funny about a bunch sweaty men dancing to Donna Summers' I Will Survive. They're trying too hard. In closing don't waste 80 minutes of your time on another unfunny spoof.

3402447,4,B00177Y9ZW,"It now seems as if over the top parodies are increasing in popularity; the past two years alone has seen the release of ""Date Movie,"" ""Scary Movie 4,"" ""Epic Movie,"" and ""The Comebacks."" We now have ""Meet the Spartans,"" a vulgar, slapstick spoof that the characters openly admit is a cheap rip off of ""300."" It also takes grain pains to exploit reality TV, with ""American Idol,"" ""America's Next Top Model,"" and ""Deal or No Deal"" all being mocked at one point or another. Considering how disappointing ""Scary Movie 4"" and ""Epic Movie"" were, I was greatly surprised by how often I laughed during ""Meet the Spartans."" It might have something to do with ""300,"" a film I thought was brilliant; ""Meet the Spartans"" is not brilliant at all, but it definitely turns ""300"" into an entertaining farce through its physical humor, a few gross-out visuals, and more gay jokes than you'll probably ever hear in your life.

The plot is ... oh, that's right--movies like this don't have a plot. I can say that it follows many of the same ideas shown in ""300,"" which begins with an old man standing at the edge of a cliff with a baby in his arms. In Sparta, the sickly-looking babies are thrown over, left to die amongst a pile of skulls. The first baby the man holds--an infant Shrek that, of course, vomits all over the place--is the first to go. The second baby is Vietnamese, which is why ""Brangelina gets first choice,"" according to the narrator. The third baby is Leonidas, and we know this because he already has a full-grown beard. As a child, he's trained to become a warrior, and by ""training,"" I mean fistfight sessions with his grandmother; as a pimply teenager with braces, he's left alone in the snowy wilderness to fight a gigantic penguin that talks like a ghetto gangster (and yes, it has happy feet).

As an adult (Sean Maguire), Leonidas is King and the greatest warrior Sparta has ever known. He's also a ""war-mongering, latent homosexual,"" as sung during an on-the-spot beer commercial. He greets his wife (Carmen Electra) with a high-five while the other men--like the army's captain (Kevin Sorbo)--are greeted with a kiss (he claims that this is the Spartan custom, although I never saw anyone else doing it). A Persian emissary (Method Man) experiences this ""welcome"" firsthand when he arrives with a threat: Xerxes, the King of the Persians, plans to take control of Sparta. ""Why don't we talk near the Pit of Death?"" Leonidas suggests, leading the emissary to a gigantic hole. You won't be surprised to learn that many people are pushed into it, from a half-crazed, half-bald Britney Spears to Sanjaya to the entire ""American Idol"" panel (all look-alikes, of course).

Leonidas and his army of thirteen (instead of three-hundred) go off to war by joining arms and skipping the entire way. Upon their arrival, the finally meet King Xerxes (Ken Davitian), who the narrator correctly describes as looking like the fat guy from ""Borat."" The ensuing battle between the Spartans and the Persians relies less on killing and more on upstaging the enemy; they first compete in a dance competition inspired by ""Stomp the Yard,"" after which they tell a number of Yo Mamma jokes to each other. By the time the battle progresses to actual killing, we already know that something even sillier lies ahead. There's a point at which the fighting turns into a game of ""Grand Theft Auto,"" and so help me, I actually found that funny, with the jerky motions and the historically inaccurate weapons surrounded by a blue bubble. But the funniest moment of all involved the size of Xerxes' army, which is far less than the thousands he boasted about--he has a blue screen brought in, explaining that his soldiers will be digitally added in post production.

I could continue describing the specifics of the film's humor, but I think you get the idea. From the ads alone, it's obvious that ""Meet the Spartans"" is just as mindless and dirty as many of our more recent parody films, like last year's ""Epic Movie."" The only difference is that this new film actually manages to be funny at the same time. How it achieves this, I'm still not entirely sure. It could be that it parodies films, television shows, and news events from a year ago or less; the fact that it makes fun of Britney Spears' head-shaving and Anna Nicole Smith's death makes me wonder how long ago principle photography ended. Or it could be that ""300"" is loaded with things just begging to be spoofed, not the least of which are the homosexual undertones. ""Meet the Spartans"" milks that for all it's worth, even in the case of Dilio (Jareb Dauplaise), the army's only fat soldier (who at one point has six-pack abs painted onto his stomach).

Whatever the reason, the simple and difficult-to-admit truth is that ""Meet the Spartans"" is not the God-awful film I was expecting it to be. I found myself laughing, despite the crudeness, despite the bad acting, and despite having no plot other than a series of jokes. While it will never trigger a parody-film renaissance, it will at least get us through the next couple of months, at which point another one will be released. Until then, I'll remember this film's end credit sequence, which has the characters singing a rousing rendition of ""I Will Survive.""",1201219200,14,5256,4.752464403066813

3402505,1,B00177Y9ZW,"If you liked ""300,"" then don't watch this movie.  I was hoping for a spoof that kinda followed the basic storyline of 300 but really it just has some guys dressed like Spartans and a guy dressed like Xerxes and a bunch of random jokes about movies that were current at the time.  The only good things about this movie was that it had Kevin Sorbo (from Hercules The Legendary Journeys) and Diedrich Bader (from the Drew Carey Show) in it and they actually delivered some decent performances.  Carmen Electra was thrown into this movie as well, I'm assuming because it's in her contract to be in these movies or she really needed a paycheck.

Do yourself a favor, don't pay to watch this movie, it's just a waste of time and money.  It's not even really funny.  And the jokes that are thrown in are just there to be like, ""Hey look!  This other movie came out recently, here's us poking fun at it!""  For example, Ghost Rider shows up and does nothing, the camera just cuts to him, they have a 15 second slap stick sketch and it's back to the Spartans.  Megatron from the Transformers shows up for like 20 seconds, and then it's back to the Spartans.  Shrek shows up, says something funny and it's back to the Spartans.  It's like a hour and a half episode of Family Guy with just a bunch of cut aways.  All that's missing is Peter Griffin saying, ""You think that's bad?  Remember when I...""

 as of the third time, this movie made me feel stupid for trying to poke at 300. After I realised that pop culture and ancient civilisation do not mix, I felt stupid to even re-watch any points past the American Idol crossover parody (and it's technically not a spoiler because the trailer showed it at one point.)

If you really find this repeatedly amusing, I get it - humour is all you care about and it's fine.

The 1.85:1 video quality was very detailed, but had a fine grain, and I don't understand how such a recent movie could have grain (I thought they filmed all new movies digitally).  There was so much detail, the skin of the people, and there was a lot of skin in this movie, looked gross with all of the imperfections.  I only give the video quality of this movie an 8.2 on a 10.0 scale.

The DTS-HD 5.1 Master Audio was adequate; nothing special.

The movie only lasted about an hour and 10 minutes.  The credits started at a hour and 8 minutes.  When I watched this on satellite a year of two ago, I thoroughly enjoyed it.

When a baby was born, if the elders find any imperfection, the baby was rejected; but if not, he would be trained since an early age like Leonidas (Sean Maguire). He was sent into the wild to learn how to survive; he confronted Happy Feet, a dangerous creature, and returned to Sparta as a king. Then, he wed Margo (Carmen Electra), the sexiest girl of this ancient land, and she bore him a fine son who was strongly trained by his father, King Leonidas.

 Xerxes, an evil man who has taken over the world, sent a messenger to disturb the peace of the habitants of Sparta and to inform that he wants Sparta to be his final conquest. Obviously that does not get the approval of Leonidas, and the messenger was thrown into the pit of the death, a big hole which is as awful as it sounds.

 King Leonidas decided to go to war against Xerxes and his massive Persian army; but first, he had to consult with the prophets. They told him that he and his men will surely die in war. Without caring about this, he assembled an army with the bravest warriors and went to fight to the end for the freedom of Sparta...

 ""Meet the Spartans"" is a critic to many famous actors, television programs, Hollywood movies, and even restaurants and brands. The film makes fun of Britney Spears, Paris Hilton and Lindsay Lohan's unstable lives. It also mentions shows like ""Ugly Betty"", ""Heroes"", and ""American Idol"" saying that they are boring. Finally, the movie classifies Subway sandwiches and Budweiser beers as awful and disgusting.

 The script is well developed and with lots of jokes. We can laugh every five minutes, but if have not seen ""300"" and do not know some famous people, you will not understand it too much. Another essential ingredient is the funny characters that make a good connection among them, making this movie enjoyable.

3402638,1,B00177Y9ZW,"1. PENGUIN SQUATTING ON LEONIDAS (Sean Maguire). The penguin from ""Happy Feet"" nutted his mouth and defecated on his face...that is all.

2. 'CLOSET' JOKES. ""Taking it from the rear and pounding them from behind"" are just one of many obnoxious, blatant gay jokes this movie has, including male Spartans locking lips as a formality.

3. CHILD ABUSE HUMOR.  Granted, this is not as insulting as those in ""Freddy Got Fingered""; in fact, they're painless.  But the physical association with this humor happened so often, and in extreme ways (back-breaking wrestling moves, golf clubs, chainsaws), that this humor was close to being tasteless.

4. SANJAYA AND CHRIS CROCKER. Who is Sanjaya, and why is he a target for a joke? I'm annoyed by how extremely current the referential jokes are, and how irrelevant they become for the next five minutes.  Same goes for the infamous 'leave Britney alone'. The directors are being lazy in adding an internet video in this film.

5. MID-CREDITS SEQUENCE. I'm amazed that this film's only 60 minutes long, with 50 minutes of filler. But just to add even more time, the film decided to add additional scenes after the cast credits; they're not outtakes, they're just extra crap from earlier scenes. Why couldn't the crew added them inside the story? Not like they would screw the film's pacing since the pacing's screwed to begin with.

What's truly banal about Movies like this is their utter sameness.  It's rather difficult to make a distinctive criticism for each [blank] movies, because they're essentially the same crap, but in different coating (do you prefer the turd brown, greenish-brown, green?).  As I said, I hated the padding of this film, which makes it a lot shorter than it really is; this is like the ""Family Guy"" of live-action films (same could be said for the other films). Sean Maguire wasn't bad as a Leonidas look-a-like, but he wasn't enough to lift the film from its awful grounds.

After seeing all of the [blank] Movies at this point, I come to know difference between the sayings ""this movie is terrible"" and ""I hate this movie"". Yes, Date/Epic/Spartans/Disaster Movies are all terrible by their lack of substance and talent, and I don't doubt that the newest film ""Vampires Suck"" would be akin to the IMDb Bottom list as ""Inception"" is on the IMDb Top list. But do I hate these films? No. Despite such ugliness and horrible jokes, none of the Movie characters were really unlikable, and these films never truly push the limits of bad taste (even in their Unrated editions). And by consecutively watching them, the stench eventually loses its odor. In the end, I see Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer as a couple of attention-grabbing, immature brats throwing their toys around: the best way to deal with them is simply ignore them.

The movie was strongest when the jokes were centered around 300. I cracked up when Leonidas was sparring with his son. I guess my biggest complaint was the ongoing gay joke. That might have worked 20 years ago. It's not a complaint from a tolerance perspective, it's just that we've seen it done before... too many times.

WRONG! This movie was so awful that I couldn't even bear to watch it, let alone make fun of it. Being a fan of movies such as 'Airplane!' and 'Not Another Teen Movie' I can appreciate and enjoy a good parody, but all the producers of this movie did was take an awesome film like '300' and crap all over it. It's got no originality, even for a parody. It's style of so-called humor is a never-ending string of jokes about bodily fluids/functions and lame attempts at poking fun at pop culture...which is fine in small or at least tasteful doses, but this movie's got so many pop-culture jokes that the movie itself is nothing but that: one big pop-culture joke. Comedy is my favorite genre so I normally enjoy most comedies, especially since I'm known as 'the girl that laughs at everything'..but this movie barely even made me crack a smile. In fact, the only thing possibly funny about this movie is the fact that Kevin Sorbo and Carmen Electra's careers are so fledgling that they decided to actually be seen in this movie.

The actual story of the courageous Spartan defense of the pass of Thermopolae...The Gates of Fire...is an fabulous tale of patriotism and heroism.  It didn't deserve the comic, male model treatment as depicted in ""The 300"".  Evidentally the producers/directors of ""Meet the Spartans"" felt the same way and spoofed the special-effects monstrosity posing as contorted history.

The last scene, shown as the credits are being reeled off, is a dance scene...""I WILL Survive!""...by the various weird characters in front of equally weird 'American Idol' judges.  The judges get into the whole thing themselves with some doing kicks and gyrations from their judges' chairs.  It is highly reminiscent of one of he last scenes...also a dance scene...in ""Rocky Horror Picture Show"" in which the characters all get into tights and wiggle around.  Even the formal and objective, Dr. Scott, as a kind of objective witness, gets sucked up into the sexuality of the whole thing, bursts into song and lifts his 'paralyzed' leg to discover, to his amazement, it is also clad in tights.

Well, the ""Rocky Horror"" analogy is there but this film isn't the same weird masterpiece.

From the Pit of Death scene that makes many of our dreams come true by eliminating a number of modern TV, music and film stars (and Dane Cook), to the meeting with the Oracle (who happens to be Ugly Betty), this film is silly and light from the word go.  Somehow it works better for me than the rest of the spoof movies that have been around.

Granted, there are plenty of moments in this film that are just too silly, but they are spread out enough that they don't wear on the nerves too much.  In particular, I found Leonidas' training of his son to be quite funny.

The cast includes Carmen Electra, Kevin Sorbo, Diedrich Bader, Ken Davitian and Jim Piddock.  Considering what type of film this is, they did a good job of keeping a straight face throughout.

3402689,1,B00177Y9ZW,"I'm up for some ridiculous humor any time after a long day's work. I bought this believing it to get me in a light happy mood.

This movie didn't even get me to smile.

The jokes were more than predictable, in the way that I knew where the punch line was going long before they even started saying it.

Actually the movie seemed to sense my complete boredom and started throwing cheap bathroom humor and vulgar things in hopes that I would keep my attention to it.

Many scenes I felt didn't even belong and were there just for the sake of trying to keep audiences entertained.

The actors are flat in their deliverance of the jokes and the characters they make themselves to be are so completely ridiculous that it's not even funny. The various ""culture"" references they make are annoying and nothing new. I've seen WAY too many of these jokes in other comedy films.

If you've seen the movie trailer or commercials, and think this movie keeps that humor they show, don't be deceived. What the commercial/trailers show is about all the funny it gets. (and that didn't even get me laughing) The rest is just blah.

Overall, it's a copycat of what so many comedy movies are now. It's forgettable and a waste of money to buy or rent!
I didn't think it possible, but this COMEDY movie actually put me in an even more depressing mood.

3402690,4,B00177Y9ZW,"I'm going to have to agree with most of the previous reviewers in saying that this is indeed not the best of films compared to other spoofs out there, though by no means is it a flop.
Meet the Spartans follows in the footsteps of Epic Movie, Date Movie, Shriek if You Know What I Did Last Friday the 13th, and the Scary Movie series, in being a parody of several films including Shrek, Borat, and the Transformers among others as well shows like American Idol though as the title implies it does focus on the 300.
It is a humorous movie with a good casting, even though some of the dialogues could have been better.
The girls are also a great addition; Carmen Electra was HOT as Queen Gorgo and the Hooters girls were NICE as well.
Overall, far from being a masterpiece, Meet the Spartans will provide for an evening's entertainment especially if one is in a really silly mood and/or intoxicated. 3.5 Stars",1230163200,3,906,4.463855421686747
3402691,2,B00177Y9ZW,"I saw this when it first came out. I loved Frank Miller's ""300"" and I love parodies of things I like. I laughed quite a bit the first time I saw this movie, mainly that Sean Maguire looked a lot like Leonidas but with braces. The homosexual overtones were extremely funny. Plus, having Cameron Electra in your movie as the 'hottie' is never a bad thing. But the movie really comes to life the second watch, when you realise the movie wasn't as funny as you thought the first time.

The plot goes along the lines of ""300"" pretty much. They have men with turkey baked tans weilding swords. There's a lot of slow-motion camera views, but I think it was a little overdone. This could have just been a parody to the way ""300"" actually was filmed. Actually, if you haven't seen ""300"" a few times, you probably won't even get 95% of the jokes.

Most of the parodies go along the line of MTV/reality spoofs. Aside from the main theme, they parody movies about break dancing, parody celebrities like Paris Hilton, and then American Idol. While the American Idol portion is funny, it's really, really dragged out in this movie. There's at least 5 different scenes of Idol parody that are all the same, but a different celebrity kicked into the Pit O Death each time. This happens a lot in this movie, and is probably the main reason the movie sucks the second time. When the parodies arrive, they're funny in a sense, but when they drag on for 10 minutes of the movie, it's not so funny. Especially the dancing portion of the movie. I didn't really see the humor in it. It just looked like they copied scenes from other movies and threw them in there. I'd say the best parody was directly from ""300"" in which a slow motion battle scene is shown, and Leonidas slaps a guy in the face with a towel. That's about it.

For being an unrated film, I didn't see anything really different from the first time I saw it. I'm almost certain there wasn't anything really different. As for the quality on Blu-ray, of course, it looks good. The sounds are great, and there's a good amount of bonus features, but seriously, who's watching the bonus features on this movie?",1229904000,2,2147,4.471938775510204

Suffice it to say that this slapdash mixture of gladiator-movie cliches and truly lame pop culture references has enough homophobic jokes to set the cause of gay rights back a good quarter of a century or more (OK, these Spartan warriors like men; we get it, we get it!).

Indicative of the movie's utter failure at pacing and timing are two scenes - one at the ""pit of death"" and another featuring a step-dance competition between the Greeks and the Persians - that drone on for a minor eternity.

Pretty much a ""shot-per-shot"" and ""cinematographic-art-direction"" copy of THE 300, this movie fails miserably with bad writing, bad jokes, bad acting, bad casting, bad everything! One of reasons for this reviewer's negativity towards the film is that the subject matter is not as accessible as the other movies to parody. Along with the other failure EPIC MOVIE, this has to be one of the worst movies, in any genre, in recent memory.

3402716,3,B00177Y9ZW,"REGARDING THE MOVIE ITSELF:
Being a fan of ""300"", I reluctantly agreed to see this movie at the urging of my older brother. My actual statement to him when he picked up the box at our local video rental place was ""Are you kidding me?! Sean Maguire couldn't carry Gerard Butler's codpiece... Let alone fill it.""

However, I was pleasantly surprised by and actually enjoyed ""Meet The Spartans""... There are a few slow spots in the movie that just aren't that funny, but there are others that are hilarious. Ultimately it is what it is: a spoof movie.

If you enjoy movies like the ""Scary Movie"" franchise, and it's spin offs... Then consider ""Meet The Spartans"" a distant cousin.

I would also say that while it's not required to see ""300"" before you see ""Meet The Spartans"", it would be beneficial. Roughly 85% of ""Meet The Spartans"" specifically parodies ""300"", so having a knowledge of what's being made fun of can make the jokes that much more funny.

REGARDING THE ""UNRATED PIT OF DEATH EDITION"" DVD:
This ""special edition"" isn't very special. A growing trend that saddens me, and I blame it largely on the push to convert to Blu-Ray. The special features found on this disc would be expected (at the very least) on a standard edition DVD. Disappointing as a ""special edition"" anything.

There was one pop cultural reference that wasn't included, but should have been kicked into the ""Pit Of Death"": The Paparazzi... Now THAT would have made this a 5 STAR MOVIE!",1217462400,,1465,4.70703125

There was ONE scene where I laughed, and that was the ""Ugly Betty"" scene. Epic Movie was very poorly made, yet it had a few laugh-out-loud moments. Did I enjoy Date Movie at all? No. Neither did I enjoy this.

These are the rules of making a good spoof:

1. Be timely. A joke about Ellen in Mr. Wrong??????????

2. If trying to be offensive, be funny too. An accident-prone protagonist in Superhero Movie was funny, assaulting a Spartan kid with many heavyweight objects is not.

3. Widen your humor sources when cracking the odd joke. Go everywhere, don't stay on the same topic just with different words.

4. Be subtle when making a spoof. Not everything has to be uncalled for.

5. Don't go outside the genre you're spoofing. American Idol? Shrek? Casino Royale? Really??????

And lastly...

6. DON'T EXPLAIN EVERY SINGLE SOURCE MATERIAL AND RIFF. If you have to explain everything (Scary Movie 4 was brilliant because it only did this once), chances are it's not funny.

MTS doesn't do any of this, it just does the exact opposite. There's no plot (or so to speak), it's too unfunny to be a comedy, too spoofy to be a spoof, and overall, too unsubtle to be a comedy in the first place.",1216857600,7,1297,4.485106382978723

The main movie only runs for about an hour, then it's credits and this stupid American idol 300 the musical thing... i'm sick of these damn cast sing along's these movies do, this one wasn't poking fun at it, it was just doing it...lame... for someone who cant stand American idol or any Idol for that matter, it was a waste of time to sit through that.... then it goes into... i dunno, alternate/outtakes or something?.

I did get quite a few laughs out of the film and I didn't regret renting it, afterwards. It's not the film that I could watch more than a few times, but I think that I could rent it every so often when I'm bored and need something to lighten my mood. I especially liked the scenes at the end, placed in the spot where a number of film put their outtakes. I was glad they were put there, otherwise those particular gags would have grown tiresome. I was pleased at Carmen Electra's part in the film, too. Aside from being very hot, she did a good job in this comedy film.

But, there were a few things I didn't like about the film. The near-constant gay jokes grew stale pretty quick. But, what did you expect?

Some of the gags were funny, at first, but rather than just doing a gag and then going to the next one, they just overdid it sometimes.

Altogether, I'd say this is a film that is good for some laughs and I believe that is all the director and producer were trying for. They never set out to make ""Gone With The Wind"", they only wanted to make a spoof comedy and that is all they did.

*A large number of parodies and loads of pop-culture satire.
*A few tidbits of original comedy as well (love the way the Spartans prance around gaily...)
*The actors fulfill their respective parts well.

The Bad Things
*Extremely shallow storytelling (although I suppose it's not important for this kind of film anyway).
*As funny as some of the pop-culture parodies are, it seems like you get bombarded with them relentlessly, and it gets a little tedious.  Some of it doesn't even make sense (like Spiderman meeting Trump).
*It's also very short.  Total running time is like seventy minutes with another ten or twenty minutes of credits and outtakes.
*One or two of the jokes seemed overly long to me (especially the ""Stomp the Yard"" number).

The Questionable Things
*A fair amount of perversity.  Not as graphic as ""Scary Movie,"" but enough to make it very low-brow.  Some people may like it, some won't.

This film makes fun of ""300"" and a jillion other films and pop-culture references.  It may be good for one or two laughs, but there is very little originality to any of it, and there's certainly no good story in it either.  I found it very dumb overall, and would only reccomend it if you really like senseless comedy, or if you really wanted to see a ""300"" parody.  I rather wish the Monty Python gang made this, instead of the ""Scary Movie"" guys...

3402758,2,B00177Y9ZW,"In 2006 we were treated to a visual spectacle in the form of the movie 300. Based on the comic novel by Frank Miller, the story it told was of the valiant warriors who stood 300 strong against the invading Persian army at Thermopylae in 480 BC. While it took days for them to be defeated, it takes mere minutes for their story to be butchered in this film.

From the writers and directors who gave you EPIC MOVIE, one of the worst spoofs ever conceived, comes another poorly crafted film that fails almost as much as that one did. Granted, there are a few moments that offer some laughs in this film but for the most part, they are few and far between.

The film follows scene by scene the original it was based on from the youth of leader Leonidas to the decision to go to battle to the confrontation between the Spartans and Xerxes, the leader of the Persians. The difference is that this one is played for laughs...well it attempts to play it for laughs. Instead we are presented with vulgar jokes and far too many references to today's teen tart idols.

Britney Spears image appears far too frequently as does Paris Hilton. It's not that they are rife for a ribbing or that their appearance in a film about a different time period is off, it's just that it happens over and over again and offers lame jokes that have been bled to death before.

The film also spends far too much time on both AMERICAN IDOL and a showdown between the Spartans and the Persians via stomp the yard style dancing, When you consider that the movie last perhaps 60 minutes and that 5-15 of those are spent on these, it is way too much time wasted.

Did I really say 60 minutes? When the film has an 84 minute running time? You read right. Around the 60 minute or so mark, we see the cast on the AMERICAN IDOL stage dancing away as the credits roll for the stars of the show. And as those names finish, we are treated to another 17 minutes worth of scenes that didn't make it into the movie.

There are a few good things though. The acting was well done by star Sean Maguire in the lead. His comedic talents were wasted but do shine through at various moments. Also stand out was Kevin Sorbo of Hercules fame. To see this macho image skipping down the road was enough to induce a few laughs. Showing what little skill as an actress she has is Carmen Electra. She's beginning to look a bit older and it isn't treating her well, especially when her sole claim to fame is as a sex goddess.

I should have just bought him an XBox360.

This is an ammmmmmazingly bad parody movie. Painfully bad. The kind of bad that embarrasses yourself for being in the same room as it. And he was laughing all the way. I guess I'm too mature (aka:old) to find spot-on impersonations funny by themselves without any humorous dialogue behind it. And seeing Kevin Sorbo and Diedrich Bader wallow their way through it, you could actually hear their little-enough-already careers falling down that overplayed ""pit of death"" too. Sort of reminded me how painful it was to see last years tankfest ""Epic Movie"", but much, much worse. And honestly, if you found 300 a bit on the ""lightish"", Spartans puts the ""Hey!"" in ""ghey"".

It seems like most of the 1-star reviews have never watched a single episode of American Idol or played Grand Theft Auto or anything else that this movie parodies.

While the plot of this movie is shallow, if you are a big pop culture fan, I don't see a reason why you shouldn't like this movie.

This movie also overdoses too much on toilet humor as well as overly trying to gross you out.  The movie is only 83 minutes long, so if you are into pop culture and looking for a quick laugh, this is definitely a good movie to see.

There's no setup. There's no nothing. If this is what has come of hollywood spoof comedies...

Thousands of scripts are written every year that should be funded and produced before trash like this. When a supposed comedy does nothing but make this viewer angry... it's awful.

The problem is though, just like Date Movie and Epic Movie before it, the gags and jokes just aren't funny, and the end result with Meet the Spartans is certainly worse than either of the aforementioned spoof flicks, which in itself is really saying something.

3402782,3,B00177Y9ZW,"Meet the Spartans is a laugh out loud hilarious parody to last year's movie 300, with the addition of parodies to several other blockbuster movies, TV shows, and commercials!
The movie itself is nothing short of hilarious, it accurately pinpoints all of the things that people didn't like about the movie 300, (including historical inaccuracy, ridiculous outfits, and over-the-top combat sequences) and spoofs them in the most accurate & funny ways imaginable! The writer of Meet the Spartans obviously did his homework, because every joke hits it's mark and never leaves you scratching your head about what just happened.

The only people I can think of who wouldn't be able to appreciate Meet the Spartans, are the hardcore fans of the 300 movie, or the kind of people who hated other spoofs such as The Naked Gun & Hot Shots.
If you hated movies like The Naked Gun, Hot Shots, Space Balls, & Robin Hood: Men in Tights, then you probably won't like Meet the Spartans either.

If I were just rating the movie itself, I'd give it 4 out of 5 Stars right here and now, but unfortunately I'm reviewing the DVD too, so no such luck...
My issue with the DVD rests within the version I bought, the Pit-of-Death Unrated Version.
The Unrated Version contain some highly pointless and immature scenes that really hurt my experience while watching Meet the Spartans.
Had I have watched it at the age of 14, I would've found it hilarious, but now that I'm an adult man, ball jokes just don't hit their mark with me anymore...

And for those scenes which contained such stupid, childish, and immature content, I'm going to have to give the Pit-of-Death Unrated Edition of Meet the Spartans 3 out of 5 Stars, which I feel I'm being quite generous with, considering that said scenes were so pointless & stupid that I felt like giving it 2 Stars.
When are Hollywood & major film distributors going to realize that the addition of crude, pointless, and immature scenes is going to appeal only to younger audiences, and ruin the experience for the older and fully matured viewers?
The movie was better in it's original PG-13 version, the added scenes only served to water down the experience of the movie itself, and make the older and more mature viewers feel stupid for watching it.

Steer clear of this version and buy the original Theatrical Version instead, it's actually more entertaining and funny in it's original form, this version is just dumb.",1212537600,5,2437,4.767772511848341

3402794,2,B00177Y9ZW,"`Meet the Spartans' is so obviously a parody of `<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/300-Blu-ray/dp/B000Q6GX5Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">300 [Blu-ray</a>],' it makes us step back and look at the `Matrix'-like sword and sandal movie as though it had been meant to be a joke in the first place.  They get many of the action scenes down right to the slow-mo digital editing, but this is by far the most impressive imitation in the film.  The trouble is this cumbersome comedy has too much collateral damage in its wake.

Besides `300,' the movie drags nearly every pop culture trend with it.  There's text messaging in ancient times, and everyone from a Britney Spears look-alike to a Simon Cowell imitator are found here.  Lumbering along, everything from `American Idol,' `Ugly Betty,' `Stomp the Yard,'  and `Grand Theft Auto' go along for the march.  I was thinking of a comparison, and all I could come up with is `<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Airplane/dp/B00004Y62W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Airplane!</a>,' a classic, which parodied all the `Airport' movies of the `70's, but stopped along the way to poke fun of the likes of `Saturday Night Fever'.  The thrust may be done the same way, but the results are not nearly as rewarding.

The bulk of the comedy comes from repetitious jokes about body parts and body fluids.  I liked an opening scene when Leonidas's household is receiving potential Spartan warriors and Shrek's heir shows up and gives him a fluid spray in exaggerated proportions to the `<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Shrek-The-Third-Full-Screen-Edition/dp/B000UVKGQ2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Shrek The Third (Full Screen Edition)</a>&nbsp;dream sequence.  I did not go into this film as a prude, or I wouldn't have entered in the first place, but the sight gags start to lose their intended force after a while.

As you might expect, there are several lusty jokes about sexuality, both hetero and gay, to match the warriors with leather pouches and the scantily clad beautiful women.  As the men go off to battle they hold hands and sing Gloria Gaynor's ""I Will Survive"" prancing off to fight the Persian Army.  A nice touch is how they add the character Dilio (Jareb Dauplaise), an overweight warrior, who doesn't fit the Spartan entry description.  The film also reminded me of Mel Brook's `<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Robin-Hood-Men-in-Tights/dp/B000G6BLW4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Robin Hood - Men in Tights</a>,' one of his weaker films, which was often better than this one.

One of the best scenes is their parody of  `<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Spider-Man-3-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B000UR9T8C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Spider-Man 3 (Widescreen Edition)</a>'.  Dietrich Bader who plays the unsubtle Traitoro becomes the Sandman to Queen Margo's (Carmen Elektra) Spiderwoman and becomes no force to be reckoned with--only to have the added indignity of a cat coming by to use his remains as a litter box.  One of the weaker scenes was the battle confrontation where they trade cheap insults:  ""Yo' mama is so hairy, the only language she knows is Wookie."" Etc.

They still manage to keep to the parodied plot despite the diversions.  Leonidas (Sean Maguire) leads his Spartan crew to fight King Xerxes (Ken Davitson) even after a foreboding oracle tells him not to.  Then, there's a lot of lust and treachery.

Inquiring minds want to know:  Does he or doesn't he?...
...use a body suit?

I investigated the matter on the Internet, and I found that star Sean Maguire looks buff, but as much body training as actors get, I was skeptical that his cut look was for real.  In one of his lines, he says, ""The oracle also said that our painted-on abs look fake,"" so funny or not, the evidence points at some modified enhancement.  On a TV show, a female interviewer once asked Ricardo Montalban if he had worn a body suit in `<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Star-Trek-II-The-Wrath-of-Khan/dp/6305910189/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Star Trek II - The Wrath of Khan</a>'.  Maltoban was so insulted, he browbeat his interviewer senseless.  Don't tell me it's not important.

(""Let`s cut the fat,"" a stupid line from `The Biggest Loser,' about the only thing that isn't made fun of here:  It had me laughing, although its presentation and delivery are substandard for a comedy parody film.  It seemed repetitious even with a 1:18 show time.)

Premise: Fool please! Next!

Opinion: The movie mainly spoofs 300 but it takes time to skewer Happy Feet, Shrek , American Idol and Stomp The Yard. This movie being short is the least of its problems. It tries too hard to be funny and every time spoof movies try too hard to be funny they will fail miserably. The penguin pooping in Leonidas's mouth is not funny it's gross as is Xerxes played by the same fat sloppy guy who played Azamat in Borat. You know a spoof is trying too hard when you can tell what is going to happen next before it even happens. Who didn't see a skewer at Stomp The Yard coming when that soldiers headed by Method Man came along? Dont lie, you know you saw that a mile away so just stop it. I only laughed twice: when the chick from Mad TV played Britney and got kicked into the pit of death and when they parodied Tyra Banks and her famous reply to those tabloid for showing pictures of her while she was chubby. Every other joke was yawn inducing and every gay joke fell to the ground like Johny Fairplay. I mean there is nothing funny about a bunch sweaty men dancing to Donna Summers' I Will Survive. They're trying too hard. In closing don't waste 80 minutes of your time on another unfunny spoof.

I was bored the other night and decided that I wanted to go back and watch one of those parody movies from the 2000s. Not sure why since most of them were on the not so good side but here we are. So I decided with this one since it has Kevin Sorbo in it. That is more than enough of a reason to put myself through this again.

The movie is a spoof of 300 and follows that storyline basically with the Spartans fighting the Persians. Throw in moments from other movies and pop culture and you have what every spoof flick was doing at the time. In fact this film was written and directed by the same duo that made the Movie franchise, Scary, Date, Epic, and Disaster among other parody flicks. In fact they were writers for Spy Hard and the first two Scary Movies so they do have some good flicks to their credit, in fact I think I liked Vampires Suck, need to re watch it.

So this is one of the better ones thanks to Sorbo and Sean Maguire and some actual funny moments. One of the best parts is the Britney Spears part, loved it. That part always cracks me up and it was cool seeing Method Man in this, forgot about that. The special features are good but it is the fun commentary [that includes Sorbo] that really makes this DVD worthwhile.
