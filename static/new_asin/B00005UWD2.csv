1669089,2,B00005UWD2,"Ever since I was little, I have absolutely loved unicorns. When I saw this DVD advertised here on Amazon, I looked into it and found what looked like a good movie with an interesting plot. The story revolves around a little girl, Polly, whose old mare gives birth to a unicorn foal before dying. Polly soon comes to love the foal, of course, and pretty soon her love and loyalty are tested when a bunch of greedy circus people attempt to steal the unicorn for publicity purposes. I decided to give the movie the benefit of the doubt and bought it sight unseen.

I guess I should have paid more attention to the negative reviews, because corniness was only one of this movie's faults. For starters, the depth of the story I had hoped for simply isn't there; the movie's tone is so completely juvenile, I expect only really small children would appreciate it. The characters are occasionally a stretch of belief; the heroine sometimes annoyed me instead of rousing my sympathy, and the so-called villains seemed to be nothing more than morons who were placed in the story to be made fools of. The leader of the circus was a greedy jerk, but there's not much more to be said for his character as far as effectiveness goes. The rest of the ""bad guys"" were embarrassingly goofy; Daniel Stern was more terrifying in the ""Home Alone"" series than these guys. The only truly good point of the film was the unicorn, although he certainly couldn't save the film all by himself. Even he, however, had a few downfalls. As an adult, the unicorn is realistically played by a real horse, with a gorgeous glowing effect that magnifies his magical appearance. When he first appears as a foal, however, he is not played by a real horse but created with bad animation. The flying scenes were awkward as well and somewhat took away from the magical effect of the unicorn. The ending of the movie was abrupt and rather awkward, trying to patch a bunch of different resolutions together in one scene (more than one character had some sort of dilemma going on).

All together, this film tried to be moving but was mostly meant to be a typical entertainment kid flick. Nothing wrong with that, and I think my original review was overly critical; the film's decent, just not very broad in its intended audience. I guess it depends on what you're looking for.",1137024000,12,2332,4.6168674698795185
1669090,4,B00005UWD2,"If your child is learning about allegories, this is a good illustration. Polly learns that her mare is dying in birth and prays for help to the unicorn that guards horses in horse heaven.  A male unicorn is born; when Polly hugs it, her scraped knee is healed. The unicorn is the focus of three groups of criminals who want to steal it. A particularly cruel circus master wants the unicorn to do tricks in his circus. He puts the unicorn on display in his circus, whips it and tortures it to do what he wants.  Polly and her friend rescue the unicorn. In the end she sets it free, where it flies into the sky and disappears, releasing its magic over the earth.  The animation of the just-born unicorn foal soon after the story starts is awkward, and my eight-year old was disappointed. But when the movie switched to a real horse ""actor"", graphically enhanced as a unicorn, she was entranced. There's slapstick with the devious horse-nappers that is out-of-sync with the rest of the story, but kids don't seem to notice this jarring switch.",1106524800,21,1040,4.580645161290323
1669091,2,B00005UWD2,"E.T. and Elliott ride across the moon... Oh, wait. This corny unicorn flick is just a rip-off of that children's classic. The ""E.T."" is a mythical one-horned horse named Spike, and ""Elliott"" is a little girl named Polly (Brittney Bomann). When Polly's mare foals Spike, she is desperate to shield him from covetous eyes but before long a nosy reporter finds out about the magical beast and it's a chase that goes into the very sky.

1669092,5,B00005UWD2,I loved this video. It made me laugh and cry at the same time. The most I liked about it was there was no vulgarity or nudity etc. in it. Joe Penny was wonderful. This was the main reason for buying the video. I am such a big fan of Joe Penny. I think everyone should watch it. The kids would love it. Just fantastic.,1018310400,9,317,3.8923076923076922

7955718,2,B00005UWD2,"I idly watched this atrocious peice of trash one day for lack of things to do. I thought I'd just watch a sweet unicorn film. Unfortunately, I had to watch this bizzare interpretation of ""the mystical bond between unicorn and girl"". The unicorn foal resembled a cross between a neopet and a Barbie horse; why did they make it a cartoon? I must admit, the adult unicorn was rather impressive, but the rest was ridiculous. The little girl, Polly, was a flat, one-sided character with absolutely no character, and the so-called ""villains"" were a bunch of pathetic no-hopers; I think the main point of those characters was to provide crude humor to younger children. It didn't really work, though. Then there was a big debate over why the little girl should go to boarding school. I think this was the script writer's way of mixing in another hurdle for Polly to overcome. It was pointless, though. Overall this was a corny attempt to make a classic that really did not work. Only reccomended to children five and under, who only understand how pretty the unicorn is.",1137196800,,1063,4.720430107526882
