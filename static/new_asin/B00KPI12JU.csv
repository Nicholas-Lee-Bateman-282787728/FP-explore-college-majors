6437446,5,B00KPI12JU,"Honestly, I'd rate this at 3 stars but I had to offset the really bad reviews.  Seriously, a movie with dragons is criticized for making a few minor mistakes in historical accuracy?  Considering the lack of budget, as evidenced by the extremely minimal cast size, the production quality is pretty amazing.  The special effects were good enough to be mostly believable. The acting was pretty good...though not ""big budget"" good. I've seen worse plots, and filmography, too.  Overall, a 3 rating for a really well made 'B' flick.  They had to be operating on a miniscule budget compared to what even the CW puts into a single Flash episode, and for that I say, ""well done!""",1423353600,8,671,4.75

6437449,3,B00KPI12JU,"I was delighted to see this film listed since I love the premise and there have been a couple of good short stories along the same lines (airplanes vs dragons).  But, given the source I didn't expect much and those expectations were completely fulfilled.  This is a deeply silly movie that can be fun if you leave your credibility detector at home.  Basic idea is that Nazi's in North Africa c. 1942  have fielded a clutch of dragons controlled by four attractive Teutonic witches.  Opposing them is the usual top secret elite set of fighters, this time P-51 pilots.  Naturally, the bad guys have a single point of failure that is accessible to the good guys.  The acting is decent and it is pointless to complain about the various shortcomings in setting, dialogue, costumes, tactics, flight characteristics, etc, ad infinitum.  This thing was produced on a shoe string with a minimal cast and looks like it.  Apparently they could only afford one oxygen mask. Almost nothing in this movie is authentic to the period (bombing V2 sites in 1942?).  In fact it comes as a surprise when something authentic to the period (e.g. M1 rifles) shows up.  However, if you ramp up your willing suspension of disbelief and just roll with it it is fun, especially if you enjoy nitpicking.  There are a whole bunch of nits to pick.

6437450,3,B00KPI12JU,"Read most of the reviews. One clearly describes the story without giving away too much detail. Based on its description I challenged myself to watch the movie. Normally a movie of this type wouldn't draw may attention towards my viewing it. With my watching it I guess I expanded my horizon, chuckle-chuckle. Throughout my watching the movie a recurring thought had me wonder how this particular movie maker, director and screenwriter, was able to find funding for his project. On the producer's side I would imagine some market research was considered and perhaps done prior to green-lighting movie production. Quite possibly out there in the world exists a large enough potential audience meriting the production of this movie and others of its sort. At one point in time producer's and executive producer's concluded investing time, effort, toward making this movie made sense. Wondering of them now, do they in retrospect feel satisfied with their making the movie? Thinking of those people who invested money in this cinematic project I wonder if they earned a profit. Furthermore, did they at least earn back the dollar amount initially invested? Looking at the dollar amount asked of a person to purchase the DVD indicates desperation on the part of the production company: recouping funds, priority one.",1420761600,,1311,5.15962441314554

6437454,2,B00KPI12JU,"Warning: This review contains spoilers.

The year is 1942. The place is somewhere in North Africa. The problem: In a move certainly inspired by Raiders of the Lost Ark, somehow the Nazis found a dragon's egg. These dragons reproduce parthenogenically, meaning that one dragon can reproduce herself many times, as can each of her ""daughters."" The dragons themselves are controlled by vrill, Aryan witch women who are psychically connected to the dragons and can command them. Dr. Heinrich Gudrun, a Nazi cryptozoologist in charge of the dragon breeding program and the vrill, has brought all of the adult dragons to North Africa to assist Erwin Rommel and the Afrika Korps by using the dragons to regain air superiority.

To combat the dragons, an American general is dispatched with orders to put together a squadron made up of the best Allied fighter pilots that are available, led by Lieutenant John Robbins, the only survivor of the first fighter squadron to encounter the dragons. The general has the Ghost Squadron (so named because it does not officially exist) in their P-51 Mustangs lead the dragons into a trap made up of a whole lot of flak guns. The guns get a couple of them. One of the pilots manages to shoot down one of the dragons and mark the location before he runs out of fuel and is himself killed by the dragons. Lt. Robbins and three of his buddies go to the shoot-down site to see what they can learn about the dragons and are captured by German soldiers, who take them to see Field Marshal Rommel.

The Herr Feldmarschall is very dubious about the dragons. He is not only uncertain that the vrill can keep the dragons under control, but he has serious reservations about the loyalty and ultimate objectives of Dr. Gudrun. Furthermore, he has learned that once in a very long while, the parthenogenic females will lay an egg that hatches out a MALE dragon.  These incredibly rare males are so powerful that the legends say they herald the end of the world, which Rommel explains actually means the fall of a civilization, saying that one male dragon had laid waste to the Carthaginian Empire, and another had accelerated the fall of the Roman Empire. He is afraid that a male egg is developing in Dr. Gudrun's incubator complex, hidden under a mountain. He gives Robbins the location of the incubator and explains how it can be taken out from the air. The key is that Rommel has an inside man who can open an air vent that lead directly into the incubator. All the Allied pilots have to do is put a bomb down the vent, and the incubator and the eggs will be destroyed. Armed with this information, he lets the four pilots go.

The American general recruits a B-17G from an antisubmarine squadron to handle the problem of a down-the-stack shot. Gudrun send all his remaining dragons up to stop the Flying Fortress; the Ghost Squadron, escorting the Fort, keep the Nazi dragons at bay long enough for it to bomb the incubator and destroy the eggs. It turns out the ""inside man"" is actually a woman -- one of the vrill is a British agent. With the eggs destroyed and the adult dragons all killed, the war will proceed with conventional weaponry.

As I said, an interesting premise. The problem with the movie, which I have little doubt will soon appear on Syfy if it hasn't already, is with the execution.

The one positive thing I can say of the CGI airplanes is that the CGI team learned from the mistakes made by Pearl Harbor; the Mustangs behave like real Mustangs and not like X-wings. The B-17G acts like an immaculately maintained Flying Fortress of the Commemorative Air Force. Just two itty-bitty problems: first, the P-51 Mustang was not operational during the North African campaign, and did not reach combat squadrons until 1944; and second, the B-17G, the final iteration of the Flying Fortress, wasn't even on the drawing board yet. This likely won't bother the average viewer, but to someone who knows World War II aviation history, it completely destroys the Believability Factor.

Then there is the matter of the uniforms. On the Allied side, the costume designer had the pilots wearing coveralls that would not have been available there and then, and without insignia of rank. And while we are on the subject of insignia of rank, one of the British fighter pilots is consistently addressed as ""Flight Lieutenant,"" yet is shown wearing Wing Commander stripes on his eapulettes. And the general running the operation, so addressed, speaks with an American accent, acts like an American, but is not wearing the silver stars on his collar that would mark him as an American general. Instead, he is wearing the British red-and-gold general officer's collar patch, but with no insignia on his epaulettes. This BEGS explanation.

And on the German side, the Germans are either running around in winter tone uniforms, or they are wearing uniforms that are total fantasies with the insignia on backwards or upside down. Plus which, Dr, Gudrun, a civilian, is wearing a Knight's Cross, a medal  not awarded to civilians. By rights, he should have been wearing the War Merit Cross in Gold without swords, which is a ""chest"" medal and not a ""neck"" medal like the Knights Cross of the Iron Cross in its various grades. As with the Allied uniforms, there is no reason for this.

The costume designer for P-51 Dragon Fighter needs to go back to school and learn the rules for uniforms in war movies. And that it putting it charitably. Her negligence (or is it incompetence?) went a LONG way toward destroying the believability of the premise!

As I said, this is a good premise for a science fiction movie, but the execution of the premise leaves much to be desired. Don't waste your time watching this more than once.",1409788800,6,5741,4.741482965931864

Many of us require some believability in our science fiction/science fantasy.  This movie does not provide that.  One reviewer wrote that maybe we shouldn't expect historical accuracy in a movie with dragons.  To the contrary, good fantasy requires the real world details to be accurate to make the fantasy believable.  This movie does not even get the uniforms right.  The plot?  How about the specially selected pilots for the special squadron created to fight the dragons driving out into the desert with no escort.  They go close enough to the German positions that all are captured.  The dialog?  One of the doomed pilots reports his situation and what is happening in the air in a very clear, easy to understand report to his ground control.  Ground contol's reply is to ask what's happening up there.  On the other hand, the special effects are pretty good for a low budget movie and the acting isn't horrible.

Cinematography is excellent throughout the film, actors all deliver first-rate performances, and the pacing of the story and progression toward the climax are as good as any film from a major Hollywood studio.  Yup, the plot line is pretty hokey, but certainly no more so that any other science fiction or fantasy film.

Of course there are quibbles--the deserts of California and Nevada certainly aren't the Sahara, a few bits of 1960's jargon sneaked into the dialog, there was one relapse into horrendously bad PC grammar, and those dragons certainly are not Smaug or even the critters from Game of Thrones--but none of those spoil the fun.",1449705600,,825,5.007299270072993

The acting is horrible and the movie is flawed with many technical faults. In the first encounter with the dragons the squadron loses 4 pilots but the grounded squadron leader later complains that he ""lost three men today"". The German general uniform is incorrect in one case, with the general's rank located on the lower lapel of the uniform tunic instead of up near the collar. The story takes place in North Africa, but the officers are wearing the typical feldgrau (field gray) issue of northern Europe instead of the tan uniforms of the Afrika Korps. The American general seems to have the English general officers insignia on his collar. Another thing I found laughable is that the dragons all have German insignia ""tattooed"" on their wings. The female dragons have the old World War I German Iron Cross, instead of the Balkan Cross (balkekreuz) that all WW2 Luftwaffe aircraft sported. And the huge male dragon has a full swastika on each wing. Another point that seems doubtful even for a fantasy storyline as this, is that the dragons are capable of flying at 450 mph, the top speed of the WW2 P-51 Mustang. The CGI Mustangs looked nice, but that's about the only good thing in this stupid movie.",1430784000,,1324,4.638297872340425

No.  The reason I hated this movie was the terrible audio quality.  When the first scene with dialogue; pilots flying in formation in their P-51s occurs, I thought the robotic voice sound was just a cheap effect to make it sound like they were on radios.  No, the robo voice remained, and the sound boom must have been ten yards away from the actors at times, because I couldn't make out a word of what was said.",1470009600,,712,4.315789473684211
8660564,3,B00KPI12JU,"Decent, low budget sci-fi.

I'm surprised at how bad the reviews are for this type of movie. I'm not sure what people were expecting. I watch a lot of these types of movies and this one is not as terrible as the reviews would suggest. Seriously, how do you criticize a movie that has dragons controlled by Nazi's as historically incorrect? This is just supposed to be for fun people!

The acting is average and the special effects are average which is why I give it an average rating of 3 stars. The plot is a bit on the boring side and the ending is another 'destroy the death star' scenario.

The movie itself is about a bunch of dragons that are being controlled by priestesses that are ruled by Nazi's. The Americans (I'm guessing in North Africa) have to destroy the dragons and destroy all their eggs which are in an underground hatchery. Believe it or not, Rommel assists the Americans because he believes that the dragons will not be able to be controlled, especially the male ones which are supposedly uncontrollable. The P-51 fighter group has to assist a bomber and destroy the hatchery and kill the remaining dragons. It's pretty straightforward. We have the much used disgraced pilot who wants to be a hero scenario with they typical love interest who urges him on. Other than that, there is not much else going on the movie. We get to meet a bunch of hot dog pilots but none of the characters are ever really developed as most die before they get to do much.
