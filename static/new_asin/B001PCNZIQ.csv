8333063,4,B001PCNZIQ,"An interesting comedy DVD. I enjoyed the routines and got some really good laughs.  The artists do provide a different perspective and their observations are funny.  Mostly they avoid ""angry"" comedy which is good thing.  The humor is from observations they make, and poking fun at themselves rather than others which makes it easy to laugh without feeling you will be charged with discrimination.  If you have insights into the various cultures of the artists, you get the additional ""insiders chuckle"" but the routines do not require anyone to have anything but a decent sense of humor to enjoy these performers.  I have played it a few times and shared it with friends.  The material does not force me to do a mental screening before sharing, but each adult should judge suitability to their own tastes.",1284249600,,805,4.882352941176471
