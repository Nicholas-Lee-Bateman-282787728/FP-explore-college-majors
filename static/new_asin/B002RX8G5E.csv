3977691,5,B002RX8G5E,"I saw this at a film festival, and we were all so blown away we gave Colin a standing ovation.  It's funny, enlightening, and lets you know clearly that we ALL can and should do something, anything, for this orb we call home.  I was so inspired I'm trying to arrange a showing for Earth Day week in April.  If you go the website [...] you can sign up to get a showing that week for only $100.  The home DVD can't be shown publicly to groups, so you need a licensing agreement.  Movies are expensive, so I have no problem kicking in 100 bucks to make sure this gem gets seen by as many people as possible.

My only quibble is with the fact that the movie doesn't address the environmental effects of having babies, but Colin explained that the subject was taken off the table by his wife for the duration of the experiment.  They're not claiming to be holier than thou, and most people do seem to want babies.  Not having them is the clearest way to reduce your eco-footprint, seconded by going vegetarian.

3977693,5,B002RX8G5E,"great little documentary, if you can learn to tolerate beavan early on.  it's been said before, he's a lame-o, but it bears repeating.  it's unfortunate the filmmakers were saddled with such a huge obstacle (beavan) as this man totally impacts the film like ""the annoying guy your best friend is dating"".  you just have to suffer thru him.

it pays off though!  schein manages to salvage the film with interesting, intimate shots.  you walk away realizing ""nobody's perfect"", that we are all struggling with ourselves, our ideals, our way of living.

the film gets blasted for not being THE eco-primer on sustainable living. well, it ain't.  and the truth is, it's a better film for it.
you wanna learn how to recycle, be green?  there's tons of info out there, find it.

seeing a man, his family struggle with their conscious, that's a way more interesting story.",1266105600,20,864,4.816326530612245

It's laughable that this book and project in general got the press they did. While I applaud the basic premise, the selling of it is uber-irony at its saddest. There are only a couple of truly profound moments in this movie, the best of which is Mayer's little comment about Colin's wife: ""Michele writes for BusinessWeek; millions of trees are cut down on a regular basis in order to promote their thoroughly fallacious propaganda that American corporate capitalism is good for the people, good for you and me. Now if it's your contention that she makes up for it, that it evens out, because she doesn't take the elevator at your Fifth Avenue co-op, I have to say you're either dishonest or delusional. I mean, if anybody really thought that you were going to have an impact, you wouldn't be getting the attention you're getting.""

Now that's the raw, unvarnished truth we hear so little of. If only there'd been more of it in this doc. But then, a film that honest wouldn't be the panacea that we and our McDonald's culture want to believe in. And who wants to see a film with the (more accurate) title of Not Nearly Enough Impact Man?

Two comments at the end, along with Mayer's acute observations, are the best things here: Colin's thought that if we're not part of a community we don't feel accountable for our actions, and Michele's that after turning off their fridge, a/c, etc, they had no reason to be indoors and that the days outside ""seemed to last forever"". But what really stands out about NIM is both how doomed we are as a nation and planet if a pitifully meager gesture like this project is seen as some sort of ray of light, and what childishly spoiled rotten consumerist brats we Americans truly are.

We're all so anxious to pat ourselves on the back these days for any perceived bit of ""green"" activity, because deep down we're all beginning to realize that we've gone too far with our greedy trashing of the Earth, and that hell is about to be paid. Haiti and Katrina-type events are bound to occur much more frequently and much less fixably, and are doing so, and only an idiot thinks they're completely disconnected from our greed-driven consumer cultures. It was painful to watch this movie and realize that this drop in the bucket is seen as progress--and even overkill, incredibly--by our idiot media like Good Morning America, however well-intentioned (though profit-driven) Beaven's motives are.

The opening scenes are telling and depressing; Michele buys a thousand dollar pair of boots then wonders why, is in a different outfit every time we see her (as in the rest of the movie, so non-consumerist chic), and is so thoroughly self-absorbed and spoiled that I kept wondering why Colin was married to her in the first place. Any progress she appears to have made in the movie feels lost as one watches the ""Scrabble"" dvd extra and listens to her opine about her terrible sacrifices. She claims to have learned from it all but it felt more like she enjoyed the publicity and upcoming money...that's a lot of boots at 975 a pop!

Colin comes off as much more of a rational being, and at least somewhat thoughtful...yet it takes him most of the year to finally put up one tiny solar panel (which was someone else's idea) and to figure out so many other apparently obvious truths that one is left wondering how much thought and research he's really given to it all, short of how he can monetize the situation.

Step one: have a camera person around much of the time! That'll keep it real! Colin laments Michele's love of reality shows...but he then shuts the tv off so she can appear in his reality show. Perfect. As she would say, ""Like, I totally, like, think that's totally, like, I'm not sure. I need a quadruple espresso."" BusinessWeek must be so proud. (Imagine their faces when they first watched Mayer's dead-on speech about their greed.)

While Colin's little daughter, the future and present consumer, wanders about, Colin sits around making a list of ways to lessen his impact on the planet (""Put the kid back in your crotch,"" suggested my girlfriend). Then Mommy wants yet another kid, and he relents as a ""40th birthday present"" to her. Now that's reducing consumption! Make another mouth to feed! This guy is really committed to this ""no impact"" concept, isn't he? Give me a break. Overpopulation is the number one issue behind all of our woes, yet it's never mentioned here, just another example of how self-serving this project is.

It makes me sad to be cynical about a movie with such seemingly good intentions, but it all felt so fake in a self-consciously pseudo-hip Manhattan way. Mayer's brief speech punctures the thin green balloon so swiftly and devastatingly, a moment far truer than what surrounds it, unfortunately. The whole doc is worth seeing if just for that moment of real insight. At least Colin realizes how right Mayer is, even if neither of them is too happy about it.

Then the project ends and the only difference seems to be that they don't have a tv...""but I'm watching it all day on holidays!"" squeals the long-suffering wife. Gosh but it's been hell on her! Their so-called deprivations are a joke. Eating root vegetables! What a noble sacrifice! Sure, billions people a day live on less than that, but hey, they can't buy boots for nine hundred and seventy-five dollars either. They could buy a year's worth of food for their families, though...

These are big steps? Unreal. We need to do a lot more than this, every one of us, and then stop breeding like flies if we can even hope to ameliorate the coming catastrophes. The only intelligent, evolved people I see in this movie are the farmers at the market; the most important part of the whole dvd is on the extra about the bees, when the farmer mentions that GMO plants are quickly killing off the key to all of our farming: bees. Now there's a movie we need to see, and a topic we need to address, like, totally now. But we won't, not until it's too late, as with so many other ""green"" deck chairs we rearrange on our sinking boat while telling ourselves how we're making such a difference.

I really do applaud the realization that we must all change our way of living in America, but this movie and its partial measures, fitfully adopted and then quickly given up, will never effect that change. The title might be apt, though: this kind of halfway for-a-while project really will have No Impact, compared to how fast our planet is falling apart. There are a thousand Micheles ""needing"" Starbucks every day and thinking it's ""green"" to buy things there, to every one of her husband, who's willing to go the real extra steps, if just for a while, and just for his book. That a guy like this gets so much press while almost nobody knows who Rudolf Steiner is says it all.

Steiner and the many other traditional farming/living advocates are the people who deserve movies being made about them, as they've been walking the walk and talking the talk for many decades. 40-year-olds like Colin Beaven, however well-intentioned, who are just now realizing what's up, are waaay behind the curve. That they're presented as ahead of it is merely a harbinger for how bad things are going to get, and how soon.

But then that kind of truth just don't sell...at least not enough to buy a pair of boots for 975 clams.",1265760000,19,7344,4.652274479568234
3977695,5,B002RX8G5E,"This movie totally raises one's consciousness if one is open to admit ""we"" have a problem with an over consumptive, over disposable society. One person affecting his family, affecting friends and community. I liked how Colin struggled to figure everything out, how the movie portrayed hard times, the downside as well as the benefits and upside to becoming conscious of how we abuse the enviroment. His wife's struggles and her comments made the movie all the more real (we could identify). Isabella added flow and innocence, a sense of play and adventure, which is what life is all about, right? I learned and grew from this movie. We pick our battles. I've been a vegetarian for 40 years and didn't realize it was on the list of best things to do to help the planet! Those who complain about the packaging of this movie, do you still eat meat and guzzle gas? The movie says to do what you can. Not lay judgement on what you can't. If you can't buy this product, go see it!!!!  I've watched it 4 times and learned something new each time. PS. Colin and Michelle also set a positive role model for couple's communication.",1265414400,,1121,4.605
3977696,5,B002RX8G5E,"This book easily falls into my top ten books of all time. Colin Beavan is a breath of fresh air with his honesty, willingness to admit occasional defeat, and courage to keep going when sometimes the eco-treadmill gets a bit tiring. His wife should also receive a big pat on the back for being supportive of her husband, even when the devil of self-interest is screaming in her ear. She puts her family first, and deserves the credit for doing so. What I admire about Beavan the most is that he doesn't claim to have all the answers, ecological or otherwise, but he is willing to question his own actions on a minute-to-minute basis, and assess whether something is truly working or not. In other words, he discards practices that prove to be impractical in his own domestic situation, and searches for a better way to perform the task. He does not give up, and his example of relaxed and open activism, encourages those who are looking for a less strident way in which to engage with their communities. No preaching here, just pure fun. I recommend this book highly, and I have made several changes in my own life for having read it.",1265155200,4,1133,4.5588235294117645

I enjoyed reading the book and enjoyed the movie even more.  It's not a nuts and bolts 'How to' movie.  If you want practical 'How to' go to his blog - there are many good links.  It's a wonderful story about how the whole family changes, and changes for the good(at least it seems so to me).  There are many little things each and every one of us can do everyday.  It's simply a matter of thinking about them and then doing them.  I admire the No Impact Family for trying to take personal environmentalism as far as they did.  If you don't test the limits you don't know how far you can go.  They did a year long test and now have to decide which of their changes they will continue with and which they won't.  I'd like to see a follow up story, say a year later - how are they doing?  I recommend this movie to anyone who has ever thought about trying to help the environment and keeps putting it off.

Colin Beavan decides to live meagerly in the heart of NYC for one year so he can write about it on his no impact blog. He drags his wife into this.

3977728,3,B002RX8G5E,"Colin Bevin decided to live for one year making no impact on the environment. His wife agreed, and his daughter was a toddler who seemed to have fun with the whole experiment.

They lived in a New York City apartment on the sixth (I think it was) floor, and walked up instead of taking the elevator. They didn't use cars or buses, but bicycles or walking. They bought their food at the farmers' market using cloth bags to carry it home.

They experimented with a pot-pot, which is a natural cooler. You put a clay pot inside another larger clay pot, with sand between them. Then wet the sand and evaporation is supposed to keep the interior pot cool. It was not adequate to keep milk from curdling, so they compromised on a Coleman cooler and bumming ice from a neighbor who had an ice-maker in her refrigerator.

The hardest thing for me would have been giving up toilet paper. They used rags and washed them out. The toddler wore cloth diapers with fleece-lined diaper covers. Colin had a friend who had a plot in the community garden (the only one growing vegetables instead of flowers), and Colin went working with him.

Laundry? They put the clothes in the bathtub and let them soak in home-made organic soap for awhile, then got into the tub and stamped on them, like crushing grapes. The kid thought it was great.

Along with the practical details of their year-long experiment, Colin goes into considerable detail on his philosophy, his wife talks about her frustrations with the project, as well as her satisfactions, and they spent their vacation at an organic farm upstate.

An interesting experiment, in part for what it said about what can be permanently changed and what is simply not practical. The significant thing is that such change multiplies: Colin was talking about what he was doing, and wrote a book afterward. He inspired other people, not so much to give up everything he had but to find those things they could do to have less impact.

He also emphasizes the importance of community. A kid asked him what one thing he would recommend, and he said volunteer for an eco-friendly organization.

I was intrigued and impressed then as well as now.  While people criticized the heck out of Beavan, I see him as a man who is trying to figure out a way to do better in life.  To quote a wise person, ""when you learn better, you do better.""  While he does deserve some criticism, not all he receives is fair. Even I questioned whether he did this project just to figure out the plot of his next book, but seriously, who commits to a full year of depriving yourself of things if you aren't really in it for the long haul.

Beavan is interesting in the film, but his wife is the person easiest to identify with.  She's drug along by Beavan on this No Impact project and she goes kicking, screaming, and creating laughter.  She really cracks me up with she says ""I need to go fix myself"" when she's trying to negotiate her way into going to get coffee after they've cut caffeine from their lives.  The daughter is awfully cute too.  I love the tag line: ""can you change the world without driving your family crazy?""

All of this to say, I enjoyed the film, I appreciate that Beavan doesn't act like he has all the answers, and shows that ""hey, I'm human and just trying to figure out how to be less damaging to the plant.""

About the shipping: I received my package in good time.  No complaints about the purchasing process at all!",1322265600,2,1483,4.3140794223826715
3977731,3,B002RX8G5E,"Colin Beavan wants to reduce his carbon footprint (he can't actually have no impact) and wants those changes to be big.  Those changes include no shopping for anything new, no ordering takeout, no flying, no T.V., no plastics, no air conditioning, no elevators and even no toilet paper.  Instead, he wants to either use what he already has or borrow what he doesn't.  However, I question the borrowing rule, like borrowing ice.  If hypothetically everyone adopted this change, then who would he borrow from?

During this change, Beavan faces resistance, even from environmentalists who accuse him of giving environmentalists a bad name.  The media isn't supportive either.  When he's on the Colbert Report, Stephen Colbert tells him that although he's on his show, he doesn't support his cause and even thinks it's dangerous.  His neighbor, too, thinks his solutions are dangerous, saying Beavan is only oversimplifying the problem, thus ensuring government won't have to take it seriously.

His wife has concerns about the change, too, and his reaction towards her concerns were insensitive.  For example, when his wife struggles giving up coffee, he won't allow any adjustments in his plan to accommodate her.  However, when HE struggled giving up his laptop, he does make adjustments to accommodate himself.

Another example of his selfishness is when his wife expresses concern over being unable to conceive at 40.  He dismisses her concerns, saying they aren't relevant to his project.  It was as if the only concerns that mattered were his and only his.

In the end, it turns out his changes were too drastic and unsustainable for him.  While I applaud him making an effort to change, had he done more preparation, he might've had a different outcome.",1311897600,2,1757,5.090909090909091
3977732,2,B002RX8G5E,"I don't often write reviews, but this guy irked me so, that I felt I had to give my two cents.

First, he's extremely annoying to listen to and watch. This, however, does not affect my rating of the movie, because it's a docu and he is the guy who did the crazy project.

As many have written, it should really be titled something other than No Impact Man (especially the book, and it's over-emphasis on the ""Man""), because he dragged his family into it with him. If anything, at the end of the film, his wife looks much better than at the start and, if I may, becomes rather like-able; he, however, has thoroughly declined, plagued by bags under the eyes and seemingly depressed. Perhaps it was the stress he put himself through, trying as hard as he might to figure out every possible spin he could put on his story? In any case, I'm sure that most of the rave reviews are from people who associate with the wife, who is definitely the more human of the two or perhaps the child. Beavan, on the other hand, is thoroughly embroiled in a plot to get as much attention as he possibly can through a media-grabbing stunt. Why no toilet paper? 'Cause that'll make people talk! There are some who are convinced that this isn't a stunt. Their conviction is probably based on the whining episodes in the film, in which he exposes how much it hurts him that anyone would think that would do this just for a story. If you were planning to turn off your electricity, and you wanted a way to refrigerate things, wouldn't you try an evaporative-cooling setup before you put all your trust in it? Wouldn't you find out if there is a specific type of pot that works the best? Or would you act like you had just been jettisoned in a city just like yours that somehow lacked all the things you used to rely on, and you must now heroically forge your way through the difficulties of not being able to buy your comfort? There's a difference between trying to be responsible towards the planet and being a nit-wit on a press-grabbing binge. Beavan repeatedly shows that he has no idea what he is doing and no motivation to find the answers. He casts himself into the role of a child on a trail of discovery into the wild world of third-world living (plus a solar-panel powered computer to update his blog and whatever else). Where were the shots of them in the library? Where was his journal, which he would edit and publish after the stunt? His ignorance - real or pretend - was difficult to witness.

For instance, for years now there has been a trend towards sustainable living, 'eco-culture' perhaps, which - as we must all now know, at least, I'd guess, anyone watching a film with such a title - is the new chic. It's fashionable to go green, local, sustainable, renewable. How could he, an only somewhat successful writer, tap into a huge reserve of current consumer sympathy? With a crazy experiment, movie, blog and book, championing a move towards the 'good life' of minimalism, that's how. But no one really wants to see him, which - to his credit - he knows, so he drags his family into it. He must've been aware that people relate far more readily to his wife and child that to him; he's got that bookish, dejected air, with an unhealthy dose of self-importance, one might add.

Another thing that turns me off is that for someone who so fanatically seeks a sustainable, no-impact path, he passes over (or seems to), the prerequisite research into this way of life, passed down to us from a multitude of generations that came before. Instead of educating himself about the different technologies available to him, he seems to rush into a year 'without' completely unprepared. It reminds me of that poor loser in Into the Wild, who thinks he can waltz off into the wild without thoroughly making ready, learning the in's and out's from those who have been there before, and ends up dying from it. Should we admire these people's 'courage' as they rush head-long into folly? Or should we admonish them for their complete lack of foresight and planning? They get so wrapped up in their philosophical search for some sort of meaning, that they not only alienate themselves from those around them, but they forget that many have already been down this path (and lived, and sometimes fairly well at that).

Adding nothing new to our collective knowledge (apart, perhaps, from the fact that Colin Beavan is annoying, and that husbands: before you try this, know that your wife will drop $1000 on shoes), then, what is the appeal of this movie? Well, it's all summed up in the trailer, in those few good shots and that nice, happy, child-playing-in-the-fields music near the end, as Beavan suggests titles that all would have been far more suitable. Even with such a title, however, the story would be lacking.

As a matter of fact, if you have seen the trailer, then you've seen the movie. They used every single shot worth seeing and sound-byte worth hearing in it, in order to get you to watch it. Unfortunately, the rest is just filler.

Two stars because he actually did it, and because his child is adorable. Oh, and I didn't turn it off.",1308268800,8,5130,4.557483731019523

On both ends-the family life and the making of a film itself (regardless of how bad a movie may be it is worthy of a lot of credit)

As for my two cents, I will admit to being a little biased as both being involved in film making and watching a tremendous amount of documentaries
I do not feel the same about Beaven, after sitting through ""Fathead"" he was a treat to watch and listen to
With that said, enroll for a free netflix trial, give this movie a watch, and form your own opinion (hopefully it will make a difference in your every day life as it did in mine!)",1303776000,,707,4.130434782608695
3977735,2,B002RX8G5E,"No-Impact Man is supposed to be a documentary about 1 year in the life of a man named Beavan and his family during which they use only sustainable, non-polluting products.  It was not supposed to be a movie about WHY you should be a no-impact environmentalist, nor a movie about HOW to go no-impact, so I wasn't disappointed that this DVD didn't show either of these things.  Also, Beavan never said that his experiment was in living the only acceptable lifestyle, so I don't fault him for getting solar panels to power his laptop or selling his books.  However, what I did expect was a movie about his experience of living without disposable things, and No-Impact Man didn't deliver.  Instead it is a movie about Beavan and his wife, and some discombobulated moments in their lives.

Example one: The family tries to use a double-bucket system to cool food rather than having a fridge.  But we get from the movie a scene where Beavan's wife is telling him that he doesn't support her because she is willing to use the buckets but he is not willing to have a second child with her.  That's basically a movie about them as a couple, and we don't learn anything like... is the food going bad?  Are the buckets hard to use?  etc.

Example two:  The family stops using toilet paper, using washable pieces of clothe instead.  We get to hear from the wife stories about how some of her co-workers won't shake her hand anymore, etc.  But what was the experience of using the clothe like?  Did they feel clean?  Was it gross to wash the clothes?  No questions like that are ever answered.

I don't know who put this movie together, but they did a very poor job of making the No-Impact Man experiment either interesting or educational.  Hopefully the book will be better.",1303171200,9,1762,4.575079872204473
3977736,3,B002RX8G5E,"This film was interesting and overall worth watching; but I was disappointed there wasn't any supporting information on their chosen methods or how-to. It was basically a reality show about a family simplifying their lifestyle, repetitive justification for doing so, and their increasing popularity along the ride.

I would have liked to see:
- Background on his project plan and how he drafted it
- How he researched and why he chose the methods he chose
- Real answers behind addressing toilet paper, dirty diapers, etc. and I'm not asking this out of perverse fascination. I'm asking it out of sincere interest on how to live without these things.

Highlights:
- I loved Mayer, the gardener's, humor and wisdom
- I enjoyed seeing their solution to laundry
- I liked the information around cleaning products but wanted more info on how to do this myself
- It was nice to see a child be part of this project. I have one and a little one on the way; so it's nice to know it's ""doable"" with babies

Lowest points:
- Didn't care about his numerous talks with national tv shows or his soapbox moments; the point seemed to be overblown
- Because there was so much lack of information and supporting facts he came off as extremely amateur and somewhat ignorant. I can see why some reviewers were annoyed
- His defensiveness around people wanting to know HOW he got by without toilet paper, etc.

My comments about other reviews:
- I feel the criticism behind the question,"" was he really low impact?"" to be essentially irrelevant. That title, ""Low impact man"" is for publicity. This film is really about simplifying a lifestyle and doing what you can to reduce eco impact.
- Some people were confused by his choice to go vegetarian. Apparently, they didn't hear the fact that meat-eating, whether grown locally or not, contributes to green house gases.

Because of these omissions, I feel this film was 3 stars at best and would not recommend the book as from its reviews it doesn't cover these areas either. Despite this, I do feel it was worthwile just to see a glimpse of the lifestyle, from a perspective of wanting to become more self-sufficient and prepared in case the grid went down.",1295395200,4,2186,4.697127937336814
3977737,5,B002RX8G5E,"I saw this documentary some months back on Netflix, and I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed the story of Colin and his family experimenting with less impact. It's not perfect. They live in 5th Avenue (really?), they're feeling their way along in this experiment without really knowing what to do to make less impact and Colin's wife tries but she's really not on board. It's an intellectual pursuit that breaks down in real life, but they keep trying.

But you know, I admire someone _trying_ to do what they can. And following through publicly when you know darn well their friends, family and colleagues think they're nuts. Colin took alot of flack, much like some reviewers are giving about this DVD, that he's only out for publicity. His wife works for Business Week and he's a published author already, so who knows?

But he kept going despite the strong critics and he's still behind his idea today. No one can maintain promoting an idea for publicity over the long haul. It's too hard. Colin not only maintains it, he's more passionate than ever. In the end, he's spearheaded a movement.

The most interesting part of this film is the way we see Colin and his wife, Michelle, interacting. It's a real inside look at a marriage relationship where an outside idea totally throws your life in chaos. What would you do if your spouse came home and says we're going to do this (fill in outlandish idea)? Seeing how they work through the changes and the attention was fascinating. I enjoyed seeing them converse and negotiate a pretty tricky situation that would've put a big rift in another relationship.

I love--much like I love a homemade rustic apple pie--that it's not a perfect set-up and they aren't perfect people. It's encouraging to those of us firmly entrenched in ""normal"" American consumption to see that maybe there's an alternative, if we tried.",1290988800,3,1875,4.777777777777778

I recycled regularly before, and I'm cheap so I don't have a whole lot of crap and have bought a number of things from goodwill in my lifetime... but this movie really made me stop and think.  I think part of it is a ploy to make a lot of money, but I think a large part of it is a crusade to try and get people to stop and think about the ways that they're living and have them ponder about what they would be willing to change or not change.  No one in this world is perfect and it would be easy to find somewhere to point fingers at the author/maker.  The movie let's the viewer make their own opinions about what ""No impact man"" is doing, it doesn't judge anyone for not living the way he does- it just opens people up to the idea that maybe they could change something they are doing.  Watching the movie did get me into learning about a lot environmental factors 1. because it's green and 2. because it's generally cheaper.  I've also gotten sick of the materialistic attitudes of America, and the movie was refreshing to show someone who thinks in this way.  There is a little crazy behind this documentary, but I believe that there is also a lot of genius behind it as well... and it has made a change because it changed me.",1290729600,2,1436,4.218978102189781
3977739,3,B002RX8G5E,"I have to write this review in two parts.  The first part focuses on No Impact Man as a documentary film.  The second is on the message of no impact.

Colin Beavan, for a number of reasons including interest and economics, convinces his partner, Michelle Conlin, to join him in a quest to live a ""no impact"" life in New York City.  Initially, no impact is defined as using locally produced foods, no purchasing new products, minimal waste production, and a fairly low energy consumption.  Their life gets a bit more extreme when they turn off the electricity for six months (except for the solar panel to charge up the computer, as well as the electricity for operating the telephone), thus removing evening lights and the refrigerator.

They are shadowed by a videographer, who documents their activities at the farmers' market, cycling down New York's streets, visiting a local farm, working in a community garden, playing charades with friends, cooking, and sitting at home while discussing the merits of toilet paper, cosmetics, doing laundry in the bathtub, and having another baby.  Their two-year old daughter is a real gem in this film, having the carefree attitude of going with the flow as Colin and Michelle experiment with resource-frugal living.  What kid doesn't love the worms in the compost box, or stomping on laundry like the legendary grape crushes?

You see the tension between Colin and Michelle in making these changes.  Colin clearly is in control, and Michelle is a real trooper, depending on her workday at BusinessWeek to stay sane.  Michelle admits she is not fond of ""nature,"" and she loves her ice and her Starbucks fix (rare, but essential).  However, she learns to cook, obviously puts up with the candles and the lack of her favorite reality television shows, and becomes a believer in using a bicycle to get around NYC.  She wants another baby, and Colin clearly does not.

Colin focuses on his obsession with ""no impact man,"" blogging and researching new things to try.  He admits the economic incentive of producing a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/book/dp/B003P2VD92/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">book</a>&nbsp;(which I haven't read) is important, but he eventually seems sincere in wanting to make a statement regarding the human footprint on the planet (at least in a major metropolitan area).  The film's editor(s) do a nice job at giving the us a view of a complicated Colin and Michelle, although if you were expecting any detailed information of the specifics of sustainable living, this is not the film to watch.

Then there is Colin's mission, to try living a ""no impact man"" lifestyle.  I understand his attempts to recycle, reuse, and reduce, but it is more than a bit hypocritical to present a ""no impact"" persona, and then use his computer regularly.  He failed to discuss how ""no impact"" relates to the medical care needed by Michelle and, I assume, any medical checkups associated with their daughter.  And his use of borrowed products - a three-wheeled bike, a solar panel and battery for his computer - or reused products still have to be associated with their production costs.

What I really had trouble with was the conflict with Colin's ""no impact man"" program and what I view as people truly living a sustainable lifestyle... locally produced food when possible; walking, cycling, carpools, or using mass transit; staying healthy with healthy living and preventative care; energy efficient living (solar panels, appropriate heating and cooling, insulation); and other strategies, as well as talking the talk and walking the walk.  Do you know more people like Colin, or like I just described?  Which of these is the sustainable strategy for 300 million US residents?  True sustainable living is not ""no impact"" living... it is SUSTAINable.

And, as we all know, the energy and resource costs of having a kid in America is very high.  In a year of being ""no impact,"" that should have been part of the discussion for Colin and Michelle.

If, as I believe, Colin was not living sustainability, then he was more like a parasite on his family, friends, and community.  That is not a sustainable lifestyle, and is not a model to emulate.  Locally-produced food for thought.",1288310400,6,4265,5.078909612625538
3977740,2,B002RX8G5E,"This is a poorly plan venture.

If he was really into having no impact, he could have done lot more without impacting his family quality of life.  In fact I do not agree that he is a no impact man.  As he had impacted his family quality of life for his so called venture.

There were other ways that he could have make no impact without impacting his family quality of life.  The following are just a few sample of ways to do just that.

1.  He did not used toilet paper because toilet paper cause the destruction of the forest and trees.  But he does not take into consideration that he puts his family into the discomfort I observed.  He could have used a Bidet.  I purchased a Hydrogienic Bidet for $40 and have used it for the last 4-5 years.  Not only do I save trees & moneys, but it is more Hygienic than using toilet paper.  I would never go back to using toilet paper after using the bidet.  I don't even use the public toilet and only used my toilet because I prefer the bidet.  Amazon does not have Hydrogenic Bidet but here is a similar bidet for $40 on Amazon&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sanicare-900-Bidet-Natural-Water-Bidet/dp/B00429VY8M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sanicare 900 Bidet (Natural Water Bidet)</a>.

2. I also notice that he was using that make shift composter that was unsanitary with flies, ticks & fleas breading from it.  That is unsafe for his daughter and family.  He could have got a professionally design composter such as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Soilsaver-Classic-Composter/dp/B003959G9Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Soilsaver Classic Composter</a>. There are many other kind of composters on Amazon that he could purchased from.

3. As in regard to him using candle light to save electricity.  That is dangerous for his family.  Candle combustion is very inefficient.  It produces pollutions & soots.  Now his family is breathing it in their lungs and it is affecting their health.  He could have use a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Solar-Powered-Camping-Lantern-6V-70-mA-Solar-Panel-12-LEDs-Solar-and-Hand-Crank-8-5-tall/dp/B003CSZ62E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Solar Powered Camping Lantern. 6V/70 mA Solar Panel. 12 LEDs. Solar and Hand Crank. 8.5"" tall.</a>.  This item or similar Solar LED Lantern would have provided him with light all night with free energy from the sun without risking his family health from the pollutions & soots.

4. And he was not using electricity because of the impact it has on the environment.  But he was impacting his family by denying all the comfort that electricity appliances provided.  He could have purchased a plug & play solar panels.  Just installed it on the roof and plug it directly into your wall plugs.  And if he install enough panels & conserved enough electric, he could have had the necessary electricy without impacting the environment.

5. And there is one thing that he did not do that he should have is to grow his own food.  He was buying food from other people.  Whether it was organic or not, it has to be transported and that take oil & gasoline, a petroleum product.  He could have grown his own food with one of the following items&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Topsy-Turvy-Tomato-Tree/dp/B0029WS0RW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Topsy Turvy Tomato Tree</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hydrofarm-EMSYST-Emily-s-Electric-Garden-System/dp/B000053F9E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hydrofarm EMSYST Emily's Electric Garden System</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/EarthBox-RB-EB-TRC-PBB-Garden-Kit-Terra-Cotta/dp/B000JUW8RE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">EarthBox RB-EB-TRC-PBB Garden Kit, Terra Cotta</a>&nbsp;and many other items available for this task.

They show how hard it is to get used to such a life, how much has to be adapted to, and how they become better parents once the TV is gone from the home.
I still do not know what they used in place of t.p., nor do I see much point in living without electricity as long as you don't blast your a.c. or use incandescent bulbs.

3977742,2,B002RX8G5E,"Upon viewing this film, a few things struck me the wrong way about this man. In no particular order, he:

1)Doesn't seem have much respect for his wife.
2)Comes off as a self-indulgent attention whore, who then resents it when attention goes to something he did for no other reason but the attention- ie, not using toilet paper.
3)To segue off of that, he won't use toilet paper, yet his wife works for Business Week, and he takes on this endeavor in order to publish both a paperback and hardback book. Which, you guessed it, consumed significantly more trees than simply using toilet paper in the first place would have.

Also, I'm not quite sure what going vegetarian for a year has to do with eating locally or sustainably, seeing as how locally, humanely raised livestock that fit organic guidelines would've fit their diet just as much as his plan to eat only local, organically grown vegetables.

What saves it from being a one-star film is that, in his own misguided way, he did advocate some things that would legitimately help if people continued to do it, such as supporting your local farmers and producers, riding bikes if one's healthy enough to do so, and limiting our waste; unfortunately, the positives came with a good portion of BS that had to be endured to get there by a man more worried about how many people would think he was awesome than the cause itself, and it's also nothing groundbreaking.

And that little quip about farming not being hard? Charming. That's truly endearing to anyone who's actually done more than twist a garden weasel into the ground to plant parsley where someone else already did the work.

I'm a firm believer in the cause of sustainability, but this tool makes a mockery out of the experiment with haphazard rules he makes up along the way. Where the power came from to make this film in the first place, even in the ""no electricity"" phase, and how he always gets just enough juice to power his blog on simply completes the charade. He was so insecure that his story would be lost, he couldn't even last the 6 months without updating his blog or filming. In essence, ""no impact"" doesn't represent his ultimate goal, but his ultimate fear- that his stunt would be forgotten about so quickly if he didn't make himself available during his fasting of consumerism, that the end result would truly have no impact.

To me, that speaks volumes about the level of faith he actually has in the cause.",1277942400,42,2443,4.65661252900232
3977743,5,B002RX8G5E,"It was nice seeing how a family could completely change their lifestyle for a year and watching the progress of their journey seemed heartfelt and honest. The whole process was not just a straight up breeze in the park. It took effort and lots of adaptation.  Colin and Michelle seemed real and maybe even relatable. I loved Colin's determination and will-power to do as much as he could to leave no impact. Michelle seemed to try so hard to support Colin and follow along with his intense eco-friendly ways.

Some of the eco-friendly mechanisms that they used seemed crazy for any normal consumer, but it was interesting to see their quest and attempt at conquering their goal to not leave an impact.  I felt that throughout the movie, there were some really insightful perspectives regarding the experiment and techniques.

After watching the movie, I was about to eat dinner and started feeling really bad about cooking the noodles wrapped in plastic and using that paper napkin that I would soon throw in the trash can without a second thought.

3977744,2,B002RX8G5E,"I watched only a portion of the dvd and confess that despite bringing little expectation, it nevertheless was a slow uncomfortable, albeit sad, erosion for me. I stepped off where the wife gets pregnant. There was far too much marital reality show, just as Colin feared. But what was more frustrating: far too little explanation on how they reach all the terribly strange arbitrary decisions (no to a fridge but yes to ice???) they made to reach what they considered the ""no impact zone"". In short, too much daydreaming and reacting, not enough solid homework and thinking it through.

From the beginning, the project comes off as ill conceived, grossly lacking in research on the general topic and disorganized as to how to solve even simple situations like hygiene. Case in point -- Colin's pot-in-pot cooler was a failure for Colin's assumption that the very arid climate where they are successfully used wasn't a factor. Not enough thinking. Another even more egregious case in point -- there is no greater impact on Earth to be found than in its overpopulation yet there appears zero consciousness about that displayed in the discussions by either husband or wife prior to their second conception. How does one overlook that?

At some point, it became too difficult to watch the kind of ignorance that doesn't know it is. It brings to mind how one must first understand the entirety of the problem to make successful course changes. Flying by one's pants seat can be humorous but this was merely a sad self indulgent cousin to ""Into The Wild"", which drew a hugely sympathetic reaction from me. It was just as admirable of a goal but with quite the opposite of an admirable application. Fortunately for the Beavans, nothing as essential as survival was ever at stake so all their angst, in contrast to McCandless's dangerous heroics mixed with understandable naivete, comes off as average every day dumbo. If you last the whole dvd, I say bully for you. I couldn't.",1274572800,12,1969,4.857142857142857
3977745,4,B002RX8G5E,"A couple of years ago I ran across a magazine blurb and photograph of a family in big city America attempting to live a carbon footprintless year. I was fascinated but never bothered to check into the book that had just been released.

But when I saw the documentary I had to watch it. I love reality-TV-type journeys of self-discovery.

Colin Beavan ignited a bit of controversy during his journey and some of it came with his interaction with his wife and her agreement to join him in his experiment. I'd say the process ended up costing her a little more as she was a Starbuck's junkie and addicted to shopping. They ended up spending several months eating from various homemade coolers, feeding their garbage to a box full of worms, living by candlelight and without toilet paper.

The obstacles faced and the information gathered by this family was fascinating. Of course there was a bent as in all documentaries. But, overall, the entertainment, educational and voyeuristic appeal was high and it was well worth the time investment. There is a bit of language so parents may want to preview it.",1273708800,,1100,4.7486910994764395
3977746,5,B002RX8G5E,"Excellent compliment to the ""No Impact Man"" book.  Colin and his family are easy to watch.  Normal and intelligent people living with little drama and in a loving way.  We watched this as a family and agreed how fantastic it must have been to give up things throughout the year.  I especially like Michelle's comment about feeling a loss about not wanting things (some such statement).  We really are taught as a country to consume and generate the economy.  I love the idea of rethinking this and finding a more authentic and sustainable way to live.  I don't just mean sustainable for the environment, but for the integrity of our way of being...human beings. Thanks to the Beavan family!  By the way...it's not crazy to go ""without"".  It's a mindset.",1273536000,,753,4.730769230769231
3977747,1,B002RX8G5E,"The no impact man annoyed me deeply on a personal level.  There is something about his entire persona I find offensive.  He appears to be an extremely self-absorbed, self-righteous person. Although I applaud his decision to make no impact upon the planet, he comes across as smug and not very likeable.  The movie reminded me of a bad Seinfeld episode, filled with pretentious, narcissistic, self-centered New Yorkers who think the world revolves around them.

I know Colin and his wife took part in a noble experiment, and the message is one I believe in and think should be encouraged, but both Colin and his wife come across as mean, horrible people.  This film would make good propaganda for anti-environmentalists that shows just how strange the environmental movement can be.  The message could be misconstrued that you have to give up any semblance of a normal life to save the planet - a philosophy that is not necessarily true.

Oh, and did I mention that the movie is really boring?  Sorry, it just wasn't put together in an interesting way.  It may have made an okay one-hour public television special, but even at 90 minutes it was pushing the snooze factor.",1272067200,8,1170,4.81
3977748,5,B002RX8G5E,I love this project and I love this family. The creativity they show in trying to live their values has inspired us to make many changes in our lifestyle and purchasing choices. It is also very fun and funny to watch. Families are hard work and they show a very nice side to the teamwork of problem solving during this project.,1268352000,,327,4.377049180327869

8378945,1,B002RX8G5E,"my first review was rejected by the amazon pc censors....so I'll be kind with this review, this documentary was on the same level as a Michael moore ""documentary"" or al gore's propaganda films. as other I star reviews here asked, what about heating their apartment during the winter, and during the film I've noticed these folks cooking on their kitchen stove. the casual ""statistics"" give in this film are wrong, but my one nagging question is what did they feed their dog during this ""experiment""?",1511136000,,499,4.882352941176471

Some examples of their efforts are actually inspiring and I certainly believe that his experience is worth sharing although not everyone would agree to go on a similar journey... I can only recommend ""No Impact Man"".",1480636800,,358,5.189655172413793
8378950,5,B002RX8G5E,This was just amazing. Hopefully this will wake people up and help them realize that it's important to take care of this planet and to live as sustainable as possible.,1477699200,,167,4.6
8378951,5,B002RX8G5E,"When the star, Colin Beavan, described himself as a ""die-hard liberal"", I was apprehensive because that was so polarizing. But because I live a zero-waste lifestyle myself, I thought I'd give this a try. The storyline is a bit trying at times, with different energy-saving techniques going awry and a marriage that is a little strained from the project, but I came away with several great ideas and a lot of knowledge. Watch this with an open mind, and take notes!",1471996800,,464,4.7407407407407405
