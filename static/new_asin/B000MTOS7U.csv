8172292,2,B000MTOS7U,"This dvd is poorly done and is extremely light on content. The ""emcee"" is clearly reading, quite poorly, a script. He is very stiff. The information is not very detailed and quite frankly, not new nor very helpful. All of this information is available for free by  searching online for information about cocker spaniels.

Some ways this video could have been more helpful:
1. Mention that cocker spaniels can be shown, registered (i.e. AKC, CKC, etc.), that one can simply enjoy them as pets or they can be entered in agility trials, become canine good citizens, etc.
2. You could mention that they are part of the sporting dog group at Westminster.
3. You could mention that they are available as ASCOB, Buff, etc.
4. You might have mentioned how to find a good cocker spaniel puppy - go to a dog show and talk with breeders, look at different puppies and dogs within the breed to get an idea of what makes a well bred cocker spaniel.
5. You might even mention that getting a rescue cocker is another option.
6. Regarding house training - you might talk about how to approach it. An overview of different methods such as crate training.

The only part of the dvd that was kind of useful was the Interactive Basic Training - yet even that could be found on YOU TUBE.

There is just not enough information on this dvd to justify its purchase.",1298332800,3,1341,4.528925619834711
