2664369,3,B000IZJ468,"Great workout, fun set, good steps...only one little problem.

She faces you while doing the steps. It is easy to mix up which direction to step or stand. For a regular workout, this may not be a problem, but for Salsa, not being on the right foot makes the next step impossible. Expert dancers will not have a problem after 1 viewing, intermediate dancers will.

Also just a small thing...but she keep calling me a girl... (Ok girls!) Made me feel like I wasn't suppose to be there. (^.^ )'''' lol",1201132800,3,498,4.461538461538462
2664370,1,B000IZJ468,If any of you really dance Salsa which is danced on the first count (Known as dancing on the ones) then you will be confused by this video. Lisa dances the Mambo which is danced on the second count (Known as dancinig on the twos).  So you have been warned that this exercise video is misleading and will confuse people who dance Salsa.,1199923200,3,335,4.317460317460317
2664371,5,B000IZJ468,"Okay, I'd have to admit I may have exercise ADD if there is such a thing.  I am always on the look-out for new routines or types of exercise that keep me interested and challenged.  This routine is for those that have mastered the basics first.  This is much quicker paced than the first video, but again, the moves are well cued and are like taking a dance class.  There is lots of repetition as you build the patterns and then create the whole routine.  Burn calories?  Oh yes, you will definitely burn calories.  I work out every day, whether it is a dance work out, cycling, Tae Bo, Power Yoga, Pilates, and this made me sweat and kept me moving.  I loved the music and the fact that her instructional segment is on a different part of the dvd, so I don't have to go through that every time I work out.  I just cut right to the routine.  Lisa is obviously a gifted teacher as well as a dancer and her moves are accurate and sharp, keeping good posture and alignment.  If you are looking for a bit of a challenge, and love dance-based work-outs, I would give it a try.  I am definitely always watching for her to come out with new dvds as I always know I will get a routine that works me out, makes me sweat and goes by quickly since her choreography is so fun.",1195776000,6,1264,4.177685950413223
2664372,4,B000IZJ468,"Out of all of the dance inspired workout dvds i own, this is best.  I get a great workout!! The best part of the dvd (in my opinion) is the fact that, after going through the ""workout"", there is a section where you go through the routine 3 times.  when i feel like getting a better and longer workout, i can just jump to the beginning of that chapter rather than ""rewinding"" or starting the routine over.
The reason i give it only 4 out of 5 stars is that it does not give any instruction during the workout.  i don't own the beginner version of lisa's salsa workout, but i dance salsa pretty regularly, so after going through the first time i picked it up easily.. but i found it frustrating that even when she shows the ""bonus"" move... she just taps her left leg and then says forward, back, side etc.  it makes it challenging to convert the move in your head so that you using the right feet for each step (which should be opposite those of the dancers). i read a review where the person suggested watching the breakdown of the steps in slow motion.. this is a good idea for the bonus move especially. (they breakdown the steps really quickly)
aside from lacking a few directions, it is a great cardio workout.  after doing this workout, i find it more difficult immediately jump into other dance dvds because they seem to be at a noticeably slower pace.  this dvd can get you into dancing shape and some of the moves can even be taken to the ""dance floor"".
to sum everything up... this is great for people who either have experience dancing salsa or have worked up to this with the first dvd.  it doesn't get boring like other ""let's take it from the top"" dance workouts because you are dancing the entire time as opposed to marching in place and watching steps at half tempo 20 times. so, if you are looking for a dance dvd that will both bring latin flavor and leave you sweating, this is the workout for you.",1186272000,2,1915,4.332402234636872
2664373,4,B000IZJ468,"I have Kisa's first Red Hot Salsa & other dvd though I haven't played it in years. I did like them, but the Cardio/Hip Hop one I needed more breakdown, but I loved her Salsa ones for when I feel well coordinated & looking to move fast w/o breaks.
This one is the same with even live percussion with the prerecorded music alongside. There are chapter choices, blooper reel, behind the scenes & extra step instruction & 30 second practice.
There are about ~10 diff moves she teaches in the separate chapter which she does at 3/4 tempo & tells you quick cues. She never goes slow!
It starts with a 5 min warm up which is the steps you've already learned in the step tutorial, She starts out full throttle right from the start. Then she stops for a slow, decent stretch for 6 min. Then gets right back into it. You never stop, but do slow down to a cool down after 25 min.
She goes back & forth between the diff moves after only doing them 2x each & cueing well in between though hard to switch back & forth so much, but that will teach you better coordination. I only wish there were more moves, even easy ones that still workout your body & the tutorial being taught at a slower pace.
If you're looking for non-stop great moves, not watered down from a fluid teacher, this is it. If you have 2 left feet or need more teaching, try other latin dancing dvds before trying this.

You can see a trailer for this & her other DVDs at collagevideo",1183939200,7,1438,4.248175182481752

2664375,4,B000IZJ468,"This is a good workout.  I found it helpful to go through the step chapter she had first, and I put it in slow motion a lot to really get the steps, because some of the steps are difficult.  But once you get the hang of hit its good.  Sizzling salsa is easier to learn",1172620800,,268,3.8363636363636364
2664376,5,B000IZJ468,"Style : Salsa exercise

Level : Very fit

This is now the best latin exercise dvd on the market. It is a Salsa style exercise dvd. It contains pure NY shines with some salsa rhythm inspired dance steps. It is a much better routine than her first dvd which was geared towards the beginner market. This dvd is made more for the serious Salsa dancer who is already fit.

For people looking for a salsa shine video this would be a great start.

I must point out you would have to be fit to do this dvd. It is very fast paced.

Buy Lisa's first dvd to prepare yourself for this dvd.",1169424000,,577,4.116071428571429

8148004,5,B000IZJ468,"So, being in pretty good shape already, I was looking for a challenge.

I had reach a plateau and I didn't feel my current dance classes were taking
me to the next level.

This dvd more than met my expectations I know some other reviewers have
mentioned this was hard to follow...it can be in the beginning, but that's what
i liked best about it...!",1399593600,,349,4.3538461538461535
8148005,5,B000IZJ468,"I was seeking a workout that was low-impact, yet intense. I have a background in competitive Latin ballroom dance, and salsa was the very first introduction I had to any kind of Latin dance, so I figured this DVD would be do-able for me. It was, although I admit it took me a good 3 tries before I felt comfortably fluent with the pace and sequence of steps that Lisa Nunziella presents. I enjoyed the rapid progression of moves, the authentic Salsa music and accompanying drummer on the dance floor, and Lisa's good use of proper salsa technique. What she is really teaching are ""shine steps"" for salsa, which is a salsa sequence women usually dance during salsa partner dancing as a way to improvise on the floor when her partner has released her from closed dance position; it allows both partners to ""play"" with the music and show off their own individual technique, rhythm and styling. It is true that she breaks forward starting on the ""2"" count (which is more of a mambo-type standard), whereas true street salsa breaks forward on the ""1"" count, but I've learned both variations and regardless of the count, Lisa's steps are well-timed with the music. She seems to have an intense, somewhat jarring teaching persona, almost like a dance ""drill-sergeant"", and her voice can be loud and jarringly shrill at times, but I didn't mind; she has probably produced the most authentic and fast-paced Latin dance workout available on the market. She also has an extensive background in many forms of dance and is in great shape, and her workout is definitely a mentally (and physically-I worked up a respectable sweat) challenging one for those who have prior dance experience and are coordinated enough to pick up the steps quickly.

Lisa teaches ""add-on"" style, in that she introduces you to a sequence of 4 steps at the start, you repeat the sequence twice, then she introduces a new step to add on. You then repeat the new step twice, then add it on to the original sequence (repeated twice). It goes on, until you have a long choreographed sequence that lasts about a minute-and-a-half, and this final long sequence is repeated 3x to faster salsa music. The warm-up and cool-down sections are fast-paced as well, as she jumps right into doing moderately fast-tempo salsa steps in both sections without any slow movements to ease into the dance. She does offer a stretch section in both the warm-up and cool-down sections, which is decent. The total aerobic workout time is probably about 40 minutes (I'm counting the warm-up and cool-down sections too, since they are faster than average), and the total workout including the stretching sections is about 52 minutes.

I have also ordered Lisa's ""5-Day Latin Dance"" DVD, which I hear is also fast-paced and a good Latin dance-inspired workout for those who are comfortable with the challenge of learning complex steps in short time. Lisa is no-nonsense and serious about her craft, and isn't just there to act/look sexy and seduce the camera while dancing; she's actually trying to make the experience a dance workout challenge for the audience. She may not be as ""warm and fuzzy"" bubbly as other instructors (but at least she's not making cutesy faces, winking at the camera, and hollering ""Whooo!"" like some other workout dance instructors). She has two other competent backup dancers behind her, and the whole time the camera just focuses on all three dancers doing the routines (no seductive close-ups of the dancers' bodies), so it is easy to see what all three dancers are doing with their legs and arms. I would recommend this DVD to anyone who enjoys a coordination dance challenge (preferably with some prior dance experience), or those who are patient enough with themselves to learn how to dance relatively complex, fast-paced salsa steps.",1294963200,,3801,4.882352941176471
8148006,3,B000IZJ468,"Tough to keep up with!!! Complex footwork, and I'm latin!!! To be fair, I've never done any dance classes, so have no experience in learning coreographed steps (do know salsa, but this is really fast!). I do prefer more kickboxing style or straight traditional aerobics, cant beat those for a good workout. But gotta say, this would be a great workout if you can keep up!!!",1281484800,,373,4.666666666666667
8148007,5,B000IZJ468,"This video is exactly what I've been looking for!  I have a few years' dance experience and wanted some dance DVD's to add to my home workout library, but its been a frustrating search because so many ""advanced"" dance videos are really for advanced beginners.  This DVD is the answer.  If you have any experience dancing, this will be too easy to do every day because it is very repetitive and kind of easy, as said.  Still, its a far cry better than any other ""advanced"" dance dvds I've tried.  Not perfect, but better.  Someone really needs to make a DVD collection of several, truly advanced routines to battle the boredom factor for people who already know how to dance.",1262476800,2,674,4.575

8148009,2,B000IZJ468,This workout video was very hard to follow and it did not get my heart rate up to where it needs to be to burn enough calories. I guess it is a fun workout to do every once in awhile.,1242604800,,183,3.6
