We would actually sing the theme song together, and to my amazement I realized I still remember the lyrics! I saw the theme intro on Youtube and that brought me here in the hopes of getting the DVD of the show so that my young child can view it too.

This DVD contains the first five episodes of Teddy Ruxpin, i.e.
The Treasure of Grundo
Beware the Mudblups
Guest of the Grunges
In the Fortress of the Wizard
Escape from the Treacherous Mountain

Teddy is a great role model for young children - his sense of adventure, justice, and perseverance send kids a positive message. The story itself is filled with enchantment and adventure and is sure to delight a new generation of kids.",1325721600,,832,4.396103896103896

8095547,5,B000C3L2B6,"There can't be a better storyteller than Teddy Ruxpin. As I child I was enthralled with this animated story and would impatiently play with my toy Teddy Ruxpin as I waited for Saturday morning to come again so I could see another episode of the TV series. This show has a clear progression of plot development that starts right from episode one. So many cartoons are just one-shots, an individual small plot for each episode. Teddy Ruxpin was an epic adventure that caught you up and carried you along for a fantastic adventure! Along the way, kids learn important morals, values, and a lot about their own world. This is a fantastic cartoon to share with children of any age. And what a great price! Well worth it!!",1161475200,,716,4.6015625
8095548,5,B000C3L2B6,Teddy Ruxpin was one of my favorite shows as a child.  I had all of the episodes taped on VHS casettes which have just about given out.  I am so glad that they're being released on DVD so that I can share them with my own children.,1157760000,,231,3.893617021276596
8095549,5,B000C3L2B6,"This DVD has the first 5 episodes of Teddy Ruxpin, a popular cartoon series from the 80's! I loved this when I was a kid, and have some episodes recorded that I've watched again and again. It's great to see they're releasing the full series on DVD.

This cartoon was unique in that all 65 episodes followed a developing plot, rather than each episode having a seperate story. This was very uncommon for cartoons in the 80's, and allowed for a much more interesting storyline and character development. Kids will love it, and it's well written enough for even adults to be entertained by it. Teddy is also a very moral hero, and a great example for your kids to follow. And of course, any one who had a toy Teddy or watched this show when they were young will be filled with nostalgia to see it again.

The storyline is just amazing, the characters are fun and memorable, the songs are cute, and the DVDs are at a great price! Each disc has 5 episodes, and they're releasing discs 2 at a time. Discs 3 and 4 are planned to come out later this year. You'll never regret buying this once you watch it!",1140393600,7,1098,4.351219512195122
