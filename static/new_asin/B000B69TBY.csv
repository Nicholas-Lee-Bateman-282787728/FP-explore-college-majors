8082398,2,B000B69TBY,"This plays like one of those films you had to watch in elementary school about brushing your teeth, or eating enough vegetables. I hoped for a really great documentary all about the oil sands, and this isn't it. It spends the first 15 minutes as a travel agent film about Alberta, and wastes most of the rest of its time sounding as if it is a promotional film for the big oil companies. There ARE some redeeming facts and figures, but the low production value and sim city sountrack, combined with the laconic narrator put you to sleep before you can absorb anything useful. Give it a miss.",1190937600,,591,4.481481481481482
