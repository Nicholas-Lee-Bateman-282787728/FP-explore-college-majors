5559571,5,B00B65QKFW,"one of the best documentary IMAX movies out there to date! weve been wanting to see this when it came out but because of another imax animal movie with more money it didn't get  the press or the exposure it deserved and so rightly needed to help protect the arctic. it is so stunning and some of the shots they were able to get were amazing! they were able to follow a momma polar bear and her 2 cubs for 7 days which is unheard of and get info and shots nobody had Ever gotten before! it's backed by [...] and it's amazing.rent it,buy it do whatever you can but do see it, it;s really worth it. for all you polar bear lovers out there this is the movie for you,",1364515200,4,662,4.0534351145038165
5559572,5,B00B65QKFW,"I watched this documentary in the New England Aquarium, it is beautiful.  I cried as well as my girlfriend, it's just touchy.  I've been looking for it ever since, and I found it, and of course purchased it.

Life is rough for the animals in the arctic, but nature is just to gorgeous.

Do yourself a favor and watch it, or buy it.",1361491200,6,331,4.2063492063492065

5559577,1,B00B65QKFW,"If I wanted to hear someone's thoughts on Global Warming I could easily have looked it up on the internet. Only 10 minutes into the movie it goes off on a global warming tirade. Since Man Made Global Warming has never ben proven as fact, (models, schmodels, I have coded many and mine work), I turned off the movie and relegated it to the garbage can. What a waste of money. It should have been titled ""Gloal Warming Assumptions About The Arctic"". Then I would have known not to waste my money.",1428883200,3,494,4.380434782608695

5559579,5,B00B65QKFW,"We love Polar Bears and the scenery was fantastic.  But, leave the friggin politics out of it!  This film is not much different than the one called ""Arctic Tale"" made about 10 year ago!  Same old song and dance.  They also were Global Warming fanatics, yet, 10 years later, the Polar Bears are still here and we're not covered by oceans!  Enough already.  Global Warming is just a scam to line Al Gore's and other liberals' pockets with trillions of dollars!  Liberals tried to pull this same scam back during the depression, look it up.  Roosevelt felt it wasn't the time to burden people that were jumping out of windows because they lost everything.  It was shelved.  Almost 90 years later, we're still here and so are polar bears!
Too bad such nice scenery was wasted on a liberals' opinion!",1427587200,,795,4.614285714285714
5559580,5,B00B65QKFW,Excellent movie depicting the severe problem confronting polar bears as the result of disappearing ice.,1425340800,,103,5.933333333333334
5559581,4,B00B65QKFW,Great for use in a classroom. Great culmination to an environmental unit. The kids loved seeing the cubs playing! Great movie!,1402099200,,126,5.0476190476190474
5559582,4,B00B65QKFW,Good documentary the pictures are amazing unbelievable shots taken The story is a beautiful one. A reminder of our impact on our entire planet let's slow down the warming let's be more conscious of our planet.,1398124800,,209,4.833333333333333
5559583,1,B00B65QKFW,"The trailer makes this movie seem like a story about a polar bear family.  Only a portion included the focus on a bear family.  The majority was a documentary on global warming.  The narrative was too advanced for young kids to understand while the conclusions were too unfounded for young kids (and adults) not to question. The repeated drum beat of ""the ice is melting"" took away from the value of what could be an entertaining family story.  The anecdotal examples used and lack of true evidence cited make the narrative difficult to even listen to regardless of one's stance on environmental change.  Unfortunately, the beautiful imagery was tainted by the in-your-face agenda being force fed while you attempt to learn more about and be entertained by polar bears.",1390003200,6,769,4.930232558139535
5559584,1,B00B65QKFW,"BEWARE!! This is a politically motivated ""Global Warming"" propaganda film. I gave it 1 star only for some of the photography. The repeated global warming messages throughout the (short) film get very annoying. People need to do some of their own research on the ""Global Warming"" issue. A quote from the former Soviet Union President, Mikhail Gorbachev, sums it up pretty well: "" ""The threat of environmental crisis will be the international disaster key to unlock the New World Order."" Similar or related types of statements have been made by President Jacques Chirac of France, the former Canadian Minister of the Environment, Deputy Assistant of State Richard Benedick at the Rio Climate Summit, and Former U.S. Senator Timothy Wirth (D-CO), representing the Clinton Administration as U.S Undersecretary of State for Global Issues, also at the Rio Climate Summit. Look at the climate history of Greenland as an example of NATURAL climate change. It is now completely ice covered. But 600 hundred years ago, it was inhabited by Norse shepherds and their flocks grassing in green fields. Last year, the ice build up in Antarctica set a new record since satellites began recording it. New scientific evidence points to a cooling trend world wide. The ""Global Warming"" issue isn't based on sound scientific evidence! It is based on political control efforts by Socialist governments around the world, and being led by the U.S. and the U.N.",1380412800,7,1437,5.1191489361702125
5559585,5,B00B65QKFW,"This is a beautifully shot film in full blu-ray 3-D, although some parts seem 2-D because white on white doesn't make for a strong enough contrast --just as would be the case if we were actually there. However, the shots of the bears, the caribou, the walruses and the men, dogs and sled are clearly 3-D. The cinematography never fails to amaze. Best just to quiet the mind and open oneself to the overpowering beauty and awesomeness of the scenery. This is a place I'll probably never go, but the 3-D took me there. As some ad says, ""You're either watching a film, or you're part of it."" I felt part of this.

Sure, the film strongly addresses the deterioration of the ice caps and glaciers. Doesn't matter what you think is causing this slow-moving catastrophe. Any sane person will agree we should do whatever we can to slow it down. There's a good chance our children's children (if they haven't left the planet) will be struggling to survive if we are inattentive to this people-destroying event. The polar bears and birds are only among the first to show the effects.

What can a person say? Either we understand that we are helping to slowly choke off Mother Earth's ability to nurture us, or we'd rather be either a politician trying to hold on to power or one of his/her devotees. Nearly all the world's most prominent and well-respected scientists (about 98% at last international count) call this a no-brainer. There is nothing political ultimately about being choked into extinction. Death is death both to Democrats and Republicans.

Meanwhile, Meryl Streep's narration is outstanding, and the Beatles' songs used (of which another reviewer said, ""Ick""!!!!) are wonderful to hear in clear 5.1 sound. Even if you hate thinking about ""climate change"", I would buy this,turn off the sound, put on your favorite music, and become immersed in the amazing visual experience this film affords--particularly in 3-D.",1378512000,3,1920,4.883435582822086
5559586,5,B00B65QKFW,"To the Arctic was magnificently filmed--the scenes are gorgeous and heartwarming.

It tells the story of the joy and plight of polar bears by following one special mother and her two cubs, and yes, it tells of the hardships arctic life and all life will experience if the ice cap continues to melt at the current rate.

The call to action to help preserve the things we cherish was a bonus--not a detraction.

A super movie to watch with children.",1378080000,,447,4.5625
5559587,5,B00B65QKFW,My three year old loves watching it... Meryl Streep is amazing with the narration and it's a dramatic documentary about what we are doing of this world. A must have in your library... Educational and fun..,1371340800,,205,4.722222222222222
5559588,1,B00B65QKFW,"First, this movie is really short. Should I pay full feature length movie prices for it? I don't think so.

Secondly, there are actually two movies going on here - both of which are half baked. The first is a movie following 5 days of a polar bear mother and her cubs running from a cannibalistic male polar bear. It's interspersed with random vignettes of other animals such as sea lions and walruses, but you don't learn much about any of them. They should remove the forced plot and narration from this movie and treat it like one of those rolling nature videos of just imagery and pretty music. Adds about the same value.

The second movie is a political statement regarding global warming unnaturally forced down the viewers throat by narrator Meryl Streep. Look - I don't want to destroy the planet and I think we need serious conversation about solutions - but this film doesn't add value to the debate. At best it's a mother-in-law like guilt trip hanging over your head while looking at cute bears. I compare it to a decent Sunday dinner at the inlaws where you recount your recent trip to Alaska only to have your mother-in-law sporadically interject with comments like ""those polar bears will be dead soon because of that car you drive"" or ""well, I hope you know how to swim because the polar caps are going to be melted by Monday.""

Do yourself the favor - save the money and just call your mother-in-law instead. If I could rate this a zero I would.",1371340800,7,1462,4.53030303030303
5559589,2,B00B65QKFW,it lacks what a 3D movie has. It seems to be a 2D only. I was expecting a movies that would take you to the 3rd dimension but unfortunately I feel like something is missing.,1370217600,,173,3.9714285714285715
5559590,1,B00B65QKFW,"a truly awful movie with icky music by paul mcartney, propagandistic narration by streep, and basically no useful information.  absolutely hated this stupid movie.  but then I don't believe the lies they're pushing, so maybe i'm a tad biased.  should have known better than to rent it.",1369958400,2,285,5.0212765957446805
5559591,4,B00B65QKFW,"Note: I saw this in the theater on the big IMAX screen, so I didn't get the chance to see the extras on the DVD.

This is a wonderful movie with a message, but I'll warn anyone coming into this: this film is very focused on global warming. It's an important message, but I felt that at times this film didn't entirely know what to focus on: the polar bears or the threat to their environment. As a result we don't really have a good look at either. To the Artic is only 40 minutes in length, so this leaves it with a bit of a handicap.

The movie is gorgeous to watch, so even with the film feeling a bit muddled in its focus you still have tons of gorgeous scenery to watch. The film work is really amazing here, with tons of close ups of adorable polar bear behavior and breathtaking shots of the glistening ice. There are also some shots of how the scenes are shot, both human and remote cameras. I think this was one of the more interesting aspects of the movie because at times it shows how dangerous it can be for the equipment and the persons going underwater.

I think that this was toned down a lot for younger audiences and the short length, but at times I kind of feel that they could have done more with this. I remember watching far more intense films when I was younger on PBS and not getting too scared, so I really wish that they'd gone a bit more in depth either way. I do like that this film mentioned how we impact the environment, but I wish that they'd elaborated just a little. Maybe giving some suggestions on how to help or something along those lines?

Overall though this is still very much worth the price of admission to your local theater and worth renting. This does have value as far as viewing it again, as there's nothing truly gory or scary for your younger viewers. They'll love watching the adorable polar bear babies and even if it's a little light, you'll like that it's educational.

For the older viewers, this will be something they'll really only watch a few times so you'd probably be better off getting one of the more full length documentaries on the Artic. This is nice, but a little light for the ones wanting a bit more meat to their viewing experience.",1369526400,9,2201,4.319612590799031
5559592,3,B00B65QKFW,"I always have a big expectations on every IMAX production for the astonishment 3d quality but this time it wasn't similar at all, from other movies. It contain some nice 3D moments but don't worth the price of the Blu-ray.",1368489600,,222,4.575
5559593,5,B00B65QKFW,"To watch such a movie in 2D is a Gr8 experience.

5559595,3,B00B65QKFW,"Despite the price, the facts are more like theories here. The only reason to see this is for the beautiful scenery and maybe Meryl Streep's lovely narration.

5559596,3,B00B65QKFW,"Breathtaking footage:  5 Stars.
Global Warming Lecture:  1 Star (same old same old).

While I am fascinated by Polar Bears, I wish this film had provided a more  in-depth study of other animals of the arctic.  The caribou receives a cursory discussion and a little bit of footage;  the walrus receives the same perfunctory treatment.  No mention is made of arctic wolves, muskox, narwhals, the arctic fox or the dizzying array and abundance of birds.  That is a shame.  I was hoping for more from an IMAX film.  I am disappointed in the shallow coverage of every aspect of this film.  Watch it for the sheer majesty of the wildlife footage and scenery, but don't expect to learn anything new.  If you want to read a much more in-depth,  riveting account of the arctic, I would recommend Arctic Dreams, by Barry Lopez.",1367107200,,817,4.669014084507042

5559600,2,B00B65QKFW,"I had missed the opportunity to see this movie & was looking forward to viewing it on my 3D TV. Some of the photography was beautiful, but the narration/""story"" left a lot to be desired. I enjoy nature documentaries that showcase the animals, offering little known facts and interesting views of their behavior. The film states ""Polar bears are brown bears that moved up to the Arctic & became white"". How about telling the viewers that a polar bear's hair is transparent? That's a real fact!
Unfortunately, this film is politically motivated propaganda focused on ""global warming"", not on polar bears.
