2445763,2,B000BYA5HI,"I read about this movie in Super Street magazine years ago.  I bought it based on the premise it was Romeo & Juilet meets The Fast and the Furious.  But the movie had little racing scenes and a crappy story line.  Don't even buy it previously viewed, wait till its on tv or a dumb friend bought it.  SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!!!!",1201046400,,321,4.213114754098361
2445764,3,B000BYA5HI,"This is an amazing piece of filmmaking.  From the opening credits to the final gruesome scene, it is simply overflowing with incredible camera work and captivating music.  If this film had been made as just an artistic portrayal of street racing in California, and left the story out of it, it might have been closer to a perfect film.  But unfortunately it has a kind of lame story with occasional bad lines delivered by non-actors that do remarkably well, all things considered.  The script and story are still better than that piece of garbage call the Fast and Furious franchise.  So many of the visuals in this movie are absolutely breathtaking, and often times the combination of the visuals and the music have an almost narcotic effect on the viewer.  I felt that the achievements of this film far outweigh the shortcomings, and I do expect to see this director making a major hollywood film in the near future.  If you give him some top-notch screenwriters to work with, he will be one of the great ones.",1157846400,,1012,4.68361581920904
2445765,5,B000BYA5HI,"I really enjoyed this movies for what it was. It was low budget, no stunts, beautiful cinamatography, and decent story. They worked with what they had and made a exelent movie. Defenitly recommeding this movie!!!",1139788800,2,212,5.085714285714285
2445766,1,B000BYA5HI,"As an avid movie watcher and having experienced a small amount of what the culture presented in the movie has to offer, I would honestly have to say that ""Street of a Legend"" had little to offer to anything of action, suspense, drama, or generally anything worth the time to sit and watch it.  It sleepily tells the wayward tale of a racer who gets caught up in something has to do nothing with racing.  From a sock-wiped scene that literally blew to borderline slap-fighting to watching people do everything from put on makeup and piss, the movie basically deglorifies anything that the street scene might have ever had to offer only diminishing the baseline level of the Fast and Furious' futile attempt at giving moviegoers any kind of quality entertainment to watch.  Though the film may have some independent film critic appeal in its euro-asian styling of scene changes, randomness, and un-fairytale-like ending, it generally lacked anything which it might promise to be to viewers looking for entertainment.  Rent it, if you have absoloutey nothing to do and wish to become disenchanted with the street scene and want to watch someone piss, but be forwarned.  JL",1139702400,,1169,4.913705583756345
2445767,1,B000BYA5HI,"Trying to capitalize on the street racing scene and the success of the Fast and the furious franchise and need for speed series. This film is too little too late. I'll give it up to decent camera work but bad acting, bad line delivery, and the same ole' romeo juliet story ruined it. It felt like a self important student film trying to be edgy. Save yourself the cash folks.",1138752000,3,375,4.371428571428571
2445768,2,B000BYA5HI,"I don't know whether it would be more interesting to talk about how this movie was made than the actual movie itself, so I'll talk about BOTH.

Shot almost entirely at night with mini-cams suction-cupped to the sides of high-performance cars, the nocturnal lifestyle of highway streetracing gets its most accurate portrayal ever! This is one of the few racing movies you'll ever see that shows a speedometer cracking 140 mph and the car is actually going that fast (with a teenage driver no less).

No stunt people were used to create the numerous races, fights, and eventual car wreck that occurs. Amazingly, no one was hurt during the filming though some of the drivers were ticketed by the California Highway Patrol, and you get to see the 'CHIPS' captured on camera, too (more illegal surveillance for the audience to enjoy).

Worth watching just for the bright, colorful, visual imagery produced by experimental cinematograpy utilizing modified camera shutter speeds as well as the bravery of the filmmakers themselves for sticking with this project for three years, amassing over 250 hours of footage which is distilled down to about an hour and a half.

In case you're wondering, the title of the film refers to the names of the main male and female characters. 'Quattro' is the nickname of a caucasion racer who's dad used to race professionally (both have awesome cars). 'Noza' is a Mexican hottie who's boyfriend 'Chato' is in jail (as usual), so she ends up falling in love with Quattro, naturally. Later the boyfriend gets out of jail and the inevitable chase and fight scenes occur as predictably as you would expect. The plot and acting in this film are obviously not the most important parts and thankfully they only act as a loose connection to the streetracing scenes galore.

Fans of Hollywood prodcut like the recent ""2 Fast 2 Furious"" will automatically mentally compare the heavy special effects excitement vs. REAL adrenalin since the best parts of this film are the incredibly dangerous nightracing scenes that had to be conducted outside police surveillance, which often meant driving with the headlights OFF down the highway at over 140 mph...even paid stuntmen won't try that too often (if at all).

Worth a rental if streetracing is of interest to you. Like I said before, the way they made the film is crazier sounding than the finished product, but it's still watchable.",1137801600,3,2399,4.94044665012407

8094067,5,B000BYA5HI,"This is one of my favorite racing movies ever! The cinematography is brilliantly done. The story line and the way Streets of Legend is shot makes it seem realistic it is captivating and draws you in. The characters are so well written that you empathize with all of them. Even the ""bad guys"" have aspects about them that are relatable. The racing scenes are amazingly filmed. A must have, gear head or not this movie is quite the ride. It's no wonder it won at the Sundance Film Festival!",1411084800,,488,4.49438202247191

8094070,5,B000BYA5HI,"the story of this movie was sort fo cool, in a different way. maybe I got tired of the same kind of movies with the same kind of story, this is a little different and that surprised me. it involves tuned cars which I find cool, but u can seen it as a clash of cultures and ways of living and actually it had me wondering for its running time what was going to happen and actually I got to care for the characters. I like to see this as a portrait of good intentions on a  bad scenario and how it develops, it definitely got me interested. a B movie that does it job well, I even found it more interesting than a lot of A movies.",1320364800,,628,3.90625
8094071,1,B000BYA5HI,This movies sucked. It was a low budget film thats about a kid with an Audi who races a bunch of civics.,1300147200,,104,3.772727272727273
8094072,4,B000BYA5HI,"Yes the movie is low budget Buuuuuut it was/is the most realistic movie on modern import street racing made...  I saw the release at the Latino film festival in LOS and it was the 2nd most sold out show of the tour.  The love story is a little played out but it was well adapted...I liked the intensity of the main actor..and overall every street racer/car enthusiast I know liked the movie..  I don't think the producers were trying to capitalize on the whole fast and bad acting fliks because those movies got everything all wrong.  Plus the cars were fake up until the last F&F where there were no Japanese actors in a movie thats supposed to take place in Japan...

Check out this movie...you will think its cool overall...!",1265068800,,728,4.526717557251908
8094073,4,B000BYA5HI,The first time I saw this was on HBO! :]  haha I bought this movie to support my friends that are in it... Camera work was great.  The ending was... bleh.  It would also be better if the lead actress was hot. =X  Either than that... I think the movie was pretty good. It kept me entertained for almost 2 hours.,1263513600,,310,4.032786885245901
8094074,1,B000BYA5HI,Just letting you know DVD is not in Widescreen format. Even the front cover has a label reads WIDESCREEN. Very Disappointing.,1259712000,,125,5.0
8094075,1,B000BYA5HI,"I bought the movie because my car was in one of the racing scenes. It took me a long time to find this movie because when they shot it they said it was titled, ""Quatro Nova."" I finally looked up Greg Leone because I knew his car was in it. I think the ""Behind the Scenes"" on Youtube is way better than the movie (mostly cause my wife is in it, she acts like she doesn't know how to start a race). The acting is so bad that it's painful to watch. I skimmed through the movie with my finger on FF just to get a glimpse of my car. I don't see how anyone could really enjoy this unless they were a part of the film making process. I give the director respect for an idea and having balls. My brother is a director and I know making a film sucks the life out of you. Other than that, I don't think there is much I can say for the movie. It looked like a bunch of friends with cameras and a script trying to make a film. It would've been a little more bearable if the lead actress was hot.",1247702400,,983,3.871287128712871
