7344708,4,B012AN26VU,"Much of the attraction to me is that the story was based on a real incident that took place between North and South Korea. Although to call it a battle as the movie did is I think going to far.

The story itself was interesting. I did like the way as the story progressed it was clearly explained what was happening both the diplomatic and military issues.

The acting was good. The characters interesting. I  thought the people who played the relatives of the dead sailors played very well. I really felt for them.

I would recommend it.",1447372800,3,538,4.459183673469388
7344709,5,B012AN26VU,"This is a ""not to be missed"" film. The portrayal of the crew of a small, costal warship off the coast of Korea brought very brilliantly the real life crisis continuing (probably on a regular basis) in Korea. The human interactions of the crew and professional background of the Korean Military were most favorable and one could have been watching characters from any Nation. I thought the film was brilliant, despite the very graphic battle scenes.",1446768000,10,448,4.907894736842105
7344710,3,B012AN26VU,"Technically, North and South Korea have been at war since 1950, with an armistice signed by both sides in 1953 a cease-fire agreement rather than a treaty to end the war. Since then there have been confrontations and flare-ups, and this 2015 South Korean film (with English subtitles) dramatizes the Second Battle of Yeonpyeong. The first (in 1999) involved more boats and loss of life, but the second (2002) features a memorable backdrop, since the North Korean provocation came during the World Cup final rounds as all of South Korea was watching with pride as the first FIFA World Cup was held in Asia, with games taking place in Japan and South Korea. The South Korean team lost close contests to Germany in the semi-finals and Turkey in the consolation match, but there was even more drama happening in the Yellow Sea.

The Northern Limit Line is an imaginary line of demarcation sanctioned by South Korea but questioned by the North. Patrol boats have often had tense near confrontations, but on June 29, 2002 two North Korean patrol boats defiantly crossed the line and attacked one of the South Korean boats that had been monitoring them. This film pays tribute to the six South Korean sailors who were killed in the action.

Structurally, Northern Limit Line is a combination of formula war picture and docudrama. As one reviewer noted, its a tonal cousin to the old patriotic WWII movies and sometimes feels more contrived than realistic because of that formula. Then too, there are some hokey lines, and for that its tough to decide whos to blame:  the writers or the actors. Maybe its a tie. Non-Asians watching this will note that the film was made with the cooperation of the South Korean navy, and watching the men interact aboard their boat will be interesting enough to cut the film a little slack. But attempts to make us care about the characters individually seem just that, with on-leave and flashback side plots feeling a little by-the-numbers and, as a result, almost irrelevant to the main action and relationships aboard the 357.

Northern Limit Line isn't rated but in the U.S. it would merit an R for war violence and language. The F-word is fired as frequently as rounds of ammunition. Ultimately, it would be a 6 out of 10 on most peoples scalesengaging enough, but flawed.",1445731200,,2302,4.805555555555555
7344711,3,B012AN26VU,"Northern Limit Line is a war-at-sea adventure based on a real-life battle that occurred in 2002 in the Yellow Sea, when a North Korean patrol boat crossed the maritime demarcation line and engaged its South Korean counterpart while that nation was involved with a World Cup match with Turkey. This film was a box office hit in South Korea, where it outgrossed bigger-budget Hollywood action pictures.

The confrontation between warships takes only a small percentage of the films 130-minute running time. More than half the screen time is devoted to introducing some South Korean sailors. We have a rookie medic being hazed by his fellow shipmates, the ships humorless commander, and his more congenial helmsman with hand tremors that nearly cause a collision. The backstories are interesting up to a point, but carry on long after we get the sense of who these people are and tend to bog the movie down.

The naval battle is intense, with many close-up views of the horror of war. Choppily filmed and edited, these scenes take on the appearance of documentary footage. One shot shows a dazed combatant scurrying to pick up his blown-off fingers. Much like the Omaha beach landing scene that opens Saving Private Ryan, the naval battle goes for the visceral, with lots of blood and a sense of controlled panic under fire. The final moments of the film include archival footage of the sailors funerals and interviews with survivors. The movie, in Korean with English subtitles, underscores the tensions that still exist 65 years after the beginning of the Korean War.

There are no bonus features on the Blu-ray release.",1445040000,3,1619,4.966789667896679
7344712,5,B012AN26VU,"This 2015 film  an immediate box office hit when it opened in Korea -- portrays the attack on South Korean patrol boats by North Korean naval vessels on August 29, 2002, while South Koreans were watching their national team play World Cup football. The films Korean title is Yeonpyeong Haecheon, the sea battle of Yeonpyeong, but its title in overseas release is Northern Limit Line, referring to the maritime boundary, extending west from the DMZ, between North Korean and South Korean waters in the Yellow Sea.

The protagonists in the film are the 27-man crew of the South Korean Chamsuri-class Patrol Boat 357 which met the attack. Six of the crew died, 18 more were wounded or injured, and the ship sank before it could be towed to base. The film sequences of patrol boats at sea, training, crew coordination, weapons, and the engagement are fast-paced and revealing. A subplot involving the captain, the helmsman, and the boat's medic provides a short meditation on teamwork and duty. A look at the ROK Navys mobile support base and patrols to protect their fishing fleet show how Korea continues to confront an enemy.

To my mind, director Kim Hak-soon and writer Choi Soon-jo drew on many of the same patriotic moods and plot devices American viewers know from films made during World War II. The New York Times slighted the film because it only lightly touched on many themes that might have been explored more deeply  captain and crew, headquarters caution vs. reality afloat, Navy father and Navy son, and family stress among them. My take is that the NYT reviewer missed the films true focus on the cohesion of the crew. Though men are still drafted in South Korea, career military service is not highly paid or esteemed. The film gives it dignity and honor, and it shows how a vibrant, creative, commercial, and democratic society still understands the demands of naval discipline and sacrifice.

Every society handles death in its own way, and theres no universal template for how a people express grief. The final battle scenes  the wounding and death of sailors on Patrol Boat 357  and the long sequence on their funerals (using emotional music and television footage from 2002) open a window on the way Koreans  are.

Tips for viewers: Dont let the shortcomings of the films English subtitles  somehow seamen are called privates  distract you. And don't eject the DVD as soon as the credits begin to roll. They will run alongside some interviews with crew members who survived.

7344726,5,B012AN26VU,"This movie is one of the Best Foreign Films I've ever seen.  Even though having to use English subtitles the acting, and the action kept me on the edge of my seat. This is a realistic reenactment of an actual event triggered by the North Korean Navies intrusion into South Koreans territorial waters.  While being warned away by South Korean Patrol Craft the North Korean vessel fired on, and crippled one of the two South Korean Patrol Craft.  This movie has factual based content with all to realistic action seens.  Cast acting is stellar.  Deserves a serious viewing,  or two, or, three.

7344742,4,B012AN26VU,I'm a self confessed flaming liberal but at the same time I love modern military movies like Black Hawk Down and Lone Survivor. Northern Limit Line isn't as good as those two but it's still worth your time if you a fan of the genre. It takes  a while to get going but when the bullets and shells start flying at the end it's worth the wait. It's also pretty refreshing to see a modern war film in a maritime setting.,1447545600,3,416,4.135802469135802
