7034925,5,B00UB7Z6MO,"If you haven't seen Spirited Away, it's a bit weird. A girl gets trapped in the spirit world and her parents are turned into pigs, so she has to go on a number of adventures to save herself and her parents. It's a ""coming of age"" story told in the fantastic way that only Studio Ghibli could manage, and it's a fantastic introduction to anime if you're new to the style. It's a bit dark at some points and may scare smaller children, so be aware that this is probably better suited to kids who can handle a bit more mature themes. The Blu-ray is great, though there's not a lot of special features or anything.",1518739200,,610,4.267241379310345

7034945,2,B00UB7Z6MO,"AMAZING film!!!! EVERYONE SHOULD SEE IT! The animation is mind-blowing, the story is astounding, the execution was beyond perfect, and the art was phenomenal!!! But I'm not reviewing the content of the film here on Amazon; unfortunately, I am just reviewing the quality of the product sent to me. Here we go....

The set comes with a blu-ray and dvd disc. That's great, right? No matter what player you have on hand, you can see this masterpiece for yourself! Well I have a blu-ray player and was planning on seeing it in blu-ray quality. I pop in the blu-ray, it prompts for language selection, I select a language, and the screen cuts to a load screen of a 3 jumping heads animation..... and continues for.... 10 minutes.... then 15.... I let this thing go on for a full 20 minutes holding out hope! Yeah, I don't think anyone can blame me for not waiting long enough or not trying hard enough
to get this thing to work. GARBAGE!!! I was sold a ""lemon"" blu-ray disc and I want to warn everyone out there thinking about buying this particular package to be aware of my experience.

I did, however get to see the dvd version as my blu-ray player plays multiple disc formats. The resolution was all out-of-whack, and the extremely dated previews threw me off, but otherwise, it all worked out. I have no issue with the film, but the seller willingly delivered a product that simply doesn't work. On Amazon, the dvd alone seems to be only like a few dollars cheaper and available for pre-order now, but the principle of getting a blu-ray that doesn't play the film is what grinds my gears.

I guess I should count my blessings and thank the seller for not selling me a set which has both a busted dvd and blu-ray disc, but I payed for both to arrive and be in working condition. So, seller, here's an extra star for at least giving me the gift of being able to see this Ghibli masterpiece **clicks 2-star as opposed to 1-star rating**, but seriously disappointing results in regard to the blu-ray. Any potential buyers reading, YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!",1504224000,,2047,4.557065217391305

My 9-year-olds loved it and the whole family had fun watching it and introducing the children to Studio Ghibli. Good family entertainment that was not rude, vulgar, sexual, or any other sort of content that made it challenging to watch with children. My kids love Studio Ghibli films.

7034996,1,B00UB7Z6MO,"Not suitable for young children; parts of it will terrify them and make them fear that their parents, interested only in shoveling food into their own mouths, will not protect their own children.

Not suitable for older children and adults.  Too smarmy, and slow-developing.

The voice actors seem to have accepted their roles only to pick up a paycheck; they deliver their lines flatly, with no real involvement or emotion.

Overall:  a terrible movie.",1494720000,,453,5.0675675675675675

Its a great movie to show someone who is interested in anime but isn't sure. The dubbing is done pretty well, and the original Japanese with subbing is excellent.  for younger kids, I would definitely advise an adult sit with them and watch it, as some parts would definitely frighten them.

This particular DVD comes with the English, French and original Japanese voiceover. It does not include English subtitles per se. If you watch in Japanese and turn on the English Closed Captions, the dialog in the text would be the same dialog of the English. Therefore, it isn't a translation of the Japanese dialog. If you're someone who likes to watch the movies in their original language, just know that you won't be getting a true translation in the subs.",1489881600,3,539,4.673684210526316
7035018,5,B00UB7Z6MO,"Chihiro (Daveigh Chase) is an apathetic, 10 year-old girl being forced to move to a new town with her parents. During the car ride to their new home, her father gets lost and they come across what looks to be an abandoned town. Chihiro is skeptical of the place, but her parents take advantage of some free food available at a restaurant, despite no one being around. Then things start to get weird. She is warned by a boy named Haku (Jason Marsden) to leave immediately, but her route back has turned into a river. She finds that her parents have turned into pigs and various types of spirits are now populating this mysterious town. It seems that she is now in a spirit world and must figure out how to get home.

Spirited Away is probably the most well-known film to come from Studio Ghibli and the legendary anime director Hayao Miyazaki. It really stands out as an exemplary example of animated films.

To start off with, the animation in this film is outstanding. There is a ton of detail in the background art that really helps to bring alive both the real world and the fantasy world that Chihiro spends most of the film in. The designs and animation of the characters themselves is well done and really helps make this film a memorable experience. This is especially notable with Chihiro herself who goes through many emotions and experiences throughout the film from her humorous reaction to meeting a stink spirit to a sad realization over her situation. The other characters are very memorable in their own right as well. Taking place in a fantasy setting really gave the creators of this film a lot of chances to come up with imaginative characters, such as the various spirits seen, and they used this opportunity well. This includes the witch-like Yubaba (Suzanne Pleshette) who runs the bathhouse along with the mysterious spirit No-Face (Bob Bergen) that follows Chihiro around.

All other aspects of this film work as well. As I have already mentioned, the characters and story are well written and really help make this movie memorable. The music is top notch, composed by Ghibli regular Joe Hisaishi. In addition to this, I thought that Disney did a good job with their dub that stays faithful to the original story, for those that prefer dubs.

Not much else to say about this as most people who get this film universally acclaim it but because nothing is perfect I think it's worth mentioning that despite the incredible colors and imagery, the actual animation is only a few steps up from choppy anime.

7035106,5,B00UB7Z6MO,"My absolute favorite movie from Studio Ghibli, with Kiki's Delivery Service being a near tie. The characters are wonderfully done, thought out and easily loved. Even the villains have their moments, where not all is bad and things are not exactly cut and dry, black and white.
While the movie can be a bit dark, the fantasy and story drives you to explore the bizarre world Chihiro finds herself in, to save her parents. Everything is magical here, the spirits work and play, similar as in the human world. The setting of the story mainly stays within the bathhouse, as the only human, Chihiro attempts to fit in long enough to help those she learns to care for, including Haku. (My favorite character beyond Chihiro)
Despite the story being encompassing, the darker moments of strife and bizarre actions of some of the Spirits may not be suitable for younger children. They could become frightened or have disturbing dreams. That said, it is an excellent movie for adults and anime lovers. The voice acting is wonderful.",1475020800,,1021,4.84

7035133,5,B00UB7Z6MO,"Every Man woman and child should see this movie at least once.  If you love Disney classics this is HEADS and TAILS above. Don' be fooled by the ""anime"" style of animation. This is beyond any other anime, cartoon, and most academy nominated movies. I, as an adult seeing it for the first time, was literally in tears by the end because it took me on such a deep, vast journey. I was ""spirited away"". Some people may be turned off by the magical connotations but the magic is simply an element in the storytelling. It is truly about friendship, work ethic, GRATITUDE, love and personal development. SO many statements/ themes that I believe people in the west ESPECIALLY need to see explored. If more movies were made like this, people would appreciate the movies again. I VERY RARELY take the time out to right a good review but this is the type of entertainment that made me want to be in the entertainment industry in the first place so I must give props. Every child who grows up in the comforts of capitalism should also see this. You won't find the level of values or morals on Nickelodean, ABC, or Disney that you find here. This movie has no other agenda to sell you toys and games. IT is truly a masterpiece.",1470528000,4,1216,4.452914798206278

7035136,5,B00UB7Z6MO,"No point in reviewing the movie.  They made an Oscar category to give this film an Oscar, essentially.  It's amazing, possibly one of the best animated films ever made, while still being very functional and down to earth.  I can go on and on, it's a great movie.

Let's talk instead about this release.  I saw this film in the theater twice, that was the best way to see it.  I have owned it on DVD since that came out, and I always found that lacking a little.  The Blu ray goes a long way to close the gap.  The issues I had with the transfer, the pixelization, the slight wash of the color and more.. gone.  It looks amazing, I suppose if you have a great A/V setup you will really love this new release, I have an OK one, and this took me back to how I felt in the theater.

All I can really say is ""About time!"".

If you have the DVD, this is a significant upgrade.

7035156,5,B00UB7Z6MO,"This movie is a unique trip into a fantasy world filled with mind bending surprises. It will throw your sences off and peel back any closed doors of your imagination. It exposes a world unknown.

A young girl is moving to a new location and will be going to a new school. Her family is in route to their new home when they encounter a ""bump"" in the road. This bump is some abandoned structure that is blocked by a small Buddha like statue that impedes their car to enter. The family decides to walk into this abandoned area, leaving their car behind. This is when things start to go wild in the film.

Before you know it, her parents turn into gluttonous pigs before your eyes! This is where the protagonist becomes someone who you didn't know before becomes a person that you care about.

It is an adventure....to say the least. This story is loaded with surprise and unique characteristics. It is bold, creative, and original. It reminds me of ""Alice In Wonderland"" but different. Spirited Away may impact the emotions more than Alice and Wonderland. That is how I feel about it, but everyone is different. Everyone IS different in ""Spirited Away""!
It is a fantacy movie. It slaps you broadside with images only one could even dream about. You may find yourself asking ""what did I just watch?"" in a good way. It is a mind trip.

It is a great movie. The plot delivers an outcome that shouldn't disappoint anyone who enjoys a good fairy tail. It is worth the watch!",1465257600,,1466,4.5

I especially love the character No Face. It is SO cute with its little ""ah, ah, ah"" noises. I bought a little stand-up plush of it so I can look at the cutie everyday on my shelf.

Anyways, the main character in this movie is very relatable to my own childhood because she starts off as a fearful and frightened child of the world and throughout the movie she has to muster up the courage to overcome those fears.

The art work was fine (even though it was just average I found it to be a nice change from Western art), but there was virtually no plot, story line, or meaning. All these weird creatures and things you come across in the movie thinking that they would have some great deep meaning at the end had absolutely none except one, and even that one did not give any insight into the meaning of the whole adventure. On top of that it was quite boring. The boredom I was more than happy to overlook while watching the movie since I thought it would pay off at the end, but no, no great pay off at the end, just straight boredom.

7035244,2,B00UB7Z6MO,"First, I didn't watch this with kids but have seen it advertised to kids before. I would never watch this with young children, maybe not even sensitive teenagers. Ok, now onto the review.

I actually thought I was watching the wrong thing given the beaming reviews for this movie. To be fair, I typically find that I don't enjoy anime produced before 2007/8, I'm not sure what it is but that seems to be the turning point for me. I probably wouldn't have given this a chance if amazon's 2015 date hadn't tricked me, the 2001 production date would have tipped me off.

The art holds up with anything produced today which is very impressive. The voice acting is good (Japanese), the main character likeable and the soundtrack is mostly good. However, I just don't get why people love it so much. The pacing was all over the place, it wrapped up way too quickly and the darkness of the movie seemed almost accidental in the end. It was like it was directed by Tim Burton but he forgot what he was up to three quarters of the way through. Add to that the issue of Haku looking like he was copy-pasted out of some much older and worse anime and I'm just left confused.

The story got very dark at points and far too spiritually reckless for my taste but it also failed at generally being a story in the end. I almost laughed when that grandpa-spider guy started talking about ""love"" between the characters. It made no sense! So many characters had no progression at all and then suddenly pulled a 180 out of nowhere and for no reason. The entire climax of the story was like some kind of ""writers-block-ex-machina"" or something.

Despite some beautiful scenes and the technical impressiveness of this 2001 title, I considered it a waste of time. Eclipsed by a small mountain of better and newer content that has unfortunately left me unable to appreciate whatever novelty drove such strong ratings for this film. If anything, I am left sad that the main character was put into such an awful world and drug through such an unnecessary story. Frankly, I would have been more interested in just watching her tackle her new school. The nebulous, quasi-spiritual bumbling attempt at some kind of deep experience just left me frustrated. The story's threads of coherence ran so thin and with such ambiguous meaning that they eventually just faded away. Its a case of a post-modern story treading too close to the edge.

This movie seems to be trapped in its own cage, asking the real question of whether or not it can ever find its way back to meaning something. However, in this case the writers have made sure it will never escape and that it continues to serve as nothing more than an example of technical mastery in animation only.

Its sad; I have been looking forward to this one for a few years now.",1449360000,,2795,4.568862275449102

7035272,5,B00UB7Z6MO,"""Spirited Away is one of the best films ever made,"" said a man (me) who actually doesn't care for anime.

A while back, I borrowed Spirited Away from my local library, and instantly fell in love with it.  This shining example of the animator's craft is a sheer delight, probably as near to perfection as one can get.  Even the fantasy sequences are drawn with a good deal of realism, and everything has an almost natural flow from beginning to end.  Even the simplest of characters have a depth that simply doesn't exist in most movies these days, which makes Chihiro's transformation from brat to hero that much more spectacular.

I'd like to say all I can, but Amazon's servers probably aren't large enough to hold half of it.  Therefore, I shall summarize by saying that if you've never watched Spirited Away, you're seriously missing out.  If I, a man who doesn't like anime, can be moved to give praise for an anime film, it's definitely something special.",1444435200,,961,4.684523809523809

7035289,5,B00UB7Z6MO,"Personally, this is one of my favorites to come out of Studio Ghibli, but be cautious as this isn't just a regular ""tale"". From Wikipedia, here is a small excerpt describing the theme.

""The major themes of Spirited Away center on the protagonist Chihiro and her liminal journey through the realm of spirits, wherein Chihiro becomes separated from everything she has known. Chihiro's experience in the alternate world, which may be compared to Lewis Carroll's Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, represents her passage from childhood to adulthood. The archetypal entrance into another world demarcates Chihiro's status as one somewhere between child and adult. Chihiro also stands outside societal boundaries in the supernatural setting. The use of the word kamikakushi (literally ""hidden by gods"") within the Japanese title, and its associated folklore, reinforces this liminal passage: ""Kamikakushi is a verdict of 'social death' in this world, and coming back to this world from Kamikakushi meant 'social resurrection.'"" Yubaba has many similarities to The Coachman from Pinocchio, in the sense that she transforms humans into pigs in a similar way that the boys of Pleasure Island were transformed into donkeys. Upon gaining employment at the bathhouse, Yubaba's seizure of Chihiro's true name symbolically kills the child, who must then assume adulthood. She then undergoes a rite of passage according to the monomyth format; to recover continuity with her past, Chihiro must create a new identity.""",1442534400,,1502,5.474137931034483

I suggest you do a quick skim of the movie before screening it for children under 8. You know your kids best, and both movies have some scenes which may be a bit much for your little ones. Considering the video games and other movies the kids see, in which even ""family"" films have the F bomb constantly tossed at them, these movies are nicely free of profanity. I don't understand why moviemakers feel they need to degrade the language of films to such a degree. But that's another topic.
If you're looking at this film for purchase you've probably at least heard about the plot, and there are some excellent reviews already posted. So I'll tell you that this a great movie that you'll want to watch more than once. It's fun! Watch for little things in the background, little creatures and the way they act. I read one review that complained that it was dubbed in English, and that nuances of the original Japanese was lost. I don't know about you, but outside of the words used in Japanese cuisine I know very little of their language. I checked, and it seems the translation is pretty well done. I accidentally bought the series Tri-Gun in the original Japanese, and for me the subtitles in English added nothing but distraction to a great series. Tri-Gun is a great series for both kids and adults, by the way.
Spirited Away is, in my opinion, a solid 5 stars. Unique, inventive, we'll drawn with great voices. If you like anime and animation, you'll be happy you bought this. I've never met anyone who hasn't liked this film. So get to popping and enjoy! :)",1441238400,,1728,4.523961661341853

Of course, you aren't here to have me tell you about the movie, if you want that find a great description, but this about the quality itself.
The case it comes in is up to standards and is amazing. There are no scratches or dents or rips, unless you look microscopically and find all the tiny details no one usually can see. When it comes to the plastic holding the movies it is also great quality and doesn't break and feels strong. Both discs are distignuishable easily and are impossible to mix up. The sound quality of course is amazing, but it is hard not to be with the beautiful soundtrack in this film. Even on the Standard version of the movie, it still looks beautiful, but the Blueray is even better. This is an all time favorite film by Studio Ghibli and recommend this product for anyone. Compared to past versions of the film I have seen even in Standard, where it looked as bad as Yubaba and made you as cranky as Kamaji, this is as amazing as Haku and makes you as happy as Chihiro when she gets her parents back.

7035442,5,B00UB7Z6MO,"Absolutely gorgeous film in every way possible. This film is a veritable feast for the senses. It has something for everyone. Even if you are not generally an Anime fan, you owe it to yourself to see Spirited Away. In fact, you would do well to see everything that Studio Ghibli has produced. From the action and intense drama of Princess Mononoke to the slapstick comedy of Lupin the 3rd. Hayao Miyazaki is a true genius. Not only as the finest Anime artist of all time, but as a film maker in general. Miyazaki is the best. Period. I have never seen anything that he produced that wasn't an absolute gem. I was very concerned when Disney acquired the Studio Ghibli library but those fears proved to be completely unnecessary. I will eventually own the entire Miyazaki library on Blu-Ray now that they are all being made available. This story is so perfect, and so unique, that I simply cannot express well enough just what a joy it is to watch. I am thrilled with my purchase.",1434585600,5,978,4.531073446327683
7035443,5,B00UB7Z6MO,"What can I say that hasn't been said before?  Watch it yourself and be enchanted, amazed and dazzled by Miyazaki's mastery of the art form.",1434499200,,139,4.56

7035445,5,B00UB7Z6MO,"What can be said about ""Spirited Away"" that has not been stated before? This is one of the best animated films ever created and arguably the highlight of Hayao Miyazaki's extraordinary career. This incredibly imaginative work is combined with an emotional story that really makes this one special.

This is the story of Chihiro, a 10 year old girl who is moving to a new city when her parents decide to take a quick detour to what seems to be an abandoned amusement park. However, the park is filled with magical creatures and her parents are turned into pigs. Chihiro must grow up quickly in this exotic world not only to save her parents, but to survive.

I cannot speak enough about the story itself which is expertly crafted or the beautiful animation that includes some wonderful scenes at the bath house, the strange characters that fill the screen and my favorite, the train on the flooded tracks which provides views of the distant clouds that almost had me feeling the cool breeze blowing past. This is a must-see film for sure.

As for the blu-ray transfer, all I can say is ""Finally!"" as it took long enough. The blu-ray provides a crisp, clean presentation of the film which meets and exceeds all expectations. I was fortunate enough to see Spirited Away in the theaters which is the only way to view this film in a superior format to the blu-ray edition.

As far as the rest of the extras goes, it duplicates what was available on the standard 2-disc DVD that was released several years ago. However, that does not detract from my rating at all. If you like this movie, then by all means get this blu-ray edition as it is well worth the price.",1434412800,53,1656,4.565656565656566
7035446,5,B00UB7Z6MO,"Pre-ordered this so I could watch this the day it came out (I've been anxiously awaiting this blu ray for more years than I'd like to admit) and refrained from watching it until I could finally bear witness to the excellence that is 1080p. Now we all know and love the movie and this totally delivers. It has everything the dvd had but in such gorgeous quality I'm blown away. This was done very well, my only complaint is it should have come out much sooner! I'm only 5 minutes in but already so excited. I'm a Miyazaki lover through and through which makes these blu rays something special and with every single penny. Font waste your time waiting for this to get cheaper because it never will. Blow the money and thank me later. Now I'm going to finish the movie while you order and thank me later!",1434412800,25,801,4.382550335570469
7035447,5,B00UB7Z6MO,"This film introduced me to Studio Ghibli as a whole. Because of this one film, I went on to purchase 11 more and I am an avid collector.",1434412800,5,136,3.892857142857143
7035448,5,B00UB7Z6MO,"Spirited Away,"" directed by Hayao Miyazaki (Princess Mononoke), is a Japanese animated film about a young girl, Chihiro, who takes an unusual adventure. Chihiro and her parents are moving, but her father takes a wrong turn and wind up in what appears to be an abandoned theme park. Chihiro decides to explore and soon is trapped in an odd palace inhabited by weird-looking creatures. Turns out the palace is the resting place of 80 million spirits and is overseen by tyrannical Yubaba.

Miyazakis animated films are characterized by a lush visual style, fanciful characters, and parallel worlds to out own. Using the basic theme of a stranger in a new and amazing world, the film is a sort of Alice In Wonderland presents one peculiar sight after another. Its almost like going through a museum of animated oddities. Some of the creatures Chihiro encounters are downright creepy, and may be too frightening for very young children. But older kids and adults will be fascinated.

Bonus features on the Blu-ray/DVD Combo Pack include an introduction by John Lasseter, footage of the English-speaking actors dubbing the movie, original Japanese storyboards, Nippon television special, and the featurette The Art of Spirited Away, which explores Hayao Miyazakis creative vision.",1434240000,,1274,5.209756097560976
7035449,5,B00UB7Z6MO,This movie was pointless and boring. The animations reminded me of super Mario brothers from the NES. Music was atrocious that bled my eardrums and the characters were 1 dimensional. This is quite simply a poorly made film.,1433980800,,223,4.894736842105263

7035483,5,B00UB7Z6MO,"It's obviously pointless to try and come up with new accolades for Miyazaki, to me, Spirited Away edges out Howl as his crowing achievement. His movies are the best argument in support of ""animation does not have to equal cartoon"". This is as enjoyable for adults as it is for children, but now that it's under Disney's umbrella...please give us DIGITAL COPIES!! Preferably iTunes but i'll take Ultra Violet (now that Vudu supports HD).

I just don't think many people keep their movies on discs anymore. So please, if anyone is listening, please give us Miyazaki Digital Copies!!

I was really excited to see that they were re-releasing this in BluRay until I saw that it was an English Dubbed version.  No offense to English actors, but they have not been able to capture the spirit and nuances of the characters.  This has totally ruined my excitement.  It doesn't seem as if it will even include the original Japanese.  So this is a No purchase for me on that basis alone.
Edited 5/9/2015 - This does include the original Japanese listed under the dubbed version. However, this is still a no to me as it was created for American audiences with the implication that Americans are only interested in the English language. I will stick with the original DVD version.",1430179200,6,799,4.5524475524475525
