This was ""the greatest air battle in history"" when the outnumbered British RAF successfully fought off the superior German Luftwaffe in 1940 and prevented an invasion of England. Over 100 vintage aircraft were used to recreate this story. It starts in May 1940 France , the French are retreating, the Germans are advancing. British Hurricanes must be flown quickly to safety. Air Marshal Dowding asks that all fighter planes be kept in England for homeland defense. A peace offer is made to the British but this is refused. The film shows the need to train pilots quickly while the Germans attacked channel shipping. The British are trying to produce 100 aircraft per week. The Germans are bringing up boats for the planned invasion after the RAF was destroyed on the ground. [No mention of the British navy?]

German aircraft were designed for short-range tactical warfare. They would have only thirty minutes over England. British radar allowed an early warning and minimized their use of aircraft. The German attacks on the radar towers brought Spitfires in a counterattack. German Heinkels bombed British airfields to eliminate their defenders. The Germans believed they destroyed half of the British fighter planes. One Spitfire would attack a flight of bombers to break up their formation, then the others would pick off individual targets. The British shortage was in pilots, not fighters. The British bombed Berlin, the Germans stopped bombing airfields and switched to bombing London. On September 7, 1940 the largest German air attack began on London. This was a surprise for the British, and fires spread. The film shows the effects. [Imagine 9/11 happening every week!] They gained pilots from the Polish, Czech, and Canadian groups. Sending German planes to bomb London put them at the limits of their range, and allowed the British to concentrate their fighters for maximum effect against the bombers. German fighters were sent to guard the bombers, but they failed to destroy the RAF. The day arrived when all British aircraft were committed, there was no reserves.

After a week the day arrived when there were no more German attacks. The German strategy had changed. ""Never was so much owed by so many to so few."" A few years later the British published books on the Ultra secret. We learned there was more to this story than the radar towers. The British could decipher the German codes and had an ultra-reliable source on their plans. Could this have been used to trick the Germans into bombing London and to spare the airfields? Or to convince the Germans that Britain had been neutralized and was no longer a threat? We know about ""The Man Who Never Was"", but not about the changed German strategy.
The parallel views of German activities show that the war was finally over, and a united Europe was possible in the future. This was not possible in the 1950s. Len Deighton wrote a book Fighter that provides an overall view of this battle. Michael Kordas With Wings Like Eagles also provided a big picture of this important conflict.",1436832000,,3111,4.9559386973180075
