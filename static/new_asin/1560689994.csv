182626,5,1560689994,"I've watched this with my son growing up and gave it to him for a wedding gift so he can watch with his children.
Children's movies should be legitimately scary.  They should make children work.  They should make children think.  And happy endings are like mayo on wonder bread.  Time Bandits is spicy mustard on rye",1506988800,,316,4.589285714285714

182629,5,1560689994,This movie is an interesting blend of subtle comedy and mysticism. If you're not familiar with mystical traditions you may be confused by this movie. If you like your brain tweaked you'll enjoy this one. It is a mystical trip along the hero's journey (a'la Joseph Campbell).,1502928000,2,274,4.851063829787234

182635,5,1560689994,"My favorite Python movie. Sometimes these guys can get silly, in an almost embarrassing way, as they did in Holy Grail and Life of Brian, but this movie has less of that. The humor is not politically correct, but it's well-developed, and there's a good plot line. A gang of dwarfs, who were formerly employed on God's repair crew, steal a map of the universe that shows all the time holes, and they decide to go on a spree as ""international criminals."" They pick up a young English boy on the way, and drop in on Napoleon, Robin Hood, and Agamemnon, among others. Very colorful. Anachronisms were used for comic effect, but the background details mostly felt right for the times and places depicted (though the setting around Mycenae did seem a bit too barren to support an ancient city).",1493078400,,788,4.635714285714286

182678,5,1560689994,"should probably start by saying I was actually looking for this film...I remembered it from the WayBack Machine. This is a marvelous movie, although some of the imagery may be a bit disturbing (oppressive and scary) for the youngsters. I think it is definitely an adult film, but, you know, its Monty Python-like, so its a bit off kilter...its not a PG type, easy to follow or grasp film.
A bit of history, irreverently posed, silly stuff, but also quite a bit about good and evil, with an appropriate to the story cameo by God.
The ""stars"" of the film have been sent back to earth from heaven, to try again...and they have many conversations weighing this and that the way we all do...so there is some value stuff in here also. Yet the film never really takes a side on much of this.
Many wacko shifts from one location/time to another, and just plain fun and silly throughout.
The acting is appropriate to the film...its rather a slap-stick presentation of actually some rather interesting topics/subjects.",1430784000,,1008,4.732954545454546

182681,2,1560689994,"Terry Gilliam is a brilliant art director, but he's not a very good director of actors. Some really good performers manage to shine in his movies anyway, but quite often they do what most everyone does in Time Bandits --  flail around his elaborate sets, shout all their lines, and overact atrociously, as though they're all desperate to get his attention. In Time Bandits all the yelling and mugging and running around gets really tiresome pretty early, and the volume is rarely turned down even a notch through the whole thing. I don't find it very entertaining to be hollered at for two hours, and it certainly drains the film of much of its inherent charm. Maybe I'll try it some time with the sound off and see if I like it better -- the sets, as usual in his movies, are ingenious.",1428624000,,787,4.503496503496503

182689,4,1560689994,"This is simply one of the great, wacky, silly movies.

A young boy gets swept up into a gang of dwarve who have (it happens) stolen The Map of Creation.  With it these dwarves (who feel underappreciated after the Creation was all done) are traveling through time stealing artificats and relics.  They are pursued by the Supreme Being (God) and end up battling with the Ultimate Darkness (the Devil).  Along the way they visit Ancient Greece, the Middle Ages, and the Titanic....it's a grand romp.

The movie doesn't always make a lot of sense (in the way of most Python movies) but it's pretty much always fun.

HIGHLY recommended if you're fans of the Monte Python crowd, silly science fiction/fantasy, or just plain want a good time.",1421884800,3,735,4.748031496062992

All of the performances are great--Sean Connery, Ian Holm, John Cleese, Kenny Baker, David Rappaport, David Warner, and Sir Ralph Richardson.

182769,5,1560689994,"In 1981, you couldn't just use computer animation to realistically create anything you wanted on the silver screen. That's not to say that Time Bandits' visual effects aren't convincing, but you need more than that, then and now - you need a story. Terry Gilliam delivers a highly imaginative one in Time Bandits, along with a gentle message on materialism. It's the kind of quality film-making that holds up over the decades, and that a parent can watch with their kids (I know, because I just did). Who needs CGI alien robots blowing each other up when you have a tattooed giant wearing a ship on his head? If you like Tim Burton's movies, or just fancy watching something refreshingly different but still meaningful, check out Time Bandits.",1391990400,,743,4.8125
182770,4,1560689994,"Terry Gilliam has a real sense of theatrics and atmosphere, and it comes to full life in Time Bandits.  Giving an allegory of the thick entrails of technology alongside an inspired take on the Biblical tale of good and evil, Time Bandits explores the desire to escape through imagination by taking us on the journey of young Kevin as his dreams come to life in his bedroom.  When a band of dwarfs come out of his closet, he is taken on a journey through time as they follow a special map to find treasure through the holes in the fabric of time.  Along the way, they are tracked by Evil, who is determined to get his hands on the map for himself.  They are watched over closely by The Supreme Being, who monitors their every move, all the while Kevins horizons are clearly being broadened.  The way that classic storybook characters and historical moments are incorporated here is rather inspired, and the sets, costumes and overall ensemble are rich and memorable.  It does get a tad clunky in the end, and it really doesnt have the subtle touches that made The Neverending Story so insightful, but as a whole it works really well.  I will note that this was one of many 80s childrens fairy tale movies that thrived on a darker atmosphere and tone and really isn't all that suitable for young children.  All the murder, mayhem, darkness and that conclusion could be too much for them and can illicit nightmares.  Consider yourself warned.",1391472000,,1439,4.6117647058823525

I was twelve years old a compelling story line kept me entranced right up to the ending, which, looking back, was probably my first WTF? experience. You'll have to watch the movie yourself to understand what I mean, but anyone who has seen it knows how strange the was for what was considered a kids movie. At that age, I did not appreciate the political and societal jabs, I was just tagging along with the lead character, Kevin, on a wonderful journey through time. Looking back, and now knowing who the writer, Terry Gilliam, is, I better understand the movie's British sense of humor. The great thing is, it was funny to me in 1981 as a kid (though did have some dark moments) and its still funny to me today.

I watched this as part of Amazon Prime and catch it every now and then on television (though not as much as it should be on.) There's been talk of a sequel for probably thirty years, but I doubt it ever gets made and am not sure it needs to be made.

I was entranced by the imagery (the boat `hat' and the Fortress of Ultimate Darkness), found the plot hilarious, it's been a favorite film of mine ever since.  Upgrading to Blu-ray was automatic; I didn't have to think twice about it.  It looks as fabulous as I remember seeing it in a theater.  A delightful, madcap adventure filled with sly wit and impertinence.  The story is certainly unique.  A merry band of larcenous tree-making maniacs decide to go on a crime spree and drag a poor boy (Craig Warnock as Kevin) along with them.  Their adventures include meeting and robbing a size obsessed Napoleon (Ian Holm) and in turn being robbed by Robin Hood (John Cleese).  Depending on your sense of humor, this is all quite fun.  Otherwise, it might just be a bit mystifying.  One of my favorite scenes involves arm wrestling (with a slight twist).  It stars one of my favorite actors (Ralph Richardson) as the Supreme Being.  ""Yes, well, I am the nice one.""  Also featured is David Warner as Evil.  ""I will turn you inside out for a very long period of time.""

A lot of the material is too grown up or just plain weird to be targeted to kids....unless you were a weird kid like me LOL....The humor is British so not a lot of people will understand it right away...
I love it because its an imaginative,fun take on history and time travel. Its not meant to be an accurate or serious portrayal of history. Its also really odd and really weird which is one of the things I love about it. It was made in a time when there were no real computer effects or blue/green screen technology. The sets and costumes are very inventive and the story is original in its strangeness. There is some great one liners in this movie and I think the way god and evil are portrayed is original. People seem to be unsettled by the ending of this movie which is why I love the end so much....it just ends with poor Kevin finally freed from his parents (his parents were such bastards in this move, they deserved what they got at the end) and it just ends leaving so many things unanswered....I also love the way it zooms out to show how small the earth really is in the whole map of space and time...Love the ending, when and if they remake this, I hope they don't change the super weird ending...",1370822400,,1437,4.2101449275362315

182906,2,1560689994,"What an odd childhood film auteur Terry Gilliam must've had. Or perhaps didn't have?

Obviously not intended as a linear story, got that. But this is just one free-for-all of explosive randomness; tossing varying Python-like skits into a single boiling pot of historical vignettes, only loosely linked to one another by a single, very fragile plot thread.

Was surprised to read how many reviewers gush over this bizarre, but imaginative, Neo-Dadaist vision.

Tells the story of a band of frustrated workers of The Supreme Being, creator of all the universe. Naughtily, they've stolen a cosmic map from the boss which shows the places where creation didn't quite fit, doorways into which one can pass through time. They've decided that it'll be grand fun to go out and do a bit of thieving, bit of drinking and partying, and perhaps locate the grandest prize of all. Unfortunately, or fortunately, for one young boy named Kevin - they've stumbled into his bedroom first.

Thus begins a time traveling adventure with some less-than-scrupulous, mildly incompetent bumpkins, who are hell-bent (literally it turns out) to have a party of epic proportions. Will they succeed? Or will they get caught by the owner of their special map?

Gilliam has the ability to craft wonder, humor and visionary films. The amazing and fantastic '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Brazil/dp/B000G8NXZK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Brazil</a>' comes to mind. But this flick has found a populist home with adolescent and arrested post-adolescents who, like all teenagers and desperate conforming non-conformist adults, take pleasure in seeing cacophony in place of cognizant recognition; finding warm acceptance in the chorus of same voices. Same reason bands like GWAR finds a place at the table of so many like-minded self-ostracizing outcasts.

Finally, I was stunned to read the many positive reviews - not that positives can't be found in the film or that positives are any reflection of the mindset of the viewers. Rather, it was extremely disturbing to read how many did not discuss the film itself - but noted, with all boisterous contempt and indignant haughtiness, that the film transfer was not well done.

What? That's the entirety of your ""review"" - you didn't like the transfer?

182909,4,1560689994,"Time Bandits is one of my all time favorite films.  I was excited to find this on Blu-Ray. Then I saw that it was listed as 1080i on the packaging and was concerned. Why on Earth would a company release a feature film as 1080i on a blu-ray disc? Apparently this is the standard format for films put out on blu-ray by Image Entertainment as they've done this with several other major films they've released. With a business model like that, I doubt they'll last.

The print's color is much better than the old DVD I had, and the image is nowhere near as dark.  HOWEVER, the image seems to have simply been artificially lightened to make it less dark and the result is that the dark areas show blocking, compression noise, and artifacts.

What was MOST disturbing is that no attempt has been made to give us a clean print!  This blu-ray disc shows tons of dust flecks and scratches in many scenes throughout the film, and there's even a splice shown that for a single frame has half of one frame and half of another, with the splice line clearly seen on screen.  This was obviously taken from a projection print that is worn and damaged and not given the care and attention that it properly deserved.

The film has been released in other countries as 1080p with less compression and on dual layer blu-ray discs. This U.S. version by Image Entertainment is not that same quality. As usual, the U.S. market is treated poorly.

Why can't someone get this disc right?",1327881600,16,1461,4.507575757575758

Cue encounters with Napoleon (Ian Holm), the Titanic, Robin Hood (John Cleese), Agamemnon (Connery) and an Evil David Warner.

As one of Terry Gilliam's earliest post-Python films and apparrantly aimed at a youngish audience, you might be tempted to give this a miss, but all of Gilliam's trademark imagery, wit and style is here, full-on and in bucketloads. The balance of review markings so far suggest that even those who like his work are less than enthused about Time Bandits, but really you can't go wrong here: visually sumptuous, excellently acted, exquisitely casted, superlatively plotted and wittily written, if you've enjoyed anything by Giliam, you'll love this. Many of the themes seen in later works are evident here: children, dwarves, the power of the imagination, the struggle between good and evil, theatre and travel. Indeed Time Bandits could easily be the first of a trilogy with The Adventures Of Baron Munchausen and The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus (I've not seen The Brothers Grimm, but I suspect that it could make this a quadrilogy).

Read this checklist and decide if this movie is for you.  Do you like...

a)  the fact that Napoleon actually had a Napoleon complex and a golden hand that could be unscrewed at will?

b)  midgets who steal maps from God and go on high-stakes treasure hunting through time doors?

c)  ogors with back problems in need of chiropractic?

d)  exceptionally snobby Robin Hoods?

e)  Sean Connery fighting a Minotauresque creature?

f)  Robin Hood's assistance punching out elderly women as they receive their wealth?

g)  God looking like a Fortune 500 CEO?

h)  The devil rambling about the need to understand ""digial watches?""

Then this movie is for you!

I think the funniest part of the entire film is David Warner's ""Evil"" devil character rambling on about how God screwed up creation by omitting technology and how technology is the answer for everything. It's simply priceless!

Evil: When I have the map, I will be free, and the world will be different, because I have understanding.
Robert: Uh, understanding of what, Master?
Evil: Digital watches. And soon I shall have understanding of video cassette recorders and car telephones. And when I have understanding of them, I shall have understanding of computers. And when I have understanding of computers, I shall be the Supreme Being!

George Harrison suck out his neck to make this movie with financing and the real treat is hearing his CLASSIC tune ""Dream Away"" at the end of the movie during the credits.

And, in the beginning, the boy's parents are watching a game show, wherein the contestants are being slowly killed.

SPOILER ALERT: it turns out that the ""theft"" was arranged by God all along in order to make a trial run. So the initial history of the human race was later changed to what we know today.

Now, what I found to be hypocritical. The film was made at the time that Western Europe and North America was going through an intense Luddite-like anti-technology obsession. The film's message is that technology is, in itself, evil. So . . . the director used the latest in film technology to drive the message home that technology was evil.

However, and it's a big however, the film clearly was not properly prepared for transfer to Blu-ray (scratches, dust, poor contrast).  MGM and/or Handmade Films should have brought the master to the company - Lowry Digital - who mastered all of the James Bond films.

If you don't already own this film on DVD, then purchasing the Blu-ray might be worth your while.  Still, the better outcome for all movie fans would be for the studio to acknowledge their error and transfer this film the way it deserves to be!",1293580800,6,615,4.513513513513513

182938,4,1560689994,"This is a review of the Image Entertainment Blu-ray edition. I'll limit this review mostly to the transfer.

The transfer varies from absolutely superb to unacceptably terrible. Many scenes have a multitude of small white dots, and even vertical scratches! The black backgrounds of night scenes are often filled with noise or horizontal striations. The quality can vary radically from scene to scene, with one a model of Blu-ray quality, followed by a low-contrast, badly scratched sequence. This suggests this edition was assembled from multiple sources.

Almost all these problems are fixable -- it just takes time and money. But apparently no one wanted to spend them, even on a film that some consider a classic.

The price is reasonable for a Blu-ray disk, but ""Time Bandits"" is not of the consistent ""demo"" quality it ought to be; you might actually find it annoying to watch. There is no excuse for a 30-year-old film to be in such poor condition, especially a film from such a fussy, perfectionist director.

The film itself hasn't aged well. It's a good idea -- especially its not-very-subtle slap at the gross materialism of modern society, and the revelation of what comprises Ultimate Evil -- supported with magnificent production design, but Gilliam (and his co-writer Michael Palin) don't know how to write a terse or genuinely witty script, or give a rambling and picaresque tale the kind of focused direction it needs. (It's hard to believe Gilliam gave us ""Brazil"".)

This is a tossup. As lousy as the transfer is, the film simply /looks better/ -- /much/ better -- than any previous transfer I've seen. As we'll probably never have a properly cleaned-up edition, this might be a good time to buy the Blu-ray.

PS: I did some checking. My copy is from Image Entertainment, not Anchor Bay. The box says the transfer is 1080i (no frame rate given), but the player's screen display says it's 1080p 60fps. (The 24fps light on the player does not come on.) And in browsing reviews on a Website devoted to high-definition home videos, I discovered that ""Time Bandits"" is not the first Image Entertainment Blu-ray to be criticized for poor or inconsistent image quality.",1289606400,19,2180,4.942622950819672

No, it hasn't been scrubbed clean until the details are gone, and yes, you see the film grain in the darker scenes, but that is how if looked on movie screens when released in the 1980's. There has been some minor damage to the film over the years, but ""the worst transfer to blu ray ever?"" Hardly(My choice for worst blu ray transfer is ""28 Days Later."" Watch it and then tell me how bad this transfer is.). You will see some minor scratches on the film in the transfer. The detail of the image is beautiful and you will see many things in the background you've never noticed before. Nitpickers expecting perfection for $12.99 will be disappointed.

The only extra's included with this edition is the very funny movie trailer and a interview with Terry Gilliam which answers most of the questions most fans have asked over the years. There is no ""Making of"" feature or commentary audio, but again, look at what they are charging for it.

Sadly, horrible picture quality drags this wonderful film down.

For Amazon reviews of older movies, I tend to assume that readers have a familiarity with the film already, so I'll instead focus on the question of how well the movie transfered to the Blu Ray format. The answer? Not well at all!

In fact, I think this is the worst Blu Ray transfer I've ever seen. Artifacts abound, from lines across the screen, to random specks. It's pretty awful in parts! It feels like I'm watching an old film reel on an elementary school projector.

You'll definitely notice that no effort appeared to be spent restoring the film for this release. I'm a bit saddened by it, too, because it distracts from the enjoyment of an otherwise interesting movie.

182953,5,1560689994,"I LOVE this movie. I first saw it in the theatre when I was 5 years old. God knows what my parents were thinking when they took my sister and I to see it--I KNOW it wasn't what they were expecting. I, being 5, had no expectations, and was able to just go with it (though I still cringe when Vermin bites into the rat). I always loved the Evil Genius; he was so incompetent and petulant, he could never be really scary, and you can tell David Warner is having a great time playing him.
Though it can drag here and there (the Agamemnon section is my least favorite part), I have very fond memories of watching it as a child. I always see something ""new"", every time I watch it. Plus, it was, in a way, my introduction to Monty Python--you can't beat that.

The DVD is pretty cool; I like the photo gallery, and all the little bits and extras. Though it is informative (Jonathan Pryce was Gilliam's first choice to play Evil; and I love the bit where Gilliam expresses his disdain for child actors), my gripe about the commentary is, all the actors and Gilliam are recorded on separate tracks--there is no sitting in a room and interacting, here.

I recommend this highly for any fans of Monty Python, or of Terry Gilliam's work as a director--or to anyone looking for a truly offbeat ""children's movie"" for ages 6 and up.",1274227200,,1319,4.357723577235772

182957,3,1560689994,"I like that line.  I use it on people I know.  Well, anyway, I decided to sit down and watch this film today to see if it's worthy of a re-purchase in the future, in the Blu-Ray format.  If I didn't watch it today, I would have probably made the mistake of just going ahead and buying it again because I like films of the Sci-Fi fantasy genre.  But, as movies get older and older, and we've watched them several times over the past 20 plus years, we begin to realize that we know every next scene, and we learn that it wasn't as great as when we were unprepared for the next scene.  This movie has some great dark mid-eval scenery, but Terry Gilliam is famous for that.  I still appreciated Terry Gilliam's work at this time, because he is surely extremely strange and bizarre to me lately (""Tideland"", ""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas"", ""12 Monkeys"").  Not like his earlier Monty Python days where I appreciate a single step or two into the strange and bizarre.  He's way weird to me know.

Anyway, ""Time Bandits"" is a semi-child fantasy that gets less interesting every time I watch it again, so I may or may not be repurchasing this as a Blu-Ray DVD in the future because, although I'd like to see it in a more realistic visual high definition experience, it's still the strange story that Terry Gilliam wrote back then.  My favorite scene in the film is when they were in the cage and they cut string from the support rope of the suspended cage and made a few ropes to make an interesting, well calculated, escape from the suspended cage.  But, when we get nearer to the end of the film, we gotta wonder, did Terry Gilliam have this whole story written before he started filming, or did he just start adding things because he came to a stand-still of where to go next?

He probably thought, ""Let me think here, just to throw something bizarre and off-the-wall here, let me have Randall bust through the wall with a Sherman tank from the 1940's.  Let me see what that suggests to me so that I can finally work on an end to this movie sometime within the next 15 minutes or so.  I'm out of ideas about how to keep this story interesting so let me try to slap things together so I can get this semi-bored audience on their way home soon.""

I guess what I'm saying here is the story was sort of interesting when it started.  I enjoy it once we get past the Napoleon part, and from there forward.  But it started to lose it's charm when ""Evil"" got the map and now they must work on a reclamation and a conclusion.

It's funny (and even Terry Gilliam claimed with a tongue in cheek approval) that the critics said that the best part of this movie was the ending.  It's not the the ending was great (because it certainly wasn't).  What was meant by the ""great ending"" statement is that they were happy that it was finally over.  HA! HA!  Monty Python fans ought to appreciate that the critics statement was misinterpreted too.

Anyway, this is probably a movie that I have on DVD that would probably look great on Blu-ray Hi-Definition, but it is certainly not one of the first Blu-Ray discs that I would run out and buy.  I made an expense vow that I plan to stick to.  I will only replace my absolute favorite movies (which are about 60 of my 500+ movies) at any price under $30.  But, anything else that I already have on DVD that's not incredibly fantastic, I will only buy the new Blu-ray version if it's $9.99 or less.  I have to initiate a discipline for myself so I don't go wasting my money on replacing movies that I'll just watch again, once more maybe, and then have it just sit on my DVD shelf as a part of a proud collection that may never be watched again anytime soon.

I'm definitely going to be very selective of how I buy Blu-Ray discs.  I've bought just 8 in the past year and I still don't have a Blu-Ray disc player.  I'm just not that anxious to buy a Blu-ray disc player although I know I've bought some Blu-Ray discs where I'd like to someday see a better quality picture of a film that I truly enjoy..  When I eventually own about 25 or 30 Blu-Ray discs, I may then go out and buy my first Blu-Ray disc player.  I must maintain discipline on my Blu-Ray disc expenses!  It's very important that I live this way for my movie library.  Because, before you know it, they will eventually come out with something better than Blu-ray, like 1500p resolution.  You know, that's not too far-fetched to imagine.  Blu-Ray is simply not the end to improved video quality.  I hope you all know that.

Unfortunately, I simply wasn't able to let myself believe for the time that I watched it, but instead looked at it as a canned set piece made up by someone.

That being said, there are lots of Gilliam adds in many details that makes this special and worth seeing.  My son and I laughed at the way the giant scraped his enormous posterior on the ground.

The little theives have a special map of time and space that they stole as they travel through different times from the age of Robin Hood to the age of Titanic then they confront the forces of darkness conducted by Evil One (David Warner).

A brilliant, magicial and hilarious fantasy comedy adventure from Terry Gilliam of Monty Python is the first great of Terry Gilliam's big 80's fantasy trilogy that began with this then continued with the even better ""Brazil"" in 1985 and ended with the underrated ""Adventures of Baron Munchausen"". The film does have an all-star supporting cast such as Shelly Duvall, Katherine Helmond, Ian Holm, John Cleese, Michael Palin and Ralph Richardson to shine on the film. The script by Terry Gilliam and fellow Monty Python member Michael Palin is witty and the music score is superb even some of the few songs by George Harrison of ""Beatles"" fame whom also produced the film. The special effect are still very good even in these days of CGI and there's even a fun sense of humor that makes this a winner for everyone.

This 2-Disc DVD set has brilliant picture and sound thanks to Divamax HD and some cool extras like interview with Terry Gilliam and Michael Palin, The Directors retrospective on the films of Gilliam featurette, Trailers, a fold out map of the universe with liner note, Terry Gilliam Bio and DVD-Rom feature on the original screenplay, this is a must have for the fantasy collection.

The first was that it was directed by Terry Gilliam of Monty Python and the other was the kooky plot and characters. But they were reasons to make me watch the movie. I fell in love with it after a couple of viewings. I have to praise Terry Gilliam for directing Heath Ledger in his last role after The Dark Knight. The Criterion DVD is still good by the way. Despite the non-anamorphic transfer, this is still a good DVD. Criterion does a fantastic job with their titles and this one is no disappointment. Hey, the movie was released in 1981 and you gotta give it that. I did want to get the Special Edition from Anchor Bay, but the Criterion version spotted my eyes first and the rest is history. I have the Criterion DVD of Time Bandits! And the day after tomorrow...... THE WORLD!!! AHAHAHA!!!",1221436800,,916,4.394117647058824
182977,5,1560689994,"I had a strong reaction to people's negative comments about this movie... I must admit, when I saw the movie in the theater, I can remember it being much more fast-paced then when I saw it for the second time on dvd in the 2000s...I also remember it being funnier...And I suppose the special effects are not up to modern standards... But to call Time Bandits ""dated, dumb, and dull,"" as one reviewer wrote, is in my opinion a great injustice to a great movie.

People have to realize- Time Bandits is NOT truly a comedy or even a fantasy/sci fi movie- and those elements of comedy and sci fi/fantasy that exist in the movie are incidental to its true purpose:  being a social/philosophical commentary on the evils/perversions that technology, when left unchecked, can impose on us (or more accurately: how we impose technology on ourselves and others, especially our children), and how people can lose their souls when they love and desire things, money, and power instead of  people/living things, morals, and love- which are the truly important things in life. And considering how more than ever before (because there is more technology and things available to us than ever before), almost all of we Americans are about our things, acquiring more things, and having more than the Joneses next door, I think Time Bandits is MUCH more relevant, and has much more to teach us NOW, than when it came out (1981).

Since my second viewing of Time Bandits, I have watched the movie more times, and it grows on me more every time. I love the points Time Bandits subtly makes, as well as the thoughts, imagination, ideas, ideals, and feelings of adventure it provokes... I love the general feel that the movie has. Time Bandits is a great movie, and is considered to be a cult-classic by many-  but if you are only into the all-too common modern mindless cookie-cutter films, which lack any real deepness, originality or imagination, you might want to rent this one first before purchasing it.",1219881600,3,1986,4.761627906976744

182979,1,1560689994,"My husband, 11 year old daughter, and I watched TIME BANDITS the other evening.  My husband remembered it from his college days as being extremely funny, and thought we would all enjoy it.  The whole family loves British comedy, and we were really looking forward to this.  Unfortunately, TIME BANDITS has not held up well over the years.  We all sat there a bit glassy-eyed and slack-jawed, waiting for the laughs.

For some reason that I cannot quite my finger on, this film just isn't funny anymore (if it ever was).  With supposedly Monty Python-esque humor, I would have thought that TIME BANDITS would have become a sort of timeless classic similar to the Monty Python films.  But what works for Monty Python, what makes THEM classic, doesn't work or is severely lacking in TIME BANDITS.

The plot is old, predictable, disjointed, and, quite frankly, boring.  The pace is plodding and tedious.  The special effects, while they may possibly have been innovative in 1981, look cheap and cheesy.  The acting, from this ""all star"" cast is mostly dreadful, although John Cleese and Sean Connery both deliver their typical fine performances.  The ending is bizarre, and while I understand what the director was going for, fails miserably.  And, as others have stated over and over, the quality of the disk transfer is just horrible - dark, jumpy, and full of artifacts.

I was temped to give this a two-star rating based solely on the performances John Cleese and Sean Connery, but why bother?  You can see both of them in much better films.  TIME BANDITS is dated, dumb, and dull.  NOT RECOMMENDED.",1215907200,12,1599,4.841328413284133
182980,3,1560689994,"Terry Gilliam movies are a mixed bag, but rest assured they are always going to be surreal.  The silly premise of a band of international thieves stealing a map from the Supreme Being and running amuck with comic escapades involving historical figures is wonderfully goofy gold mine to work with.  Unfortunately, many of the scenes are just not that funny.  Napolean's obsession with short people was just obvious and was pretty dull to watch.  The scenes involving ancient Greece, outside of a great festival scene, was slow moving and didn't really do much to advance the plot.  The Robin Hood scene, on the other hand, was hilarious, as well as the recurring joke with two lovers they constantly interfere with.

The villain, who else but The Evil Genius, was hilarious, and the movie kicked in to full gear when the band set out into the ""Time of Legends"".  The chaos on the screen in the climactic battle made up for some of the misses in the film.

Oh, and there's satire of materialism, some theological studies, and an extremely amusing conception of The Supreme Being at the end.  Overall, it's all too odd to feel you're being beaten over the head any of the underlying messages, and just adds to the general weirdness.

Not Gilliam's best, but good when you're in the mood for something completely different.",1209168000,,1319,4.770925110132159
182981,5,1560689994,"Chalk another one up that many people laugh at me when I mention this movie. What is funny was my father who couldn't stand this movie every time I was watching it and I had to turn the channel. After a few hundred times, he gave in, and likes it now.

Basically, a band of dwarves work for the ""supreme being."" They ""borrowed"" a map that can lead them to time portals anywhere. Little did Randall who was the leader of this group realize that the Supreme Being also created evil who was played by the lengendary all around evil actor, David Warner (Jack the Ripper in Time After Time, and the master controller in Tron). It also stars Monty Python regulars; Michael Palin (wrote it also) and John Cleese. While Randall and his crew are trying to slip away from the Supreme Being, they end up in a little boys room (Kevin played by Craig Warnock) and take him with them as the Supreme Being once again catches up with them. They have to worry about him as well as Evil who wants the map for his own personal gain (to rule the world). Throughout the movie you meet, Sean Connery who plays a king in ancient history as well as the British fireman who on a call is sent to Kevin's house, Napoleon, Ogres, and Robin Hood (John Cleese). Who will succeed? Evil? The Supreme Being? Randall and his band of thieves? Will Kevin be able to go home?

Delightful movie with a decent amount of comedy. The adventure and silliness certainly smells like a Monty Python movie. John Cleese always seems to get the right parts that fit him (except Rat Race). This is a fun and enjoyable action/comedy for the family. It certainly has got some history in it (the past). Randall and his little gang of thieves (since they lie and steal) might throw a red flag to parents and the floating head of the Supreme Being might scare some children but it's still enjoyable after 27 years. As always, Davind Warner plays a good evil character. My favorite was him as well as The Supreme Being. At first it was scary seeing just a head chase you, but I like when he would appear and say,"" Stop!"" Give back what you have stolen from me."" Return the map!""

There was talk of a sequel but Randall died as well as Wally (jack Purvis) in the same year, and the sequel was axed.",1207872000,3,2242,4.358851674641149

Not that Chris Columbus didn't do a decent job, but it just makes you wonder what that film would have been like with someone as creative and original as Terry Gilliam at the helm.

Time Bandits is very original and very enjoyable - even today. It holds up very well, despite some of its special effects being very dated by today's standards (doesn't bother me though, there is something more organic about using models and puppets instead of computers and green screens).

Some of the themes may be a little intense for children, but I think most will enjoy this charming adventure story. Gilliam had children in mind while filming this, and it shows. I read that he shot most of the scenes with mid/low angle shots to replicate a child's view-point - very neat.

I can't recommend this film highly enough, it is one of my all time favorites. It has everything: great writing, remarkable characters and breathtaking visuals.",1188086400,,1067,4.751351351351351

182986,4,1560689994,"British humor is unique and could be considered an art form in and of itself.  British humor in the form of a science-fiction adventure movie is something else altogether.  This movie, along with Brazil and the Adventures of Baron Munchausen, form a trilogy of fantasy classics by Terry Gilliam.  Whereas Brazil is more of an apocalyptic view of the future, and Baron Munchausen is steeped in Greek mythology and European history, this movie is more of a pure adventure story with lots of ridiculous scenes thrown in.

The plot of Time Bandits is simple.  Six dwarfs, servants of God, steal God's map of time-space and use it travel throughout human history.  They stop at various times and places to steal loot from wealthy individuals, such as Napoleon (Ian Holm) and King Agamemnon (Sean Connery).  Along the way, the sink with the Titanic, and get robbed by Robin Hood (John Cleese).  They pick up an English boy living at the end of the 20th century, and bring him along in their travels.  In the end, they encounter Evil himself, and have to be rescued by God.

This movie is classic British humor.  Sarcasm and wit overflow; action scenes are funny because of how ludicrous they are, and scene after scene pokes fun at the powerful.  The scenes with the dwarfs are also great, as they alternate between hitting each other Three Stooges style to performing feats worthy of any circus.  For such an old movie, the film quality was great.  The special effects were believable, but did not distract from the storyline.  The dialog was also good.  Unfortunately, the soundtrack was nondescript, and parts of it sounded like it was copied from The Adventures of Baron Munchausen.

Well, there is something to English hilarity; that dry, mature comedy that carries with it an adolescent streak Americans too often translate as juvenile in their our own format. True, Gilliam is American, but his humor is far from. In Time Bandits, one of his best works, we get to travel alongside the Supreme Being's ousted aides as they try to find a new living as time traveling thieves. Of course they fail at every turn until their greed lands them in the hands of Evil himself. David Warner is the stand out in this movie. I literally love every performance he has ever done. And Sean Connery, who knew he could give a subtle, unselfish performance. There are plot holes which nagged at me, especially the point that everyone, no matter the era, speaks English!

182995,4,1560689994,"This is a film that I first saw when I was about 11.  Many would claim that it makes no sense, but it jives pretty well with me.  Basic plot: The Supreme Being does outsourcing, that is to say that all of creation was handled by sub-contractors.  However, there were issues with budgeting time, resources etc. and holes in the continuity of reality turned up as a result.  A group of disgruntled dwarf-employees decide that they're fed up with low standards of living and the hard work of maintaining creation by patching these holes.  So they go rogue, and use a stolen map to attempt to turn a profit via time travel.  The problems arise when the personification of evil decided to attempt to master the nuances of creation and reality, and so begins pursuing the band of dwarves, who happen to stumble upon the main protagonist, appropriately a young boy, while jumping through time.

For a film of its era, Time Bandits has a lot going for it.  It features the ""special effects that aren't so special"" that Doctor Who fans will wax reminicent about, but this is forgivable when compared to the sheer scope of creative vision.  This is the sort of piece that will inspire you pursue your own creative ventures in the realms of fantasy and temporal manipulation.

If you put a crossbow to my head and made me come up with a simple way to describe it, I would say it is the ""anti-Wizard of Oz"".  I am sure that I am not the only person to have thought of that, because it is fairly obvious when you look at the film just a bit and think about the two side-by-side.

However, this movie has some wonderful twists in the way it mixes, history, legend, fantasy, and the kinds of adventures small boys used to read about and dreamt of before their imaginations were sucked away into video games of various degrees of hideousness.  However, this film is also a great deal of fun for adults, especially if you are a Gilliam-Monty Python fan.

Now that the film is more than twenty-five years old it certainly holds a different place in the popular culture than it did when it first came out.  We see the actors who have passed on, gotten older, and grown up and we feel a nostalgia we could never have felt when it first came out.  Of course, kids seeing it for the first time won't feel that, but they do notice it as ""old"" because of the way the special effects were done.

The only post-Python Gilliam-directed film I can recommend is 12 Monkeys.  In films like Brazil and Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, Gilliam hits us with crazy visuals...acid trips and fantasies...that go on and on and on until the credits roll.  No plot, no involvement, no point at all.

If you've ever seen Lost in La Mancha, you were probably saddened by all the events that led to the cancellation of Gilliam's Don Quixote film...from the lead actor breaking bones, to a flood that destroyed expensive equipment.  But after seeing some of Gilliam's other films, I'm now convinced that those events were:

""A blessing!  A blessing from the Lord!  God be praised!""",1125360000,5,738,4.84
183006,4,1560689994,"`Time Bandits' is, I believe, Terry Gilliam's first movie direction outside the imprimatur of the Monty Python brand and the first of a long series of highly quirky fantasies, leading up to the soon to be released `The Brothers Grimm'.

`Time Bandits' has been so overshadowed by later successes such as `Brazil' and '12 Monkeys', mediocre efforts such as `The Fisher King', and flops such as `Baron Munchausen' that it is not even mentioned in reviews of `The Brothers Grimm'. For that oversight, I hope to shine just a little attention on the film with this review.

In some ways, it is similar to the famous `Monty Python and the Holy Grail' in its being a string of not very clearly related episodes connected by the diminutive `time bandits' journey from one era to another through a series of portals they find using a very durable linen looking map of space and time, which they say they have stolen from the supreme being. Their initial motive seems a bit weak in that they are miffed at being employed by this same Supreme Being in the creation and maintenance of trees. The plot develops as they take on a young English schoolboy as a traveling companion and attract the attention of a very evil magical being, similar to the devil, but much more petulant and limited than the classic depiction's by, for example, Dante and Milton. This evil being, imprisoned in a dark fortress which would make Sauron jealous, is played to the hilt by David Warner, who succeeds in not taking himself very seriously, thereby maintaining the fantastic feel to the story.

The six time bandits are excellently played by six dwarf actors, the most famous of whom is Kenny Baker, the human working the controls of the `Star Wars' `droid, R2-D2. On the road through various time portals, we meet Napoleon, played by Ian Holm (primarily famous as the actor playing Bilbo Baggins in `Lord of the Rings'), Robin Hood, played by John Cleese (famous Monty Python alumni and pitchman), and Agamemnon played by Sean Connery (famous for just about every role under the sun). Holm's and Cleese's parts are played for laughs. Connery's part, introduced as young Craig Warnock's character drops through a time portal onto the scene of a hand to hand combat between Agamemnon and the Minotaur, is played straight. In some ways Connery's part, in spite of his second billing behind Cleese, is the most important role among all the `guest star' roles. Rounding out the cast is co-author Michael Palin and Shelley Duvall who appear in two pair of incidental roles, Katherine Helmond in another incidental role (Helmond plays much more important roles in some of Gilliam's later movies), and Ralph Richardson as `the supreme being' in the flesh, distinguished from the disembodied head and voice which pursues the time bandits now and then. In all these cases, the casting takes care of half the work of fitting the performances to the script.

A small but important contributor to this movie is George Harrison, the money source behind the production company, Handmade Films. Harrison also provides a fairly pleasant original song and performance played over the ending credits roll.

As fantasy comedies go, this doesn't quite stand up to the great classics, lead by Shakespeare's `A Midsummer Night's Dream' and `The Wizard of Oz'. The story simply does not hold together well enough and too many events have that `deux ex machina' air about them due to there being virtually no setup making the transition plausible within the logic of this fantasy premise.

The primary virtue of the movie, aside from the performances from the six time bandit characters, is in the inventiveness of Gilliam and Palin in the turns within each scene. It also helps if you happen to be a fan of Gilliam's works, as one can sense some of the bittersweet tones which would blossom in `Brazil' and the problems of time travel more fully explored in '12 Monkeys'. While these latter movies have much better plots, one can enjoy the craziness in this movie for its own sake.

Recommended for fans of fantasy, comedy, Monty Python, and Terry Gilliam movies. It may be just a bit too strung out for people who like well-crafted plots.

Note that this version has very few extras, but the video quality is quite acceptable. Unless an enhanced version has a running commentary from Gilliam or Palin, I would stick with this inexpensive version.",1125100800,5,4395,4.858477970627503

183008,5,1560689994,"In view of the sheer output of Monty Python, the term ""Monty Python"" could be interpreted to mean an entire genre.  The Meaning of Life, for example, is one of the finest offerings that Monty Python has bequeathed upon humanity.  The first 20 minutes of The Meaning of Life is, arguably, the most astonishing 20 minute sequence in the entire history of film.  The Meaning of Life deserves at least 5 stars.  But movie under review, Time Bandits, deserves no more than 3 stars.  First of all, the videotape is unconscionably blurry.  Unlike films such as As Good As It Gets or Sleepless in Seattle, which can be enjoyed as a radio show, Time Bandits derives its attraction from its visuals, e.g., period costumes and science fiction special effects.  Hence, much is lost in the videotape.  And for that matter, unless you have a high definition television, much would also be lost with viewing from a DVD and an ordinary TV.  Time Bandits really cannot compete with other fantasy and science fiction movies from the early 1980s.  Time Bandits was released during the same time frame as, e.g., Indian Jones, Superman, and Poltergeist.  In Time Bandits, the actors materialize in different historical situations, and visit, e.g., Napoleon, Robin Hood, a Greek emporor, and The Titanic.  But what happens during most of these encounters is not really coherent and does not make for appealing viewing.  Most irritating is the finale, which involves extensive and arbitrary use of explosions and smoke bombs.  Is there anything good that I can say about Time Bandits?  Yes.  I very much admired the extensive use of the Andante from Mahler's Sixth Symphony in the soundtrack.  It was also nice to hear a George Harrison composition during the final credits.",1104278400,2,1751,4.921501706484642

Definitely not something I'd expect from a Criterion Collection release.

Actually, the previous non-Criterion release, though it has no commentary, and is a lower quality transfer, seems to be transferred from less damaged film, and has fewer flecks and holes in the film!

They are stealing things of value from history via a time portal owned by a supreme being. Kevin joins them for the sake of an adventure away from his parents and they are all chased from historical events by a variety of famous figures and chased by not only the supreme being but a very evil genius as well.

I loved this movie the first time I saw it.  I rode my bicycle to the theater several times to watch this film (a child's matinee price was only $2.00).  I must have seen it six times on the screen.

""Time Bandits"" is packed with the signature humor that characterizes Terry Gilliam and his Monty Python's buddies: John Cleese, Eric Idle and Michael Palin (co-writers of the script along Gilliam). This is not a conventional movie, the main characters are portrayed by charismatic dwarfs and a young kid. Even though actors like Sean Connery and Ian Holm have the main credits, the real protagonists are the little guys.

""Time Bandits"" is a story filled with fantasy and magic situations, all these guys travel across time to meet with famous people, and to steal their treasures with the help of a magic map. Terry Gilliam and his Monty Python buddies really are very creative and original people, they have crafted an unique style that distinguish them from the rest of the comedians.

""Time Bandits"" built the foundations for movies like ""Brazil"" and ""12 Monkeys"", movies where Terry Gilliam improved his formula that combines social satire, science-fiction and black comedy (and some religious references as well, like God and the Devil).

183017,4,1560689994,"""Time Bandits"" is an interesting comedy from the very early eighties that if you're interested in dry English humor will no doubt be very entertaining for you.  I distinctly remember watching this movie on HBO repeatedly and enjoying as thoroughly as if it were an Oscar winning masterpiece, that is of course, when I was fourteen or so.  I hadn't watched the film in several years and was overjoyed when hearing it would be released on DVD once again.  Having now watched it again after so many years, I would have to say that it is seen quite differently through the eyes of a mid thirty year old as opposed to an early teenager.  Don't get me wrong though, this movie is quite funny and entertaining and worth the meager cost for the DVD, especially considering the DiViMax format.
Contributing greatly to this movies success of so many years ago is its impressive list of stars.  Of even greater interest is the fact that many of the biggest names starring in this English comedy is that they weren't even in the lead roles.  With a list including the likes of Sean Connery, John Cleese, Shelley Duvall and David Warner, it may be easy to forget that the primary stars of this film were the midgets, all of which did a great job with their respective roles and, not to mention, a young Craig Warnock in the lead role of Kevin.
Of even greater interest with this film is one of the Executive Producers which was none other than George Harrison, as in George Harrison from the Beatles.  He was also responsible for the songs for the film as well.
""Time Bandits"" was directed by Terry Gilliam whom many may recognize as the director for many ""Monty Python"" films, does a very good job with the film.  One of the most important aspects one may wish to remember if you're looking to watch this film for the first time is when this film was made which was in the eighties and the technology available at that time.  Graphically, this film was well ahead of its time when it hit the theaters.
The Premise:
Kevin (Craig Warnock), a young English boy, is sent off to bed by his parents and after he turns the light out, his closet starts shaking furiously and before he knows it, a knight on horseback appears right there in his bedroom and then shortly thereafter the knight disappears and the room is back to normal.  The next night, Kevin is sitting there with a Polaroid waiting on something else to happen and just as he gives up and decides to go to sleep, the closet starts shaking again...
What follows from there is a very interesting comedy in which young Kevin finds himself following a band of midgets through time as they use a map that they've stolen from the ""Supreme Being"" and they intend to rob as many people as they can.
I would definitely recommend this film to any and all that enjoys comedies, especially British comedies and the typical brand of humor that implies, especially ""Monty Python"" type comedies.  {ssintrepid}

183018,5,1560689994,"PLEASE NOTE: THIS REVIEW WAS WRITTEN FOR THE TWO DVD DISC EDITION OF ""TIME BANDITS"" PUT OUT BY ANCHOR BAY.

First, I have to note that most of these reviews are for the somewhat disappointing Criterion Edition released in 1999. The version I'll be reviewing is the much improved Divimax (high definition digital transfer)from Anchor Bay. The two DVD edition of Time Bandits from Anchor Bay has isn't perfect but it's a stark improvement on the previous no frills version they issued in 1999 and the Criterion Edition from the same time frame.

The high definition transfer and the fact that the film has been enhanced for 16x9 televisions are definite improvements on the previous edition. The picture is sharper although I did note some minor edge enhancement and digital compression issues. On the whole, though, the picture looks marvelous. The first disc features only the film and it doesn't have the great audio commentary compilation by Gilliam, Michael Palin, David Warner, John Cleese and Craig Warnock. That's a pity because that would have made this the ultimate edition of the film.

Now the major complaint from some folks regarding the image size. Gilliam shot Time Bandits to be shown theatrically in a 1.85:1 ratio. Time Bandits was probably shot full screen (like Kubrick's films so that they wouldn't be badly ""cropped"" when released). More than likely Gilliam matted the image AFTER the film was shot. The widescreen image IS the way Gilliam intended the film to be seen).

The worst looking DVD was the one put out by the highly regarded Criterion Company. It featured interlace problems, an unstable picture (perhaps due to a flaw during the telecine transfer)and sound that sound left much to be desired. The aspect ratio (the dimension of the width and heighth of the film on screen)is correct here and the beautifully detailed transfer is so sharp that, on occasion, you can even see the limitations (there's a hint of wires in some scenes)of Terry Gilliam's optical effects.

NOTE UPDATE 9/28/10: THE BLU-RAY EDITION PUT OUT BY ANCHOR BAY HAS MANY PROBLEMS. I MENTION THIS HERE BECAUSE THIS HAS BEEN GROUPED IN WITH THE BLU-RAY REVIEW AS WELL. THE IMAGE QUALITY ISN'T ALL THAT GREAT AND HAS INTERLACE PROBLEMS AND WAS TRANSFERRED AT 1080I NOT 1080P WHICH MEANS THERE IS A REDUCTION IN IMAGE QUALTIY. WE ONLY GET AN 18 MINUTE INTERVIEW WITH GILLIAM ALONG WITH THE TRAILER FOR THE FILM NOTHING ELSE FROM THE 2 DISC EDITION FROM 2004. I WOULD WAIT FOR A BETTER BLU-RAY TRANSFER FOR THE FILM. GIVEN THE FILM STOCK THAT ""TIME BANDITS"" WAS SHOT WITH, THE AGE OF THE FILM, ETC. YOU MAY NOT SEE A HUGE IMPROVEMENT IN THE BLU-RAY EDITION OF THE FILM (QUITE HONESTLY IT DEPENDS ON YOUR MONITOR, SIZE, ETC.).

THE REGION ""B"" BLU-RAY ISN'T A HUGE IMPROVEMENT OVER THE U.S. RELEASE.

The soundtrack has been remixed for the Dolby Digital EX track although I much preferred the more natural sounding 5.1 mix. Since the original source material was designed for stereo and there were some recording limitations at the time the film was made, the tinny sound is still a bit of a problem. That's not a problem that can be easily solved unfortunately. Still, Anchor Bay does the best they can with the materials at hand.

The second disc contains all the extras. The feaurettes include the marvelous The Directors: The films of Terry Gilliam with interviews featuring Gilliam, Shelly Duvall, Brad Pitt, Amanda Plummer, Mercedes Ruehl, Madeleine Stowe and David Warner. There's also an interview with Gilliam and Palin as well as the original theatrical trailers for the film. Some of these features duplicate comments heard on the commentary track for the film from Criterion.

UPDATE: 9/28/10-THE BLU-RAY EDITION HAS NO SECOND DISC. IT DOES FEATURE AN ENTERTAINING 18 MINUTE INTERVIEW WITH GILLIAM AND THE TRAILER.

There's also a Terry Gilliam bio and, most importantly, a DVD-Rom version of the original screenplay. Both these features are no where else to be found. Anchor Bay includes a fold out Map of the Universe which also has a background on the film production.

UPDATE 9/28/10: THE SCREENPLAY AND THE FOLD OUT MAP ARE NOT INCLUDED WITH THE BLU-RAY.

ADVICE FOR THE BLU-RAY: WAIT UNTIL ANCHOR BAY DOES A DECENT JOB OR THERE IS A RESTORATION FOR THIS FINE FILM FOR BLU-RAY.",1076198400,374,4290,4.877747252747253

There are a couple things that need to be clarified though:
1) the film is a) NOT a Monty Python film, it is a Terry Gilliam film; and b) NOT a comedy like Python films but a dark comedy/fable like Brazil.
2) the Criterion version is ""Director Approved."" That means it's shown the way the director intended. As one other review thanklessly pointed out, letterboxing does crop some of the picture, but that's how it's shown in the theater.

183025,4,1560689994,"If you enjoy films that make you laugh and then later make you think, then I would definately recommend ""Time Bandits"". As I child, I watched this movie with my dad, appreciating only that little men were singing ""Me and my Shadow"" to Napoleon (played wonderfully by Ian Holm). Now, I'm a little wiser, and I see the more theological levels to this film - the temptation of evil, the realization of good, etc.  I will say this: don't look too hard for these morals, or you'll miss out on a really funny movie. It's a bit of history, mixed with theology, sprinkled with fantasy and set in at least six different time periods. Plus, Evil's fascination with machinery is hilarious, and quite telling to any of us who have had issues with people and cell phones, computers, etc.!
  As a DVD however, ""Time Bandits"" is not the best. Though I usually enjoy just watching the film, I found the extras to be basically non-existent (the trailer is funny as a time piece).

183026,4,1560689994,"I recently purchased this film on DVD and I must say that I'm a little disappointed at how the DVD release of this film was handled.  First of all, the DVD I purchased only includes chapter selections and a theatrical trailor.  WHAT????  No behind the scenes featurette nor commentary.  I understand that the Criterion version is better, but, I had a hard time trying to find this film on DVD, so, I picked up the first copy I saw.  Plus, it's not mastered to 5.1 stereo surround.  I wanted to give my system a workout with this film.
Anyway, the film itself is almost flawless despite the DVD release.  I remember watching this film on THE MOVIE CHANNEL several times back in 1982 (when I was about 7, of course).  No matter what part I would come in at, I watched it to the end over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over again.  I guess you can say that I really love this movie.  Looking at it now, I can say that this film indirectly is pretty educational.  Think about it.  The characters in this film go through various points of history and legends:  Napoleon, Robin Hood, Greek Legends, the sinking of the Titanic, etc.  I love this film even more now than I did then.  This film also recognizes the spiritual aspects of life and time.  For example:  The Supreme Being (GOD - The Almighty Father) and the evil genious (Satan).  All elements affect mans lifetime and history.  Praise GOD.  No other fantasy film before nor after this classic has ever acknowledged GOD.  Shame on them!!
Anyway, if you want a timeless classic to add to your collection, this is it.  Now, if only they can get it right with the DVD release and stop clowning around with the hearts of those who really love this film.",1054944000,3,1729,4.405063291139241

It never ceases to amaze me how, even after all these years, I always find something new during each viewing.  A group of dwarves steal a map of the universe from God and then set out to become international thieves. They work for God in the shrubbery department. When God docks their pay for making a particularly awful shrubbery, the dwarves become disgruntled and steal the map. Along the way they kidnap an eight year old boy named kevin and take him on a wild series of adventures.  All of their adventures take place in different historical periods. (The universe was a botch job. It was made in seven days. Holes were left in the fabric of the universe. When the dwarves travel through the holes they are able to visit different historical periods.) One of my favorite scenes takes place when the dwarves rob Napoleon, played by Ian Holm. After viewing a Punch and Judy show Napoleon shouts, ""That's what I like to see, little people hitting one another!"" Another wonderful bit takes place later when Robin Hood, played by John Cleese, refers to one of his merry men as Marion. The costumes are marvelous. All of the sets in Time Bandits look larger than life. Terry Gilliam achieved the film's grand scale by shooting from the point of view of the dwarves. He simply pointed the camera up because everything looks bigger when you're four feet tall. Most people in my generation, when asked what movies made a memorable impression on them when they were young, would probably mention Star Wars and Raiders of the Lost Ark.

Dwarfs (time bandits) have stolen a map from the Supereme Being that pinpoints gaps in the time continuum.  They get the idea to go back in time and steal priceless artifacts and treasures from different eras while at the same time avoiding being apprehended by the Supreme Being.

If you like Monty Python, the movie Willow, the fantasy genre, and comedy, you will LOVE this movie!  A lot of people missed this movie when it came out in theatres, I wasn't one of them.  I love this movie and could watch it again and again.  I kept hoping they would come out with a sequel to it, and I'd heard rumors of a sequel, but nothing ever came of that.  Somehow, this movie slipped through the cracks in reviews, and it shouldn't have.  A star-filled cast, an hilarious plotline, and nice visual effects... what more do you want in a film?",1038268800,2,691,4.3515625
183033,3,1560689994,"Everyone seems to either love or hate this film.  I'm sort of in the middle.  It's mainly about a kid and some dwarves on a time-traveling adventure so there are many mini-adventures to be had by these characters along the way.  Therein lies the problem as some segments work much better than others.  There are some fun or interesting places they go to(like meeting up with Robin Hood), but other times you'd wish they'd just hurry up to their next adventure(meeting Napolean was kinda boring).
Nevertheless, I can still recommend at least a viewing because there is a sense of grand adventure here as some segments are very enjoyable.  The visuals in the film are also very unique, as any adventure/fantasy film worth its salt should have that sense of ""i've never seen anything like that before"" in them.  Trust me, you'll get that feeling while watching it(despite no elaborate cgi-efx available at the time).  In fact, I think the last 15 or so minutes is worth a rental price alone.  The very ending however...well, let's just say that you'll either have a grin on your face, be scratching your head in confusion, or tearing your hair out of frustration:)  Btw, I got the regular dvd version with no extras so i missed out on the commentary track :(",1036022400,,1255,4.69406392694064
183034,5,1560689994,"Firstly, this review is of the Criterion edition of this movie, not any other edition. I cannot speak to the quality or features of any other edition.
This is a GREAT movie - if you measure greatness by the following criteria:
 - it is visually stunning, with sets and effects that are simply breathtaking.
 - it is accessible to all audiences, and very entertaining.
 - it has a deeper meaning, relating education as good, and ignorance as evil.
There are many scenes that are so funny as to be beyond description, as we see the pathetic offerings of tv game shows, the blank goodness of John Cleese as Robin Hood, and the bizarre ramblings of Ian Holm as Napoloen. (The last was so funny that Terry Gilliam had to leave the set, because his laughter was spoiling the takes.)
There are many visually astounding moments, such as the attempts by the bandits to escape the cages, and the shock of the horse and rider crashing through the boy's bedroom at the film's opening.
The Criterion edition is, of course, absolutely marvelous, with an almost perfect picture marred only by a few specks of dust, and the best possible stereo sound from the original mixes. There is also the original trailer, which is a gem in itself. The commentary is well done, although I prefer to hear a bit more of the soundtrack underneath a commentary.
Very well done!",1035590400,4,1346,4.647058823529412

183037,5,1560689994,"I will not go into the plot because the whole experience of ""Time Bandits"" should be a total surprise the first time around! I will say that it's my third favorite Gilliam movie after ""Brazil"" and ""12 Monkeys"" and when I first saw it I was totally blown away. The screenplay, written by Gilliam and supporting actor Palin, tries to escape from the Star Wars mind set that took over Hollywood around that time. Infact, all elements of this movie work so hard to run away from the usual rules of the American screenplay. Another aspect of this film is the production design and special effects that are quiet compared to all those space ship explosions that we're so used to. The effects are only used as a tool over the plot line being guided around them. I respect Criterion for this DVD but I think they could have gone a bit farther. While their ""Brazil"" DVD really pushed the features, ""Bandits"" only has a single scrap book. I wanted more. But the print is lovely and the commentary is worth listening to, even though I don't think Gilliam is that talented at doing it. His two subjects tend to be ""Dissing America"" and ""Hatred for TV,"" which is okay but gets dull after a while.",1028332800,8,1183,4.481481481481482

This mystery reviewer said it was a terrible movie, who would run from a god? Did they think they would win. Hello! Its a movie. Just like those of us who like the Star Wars movies do not really think there is a 7 foot walking carpet out there we do not think someone would run from a god. It is a movie. A great movie, with great directing and great acting. It""s more about a young boy finding a family among dwarve thieves becasue his parents are to wrapped up in the televeision and material goods to even think about their son.

From the beginning I could tell that this flic was going to hurt. It started out slow and boring and then out of nowhere midget pirates show up in this kids bedroom! After that I went numb and skimmed it over lightly. I don't even remember Micheal Palin being in it but I did like John Cleese as Robin Hood. Please if you have a soul don't watch this movie.

183041,5,1560689994,"In case some of the other reviewers are confused, this film has been presented in the aspect ratio that the director intended it to be in.  Yes, the VHS edition shows ""more of the frame"", but the film was shot with the intention of ""matting out"" the top and bottom of the screen for theatrical distribution.  Therefore in the VHS ""full-screen"" version, you are only seeing ""more"" of what the director DOESN'T WANT YOU TO SEE.
Although I understand the frustration of those who are used to seeing the ""TV"" version, this transfer preserves the integrity of the film as a work of art.  That may sound pretensious, but as someone who has much respect for Auteurs like Terry Gilliam, I'm sure I come off as pretensious most of the time.
Oh yeah, this film is also EXCELLENT, but it's still no BRAZIL.
PS:  MOST films, with the exception of those shot in Anamorphic or Super 35, are shot in full-frame and then matted for projection.  The stuff that the letterboxing ""blocks out"" is, for the most part, junk.  Of course, there are exceptions.  Such as when a filmmaker wants the frame to look good in a theatre as well as on television.  See Kubrik's ""Eyes Wide Shut"" (co-written by Frederic Raphael) for a good example of this.",1011225600,10,1222,4.573394495412844
183042,5,1560689994,"I saw Time Bandits many times when it was on cable back in the early '80s, so it is nice to have it preserved forever on DVD. The commentary by Terry Gilliam, Michael Palin, John Cleese, David Warner, and Craig Warnock is a nice idea, as you don't get those moments of silence that one often gets when a director does a commentary on his own. They all seem to have clear memories of the film and have interesting stories and insights about the film. The Scrapbook is ok, with photos of production and such finishing up with a photo of Gilliam and Warnock (who played the young boy, Kevin) from 1997. The trailer is terrific fun and offbeat. It's great to see a movie trailer that is out of the ordinary.
The film itself is great from start to finish. The time travel element is realized in a creative way and adds a bit of excitement to the story. From Kevin almost getting the father of his dreams (as played by Sean Connery), meeting Robin Hood (John Cleese) who comes off like a member of the royal family, ending up on the Titanic, and much more.
Reading the reviews of Time Bandits, people seem to really love this film or really hate it. The folks who love it seem to like to go into great detail as to why they love it and the people who hated seem to just write one or two lines of text about how the movie was awful. If you hate the movie, tell us why. A review that simply says 'This movie was awful' along with several other reviews describing in detail how great a film is will probably act as encouragement to buy the DVD.",1010275200,13,1535,4.242320819112628
183043,5,1560689994,"Where director Terry Gilliam scores highly, quite apart from the casting coups of Richardson and Connery, is that the film sees things from the child's point of view. this is good both for children watching the film, and for any adults who still have a child-like sense of fun and adventure. This is aided by clever casting of midgets in the principle roles and a capable and likeable actor as 'point of identification' Kevin. Whilst it's not so surprising to see them, John Cleese and Michael Palin also turn in good performances, as do the other members of the star-studded cast. The visuals are suitably surreal and imaginative with my favourite scene being the boat on top of the island which turns out to be the giant's head. There are plenty of other set pieces which show Gilliam's skill as a designer (he storyboarded the whole film) as well as director. The story itself has some good dialogue (the script was co-written by Gilliam and Michael Palin) and a plot which is as full as it needs to be to move from set piece to set piece, and leads us to an ultimately satisfying yet unexpected ending.",1007510400,7,1106,4.619289340101523

One of the most imaginative, spell-binding stories ever put to contemporary film. On the surface it's a fun flick graced with the intensity of Sean Connery, the innocent splendor of the lovely Shelly Duval, and the obscenely masterful comic of Michael Palin and John Cleese. But taken in context of the Trilogy, as I understand it, comprised of Time Bandits, Brazil, and The Adventures of Baron Munchuesen, the film captures the sheer ludiocrisy of life as a child in a world of mindless adults as only Terry Gilliam in his brilliance could portray. A true masterpiece That I personaly feel is matched only by Brazil in painful satirical ingenuity. Top marks, Mr. Gilliam.

The plot is funny, yet thoughtful at the same time, playing with the idea of ""what if god left some things undone, having created the world in only 7 days?"" the dialogue is cynical and ironic, at times. The cast list is wonderful. Contrary to the information that Sean Connery stars in this, he does not. He is simply the most well-known. His part isn't insignifigant exactly, but not that big. The real star of the film is, well, everyone, come to think of it. Python fanatics, such as myself, will be entertained with appearances by John Cleese and Michael Palin, both of whom have probably the funniest scenes in the whole film.

183049,5,1560689994,"For those who think that they haven't seen ""Time Bandits"": you're probably wrong. I was surprised at how many of the scenes I remembered and remembered loving: Robin Hood misenterpreting the gang's spoils as a gift for the poor, teaching the monster that stretching can help his bad back, little people and a small child hanging in cages over infinite blackness in the dungeon of Evil, and the final military confrontation with Evil in his weird red outfit and hat/helmet. Terry Gilliam has a way with fantasy and a way with humor not to be matched. Nothing that happens is ever expected, the humor's always a bit odd, and all the while the magic of the story and its varied fantastic settings leaves the viewer spellbound. ""Time Bandits"" is fun for kids and even more fun for twisted, cynical adults.
Follow ""Time Bandits"" with a quick hit of ""Brazil"" and then a viewing of ""The Adventures of Baron Munchausen."" Terry Gilliam calls the three his dream trilogy, and I must say that those three films are better than any trilogy that George Lucas has yet made or plans to make. The movies leave a person with the feeling of being in an off-center waking dream, and when the ending credits are reached the disappointment of losing that little fantasy world is palpable.

My copy is on my movie shelf right beside Brazil DVD, City of Lost Children DVD, Labrinth DVD, Dragonslayer VHS (come'on DVD!), and Gulliver's Travels DVD (with Ted Danson).  I'm a few years older than Craig Warnock who plays Kevin in the movie.
Now, the DVD presentation is definately a mixed bag.  The picture quality is quite good with an occational artifact or grainy look.  Many imperfections are probably on the original.  Not much you can do about that.  My PC-DVD player indicated that the movie was running in pan&scan.  Odd, this is supposed to be widescreen.  At first I thought that sound was top notch.  However, as I was watching it I noticed the sound seemed ""warped"".  It goes up and down constantly.  My old VHS copy had better sound.  This is a disappointment.  I'd give the picture a 4 out of five and the sound a 3 out of 5.  As for extras I enjoyed them all very much.  The commentary is great!  Craig Warnock (Kevin) is now much older.  It sounds like he had a great time making this movie.  There's a lot of fun inside info from Gilliam (the director).  I wish every movie I owned had commentary.  It's a great idea - all thanks to DVDs.
So...it you love this flick as much as many people reviewing do...go ahead and buy it.  Aside from the disappointing sound, everything else is as good as it'll get!  Time Bandits is even better than a 2-speed hedge cutter!!",983577600,11,1426,4.445736434108527
183052,5,1560689994,"I just bought this DVD and watched it tonight.  I first saw this in the theaters when I was about 7 years old or so and I remember it making a strong impression on me.  I've always been a huge fan of adventure/fantasy/scifi movies and Time Bandits may be one of the ultimate adventure movies.  With the band of international thieves, the kid Kevin travels throughout history and meets many luminaries, including a very cool John Cleese as Robin Hood.  For those who might be interested to know, Trevor Jones (movie composer) wrote a few musical pieces, and George Harrison wrote a really cool song that plays at the end credits.
I was really impressed with how good this movie looks even 15 years (or so) after it first was released.  Barring a few very dated special effects (most notably, the Supreme Being's floating head looks very much like a cartoon drawing in some scenes), this movie holds up very well and is very watchable (compare this to When Harry Met Sally, which visually looks very very dated).  The colors are bright, and the sets are unbelievable!  This movie is similar to The Adventures of Baron Munchausan, which is a fun, though not as good, movie by Gilliam.  The audio, on the other hand, is not in as good shape as the video.  At several parts in the movie, the audio becomes very ""bad"" and gives a slight ""buzzing"" type sound.  The score is pretty decent, not annoying or overly synthed.
As for the special features, this DVD doesn't really have alot of them, considering it's a Criterion Collection one.  However, it does have a kind of funny trailer, commentary by Gilliam, Michael Palin, Cleese, the guy who playe Kevin, and one other actor (one of the bandits I think).  I haven't listened to it but it should be interesting I would imagine.  The video scrapbook turned out to be pretty cool, much cooler than I expected.  It lasts about 3 minutes or so and shows snapshots of the actors and crew on the set and in costume.  It also shows a few storyboard sketches, but the real treat (kind of an easter egg in a way), is the very last picture which shows a picture taken in 1997 of Gilliam and the kid (now all grown up) who played Kevin!  That was really cool, and made me a little misty eyed.
All in all, I highly recommend this movie and this criterion edition DVD if you like fantasy or adventure movies.  It's simply one of the best!!",982368000,12,2370,4.5
183053,4,1560689994,"I am so glad to learn this film is now on DVD! And from CRITERION, no less! I have not seen the DVD version, yet, but I love the film. My only copy is dubbed to Hi8 from the rather crummy, cropped-to-fit Laserdisc a friend had, and I STILL watch it several times a year.
Criterion has always been my favorite Laserdisc production company, for their selection of eminently worthy, out-of-the-way classics; for the care with which they restore and transfer a print; and for the selection of ancillary materials they include (e.g., design sketches and viewing notes for Bladerunner). I'm sorry to learn they haven't done as well with the sound on Time Bandits as they might have.
But mostly, I want to comment on the film, itself. As my subject line says, I've never been a great fan of Monty Python. (Except in the animation department.) I like them okay, but seldom laugh aloud. And I HAVE always been a fan of select children's literature and film.  ...Just to acknowledge my overall perspective and biases.
First, I have to disagree with Pauline Kael's comment that Time Bandits ""may be one of those rare pictures that suffers from a surfeit of good ideas."" To my mind, Time Bandits sustains INFINITELY better proportion between story and ideas than does Brazil, which I thought inexcusably long, with some stretches practically barren.
Second, I really think it's the association with Python which has mitigated against Time Bandits having found a truer audience. This film has much more in common with Maurice Sendak's Where the Wild Things Are, and to some extent with Madeleine L'Engle's Wrinkle in Time or C. S. Lewis's Narnia Chronicles, than with the Python films I've seen. Its road-story format, unbounded by constraints of strictly linear travel, allows a much freer story form, travelling in and out of myth and [supposed] reality, gleefully both exploiting each for its story-telling strengths and clobbering its delicately exposed foibles.
Positing Palin and Duvall as historically reincarnated, circumstantially doomed lovers, first in the legendary era of Robin Hood, and later in the historically infamous [therefore perennially embroidered, and thus itself somewhat fabulistic] Titanic disaster, and in both cases having them be literally ""dropped in upon"" by Kevin and dwarves at the most romantically disastrous (okay, okay: NEARLY most disastrous) possible moments, is compact story-telling, plain and simple.
The film is commenting on the simultaneous futility and implacability of love and of fighting one's destiny; the role of sheer luck (via Kevin ALIGNED WITH dwarves) in first finding oneself in one's own, odd circumstances, and then in making the best of them; the ultimate stupidity of ALWAYS running off madly half-cocked in all directions OR of NEVER doing so (via Kevin VERSUS dwarves); and of the fluid boundaries between consensus ""reality"" and the imagination in which it is grounded--as when Kevin and Co. abandon the last floating bits of the hapless and [presumably] real Titanic, striking out into unknown waters, only to end up swimming seamlessly back into the realm of the fantastical.
I agree that the final battle is somewhat prolonged, but the weaving-in of all the toys from the initial, plot-reversal scene in Kevin's bedroom was a fine touch, I thought. So it required some time to do thoroughly--it no doubt enthralls those children old enough to appreciate delirious action, without being too frightened by it.
In addition, unlike some reviewers here, I found the ending rather satisfying. It neither pulled punches, nor sugar-coated what had gone before. Ultimate Evil is, after all, EVIL. REALLY evil, not just a little bit. And even in the face of evil, life is weird and funny and vexing and confusing and rough and joyous and... all the things life is. And not just a little bit. And NOT twits-in-a-sack-race-fall-down funny, like so much of the actual Python schtick. But oddly and wisely and dangerously and stupidly and sadly and infuriatingly and perplexingly funny. Like the look on Kevin's parents' faces when, dumb as their suburban lawn and just as devoid of wonder, they reach for the still-smoking, charred lump of meat which had caused their house to burn, and Kevin yells in horror, ""Mom! Dad! Don't touch it! It's EVIL!"" You know That Look they get? Just before they disobey the kid and suffer the consequences? THAT's the kind of odd-wise-dangerous-stupid-sad-infuriating-perplexing way life is funny.
And even though Kevin knows that, he's still stuck in it. And though he (and all of us) are stuck in it, the firefighter (bearing an uncanny resemblance to King Agamemnon, earlier in the story) is there to point out that the echoes of heroes and legends (and the rather more mundane reality-seeds from which they have always sprung) are all around us. Kevin, although perhaps unwittingly, knows that, too.
And now, so do you.
Watch the movie with a kid (or just with an attitude like one). Suspend disbelief. Have a lot of fun. Learn something. (From the kid--with you, or within you.)
Four stars.

183056,4,1560689994,"As one would expect of a Criterion release, the DVD of ""Time Bandits"" is an absolute pleasure, from the clean film transfer to the many delightful added features.
The production scrapbook is a treasure,  along with the commentary by Gilliam and Palin.  These features truly  enrich one's appreciation for the film; not only do they lavish praise on  the actors playing the ""dwarves"" (who, in retrospect, did nothing  less than a heroic job), but also reveal many of the clever tricks that  allowed them to create such a sumptuously beautiful film for the cost of  Speilberg's monthly catering bill.  Compare this film to expensive clunkers  like ""Tron"" (which came out a year later!) to appreciate the  extent of Gilliam's craft. Cleese's description of his day's work is  howlingly funny, and David Warner is generous and wryly amusing.  The  now-grown Craig Warnock is not particularly eloquent, however, and it's  hard to tell if he's joking about the film scarring him  psychologically!
The trailer is simply awful, after a promising start,  but it's indicative of AVCO's cluelessness about how to market such a fresh  and original film.  They tried to pass it off as Python style comedy, safe  for kiddies and fun for grow-ups.  In fact, it's nothing of the kind - it's  a dangerous and rigorous film that one may wish to keep out of the hands of  small children.
Despite it's vague resemblance to ""The Wizard of  Oz"" told upside down (or inside out?), ""Time Bandits"" is not  a typical (modern) children's film.  It has an old-fashioned Grimm-ness,  with creatures dying nasty, sweaty deaths and even ""good""  characters behaving quite badly at times.  In short, it is more utterly  honest than any fantasy film made since Disney bowdlerized ""Snow  White.""
Understanding that young people like to be frightened, and  taking peculiar delight in how ""awful"" his band of dwarf thieves  are, Gilliam places a very real boy (so real, he's almost dull) in an  amazing series of situations, exposing him to terrible ordeals with only a  shifty gang of unreliable and occasionally stupid companions to guide and  protect him - though mostly they ignore him or egg him on to be more like  them (being dwarves, he towers over them, both physically and morally).  At  the very moment he feels he's found the right place to be, they tear him  away with no regard for his wishes or feelings, and ultimately thrust him  into conflict with forces neither he nor they can comprehend, let alone  master.
Sounds a bit like growing up, doesn't it?
Along the way,  Gilliam tweaks various legendary Great and Powerful Figures (Napoleon,  Agamemnon, Robin Hood - even Satan [referred to exclusively as ""The  Evil Genius""]), not to mention technology and consumerism, to reveal  the narrow-minded, clumsy, grasping people we grown-ups really are.
The  ending remains controversial, although I can remember seeing it in my late  teens and feeling utterly liberated by it (what teenage boy doesn't want  his parents to evaporate, at least once in a while?).  There's more honesty  and meaning in the last five minutes than any patently false ""happy  ending"" could hope to achieve, although young children conditioned to  expect Pocahontas to live happily ever after with John Smith (which, of  course, she didn't) may find it too disturbing.
""Time Bandits""  is a triumphant use of fantasy to articulate truth, of the power of the  imagination to find the reality hidden in plain sight (the figures in the  final conflict can all be found in the boy's room in the early scenes).  It's an unforgettable film, with images and characters that will stay with  you for a lifetime, even if you aren't an impressionable, disaffected,  precocious brat (like I was when I first saw it), but especially if you  are!",960854400,71,3783,4.9393939393939394
183057,4,1560689994,"Worth it for Gilliam and indie film fans. A group of renegade  shrubbery-designers on the lam from the Supreme Being stumble through a  hole in space-time into the bedroom of a small boy, whom they abduct to  help them steal the treasures of history. Okay, Gilliam fans, rejoice.  Python fans, rent it first. Indie filmmakers - here's how to make a  plausible looking fantasy film on a (still big) budget. The executive  summary: 1. Acting - well done and believable. Appropriately over-the top  in places. 2. Plot - fun fun fun and I want that map! Touching in places,  and the non-Hollywood ending is perfect. 3. Production design / special  effects - good enough.  On par with Monty Python episodes / Holy Grail  film.  Notable exception - everything to do with ""Evil"". Bonus:  see the origins of the ""insidiously cheesy machinery"" look  Gilliam later perfected in ""Brazil"" and ""12 Monkeys"".  Sets and props are extremely well-used (pay attention to the kids' room at  the beginning!)and add richness to the film.  The DVD has commentary by the  now-grown child lead, as well as some Gilliam miscellany.  For fans, well  worth the extra investment, even if you already own the VHS edition. Key  issue - this is only a date movie if your date can handle  ""silly."" Most American ladies (in my experience) find Monty  Python really unfunny. This film is not true Python when taken as a whole,  but anything with a little slapstick and cockney accents seems to get  painted as such. Warning: I thought that since one lady friend of mine  liked Adam Sandler, she'd like TB - I was wrong! Be warned! Overall - fans,  buy it.  Others - rent it or ask for it for a gift.",959212800,,1665,4.6482758620689655
183058,5,1560689994,"This film is entirely entertaining and has a true magic to it which is sadly gone from the films of the 90's.  It is, as a work of fantasy, the most engaging and rewarding cinema experience since the days of Jason and  the Argonauts.  It challenges you to conceive of the incredible imagery  presented and also to think as two halves of yourself at once; your simpler  yet more life-affirming youth, and your complex, more discriminate  adulthood.
I refer to this film as Chapter One in the sense that it was  the first of Gilliam's three films which deal with the concepts of fantasy  and reality.  Time Bandits involves a young boy who escapes his parents  through his fantasies.  Brazil, by far my favorite film of all time, is the  second film, dealing with a man escaping harsh reality by his dreams.  The  final installment is the highly underrated Adventures of Baron Munchaussen,  which is about an older man indulging the fantasic reality of his youth to  fight off his impending end.",958608000,4,993,4.686046511627907
183059,3,1560689994,"Great ideas, superb cinematography but average movie. Terry Gilliam's TIME BANDITS is the perfect example of the - could have been the best - movie. While I watched this DVD, I couldn't help myself to think : why but why am  I not excited by such delirious images ?
TIME BANDITS isn't a child's  dream. Even if Kevin's adventures seem to emerge from the books he has  read. Gulliver, the Minotaur, the Trojan wars, Napoleon, Robin Hood are  familiar figures to a boy always lost in his imaginary world. But their  appearance in TIME BANDITS let me a bit puzzled. One can hardly say that  these figures are observed from the point of view of a 10 years old child.  The presence of the caustic mind of Terry Gilliam is too obvious.
TIME  BANDITS isn't a dream but a nightmare. By inverting the structure of Victor  Fleming's THE WIZARD OF OZ, Terry Gilliam creates a certain uneasiness in  the audience ; in TIME BANDITS, Dorothy (Kevin) isn't searching the Wizard  (the Supreme Being) but tries to escape him. More intriguing, Kevin meets  the characters appearing in his adventures AFTER the dream ! Furthermore,  the final minutes of TIME BANDITS are worthy to appear in a FRIDAY THE 13TH  or FREDDY sequel.
Great ideas but average movie because TIME BANDITS, too  often, is nothing more than brilliant sequences put one after the other  without any plot line. That is the main reason why I cannot be enthusiastic  about TIME BANDITS : The Terry Gilliam of the Monty Python is still alive  in this movie with his TV tricks, private jokes and bad habits. But the  creator of BRAZIL has already awaken.

All you need to hear is the Evil ones fascination with computers to realize that Gilliam shows amazing insight  and genius with his effort. This movie, however, is not necessarily going  to thrill those looking for Monty Pythons follow up to the Meaning of Life,  also not for those just out to see Sean Connery. See it because you love  Gilliams other movies, or see it because you love a good adventure through  Time and Space. Truly inspired...",950054400,4,559,4.606060606060606
183065,3,1560689994,"I watched this movie (for some obscure reason) in a Cinema History class, and was amused if somewhat disappointed. Expecting something slightly more ""pythonesque"", considering that Monty Python members Michael  Palin and Terry Gilliam wrote the screenplay, I was a little surprised by  the style of the film, and the plot: the proper young British boy and the  gang of over-enthusiastic dwarves travelling the universe in search of  adventure, fleeing from the supreme being who would take away their means  of amusement.
Still, as long as a movie makes me smile, I'm happy, and I  must admit I got a couple of laughs out of ""Time Bandits"".  Some high points in the movie included the all too brief scene with John  Cleese as Robin Hood (""And how long have you been a robber? Jolly good  . . .""), which lasted about three minutes - odd, considering that  Cleese's name was listed first amongst the credits.  Sean Connery's bit  was also one of the more interesting parts, as well as the Michael Palin  scenes - which I have yet to comprehend the meaning of, but which were  amusing all the same.  ""Time Bandits"" is one of the stranger  movies I have seen, aimed at a younger audience than the Monty Python  movies, but also dealing with issues above that, and an interesting movie  for most people. Unfortunatly, its ending is worse even than the sudden  blotting of the camera screen, as in ""Monty Python and the Holy  Grail,"" which may have been the cause of some of the more unkind  reviews. When you realise that it's the end of the movie, you're left  completely hanging, and half the appreciation drops away with the ground.  Still, it's an interesting movie, and fun for most.",947289600,15,1683,4.688356164383562

Gilliam has the rare gift of sublimely and gently  exposing weaknesses in the human character through outlandish comedic  situations. Ostensibly this is a children's story, a fairy tale of sorts,  but it has quite a bit to offer adults as well.

183068,4,1560689994,"Like the Princess Bride (and perhaps as a precursor to the ""Scream""/horror phenomenon), Time Bandits is an honest homage to  its genre, while at the same time being very aware of itself.  This film is  LOADED with imagination, magic, special effects, and great character  vignettes.  And it's also a great history lesson.
Despite the fact that  it's a Gilliam/Palin collaboration, it's not Monty Python (with the  possible exception of the Robin Hood bit - worth the price of the film  alone), but once you get past the expectation that it will be  side-splittingly funny, you can easily get carried away with this  tale.
If you get the Criterion DVD do what I did and devote an entire  weekend to it:  Watch the film, then listen to the commentary, which will  make you want to watch the film again.
Take heed though of the quality  warnings:  I thought the picture was wonderful (as every other video  version around seems to be in rough shape), but the sound is lacking in  parts.  Those downfalls and the overblown ending climax (I know it's an  epic battle of good vs. evil, but it's still too long!) are what cost this  film all 5 stars.",940896000,70,1143,4.62

This does not do the film justice in any way.  The  transfer is riddled with artifacts from a presumably aged master, and the  sound has distinctly noticeable dips, much like turning the volume knob  quickly.  This is painfully evident in George Harrison's song that plays  over the end credits; that song is on no other CD I've seen, which is a  shame because it's a very Beatles-y tune.  I'm suprised Criterion let this  out.  My DVD of Dolemite from Image Entertainment is of comparable quality,  and their production budget is generally pretty low compared to  Criterion's.
