3830686,4,B0020TS5EM,"I have all the seasons of The Shield, and it's one heck of a show. It's got everything; intensity, humor, great acting, and it's very well written. I'm sad to see it go off the air, but then again, it's probably for the best. Most shows that go on for near or over a decade tend to get stale anyway. I have not yet watched any of the series finale, but I did watch the final episode. So I'm anxiously awaiting for this to come out on DVD. Oh, Vic Mackey, I hardly knew thee, but you'll live on in my DVD player.",1241913600,2,511,3.970873786407767
3830687,5,B0020TS5EM,"But, now I'm going through withdrawal. The Shield is over. The Wire is over. And, I can't find anything satisfying to watch. What's a poor guy to do?",1241740800,3,149,4.357142857142857
3830688,5,B0020TS5EM,"Warning, spoilers ahead:

In the seventh, and final, season of FX's The Shield, everyone gets just about what they deserve to one degree or another.  Whether it be crooked cop Vic Mackey (Michael Chiklis), who is working overtime to save himself along with working every angle and playing every side he can in the process, or his ex-partner Shane (Walton Goggins), whose plan to take out Vic and Ronnie (David Rees Snell) goes awry, and when he is discovered, amounts to one of the absolute best scenes and moments in the show's entire history as he goes on the run with his pregnant wife Mara (Michele Hicks).  In between all that, Vic's shaky alliance with Aceveda (Benito Martinez) hits a bump as he plays the Armenians, Mexicans, Salvadorans, and the Feds all against each other, as well as seeking immunity with the help of a shady agent (Laurie Holden), which leads to a powerful moment of Vic's admition of all the things he's done over the years in the season's penultimate episode.  Everything truly does come together as the episodes wind down to the end, and everyone gets what they deserve in the process.  There's some sub-plots abound that include Claudette's (CCH Pounder) failing health rearing its ugly head again, Dutch's (Jay Karnes) investigation of a possible up and coming serial killer, Dani's (Catherine Dent) attempting to keep her son out of Vic's reach, and Corrine's (Cathy Cahlin Ryan) betrayal of Vic.  Throughout the season, Chiklis is at his top form, and is more magnetic to watch here than ever before.  That being said, The Shield as a whole has earned its spot as being a groundbreaking crime drama, and in retrospect, the show comes to a more than fitting end as well.",1240099200,35,1705,4.798634812286689
3830689,5,B0020TS5EM,"The Shield's final season is uncompromising as old ghosts continue to complicate lives in farmington. Every moment of this season remains focused on the impending end, and long time viewers are rewarded as the major plot points come to a head and pay off. This was not a quickie rush job to end the story, every member of the cast moves with deliberate and in some cases desperate urgency.
 The season is topped off by one of the most satsifying endings I have seen in a television show. It's a credit to the writers and actors involved that I can pity a character I despised an episode earlier, or that a complex character like Vic Mackey can charm his way through a horrific dialogue.
 If you've been watching the Shield, don't miss the final season.",1239840000,26,752,4.562962962962963
3830690,4,B0020TS5EM,"This season nicely ties up storylines and loose ends from both season 6 and prior seasons. The concluding episode is a satisfying end to the series as Vic gets pretty much what he deserves from his actions during the prior seasons from his coworkers and family. Since I'm writing this review before the DVD release, I'm giving a rating of 4 stars. The show is 5 stars and I hope the extras on the DVD are consistent with the extras found on Seasons 1 through 6 which included episode commentaries, behind the scene features and deleted scenes with commentaries (purchase them too if you haven't already, so watching Season 7 makes sense)",1238716800,9,637,4.696428571428571

3830704,5,B0020TS5EM,"It's been nearly a week since I finished viewing all of the episodes of The Shield. As I have written in another earlier review The Shield represents all of the foibles that have plagued mankind since the beginning of civilization. The lead character Vic is a wild beast uncontrolled by society's restrictions and will do anything, repeat anything, to protect his turf and family. All of the characters in the story are familiar to all of us; Cops in LA supposedly keeping the streets safe by arresting the guilty felonious criminals from The Hood and the cross-boarder cartel members infiltrating our country. No character in the story is likeable. All of them are corrupt and have an irrational hatred for anybody who breaks a rule while they themselves break all the rules. The police are accurately portrayed as small minded brutes who shoot innocent people on the street, break into homes and trash the contents. They take the innocent and the guilty to the police station and beat confessions out of them. This was a warning to us, but, we didn't listen and now we have police all over the U.S. who act like this and sometimes worse.",1458000000,,1139,4.757575757575758

3830708,2,B0020TS5EM,"If you like cop dramas dripping with testosterone and mindless, rock 'em sock 'em early 00's rap metal in the soundtrack, this is your show!  I made the mistake of binge-watching this show AFTER having seen The Wire multiple times, and The Shield is like...1980s claymation, or a child's puppet show in comparison.  It's one of those shows where it's not greater than the sum of its parts.  What I mean by that is there are GREAT actors and great storylines, but it just doesn't add up to what it could have been.  Not to spoil anything, but there are several plotlines that don't go anywhere and feel tacked-on for shock value, a few things never get resolved (or get a stupid, rushed resolution), and some of the coolest angles never develop.  It was on Amazon Prime instant video, which is how I watched all but the series finale, but I wouldn't go out of my way to watch it again.

To end on a positive note I will say this.  If you like all those guys from Sons of Anarchy, and Justified... a lot of them show up on this show (I'm told).  And before I saw this I'd never heard of Michael Chiklis, which was terribly unfortunate.  I'm eternally grateful watching this show remedied that, at least.",1451779200,,1201,4.447488584474886
3830709,5,B0020TS5EM,I use to look forward to watching the Shield each week and since it is not on any reruns on any channel it is great to watch it again.,1450051200,,134,3.6551724137931036
3830710,3,B0020TS5EM,"I had seen Seasons 1 to 6 here in NZ but could not get 7 so it cost me about $46.00 to have it posted by Amazon.
I have just got into disc 1 and 2.
All the other discs from Season 1 are sub-titled and these are not so I cannot make out much of what is being said.
The accent and dialogue is so 'gangsta' that without the words it is a bit much to try to absorb.
Also the action moves so fast that subs are definately needed.
Another thing is on the discs themselves there are no numbers to define Disc 1-2 or others so it is another small but frustrating thing in fact I just can't see how stupid the designers were to leave the numbers out.
I bought most of the series here for $5 per disc so that is real value compared to the final one.",1447113600,,739,3.8366013071895426

Would've been nice to know that going into the series.  I'm not a new Prime member, but am new to Prime TV.  As a new Prime TV customer, I'm not nearly as thrilled now.

3830795,3,B0020TS5EM,"Lots of fast moving excitement.  However, most dramas allow the audience to identify with at least one leading character.  Sadly, the main characters are for the most part either flawed - Vic and the Strike Team - or just totally goofy - ie Dutch Boy, or pure weasel - David.  The ending is perfect.  A pitiful, broken, useless man in his worst nightmare, having accomplished nothing for all his massive effort, only leaving corpses and ruined lives.  A person who, with far less stress and effort, could have left a great and positive legacy.

In a word, depressing.

The entire final season more than met the expectations. Like any good series, the focus narrows to the characters in whom we have the most invested:  Corrine, Wyms, Shane, Aceveda, and of course Vic.  The Vendrell family arc was masterfully done, and took me by surprise in terms of both depth and outcome.  The final ending for Vic is worthy of the series, the character and the actor.  Chiklis earned the accolades he received.  In my opinion, this was either tied for the best season or it was the second-best season behind  Lt. Kavanaugh's season 5.",1415059200,,727,4.722222222222222

A dirty politician who causes the murder of a criminal who could blackmail him OR a cop who shoots another rat cop to protect his interests.  What a choice!  If one has to choose, I choose the politician ex-cop as the worst scum - Aceveda needed to be exposed at a minimum.  Mackey's personal devastation was not enough and you are left with - this guy survives to do some good later and likely a little more bad... Does one justify the other?  If I had to choose between these two - I would choose Mackey.  There's not much slimier than a politician.  Yes, in the end, they ARE all the same as they all have to compromise anything and everything to get where they are...  reality isn't always pretty.

3830930,5,B0020TS5EM,"Up until the last 2 part episode of The Shield in this its final season, I hadn't quite made up my mind on this series, concentrating on a special police ""strike team"" fighting gang related activity. As must be expected in a series of this length, there were some outstanding shows and others which didn't measure up.  But the acting was uniformly excellent, and the shows were fast paced to keep the viewer's interest.

The continuous reliance on commando police tactics was clearly over the top, yet the presentation of political conflicts was thought provoking, as we continually face the real life truths that many neighborhoods in our cities are out of control.  (Why, for example, should Chicago and Baltimore have several times the murder rates of New York, except for political ineptitude?)  Simply ""locking up the bad guys"" was shown to be naive when the viewer was presented with scenarios which call for decisions on whom to lock up first - the visible underlings or their bosses, who are progressively more insulated the higher up you go.  And how far do you go when pressuring snared lawbreakers to give up their bosses?

Also, how would cops deal with temptation to begin taking some of that easy money, to abuse the power they have over criminals to steal from and even rape them at will?  No easy answers are shown - some cops are presented as super straight arrows, others as more than willing to use their office criminally, justifying their actions as part payment for disrupting major criminal operations.  And these two extremes are observed against a background of ordinary cop Joes and Janes, sometimes successful at their jobs; sometimes making big mistakes.

One of the more refreshing aspects of the show was that it didn't use its hard bitten police action as a platform to spout the typical anti-gun propaganda larded into NYPD Blue, which trotted out dozens of theoretical evils inherent in allowing citizens to own their own firearms, without ever once showing a positive result.  The Shield simply ignored the entire civilian ownership of guns issue and concentrated on its main storyline.

 (SPOILER ALERT).  Throughout the series, there were strong and weak points, but the ending, presented as a type of Greek tragedy for the main characters, caused me to give this series a 5 star rating.",1408406400,,2323,4.910485933503836

Season 7 is probably the most sad because of the way it ended for Michael Chiklis and Walton Goggins. I wish they could have filmed an alternate ending where Vendrell gives himself up along with his family and Vic Mackie gets reunited with his family again and all of them go into a Witness Protection Program.

The continued trend of ....pregnantfemaleladycop (can't recall name) and gayblackdudecop (name also escapes me at the moment) being criminally underused / completely forgettable continued this season, and Claudette continued to be the far and a way worst character ever conceived - but still a great show.

A superb cast backs him up including Cathy Cahlin Ryan (wife of series creator, executive producer and writer, Shawn Ryan), Autumn Chiklis (daughter of Michael), Katherine Dent, Walton Goggins (Justified) but most of all, CCH Pounder as Detective Claudette Wyms (Warehouse 13 and Sons of Anarchy) and teammate Jay Karnes as Detective Holland ""Dutch"" Wagenbach (Sons of Anarchy).

Shaky photography, at first kind of disconcerting, gives the viewer the feeling of running along with the group. Outstanding ""street"" dialog and writing make this a must see series.

Lots of good cop, bad cop, and some perceived reality of the pressures that police work under politically, budget wise, and in the field. Plenty of use of socioeconomic conditions and how they might affect crime and the quality of life in the precinct. Different from cutesy and humorous whodunit detective shows, even those with mild to full violence, as this shows the police fighting back using the criminals own tactics, and a little self-interest that comes from being underpaid and overworked when temptation overcomes their core values.

Really sad story. Vic was one of those guys you wanted to see him make it but my god the horrible s*** he and his gang did. Great cast. Claudette's story with Dutch was like an alter protagonist. Beautiful sad stories. A dirty world with what could be unsympathetic characters. I knew the world was going to go very bad for them when Lem got taken out. The ending was really painful. Even tho Shane and his wife drove me nuts sometimes it really hurt to see what happened to them. Ronnie who was the most solid of Vic's guys and always as cool as a cucumber wound up the only one to to really pay the price that they all wanted to avoid although Vic's punishment was poetic - a 9 to 5 desk job.

This is becauise he is  not amoral. He has a specific set of loyalty-driven rules and he abides by them.
The last episode was one of ther finest wrtten closures I have seen. There I no ""pat"" ending, just results that fit each character.

3831045,5,B0020TS5EM,"I love the actors, characters, and writing on this show. The most striking thing about this show is that I hated each character at least once during the series. When does that EVER happen on television? Goofy, affable Dutch murders a cat just to see what it's like? Incredible. It really bothered me to watch that and then, a few episodes later, I'm loving watching his storylines and laughing at his oddness.

I had to question why I was rooting for such an evil, selfish, nutburger of a guy (Mackie), literally until the last second of the series. In the last nine minutes of the series, I was fantasizing that he'd break Gardocki out of prison and both of them run to Mexico and then run away from each other forever because I didn't want to see Mackie give up everything he was and sit at a computer with nothing but photos of his kids for the rest of his life. I knew there would be no prison breakout scene.

I hoped he was going to plant a bomb or something in the office building and as it blew up, we'd watch him walk away with a big smile on his face and tossing his tie aside. But thank god, none of that happened. Instead we watch Mackie seeming to just glimpse everything he'd done and everything he'd lost and then take a breath and move on with his own life because in the end, that's the most important thing to him. Stunning writing, I cannot believe it was ever allowed on America television. Just wow. :)",1393459200,,1423,4.325842696629214

3831047,5,B0020TS5EM,"Warning: minor spoilers ahead

Ok, so I just finished watching all 7 seasons of The Shield.  It took about two months.  I watched the last three episodes about two hours ago.

Let me tell you what I think.... and bear in mind, this is a post- ""Breaking Bad"" review.  The Shield is the best non-premium cable show of all time.  Yes, I said it.  It's better than ""Breaking Bad"" or ""Mad Men"" or any of the other lame series you think are ""amazing"".  I'll go one step further... it's better than The Sopranos.  How's that taste?

Let me clarify.  I've seen 'em all.  Homeland. The Sopranos.  Dexter. Breaking Bad. Deadwood. The Wire.  Luther.  Whitechapel. The list goes on.  Any gritty cop drama ever conceived, I've seen it.  The Shield ranks #2 on my list all-time, just behind Deadwood (imho, the greatest,most  under-appreciated series of all time).

The final episode is such a sweet payoff.  In fact, the final 20 seconds of the last episode will have you pumping your fist and hating yourself for doing it at the same time.  I'm a pretty hard dude, but the last scene with Mackey and Whims in Interrogation #1 made me weep openly.  Breaking Bad didn't do that to me.  The Sopranos didn't do that to me.

Bottom line: this show does not get the credit it deserves.  Look at the timeline of modern cop drama on TV.  The Shield broke every mold and paved the way for everything after.  It managed to blow out an unbreakable envelope without the benefit of the ""anything goes"" premium cable (HBO/Showtime/Starz) wiggle room.

My favorite characters from episode 1 to the finale were Dutch and Whims.  It was gratifying to see how they developed and were vindicated as some of the few real and just humans in the series.  Mackey was the ultimate anti-hero.  Even more so than Walter White of Breaking Bad, imho.  Even after it's all said and done, I don't know where I stand with his character.  Do I love him?  Do I loathe him?  I don't know, and may never decide.  That's a testament to the writing of this series.  Hey, you ""Breaking Bad"" fans... it's been done before.  It's called ""The Shield.""

What an epic show.  The Shield gives just enough meat to help the viewer suspend disbelief, while at the same time delivering drama and a cliff-hanger at the end of nearly every episode.  That's basically perfect TV in my book.",1393286400,,2327,4.564476885644769

Some of the scenes are gruesome however quickly they move away from them, the reality in which they are depicted is incredible.

The things Macky has to realize and live with at the end are so profound that it leaves you speechless even during the rolling of the credits.  I wish they made a movie.

3831110,5,B0020TS5EM,"This last season kept me on the edge of my seat! I enjoyed ALL the seasons.. Some more than others.  However, season 7 blew everything out of the water.

You don't know WHO is going to get who. I found myself feeling sorry for Shane's wife. Before season 7 I just kept wishing she'd go away!

I also found myself going back and forth between ""team Vic/team Shane"" who do you want coming out on top? Who is going to outsmart the other!!

Best season ever and I have to wonder EHY in the world did they end the season??? Same as Dexter?? Why end a hit???",1386806400,,552,4.130841121495327

3831136,5,B0020TS5EM,"My wife and I have watched all 7 seasons of The Shield streaming it from amazon and I must say that I enjoy the flexibility of being able to watch the show on my own schedule and without commercials.  For examples, we would sometimes watch 2 episodes a night and several episodes in a single week.

On to season 7, I have to say that I actually liked Vic on the show because even though he broke the rules at times I believed that he thought he was doing the right thing by putting the really bad criminals away.  However, it become apparent that by the end that he became totally corrupt.  The last straw for me was that he let Ronnie go down while he got immunity from the feds.  I never thought he would go that from, but in hindsight it was clear that he was on a long slippery slop to ruin.

I decided one evening to watch the first episode of The Shield and was hooked.  When I realized there were only 7 seasons, I knew I could swallow it up in a short time from start to finish.  This is a gritty, and mostly negative look at law enforcement.  But having family in the system, I know that it isn't an impossible stretch to believe this type of behavior happens.  Having said that, I couldn't stop watching hour after hour.  I wanted to, but I had to know what was going to happen next.  And then the end.  It could have taken parts of other cops lives and expanded on them but it just stopped.  It was like eating your favorite pie and just eating and eating until it was gone.  Then having this giant lump of food in your stomach that was going to take a long time to digest.  Good show.",1379808000,,957,4.135869565217392

I watched this particular season because I wanted to see the episodes Alex O'loughlin was in. He played a pretty insignificant part, and didn't make much of an impact as far as I could see.
This the only season I've watched, so I didn't know the story, but I don't feel like I needed to know the history. There are no heroes here; just cops who have done bad things and, when they try to stop, they just get themselves into more trouble. It's suspenseful, well-written and well-acted; however, it's filmed in that sort of hand-held camera style, which I  don't care for.

I do believe that there are places, pass and present where this is the way the real world works.  Very scary to think about. I feel sorry for the police that have to work in this type of environment and the people that are trapped in the same environment with no way out. The acting was wonderful. I must say I was pleased with the fact that Vic didn't end up winning, he was so wrong in so many ways as where many of the characters. Had they not given him a soften side on occasion and let us see his conflict I wouldn't have been able to watch it. Thanks to cable we are getting some wonderful TV series now.

3831171,5,B0020TS5EM,"I discovered this show a few weeks ago and consumed all 7 seasons in a disconcertingly short time.  I was hooked.  I found myself rooting for Vic and the strike team in spite of their very inconsistent moral compass.  (Perhaps in part because of it).  What started to bother me about midway through Season 5 was that the plot began to hinge around dumb moves by characters who knew better.  Corinne's alliance with Claudette was essential for story but not plausible.  The event construction around Lem getting busted for heroin possession was shaky at best.  Vic would never release his hold on Escoveda by giving up the last copy of the compromising photo.  Shane really wasn't dumb as a stump but acted so when it was convenient.  Writing staff chose (wrongly, IMO) to eschew the opportunity to follow up on Dutch's creepiness after he killed the cat.  On and on.  You might say, well dude, if writing is so easy, why don't you do it?  Well, I'm not a TV writer but I've published over 30 short stories and two novels, so I am speaking with a bit of hands-on craft knowledge. Thing is, in spite of some  flaws, I thought the show completely kicked ass.

The final season was a disappointment because I was hoping Mackie would get his just desserts. He really was a vile, despicable human being and I wanted him to be punished. I don't ever remember feeling such hatred for a character in any series. The actors were all wonderful, not a weak link in the lot.

3831191,5,B0020TS5EM,"I never tuned in while the show was airing, thinking it would not be of interest to me. I could not have been more wrong.  Several weeks ago, I decided to give it a try here on Amazon Prime. Within the first ten minutes I was hooked, and binge-watched whenever I could.  I have never seen TV characters more real or more flawed than a lot of these people. The Strike Team shows you how rogue they can go right from the beginning, so you no longer find yourself surprised when they do something heinous, whether it is justified or not. These are not Law & Order cops.  These are dirty cops who get the job done, and you find yourself rooting for them whether you want to or not. All seven seasons kept me riveted.  The final season was positively Shakespearean in its conclusion, particularly with regard to Ronnie. The ironies that pile up, one after, make it hard to completely like or dislike anyone, though Corinne did get on my nerves more than once. Dutch is a great character, a genius at psychological profiling. Billings is smarmy and funny. They could have done so much more with Danny, but Catherine Bent did what she could with the role.  CCH Pounder, long a favorite of mine, is mesmerizing as Claudette.  All of the guys on the Strike team were perfectly cast and each of them pulled his weight. Walton Goggins blew me away with his ability to make you both love and hate him, and you really come to like and understand Lem and Ronnie. The heart of the show, though, is Michael Chiklis.  His Vic Mackey is a complex good guy who is occasionally bad or bad guy who is occasionally good. His love for his family is not his driving force until the end, and then the end knocks you out as you watch the lengthy close-up of his face as he realizes what he has lost. Excellent. Perfect. Right up there with ""The Wire"" and ""Breaking Bad"" for me.  Will likely start again, just to pick up things I missed before.  Recommend.",1373932800,2,1929,4.396067415730337

3831193,5,B0020TS5EM,I really enjoyed this series. I was drawn into the story more and more as each season progressed.  The final season was well done and I was left in dismay.

3831194,3,B0020TS5EM,"Trying to tie everything up in a final season is difficult for shows of this nature. You've got years of back-story coming into play all in a very short period of time and unfortunately The Shield falls victim to feeling rushed - very rushed towards the end. Not only that by the end most of the characters become so unlike-able you wonder how you managed to follow them this long in the first place.

3831197,4,B0020TS5EM,"I loved this series and for the most part the final season played out pretty much as it had to but unlike most people who have reviewed this final season, I felt somewhere along the line the ball was dropped as to whom Vic Mackey really was. Shane did just what I would have expected from knowing the character that he was but to me, Vic left unfinished business and that just was not Vic. As many faults as his character had, I always understood where he was coming from and saw the integrity in his character but the way he left it with Ronnie left me totally unsatisfied. I can imagine what I feel should happen with Vic in the future but he had a job to do with Ronnie and he didn't deliver. I don't want to ruin the show for those who haven't seen it but I had an idea of what should have gone down in the final episode and when it didn't happen, there was no closure for two of the characters. Still, one of the best shows ever put together and I bought every season and will absolutely watch them more than once.

By the end of the first season, it becomes a bit more obvious where he stands on the paragon scale of good and evil. By the end of this season, he gets so far gone it's just a bit too much. The ending, while not entirely anti-climactic, does leave a little too much to be desired. All in all, it wasn't horrible by any means, but it wasn't great either.",1373328000,,443,4.349397590361446

This season was good, but not great. Maybe because it seems that they tried to stuff so much into it over 13 episodes. The themes for this season were: Shane vs. Vic & Ronnie, Vic's forced retirement coming up, Vic racing against the clock to get he and Ronnie jobs with ICE, Claudette's illness getting worse, Dutch taking interest in a young guy that could possibly become a serial killer, Aceveda running for mayor, Vic trying to get to the Mexican cartel, and Vic & Shane's wives and families and how different their lives are in relation to their husband/father.

It's definitely a must see. The payoff is of course seeing what happens to everyone in the end and seeing if they get what they deserve. Over the top, yeah, but probably one of the best and most appropriate finales you'll see.",1371254400,,906,4.552147239263804

The writing is fantastic, as is the casting. Everybody on the show seems totally believable, not like on most tv shows being made today where every female character looks like supermodels instead of real people. With the exception of cable shows like Breaking Bad or Game of Thrones, today's tv is mostly mediocre, aimed at the lowest common denominator. The Shield is like a breath of fresh air that you can't get enough of after smelling fumes all day that is network tv today. I just finished watching the last episode of the series, and I must say, I've already missed it intensely. I wished I could see what happens to these characters for a little while longer.

Meanwhile, kudos for the incredibly good scripts, casting, acting, direction and guts to take on some of the street action without any varnish. The intensity from Chiklish and Pounder was phenomenal. and the gray-area moral dilemmas and shades of rare subtlety. Better than The Wire, better than Breaking Bad.

Welcome to Shawn Ryan's ""The Shield"", where the line between good and evil isn't just blurred, it's been completely erased. Solid casting (Chiklis, Pounder, Karnes, Goggins, Johnson, Martinez et al) and a gritty urban soundtrack lend realism to what seems like a far-fetched premise: that a group of cops are only scooping up drugs and laundered money to redistribute it in huge volumes. Loosely based on the ""Rampart"" case in LA, this story strains credibility but it's a wild, fun ride in an unmarked cop car.

Many people have compared the Shield to Shakespeare's Macbeth and Richard the Third.  It has also been said, that unlike most television Dramas, the Shield, in its entirety, has a three act structure. Two key events happen - during seasons five, and seven, respectively - in the lives of the characters that completely change the dynamic of the show.

I'd have to choose the final season as my favorite, and I also consider the series finale to be the best season finale I've ever seen.  You must watch this show all the way to the final episode.  If you were to stop short of the end, you really would not understand it completely.  Everything that happens in these characters' lives culminates in the final few episodes.

Two days ago, I watched the final episode again.  I've watched the entire series, front to back, twice already, so nothing that happens in the story comes as a surprise anymore.  Despite this fact, when the episode finished, I just sat there, overwhelmed, and almost in shock.

3831300,5,B0020TS5EM,"The Shield is a dark, gritty, violent tv show based on corruption within a police department's special unit and the interweaving of the lives of several key characters in the department.

The Seventh and ""Final Act"" season of the Shield wraps up the show's amazing story with some great resolution and goes out with a bang, unlike most television shows, sadly.

Incredible acting, special effects, and dialogue make this show one of my favorites and this epic conclusion left me satisfied that the show ended on such a high note and wrapped up all loose ends.",1311552000,,559,4.8125
3831301,5,B0020TS5EM,"Wow, this show...  Thank God for Amazon, a place where you can come to unwind the turmoil that shows like this leave you in once you're finished.  The Shield stands among those epic acheivements of television in the new millenium like The Wire or The Sopranos.  In two words.. riveting television.  Other riveting shows, not necessarily of the same genre would include Breaking Bad (the first 2 seasons at least), 6 Feet Under, Damages, Rome, The Good Wife, and Californication.  It's amazing what the turn of the millenium has produced, mostly for pay TV, HBO and Showtime.  With this show ""The Shield"", FX established themselves.

But what of the show? * * SPOILERS * * It somehow managed to outdo itself time after time and season after season.  Weakest of the bunch, in my opinion would have been the season which takes up with Forest Whitaker as Det. John Kavanaugh.  He was pretty over-the-top I thought especially in the beginning.  If anyone ever looked psycho in this show it was him - a bit much for a guy playing a cop.  The thing that bugged most was that Whitaker just seemed to be playing the same character he always plays, e.g. ""The Crying Game"", etc.  If there was a lull in the series, it was during his tenure.  Especially after following up Glenn Close from the previous season.  She was great.

But I'm digressing, because this is supposed to be about the end of the show and not the middle.  If there were ever any bones I had to pick about The Shield it would be the occasional (but perhaps necessary) convenient illogical choices made by characters along the way. And come to think of it, those illogical decisions were made by Mackey in every incident I can think of.  The first: Mackey's threat to kill Shane after he discovers Shane has killed Lem.  Had Lem testified about the money train in order to get locked up in some prison away from Antwon Mitchell, the whole strike team would have been brought down.  Shane simply acted with the same intelligence any other mobster would have, probably the second biggest negative defining point of the strike team's players after the killing of the would-be informant cop they offed in season 1.  Vic could not accept that, but the reality of the situation is that with Lem not accepting a trip to Mexico and his mind already set on giving up his part in the money train, Shane's action in effect kept the whole group out of jail (and kept the series going!).  Nothing contrived thus far, but Vic's final inability to forgive Shane that, and vowing to kill him even, sets what's left of the group in turmoil and Shane back to his own devices.  I kind of didn't beleive Vic would be so stupid as to not seeing the unpleasant logic of what Shane had done.  Shane calls Vic a hypocrite at one point and he's right.  He basically saved him (again, in true gangster logic) from doing what needed to be done.  Of course the war that this sparks off between them is good fodder for following seasons.  Which brings us to Season 7.

A few more things I didn't quite buy.  Vic agrees to give Aceveda a key to the locker in which they are storing the little black box with dirt on all the higher ups that Vic found.  Why would he do that, knowing his always precarious relationship with Aceveda?  Later Vic gives over his file with dirt on the ICE agent to that same agent (they are working together).  He gives her the file before making his deal - again, why would he do that?  If not for convenience to the developing plot line, I don't think Mackey would have been so soft-headed and incapable of seeing his loss of bartering position.

Then there is the issue of over-stupid criminals that always agree to go with Mackey's plans (and that always end up with them on ICE's plate).  You could argue that Mackey is truly corrupt enough for it not to seem so completely illogical.  So I will suspend disbeleif.

And this brings up another good topic: Mackey's corruption.  In spite of his undeniable crimes, there is a reason most people who watch this show end up routing for Mackey in spite of themselves, and that is that he has as many good qualities as he has criminal tendencies in his career.  Let us also not forget that while his greatest and most unforgivable crime was the killing of an investigating officer, at the same time it is undeniable that Mackey's mere presence on the street largely results in the saving of many lives time and time again.  Many more lives than the one he took in fact. There is no black and white about Vic - he's a lovely shade of grey.  And though he is certainly that grey character, your underlying feeling is that the man is basically decent.  There is no denying that Vic under normal circumstances (and even under incredibly un-normal circumstances) is a loyal, if not father-like figure, to his people on the strike team offering undying and unflagging support.  And not only to them but to his divorced wife and children as well.  The general feeling you get about Vic most of the time is that the man cares about his people.  This makes the ending where he winds up making a deal to get his traitorous wife off the hook instead of his truly loyal friend Ronnie Gardocky one of the great tragedies of the last season.  If the ship is sinking do you save your wife, who is mother of your three children, or your best friend?  Ronnie was really one of my favorite characters in this show. Quiet, behind the scenes, and reliable.  It was beyond tragic that Vic should give up Gardocky's safe passage for that of his treacherous wife.  Wow, it was amazing and ironic how much more villainous and detestable Corrine seemed by that point.  And his daughter?  What happened to her?  One moment she's trying to turn her own father in at the station.  By the end of the show she seems quite nice to her father again for some reason.  You can only imagine how Corrine is going to explain to her that she can no longer talk to her father for the rest of her life.  Realistic?  I didn't quite buy that Corrine would become so completely traitorous suddenly towards the end of the show, but season 7 certainly wasn't the first time she'd walked that line.  On a side note, some of her screen time acting occasionally seems kind of weak by this point.  Not that it was ever super-strong. Even from the beginning of the show, she and Vic's relationship never came off as 100% convincing.  I think he only kisses her one time in the whole series.
You never get the feeling Corine really hates Vic, though her actions and the course she follows, especially with the entry of Kavanaugh into her life, seem to say otherwise.  In this way she goes from being a rather sympathetic to detestable character by the end of the series.  Granted, the strains and danger that Vic's job and extracuricular activities put her under were enormous.

In more than one way, Mackey plays something of a modern-day Caesar.  With enemies trying to bring him down at all corners, he's a ruthless dictator of the street on one hand, a benevolent friend on the other. It's hard not to sympathize with him, and with all the rest of the strike team, in spite of what you know.  Season 7 ends the series in top form.",1305158400,,7184,4.508120649651972

As far as Season 7, it was good -- a little better than OK. Unfortunately, for me anyway, too much of the storylines revolved around two of my least favorite characters -- Corrine and Mara. Vic's daughter (real and fictional) got a lot of screen time in the first half of Season 7, and she could be the worst actress since Season 2 or 3. As far as the ending (SPOILER ALERT), I realize Vic is supposed to be in his own personal hell by the time the credits rolled, but it just didn't seem like enough punishment. Overall, I guess the end did what is was supposed to do as it evoked a lot of different emotions for me. Glad things worked out for some, sympathy for a guy who'd been an a$$hole for 7 seasons, feeling terrible for one guy who truly got the shaft, and wanting more retribution dealt to a guy who had wrecked so many lives for so long. This was a great series, but the webs became too tangled and a bit too implausible, and the lead character went from being a guilty pleasure to just plain guilty. Hats off to The Shield.

Many show's I have loved are considered some of the greatest ever made but the finale always killed it in a bad way here's examples

The Sopranos= Personally I loved the ending it left many unanswered questions which is why I kind of liked it! But of coarse I felt a little unsatisfied but I still thought it was a great way to end the show

The X-Files- Love the show to death but the finale first time watched I liked it going back it's a crappy finale and the new movie didn't help either!

OZ- Great show and I loved the finale also the first time I watched it, second viewing not so much

Hill Street Blues- Descent finale but it could have done more with some of the central characters

NYPD Blue- I Get what they we're doing with a normal day on the job type of ending and I respect that, But after 12 seasons Andy deserved a lot more of a story in the final episode then they showed

Xena Warrior Princess- It's not the whole Xena dying thing that I was pissed at just the fact they threw away years of characters and didn't include any of them in the last episode

When I think of a finale that really satisfied me in the end I think of like Buffy what a fantastic ending where I felt nothing more needed to be said

Now The Shield's finale has hit that standard, And I felt as the final frame closed that the show was at an end no more needed to be said and it loved it!

3831326,5,B0020TS5EM,"How Sean Ryan managed to pull this off on a channel as relatively tame as ""FX"" is beyond me. Since Season 1 of this bloody, Shakespearean epic, Vic Mackey and Company have done some most unpleasant things--the first thing that comes to mind would be Vic frying a murdering drugdealer's face on a stove burner, the mistaken torture and execution of Guardo in Season Six, etc etc. I am more than sure that Ryan had to work a lot harder than David Chase or David Simon (imagine trying to squeeze an hour of real art between commercials for Enzyte.)

""The Final Act"" comes extremely close to transcending anything I have ever seen on television. Learning just who Victor Samuel Mackey, and that's his full name, really was felt both exhilarating, dirty, exhausting and in the end, horrifying.  He is not the alphamale wolf who protects the clan.  He is not the complex, mysterious father figure to Shane.  He is not a righteous vigilante cop in the tradition of ""The Punisher"".

He is a bald headed demon from hell who sucks the life out of those under his satanic influence or destroys them entirely.  And he is particularly apt to do so when it is his neck on the line.  How he came to be this way and whether he knows it or not are questions we will never know (Ryan was right not to answer them, actually: the feel of this show, which is kind of like dropping Raymond Chandler into ""Training Day"", does not allow for warm reminiscence).  As the aged ICE agent who listens to Mackey's horrifying confession which seals his immunity asks Claudette ""Exactly what kind of detective did you *raise* here?"", it would be interesting to know that indeed.

In the end, though, speculation is immaterial.  When Lem got shafted by Shane with a grenade, whatever tincture of a conscience Vic Mackey possessed in the first place went right through the window.  Lem was the first Sacrifical Lamb, one of Vic's own who died because of his deluded belief in his own intelligence, and Ronnie was the second.  Time heals all wounds, I guess, because it was easier for Vic to sell his friend out so blatantly to save his own skin.  None of that anguish or rage he had when searching for Lem's killer, who was always at his back, only a begrudging and slightly pained willingness.

When Claudette finally confronts Vic in the last episode to see what he's made of, to see if there is anything remotely human left in the man, we have perhaps one of the most disturbing sequences in TV history. The ""Hitler act"" with Shane poisoning his wife and children with the threat of prison hanging over his head
(Goebbels did the same thing when ""the great man"" withdrew his affection in suicide) ultimately does not affect Vic.  He looks at the awful picture of Shane with his head blown to bits, his wife and child clutching a toy and flowers, and sits for a moment.  He blinks, represses a tear, and grins.  He is a sociopath.  If he so wills it, these kind of things will not hurt him.  The reaction to Claudette trying to probe him is akin to the Devil himself: tearing the camera off the wall with that cobra-like loook in his eye, as though to say ""You dare to judge me?"" and swaggering out of the interrogation room.

Watching Ronnie go down was the worst for me.  Though it is possible that Vic was going to tell him that he was screwed, it's pretty clear he didn't care that much.  When he screams ""RONNIE!"" as the police approach to take him straight to hell, it is only to save face in the mirror of his cracked identity.  The heated dialogue between them tells you a lot about Mackey.  He tries to tell Ronnie that he believed Karin, his wife, was ""loyal""--loyal??  Like Vic was loyal?  This is not a titanic figure at all, but a ""twisted and sick man"" as Olivia puts it.  He didn't really have any idea where all this was going and ""the team"" was BS as soon as he lost the feeling for it.

Honestly every season was great.  The one thing that I didn't like about the 7th and final season was the ending.  I waited 7 years to see that cop killing son of a [%$] Macky get killed or sentenced to prison and what happened, he walked.  After the mayhem he has caused it was a bit of a let down to see it end that way.

Buy this or buy whole series if you have never seen it.  It was a great series, well worth paying for in my eyes.",1256515200,,1197,3.921161825726141
3831330,5,B0020TS5EM,"Spoilers ahead...Other than repeating or referring to some excellent reviews I would like to here elaborate on a specific act took place in the final episode of final act. Nevertheless still a couple of words are needed to mention. Is this final season like previous ones demanding to be watched in exhilarating emotional atmosphere begging to know what is next? Yes indeed. Is the final satisfying? Yes but it would give different feelings to different people based on their view of characters and series as a whole. But not perfect. Here the main point of this review is one of Mackey's acts towards the end. And this is what he did to Ronnie. He betrayed his fellow friend next to him until the very end in a twinkle of an eye. I never had sympathy for Vic Mackey' acts or deeds but at least, despite his brutality and lack of conscious, he was loyal to his friends and Ronnie was loyal to him too. It just doesn't mesh with his past and character. I understand the events overwhelmed him and made him felt he is coming to a full circle but again just his wife's somewhat minor crime did not suffice on my side to send his -cop-friend into lifetime prison life. AND he mentioned to run many times together or alone. Even at the very end he could have warned him to run. Still such a magnificent writing and I cannot fully hold responsible of Vic's betrayal under the extreme circumstances. Furthermore Gardocki deserved such a fitting end. Vic, however, proved tt almost nothing virtuous remained with him. He cut links with his conscious which he had to and went on his life. No way could he have handled what he had done otherwise. A lost soul.. With that said I also lost my connection to the character.. 5 stars nonetheless for objective scoring. I watched the series with my girlfriend and I was so hooked up unlike with any other shows.

Obviously, Sony, as the cheap and greedy corporation that it is, considered, with the usual disregard for its costumers, that optional subtitles were too much of a luxury... shame for them, and for Amazon for not being more clear in listing the details of the products they sell (sometimes I've to go to the Barnes & Noble website to figure out the language options of a movie).

The season primarily deals with the interaction between Shane and his family and Vic with Ronnie.  Several other characters also finish their character arcs including the wonderful play between Dutch and Claudette.  I am not one of those people who have defended the actions of the Strike Team from the beginning, so I was patiently waiting to see how each of them paid the price.  I was not disappointed.

In essence, the show ends for each character the way you would want it to, with each character suffering the ultimate punishment for their sins.  Sadly, the show does pull away from characters such as Dani and Julian who get screen time, but no closure on their story arcs, especially Julian who was wasted through the final several seasons.

The Shield went out while it was still producing good episodes (like the other great Cop drama, the Wire).  Obviously if you've watched the first six seasons, you should be invested enough to see how it turns out.  I promise you won't be disappointed.",1253577600,,1274,4.824884792626728

This is clearly the fruit of writers who knew exactly how they wanted the story to end.

It would be an understatement to say that the final three episodes are amongst the most poignantly disturbing I have ever seen.

Without revealing too much, each one of the characters (with the exception of Councilman Aceveda) has a very satisfying ending. Julian's is wistful; Claudette's -- particularly if you have had a relative who has had an incurable illness -- will leave you in tears.

I disagree with some people's assessment of Dutch. At the end of the series, he appeared to me to be an Ahab-type figure -- so blinded by his obssession to catch serial killers that he doesn't care about who he is placing in harm's way with said pursuit.

Vandrell, Gardocki and Mackey? Well, each suffers a fate that mirrors their distinct deadly sin. It was almost as if the epilogue was lifted from Dante's Inferno.

I've been amazed that THE SHIELD has always kept up its level of quality for seven seasons.  THE SOPRANOS didn't, most don't.  But THE SHIELD never painted itself into a corner, never slacked off on surprising its audience.

The second kind of person looking at these reviews will be the person who's never seen THE SHIELD.  You need to start from the beginning.  Seriously.  There are so many things coming to a head here, so much character development and story crescendos that you will not be able to appreciate what makes this show so great if you jump in at any other point than the beginning.

Very good show, I have watched it since its' beginning.

THE lead,  is the baddest dude of all, his life is a pretext.",1249257600,,273,4.625
3831351,5,B0020TS5EM,"This tv series would be very difficult to watch out of order.  So the only qualifier I must give is that if you want to experience this series, you really need to see series 1-7 in order.  Do not start with season 7 or you will miss the truly Shakespearean, almost King Lear type epic tragedy, which unfolds in the final season. There is little if any comic relief in this series.  I didn't particularly miss having comic relief but this series is not for the faint of heart.

Det. Vic Mackey (Michael Chiklis) is, of course the lead.  He is a cop who had a lot of talent for the job who has gotten more and more corrupt with each season.  When the series started he had some redeeming features.  Back then he seemed to really love his wife and kids and treasure his friends on his strike team.  Now every one of those relationships has been likewise contaminated by all the evil he has engaged in from series 1-6.  He also got the job done back in season one even though no one could approve of his methods.  He's not even getting the job done right by season 7.  He is so over his head with everyone and everything that he touches, that anything within his vicinity becomes likewise contaminated and ruined.

The series is very well written and directed.  Shawn Ryan is the one who conceived the show and saw it through all seven seasons.  He kept the writing on track as well as the directing.  I am sure he must be a hero to everyone who acted on the show as virtually everyone on it was fairly unknown prior to its debut.

There are few likable people in this series.  Claudette, who has become in charge and tries to do an honest job; Dutch, the most honest and best detective; Danny, a cop on the force who had Vic's baby; Vic's wife and children; Shane's wife and children; Julian, a gay cop--that pretty much covers it on likable characters.  Certainly no one on the strike force is likable.  Perhaps the closest to likable left was Ronnie Gardocki.  He is the one who remains closest to Mackey all through the final season and Mackey now even uses him at every turn to save himself.  In season 1, that would have been unthinkable.

However, the most stunning tragedy which unfolds is the deterioration of the Mackey-Shane Vandrell relationship.  Mackey becomes obsessed with getting Shane, taking him down.  He sees Shane as the embodiment of all of his problems and in his head thinks if he can get rid of Shane, he can return to the way he was in season 1.

Walter Goggins as Shane Vandrell becomes such a tragic figure in his quest to save his wife and children from all the consequences of what he did with Mackey that he comes close to stealing the whole show.  Perhaps the most horrible thing Mackey does is paint a picture for Shane over the phone of ""Shane and his wife being in prison and his children in foster care with Mackey there to make sure all of them get the rawest deal"".  He gloats aloud over the fact that Shane can no longer hurt him because he's got a deal with the feds to save himself.  Shane knows it is all really over for him when he hangs up from this phone call.  This phone call was one of the most horrible things I've ever heard but the actions which flow from it are even worse.

What happens to Mackey is just brilliant.  It is totally fitting and apt.  It is one of the best series enders I've experienced.  I cannot say a word more about it though without spoiling it.

This is vivid, riveting, rugged drama, shot in a cinema verite style (you are there) and if you are not faint of heart, see it.  If you hate violence and unhappiness though, it may not be for you.

I guess great - no, seminal - cop shows are made to run seven seasons (perhaps to avoid ""jumping the shark"").

Michael Chiklis has left his mark on the canon of both the genre and great television with this role. My hat is off to him for an unforgettable portrait of someone who represents the ambiguity in us all.

One thing about the bonus materials on The Shield DVDs...it's always interesting and provides excellent ""peeks behind the curtain"" for the series' fans. It's made clear that the show would end with ""closure"" on Vic Mackey...perhaps to avoid the kind of backlash that came with Tony Soprano's onion ring-munching ""non-ending"" at the final moments of The Sopranos, or perhaps the complexity of the Mackey character demanded closure.

In reality, series creator Sean Ryan is a genius, because whether it's immediately clear or not, Season 7 of The Shield ended with Vic Mackey munching onion rings. Please allow me to elaborate.

The set-up is that Vic is being exiled to a cubicle for the next three years, where he'll crank out a ten-page report every day, five days a week, 52 weeks a year. We see Vic look pensively out the upper-story window as squad cars, lights and sirens in full blaze, head toward some unknown crime scene. And when he stuffs his gun in his belt and walks out of the office...the last shot of the series...we see that VIC MACKEY LOOK. The only thing that has changed is his surroundings. He's still the same coiled snake that's depicted on the Strike Team calling card used throughout the series.

Three years in Vic Mackey time is nothing, and he would game the system every inch of the way. He'd hired private detectives in the past to find his wife and kids...what possible reason do we have for believing he wouldn't do it again? Vic was simply transplanted to a new playing field. If Ryan wants to do a Shield movie, I've just handed him half the script.

CCH Pounder...Captain Wyms...provides another insight when she says in the bonus materials that she is ""cold blooded about walking away from a job well done."" It's an honest and refreshing moment from an actor in a series that was known for its brutal honesty.

One reason why NYPD Blue limped to the finish line is that every time the show lost a major character...David Caruso, Jimmy Smits, Rick Schroeder, on and on and on...the writers took a time-out to regroup, to introduce a new character, to re-build momentum, and over time it simply became tiresome.

The Shield broke the mold by keeping the freight train roaring down the track, no matter who left. They moved the character of Julien from uniformed officer to Strike Team and back to uniform again. But they never took a time-out, not even for a second. The viewer was never allowed to catch their breath.

In terms of major characters...The Strike Team...the series had to end. This became clear after Lem's death, when the only logical progression was to have Shane pay for his sins. Vic exhibits some tough talk about taking a deal from ICE only of Ronnie gets the same deal, but in the end...in true Vic Mackey style...he saved his own hide, took the deal, and sent Ronnie ""off to Antwon Mitchell-land.""

Other than the death of the Lem and Shane characters (and Captain Wyms revelation to Dutch that she is dying of lupus), Sean Ryan fed you a big, fresh from the deep-fryer platter of onion rings. There was no more ""closure"" in the final episode of The Shield than there was in the final episode of The Sopranos. If and when he decides to do a movie or any other form of follow-up, Ryan...just like Sopranos creator David Chase...can pick up the pieces right where he left them.

On the ""Blue Comet"" episode from the final series of The Sopranos, Steve Van Zandt reveals on the DVD commentary track that actor James Gandolfini, at the table read for the final episode, paused, looked up, and asked ""Why?"" (regarding the onion rings ending). Without missing a beat, David Chase replied ""Because I did not want to show that crime paid, and I did not want to show that it DID NOT pay.""

Sean Ryan did exactly the same thing with Vic Mackey. He will spend the next three years drawing a paycheck as the single most corrupt cubicle dweller on the planet. After that, he will regain full ownership of his game, with all sins from the past wiped away with the single stroke of an ICE signature.

3831371,3,B0020TS5EM,"They say every successful TV show stays on the air one or two years too long and The Shield was no exception. Even so, this final season managed to be rewarding and thought provoking, and never disappointed the show's core fans.
The energy and freshness that was so in-your-face in the early years (with a slight sag in season two) was less evident here. One of the things that made the show so cool was that everything- everything- that happened harkened back to episode one. The murder of Terry Crowley never ceased to be relevant; it was the key to the entire series and the writers did a masterful job of keeping that thread going.
Another great thing about the show was the way things just kept getting worse. Just when you thought it was as bad as it could get, a new development would ratchet up the nightmare. O what a tangled web indeed!
But gradually, most noticeably in seasons six and seven, the accumulated weight of all the baggage and history started bogging things down. By the end the show was more about talking than doing, more about self reference than plot movement or character development. The writing declined. It had to.
Season seven, while lacking the snap and juice of the early years, did bring things to a conclusion without copping out, and that wasn't easy. It stands as one of the best endings to a TV series ever, in ways no one could see coming. I regarded The Shield as the best show on television for its entire run, and somehow it found a way to wrap things up that was simultaneously believable, confounding, and strangely satisfying. At least they didn't cop out!
Fans of the show, those of us who already owned seasons one through six, well there's no way we could not buy the last DVD for our collections. It might be said that you have to watch the show from the beginning (of this more than most series!) but from beginning to end The Shield maintained its quality and engaged the viewer as few shows ever could. The story wasn't pretty, the characters were realistically flawed, and as always there was some good in the worst of them and some bad in the best; overall it was unforgettable great entertainment as well as razor sharp social commentary. Loved it!",1246060800,,2204,4.568181818181818
3831372,5,B0020TS5EM,"What is there to say about this that hasn't already been said? Possibly the best conclusion to a drama series ever; the viewer's intelligence was not insulted for one minute. Even after everything, one could still feel Vic Mackey's pain and feel ""sorry for his loss"". What a terrific performance by Michael Chiklis to turn sympathies around so effectively. It was in all senses a classic tragedy.  Ronnie Gardocki betrayed for the treacherous Corrine Mackey (though her role in this will, I suspect, be hotly debated).
Let's hope Shawn Ryan can come up with a spin off series even half as good?",1245888000,,594,4.823529411764706
3831373,3,B0020TS5EM,"The series had some really good story lines and the acting was for the most part well done.  I enjoy watching TV series when they go to disk because I can watch as many episodes as I like without commercial interruptions.  The DVDs also eliminate the dreaded ""To be continued...""

However, I had difficulty getting into any of the characters in The Shield, even without interruptions.  Maybe that was what was intended as most were corrupt or self serving, making them difficult to like.  Glenn Close was the exception and her role was far to short lived.

The show was supposed to be based in Los Angeles, yet many of the actors were from the East as were many of the terms and phrases.  The tight, close up filming didn't permit showing much of the Los Angeles scenery, more like it could have been any back East city.  While I enjoy the technique, it, like the actors, dialogue and terminology, does nothing to promote Los Angeles as the series focal point.

The technical adviser might have been from back East as well, as some of the law enforcement terms as well as the conversational phrases were not from California.  The adviser was also short on police tactics. I was unable to count the number of times the suspect escaped out the back door while all of the strike team was at the front.  Then there was the picking the captain, selecting a detective and promoting them, might happen, but not in Los Angeles.  The Civil Service commission would never allow it.  The practice added to the plot twists, but at the sacrifice of realism.

I might have enjoyed this show more if I had not seen The Wire first.  But, that aside I would recommend The Shield to anyone who enjoys police action shows, it might not be as realistic as many others but it seldom lacked pace.",1245715200,,1774,4.534591194968553
3831374,5,B0020TS5EM,"Although every episode of this season is good, the first handful of episodes are a bit slow.  They're of similar pace to the final few episodes of Season 6.  Starting at about episode 6, the season starts picking up because that is the episode where the first of many unforgivable acts of the season occurs.  The action only picks up more in episode 7, and episode 8 is one of the absolute best episodes ever made on the show, the best of the season in my opinion.  The remaining episodes are all good, but episode 12 is the next one that really stands out.  I won't say what happens, but it perfectly sets up the many explosions to come in the final episode.  Then of course, there's the final episode.  I remember hearing Michael Chiklis say before it aired that the viewers might not sleep well that night after watching it.  I was of course skeptical by that statement because scary movies hardly ever bother me.  If there was ever a time when those words held true however, it was with this show.  The finale was so shocking that I wasn't even sure after the first viewing whether or not I even liked it.  After about 2 1/2 weeks of letting the show sink in and accepting the ending, I gave it a second viewing.  After finishing that second viewing, I saw the brilliance of that final episode.  I think that the real brilliance was that the final outcome of Vic was very much in the gray area, just like how things have always been with him.  My only real compliant with the episode was that I felt that more could've been done with the Dutch story.  Having said that, it was still a brilliant episode, and an excellent ending to a phenomenal series.  Although I think episode 8 was better than the finale, both were superb, and this series remained true to its origins.  Although not all will like the way the show ends, I think it's more due to the inner struggles of the viewer.  If that doesn't make sense, I'll also say that a lot of viewers of the show were probably in denial of a few things during the course of the show.  If you still don't understand, see the ending of the show, and you will.  To put it simply, true colors will be revealed.",1245542400,,2157,4.345

3831376,3,B0020TS5EM,"Unlike ALL the previous seasons released on DVD, this season does not include subtitles.  Shame, shame, shame.  I watched the show on TV faithfully but often depended on the DVD subtitles to pick up on missed words, phrases, names, poorly articulated speech, etc.  I'm sure the subtitles were omitted for the same reason all shortcuts are taken -- to save a couple of bucks.  Well, not much we can do about that now, is there?  I hope show creator Shawn Ryan makes the smart move and insists on putting into his contract that all DVD releases of his present and future shows include subtitles.

Heck, even the pre-show interstitial disclaimer cards (""The views expressed in the enclosed commentaries are those of the speakers only and do not necessarily reflect the views of Sony Pictures..."" etc) are presented in French and Spanish in addition to English.  Obviously they are marketing this product to non-English markets but STILL don't have subtitle tracks.  It make-a no sense to me.

The folks who own the production and/or distribution rights to this DVD (Season 7) are not the least bit concerned with the quality -- just the cost.  But that's pretty much par for the course with American business nowadays.  Nothing unique in that.",1245024000,7,1240,4.885167464114833
3831377,3,B0020TS5EM,"I'm a big fan of The Shield, but it has the most opaque dialog on TV.  They saved some money by not including subtitles.  My Season 7 is going back -- it's unwatchable.",1244851200,7,168,4.0606060606060606
3831378,3,B0020TS5EM,"Ok, here is the thing, my family and I (father and brother) are proud fans of The Shield, we started to watch the series on dvd, never saw it on tv, we loved every single minute of the six seasons and were eagerly waiting for the 7th season to hit on dvd, we didn't saw it on tv because we are a Latin family and my dad still has problems to understand spoken English, well, to our surprise the 7th season DOES NOT count with a subtitle option, not even in English, which is rare because during six seasons we enjoyed the series with Spanish subtitles, now we are probably are going to have to skip the final season of a beloved show because no kind of subtitles, even close captions, were included, this is a really big disappoint, I do hope they put on sale a special edition or something like that with a subtitle option, especially when this is a series that has a big appeal to the Latin community.",1244764800,24,903,4.255813953488372
3831379,5,B0020TS5EM,"One thing about ""The Shield"" is how well the show holds up on multiple viewings.  It's probably because of the attention to detail and the numerous story arcs going on in any single episode.  This continues to be the case in the 7th and final season of the show.

Season 7 finds Det. Vic Mackey, at the end of the line.  Season 6 finished with Vic walking out on his last chance to keep his job with the LAPD and making a deal with former police Captain, now wannabe-Mayor Aciveda to take down the crooked developer who has been bankrolling Aciveda's political career.  Meanwhile, Vic's strike team is beginning to come apart at the seams, all of their former bad deeds are bubbling to the surface, and on top of that Vic's ex-wife and daughter are terrified of him.  Vic's a dirty cop with a perverted sense of justice.  He thinks that if he can nail this crooked developer AND take down the Armenian mob, it will make up for all the horrible things he has done.

The season plays out almost as a tragedy, and is the strongest season of the Shield since the powerful season 3.  Watching these episodes again, I'm most struck by the relationship between Dutch and Capt. Wymms.  Both actors do terrific work as seemingly the only people in the precinct who seem to care about Mackey's abuses, and the quest to bring him down strains them to the breaking point.

The rest of the cast is solid as always.  David Rees Snell, who plays Ronnie Gardocki on the strike team, shows a whole lot more here than he has in the past.  But the real standouts are Michael Chiklis as Mackey, and Walt Goggins as his longtime best friend/failed protege Shane Vendrell.  Goggins is outstanding in the final episodes.  He's done horrible things and he can barely live with himself, yet he continues on to try and help his wife and children.

The show ends in about the only logical place it could end.  The last three episodes in particular are shattering.  The writing, acting, and direction are all fantastic, and ""The Shield"" goes out on a highly satisfying and emotional peak.  A must own.",1244764800,61,2073,4.539083557951482
