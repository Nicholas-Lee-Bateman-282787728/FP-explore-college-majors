8678875,5,B00NLM0SBK,"If you look at the cover image for the DVD youd think that it was mostly about a designer who invented the cats eye glasses worn by movie stars in the 1950s. That point of her life takes may 3-5 minutes of this fascinating 89 minute documentary film from her grandson.

Altina tells much of her own story through filmed interviews  mostly in the 1970s when she was about 70 years old. She was married four times  -the first at age 17 -and though her later husbands (two of who were refugees (one from Europe, the last from Cuba) were as much as 30 years younger than her she (according to her last husband still had a heavy sexual appetite that even he had a hard time keeping up with).  She was born to a wealthy Jewish family (and her Jewishness directed many of her humanitarian efforts). She was an artist as a painter but most known for her benches and artistic chairs). He won an Oscar nomination for best documentary on about Nazi Brutality and her two sons won an Oscar for a documentary they made.  She was rich and lived in a mansion in the US and traveled the world.

The interviews with her son and two of her husbands ties this all together. I really don't want to say much more as I found that the film taught me a lot about this woman who I had never heard of from watching her story unfold.  So if you are into modern art, learning how the youngest of three sisters who came from wealth entered the art world (and married four times), I can recommend this DVD.

There are two bonus features: First is a photo/art gallery (silent  no soundtrack  that runs about 2  minutes. Next is a 15 minute segment titled Reflections on Altina which consists of deleted interviews. Whats odd is that there is a black screen that lasts as much as 15-20 seconds between the scenes. Not sure why. You think the bonus is over but then comes another interview.

Another fine documentary release from First Run Features

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.
