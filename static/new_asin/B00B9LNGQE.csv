5564675,5,B00B9LNGQE,My husband was a happy man when this arrived. A dvd and 2 cd's...can't go wrong with Slightly Stoopid! Great price.,1368576000,,115,4.523809523809524
5564676,3,B00B9LNGQE,"This is NOT DVD Audio. Everything mentioned in the Amazon add is wrong. What I received is a 3-disc set. There is one DVD Video and one CD with the first set of the show and one CD of the second Set. There is NO DVD Audio in this item. The DVD Audio player in my 2004 Acura TL completely rejected the Video disc. And it clearly sees the other two as CD's.

Now with that said, I'm keeping the item because I don't believe there is an actual DVD Audio version available. And having the video for home use is pretty cool.",1367884800,3,519,4.038834951456311
5564677,5,B00B9LNGQE,"If you could only have one Slightly Stoopid album available, this would have to be the one. I personally think many of the best versions of their songs are on it. There are some songs that I was so/so on before this album, like ""Anywhere I Go"" and ""Fat Spliffs"". Now they're favorites.

I've been listening to this album for two months straight  you can't go wrong here.",1409184000,,370,4.426470588235294

5564684,5,B00B9LNGQE,"Great video andcomes with 2 CDs.  My grandson is only 11 months and I had recorded it of palladia but we deleted it by mistake.  So, I bought the set.  But the bad words are not deleted so by 2 I'm not going to let him watch it anymore.  He can be crying and I pop the video in and he stops.  I think it's all the different instruments.",1386547200,,336,3.8115942028985508

8564710,5,B00B9LNGQE,"Anyone that enjoys classic rock, reggae, blues or other guitar-prominent music will enjoy this band. I really wish they included 2 a.m. and their UB40 cover, I Would Do For You in this set, but as it stands, it's one of my favorite Rock performances (comparing favorably to my Led Zeppelin - Song Remains The Same and The Who - Live At Leeds) and in my top 5 favorite performances. Search "" Closer To The Sun "" live and just watch Karl Denzen trill out his Sax solo and you'll be hooked. Women- if your guy likes rock music, he'll love this as a gift. Everyone of my friends that have seen the DVD or listened to the CD want copies (to which I reply, ""Buy your own - Cheapskates!"" )",1423785600,,682,4.213740458015267
