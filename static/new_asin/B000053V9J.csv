1390183,4,B000053V9J,"My almost 3 year old son likes There Goes a Tractor a lot.  We've seen almost all the There Goes a .. series videos, and this one is one of his favorites.  Also, he likes this same Dave in There Goes a Dumptruck.  I didn't like this Dave's style as much as Dave Hood, who stars in the others, but my son seems to like both of them just fine.",1038355200,2,341,3.842857142857143
1390184,5,B000053V9J,I like Dave because not only because he is a good actor also because he played my favortie newsboy in Newsies so if you've seen it compare his acting skills in Newsies and in this movie there all in the same game and I love David he is a good host and a fantastic actor just watch Newsies and then consider watching this movie again.,1036108800,,333,4.138461538461539
1390185,5,B000053V9J,"My son is 17 months old and has always loved tractors. So I got him this video and he just loves it!  This is the first video he has ever watched from beginning to end. I have since been looking into other videos that have tractors and showed them to him but he just doesn't like them as much.  I can see why too.  I actually like this one better too.  I have seen it about 200 times already and I don't hate it yet.  ""Farmer Dave"" does a good job.  They talk about the basics of running a farm.  They go to a dairy farm and show the basics of how ice cream is made and cheese.  Like I said, my son loves it and wants to watch it every morning when he wakes up.  I would recommend it to anyone who asked.",1032912000,,704,3.8333333333333335
1390186,5,B000053V9J,"While it is a little hokey, anything that can keep 2 year old twin boys' rapt attention for 1/2 hour is a great thing!  When we first got the video, we watched it 3 and 4 times a day.  They kept asking for ""tractor""!  They love it because, not only does it feature tractors, it has cows and helicopters.  A must have for toddler boys!",1019520000,,334,4.092307692307692
1390187,5,B000053V9J,My son is two and he loves this video.  We had trouble getting him to sit and watch anything on tv.  He would only sit for the first five minutes of blue's clues and sit for nothing else.  I got him a few tractor videos and now he wants to watch them all the time.  It really helps because I also have a 6 month old.  I could never get anything done until I purchased this video.,1001808000,2,379,3.8701298701298703
1390188,3,B000053V9J,"As the original review mentioned, this ""Dave"" is not Dave Hood, the originator of the ""There Goes a ....."" series.  If you could take out Hood's ""konk yourself on the head and fantisize"" stuff and put him in place of Mr. Sidoni (the new ""Dave""), this tape would be pretty good.  Mr. Hood does have a good narration voice and is a better fit for the movie than the immature replacement (who is also present in ""There Goes a Dumptruck"" and perhaps others.)  The subject matter was interesting in that it discussed tractors, seed drills, dairy operation, and briefly touched on making Safeway ice cream.  I wonder why they even bothered with an incomplete and very brief subject on cheese making.  For the subject matter, Fred Levine's ""Farm Country Ahead"" is 100% better.  Though Dave Hood can get one one's nerves, his replacement makes him look a whole lot better.",983232000,4,864,4.726666666666667
1390189,3,B000053V9J,"We have ALL of the ""There Goes"" series, and my kids (ages 2 and 4) were thrilled to have a new one to watch.  They did want to know where the ""real Dave"" was, but still enjoy watching all the farm machinery in action.  I do miss the emphasis on safety that the ""real Dave"" usually has...tractors (and especially the tools they pull) are very dangerous.  As are the fertilizers and pesticides shown sprayed from the helicopter.  This tape makes no mention of the hazards on the farm, and I wish it did.  Still, it's entertaining and educational, and does get across some of the work involved in producing food.  I wouldn't make this the first ""There goes a..."" tape I bought for my kids, but it's a good addition to a collection if your kids are fascinated by anything containing a combustion engine.",982713600,4,799,4.513888888888889
7930105,5,B000053V9J,Such a great kids vid. Too bad the audio was so quiet it cant be heard much. Great seller. Refunded immediately.,1423872000,,112,4.380952380952381

7930108,2,B000053V9J,"I bought this for my 3 year old grandson who loves love loves tractors and big machinery.  It was enjoyable,",1362096000,,108,4.4
7930109,5,B000053V9J,"Some prefer the old Dave and Becky, to this new goofy-sweet Dave, but we love this one!  The old Dave and Becky are just annoying to me, and I don't appreciate the bicker-style interaction.  This Dave inspires reenactments from my 3 year old, since last year, and I think is more relatable to his age group.

My son loves the tractors in this one, the cupholders for a ""nice cool drink"", Dave's interactions with the real people, Dave's mishaps with his intructions and the whole seed figuring doing-the-wrong-thing scene at the feed store (the ""do you guys deliver"" scene is my son's favorite to play act!), the helicopter, the milk tanker truck, the cows, the ice cream connection, etc.  He just loves it all.

My son is a big tractor aficionado, and this is but one source of tractor enterntainment and information for him.

I'm going to look into if there are any more of these videos with the new Dave, as we have a whole slew of the older ones and this is by far his favorite.",1251936000,,982,4.48876404494382
7930110,5,B000053V9J,"This is a great children's video all about tractors. It is from the ""there goes a"" series. My son loves it!",1125705600,,107,4.142857142857143
7930111,5,B000053V9J,"Not only does this video give the adults who patiently sit through ""There goes a..."" videos time, and time again, a good-natured and light-hearted break from the too-tight pants, banal humor and pompacity of Dave Hood, is has humor and whimsy your kids will love and you will appreciate. This new Dave is sweet and fun and my sons love him!!! I wish he starred in more of the ""There goes a.."" videos because my boys think he's funny and I can tolerate him so much more!! So far, we have only seen him in ""Tactors"" and ""Dumptrucks"" (which is fantastic as well!!). This video is on heavy rotation at my house, and if you have young fans of heavy equipment like I do, this will become THE favorite!!",1066780800,4,696,4.403100775193798
7930112,1,B000053V9J,"My son loves the ""There goes a"" video series, especially the humor of Dave and sometimes Becky.  He was really excited to watch this new video until he realized Dave, the old Dave, had been replaced.  What a disappointment.  I guess it's the older videos for us.",1061596800,6,262,4.531914893617022
7930113,5,B000053V9J,"This by far, has been the only video/show my child is interested in.  With an innate passion for tractors, my son loves this video which shows implements, dairies, as well as many different tractors.  Dave Sidoni is extremely annoying, especially after the 100th time but my son loves him.",1051660800,2,289,4.877551020408164
7930114,3,B000053V9J,"This installment of the popular There Goes A .... series is not as good as others.  As a matter of fact, I'd say it is one of the worst, though kids will still enjoy it.  The host is Dave Sidoni rather than Dave Hood, and the emphasis is on goofiness rather than on charm or information.  While we do see lots of tractors and many attachments are shown (plow, fertilizer, spreader, etc.), including the inside of the cab, these devices are not explained terribly well or examined closely.  Similarly, Dave visits a seed store, maintenance garage, milking facility, and ice cream and cheese manufacturers, but nothing is really explained in any depth, as other tapes in the series do.  Still, if your child loves tractors, they will not be put off by goofy Dave or a lack of information.  They will enjoy this tour of a big farm (not a friendly mom-and-pop farm with animals running around, unfortunately).  Dave also rides in a helicopter to fertilize a field.
My advice: if your child is primarily interested in tractors, get this video; if you are just starting on this fun series and don't really care where you start, then try There Goes a Firetruck or There Goes a Bulldozer first -- they are funnier and more interesting.",1046304000,9,1227,4.652777777777778
