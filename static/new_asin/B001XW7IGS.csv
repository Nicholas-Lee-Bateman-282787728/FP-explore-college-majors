8347814,4,B001XW7IGS,"This workout is a great find because it is challenging to find a workout dvd that uses exercise loops or ""rings"".  This is one-on-one toning - there is no class of students. The instructor starts out with a standing warm-up and then proceeds to demonstrate exercises using a chair, exercise tubing and exercise ring loops, followed by a standing cool down. Takes place in a nice studio with large windows overlooking a city.

Two things that stand out positively for me are the instructor's cueing and the music.

The instructor tells you what part of your body each movement develops to prepare you and does a good job of describing the movement before you do it without breaking the flow of the workout.  She also counts the number of reps out loud while focusing on breathing.  There are appropriate pauses between toning moves to ""shake out"".

Two criticisms:  1) Floor movements were mixed in with standing movements. I personally don't like getting up and down from the floor during workouts.  2) The warm up starts out with unsupported squats. I am not a fan of squats or lunges anyway, but definitely not in the warm-up phase.

The music is simple, rhythmic and upbeat and at the right level.  I appreciated the non-frantic pace of the music because muisc that is annoying or too loud can spoil an entire exercise video for me.  Highly recommended for beginners and intermediates!",1332028800,3,1388,4.7899159663865545
