8509787,2,B0074EIY9Y,"Some knights become cursed and will turn into gargoyles unless the curse is removed. They must seek out the feared black dragon to remove the curse.  They are aided by Aerona (Cecily Fay) who recited her lines in a very dry fashion. Her choreography had my head scratching.  She tried to do that urban fighting stuff where you jump up on a wall and turn around, but she couldn't get that far up the wall which made it look comical. In one seen she fights with a towel, perhaps a tribute to her former film, ""Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.""

One of the Knights did have personality and some good lines but only one of the Knights.

This is certainly not the worst dragon film, but might be one for the kids instead.",1417219200,,717,4.368421052631579
