8134317,5,B000GSJLM4,What a blessing this film is! So awesome. Amazing stories. Just don't pay too much for it if you can.,1440547200,,101,4.1
8134318,5,B000GSJLM4,"Amazing DVD that will make you weep as a Jewish man repents and believes in Yeshua, and an Arab man who used to hate and persecute Jews repents and believes in Jesus, and God causes them to begin to love one another in Christ. Other examples of biblical reconciliation based on the same biblical faith in the gospel are shown. A powerful reminder that it is the gospel and the Prince of Peace (Jesus Christ) who brings peace. All types of ""peace"" are temporal, and do not affect us for eternity.

Jews for Jesus produced this DVD.

If only peace could prevail...but why do some forbid it?  Thankfully, others are trying to go against the tide of hatred and hearts are changing.",1374883200,,308,4.773584905660377

8134321,5,B000GSJLM4,"This is one of the most amazing and inspirational video's I have ever seen.  It is so popular when I share it with friends, that everyone wants a copy and I cannot keep enough copies on hand.  This video has true stories of Jews and Palestinians who are friends, beyond all political or worldly understanding, on the basis of their shared love for Yeshua (Jesus).  There is one poignant example of two men who were in rival armies - hating each other - killing each other's people - who now love one another as brothers, and even willing to die for each other.  Only God can create relationships this loving and loyal.

These stories are all true.  Some are shocking.  Some invoke sadness.  But all are heartwarming and inspirational.  It is too bad you do not see these true stories on the evening news.  This is the real heart behind the scenes in Israel.  Very much worth your time and money.  Be ready to have more than one copy on hand.",1203811200,8,941,4.43859649122807
