8235202,5,B000ZBWOYO,"I'm a new Downhere fan, so it's a shame they won't be touring any time soon and certainly not to Australia. This DVD gives an up close and personal look at life on the road -  crowded into a van, sleeping on the floor in an airport terminal, going crazy on a ferry.  These are genuinely nice guys, dealing with illness, missing loved ones, the disappointment of breaking an instrument and eating bad food.  Not to mention the cold.  As an Australian, I couldn't comprehend just how cold it must have been. I especially enjoyed the segment where the band pondered where they may be in 10 years time. Ten years on, they are pretty much where they thought they would be with wives and children and making a significant impact in the lives of fellow believers. The frightening thing? They hardly look to have aged a day! I enjoyed the short clips of songs but would've preferred some longer performances too, as I am only familiar with the later albums.",1391904000,2,949,4.5321637426900585

8235204,4,B000ZBWOYO,"Downhere has an incredible message and a very creative method of sharing that message. It is always interesting to see the lives behind the scene and the not so glamorous backdrop to the nights of lights and cameras. The roadtripping detail of this DVD will give every musician pause to consider what it really takes to be a burgeoning star. Until you really ""make it"" in the music business you have to pay your dues. These guys work hard for the money and it is clear that they are driven by the Holy Spirit. One thing you do not see in the midst of all the travel, stage set-ups, less than optimal sleep arragements, events that aren't really what was expected, is the guys losing their tempers or appearing like prima donnas. I was and am impressed with this group of talented folks and hope the best for them. One thing I wish we would have seen more of was performance footage, even if it would have been limited angles, home made video quality footage. I finished the video thinking, ""hey, this disc would sell better if they had added more live production."" I suppose that is why we have YouTube. I am sure they would say that all they meant to produce was a ""view from the road.""",1245542400,3,1187,4.424657534246576
