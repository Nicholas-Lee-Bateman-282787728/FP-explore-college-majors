8007681,3,B00018D3KA,I am a huge jackie chan fan but this film is somewhat disappointing. The action is poorly done and the humor was usually ultra infantile with a handful of good jokes. The acting is fairly convincing even though almost all the characters act like 5 years old. It is an interesting choice to hide part of the main villains face until the finale but its payoff was poor. The story was decent but i cant really recommend this unless you are a sports fan who wants to see jackie act like an infant,1459036800,,492,4.301075268817204

8007686,3,B00018D3KA,Good action fighting as usual in Chan movies.  But overall not very exciting. Chan and his friend are a little old to be playing the mischievous roles played in this movie.,1338940800,,172,4.548387096774194
