3916435,4,B002EAYDSE,"Guy Madison was one of my favorites back in the 50s.  ""The Command"" is one of the best of the ""B"" Westerns about the battles between the Army and the Indians for pocession of the western lands.  Good action all around.  It's unfortunate that I can't find, on DVD, one of my all-time favorite movies, ""The Charge at Feather River"".  I think that was Guy Madison's best movie.  Overall, this DVD is in excellent quality and the packaging was good.  Service was excellent.",1342828800,8,469,4.590361445783133
3916436,5,B002EAYDSE,I appreciate the re-release of this film and films like it.  These were the movies that kept me going to the Saturday shows for kids.  I am guessing that most people today do not remember these fantastic actors and actresses.  They were and are still my heros.  Most enjoyable to watch and relax.,1332633600,3,296,4.528301886792453
3916437,5,B002EAYDSE,"This 1954 film is one of the first was Warner Bros Cinemascope releases. I was surprised to see Joan Weldon and James Whitmore both played in the Sci-Fi movie ""Them!"" form the same year. Joan looked a tad different so I had to do a double take. I remember Whitmore best as ""On Thursday We Leave for Home"" (1963) as Capt. William Benteen.

When the commanding officer of 7th cavalry is dispatched by an arrow, Capt. Robert MacClaw (Guy Madison) a medical officer and short timer is forced to take over and take the troop home. On the way home the troops are pressed into a wagon train escort with the infantry. To keep up face for his cavalry troops Capt. MacClaw wares the insignia of a line officer and this may prove to be his downfall or the salvation of all.

The story depicts a man with imagination and initiative in the military as if that was the exception. Yet the training nowadays includes that kind of resourcefulness and when deprived of resources to complete the commanders intent at every level.

You will want a copy as this is a keeper and you will not get tired of re-watching.",1305417600,,1095,4.465
