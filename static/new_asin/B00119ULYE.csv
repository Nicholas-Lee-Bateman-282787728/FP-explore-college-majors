8241166,5,B00119ULYE,"I think this film has a great message for today's society.  It's a simple message: laws can have unintended consequences when their spirit is not followed by ""rogue"" enforcement agencies or people.  It's definitely something worth thinking about, in that some laws created to have a positive effect can have drastic consequences when thier corollaries (or even a direct interpretation) are extended for purposes other than the law's original intent.  A wonderful short!",1197849600,4,469,5.397260273972603
8241167,5,B00119ULYE,"By Blood and By Water: Just who defines ""crime"" as the War on Terror is widened and old fears of Witchcraft are revived? By Blood and By Water is a tense thriller featuring a multi-national, multi-ethnic cast and crew. A great little film for those who enjoy that retro 1960's-1970's film feel!",1197676800,3,294,4.673076923076923
