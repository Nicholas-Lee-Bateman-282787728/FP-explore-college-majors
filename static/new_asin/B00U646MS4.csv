7029242,1,B00U646MS4,"Bad everything, story, characters, dialogue, filming, acting the lot.

It shocked how bad the acting was because Tom Sizemore and Bai Ling are good actors yet here they are terrible.

I watched about 3/4 and turned it off.",1432512000,,222,4.815789473684211
7029243,1,B00U646MS4,"I got suckered into renting this film by watching the trailer on demand. I was surprised to see Bai Ling in the game again. She is terrific in the film. The only reason why you would want to spend money on this. She has a wild eyed intensity wasted by the producers of this project. The dialog seems to be improvised on the spot. Tom Sizemore goes on and on with ridiculous boring diatribes. I kept hoping he'd blow his nuts off jamming his pistol into his crotch dozens of times thinking it would make a point! Vivica A. Fox doesn't say much and spends most of the movie sitting on a warehouse toilet. Melissa Mars, looking hot and totally lost, gets angry at everyone and everything for little apparent reason. The action makes no sense. Clay peons come in and out of nowhere, just an excuse for Mark Mikita to twist their arm, break their neck, then pass lament on how others kill people for money. The whole thing is ludicrous. Why they bothered making this, I don't know. Just hope it gives Bai Ling another shot at better projects. She's insane, we know, but that makes for great presence on screen.",1432512000,3,1105,4.448275862068965
7029244,2,B00U646MS4,"I'm no stranger to bad action movies or horrible Independent film efforts. I'm reminded of Michael Dudikoff's wooden acting in the early American Ninja movies, and other would-be action stars in similar low-budget travesties. So, regardless of the pain, I make it a policy to always sit through the entire movie before writing a review. It honors the time and energy of every human that was involved with bringing the production to fruition, and once in a while, I am surprised as things turn around. This is not one of those times. After a promising opening sequence, this film suffers.

As far as silver linings, the martial arts master - Mark Mikita - certainly has some moves. However, I don't think they were showcased very well with this production style, and he needs a lot more experience/coaching to develop a film presence and escape a robotic delivery of his lines. Conversely, Vivica Fox and Tom Sizemore do have acting skills. That helped. But both were ill-served with poor writing, limited sets, flat dialogue and a supporting cadre of ""raw"" actors and actresses, i.e., the goons. The editing style also seemed to omit brief parts of the story transitions, but it might just be that they were never filmed. Bai Ling, as the bodyguard, is a bit of a wild card. I've never seen this actress, though she clearly has other credits. Admittedly, she had a pleasant impact with her eyes and body language, but otherwise was pulled down by the surroundings. One last prop to Chris Jai Alex who played Sizemore's lead henchman... he did it well under the circumstances.

Parental Advisory: No nudity or sex, but if this was a drinking game every time the word F**K was used, I'd be dead. You also have modest blood with a few of the fight scenes.

Rating: Part of me wishes I hadn't stumbled upon this one, and I debated writing a review at all. However, what's done is done. I'm sure some folks will disagree, but on my Indie scale, this is barely a 2 out of 5. Yes, I've seen that many films over the years that were worse. Go into this one with very low expectations.",1432166400,,2076,4.635869565217392
7029245,2,B00U646MS4,"Wow! very bad acting and unbelievable story line (unbelievable as in not believable instead of the expletive equivalent of ""great""). This movie could be the right prescription to fall asleep on days you cannot. There is an ancient saying in China that I heard while traveling there years ago, that ""even dung has its use"". Well, this is perfect medicine to give you the Zzzz's.",1446681600,,377,4.815384615384615

7029253,4,B00U646MS4,"This is an action movie with Tom Sizemore, Bai Ling, and Vivica A. Fox. Their performances are really good, but the story isn't as developed as it could have been. The movie is mostly carried by the action, along with some great cinematography. The music is riveting and it really helps support the visuals-especially during the fight scenes. The only thing that really needed to be improved was the sound. It's muffled in a couple of places. It can be hard to hear the dialogue in a few lines, especially near the end of the movie. But who needs to listen to dialogue in an action movie, right? If you're expecting a really thought provoking movie with a great script, then don't watch action movies. But if you just want a fun, entertaining movie, that's not going to make you think too hard, then I recommend this.",1432857600,2,817,4.5646258503401365
