6815165,5,B00PKO9KG6,"I love all of the Super Simple Song CDs so I was very excited to find this DVD. My two-year-old daughter loves it too. We got down on the floor and did motions for many of the songs. All of the Super Simple Songs are truly ""simple"" for young children and children learning new verbal skills to quickly learn and sing along.  At the same time, the songs are fun and engaging. The animations on the dvd are fun and appealing to younger children. As I said, my two-year-old daughter enjoys the dvd but I can also imagine my six-year-old neice liking it too. Beyond that age, it probably depends greatly on the child's individual interests and overall development.  The Super Simple Learning website has many free printables to go along with the songs which is a nice bonus.",1451606400,,770,4.532374100719425

6815201,5,B00PKO9KG6,"The Super Simple Songs DVD's are a great learning tool for little kids. My granddaughter loves them all and she is learning so much. The animal DVD is great! ""Walking in the Jungle"" was one of her favorites from the beginning and now she gets to watch it on the DVD. Thank you for making an educational and learning DVD for little kids. We all enjoy watching her interact with the video.",1430006400,,387,4.388888888888889
6815202,4,B00PKO9KG6,My child loves it.,1428710400,,18,3.75
6815203,5,B00PKO9KG6,"Heres what I love about the DVD:
* nice slow pace (the only exception is when the Animals on the Farm song gets faster & faster at the end).
* repetitive & predictable lines in the songs.
* nice heavy beat.
* most encourage movement.
* pleasant vocals & melodies (parents, teachers & therapists will appreciate tunes that won't drive you crazy to hear again & again).
* high quality graphics.
* has the potential to be incorporated in so many different ways! Parents, early childhood educators, special educators, ELL teachers, speech-language pathologists, occupational therapists, physical therapists, kids yoga teachers, PE teachers & more could all find ways to incorporate this DVD.

Here are a few ideas I have from the perspective of a SLP & kids yoga teacher:
* Good Morning Mr. Rooster could be used to start the childs day or start a class or therapy session. Many of the patients I see thrive on having routines and respond well to songs to help with transitions.
* Lets Go to the Zoo, Walking in the Jungle, Yes I Can! & Wag Your Tail all depict specific movements. Some even have a split screen with an animal on one side and the character on the other both doing the same movement. This could easily be incorporated into goals for gross motor imitation.
* Hickory Dickory  Crash! has 6 animals starting with a tiny mouse. Each animal is bigger than the next. Love the stretched out ending to allow kids time to predict what might happen.
* My Teddy Bear incorporates counting & body parts. I love how the video zooms in on each body part.
* I have a Pet would be fun to incorporate into goals for imitation of animal sounds & vocabulary.
* Yes, I Can! would be fun to target answering yes/no questions either verbally or via AAC.
* Mary Had a Kangaroo would be fun to target adjectives.
* The Animals on the Farm would be another one to target animal sounds. This song does speed up so the last portion may not be appropriate for kids who are easily over stimulated.
* What Do You Hear? would be a fun way to target listening & talking about I hear a ______ via PECS, AAC or verbally.
* Wag Your Tail would be fun to target fast / slow.
* After A While Crocodile is a nice soothing song that would work well to end a class or therapy session. Again using a song to ease that transition.

6815208,5,B00PKO9KG6,"I just have to say that this company, Super Simple Songs, is a phenomenal resource for young children's music and movement activities.  I teach 3-5 year olds with disabilities, and I find that these songs are perfect for them, but my own typically-developed children also really love it!  Coincidentally, so do I!  They are fun, functional, and a wonderful aid for developing speech/language skills in children who struggle. They are also great for teaching basic math and other early academic concepts, and I use them to work on gross motor skills with my students as well. I own every product that this company has made, and I will continue to buy every new thing that they come out with.  They just keep getting better with every product.  I also recommend them on social media sites where I participate in teaching discussions.  They have made such a difference in my teaching life that I want to show others how great they are too.
Thanks, SSS, for making me a better teacher :)
