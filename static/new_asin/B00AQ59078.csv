5467668,5,B00AQ59078,Great movies!,1417219200,,13,6.0
5467669,5,B00AQ59078,A gift for my brother. One of the discs was loose but my brother said it wasn't damaged and worked fine. He loved it.,1416009600,,117,3.9166666666666665
5467670,4,B00AQ59078,I Bought This For Gone FishIn. It Is A Cute Movie. But The Other Two Are Not So Good. The Price Was Right Though.,1399334400,,113,3.75
5467671,4,B00AQ59078,"Funny movies worth a few bucks for some laughs im a joe and danny fan, and Dave foley plays a perfect part.",1395878400,,107,3.909090909090909
5467672,3,B00AQ59078,Some good moments but overall a bit dull. Mafia was the best with good slapstick humor. Gone Fishin is just plain silly.,1393286400,,120,4.5
5467673,3,B00AQ59078,"This is convenient, Gone Fishing was the movie that I was most interested in, it has been hard to get to play but it does play after many attempts.  The movie Mafia is terrible so I wouldn't recommend it to anyone but thats what you get sometimes in the multi-packages!",1389657600,,269,4.38
5467674,4,B00AQ59078,"Dave Foley rules in The Wrong Guy. So does Craig from Malcolm in the middle. This set is cheaper than a copy of TWG by itself, plus you get a movie that has Danny Glover and Joe Pesci just chillin'. What could be more relaxing?",1376870400,,227,4.066666666666666
5467675,5,B00AQ59078,"I bought this because Dave Foley mentioned it on WTF and said it was never released it because studio bought it out by Disney. He said it was ""the best work I have ever done"". You know what he was right, my wife who does not like Foley was laughing her ass off especially for last 50 minutes.

Mafia is just a good as the Gone Fishin. You just ask why?",1371427200,,352,3.9577464788732395
8555917,3,B00AQ59078,"The other half wanted gone fishin so this set was ordered. As for myself, I like dry or dark comedy. Mafia is so slapstick stupid, only the actors make it watchable. The Wrong Guy was not bad. We stopped this near the beginning when our guy starts crying and throwing a hissy fit when getting the news he wasn't promoted. As the movie went on, it became a decent movie. I am also a fan of Danny Glover and Joe Pesci. It was ok, again, because  of our cast. My biggest criticism is the fact that none of these movies had closed captioning.",1516233600,,538,4.223300970873787
8555918,5,B00AQ59078,it was excellent.,1505606400,,17,5.0
8555919,3,B00AQ59078,Ddn't care for the first two but 'Gone Fishin' was great.,1495065600,,57,4.2727272727272725
8555920,5,B00AQ59078,"The review is solely about The Wrong Guy. Even if the other 2 movies are trash, it's worth the purchase just for this hidden gem.
The Wrong Guy is non-stop stupid humor. Not stupid in the sense that Amy Schumer, Big Bang Theory and other modern ""comedies"" are stupid but in the sense that Airplane! was stupid humor. The movie never takes itself seriously and recognizes it's a comedy throughout. There's no preaching. No political lectures. No desperate attempts to draw out every emotion known to man.",1494720000,,503,4.793103448275862
8555921,5,B00AQ59078,Love these movies,1486166400,,17,5.0
8555922,5,B00AQ59078,"Bought for the Wrong Guy, as we are fans of KITH. Dave Foley's particular style of humor is through out. If you are a fan of his you will appreciate the movie. It is a cheesy early 90's comedy with Foley doing what he does best,... himself!",1483228800,,240,4.127659574468085
8555923,5,B00AQ59078,"I got this movie for the ""Gone Fishin"" movie; I didn't know anything about the other two. They are pretty good but the ""Gone Fishin"" is the gem.",1468108800,,144,4.178571428571429
