8248900,5,B001332M90,"Again, kudos to Amazon and NARA for bringing this rare title to the public in an affordable, high-quality medium.  I'd never heard of this title, which a full-lenght, WW2 period documentary on the Alaska Highway construction.  The title is a bit mis-leading (as some NARA titles are) as this is all period WW2 color footage, and not ranging from 1940-1949, but during the war years specifically.  Some of this footage has surfaced in shows on the History Channel, but this is the full movie, and alll in sharp, period color.  Fantasic!",1202688000,4,535,4.846153846153846
