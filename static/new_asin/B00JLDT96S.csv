6378007,1,B00JLDT96S,"I already own this version of the Ten Commandments and enjoy it; the first two of the four story set were bleary and the music styles were more like ""spaghetti westerns"". The third one was okay, and the last one was unbearable! It was a disgrace to the Jewish people portrayed. I usually view any movie to its end however, the three I described were only worth 15 minutes.",1413072000,16,372,4.405797101449275

8652088,5,B00JLDT96S,I got this out of the $5.00 bin at Walmart. So the price is expensive but I also didn't expect the highest quality. I am very happy with my purchase but I wouldn't buy it from Amazon. Look in the bins at Walmart.,1452902400,6,212,3.953488372093023
