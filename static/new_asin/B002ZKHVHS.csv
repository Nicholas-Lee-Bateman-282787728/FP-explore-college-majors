4041366,5,B002ZKHVHS,You'll wish it went on beyond the 14 episodes.  Don't bother with 15 its just a recap.  Put it away a while then watch it again.,1410912000,,128,3.8846153846153846

4041369,4,B002ZKHVHS,"It's pretty good, older show with Sean Bean younger, that's a plus. My sister likes it a lot, she's a fan of Sean Bean.",1356566400,,119,4.0
4041370,5,B002ZKHVHS,"This is the third of five set of Sharpe's DVDs we have purchased. Each one contains 3 action packed DVDs. We are smitten. The quality of the video and sound is quite good. I wish they had subtitles. I am getting used to the introduction/prelude. We just start the movie and leave the room for a while. We return to start the actual movie a little later. hahaha These films are so entertaining. Each one is self-contained, with a plot, and an ending. Really a great way to augment our books by Bernard Cornwell. I recommend buying the sets. They give you almost all the books that have been turned into films. The other series (Rifles, Revenge, etc.) are all included in the sets. We Bought 5 sets, Sharpe's Challenge and Peril. That gives us all the videos made so far from the Sharpe Books by Bernard.",1348963200,5,802,4.462585034013605
4041371,5,B002ZKHVHS,"This is a great series, This a story about a common english soldier who rose from the ranks who was not treated as a real officer, one who did not buy his commisson. I couldn't stop watching it, I have bought all of the Sharpe series, this one shown here is not as complete as buying the sets.  This part was made for Sean Bean, I wish there would be a finale as to his daughter. Assumpta Serna was terrific also as well as Daragh O'Mally and all the fine actors "" The Chosen Men"" all well cast in their parts. War, some humor, love and the trust of his men. I enjoyed the history. I seldom like movies with war but this is a series not to miss. Sean Bean also starred in ""Game of Thrones"" season one on HBO. You're better off buying the sets such as those listed below, more programs on these. Also the last two are Sharpe's Peril and Sharpe's challege sold individually at present. Tho some reviews say the history has its errors,as well as USA series. I didn't mind, I loved the entire series.
