3048328,2,B0010AN7QI,"The beautiful Gigi Edgery is in this film, you know her from the Farscape TV Show. I think I also saw this flick on the Scify channel before, though I did not recognize the title when I rented it. It's not to bad, middle of the road. No fancy special effects here, it's pretty low budget in that respect. Gigi, Jason London, and Cody Bell save this movie, since they are the best actors, and their scenes carry the movie along. Most of the other actors are just there, or over-acting. Nothing really new here as far as scifi goes.",1331856000,,530,4.31
3048329,4,B0010AN7QI,"I have to say I normally hate SciFi movies!  But my husband likes them so we watched this together and I actually got into it!  It is low budget, but beyond that, it is a great story line and good actors.  I would recommend this movie!",1303516800,2,235,4.065217391304348
3048330,5,B0010AN7QI,The effects in this movie are good.  The plot is interesting.  I think this was a very well-made movie.  It's not that gory or anything but something else makes it really good.  I think you'll enjoy it if you see it.  It's unique and very entertaining.,1240790400,11,252,4.391304347826087
3048331,5,B0010AN7QI,"Given the stellar performances by Jeff Knox and his truck, it baffles me that he was not mentioned in the Title. I feel that he truly made this movie what it is; Jeff Knox is a true thespian",1226966400,,190,4.026315789473684
3048332,3,B0010AN7QI,Above average for the sci-fi channel but still a bit under par. Its a original story but just about everything else is recycled. I found the acting also to be a bit plain. But not bad for B-movie thrills.,1210636800,3,204,4.256410256410256

Its not that its a bad movie, it just has some special effect issues that bothered me. Now i know that they didn't have a huge budget to work with so im understanding with that. It just didn't captivate me, the story isn't that great, it is lacking in originality, but what can you do with this genre that hasn't already been done? So i think a score of 3 is just right. Not a buy, a rent.",1207872000,8,497,4.03030303030303

8237533,3,B0010AN7QI,"Two space ships have the misfortune of crashing on this planet.  An alien pops out of each vessel and the race is on.  For one of the aliens the mission is to find and use a key to stop a machine from going off and annihilating all the inhabitants on Earth.  The second alien must stop this from happening because the objective is to remove all the pesky humans from this planet.  Enter Jake Townsend (Jason London) as a screw-up who just wants to find out what happened to his little brother, assigned to the facility housing the secret-special-super-duper key.  What follows is a lot of silliness (not the least of which is a Wild West type of showdown between the aliens on a street in suburbia).  Late in the plot the filmmakers try to cast doubt on which alien is which (helpful, or here to make certain we die).  It's not an entirely successful ploy.  Best of the cast is Lee Horsley as an irascible junkyard owner with a lot of weaponry and some useful information.  Worst of the lot is Mel Fair as Tate the customary bad guy military type who can't be reasoned with thereby putting everyone at risk.  Jason London is Jason London doing Jason London, so if you like what he does, fine, if not......................

A passable sci-fi flick that accomplishes just what it set out to do which is to produce an entertaining TV movie that didn't strain the budget.  It's okay.  At any rate, it was cheap!",1434844800,,1407,4.4921259842519685

8237535,1,B0010AN7QI,Not very good.  Save money and get better ones - time and money will be better spent.,1418601600,,85,4.0
8237536,2,B0010AN7QI,"Being a fan of Lee Horsley, I was very disappointed with this movie. The movie was more than 3/4 over, before Lee Horsely was even seen. Not much of a plot either. Threw away money on this one, I'm afraid.",1404950400,,205,4.15
8237537,5,B0010AN7QI,Great alien movie with lots of action while trying to get rid of the bad alien as there are two of them and the good guys picked the good alien to help.,1392595200,,152,3.78125
