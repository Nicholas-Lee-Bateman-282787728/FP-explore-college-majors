Let's Hope Season Four Isn't Far Behind!!! I Don't Mind The Packaging If It Means More Releases & Faster!!!,1237507200,,279,5.086956521739131
3736807,1,B001OXLGK0,"5 stars, of course, for the series, but at least a -5 stars for the packaging. As others have already stated, all 3 discs are stacked on 1 spindle. This is a capital crime, Sony. There is absolutely no excuse for this kind of shoddy workmanship. If you wanna keep releasing 'em like this, then I'm done with buying 'em.",1237420800,20,319,4.333333333333333
3736808,5,B001OXLGK0,Glad to see Sony is finally releasing more Barney Miller!  One of the finest seasons from a great TV series.,1237420800,,108,4.4
3736809,1,B001OXLGK0,"The Discs are all stacked on a HUB that holds all three discs so they lay on top of each other. Really really cheap packaging from Sony and thise is a mess. I can only guess how many more shows from SONY that will be released this way if they don't get enough complaints. If they were gonna give the consumer less quality they should have lowered the retail price at the same time. Mess of a set release Good Going Sony sounds like someone who came up with this idea needs let go. Qualty products sale and Bad word or mouth on poor packaging etc spreads faster then fire.

Do it Right or forget it!",1237334400,22,598,4.155172413793103
3736810,1,B001OXLGK0,"One of the finest sitcoms of the 70's & early 80's. The show gets five stars hands down. My copy of season three shipped in the poorest packing job the dvd box set Gods ever thought up. It is a spindle with the discs stacked on top of each other. How cheap can you get. This set is a must for Barney Miller fans, but I have already ordered a new case to put the discs in.",1237248000,23,371,3.831168831168831
3736811,3,B001OXLGK0,"Just got my 3rd season today.  When I opened the package I found one DVD.  No flip packaging.  Just one spot for DVDs.  Surprise, surprise discs one, two and three are stacked on top of on another on the same holder.  VERY inconvenient.  Come on Sony, charge a dollar more and give us a space for each DVD.

The three stars is because of the packaging.  I would give the show five stars.",1237248000,10,387,4.205479452054795
3736812,5,B001OXLGK0,"My wife and I have enjoyed Barney Miller since it's inception.
We started recording each ep. when we got our first VHS recorder, and have worn out two complete taped series, then when it again appeared on TV Land,recorded it on SVHS tape again, and after we bought our DVD recorder I began to transfer all our tapes to disc.
During that time we were estatic to see them being relised commercially by Sony, and are currently anxiously awaiting the pre-ordered arrival of the third season.
These are great due to the uncut versions, unlike the syndicated versions which had to be cut to fit the newer time slots.
My only complaint is how long it takes between release between seasons. I can only hope Sony continues to release the entire series.
The writing of this series is supperb, as well as the stars, and guest stars on the show.
The show has substance and continuity, which is severly lacking in todays sitcoms.
I doubt there will ever be another like it in this era.
However having the entire series from Sony would satisfy us for the rest of our lives!",1234915200,27,1059,4.549738219895288
3736813,5,B001OXLGK0,"No release date yet on this, the pivotal 3rd season, where Steve Landesburg becomes a regular as Det. Dietrich. He will eventually replace Det Fish (Abe Vigoda),who officially leaves at the beginning of Season 4 to star in his own (short lived) show. There is an overused phrase used when reviewing TV shows: ""This is where the show 'hit it's stride'"", but if this phrase could ever be used, this is the occasion.

A wonderful show in what may be it's best season, with it's best episode: #11 (Hash). ""By the way that I feel""!

3736884,5,B001OXLGK0,"If you are shopping for the 3rd season of this series then you are likely familiar with the show's premise, the stars and their top-shelf acting and, of course, the outstanding writing - from a bunch of guys who didn't know thing one about being a cop! BARNEY MILLER is, quite simply, one of THE BEST television series EVER to grace the airwaves.  If you are a fan of comedy then it belongs, in its entirety, in your TV show DVD collection.  As such, do yourself a favor and just pony up for the Complete Series from Shout! Factory. You can pick it up used here on Amazon for pretty cheap, which is all the more reason to justify owning the entire series.

Like a lot of burned fans, I bought seasons 1 - 3 of the show never suspecting that the dimwits at Sony would just give up and stop releasing them. These three are in my re-gift box, one day to be given to friends or family. So... ZERO stars for the jerks at Sony, and a rock-solid 5 stars for the show itself. Don't support clueless, uncaring corporate money-grubbers like Sony. Spend you hard-earned money on companies like Shout! Factory, who actually listen to their customers and release shows & films that fans want ...and do right by them by releasing them COMPLETE.",1388016000,,1230,4.433628318584071

I never saw that before.  Why not just ship in an envelope that says please step on?  I guess SONY Pictures figures customers aren't important.  Fine, I'll think twice before purchasing any of their products (TVs, music components, dvds etc).

3736922,5,B001OXLGK0,"The box calls this ""one of the funniest police comedies ever,"" which is faint praise indeed. I can't remember very many police comedies, especially not with a record as long as ""Barney Miller."" This is one of the funniest comedies ever, period. (OK, maybe ""Police Squad"" was funnier, but it only ran for six weeks, not eight years.)

In season 3, this show was just starting to hit its stride. Steve Landesberg's Arthur Dietrich became a recurring character. In season 4, he joined the cast full-time, and added a bit of absurdity that seemed to inspire the rest of the cast. The first two seasons were entertaining, but in season 3 we began to see the sparks of one of the best comedy ensemble casts ever.

Jack Soo's dry delivery as Nick Yemana always cracked me up; he was in good form here, but got even better later. He is missed.",1285200000,,835,4.52317880794702

Sadly it misses a star for the bad packaging and presentation.  Instead of individual mounts or cases for the discs, we get all three in one case and on one mount.  So to get to the last disc you have to take the first two out...this is horrible and increases the chances of the discs getting damaged.  Also, there is no booklet listing the episodes or their titles.  Very poor!

If a job's worth doing...do it right.  Next time, I hope the manufacturers will go back to the designs for either the first or second  seasons, those were much better.",1266537600,8,658,4.425

The answer was always Barney Miller. The mundane duties, the ""regulars"" among the people you dealt with, the camaraderie of the men and women in blue -- Barney Miller got it just right. Barney Miller Complete Third Season ($29.95; Sony) catches the show at a peak, just before Abe Vigoda would leave for his spin-off. Among the terrific episodes is the cast's personal favorite, the one where they all accidentally eat funny brownies and get stoned. One of the all time greats.

3736941,5,B001OXLGK0,"As I today look back at the comedies I enjoyed back in the 1970's, such as ""The Odd Couple"", ""All In The Family"" and ""Maude"", I now notice that I don't think they are as funny I did then. ""Barney Miller"" is the major exception to this, it is still HILARIOUS!  In season three, the show really hit its stride. One reason is that they eliminated the characters of Barney's wife, Liz and Wentworth, the woman police officer.  Almost all the episodes take place within a single set, the squad room.  This barebones setting brings out the best in the writers, just like the movie ""Twelve Angry Men"", one of the finest dramas ever written, takes place almost entirely in the jury room.  This means that it is the dialogue that drives the program, not fancy camera work and elaborate stage settings. In comedy particularly, that is critical.  The presence of the women tended to distract from the the wacky suspects who are brought into the squad room  and who are the true foils and basis for the humor of the show.
The title of this review comes from the especially good two-part episode called ""Quarantine"".  The detectives and other guests are forced to spend the night there due to their possible exposure to a serious infectious disease.  They are all sleeping on cots near each other and Harris starts talking in his sleep. He first says (in a reference to Fish) ""hey man, get out of the bathroom!"". Then (in a reference to Yemana) he says ""lousy coffee.....racing form.....lazy!"".  He then refers to Capt. Miller and says ""Barney...you compassionate turkey!"". Each of the people he is referring to wakes up in turn and ends up looking at him. Harris himself then wakes up and sees everyone looking at him. He says ""how come everybody is up?"". Someone replies ""coincidence!"".
One of the finest comedy shows of all time and it seems to get better and better with the passage of time.",1240876800,2,1882,4.644578313253012
3736942,5,B001OXLGK0,Growing up during this time sitcoms were really starting to hit thier stride. As the seasons progressed the writing the actors found thier personas and the rest is history.,1240444800,,172,4.9655172413793105
3736943,5,B001OXLGK0,"Barney Miller is definitely one of the greatest sitcoms in the history of television. It's also, arguably, the best example of the""ensemble"" sitcom. Not only that, it just might be the closest thing to reality for a police show on television. The writing was excellent, the acting was excellent & its timing was impeccable. There are 22 episodes on three discs.

The set opens with ""Evacuation"" that features Wojo as a disaster preparation officer. He fears that New York City isn't properly prepared & there's no way everyone can be evacuated.

""Quarantine - Part 1"" & ""Quarantine - Part 2"" has the 12th Precinct lock down because of contact with a possible smallpox victim.

""Bus Stop"" finds the detective squad room full of passengers from a hijacked city bus.

""The Election"" centers on some of the detectives' opinions concerning the elections of 1976. In this episode Wojo loses a prisoner after escorting him to an election booth.

""Recluse"" features a doomsayer who is predicting the end of the world @ 5:30 that evening.

""Non-Involvement"" has Wojo bringing a prisoner he's arrested because the man wouldn't aid a woman who's had her purse snatched.

""Power Failure"" puts the 12th Precinct in the dark.

""Christmas Story"" is a multi-layered episode (as all are Barney Miller episodes) that center on Christmas. Yemana gets a date with a ""working girl""; a man can't assemble a present; Fish dresses up as Santa Claus to catch a serial Santa mugger; all the detectives buy Barney a gift after having agreed not to exchange presents; & Inspector Luger is looking to spend Christmas with Barney.

""Hash"" has Wojo bringing in some brownies from a girlfriend that's laced with hash.

""Smog Alert"" causes the 12th Precinct to be concerned about the health of Fish.

""Rand Report"" features a report that is negative toward the police department. Also, because of a shortage of uniformed officers, Wojo is told he must do a week's worth of duty in uniform but walks out instead.

""Fire '77"" has the detective squad bathroom catching fire.

""The Abduction"" features Harris getting angry over a short story of his that has been published in a Men's magazine & has been greatly rewritten.

""The Sex Surrogate"" centers on a neighborhood clinic that's not all it appears to be.

""Moonlighting"" has Harris not doing well after taking a second job to maintain his lifestyle. Also has a priest selling stolen goods.

""Asylum"" features a Russian pianist that wants asylum & a state department employee that has been sent to the 12th.

""Group Home"" is the episode that begins setting up the details for the future & short lived Fish series.

""Strike - Part 1"" & ""Strike - Part 2"" has the 12th Precinct about to go on strike.

It was sad to see Chano (Gregory Sierra) gone without a send off. We can see that Fish is about to retire & go on to a new career as a parent in a group home for troubled children. Dietrich (Steve Landesberg) is not yet a full cast member but has significant roles in some episodes. Also, Officer Leavitt (Ron Carey) is feat ured more often as is Inspector Luger (James Gregory). Barney Miller was a show that wasn't afraid to take on some of the issues of its day but it was never derogatory nor condescending.

It's unfortunate that the packaging is less that desirable. The rating should be docked at least one star because of it but I just couldn't bring myself to do that to such a great show. Hopefully, the fans will make enough noise about this & Sony will reconsider this for he next release. There aren't any bonus features nor any subtitles. The Audio & video are in excellent condition.",1240358400,5,3614,4.7336523125996814
3736944,5,B001OXLGK0,"Barney Miller is one of the all time great television series and by season three, it was really hitting its straps. The introduction of Levit and Dietrich to an already outstanding ensemble cast was just the icing on the cake. Like other reviewers, it's a bit disappointing the 3 cds in this release are just stacked on top of each other but that's a small price to pay for such brilliant writing and acting.

This will promote scratching on the disks - for thoes who like to keep their discs in mint cond. or collectable, this is not good.
It also makes it difficult as to get to the third disc you have to remove the first two. Cheap and inconsiderate design.
The show is great - I find the Video quality transfer bettter than the previous 2 seasons. Although the humor I find has changed slightly in the 3rd season, also the Character Chano is no longer on the show which might have changed the balance?
