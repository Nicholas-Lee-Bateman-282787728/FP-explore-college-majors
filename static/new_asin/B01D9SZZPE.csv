8755261,5,B01D9SZZPE,"I have all 3 videos in this series & would purchase each one again. Although each video can be purchased & used in stand-alone fashion, they do build on one another. Seane is a wonderful, highly experienced, thorough teacher who is well-versed in all 8 limbs of yoga, not only asana practice. If you like her style & are looking to deepen your practice, I highly recommend this series. If you're not familiar with her, check her out for free first on youtube or on various podcasts such as On Being.",1481155200,6,499,4.4945054945054945
