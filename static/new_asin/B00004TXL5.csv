1353100,4,B00004TXL5,One of the best movies of the eighties in my opinion. Overlooked by most but definatley worth releasing on DVD!  PLEASE PUT THIS MOVIE OUT ON DVD!,1227139200,3,146,4.407407407407407
1353101,3,B00004TXL5,"Some would call it a poor man's War Games but I call it fun. A sleeper to most people since it didn't have the appeal of larger production movies like War Games and Short Circuit. Any fans of those movies probably won't be disappointed.

Well worth a couple hours of your time. The premise is some bad guys want to take over the Federal Reserve computer system. While a couple students try to make off with some quick cash from an ATM using their computer skills they discover a plot to destroy the monetary system.

Unfortunately this movie is not available on VHS or DVD in the US at this time. Hopefully someone will put it out on DVD soon. I would much rather watch this than a number of other movies they dredged up to put on DVD.

7923227,5,B00004TXL5,"A brilliant hacker and her boyfriend, killing time in the D.C. 'burbs and ripping off early ATM machines, stumble upon a plot to cripple the global banking industry.

A pretty enjoyable early cyber-thriller, definitely sharing some DNA with War Games, but managing to stand on its own. It does some things I quite liked, and wouldn't have expected in 1985, which were kind of interesting, and it moves along nicely. At a brisk, watchable pace. It's not the most polished thing you'll see, but it's definitely a fun, retro diversion.",1515715200,,532,4.911111111111111

7923230,3,B00004TXL5,"This movie desperately wants to be the next Wargames. But, unfortunately, the director is not up to the task. And the fact that the movie was made on such a low budget doesn't help that either. The FBI office looks like a community college.

There was a good movie here. The idea of a secret organization committing cyber warfare against the U.S. is intriguing  (especially in a 80's movie). There are some good ideas. Kernan Wynn is smarmy as ever. And the movie has a plot that's similar to Die Hard 4.

But I recommend watching DH4 instead.",1480636800,,543,4.520408163265306
7923231,5,B00004TXL5,"Very good hacking movie.  It has several b-movie elements to it (dialog and set design mostly), but the story line is relevant, the guerilla filming style is good, sound editing is good and the characters are likable and cool.  Remember seeing it when I was in college and thought it was surprisingly good.  Found it on amazon 20 years later, and it still holds up.  Not as high-end as War Games, but very respectable.",1459296000,2,418,4.608108108108108
7923232,5,B00004TXL5,wish I could get it on dvd,1418083200,2,26,2.857142857142857
7923233,5,B00004TXL5,"Perhaps it doesn't deserve quite 5 stars, but that's is my way of saying thank you to the owners of the movie and Amazon for making available on digital format for Prime Instant Video after almost twenty-five years of being out of print.  I expect we may see this on DVD soon.  The story is great, casting good, and the effects aren't bad.  This story is still viable in premise even if the computers seem archaic by todays standards.  While trying to rob ATMs two young people find out their is a plot against the government that involves shutting down the Federal Reserve.  Now robbing is a crime period.  So although I get the idea is  hey these two main characters aren't so bad.  Afterall they want to tell the government about this plot to bankrupt it on a large scale.  That is not a good reason to have them rob in order to discover it.  They could have been doing some sort of sound wave monitoring for a science project.  That point made, I still enjoy the movie and would love to see them remake it with current F/X, computers, et cetera.  At the time it was made, in 1984, the equipment was cutting edge.  During that time I was a computer engineer myself and I worked with the same equipment so it piqued my interest.  My mom lived in Catlett, VA when this came out and my dad had a plane a few years before this was made.  My dad and I regularly flew from the Midland Airport while I was working on my pilots license, so a lot of the aerial shots are familiar since some of it was filmed in nearby Culpepper, VA, Maryland, and Washington DC.

7923235,5,B00004TXL5,"It's a shame this movie isn't available on DVD, because I've worn out my copy taped from HBO over 20 years ago.  While not the best film ever made, it goes well with a bowl of popcorn and a rainy Saturday afternoon.  The basic plot centers around an engineering wiz whose talents are ignored because she's female, teaming up with a slow-witted average Joe to hack ATMs for fun and profit.  They inadvertently stumble on a plot to collapse the Federal Reserve, and find themselves on the run from both the criminals and the law.  Definitely worth watching.

Add me to the list of those wishing for a DVD release.",1280534400,2,611,4.5181818181818185
7923236,3,B00004TXL5,"This was made in the mid eighties, the big computers used rolls of tape, the desktop machines had five and a quarter inch floppies, and the whole story is built on mumbo-jumbo and double talk about the magnetic strips on ATM cards being recorded as music and ""spies"" from a foreign power seeking to destroy the United States by an attack on the Federal Reserve System using multiple point electronic jamming.

It's kind of laughable now, and the average second grader can poke holes in it, but it was interesting then and is still kind of fun to watch.  Being a pre 9/11 movie they get to fly a light plane around Washington, DC landmarks, run through real airport terminals, and indulge the ""really smart girl who is also drop dead pretty and a guy who is misguided but really fairly smart"" movie pairing in fun.

It's a romantic thriller comedy, so there is boy and girl stuff, guns, shooting, blowing up stuff, and absurdist leaps of action, but it still easily qualifies for a PG-13 rating-- and might even get a PG today.

Interesting, fun, and a way of looking back at ""those days.""
