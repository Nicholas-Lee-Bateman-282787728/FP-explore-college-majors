1878892,3,B000094J7X,"Aside from the fact there's TOO MUCH SMOKING, and the lead characters could have been prettier, this was a well done movie with a little of everything: love, angst, humor, loss, tragedy, betrayal. If you're not fond of gay love, don't watch it.  Otherwise, it's worth a look.",1194825600,,275,4.729166666666667
1878893,5,B000094J7X,"I really enjoyed this movie. The cover sparked my interest immediately, and the film did not disappoint. I was all smiles from the start (until the very end, naturally). How anyone can look upon the love shared between these two men in disgust (or homosexuals in general for that matter) is beyond me. It's sexy and real and beautiful and sad all in one. And like the director says in the interview available on the disc, it's a story no different than one that can be told between a man and a woman as well. Love is love. Anyway, it's also interesting to learn that the director can relate to both lead characters himself from his own personal experiences with love. And can't we all?",1180137600,2,685,4.488
1878894,2,B000094J7X,"I read many reviews saying this was one of the best gay love stories ever.  great gay movies are extreemly hard to come by.  most are d-movies with horible acting and silly plots and bad filming.  i was told by many that this one was ""different"" its ""fantastic"".  I didn't really like it.  It hardly could keep my attenchion for 5 minutes.  I didn't care if they stayed together at all.  break up?  make up?  be together forever?  more like whatever...will true love conquer all?  maybe in a better movie...",1164672000,3,507,4.522222222222222
1878895,2,B000094J7X,"There are plenty of things to like about this movie, but my expectations for ""Lan Yu"" were several levels higher than any point this flick ever reached.

I do like the ""treatment"" of the female character the older man left Lan Yu to marry -- it was easy to see why a gay man would try going straight to be with her.  Alas, the poor guy was no match for her intellect, and this was made very appparent so that without showing any scenes of their married life I knew why the relationship was doomed from the start, and it wasn't due to his being gay, but due to the fact that he wasn't as astute as was she.  I'm glad she was cast as some pathetic fag hag so desperate for the company of a man that she knowingly tried to swim upstream.  Looked more like she figured a moderately rich but dumb guy who knew he needed her interllectual skills to get them both to wealth was better than a poor man who shared her intellect but would never acquire any of the material things so appreciated by a woman with good tastes.  She would have been age-appropriate for him if not for the fact that he was an adolescent in a middle-aged man's body.  She was certainly better-looking than Lan Yu!

Happily, and unlike with that loathesome ""Eban & Charlie"", things connected up well in Lan Yu, so that little things touch upon early on turned up meaning a lot by the end.  I won't be specific so you will have to enjoy watching it yourself.

I was expecting a more attractive actor for Lan Yu.  Yeah, I know, you say I'm too shallow.  Well, I think if I were an older guy spending money on young bed bunnies, I'd get the prettiest ones my money could buy.  Having adjusted to his seeming penchant for the ""hardworking young student"" type, I was puzzled by his clumsy attempts to make-it with the ""young athlete"" type.  Tell you what though, I got plenty of laughs looking at the body of the guy cast in the ""young athlete"" role:  he looked ridiculous!  Like a little mini-Michelin-man!  Whenever they pick guys with big-yet-soft-and-flabby-features where there should be hard, well-defined muscles, I think the casting woman must have been using too much heroin that day.

The movie was far too sterile for my liking, which is to say that it needed sex or violence to make it interesting.  On the other hand, the men weren't especially attractive, so the lack of sex is a good thing, but they should have made up for it with violence.  Show us the accident, for example.  In fact, show us such an accident early on, then later we'll already know something like that could happen.

Also, I wonder if there's any benefit to showing one side of a phone conversation with a person who is inconsequential to the plot.

The ending put an interesting twist on everything that preceded it, just as it should.

ENJOY this movie by not having high expectations.  In fact, if you want to guarantee you will love this movie more than any other, watch it right after viewing Eban & Charlie.  JOKING -- Only Osama Bin Laden should be made to see that piece of crud.",1139529600,2,3034,4.423423423423423
1878896,5,B000094J7X,"I had no inkling what was in store for my viewing experience when I picked up this DVD out of curiosity at my local public library.  Someone had stolen the case cover, so I was trying to figure out what this movie might be about.  Alas, I can tell you that I didn't expect at all to see full frontal nudity of a man... in a film from China!
Well, strictly speaking this is a Hong Kong production, I suppose, and I'm sure this is an underground cult in Communist China.  I can't imagine ""the butchers of Beijing"" would let this film run publicly, not only because of its homosexuality theme, but because of the backdrop of corruption among the party elite (what's the Russian word for that?) and the Tiananmen Square protests.
Anyway, the movie is surprisingly good.  Some may find the story melodramatic or simple-minded.  But as a non-gay person, I find the plot very easy to follow, the emotions very easy to believe in, and the acting superb.  The actor who plays the title character is simply outstanding.  He exudes both some kind of countryside manhood and yet at the same time a lot of feminine sensitivity.  OK, seriously, I'm not gay, but I was totally drawn into the story and into the characters.  The death of Lan Yu at the end is just very, very sad.
I'd always thought HK movies were cheesy, low-budget flicks aimed at pleasing the after-hour drunkards.  Now I know better.  Stanley Kwan has a masterpiece in Lan Yu.  It's a movie that will touch the hearts of both gay and non-gay viewers.",1065571200,11,1504,4.509225092250922
1878897,5,B000094J7X,"I didn't expect the emotional involvement that I developed during this film.  The only other Chinese directed film I've watched involving a love story between two men was ""The Wedding Banquet"", which I enjoyed tremendously.  This movie, however, I bought on a whim and it payed off!  The story centers around a young architecture student who begins an affair with an older ,successful business man.  Lan Yu, the student, is wooed with dinners, money and many superficial things (none of which are important to him) but eventually has his heart broken by Hangdong, who can't commit to a relationship that he thinks will never last.  He feels that he must commit to a proper marriage with a woman, and after meeting a smart, beautiful woman that fits the bill as the perfect wife, he marries her and ends his relationship with Lan Yu.  Fate, however, brings the two men together some time later after Hangdong has divorced his wife and the two become lovers again but not before Hangdong's job and personal freedom are threatened.  Lan Yu, at this time, proves how deeply he loves Hangdong.  I won't go further into detail about what happens from there nor will I give away the ending.
  ""Lan Yu"" is a very good movie that people, gay or straight, should see. If you want a really good film, a great date movie, or just a really good love story, buy this film.  You will not be disappointed.",1062374400,17,1389,4.651639344262295
1878898,5,B000094J7X,"LAN YU is another indication that films from China are becoming increasingly more poignant, less dependent on spectacle, and certainly more daring in view of the political milieu. Director Stanley Kwan not only has courage to make this poignant film, he also has the gifts to creat an atmospheric, gentle, quiet, and luminously photographed love story.  He draws understated performances from his actors, never stooping to caricature, always respectful of the inherent delicacy of his subject matter.
Lan Yu is a handsome young gay architecture student who becomes involved with Hangdong, a closeted Beijing businessman.  The affair they pursue is subtle yet not without passion, the kind of understated passion that rings true rather than playing for sensationalism.  The plot twists and turns - Lan Yu is set aside by Hangdong for a ""proper marriage"" which leads to divorce and to other losses, bringing Hangdong back to seek his real love - Lan Yu.  The change in their relationship speaks loudly for a wider acceptance of same sex love. To reveal the ending would be a disservice to the viewer.  Part of the joy of this simple story is the sensitivity of Hangdong's colleagues in responding to the his various dilemmas: there  is no ""bad guy"", no prejudice, no castigation - these friends are committed and make homophobia seem merely a foreign, unimportant word.  This film is a model of restraint and intelligent, finely crafted story telling.  The actors are uniformly excellent and win our hearts.  Highly Recommended!",1056499200,,1526,5.120967741935484
1878899,5,B000094J7X,"This was my first viewing of a film by director Stanley Kwan.  I am impressed by his vision and skillful direction.  Hun Ju and Le Yiu (Handong Chen and Lan Yu) are believable as the older, successful businessman, and the young architecture student.  Kwan has managed to take what might otherwise be a tawdry, uneventful story and turned it into a captivating and thoroughly entertaining film.  The sex is understated, but the chemistry between the two men is convincing nonetheless.  I was drawn into the story immediately and captivated until the end.
I usually only watch a movie once, especially foreign, subtitled films, but I look forward with anticipation to watching Lan Yu again.  A real treat for the avid foreign film addict, don't miss this gem, it is a real (and unexpected) treat!",1055635200,4,794,4.888059701492537
1878900,5,B000094J7X,"LAN YU is a beautifully filmed, impressionistic look at a human dilemma: not recognizing what you really want until it's too late. Director Stanley Kwan has made an intelligent film that conveys genuine emotion without theatricality. There is much that rings true in this story for gay men, or anyone, of any age. Based on an incredibly popular 'E-novel' from an anonymous author, Jimmy Ngai's screenplay strikes many true chords and, along with a well-realized mise-en-scene, creates a completely believeable world.
Casting seems ideal. Thirty-something Hangdong is played with great range by Jun Hu, and he looks convincing in the part as well. Playing Lan Yu, who ages from late teens into twenties, is remarkable Ye Liu. The men meet as part of a transaction: money for sex, paid by wealthy Hangdong. The sex scenes are presented with honesty, sensuality and without ambiguity. Yet, early on, it becomes clear to both that more is going on than physicality. For a short time, they pursue a relationship. Then everything is altered by choices made by one of the men. The main part of the film, told as a memory, is the playing out of the consequences of his choice. If these characters were heterosexual, the film's plot might be dismissed as hackneyed. But with the added dynamic of male/male relations in a homophobic world and with Kwan's dream-like, often poetic directing style, we have something ultimately original and worth experiencing.
The film is presented letterboxed on the DVD and it looks very good. The often rich textures of the image come across beautifully. Also on the disc: a video interview with the director and four trailers for other gay-interest films.
LAN YU has real emotional impact and sensuality. It deserves a wide audience.",1053734400,34,1759,5.027397260273973

7989218,5,B000094J7X,Great movie. I remember meeting the star playing Lan Yu years ago here in NYC. It is a movie I have watched over and over.,1445731200,,122,3.92
7989219,5,B000094J7X,"This is one of my favorite more real life gay movies ever. This movie always resonates a great deal with me on many levels and I find I really enjoy it. It's a much more real account of a gay man's life, the adversity he faces and creates, all the while failing to realize that he has inadvertently found his man and taking him years and many failures to realize that he already found the love of his life and should have been loving him instead of worrying about appeasing society. He takes years to realize that it isn't money, power, sex, or any of that that makes you happy its finding someone to love, who loves you back that defines and ends up saving his life.
The only element of this movie that I don't like is the ending, which I never watch as I kind of, feel like it was just tacked on there in the standard Asian theme of gay guys dying alone and heart broken or something. Other than the ending, I think it's a great movie.",1444694400,,937,4.18232044198895
7989220,3,B000094J7X,"This is a significant Chinese film in so many ways: To begin with, it's one of a few major gay-themed productions with big stars in it. Second, even though it's considered a Taiwanese production, it's filmed in Beijing with actors from more conservative Mainland China; they certainly took some risks to be in a gay-themed film with not only some homoerotic scenes, but also a story that acknowledges the 1989 Tiananmen Protest.

Nevertheless, why did I only give this product a 3-star rating? It's simply because of the quality of this DVD. The first time I saw this film, I was in China, and because the film was censored there, I had to see the full cut on a pirate DVD. Pirate DVDs in China can look really legit. They don't just get a random copy of an official release and rip it; they gather the best sources of a film's global releases and put the best picture, sound, subtitles together. This official US release, however, has a lot of problems with the picture.

1) The film is presented in letterbox format, which means on a current widescreen TV, you will see black bars all around the film frame.

2)They used a very rough source for this DVD. Some scene transitions looked really stiff, and a mysterious white stripe would appear on the left side of the film frame towards the end of the film!

3)The sound was OK, but shockingly it wasn't quite in sync with the picture at the beginning of the film. The same problem happened to the English subtitles. (I guess you'd only find that out if you speak Mandarin.)

Therefore, buy this product with caution if you really don't have an all-region player, but if you do, get the Region 2 French release. (It's the main source of the pirate DVD I saw in China.)",1421193600,3,1718,4.529032258064516

7989222,4,B000094J7X,"Have to say the best thing about this movie was the acting, hands down. The movie (and I guess the novel it was based on?) knows its focus, so we get a tender story about love and timing. The story's not perfect- there's a want of more characterization for supporting roles, more insight into Lan Yu's family situation, Chen's friends' lives and more info on the big time-gaps that are left, but big as those faults sound on paper you still don't really care. The story knows what it's about, and the actors give great convincing performances. definitely a tear jerker. as an American viewer i guess I also found interesting how the film used life in the States and possibility there as a plot device, so that we get the American dream and its forms showing up in Beijing during a time of economic transformation to inform the plot from a few different angles. anyway i'm glad i watched it.",1294012800,,890,4.53416149068323
7989223,5,B000094J7X,"To quote Ursula from the Little Mermaid ""Lifes full of tough choices, isn't it?"". It was just as simple yet heartbreaking and romantic. The student finally got the business man to see another side of love and even had him free himself of the closet torture but only for it to be broken into pieces. If you like movies like this, try Bangkok Love story or Second Skin",1265500800,,366,4.397058823529412
