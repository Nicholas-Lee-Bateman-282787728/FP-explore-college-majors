8687885,4,B00PH9IJLQ,"Love Shania singing, the Las Vegas spectacular - spectacular thing, no so much. I felt sorry for the people in the theater, too much going on while she is singing.  But, that just Vagas for you I guess, everything over the top.",1431302400,,227,4.404761904761905
8687886,5,B00PH9IJLQ,Great show and great behind the scenes section,1430697600,,46,4.875
8687887,4,B00PH9IJLQ,This was a very solid performance and comeback. She performed most of her biggest hits and I would highly recommend adding this to your music collection if you like Shania Twain's music.,1430006400,,186,4.84375
8687888,3,B00PH9IJLQ,"I really like Shania and most of her music is great. I don't mind the songs being old, liked them then still like them now.this is almost exclusively for the director/editor or whomever thought that the idea that a cut away every few seconds was a good one. Now when i buy live shows its because i want to feel like i am kind of at the concert. (only with better seats than i can usually afford) This has NONE of that for me. how can i feel like i am there when ok were looking at Shania (2 seconds).. wait now its the band (2 seconds) now we are suddenly in the balcony (2 seconds) now we are falling from the balcony and watching the audience (2 seconds)  now i am 6 inches from her face (2 seconds) anyways i hoped it would get better as the show went on but was that way pretty much the whole time. i can put the dvd on and listen to it but watching it just makes me dizzy. which also kinda sucks cause i already have the cds. Anyways 10 stars for Shania, but - 7 for the in my opinion completely unwatchable video. Would have really loved to see the show even the cheap seats would have had a better focus for me.",1429920000,2,1118,4.013452914798206
