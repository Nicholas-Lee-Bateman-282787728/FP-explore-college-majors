7908568,5,B00000FEFK,"Nemec follows the vicissitudes of two Jewish teenagers who escape from a Nazi deportation train and attempt to survive. The opening images showed the nameless pair sprinting desperately through a field, fleeing a pack of invisible pursuers as gunshots echo in the near distance. The effect is startling. Its as if the film has been playing for an hour already and we were just now snapping back into focus as the jittery hand-held camera is provoking the dreams and visions of their semi-feverish state.
 On one hand the film seemed to be playing out inside their heads; on the other, the present dangers were poignantly real. We trek with them through the forest, chance run-ins with local farmers, tram-car escapes, encounters with childhood sweethearts, the discovery of a swarm of ants crawling on an eye socket or a hand  some present, some past, some real, some imagined, and some alternate versions of the same events.
 Theyre captured by old Home-Guardists on a charge of stealing bread and sentenced to a firing squad. These degenerate old men burst into a gluttonous song-and-dance routine in the presence of the emaciated captives, permanently collapsing the blurred boundary between their inner and outer lives. As the villagers have no real stomach for killing they enact a mock execution. The film concludes more or less where it began, only now the forest has been transformed from a site of literal, life-or-death struggle to a kind of shadowy mental theatre.",1433376000,,1475,5.036885245901639
7908569,5,B00000FEFK,"Made in 1964 this was a film that has more than stood the test of time. It opens with two Jewish boys running from a train transport somewhere in Germany. They are running for their lives and the film captures the sheer fear and desperation perfectly. Using camera techniques that take you with them rather than as a voyeur you are transported with them to their plight. The hand held camera is often used to show in graphic detail the hardships they go through.

They are starving, wet and cold - add to this the exhaustion and fear and you can feel only pity for these two lads. The film also uses flash backs and dream sequences to things that may or have happened and repeated visuals of nightmares and glimpses of what might have been. Instead of acting as an alienation device though, these techniques help to explore the complex feelings and mind sets of the boys.

At only 68 minutes long it does seem to fly by but it is a film you will remember long afterwards. In some scenes the boys have the letters `KL' painted on their backs. I tried to find out what this was referencing and I think it indicated that they were inmates of the concentration camp at Krakov - this would fit with them being transported to another camp which is the film's back story. This is a brilliant, stark, moving and exceptional piece of film making that I can highly recommend to cinema history fans.",1430524800,,1388,4.460629921259843

7908571,5,B00000FEFK,"""Diamonds of the night"" was the first full-lenght movie from czech filmmaker Jan Nemec and as many of the films that conformed the Prague Spring the movie is a perfect synthesis of different artistic movements ( expresionism, surrealism, neorrealism ) and techniques, with a strong influence of documentary films. The film is based on a novel of the jewish czech writter Arnold Lustig and follow the vicissitudes of two jewish teenagers who escape from a nazi deportation train and their attempts of surviving . Nemec is not interested so in the narration as to implicate the spectators in the experiences of the protagonist couple through the fabrication of an identity close to the mental state of both ( for example: with the support of subjective camera ). Nemec has compared the movie with Tarkovski's "" Ivan's childhood "" due to in the film the reality is constantly sublimated through the dreams and visions provocated by the semi-fevirish state of the two fugitives, in a kind of poetic realism. Nemec's motivations in placing the viewer in the skin of the two boys occupies a central role in the film since from a metaphysical point of view the film shows the struggle that everyone must choose along his life for freedom.

A very beautiful film for a very, very expensive price.",1154908800,5,1288,4.8812785388127855
