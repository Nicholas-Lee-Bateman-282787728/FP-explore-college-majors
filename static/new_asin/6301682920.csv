The film is ornamented with graphic vitality through visual metaphors and explicit description of the existential singleness. If not for the existence of a radio there would be a true absence of connection with the outside world.

The real time elapses since 1978. The football match Holland-Argentine places us in context , and the documental style allows to establish there is a coup d' etat and the military oppression begins to blow. In this state of things our schoolteacher decides to make a gentle bond between Veronico and his unknown father in real presence due he keeps an old photo simply.

But these good intentions work out as a nave attempt. Because the reality will have for him another surprise, that eventually will be a boomerang, due he is transferred to another village.

Four years have passed and The Malvinas Affair will emerge as dramatic catapult that will seal the fate of this simple boy who lived too fast, hoping something from the life.

Poignant movie, meticulously made.",1116806400,2,1090,5.005524861878453

The movie takes place in Argentina and it is quickly obvious that the story is taking place in one of the outposts of civilization. This is far away from the cosmopolitan European world of Buenos Aires. The time period for the movie is the nineteen seventies and eighties, a time of change in the government. This is an interesting story told with the two main characters, Veronico Cruz and ""el maestro"" as the vehicle of expression. A pretty good tale as told through the eyes of a naive young boy and his more worldly friend , ""el maestro."" The cinematoghraphy is shot with realism and reflects the harshness of the environment, often with panoramic views and beautiful imagery. The movie is about a young boy who is abandoned by his father early in life and the hardships he overcomes. ""El maestro"" is a sort of surrogate father to him, who not only teaches him about the world outside of his remote corner of the world, but actually shows him and helps him explore. The two have a good relationship but it is interrupted by the political changes taking place in the country. This was a time of military coups and a restriction of peoples freedoms and often those that did not comply would never be seen again. The movie deals with the realities of change in government in Latin America with a degree of subtlety as there is no violence and the message is conveyed through the changes taking place with the characters. This is a good movie for those interested in Latin American history or the politics of Argentina during the seventies. It is also good for understanding the differences in cultures and the perceptions of those less fortunate. Don't expect a Hollywood production, this was shot on a shoe string budget to get a message out, limited production extras but strong on reality. Be warned it is not the most uplifting movie, it is as often happens, an ultimately sad story.",978480000,12,1971,4.68299711815562
