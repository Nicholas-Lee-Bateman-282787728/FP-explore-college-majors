Are you a person who likes complex plots, romantic storylines, unexpected twists, and endearing or villainous characters?  If you enjoy the above, you should avoid this movie at all costs, for your mind cannot grasp the depths of John Giancaspro's character, Harry Russo.  I think it takes a sick person with a bizarre sense of humor and/or a user of hallucinogenic substances to enjoy Russo's depravity and consistent mangling of the English language.  His horrendous misogyny is outweighed by this, as he refers to women consistently as ""hoo-ahs,"" which is apparently Jerseyspeak for a woman of ill repute.

Random scenes appear throughout this movie.  Russo is seen jumping up and down in a parking garage, fully naked from the waist down, and wears makeup and clothing reminiscent of Dee Snider from Twisted Sister.  This is contrasted by the kindly old lady (the only one Russo likes) that runs the adult video store and offers newscasters nips of liquor from a flask.

You will laugh, you will cry; although you will cry from laughing so hard rather than empathy for a character or a genuinely sad moment.  I have no idea what the plot of this movie was, and it is probably for the better.  I could not have such wonderful memories of ""Schizophreniac: The Whore Mangler"" if I fully understood what it was about.

Overall, I recommend this movie to adults who are mentally prepared to witness an extravaganza of completely random scene cuts.  For those who think more linearly, you will not understand the artistic genius of this movie and should probably stick to critically-acclaimed movies such as ""Schindler's List"" or ""Star Wars.""",1309305600,2,1871,4.882911392405063

Also the film for those who enjoy watching a man stand on a building naked and say he's going to kill all the minorities/the world.",1174521600,4,255,4.12
