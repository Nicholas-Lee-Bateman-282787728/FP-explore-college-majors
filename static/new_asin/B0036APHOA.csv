8389710,4,B0036APHOA,Both great movies for my kids - though I do think firehouse dog is a bit scary with the fire scene for younger kids.  It's nice to have wholesome movies for boys that don't rely on burping to get through the film and tell great stories.,1455321600,,236,4.130434782608695

8389712,5,B0036APHOA,"baseball fans will love this movie -- we're Red Sox fans but this story about Babe Ruth and the Yankees is great.

firehouse dogs is a good movie too but can't top Everyones Hero",1292284800,3,178,4.235294117647059
