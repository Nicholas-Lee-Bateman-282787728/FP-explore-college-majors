6789270,1,B00P8KD29I,"This latest Tinker Bell installment from the animated Barbie series has really begun to show its age and the audiences are starting to lose interest. So much so, that I believe that this may be the beginning of the end of the Tink.
As an online certified volunteer therapist worker for a Vanessa's Boys R Us Ranch here in California, I have the opportunity to work with some of the most hardened youth. Many of whom are unfortunately from broken fatherless homes, if ever there was one. As a result, they continue on a cycle of self-destruction. It also makes them emotionally vulnerable to positive reform from a fatherly figure such as I. It is simply a matter of discovering how to pull them away from their destructive gang mentality and guiding them towards a more constructive approach to life.
For movie night in the tent, I brought this Tinker Bell movie, Jiffy Pop and (lite) beer. All of which were promised if they behaved during the week.
What followed once the movie started is sort of a blur because it all happened so fast. The tent was destroyed along with the campsite and several acres of the forest burned down. No small task given snow-covered ground in the middle of the winter. Additionally, I had to walk home ten miles to my cabin trailer because they slashed the tires to my Toyota Prius again.
While I have had better luck with the boys over the years with other Tinker Bell movies, this is one that I cannot honest recommend.",1419897600,34,1452,4.588461538461538
6789271,5,B00P8KD29I,"Improving upon the past movies.  Having seen scenes from the movie and ever since the trailer I knew this would be just as good as the first five tinker bell movies.  Fawn is the center of the story and you can see immediately that the animation is better, and the characters who are at this point are so well developed flow through their parts in the story almost as if they were real.  Every tinker bell movie including this one should have gone to theaters in the U.S. (Not just the uk) because they are all theatre worthy.  A+ quality.  I have all five of the tinker bell movies and they all have been wonderful Classic movies and I would buy this even without a trailer cause I trust Disney at this point completely.",1415923200,75,721,4.350746268656716

6789303,4,B00P8KD29I,"When looking at Disneys Tinker Bell series as a single body of work, many themes and patterns begin to surface, revealing hints into the mindset of the developers.  First they went the way of the seasons, delivering four climate-fueled adventures.  Once that angle had been exhausted, it seems the move has been made to focus on individual fairies per film.  Given one look at the cast of characters Disney has to work with here and it becomes clear this could be a very, very long series indeed.

That being said, in this case animal lover fairy Fawn gets the spotlight in a tale that alternates between present day activities and a myth from deep fairy lore that seems to be coming to pass all around the residents of Pixie Hollow.

Before getting into the story itself, lets take a look at the performance of the film via some hard numbers.  Released domestically as a direct-to-DVD affair in March of 2015, Legend of the Neverbeast bears the distinction of being the most recent entry to the franchise at the time of this reviews writing.  Disney has confirmed that a seventh entry was underway to follow this one but had been canceled due to story issues.

Disney has been very quiet about the operating budget on the piece but there is little reason to suspect it would be too far off the average mark of the five films in the franchise that preceded it; $35-million a pop.  If this is accurate, a UK theatrical run nearly recovered the budget (taking in $31.2-million at the box office) even before any domestic release activity.  This leads one to suspect that the project was lucrative financially though a lack of confirmed profits and yet still no announcement on that canceled follow-up film don't bode well.

Back to the movie at hand, titular character Tinker Bell finds herself relegated to supporting cast status this time around as Steve Loters animated saga instead focuses its attention on Fawns (voiced by Ginnifer Goodwin) love for the critters of the forest- yes even those who are terrible threats to fairy-folk like hawks and mythical monsters.

When the arrival of a strange comet spurs the awakening of an animal thats equal parts armadillo, opossum and monster of the Maurice Sendak's Wild Things variety, Fawn finds herself on the sneak tip while an elite fairy security team (who are admittedly cool in so sterile a mythos) do what they can to locate and nullify the threat.

While previous entries of the franchise seemed to be inching ever-closer to linking the Pixie Hollow universe to the Peter Pan series that spawned the character of Tinker Bell, NeverBeast seems to have taken a deliberate step back and to instead give fans something closer to the type of fantasy-driven lesson about judging a book by its cover in the tradition of How to Train Your Dragon.

All in all the formula works.  There are times this series as a whole feels as though its struggling to find its niche but NeverBeast accomplishes what it sets out to do fairly well.  With a 76-minute run-time and pacing that comes together nicely by the end (the beginning drags out a bit), kids will surely enjoy the romp despite a fairly melancholic ending.

While the fate of the franchise itself is yet uncertain, Legend of the NeverBeast leaves its viewer satisfied with the knowledge that Pixie Hollow itself is safe and in good hands should Disney decide to pay it a revisit in the future.",1486512000,,3393,4.743197278911564

6789335,5,B00P8KD29I,"Let me start this review by saying that I am a grown man who typically enjoys action and horror films, alongside heavy metal music. That said, I was absolutely captivated by this offering from Disney. So, when I popped online to see others' opinions on the film, I was dismayed to see how many folks panned this film as being a ""downer,"" or according to one reviewer, ""dark and twisted."" So, from the objective standpoint of one who is usually not into this sort of thing, let me try and dispell some of the confusion and concern for potential viewers, be they children, parents watching with children, or just odd adults like myself.

THE PLOT:

  Spoilers ahead. You've been warned. In this film, the animal-talent fairy named Fawn encounters a strange and injured creature in the forest. Because of her reputation for bringing dangerous creatures into Pixie Hollow, due to her empathetic nature, Fawn resolves to keep this large, mysterious, and intimidating beast hidden from the Scout fairies, who are already unhappy with Fawn's prior antics involving a hawk. The beast, whom Fawn names Gruff, has a tendency to gather and stack rocks, thus shaping large towers of stone. Fawn helps in this activity, partially for fun, and partially to satiate her curiosity about Gruff's intentions once his towers are done.
  Meanwhile, Nyx, the stern leader of the Scout fairies, begins combing through fairy lore for references to Gruff, whom she only knows as the menacing shape she's seen glimpses of in the wilderness. At last, she finds that this creature is known as the NeverBeast, who awakens every thousand years to call down a massive storm with his great stone towers, and thus destroy Pixie Hollow. What ensues is a tumultuous, catastrophic sequence of events wherein even Fawn begins to doubt Gruff's gentle nature, when indeed the storm does arrive as foretold, and Gruff takes on a horned and winged form. But, in the end, it is revealed that Gruff is not the cause of the storm. In fact, he awakens every thousand years to absorb the energy of the storm, and thus keep Pixie Hollow safe. In a daring flight, he and Fawn manage to halt the storm, but Fawn is left near death, and Gruff revives her with stored up electrical energy from his body, restarting her heart. It is only then, once the fairies have come to know and love Gruff, that they realize he is utterly exhausted and must now go back into hibernation until the next storm comes, which will be in another thousand years. They will never see him awake again; by the time he awakens, they will all be dead. Each fairy, including the Scouts, thanks Gruff for his service, and Fawn bids her friend a last, tearful goodnight.

THE POINT:

  The meaning of this film is multifaceted, and surprisingly poignant for a movie whose suggested viewing age is 4 years-old. First and foremost is the classic, but always welcome, moral that one should never judge a person's heart based on their appearance. The large and intimidating Gruff is a kind soul, who puts himself in harm's way to protect even those fairies that fear him. Meanwhile, Nyx the Scout Captain seems like a hard-headed bully, but it is imperative to remember that she is doing her job in the way she truly believes is best. She is not a villain, nor is Gruff. There are no ""evil"" people here, just mixed priorities, miscommunication, and dangerous presumptions that set good people (or fairies, as the case may be) at odds, even though they all have good intentions.
  A secondary, but no less powerful moral, is the notion of sacrifice and loss. This film will make young viewers, yet unfamiliar with loss, ask some serious questions. With Fawn's near-death experience, and Gruff's one thousand year-long hibernation, children will have a few curious inquiries about what it means that by the time Gruff awakens, all of the fairies he knew will be gone. There will be teary eyes and sniffles for many viewers, myself included. But the concepts that this film leads young viewers to consider are utterly worthwhile, and they're packaged in a delightful, amusing story that will bring more smiles than tears, and that will definitely be on repeat in some households for quite a while yet.

BOTTOM LINE:

  This film is not dark or scary. There is a definite tone-shift after the first fifteen minutes or so, wherein the plot goes from a lighthearted frolic to a meaningful conflict of wills, but that is nothing to fear. If you are willing to take the time to sit with your children, watch this film, and answer the serious questions it may spark, then Legend of the NeverBeast will become a family favorite in no time at all!",1470182400,,4654,4.762732919254659

6789390,5,B00P8KD29I,"This has become one of my family's favorite Tinkerbell movies! I love all the Tinkerbell movies, I'm a huge fan and so are my two daughters. While I love the character Tinkerbell, I also love the other fairies and love the movies that focus on them and tell their stories.

This movie focuses on Fawn, the animal fairy. It's a great story, somewhat sad at times. But, it tells a wonderful message. This movie of the Tinkerbell and fairy franchise introduces you to Fawn and her huge heart. Fawn's personality is very reminiscent of Tinkerbell herself, full of determination and wit. Fawn has a soft spot for all animals, even those who are considered dangerous to fairies. Fawn thinks all animals need and deserve love and help regardless of species or danger posed. She tends to get into predicaments because of this, often drawing the attention of the scout fairies and the queen.

The scout fairies are charged with protecting Pixie Hollow. The scout fairies are led by Nyx (voiced by Rosario Dawson). Nyx is the complete opposite of Fawn. She's a very practical and stern fairy who takes her job with the utmost seriousness. She will definitely make you frustrated at times.

Fawn discovers a mysterious creature that she just can't quite figure out. Of course her heart swells with love for the beast and she's determined to protect him while Nyx is focused on capturing him and ridding Pixie Hollow of this unknown creature. Danger surrounds the Neverbeast. As legend tells, whenever he shows up, Pixie Hollow is in great danger at risk for complete destruction. Evey 1000 years all of Pixie Hollow, each fairy and all they accomplish, is at great risk. Is the Neverbeast here to save Pixie Hollow and it's wonderful inhabitants? Or is the Neverbeast the one who will destroy Pixie Hollow beyond repair?

The graphics in this movie are amazing. The colors change with the mood and tone of the scenes. This is a visually amazing movie and a story with great heart. The music and soundtrack are beautiful, much different than the other movies. The songs are peaceful and and uplifting. You and your children will definitely enjoy this movie. Just make sure to get out the tissues if you're of a softer heart.

Shipping was fast, disc arrived in excellent condition. Was purchased new.",1458777600,2,2288,4.811704834605598

6789429,5,B00P8KD29I,"When Tinkerbell started gaining popularity, I was confused. She had such a rotten personality in ""Peter Pan,"" after all. Ah, but Disney often ""refurbishes"" characters/storylines/etc to... well, to sell more merchandise, really. I wasn't interested in this practice. But my daughter turned out to be far more ""girly"" than I ever was; she loves anything to do with princesses, mermaids, the color pink, and, of course, fairies. So when she spotted one of the Tinkerbell movies on Netflix we just *had* to watch it. It was... not terrible, not great, but okay. She enjoyed it and I could tolerate it enough to let her watch the others available. Well, I recently spotted and decided to check out ""Neverbeast"" for her from the library. And I'm so glad I did!

Fawn is a far more likable fairy than even ""revamped""-Tink, in my opinion. Her dedication to the understanding and well-being of animals is a great example (maybe even inspiration) to children. Her relationship with the Neverbeast was well done; he was big (huge to a fairy!) and scary-looking when Fawn found him, and he was also suffering from a thorn in his paw. She tried to help him and he chased her away, but she persisted in aiding him. She endeavored to study him, despite his ferocious appearance, and slowly gain his trust and acceptance. There was, of course, the customary misunderstanding/second-guessing-yourself/jumping-to-conclusions dilemma before all was happily resolved and ""Gruff"" was proven to be a fierce-looking but ultimately gentle-giant hero. The fairies greatly enjoyed his company before he, shall we say, retired from public life.

Our entire family enjoyed this film. It kept our son's attention, my husband admitted to being ""a bit choked up"" at the end, and our daughter displayed remarkable compassion during the credits when she looked at me (a bit past merely ""choked up,"" I admit) and said, ""It's okay, Mama. Gruff's only napping! And he's got a bed and nightlight now... (she patted my shoulder then turned to her father) Daddy! You should get Mama a Gruff for Christmas!""

So he did. :)",1450828800,2,2082,4.994236311239193

The Secret of the Wings is probably their best one and the ones before it were pretty good.  I was a little disappointed with this one and the Pirate Fairy one.

Anyway the story isn't about Tinkerbell, it's about her buddy ""Fawn"".  Fawn loves animals and stumbles upon a creature that looks a lot like a ""Sha"" from the World of Warcraft: Mists of Pandaria.  So if I were to re title this film for accuracy I would call it Fawn and the Sha of Lightning. I liked the story but I thought the sidekicks were racist and the design of the beast was too much like Sha and the Luck Dragon from The Never Ending Story.",1442016000,,634,4.3559322033898304

It is a story in which she plays a part but is much more about a sister fairy and her discovery of ancient history for the fairy land.  Once over that the story is good.  We fast-forwarded through two parts of more ""scary"" action for a 4 yr old, but not a lot of that was necessary.  Good places to talk very briefly about stuff!

Sure the child audience it is aimed at is older kids but with a great story line, good musical tunes, and lots of action sequences it is definitely a movie for the whole family.",1436659200,,480,4.311111111111111

6789593,1,B00P8KD29I,"This movie was just awful. I don't understand all the four and five star ratings for it, unless those  reviews are from people who enjoy watching animal cruelty and suffering, plus watching little kids get upset because the movie makes it look like the neverbeast dies at the end.

The neverbeast is basically like a big cat and is put through one physically hurtful thing after another. The movie becomes a masochism tango as the fairies join in by drugging him, chasing him down with weapons and restraining him. Along the way viewers are made to think fairies are dead as the neverbeast is shown in agony as lightning strikes him and he grows horns and wings. At the end he goes to sleep for a thousand years and there is a funeral procession. This is too much for little kids.

The Tinkerbell movies used to be good. They were never intense, they taught good values and you knew a kid could watch it. This was a big fat piece of crap and the older kids knew it. The younger ones cried and told me they never wanted to see it again. I cant say as how I blame them. Im never going to trust Disney again, and Im going to pre-screen their junk just like I do everything else.

Im 44 years old. People my age have a tendency to drop dead for no apparent reason. I don't have time or money to waste on scary movies for my nieces and nephews that will scare them and make them cry. There is maybe 5 minutes of Tinkerbell in it, only one male character and we never get to see how the Pixie Hollow Defense Force works. Add to that the animal cruelty and making the kids cry, and its hard to understand how anyone could like this movie.

People who say this movie is good HAVE to be lyingtheres no other explanation. Supposedly this is the last Tinkerbell movie. If they ever do another one, they had better stay away from the heavy hitting subject matter. Im not buying their crap anymore.",1435622400,3,1885,4.328611898016997

6789597,1,B00P8KD29I,"Let me first start this post by stating that I love Disney.  I've been to Disney World twice and can't wait to take my daughter one day soon.  With that said, I am extremely disappointed and a little angry at Disney right now and now I wonder if Disney gone too far?

It started last Friday.  Madelyne and I LOVE the Tinkerbell movies. We've watched The Pirate Fairy a zillion times and will probably watch it a zillion more.  The music, the friendships, the happy endings, leave Madelyne and I singing and quoting lines from the movies.  So when the newest Tinkerbell movie came out (pre-ordered since January) we couldn't wait to watch it.  Unfortunately after watching it, Madelyne doesn't ever want to see it again - and I don't blame her.

From the very beginning, Gruff (the Neverbeast) was a little scary.  He has huge green eyes, the body of a cat, and a reptile tail.  But like Fawn the fairy, Madelyne loves all creatures and has been cuddling with her Gruff stuffed animal since we got it back in January.

SPOILER ALERT!

Basically this is how the movie goes:  Gruff awakes after 982 years of hibernation, Fawn loves him and doesn't think he's so bad, Gruff is supposed to destroy Pixie Hollow, he grows horns and batwings, he roars, there's a huge thunder and lightening storm, the fairies all think they are going to die, Fawn actually DOES die until Gruff brings her back to life, and just when all the fairies fall in love with Gruff, he goes back into hibernation for another 982 years, which means that the fairies will never see him again.

Sounds lovely, doesn't it?  As we were watching the movie, Madelyne, who very rarely cries even when she gets a shot at the Doctor's office, cried.  A lot.  First, she was terrified of the storm because it was scary.  Then she cried when she thought Fawn died because Fawn is her favorite fairy.  THEN she cried after the movie was over because she was never going to see Gruff again.  At that moment, she threw her stuffed Gruff out of the bed and has refused to sleep with him since then.

My question to Disney is why?  Why did they have to make this latest Tinkerbell movie scary and sad while the others have been funny and happy?  Tinkerbell and Neverland are supposed to be happy.  Madelyne and I are supposed to feel happy after a Tinkerbell movie but as far as we're concerned, that movie is going in the garbage.

Also, which I found curious, is that Disney completely changed Fawn's look.  In the previous four movies, she's had a long braid, no make-up and wears a shirt and pants.  Let' put it this way - in the group of girl fairies, she would probably be the butch lesbian.  Nothing wrong with that.  She's tough and hardcore and could definitely kick my ass in a fight.  But in the new movie, suddenly she is wearing a tiny skirt, knee-high boots and a ton of make-up.  Why did Disney suddenly change Fawn's image from a down-to-earth fairy to a sexpot fairy?  Are they targeting kids or adults who have a fairy fetish?

What happened to a fun cartoon movie with a happy ending?  A lot of movies have endings that leaves the audience bursting out in uncontrollable sobbing.  (Titanic anyone?  Damn it Rose, there was room on the freaking raft!)  But you could always count on Disney for a pick-me-up movie that leaves the audience smiling and happy.

Hopefully, the latest Tinkerbell movie is a fluke and won't happen again.  Disney, please bring back happy fairies and leave out the scary parts.  Let's pretend that this movie never happened.  At least, that's what we're going to do.  In the meantime, for tonight's movie and sleepover night, we're watching The Pirate Fairy for the zillionth and one time because it's funny, happy, and definitely NOT scary.",1435536000,3,3736,4.57315233785822

But I didn't need worry...this is now a favorite for us, especially my littlest girl! She loves Gruff! It is a little more serious than the other Fairy movies but I watched with my girls and we talked about how Gruff was going to sleep for a long time (not dying) and it made his fairy friends sad that they wouldn't see him again.  My girls understood right off that Gruff was good and misunderstood and trying to protect Pixie Hollow (or as my littlest says ""Gruff good, Scout bad!).  I can see where this would depend on the child though; I recommend watching with your young kids at first to gauge their reaction.

6789645,5,B00P8KD29I,"This latest installment to the Tinkerbell/Disney Fairies series is a wonderfully profound and worthy installment.  However, even so, this will probably be the most divisive film of the franchise due to its darker (perhaps ""heavier"" is the better word) tones.

CONTENT ISSUES: Like all the other Tinkerbell films, there really isn't anything particularly offensive or objectionable.  I wouldn't be afraid to show this film to my young nieces and nephews at all.  But, as i stated before, this film takes on a heavier tone than the prior installments...and I know there are some parents that can be sensitive to this as it relates to their children.  THE FIRST, and most obvious, comes with the introduction of the Scout Fairies (and my most favorite new inclusion to the lore).  They literally serve as the combat-capable guardians of Pixie Hollow.  This means the violence is more direct (and much more serious than the comedic violence of ""The Pirate Fairy"").  In fact, one of the first major events you see in the film is them combatting hawks that are trying to feast on the fairies and friendly animals.  No, they don't typically aim to kill or destroy the the threat...but they aren't shy about using a bit of force to deflect a threat.  They utilize combat staves (what would be toothpicks to us), what are essentially sleeping gas bombs, bows and arrows, nets, bola snares and other things like that.  Some may see this as strange, but it's really not.  If you go back to the books, there was a fairy known as Winda Quickwing who is considered a mighty heroine amongst the fairies.  She and her army fought off an army of ants/wasps bent on taking Pixie Hollow away from the fairies.  She even lost her life in the process.  Still, some parents may be ok with this, some may not.  THE SECOND thing that may give parents pause is that the main beast of this film looks scarier than prior antagonistic creatures of the past films.  There's actually a good reason for this which is explained in the bonus features (and that gives it greater significance), but it may be scarier for kids.  Though to be honest, this factor is very important to the plot...and without it, the tale would lose a lot.  THE THIRD AND FINAL POINT is that a lot of this film is bittersweet, emotionally mature and tugging at the heartstrings.  I personally think that's a good thing, but that's just my opinion on that.

TO THE FILM...ABSOLUTELY NO PLOT SPOILERS:

Themes:
Thematically, this film is the most sophisticated of the films, thus far.  Not only does it have the courage to deal with issues of mortality, misunderstanding, and sacrificial courage, but it does so with an intelligent use of simplicity without dumbing down.  One thing I've learned with working with kids is that they want people to take them seriously...and this film honors them and that basic desire.  Not only that, but though the premise of the plot is simple...it's execution is quite complexed.  What's also amazing is that they really focus on the emotions of the characters in this one.  You feel tension, relief, fear...and a host of other emotions that the characters exude.

Characters:
Though the characters are quite entertaining and lovable, no one really goes through any huge ""life-changing"" developments.  Sure, some of them deal with internal conflicts and some learn that they may have been wrong...but their characters essentially stay the same.  This isn't a bad thing, necessarily, though.  It just is what it is.  Fans of Fawn will be pleased though, since this largely centers around her.

The visuals:
Hugely improved and the choreography is brilliant.  Having Scout Fairies for this film really forced the animators to pull out the stops so as to really highlight their combat prowess...and this improvement in animation and choreography trickled down to the rest of the Pixie Hollow community and world.  The scenics are also simply stunning and beautiful as well.

MY ONE MAJOR THEMATIC GRIPE:
This one is a tad subjective but there was one thing that did annoy me about this film, and it was the light that it painted the Scout Fairies with.  I won't be too specific so as to avoid plot spoilers.  But i will say that Fawn and Nyx (leader of her squadron of Scout Fairies) are at odds in their methods.  They both share the same concern, but I couldn't help feel that the Scouts got a bit shafted by appearing like they were ignorant fools and cold hearted stiffs.  In reality, they actually did the same thing as Fawn by seeking as much information on the event as they could before putting figuring out if there truly was a threat or not.  Neither they nor Fawn were particularly looking for a fight.  In the end, though, it was differing information that led them to take one path and Fawn another.  I mean, it just seemed unfair to me that such a wonderful group of fairies should have such a negative introduction...which especially stings because there are small allusions that these fairies are actually just as kindhearted as the rest...they just have a different talent and way of expressing it.  And by the end, there wasn't any real attempt to at least redeem the reputation of the Scouts to the audience.  The crew who did the film really missed a great opportunity to utilize a real-world dynamic where two people of seemingly opposite sides discover that they truly are striving for the same thing, and learn to dialogue with each other.  Instead, they unfortunately settled for an angle which Fawn puts best in her own words, ""They finally see what I see...took them long enough, huh?""  It really is a kind of shame that they did not take much time to milk the emotions, feelings, and perspectives of such a fearless group of fairies that also have sincere hearts and a sense of honor coupled with fierce generosity.  It just didn't seem right to let their legacy end like this if (rumor has it) this really is the last Disney Fairies film that they are planning to do.  I hope it really is just rumor and this won't be the last, though...and it would be nice to have some film features that focus on the scouts, more, in the future.

EXTRAS:
There are many good (but sadly short) documentaries and bonus features.  They are very insightful and, in fact, add to the profoundness of the film.  My favorite was ""My Dad's Movie: The True Story of the Neverbeast"".  This one in particular revealed the personal inspirations that brought about the story (and especially why Gruff was designed the ""scary"" way he was).  The ""5 Essential Ingredients to Getting Gruff"" is another great mini-documentary that highlights the artistic decisions made in the film.  I also appreciated that the deleted scenes were not only shown but explained (what they intended to do...and why they were removed).  There are also a few more extras which were nice inclusions.  All in all, though, these ones were too short and seemingly an afterthought.  Nothing comes close the what they did for the extras for ""Oz the Great and Powerful"".

ALL IN ALL:
This is a brilliantly put together film that can be a wonderful experience for the whole family.  Yes, it does carry heavier tones to it...but I do believe that it carries it in a way that is very healthy even for young children.  Even so, I can understand if someone should feel that they should wait 'til their kids grow older for this one.  The themes are very relevant to both young and old alike...and they are tackled brilliantly.  This may not be my most favorite of the ""Disney Fairies"" films, but it is still up there.",1433635200,,7554,4.740996168582376
6789646,5,B00P8KD29I,"My four year old and I snuggled up one rainy afternoon and watched another Tinkerbell movie. A great departure from the normal, sometimes fluffy Tinkerbell movies. Full of messages of acceptance, doing what is moral and not necessarily the norm , the value of true friendship and how some things things are not permanent. The movie was wonderful. It was not a bit scary for my 4 year old and my 19 month old took a cozy nap. While there is groaning and the beast does appear in pain and sad, it is better than watching Mufasa's or Bambi's mom's death.

Perfect movie for the kids, and grown ups too.

As in ""nightmare inducing"" scary. The Neverbeast is intentionally scary looking so that you can get the point of not judging based on appearances, but he actually gets even scarier looking when he really kicks into action (after you already know about his shining character). My son wound up losing it in a few places, and by ""losing it"" I mean he was shrieking in terror. We're big fans of talking through things and seeing them to the end (for resolution), but the end wound up being super sad. Not like Old Yeller sad but sad enough. Like I, the mom, was crying as hard as my son. So, although it was a cute story, I just thought that it was too high on the emotional scale/fear factor. (Plus, as with any Tinkerbell show/movie, they could stand to be a little more fully clothed. I'm just sayin'.)",1432857600,,958,4.418079096045198

6789681,4,B00P8KD29I,"At this point, Tinker Bell is barely a special guest star in her own series of cartoons.  The star of this feature is Fawn (Ginnifer Goodwin), an over zealous animal fairy.  Her overriding passion for all animals (any animals) puts the colony in jeopardy.  The clear message here is to ignore authority if you want to do what you want to do, regardless of how it may impact on others.  Fortunately, they have a band of scary reactionary militaristic fairies who look after the security of the colony.  Theirs is a shoot first mentality.  They don't take kindly to a rather large furry monster who's just shown up unannounced and certainly uninvited.  Especially as this monster is ill-humored and bent on creating four tall towers of rocks with an unspecified function (artistic merits notwithstanding).  The villain of this piece is Nyx, the dogmatic commander of the military fairies, desperate to stop the `monster' before it does.........exactly what, she doesn't know, but she will stop him at all cost because that's the only way she looks at life.  Working from faulty intelligence provided by a librarian, they stupidly almost achieve the undoing of Pixie Hollow.  If nothing else, this movie is a testament to the need to keep better historical records.  The one saving grace in this animated movie is the nonverbal creature inaccurately named Gruff.  Otherwise, more of the same from Disneytoon Studio.",1432771200,,1412,5.012875536480687

It opens up so many other stories including some from the book series, I'm still hopeing for Rani. The only issue I had with this great family friendly film is a few nitpicky things dealing with Winter as in I kind of wanted a brief apperence from Perriwinkle and one flying through issue dealing where  I know the fairy in question did not get her wings frosted...but the former ai understand why they did it and the later I'll say she was to high up to be affected. Besides those two things I have no complaints and am extreamly glad I watched it and am looking forward to adding it to my collection, as well as seeing what's next for Tink and friends.

This is quite a bit darker with an animal with Maleficient like horns who catches lightning and fairies who are trying to hunt him. My six year old was scared about the super storm green clouds.

6789702,5,B00P8KD29I,"I loved this movie and couldn't recommend it enough. This one revolves around Fawn, the kind hearted animal fairy in previous movies. In this one, she has gotten in a little trouble for bringing dangerous animals through pixie hollow who are injured. She is told to think a little more with her head instead of her heart and she is trying to do this when she hears the roar of a creature in pain in the distance. She decides that thinking with her head can wait another day and goes to investigate.  She comes upon a monstrous-looking creature with a thorn in his paw. After finding a way to take out the thorn, she shadows the creature who is inexplicably gathering rocks to make giant towers. She befriends him and names him Gruff. Unfortunately, Gruff's roar also catches the attention of the scout fairies and one in particular named Nyx researches this creature and what she finds does not sound good. Something about a monster that wakes up every thousand years, grows horns and uses lightening to  destroy pixie hollow.  A good part of the movie revolves around Fawn's friendship with Gruff and the determination of Nyx to subdue Gruff in her genuine effort to protect pixie hollow. Meanwhile, a nasty storm is moving in with green clouds and lightening. Gruff's motives are also unclear until the later part of the movie.

SPOILER ALERT:
 Gruff does change into a horned monster, but it's so he can capture the lightening from this storm so it can't destroy pixie hollow. I know some people complained that he looked too scary, but the whole point of the movie is not to judge based on appearance. Gruff looks every bit like a monster, but he is the hero of the story. I loved this movie. It was beautiful and touching, but I have to warn people- if you think you are getting a standard Tinkerbell film where everything is rosie and perfect at the end, you are in for a nasty surprise. After a brief time where Gruff is part of Pixie Hollow and regarded as a hero, it is revealed that he has to go back into hibernation for a thousand years. The last five minutes are heartbreaking as the fairies do a ceremonial procession leading Gruff back to his cave with lighted flowers leading the way and glowing dandelions showering Gruff. It was touching, but unbearably sad which brings me to my one sore point with this movie: THE ENDING WAS UNRELENTINGLY DEPRESSING  AND IT DOES NOT LET UP. The movie makes you care about Gruff, and it's heartbreaking that he didn't get a happy ending. There is a teary goodbye scene with the main fairies saying goodbye to Gruff, and a reflection of a weeping Fawn reflected in Gruff's green eye as it slowly closes. Then the creators have to rub more salt in the wound with another bittersweet song during the closing credits with drawings of a carefree Gruff and Fawn playing in the woods. I don't remember the last time I cried so much. That being said, it was a beautiful and well-done film. I saw it with my niece and she loved it too.",1432252800,,2979,4.548507462686567

6789704,2,B00P8KD29I,"Did you know that fairies die? Well I didn't either until this movie. I really liked the concept and the message that it was trying to go for, but the last 5 minutes had both me and my 5 year old bawling our eyes out. There were other directions that they could have taken with the ending, or I don't know maybe left out the fact where they say that Gruff won't be back for a hundred years and Fawn won't be alive at that point. My daughter cried all night for poor Gruff, prompting an all out panic for me to track down a plush Gruff from the Disney Store, also an impossible feat. I'm nearly certain they made like only 100 total and half of them are on Ebay with a 300% markup.

Overall I can appreciate the storyline but be warned if you have a sensitive child at home, that this might not be the best Tinkerbell movie to scar them with.",1432252800,3,841,4.096969696969697

I was a bit confused by the Neverbeast, was he good or evil? He appears good then evil, then good again. As I kept watching I was convinced that he was evil portraying to be good. If you've the read bible you can see that there's a deceptive web being weaved..
THE FOUR HORNS

Zechariah 1:18-19 (NIV)
[18] Then I looked up--and there before me were four horns!
[19] I asked the angel who was speaking to me, ""What are these?"" He answered me, ""These are the horns that scattered Judah, Israel and Jerusalem.""

Horns are symbolic of power and refer to Gentile kings and their kingdoms (Dan 7:24; Rev. 17:12).  The four horns or four kingdoms in question are hostile towards Israel and they are responsible for scattering Jerusalem, Judah and Israel.  The four horns gouged Gods holy nation.

The four horns (kings/kingdoms) which Zechariah saw are the same four beasts (king/kingdoms) described in Daniel 2 & 7.

Daniel 7:17 (NIV)
[17] 'The four great beasts are four kingdoms that will rise from the earth.

Babylon (Iraq), Medo-Persia (Iran), Greece (Syria) and Rome (the revived Roman empire in the End Times will become Antichrists ten nation/horn kingdom).  These are the kingdoms that have been historically beastly towards Israel in the past during the times of the Gentiles.  They will again oppress and disperse Israel in Daniels 70th week.  The times of the Gentiles began with Babylon oppressing Jerusalem and will end with the Antichrists oppression and scattering of Jerusalem.

Also, the Neverbeast's 1000 years sleep at the end, well that refers to Satan's 1000 years being locked up. Revelations 20:2-3 Satan Bound the Thousand Years

2And he laid hold of the dragon, the serpent of old, who is the devil and Satan, and bound him for a thousand years; 3and he threw him into the abyss, and shut it and sealed it over him, so that he would not deceive the nations any longer, until the thousand years were completed; after these things he must be released for a short time.

This is some heavy stuff for a child to endure. There are some bad seeds in this world that want to corrupt the minds of the young. Don't let them be deceived!",1432166400,4,2276,4.688442211055277

6789732,1,B00P8KD29I,"I was so excited to see this title available on Netflix and put it on for my three year old and I to watch and it started off reminding me of the pirate fairy with an adventurous and trouble making animal fairy but soon after they introduced the neverbeast I was very hesitant about the rest of it. My daughter was mildly scared during a majority of the movie with a lot of aspects she is not old enough to comprehend, such as GASSING the neverbeast and HUNTING him down with weapons. The part that really made me say no more was when the BEAST GREW HORNS AND WINGS to resemble something DEVILISH. The big ""oh hell no"" was soon after when a lightning began to set the trees around pixie hallow on fire to resemble hell. I'm not a majorly religious person and usually don't notice these thing but this was way too SINISTER for my daughter (or me) to continue watching. Which I'm glad I stopped after reading about the ending when the beast goes to sleep for another 1,000 year and the faires have something resembling a FUNERAL for the beast. I kept waiting for the movie to turn around but was totally disappointed, I was so excited for another lighthearted and innocent fairy movie and definitely got the opposite.",1431907200,2,1215,4.452914798206278

6789789,1,B00P8KD29I,"My daughters are big fans of this series of films.  When I saw the negative reviews I decided to rent it before deciding whether or not to purchase the dvd.  Over-all, I was disappointed in this one.  The film starts off innocently enough and even has some really funny moments.  Suspence builds, as the appearance of a strange commit in the night sky and a subsequent roaring from deep in the forest alert the fairies that something is amiss.  The main character in this story is not Tinkerbell, which is a notable departure from the previous themes in the series.  Fawn, the nature fairy, takes center stage early on.  Tinkerbell plays an only slightly bigger role than the other fairies.  As the story develops, the theme becomes rather foreboding and even frightening, in my opinion, as it appears that Pixie Hollow might be threatened with destruction if an evil prophecy, concerning the true nature of the Neverbeast, is realized.  This somewhat darker theme of impending destruction, coupled with intense animation effects, left me very disappointed.  This film is definitely a total departure from the other story lines.

Also, there is a rather annoying and unrealistic, yet admittedly popular theme, of the all-female Pixie Hollow Defense Force, who, with their gruff, rather masculine, features and personalities, are charged with discovering, intercepting and neutralizing the apparent threat.  Yawn.

All, or any, of the above would have garnered the single star review I chose to give this film.  But, just in case something worthwhile might have been discernible in this mess, Disney decided to give it a big coup de grace, tear jerker ending that darn near made me feel just depressed.  I think it was a total failure.  All of the themes were too adult, dark, sad and political for the intended audience (young children).  I am, therefore, not a bit surprised that Americans love it and that Disney is raking in the cash.  My advice to parents is, pass this one up as an intertainment possibility for your young children, along with Cujo, Jaws and Silence of the Lambs.",1430870400,4,2085,4.942528735632184

6789792,2,B00P8KD29I,"My four children love the Tinkerbell movies. Our home has lots of Tinkerbell themes. This movie was not for us and I hope future movies will be an improvement. Yes, my children do understand the movie. My kids understand hibernation. They understand good-byes. In fact, my children have more hands on experience with animals than most people have had in their life time. My children have assisted me with rehabbing wild animals and have cried happy and sad tears as they are released back into the wild. My children get it. They understand this plot, but they did not enjoy watching this film. All four (male and female & variety of ages) loved the way the movie began, but all agree it ended too sadly. Only one of my children had any desire to see the rented movie a second time and even that child told me that I didn't need to buy it after the second viewing. I think the movie has a nice message and I appreciate the animal friendly theme, but it simply is not one that any of us will own or be seeing much of in the future.",1430870400,2,1029,4.33678756476684

6789811,5,B00P8KD29I,My 11-year old said this is her favorite TinkerBell movie ever. My 4-year old and I were riveted as well. This is an adorable movie that any little girl (and her mom) could love.,1430611200,,178,4.264705882352941
6789812,1,B00P8KD29I,"I am 14yrs old and my sister is 11. She watched this movie first without me, then, horrified, told me to at least skim through it. I was shocked. I mean, I'm no big fan of Tinkerbell, but at least I know them to be light, fun movies for ages 3-12. However, I would not let any small child watch this monstrosity.

The plot was all over the place, mainly high-lighting this enormous, creepy monster and his various trials. He was hideous, showed aggressive, out of character behavior, and later sprouted demon horns and wings, but somehow you're able to feel sorry for him because he is betrayed, hunted, drugged, blinded, burned, struck by lighting repeatedly, and feared. BTW, when I watch a Tinker Bell, I expect to be overwhelmed with sweetness and the power of friendship. This did not do that. We spend about 10-20 minutes with Tink, and spend the other hour with an annoying ditz, Fawn, and her overlarge monster companion. Fawn was annoying. That's all I have to say about her.

Another LARGE issue with the movie was that so many people got injured/killed/drugged ON SCREEN. We see our favorite fairy, Tink, get whipped by 'Gruff's' tail and knocked unconscious (for some kids, she appeared dead for a while), we see Fawn getting blown up and then pronounced dead, we see a fairy SWAT team member get thrown across the forest and into a tree branch, and the air is filled with his screams until a jagged twig snaps and his screams suddenly end...that's, like, really disturbing. Not to mention the hawks! It was explicitly stated that the hawks eat fairies alive. That's gross, especially for a kid's film. A swarm of hawks attacked during the movie, nearly eating some of the fairies, and I know most kids would be traumatized.

If, somehow, a kid was to survive all that craziness throughout the movie, they would be reduced to tears by the end. The fairies are shown weeping and putting Gruff 'to sleep' for a thousand years (essentially forever). The end of the movie is Gruff's creepy green eye sliding shut and Fawn tearfully whispering how much she loved him. Then, with an overly emotional song, the credits roll.

This movie was freakish. It was like a bad fan fiction. Who okay'd this movie anyways? Disney? Hello??? My mom (Samantha) just warned my little cousins to stay away from this movie...they'd be scarred for life. I only watched bits and pieces, and because of it I'll probably never watch Tinkerbell again. Ugh.",1430611200,4,2440,4.720657276995305
6789813,4,B00P8KD29I,My daughter and I love watching Tinker Bell movies together and this one was our favorite one yet!

My daughter is 2 and didn't understand that one of the fairy ' s died mine you its not over dramatic but being an adult you know what's going on but she's fixed and my 2 year old could figure out that it was sad and when she stood up everyone was happy and was all excited again. So I'm sure for older kids they will understand more.
At the end the fairies say goodbye to the never beast and are all sad my little one just says bye bye and is said for that not said like they are in the movie because he will never be seen again.

But I'm not a sheltering mom I won't hide death and loss from her and this respect I like the movie because it's there but not over powering so. A nice tinker bell movie gave a new fairy some spot light which was nice!

I would not recommend it for kids under 9 or 10 especially if you are expecting the same lighthearted magical feeling about this movie.  There are many scary and sad parts in this movie, including very scary monster eyes, scary music, unsettling moaning, and a part where lighting is striking the monster and it is suffering (which seemed quite lengthy, not a quick and done thing).  The end is quite emotional as well, and left one of my kids in tears!  Not how we pictured our fun Friday night movie night to go. Also, lots of the magical aspects that have been fun like the innovative fairy inventions and happy music were not a big part this time.  We were left feeling disappointed and sad.

Little does they know, Nyx(Dawson), a determined scout fairy, vows to find and capture Gruff before she believes he will cause trouble and destroy Pixie Hollow. The special features includes a funny music video featuring Fawn and her love for animals, as well as Disney sneak peeks of upcoming favourites like the Aladdin DVD Special Edition, PIXAR's Inside Out, and the new Disney Junior animated series Miles from Tomorrowland. Tinker Bell and the Legend of the Neverbeast is the perfect Disney animated film that will make you cry.",1429660800,,1128,5.451428571428571

6789913,5,B00P8KD29I,"Loved the movie very much. A bit darker when compared to the previous five. But don't bother about the other negative reviews. The maker's intention is to show only one thing, that ""You can't judge anyone just by their appearance"". Climax is very emotional. I am a 27 year old male and it brought tears to me twice when I saw this. If you have younger kids below 5 yrs, I suggest you watch this before you show to them. Even though Tinker Bell's screen space is less, fawn generates enough fun. Highly Recommended!!!",1429574400,,516,4.5

6789944,2,B00P8KD29I,"This was without a doubt the worst of the Tinkerbell series.  Our family started watching these movies when our kids were young, and now they've grown to tweens and teens.  We actually sat down together to watch, as we'd always enjoyed the prior movies.  I was so grateful that my kids were old enough to handle this odd, twisted, and sad film.  While the first half was enjoyable, albeit slow-paced, the second half quickly veered into dark territory.  The Scouts were loathsome, unhappy, ""police"" figures, the beast frightening at times, and the final resolution included the near-death of a fairy and the equivalent of putting an animal down.  And then it just ended.  Several of us were in tears waiting for the happy ending that did not come.  I'm still giving it two stars because it was visually stunning and it had fantastic music.  Shame on you Disney, and shame on you John Lasseter for executive producing this.  Do not let your kids watch this without previewing it!",1429315200,5,978,4.767857142857143

The first 30 mins are slow and my wife and I considered turning it off but I wanted to see the whole thing before we let our 7 and 4 yr old daughters see it. Honestly, I don't know how soon I'll let them watch it. It is a darker movie than the others. The plot isn't the best when so many new characters are introduced. The other Tinkerbell movies are so good but this one took a detour. Yes, the Neverbeast helped save Pixie Hollow but the end of the movie is so abrupt. It would have been better if they went a little longer and ended with some last minute happiness. At the end of the movie I thought ""what did I just watch?""",1429142400,,722,4.048951048951049

Why end on such a depressing note??? Even ""Terms of Endearment"" ended with a post-funeral scene enabling you to dry your eyes, see the characters smile again and realize there's hope yet for the future. This one ended on a funeral dirge-like scene. There was just no relief! I only gave it 3 stars (instead of less) because my kids enjoyed it up until the end...

This is one I regret letting her watch.  The story idea had great promise, but the details of the story were way too mature for the target audience (4-10 year old girls).  SPOILER ALERT: The NeverBeast turns into a demonic looking flying monster about 3/4 of the way through the movie, complete with green glowing eyes, Maleficent-esque black horns and creepy black bat wings.  At this point there's a bunch of lightening, a huge storm, yelling and confusion on the part of the fairies and my daughter curled up in a ball on the couch, crying and holding a pillow over her head.

Each of the movies in this series has a point near the end where Queen Clarion gives her ""talk"" addressing the lesson learned. However, that does not happen in this movie and I really noticed it. I am guessing it is because this is to be the final movie of the series. Again, with this being the final movie, this one is a bit darker than the rest with a rather somber ending. I would give it 4 1/2 stars if I could. Definitely worth watching if you love the series.",1428451200,,628,4.07258064516129

I liked her the way she was. They dressed her a little more ""sexy"". Also the underlying theme for all Tinkerbell movies seems to be that even when you blatantly disobey your ultimate authority it will turn out ok and actually make things better in the end.

She loved it; even with the Neverbeast's scary green eyes and the dark tones of the movie.  I was worried it would be too much for her, but she was fine and wants to watch it over and over again.  There were two parts that were a little too much for me ---when the hunter fairies put the purple fairy dust on the Neverbeast and the end when they lead the Neverbeast to his bed to sleep for a thousand years.  As an animal lover, Fawn's goodbye had me in tears.  Added bonus:  Blue Ray, regular DVD, and digital download (Woohoo!) were included!",1428364800,,711,4.333333333333333

6790081,2,B00P8KD29I,"Finding good movies that are not ""baby"" zombie type and not overly violent and scary has been a bit of a challenge for our 2.5 year old daughter.  She's very advanced for her age and understands and absorbs everything she watches.  The Tinkerbell movies have overall been pretty good and enjoyable.  I can't stand the mindless bouncing character shows/movies, or the high pitched Disney character voices that talk like babies all the time.  Was excited to get this one for Easter and read some of the reviews about it being somewhat scary, and I agree.  The cover is misleading.  My daughter ran to me screaming and crying very early when the beast is discovered.  I watched it with her and explained not to be scared, that he's friendly, but he's terrifying looking and it's difficult for a younger kid to realize the lesson of the movie.  Skip this one if you don't want scary beasts, with big sharp teeth, scary roars, and demonic eyes from an animal that grows giant lightning catching horns.  Plus, ""scout"" ferries that basically look to hunt and kill are introduced and really ruin the theme.",1428278400,,1098,4.7368421052631575

First thing my 8 year old daughter noticed was Fawn did not look like Fawn.  Why did Disney change the look of the character?  We have watched all the movies before this one and know what she looks like, why would you change her?  Comparing pictures it looks like they changed her hair and made her face prettier.  It was frustrating!  Then half way through the movie my daughter is covering her eyes because the NeverBeast is scaring her.  What a dramatic movie for Tinker Bell!  We love the whimsical stories and the fun characters but this one was dark and very dramatic.  Not for small children at all!  We were very disappointed!",1428278400,5,754,4.511111111111111

6790128,3,B00P8KD29I,"Not my favorite Tinker Bell movie... The beast is dull and scary. The threat is a mysterious green comet that starts a green rainstorm.  I just didn't relate. It's not a sweet story that can translate well to playing make believe. There was also an odd occult symbolism that is popular in Hollywood right now as (spoiler) the ""beast"" gets charged up by lightening and grows horns and wings like the infamous baphomet figure. If you like ceremonial magic, then you'll probably like this film. However, it might teach summoning to someone too young to understand the ramifications.",1428019200,,579,4.908163265306122
6790129,5,B00P8KD29I,From start to finish well written very entertaining for both children and adults. It is however a little dark for a tinker bell movie as you will notice from negative reviews.

If your kids frighten easily I would avoid this feature.,1428019200,,404,4.5479452054794525

The movie seemed slower paced than the previous movies.  A few new characters were introduced, but they didn't really add to the story.  There was no depth and background like in previous movies.  The story does focus more on Fawn, the animal fairy, but similarly ignores most of the other fairies.  Even Tinker Bell plays a minor role--much to the disappointment of my youngest daughter.

Still, with five kids ages 1-10, this was a good renter.  If you're out of movie ideas, then this is good filler, but it lacks the charm and fun of the previous movies.",1427760000,,819,4.75177304964539

6790188,5,B00P8KD29I,"Of course, my five year old daughter is bound to love a new Disney Fairies installment, but the big surprise is how much my husband loved it.  He and I were both crying at the end.  This film focuses mostly on Fawn and it instantly made her my daughter's favorite fairy.  Some of the scenes with the Neverbeast are a bit scary at first, we spent a lot of time talking about it with our daughter ahead of time, and even previewed the book at a store so she could be sure that it would turn out ok.  When she was ready to face her fears, we watched it and she did fine.  If anything, she had a bigger problem with the Fairy Security force- she was frustrated that they couldn't see past their duty. She even used birthday money from her grandma to buy a stuffed version of Gruff, the Neverbeast, that she sleeps with every night.

These films are better than so much other entertainment out there for kids, and have appeal beyond just girls.  Please Disney, don't drop this franchise!",1427673600,,982,4.333333333333333

I saw a review complaining about the bittersweet ending and the reviewer had the audacity to state that people saying their kids loved it ""do not have kids."" My daughter AND my son - who usually rolls his eyes at the TinkerBell series - loved this movie. We love the entire series, and I thought it was fabulous how they branched off to focus on another one of the girls in the main group of friends instead of just TinkerBell, I thought it was great when they did that with The Pixie Hollow Games and had the spotlight on Rosetta overcoming her fears and challenging her assumptions on strength and beauty. You can be strong AND beautiful! Strength IS beauty!!! The NeverBeast did not have the same tra-la-la ending as the others did, but I don't necessarily see that as a bad thing. It was very touching - I don't want to spoil the movie - and we all still left it with a good feeling. I hope they keep making these movies because if they keep on the same path of empowering female characters and touching on subjects like friendship, believing in yourself and never giving up, we're in.

I don't think it was a s bad as everyone says and that's saying a lot if you knew me because I won't even let my kids watch sponge bob.,1427587200,,375,3.5180722891566263

He's still too young to understand the tear-jerker ending; I cried. He never once seemed startled or afraid of this movie.

6790233,1,B00P8KD29I,"What a stinker!  I can't believe that Disney made a dark and ugly Tinkerbell movie.  In the ""old days,"" one or more people in the production of the movie would have reviewed it and quickly concluded that most of the subject matter is inappropriate for small children, and it would have ended up on the ""cutting room floor.""  (In this case, just about the entire movie should end up on the cutting room floor.)  But somehow, this movie got the green light and ended up being made.  It should also be noted that it takes many months of efforts from hundreds if not thousands of people to make an animated movie such as this.  The movie initially gets storyboarded and every frame is determined months ahead in great detail before it is finally animated.  So it's not like they made the movie halfway and then suddenly realized that a Tinkerbell ""film noir"" was a bad idea -- like they hadn't a clue beforehand.  They knew exactly what they were crafting, and it kind of makes you wonder why they feel the need to put out this ""message.""

There are many elements in this movie that are not appropriate for small children.  They are: (1) The ""hawks eat fairies"" scene.  They touched on this briefly in a previous movie and seemed to imply that hawks were the ""enemy.""  Of course, now it has to be revisited, leaving nothing to the imagination by explicitly stating that you will be eaten alive, with the theme being multiplied by several hawks. (2) The Neverbeast, with a somewhat frightening appearance, takes a quantum leap in scariness by morphing into a monster with large horns and bat wings. (3) Tinkerbell's seemingly mortal and soap-operatic injury, which would appear scary to a child. (4) The weird scowling Ninja fairies with all their assorted weaponry, which are strangely brought up now, whereas we've seen many times in past movies that the fairies generally live in harmony with nature and have no need for a SWAT team, and one was not needed when a hawk appeared in a previous Tinkerbell movie.  (5) Fire and brimstone cyclonic storm complete with green clouds and green lightning that hits Pixie Hollow. (6) Extreme overuse of violent lightning strikes. (7) Portrayal of the near-death of a fairy (Fawn), which is totally false and contrived when it's been previously established that the fairies are immortal. (8) A Pixie Hollow version of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (""get the paddles"") for cardiac arrest when the Neverbeast jolts Fawn back to life with some green cardiac defibrillating energy.

Heck, with all of this, I was waiting to see if they'd add a mushroom-shaped cloud somewhere over Pixie Hollow. And the green spinning storm was impressively animated, but was it an F5? And why would you want a small child to see any of this in this context? What happened to the general themes of all the previous movies, based on the characters and their environment, of general cooperation and unselfishness, harmony with nature, empathy for others, respect and nurturing for the environment, ""girl power,"" using one's talents to be helpful and for the greater good, and being a good team player. There was a feeble 10% attempt at a few good messages mixed in with 90% of apocalyptic doom and gloom that is forced down your throat nonstop for 60 minutes.  Again, one has to wonder why it kept coming fast and furious throughout the entire movie, when none of the other Tinkerbell movies were remotely like this.

It is also of interest to note that the voice actress for Fawn has been Angela Bartys for all the past movies, except this one.  The name in the Neverbeast closing credits for Fawn's voice is Ginnifer Goodwin. I wonder if Angela Bartys read the script, realized what a turkey this film is, and refused to take part in it.  Then they had to get somebody else to do the voice.  Since it's a different person now, they also changed the character slightly by changing Fawn's clothing as well as her hair style, making her sort of a brunette version of Vidia's hair.

What's next, a Tim Burton version of ""Nightmare in Pixie Hollow"" where all the fairies have black Frankenstein stitching across their faces, and instead of melodic tinkling when they talk, the sound of machine gun fire? The bottom line for this movie is that you should ask yourself, ""How does this movie make you feel? Where is that ""feel-good"" feeling that is usually obtained while watching a Tinkerbell movie?"" As you watch this movie, you might keep on watching and waiting, and you'll realize as you get to the end that the answer is ""nowhere.""  At least, there are very few parts of this film that qualify. No wonder so many children end up scared and crying after watching this celluloid error -- they already know the answer to this question.",1427414400,19,4746,4.742405832320777

There is humor and cute creatures (I fell in love with a headstrong baby bunny), but it's just not enough to uphold the Disney balance. Again: my goodness!",1427068800,3,411,4.722222222222222

6790327,2,B00P8KD29I,"I'll start this review by saying that we love the tinkerbell movies in general.  They are beautifully animated and very sweet in general.
This movie however was pretty intense.  Lots of scary scenes and while I was prepared for some talk about how ""the beast LOOKS scary but isn't really scary"" it wasn't the beast that was so scary - it was the intensity of the conflict.
This movie had my 7 year old sobbing hysterically for the last 15 minutes of the movie.  My 4 year old also was very scared, but not crying so hard like the 7 year old.  Seriously - crying hysterically - at a tinkerbell movie.  It was very sad and heavy for sensitive children, and it didn't even have a ""happy ending"".  I'm not expecting all movies to have happy endings - but tinkerbell movies?  Yeah, I would sorta expect that they would.

SPOILERS:

There is a point toward the end where a major character, one of the fairies, actually dies.  Is dead.  But then is brought back to life by the neverbeast.  This was terrifying for my 7 year old.  And then the neverbeast himself has to basically die - go away for 1000 years never to be seen by the fairies again because they will be dead before he comes back again.  all of this was very unsettling.  and then the movie just ends like that, with all the fairies sad.  What the heck?  No.  Just no.  My kids are going to totally have nightmares tonight.  Not a fan.",1426982400,5,1391,4.33852140077821

6790330,5,B00P8KD29I,"Our daughter is 6 and has a few of the Tinkerbell movies, so I jumped on the chance to be able to review this one for her! We LOVE this movie, and in my view it's much better than the other ones so far. It can however be a little scary to smaller kids possibly, but she loves it.

I am a huge Disney movie lover myself and the Tinkerbell movies have been pretty good so far, I think. I enjoy watching them with her sometimes. This movie is about the Never Beast, which he appears to be a mean and scary beast but in reality he is very nice and gentle to Tinkerbell's friends, especially Fawn as you can see below.

This movie is returning to the great place known as Pixie Hollow. This particular movie is about an ancient myth of a massive creature sparks the genuine curiousity of Tinkerbell and her close friends. One friend, Fawn is an animal fairy and she is not afraid to break the rules to help an animal that is in need. However, this creature isn't welcome in Pixie Hollow, and the scout fairies are determined to capture this oh so mysterious ""beast"", because they're scared that he will destroy their home. Fawn is determined to convince her fairy friends to risk everything to rescue the Never Beast.",1426982400,,1212,4.3584070796460175

6790346,4,B00P8KD29I,"Note: this review contains minor spoilers. My girls and I are HUGE fans of the Tinkerbell series. They are some of the best movies for girls that I've seen in the past 10 years. We've enjoyed all of them! They are well-written and well-made. We loved Nix also; what a great new role model! However, we just want to say: WORST ENDING in a long time! The sweet but overly emotional goodbye scene felt like an unfair heartstring-yank - with no salve offered after as the movie ended with the ""funeral scene."" Did someone dare the director to end on a sad note? There is a reason why the famous Hero Cycle (think Lion King) ends with Glorification or Apotheosis. This movie certainly did not. We noticed that the third-to-last scene where Fawn is drawing a new picture of the NeverBeast would have been a much better finale. There also could have been a special ceremony to honor the creature each year, or a sweet little epilogue of Fawn visiting the sleeping beast. It would have been good to see Nix and Fawn reconcile also, as this series teaches such great lessons about relationships. Instead, all that was left out, and the movie runs just 1 hour and 16 minutes. The only good thing about the ending was that it sparked a great family discussion about how it could have ended instead!",1426896000,,1287,4.551724137931035

Had to spend time cheering to a house full of sad kids. I wouldn't watch this movie again, nor would my kids request to see it again. I'm glad I only rented and not purchased. My kids will watch the other Tinkerbell movies over and over, but not this one. Therefore my rating is a three based on the way Disney chose to end this movie. I don't want to spoil it for anyone reading reviews to determine whether to watch or not. But be aware the ending is sad if watching with young kids.",1426636800,,661,4.338709677419355

When his daddy got home from work, we had to show it to him too, so we watched it three times the first day!  I have always been surprised that these movies are direct to DVD, but Tinker Bell and the Neverbeast really should have been released in theaters...it's that good!

When the scout fairies grow fearful that the mysterious NeverBeast will destroy Pixie Hollow, friendly Fawn must convince Tinker Bell and the rest of the locals that the creature is in fact a gentle giant.

What did I think?

Despite the title this movie centres around Fawn the animal fairy and its a welcome change of focus for a franchise that can do both light and heavy in its increasingly growing canon. It may lack the clever Peter Pan referencing that The Pirate Fairy had but instead provides a heartfelt tale about not judging a book by its cover. At a short 67 minutes theres no concern over wandering attention and Executive Producer John Lasseters influence shines through as youd expect. What you wouldnt anticipate however is the bittersweet and almost too honest ending which might leave parents answering a few tough questions. But don't deny your kids an enjoyable, emotional film that they will want to rewatch.",1426550400,,947,4.869565217391305

6790466,5,B00P8KD29I,"Thank you Disney for sending us a copy of the movie to review!

Even though Tinkerbell is in the title of this movie, she isn't the main character.  She does make a few appearances though.  Tinkerbell and the Legend of the NeverBeast focuses on a fairy named Fawn, an animal fairy who specializes in  the wildlife surrounding Pixie Hollow.  Because of her love for animals, Fawn often gets reprimanded for bringing potentially dangerous strays into the fairy village.

After a recent scolding from the queen fairy, Fawn stumbles onto a unique creature that she has never seen before.  Vowing to think with her head and not her heart this time, she studies this unusual animal that likes to make rock towers.  She wins its trust when she helps remove a thorn from its foot and a friendship between them is born.

While Fawn fully trusts this unusual creature, the guardian fairies wish to send it away because of a legend about its involvement in a deadly storm that is starting to brew.  Is this creature the source of the problem or the solution?  Can the fairies come to an agreement and work together?  You'll have to watch the movie to find out since I don't want to spoil it for you.

My husband, daughters, and I enjoyed this G rated 76 minute long film.  Keep some tissues handy for the ending as our eyes were all watering towards the end.",1426550400,,1347,4.558333333333334

I never once stopped to consider that it would frighten my girls who are 5 and 6. No other Tinker film has ever done that.

First: Listen to your heart. Super important.
Next: Don't judge someone (or some THING) before you fully understand it. But if they suck, go ahead and judge, I don't blame you.
Last: Friendship 4ever!

The Tinkerbell Franchise is seriously legit. I think all their movies are 533587x better than those ""Little Mermaid 2"" and ""Tarzan 2"" movies. Those are trash. These are designed and animated really well, and have fun and adorable characters. I don't even care that I'm a 24 year old that is wondering when the next Tinkerbell movie is going to come out.

I will say it is kind of deceiving when they say ""Tinker Bell and the...."" when the movie is mostly about Fawn. But I also like that they show case all the different fairies and how each one of them is important. Tink can be kind of annoying so another movie with her...pass. I want one that's all about Silvermist next because I love water!!

6790510,1,B00P8KD29I,"We were so excited about this movie release. Kids couldn't wait for it. We love the other Disney Fairies movies and watch them often. But this one -- we could NOT have been more disappointed. The peril, turmoil, darkness, loss...what was Disney thinking, putting this in a Tinker Bell movie? My children are 5 and 9, and we watched it together. During the early hints at trouble, I reassured them that things would turn out alright (it's Tinker Bell, OF COURSE it would.) OH MY GOODNESS. It just got worse and worse, and never recovered. You fear the beast, then fear for the beast, they attack him and take him away, you think a fairy is dead, there's a huge lightening storm, and the ending is out-of-control sad (while touching, it's like a funeral service.) Oh -- and if your children think that fairies live forever, you'll have to deal with that issue, as the fairies realize that they'll never see the Neverbeast (who sleeps for 982 years) again. The weeping that was going on in our house. Really. Who gave this movie the green light? And said, ""Yes, marketing this frightening, dark movie to the same audience that enjoyed the last four Tinker Bell movies is a good idea."" I immediately put on The Pirate Fairy when this was over, just to bring some cheer back into the house and restore my children's love for the fairies (and we never watch two movies in a row.) What a tremendous departure from the others this is. Hugely disappointing.",1426291200,4,1448,4.616279069767442
6790511,2,B00P8KD29I,"Having watched all the Tinker Bell movies with the kids, this was rather disappointing. While all the other films provided rich characters and poinient lessons for discussion,  the characters here were rather static. The graphics were also less impressive on the whole. Large landscapes were well done, but up close the art felt much flatter than previous films. One segment related to which season summer fairies could fly, where previously they could not,  made no sense with previous film continuity. The story lines protagonist needed a stronger backstory that could only be accomplished by a longer film, or a planned sequel. The epiphany moment for one of the main characters was poorly executed and ridiculously abrupt. Worth a rental- may not have a high re-watch value until later movies help explain the continuity and new character.",1426291200,2,843,5.1911764705882355

It follows Tink's friend fawn, and her ability to see past what's on the outside of  creatures. She wants to help all animals and learn about them. It tends to get her I trouble though.

Having said that, this movie was awesome!  For a change, Tink wasn't the main attraction.  Fawn is a hoot.  Those scout fairies were amazing!  I loved Nyx.  It took true courage to stand against a monster, even if the effort was a bit misguided.  It felt good to see some of the other fairies showcased.  I think the scout fairies stole the show.  I'm waiting for Vidia to get her turn at main billing.  Please, Disney, make more of these!  I wouldn't mind seeing an entire series of Pixie Hollow movies.  There is clearly a large social structure there.  A fertile mind can come up with many tales that showcase different fairies.",1426204800,,786,4.521428571428571

While there's much of the same kind of music to love, the story itself is intense and, at times, quite scary for little kids. It's hard to say more without giving too much away. The ending itself closes on a sad, somber note, yet quite touching.

Personally, I enjoyed this movie. I was impressed it was able to deliver a more action-oriented film with a bit mystery, yet stay within the Tinker Bell universe.

If you have doubts or concerns, definitely consider watching the movie yourself before introducing to little kids. You might find yourself a bit teary-eyed at the end, too.",1426118400,,648,4.725663716814159

I, like many other parents, blindly trusted Disney (b/c, you know, it's Disney- fairy tales and happy endings) and let my daughter watch it before I did. When I asked her how she liked it, she shrugged and said told me it was sad. Well, for me, most Disney movies have a sad part, then a happy ending. I didn't listen and I should have. My daughter does not cry at movies, and in fact, thinks it is funny to make sure I have a box of tissues before we watch a Disney. We were both in tears by the end of the movie.

That being said, it is actually a good  movie - a more serious themed movie with more mature themes and messages. It was nice to see other fairies featured. Just have a box of tissues handy and Parents, watch this one FIRST before letting your kids watch it, especially if they are younger. This movie does not have a happy ending.",1426118400,3,891,4.114942528735632

We have read the Chronicles of Narnia and The Hobbit without any fear response, and he has seen the original Star Wars Trilogy, but TBATLOTNB was apparently too much.  It has some complicated themes of social shunning and power and control, which may have been a little too close to home based on my son's kindergarten classroom experience.  If this is the case then I look forward to more in depth discussions with my little guy regarding metaphors he sees that might parallel his own life, and I should probably rate this movie a bit higher, but if he is just terrified of the CGI and a little overwhelmed by the whole thing then I think a three-star rating is justified.",1426032000,,859,4.35625

6790554,5,B00P8KD29I,"My daughter has been watching this film series since it first began (she is now 8). This is by far the best. The first film to step far enough out of it's light and fluffy nature so that I won't want to poke my own eyes out while watching it. It keeps up with the same humor the series has always had, and the characters are still their lovable selves. The ""monster"" will definitely be loved by you and your children alike. I've seen some parents leave reviews that it's ""too scary"" or ""too sad"", but I can tell you it definitely isn't either of these things. Yes, your child may experience the slightest bit of anxiety or sorrow considering certain parts of the movie, but nothing too heavy happens. The worst that happened is my 3 year old son said ""no"" a few times during the ""scary"" scenes, but he was snuggled up to me and never shed a tear. The ending is warm and positive, with a slight sorrowful undertone, but I think the heaviness of what was happening was something smaller children may even completely overlook. It affected ME more than my children! If your kid couldn't handle this movie, better keep them away from Lion King and any other disney movie where characters actually die.

6790556,1,B00P8KD29I,"What were the writers thinking? This should have been called ""Fawn and The Legend of the Never Beast"". Tinker Bell became a minor character and a minor character became a major one. The previous Tinker Bell movies had family/multi generational appeal. My wife and I have loved the movie series (kids and Disney fans at heart!). Before this, it had charm, grace, humour, and artistry. Here they took out all the male characters except one nerd. What was John Lasseter thinking allowing this extreme change in storyline? As a male I needed some male characters, especially the ones like Clank, Bobble,Fairy Gary, and of course Terence, for the boys and adult males like myself.

  It was sad to see them do this. The previous movies were more family friendly. But now they made a darker, less funny, too serious movie focusing too much on action and less on the fun, loveable characters of the past. They killed the fun. If the series continues like this  we will never. watch anymore in the series and will encourage our friends with families to avoid them.",1426032000,4,1056,4.754098360655738

I don't know why Disney strayed from a very positive and endearing formula to this catastrophe. My daughter and I didn't preview the movie because every Tinkerbell movie we had seen was a delight. What a mistake that was -  I will never again trust Disney to make a film suitable for my Granddaughter - I will absolutely screen anything they produce before she sees it. What a disappointment.

I think the movie is trying to teach kids to not just a book by it's cover or a beast by it's scariness as the case may be, but there was a better way to do this.  I found myself crying at the end and then the movie just ends on a horribly sad note without trying to bring back the cheerful Tinkerbell movie feeling. I loved the Fawn point of view and the introduction to the NeverBeast, but this was too sad for my tastes and far too sad and scary for my 4 year old.  She was clinging to me for half the movie going ""oh no!"", ""Is he okay?"", ""Did he die?""  Just be wary before buying it.

Unfortunately this movie is not like the rest of the enchanting series.  The story is about an alien being that falls from the sky in Pixie Hollow.  Fawn finds him and even though the creature is very gruff (just like his name) she stays with him and tries to bring the best out in him.

Meanwhile a new group of fairies are introduced to the series, these girls are like Terminator fairies..yikes!  The protector fairies do not want Gruff around and feel he is a danger to Pixie Hollow.  Fawn enlists the help of the usual group of sweet fairies to go against what Queen Clarion and the protector fairies feel best, which is keep Gruff around until everyone can see he's good.  Eventually Fawn is able to prove that Gruff really is good but not before the story line leads you to believe he is out to destroy the entire Pixie Hollow.

My daughter who is 6 years was afraid during the movie and has not asked to watch it since.  I purchased the movie on Prime instant video and regret not renting it first.  It's a could be a good storyline for another series or movie, I just strongly felt that it was completely wrong for the Tinkerbell series.",1426032000,,1290,4.427966101694915

6790587,4,B00P8KD29I,Warning! This is a sad movie in the end. While a great film I wouldn't let any children under the age of seven see it just yet. It's a beautifully done film with great music and moments of laughter but deals in some heavy story points that may fly over the littlest one's heads. I as an adult enjoyed the film. I'm not shy to admit that I cried at the end. Although it has Tinkerbell in the tittle she's rarely seen in this film. It focuses on Fawn the animal talent fairy instead.,1425945600,2,481,4.127659574468085

I read they originally were going to make 8 movies. I am sorry to hear they are they will not be making the last two films.  All of Tinkerbelle's girlfriends have been the center in the other films {with Rosetta in Pixie Hollow Games short film.} with the exception of Silvermist & Irredessa the last two movies could have highlighted each one of them. Having said that I have really enjoyed the Tinkerbelle movies & short film They have given me and my Great Niece many hours of happiness each time we watch them.

My kids NEVER want to see it again. THEY CRIED like never before. I wasn't watching it with them, so I encouraged them to finish it out and see if it gets better..something good was bound to turn things around right? WRONG...the damage was done. I wish I would have turned it off or watched it before I allowed them to watch it alone...but it's a Tinkerbell movie and I had some trust that Disney would not make my children feel so horrible.  I HIGHLY recommend to any parent..watch it first! I didn't and I wish I had. Disney deserves a round of appause for making children cry..I mean really?",1425945600,14,768,4.296551724137931

6790599,5,B00P8KD29I,"This review contains plot spoilers so parents can make decisions.

This ""Tink"" film centers around Fawn. The message is to learn to think with your head and not your heart. Fawn loves animals and in the beginning rescues a fairy eating baby hawk. Later we see Hawks chasing fairies with the intent of eating them. This scene may be too intense for some kids, you know the ones who can't get past the opening of Nemo. (I personally know 2 of them.) Later in the film the Neverbeast is introduced, again initially in a scary manner, but Dawn pulls the thorn out of its paw and they become friends as the ending once again gets dark with lightning etc. The ending is (real plot spoiler) similar to something what we would expect out of the ""Fifth Element."" Dawn dies, but only for a moment as she is revived.

This is clearly one of the more ""darker"" Tinker Bell films. The series had been made safe for those who scare easily. I will be testing this one out in the next week.",1425945600,,973,4.370165745856354

6790638,5,B00P8KD29I,"One of the best in the Tink series.  If your child loves animals, this is a good one.  This whole movie focuses on animals and the love of animals.  We have always loved Fawn.  The message in this story is great.  I don't want to reveal too much though!
There were a couple parts that may be scarier for very young kids....Having to do with the Neverbeast.  He is good but at one part his appearance changes and he looks more like a monster.
There are new characters revealed.  Tougher.  I don't like how they were portrayed.  I think they are too tough for a Tink movie...even their costuming is tough.
If you get bonus features, this movie had some of the worst.  The director appeared too much!
Overall you will like it.  Fawn is the complete lead with Tink and the rest playing the support cast.  My girls and I (7,12) loved it.  Both of them are huge animal lovers.  They want to someday be a vet or own tons of animals on a farm.  If your child is like that...they will relate to this well and Fawn.  Enjoy!",1425945600,,1013,4.252631578947368

6790644,5,B00P8KD29I,"I'm not big on fairies, but my granddaughter loves Tinkerbell. I sat and watched this movie with her and have to admit that I enjoyed it as well. The story is about following your heart, friendship and helping others. The NeverBeast has a thing for spit and bricks. I know it sounds gross, but once you see the movie, it will come together. Tinkerbell has a habit of following her heart but not using her head and has often times brought danger to the Fairy Village. But this time is different as Tinkerbell embarks upon the NeverBeast, she tries to keep him safe while other fairies in the village try to capture and contain him. They find that the NeverBeast is not there to hurt them, but to help them. The story was a touching story about friendship and helping your fellow man. I recommend this for any girl child, especially ages 3-8.",1425945600,,840,4.496732026143791

6790666,5,B00P8KD29I,"This is a great addition to the TinkerBell Series.  It teaches kids that things are not always as they appear, and that sometimes you have to admit you did the wrong thing, accept responsibility and make it right through your actions.  It also teaches that sometimes you need to let things happen as they are meant to before you can fully understand the outcome.  My 7 year old son pretended to be disinterested, but I caught him watching over his younger sister's shoulder, which means there's enough action to keep a young boy engaged.  There are some scary parts for younger kids that may require an adult's presence for comfort.  My daughter (under 5yo) was scared a few times on the first watch through, but she got over it when things calmed down a bit, and she understood that the 'monster' was just doing his thing and meant no harm to anybody. I'd recommend this for any kid who can handle some action with their pixie dust!",1425945600,,933,4.562874251497006

I thought that since it's rated G, I need not worry.  I'm just about to the point of boycotting everything that is Disney.",1425859200,7,249,4.23404255319149
6790678,4,B00P8KD29I,"I have watched the movie twice now and overall I am very pleased with it. But the ending leaves much to be desired,  I will get to this later. Fawn is our main hero this go - around and it shows, a new outfit and hair style let's the audience know she isn't just a side character this time. I personally like her more barefoot, tomboy look but maybe that is preference.

  The message of the movie is to use your heart, but to think with your mind; not your heart. Coincidentally this is also my favorite verse in the Bible. (Proverbs 28:26)

Pro:
Amazing animation and colors
Cool new characters in Gruff and Nix
Beautiful opening.  Seriously it is amazing.
Great message for kids to think with your mind not your heart.

Cons:
They enter winter woods with not-for-profit wings with np
A dozen fairies can somehow break the fall a huge SUV sized creature.
The tacked on ending.

If you are still reading this in my opinion the pro outweigh the cons and this movie is solid and beautiful.  But the cons are so sloppy that it just shows this director's negligence with the series. Winter woods,  super strength fairies, this is just pathetic oversight of not even watching the other movies.

And the ending...brace yourself, near the end phone clearly says a line that is very well set up to be the ending line for the movie. She says, ""looks like they finally see what I see. sure took them long enough."" This line is obviously the original end to the movie, but then a part about Gruff needing to hibernate comes up and a sad ending occurs because our fairy crew will somehow never see Gruff again.

And cue rant:
Is the director this stupid? 1000 years is a long time...If your not in Neverland,  you know, the place where you don't age! Very poorly done. A huge oversight. And obviously begs the question of how fairies age and how fast. We know they get old from Dewey In secret of the wings. So what in the world?

But that isn't my biggest complaint. How do you end with a creature you come to love dying at the end. That is dumb as -- what's that? Hibernation?  Yeah good luck explaining that to your 4 through 6 year olds. No attempt at a light hearted ending kills the otherwise 5 stars this movie should have had if it had just ended with, ""Now they see what I see.""",1425859200,,2276,4.360189573459715
6790679,5,B00P8KD29I,One of the cutest Tinkerbell movies.  It brought me to tears at the end.  It made me want a never beast of my own!,1425859200,,114,3.7083333333333335
6790680,5,B00P8KD29I,"The movie, although darker than the previous ones, is a really great movie. For those who say that Gruff dies at the end, I ask you to watch again, because he doesn't. The Legend of the Neverbeast, teaches children, as well as adults, (because I am) that you should never judge a book by its cover. I am 18, have no kids, but I love the Tinker Bell movies because of the morals and lessons that they teach. I highly recommend watching, but watch the movie yourself before showing to your children, so you can make a mental note if you don't want your children to watch it.",1425859200,,572,4.305555555555555

6790682,5,B00P8KD29I,"Wow. This was the best Tinkerbell movie yet.  It is powerful, incites intense emotion, is a tearjerker of the best and most wonderful sort. A true fairy tale in the tradition of both Disney and real fairy tales.  Love, friendship, misunderstanding, loss and heroism are all beautifully dealt with in this movie.  I believe it's worthy of any award out there.  And yes, I and my family, including my husband, 13 year old son and 9 year old daughter were all in tears at the end every time we have watched it, but those tears are not a bad thing.  They are a release.  Yes, Fawn and Gruff will not be together again because of how the life cycle of the Neverbeast works.  He'll wake again in another thousand years, and she'll be long gone.  But they knew each other.  And they had a wonderful friendship while they did.  To keep this movie from children, as some have suggested, is a folly I think.  Children know love.  They know loss.  If we as adults don't address it with them they won't know how to deal with it when it comes.  This film deals with the issue with a sensitivity and caring that is as near to perfect as you could get.  So Five Stars to Disney for another amazing movie.  Keep them coming!  Sincerely, The Willis Family",1425859200,38,1238,4.383259911894273
6790683,1,B00P8KD29I,"I was very disappointed with this movie. My 7 year old and I, love Tinker Bell movies so when we saw this on Amazon TV, we had to rent it for Family night. However, this movie was different than the others. For one thing, like the last reviewer commented, Tinker Bell is hardly even in the movie and the NeverBeast is cute but turns really scary and into what kind of looks like a Demon or Lucifer???!!!!
My whole Family was shocked and confused on why a children's cartoon movie, would have such a dark story line???? Parents should be warned, that though the Beast is cute, he turns into something evil which might give the younger kids nightmares! I know, if my 7 year old was younger, I would have wanted to be warned about this movie. As she is 7, she still looked kind of scared and frightened!

6790687,5,B00P8KD29I,"Tinker Bell and the Legend of the NeverBeast is an adventurous movie about Tinker Bell and her good friend Fawn, (Ginnifer Goodwin) an animal fairy with a big heart and an adventurous mind.  As Fawn is flying through the forest, she notices a mysterious cave and hears a weird sound coming from inside. Fawn immediately flies inside the cave to see what is happening. Fawn discovers a mysterious creature that no one knows anything about. She begins to observe the creature and notices he does a lot of strange things. Fawn names him Gruff. Nyx and the other fairies try to capture the big green-eyed beast because they fear he will bring harm and danger to Pixie Hollow. Fawn tries her best to convince Tink, Nyx and their scout friends and fairies not to harm Gruff.

My favorite character is Nyx (Rosario Dawson). Nyx is apart of the Scout fairies. She protects the fairies in Pixie Hollow and tries to get rid of anything that would harm them. Nyx is very cool, confident and strong. She likes to get her job done.

My favorite scene is when Fawn tries to help Gruff hide from Nyx and the other fairies. As Fawn tries to hide Gruff in a secret place, he lets out a very loud and big sneeze and he sneezes on all the other fairies. It is really funny.

The message of this movie is not to judge people. Gruff is a creature that only wakes up every 1000 years for a special task. Everyone in Pixie Hallow thinks he is a bad beast. He is actually a nice creature.

The DVD/Blue-Ray combo has bonus features which include never before seen bonus extras, access to cool computer games, five ingredients to getting Gruff, The True Story of the Neverbeast and so much more!

Tinker Bell and the Legend of the Neverbeast is a fabulous movie.  It will be available on DVD/Blue-Ray/Digital on March 3, 2015. I recommend it for boys and girls ages 3 to 10. I give this move 5 out of 5 shinning star

I didn't even think to screen the show ahead of time because who would ever think a Tinkerbell movie could be a problem?!? My 10 y.o. sensitive daughter cried and cried after the show and felt sad and depressed the entire day as well as the days after whenever she'd think of it. According to her there are three particularly distressing scenes - so upsetting she couldn't bring herself to describe them to me because she'd start crying and feeling miserable just thinking about it.

I'm very disappointed that Disney now thinks it's appropriate to cause unrelenting sadness and distress in their child viewers. Shame on them!",1425859200,9,784,4.7226277372262775

6790690,5,B00P8KD29I,"My daughter, who is now 10 years old, has grown up watching the Tinker Bell animated features. Our least favorite was the Pirate Fairy - it just didn't appeal to either of us. However, this new installment, ""Tinker Bell and the Legend of the Neverbeast"" is not only a departure from the other Tinker Bell features, it is also way more serious in the themes explored.

The storyline revolves around Fawn, the animal talent fairy, who is constantly getting into trouble because of her love for animals which causes her to try and protect all creatures, even the ones that could potentially harm the fairies such as the hawks. This puts Fawn into direct conflict with the head scout fairy. One day, Fawn discovers a gigantic creature and names it Gruff because of its gruff demeanor. Strangely, Gruff seems bent on building towers and this behavior baffles Fawn. Knowing the scouts are on Gruff's trail forces Fawn to disclose her secret to her best friends: Tink, Iridessa, Silvermist,Vidia, and Rosetta. Together they try to keep Gruff safe before the scouts get to him, but is Gruff really harmless or is he the means of the fairies' destruction?

This new film in the series addresses the theme of love, sacrifice, and loss (not death) and is a bit scarier than the other films in the series. Gruff has glowing green eyes and as a Neverbeast looks the part of a frightful monster. It may not make it suitable viewing for younger children, and the themes may not be easily understood by many younger children as well. I would recommend it to children ages 7 and up, but there should be a parent watching along so as to facilitate meaningful discussion.",1425859200,,1652,4.71280276816609

There were some scenes that would be too scary for her and the ending was sad. It was more focused on Fawn, than Tinkerbell, so the title is a little misleading.

The Neverbeast is a completely different kind of Tinker Bell film...focusing in on Fawn, the Animal Talent Fairy, this film explores real emotional depths akin to Disney classics like Dumbo (think Baby Mine scene).  The end IS a surprise from the normal Fairies fare, but I totally appreciated that this treats [spoiler] separation and loss with heartfelt emotions. I am looking forward to discussing this film with my 9year old niece, whose personality is just like Fawn's -- she thinks with her heart first and often rushes in without considering the bigger picture.  She also just lost her dog 2 months ago, so this is the perfect movie to watch and see how to say goodbye.

I wished I had previewed this one before watching it with my girls (and my sister) and having all of us sitting on the couch in tears at the end; my little one was especially heartbroken.

The animation, as usual, is solid.  Characters are well developed - the focus is on Fawn rather than Tink; the Never Beast treads the line between adorable and scary.  The plot is predictable and there is definitely something very familiar in it, but the end...oh, the end...it is beautiful and tragic in a way that these movies are usually not.

She is 4 1/2 now and was so scared by this one that she has been crawling in our bed the last few nights.  The first half of the movie is good/ok...the last half was very dark and scary and so downright sad by the end that I was in tears.

6790713,5,B00P8KD29I,"I was saddened by some of the poor reviews.  The message of the movie is patently clear.  The beast is scary in the middle but it was a great way to cover stereotyping.  The movie is wonderful.  Yes the end is a tear jerker, but you already know what the end will be at the beginning of the movie.  There are many family conversation openers that this movie invokes- especially if your child has aged with the series.  I cried at the end as well and I'm 40.  Not sure why it is such a horrible thing that a child displays appropriate emotional reactions to it. The end is actually the beginning of a new cycle.  The movie should have been titled Fawn and the Legend...  Fawn is the main character and most fans know who she is.  At minimum Pixie Hollow and the Legend of The NeverBeast would have been good.  I love Tink but it just ain't her movie- it's Fawn, Nix and the Beast's movie.  The movie doesn't suffer for not having Tink as the star and I hope the other fairies continue to get their shot in the limelight.  This movie falls right into Disney's ""moral of the story"" type device very nicely.  If you are worried about how a child younger than say 6 will react just watch it beforehand and decide (That is my normal method after getting burned by certain ""children's"" films)  It's always good to watch or read these things first until you know you can trust the author/writer.

We will wait awhile before showing her this movie because it is too intense and scary for our 4 year old. I am still giving this movie 4 stars because it is a good movie. Great animation, great new characters added to the fairy franchise and a sweet story with a good message. It is not my favorite of all the fairy movies, but it is a nice addition to the library. All kids are different, so I will include the parts to watch out for so other parents can decide whether this movie is okay for their child.

***SPOILERS BELOW***There is an extended and intense scene where hawks are attacking the fairies (fans will have seen this in other fairy movies), the scene where Fawn first meets Gruff is scary - she travels alone through dark and creepy woods and walks through a cave in darkness while Gruff growls and yowls (he is injured). These two scenes are very close together, making the first 15 minutes of the movie action-packed. Gruff himself is pretty scary looking and you are not too sure during much of the movie if he is harmless or not. Several fairies are injured and one nearly dies (you think the fairy is dead). There is a major magical storm with lots of lightening and trees being hit. The ending is sad... not your typical fairy movie uplifting ending. It made me cry as an adult and young children may be confused about the ending which involves a goodbye and funeral-like procession that isn't a death.",1425772800,57,1541,4.460992907801418

It seemed to us to be a bit darker than the rest and quite frankly just not as fun.

6790719,5,B00P8KD29I,"This is another great addition to the Tinkerbell series of movies.  Just as in the last movie, where Tinkerbell herself did not feature prominantly, Fawn is the star of this one.  The story is adorable, and manages to bring just the right amount of cute, sad, thrilling, and funny all at the same time.  They further develop the world of the fairies with a new ""talent"" - the scouts, who are super-awesome but sometimes misguided ""police"" figures.  The plot twists in this one are at least as interesting and probably a little more nuanced than the previous Tinkerbell movies.

I have to say, having read some of the negative reviews of this movie and having somewhat easily frightened 6-year-old girls, I almost didn't show them the movie.  What a mistake that would have been!  My kids did not find it scary at all, nor did I.  They understood the themes of the movie well, just as they always do in the Tinkerbell movies.  It's bittersweet at the end, but not truly sad.  Yes, I cried a bit but I also cried a little in some of the other Tinkerbell movies and they're pretty tame.  PLEASE if you love the Tinkerbell series you should watch this.  I don't think you'll be disappointed.  One of my kids won't even watch the Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, or other movies she says are too scary.  She didn't find this even slightly scary.",1425686400,,1345,4.55

I am still in shock that my daughter and her cousin (age 5) were inconsolably crying by the end of a ""Tinkerbell"" movie! I agree with the other one star reviews and am baffled by this strange, dark, and sad movie.  *SPOILER* The ending was like the fairies were putting their friend/pet the Neverbeast ""to sleep.""  A Tinkerbell movie should not end with all the fairies in tears and a sad song about never seeing someone again for 1000 years.  It was really awful.  The adults and nine children I watched it with all agreed, it was a depressing way to end our evening and a disappointment to fairy fans of all ages.",1425686400,29,698,4.4296875

6790723,5,B00P8KD29I,"My husband and I have watched every Tinkerbell movie in the series with our 3 year old daughter and The Legend of the NeverBeast proves (in our opinion) to be the best yet. You have to keep in mind that this movie at its heart is a beautiful love story.

Now I have read many of the 1 and 2 star reviews...""evil""? nope, sorry not at all. ""Scary""? maybe... but I kinda thought that was the point in the message of how we can judge on appearances without truly knowing all the information and what's on the inside (this is exactly the mistake that is demonstrated by Nyx!) and Fawn says near the end of the movie ""now they see what I see""-what a beautiful lesson for children to learn about making snap judgments that can have unintended repercussions. It was great to see her character so wonderfully developed that it wasn't a big deal to not see Tink-we have seen plenty of her in 5 previous films so why not give someone else a turn right!

Yes, this movie has some sad parts but to be fair my 3 year daughter had some deep belly laughs at many more parts than she was sad. I find it interesting that so many find that feeling sad to be such a issue. Feeling sadness is a normal and natural emotion even though so many of us can not tolerate feeling this way. At least you can be together as a family during the sad parts and help process the emotion with your child in a safe and secure environment. If this movie prompts your child to start asking tough questions surrounding death-then it's time to talk about it anyhow and what better way to start this conversation. Also keep in mind that for those that feel sad (and this was myself included as I bawled at the ending and my daughter was right there next to me) that it speaks to how well written this movie (a Disney movie no less) is to elicit such an emotional response! I was impressed with how deeply made me feel as an adult!",1425686400,,1889,4.259052924791086

My 4 year old and I are completely enraptured the entire movie.  Yes, I ugly cry at the ending every time I watch it, but the ending is absolutely perfect and one of the most beautiful endings I have ever seen.  For those who say it ends sadly, in my opinion, it ends on a happy note.

I was nervous getting it after reading the negative reviews, but we didn't find the Neverbeast scary at all.  Each growl and grunt is pretty well explained, so much so that my 5 year old wasn't phased.  It's an exciting film, with a wide range of emotion throughout, but from my perspective, that's what makes it good. We enjoyed getting to know Fawn, who takes the lead in this movie and who we think is as endearing as Tink.  The end took a little explaining, but even the seemingly most innocuous movies have situations that need explaining to young children.

Spoiler alert: My daughter says her favorite part of the movie is the friendship that developed between fawn and gruff. She said the scariest part is the storm, but she also said, ""It's not really scary"".",1425686400,,875,4.554140127388535

I am glad I did because I probably would have written the same review if my kids were toddlers. Now that they are 6.5 and 8.5 year old boys my review is slightly different. The whole family enjoyed this movie, including my husband, who had rolled his eyes at the Tinker Bell choice for family movie night. I will admit I cried at the end, but I was the only one. Unhappy endings and saddness are not new for Disney movies - actually nearly a hallmark of them, though it is a departure for Tinker Bell movies. I remember as a small girl crying and crying during the movie Born Free (obviously a traumatic experience). For all the negative things some say it portrays I think they miss the flip side to what it does portray - seeing those who are different from us without judgement, sacrifice, duty, love, compassion, regret, and how to show remorse. I do recommend this movie but not for the toddler set. As with Maleficent, talk about some things to expect before hand and again afterward.

My daughter wouldn't even pay attention to the movie when all the chaos started; while the fairies are all charismatic as ever, the overall concept of the movie is not comparable to previous in the series. Even the normally spirited songs in the movie seem creepily out of place, this movie is definitely not a buy, and a step completely in the wrong direction compared to Pirate Fairy. Most likely this movie will be collecting dust while we go back and sing along with ""the frigate that flies"". Hey ho people... hey ho.",1425686400,12,638,4.916666666666667

To the parents who think it's too dark, scary, and ""demonic"", what did you think of ""The Princess and the Frog""? We haven't let our daughter watch that yet because that's truly scary and demonic. The Neverbeast looks scary but is sweet and gentle. He was judged by his size and appearance and was found to be a danger but actually saved the day. This isn't the first time Disney taught the lesson to not judge based on appearances and to listen to your heart.

Our 5 year old twins have watched all the How to Train your Dragon movies and episodes so we are used to scary looking beasts with a good heart but something about this story line made them scared (and made me cry my eyes out at the end).  If you think your kids might be a little scared when it comes to darkish stories, skip this one or watch it on your own first to be a good judge.

6790762,5,B00P8KD29I,"The Legend of the Neverbeast is my favorite Disney Fairies movie yet. Here is a heartwarming story about trusting your heart and believing in others. Perhaps better written - plus even more thrilling, unpredictable and amusing - than the other Pixie Hollow films, I can't help but think that the DisneyToons' storytelling capabities and willingness to take the emotional level up a notch finally pulls through with this entry.

Is it fair to say that I have a new-found respect for the character, Fawn? Considering that *at least* 50-60% of the movie involves her either talking to herself or the Neverbeast, she really knows how to stand on her own as the star of a Pixie Hollow film. New favorite character? - Perhaps!

Also, can somebody please say something about the music? No? Okay, then I will! I found myself listening to what was going on in the background just as much as what the characters were saying! The soundtrack is more theatrical in scope than I remember in the previous films, with obvious multicultural influences (not just a Celtic sound) that suited the ""wild animal"" and ""nature girl"" themes.

This film may well be more for the adults than for the kids... You see the mixed rating here on Amazon? This is likely the reason. I am a parent to a 7 year old who has not yet seen this film. ***I can't wait to share it with her.*** As a parent it is my responsibility to warn you, though: youngsters *may* be frightened at times (there's lots of perilous action in this one) and saddened by the bittersweet (but 100% appropriate) ending. But we can't expect endings to be sunshine and rainbows all the time, guys, can we? Not even for our children. I do not think children should be sheltered from the valuable lessons this movie has to offer. Especially the lesson given in the end.

Yes, the ending. Never before have I finished a Disney movie in tears. NEVER before, until now. But oh, how I loved the fade to black.

Obviously those people who gave it 1 star completely missed the whole message of the movie. I'm not going to spoil it for everyone, but the basic message is have an open heart.

6790778,1,B00P8KD29I,"I am not a reviewer of things.  I have to be incredibly moved (either good or bad) to do so.  This movie was such a colossal Disney fail (in my opinion) that I had to write.

1.  It's scary!  My kids were hiding in several parts of the movie.  The plot line is that you don't know whether the Neverbeast is a good guy or a bad guy.  He starts ""transforming"" because of lightning and it's done in a way that is scary to the average kid.

2.  There's a new set of fairies called ""guardians.""  They are a pretty violent bunch.  I mean there's no punching or swearing, but they certainly aren't training forest animals or making flowers bloom.  My kids didn't care, but I was sort of surprised.  Pixie Hollow isn't supposed to be an aggressive place...

3.  The ending is sad!  My six year old has seen just about every Disney movie and has never cried because before.  At the end of this one, she looked at me with a quivering lip and tears on her cheeks and I was useless to her because I was crying too!  The two of us crying made my four-year-old cry.  At that point I started laughing because it was probably quite the sight, but I was also disappointed that Disney would put out a movie that kids would think would be fun to watch (I mean it's Tinkerbell for crying out loud!) and the movie ends with everyone crying.

This might be fine for the 9 and up set (who probably wouldn't be interested in a Tinkerbell movie), but I didn't think it was content appropriate for my six-year-old and certainly not for my four-year-old!

I then watched Gruff grow demonic wings & horns with lightning shooting into them from scary apocalyptic green clouds as he roared in pain. What have you done to idyllic Pixie Hollow; these are fairies, not storm troopers. Even the music was ominous; there was no happy dancing during the credits. No joy here.

Just some relationship/friendship conflicts that ultimately got sorted out in the end. the life challenges were real and the positive messages clear and meaningful.

This movie starts with a warm and gentle beast. Then the director attempts to truly scare the target audience of young kids with irrationally frightful scenes with truly angry and scary beast expressions that don't have much explanation. in one case of tinkerbell getting hurt, it is simply a bad camera angle for the audience. The beast grows devil like horns and wings, again it seems in just a wild irrational gesture to scare the audience even more. Finally the beast redeems himself with some kind actions. the ending has sad moments of death and loss.

My young kids (7 and under) were devastated by this and had nightmares the same night. I was hopelessly lost in finding rational explanations as to why the beast looked angry and did seemingly hurtful things. i looked to tinkerbell always to prompt useful discussion about life lessons. this time i was just hugging my kids while they huddled in fear.

Fawn is funny but I wish the title was different - without Tinker Bell's name on it.

My child had all sorts of questions about why wouldn't they meet again in 1000 years?  Don't fairies live forever?  Aren't fairies magical?

But if you love the fairies of Pixie Hollow, you won't mind.  There IS a lesson to be learned in this movie...a couple actually.  Don't want to give anything away, though.  This one is certainly a tear jerker, but it's an amazing story.  Give it a chance.  Our kids are 8 and 10.  It's possible small children might find this one a bit scary at first but soon *a bit of a SPOILER* you find out the beast isn't what he SEEMS to be at all....my daughter wants a stuffy (that's what she calls her stuffed animals) of him very BADLY now...lol.

My daughter is already scared of many things such as ""tiger cave"" on Aladdin, which is why we've never made it through Aladdin. My husband and I knew Gruff was going to take some time to love, so we bought her the plush for Valentine's Day for her to warm up to the creature. Score! She loved the plush, and carries it everywhere and tells everyone about him. We talked up the movie and finally bought it the week she came down with strep and flu. Movie was sweet at first and teaching my daughter looks aren't everything. We made jokes about how he looks like our cat. And then ( spoiler alert) came out the horns, crazy wings, growling and lightening. I kept watching her telling her she's helping, it's ok but it was just too much for a 4 yr old to understand. She's even more terrified during the day, not wanting to leave my side, more "" come with me"" potty trips. She'll even leaves the room now when her favorite show is on, and parents know how rare that is! All and all cute movie, beautifully animated a little too scary for youngins.

Now I really think if you plan on showing this too a younger child around 3 and up to 10 you might want to preview it first yourself. I saw some reviews saying that their younger children were terrified of the never beast. I remember as a child I was terrified of ET so I'm sure that the never east could scare some children.

We expected it to be similar to the rest.  It is not.  It is the darkest in the Tinker Bell series.  My older daughter said it was like PETA tried to make a movie showing how inhumane fairies have become.  Wow - DISNEY - my daughter is still crying.  Disney set many kids up with the heartwarming commercials only to have their hearts broken.  Much like getting rid of the Pixie Hollow gaming website. If you must, rent it first and preview the movie before you let younger kids watch it - especially the last 15 minutes.  And no happy ending, no fireworks, no happy FROZEN ice skaters.

We watched as a family and all 5 of us, hated it :( My 4 year old has never cried at a movie before, it crushed me.  Unlike kids mentioned in other reviews, my kids were not afraid of the beast, they felt sorry for him, ""why are the fairies being so mean to him"" ""he's hurt"" ""the poor beast mommy"".  Any animal lover will feel their heart strings being pulled to the max.  90% of the movie this creature is misunderstood, unloved, feared, working tirelessly, is hunted, get hurts, whimpers and cries, finds his mission sabotaged, is betrayed by his only friend, is tied up, drugged, blinded, sprouts painful horns and wings (I see how some kids were scared by this, but my kids just empathized with the painful aspect of it), he's electrocuted and burnt, BUT he doesn't care because all that matters to him is that he saves the fairies who have showed him no kindness.  And then the end...a fate worse than death. Shame on you Disney, I am so disappointed, and angry honestly.  Would a happy ending have killed you Disney?  Maybe life doesn't always have a ""happy ending"" but we watch Tinkerbell type movies to escape the harsh realities of life sometimes.  How did nobody during the making of this movie feel it was too dark, too deep, too sad?

My 3 year old had a couple times in this when she was afraid and turned away and sorry that just doesn't sit well with me, considering all the other films in this series have been more upbeat and positive.  I wonder why they didn't wrap this series up with Tinker Bell meeting Peter Pan or the introduction of Neverland?  As usual the production, visuals, score, songs are top notch, worthy of a theatrical release, but the odd story and darker elements really hurt this and it's disappointing given this is the probably the last one.

Then at the end, she started crying because Fawn would never see Gruff again (don't the pixies live forever?). When the tears stopped, she asked me to give away the CD because she never wants to watch again.  Wow.
There is a major loss due to death or separation in many Disney movies: Dumbo's Mother, Bambi's Mother, Elsa's and Anna's parents, the Toy Story toys are just a few examples.  My daughter has seen all of these and none has ever brought her to tears.

On another note, why does Think have so little screen time in the last movie of the Pixie Holllow series?",1425427200,16,852,4.464516129032258
6790824,5,B00P8KD29I,"Despite me placing this movie as the best of the franchise Disney made a big mistake here. Im sure that reason this movie is getting so many bad reviews is not obviously because the movie is bad at all, but because toon Disney segregated themselves from an older audience, and just focused on younger ones, of course parent could take the movies themselves while being with their kids and they didn't suffer like in movies such as Chipwrecked from Alvin and the chipmunks because those voices of the chipmunks were so annoying. It was very bad to putting themselves into low standards relating to subject matter, theme and drama. I think Legend of the Neverbeast works best by itself than as the ending of the tinkerbell whole series, and I feel terrible sorry about it. Why oh why did they just warn the audience rating this as rated PG instead of G, that way at least the viewers would now what to expect.

Sales are decreasing in this one for this reason, the older audience who this story was better aimed didn't know the series and weren't interested in seeing it, so they are possible watchers who will never know only until a long time from now hurting the series even more. I do think that Disney will learn from this mistake and once more audience out there know this last one they will reboot the cartoon again, but probably that won't happen soon. If we look back at movies like The Lion King, The Black Cauldron where both involved deaths and not death and then bringing back a character like the one we are reviewing. But they worked anyway because they were out by themselves.

I seriously dislike all of these people rating the movie bad in stars when their rating is just because their kids got scared and not because of the actual movie theme. I would recommend them to give a higher rating and don't hurt the series like that scaring people away from buying it, but explaining what happened/ thats how they should act. But come one. I will never see this movie again, my kids could not sleep all night--- comments. Come on people! Why is the use of you the parents in there? Are you those kind of parents who use the TV as babysitters and just go ahead with your own business? Do your job for crying out loud, and stop this nonsense you all negative reviewers. You are all doing your parenting all wrong and have to blame it on someone or something.

Also, I have to thank all of the people here who had sad children after watching this movie and still gave at least a 3 star rating while explaining what happened.",1425340800,,2532,4.476190476190476
6790825,1,B00P8KD29I,"I have only written a few product reviews in my life. This movie - so starkly different from all previous Tinker Bell films - has compelled me to write this one...especially for any families with little ones.

Our preschooler has loved all of the Tinker Bell movies thus far. That said, we purchased this one without renting it first...assuming we'd love it as much as the others. Lesson learned for the future.

This movie begins on a light-hearted note but about midway through takes a fairly sharp and dark turn. Dark turns to borderline terrifying and ultimately...just really sad.

Still not sure what the ultimate message of this movie is supposed to be - and even if my preschooler isn't digging too deeply for movie messages just yet...she does know the clear difference between fun/happy and scary/sad.

If you have little ones who love the Tinker Bell films, please be cautious before showing them this movie - especially before bedtime.",1425340800,45,947,4.9
6790826,5,B00P8KD29I,"This movie was awesome! The Neverbeast was lovely, even with the wings and horns (which, I suppose, are supposed to be scary). Yes, the ending is a bit sad (I cried, but then I often do when friends say goodbye in movies), but there's a great lesson here about loving others, even when they are hard to love in the beginning and may not look as cute as baby bunnies and ducklings.

Is it scary? I suppose it is a bit, but no more than some of the other Tinkerbell films. The whole ""dead butterflies"" part of Great Fairy Rescue (especially later when Tinkerbell is captured, and this is indicated to be her intended fate), the rats on the ship in The Lost Treasure, and the behavior of Hook in Pirate Fairy were all at least as scary (if not more so) than Neverbeast, who never came across as particularly menacing or frightening to me. That said, some kids may be more scared of a large, relatively friendly beast than they are of a man acting worse than a beast ever would. (Personally, I find the opposite true.) If such is the case, those children might find this movie scary. Basically, if your kid cried and hid behind the couch during Pooh's Heffalump Movie, then this is probably a bad choice for them. Otherwise, the movie is great! :)",1425340800,3,1243,4.427947598253275

6790831,4,B00P8KD29I,"Ive seen all six of the Tinker Bell Pixie Hollow movies, and Tinker Bell and the Legend of the NeverBeast is the best one yet. It could have been titled Fawn and the Legend of the NeverBeast, because the animal fairy (Ginnifer Goodwin) is the star of this film. Like the younger sister in Frozen shes wonderfully passionate and exuberant, but shes also fearless and determined to confront dangerous animals to learn about them or to help them.

NeverBeast introduces a monster to Pixie Hollow in what can best be described as a fairy misadventure that borrows liberally from Aesops fable of Androcles and the Lion and Disneys own Beauty and the Beastwith a third act that reminds you a little of Ghostbusters.

The animation is as beautiful and strong as the other entries in this franchise, which is mostly aimed at little girls, but because the action and peril are ramped up, NeverBeast might appeal to boys as well. The second act might sag a bit with everything going so best friends lovely, but once the third-act Armageddon kicks in, everyone will snap to attention. Much more is at stake in this film than in previous Tinker Bell movies, and theres even a Bambis mother momentwhich, [spoiler] sigh of relief if you have very young children, turns out to be only momentary.

NeverBeast is more complex than the other Pixie Hollow entries, not only because of a more intricate plot, but also because it illustrates that sometimes people aren't bad, they're just misinformed or misunderstood. And sometimes doing the right thing is complicated by not being absolutely sure of what the right thing IS.

The takeaway for even the youngest viewers will be that when you are kind to someone or somethingas Androcles and Fawn were when they removed a thorn from the paw of a ferocious creaturethat kindness might be rewarded. And sometimes things that appear scary aren't all that bad. Looks can be deceiving, and thats something else that will resonate with younger children. Whats more, theres plenty of humor here, as when Fawn, in an early sequence, secretly nurses a baby hawk back to health. When shes discovered and everyone freaks out, reminding her that hawks EAT fairies, she says, Naw, hes just a baby. And with perfect comic timing, the baby hawk pecks at her head.

NeverBeast has a lot of fun details and moments like that, in addition to a ramped-up action plot and intense third act, all of which make for a pretty big pay-off. And it looks fantastic on Blu-ray. I give it a B+/A-. FamilyHomeTheater.com",1425340800,,2519,4.7949308755760365

This movie is a bit darker than the other fairy movies so if your child is not one who likes movies such as Snow White or Sleeping Beauty even Lion King I suggest screening  the movie first before they watch it. But with its dark parts it is one of the better story lines I have seen come out of the franchise and am very please with it, fast passe and fun.

6790844,4,B00P8KD29I,"Got the blu-ray yesterday and watched it right away with my 2 and 4-year olds.  We love the Disney Fairy series.  There is nothing too scary, no real bad guys, or witches to be scared of.  They are totally watchable over and over (which we have done), even for adults.  My personal favorite is still the Secret of the Wings so I will give that 5 stars and one less star for this.  This one was still very good, the animation superb.  Fawn is such a lovable fairy and someone my animal-loving 4-yr old can relate to.  Tink and the other fairies did not have a lot of screen time in this movie but that's ok.  We like finding out about other fairies.  Scout fairies are super cool!

Some nit-picking...I don't like the whole Fawn make-over.  You could hardly recognize her in this one.  In the previous movies, she's always had a long braid in the back and a more boyish look and sound.  She's definitely more girly here.  I love Ginnifer Goodwin who did Fawn's voice in this movie but she sounds very different from other Fawn voices.  Also, in this one, apparently, the warm fairies can fly in winter now.  I like how Tink's winter coat made a come back.  (I made that a similar one for my daughter one halloween, so I was excited to see it :)).  But it was such a big deal in the Secret of the Wings movie to not be able to fly in winter.  That's the biggest disappointment I had with this.  The tiny re-writes of the rules in every movie is a little bit annoying, but we still love the series.  There also wasn't a very memorable song from this one.

Overall, it's still a great addition to the series.",1425340800,,1604,4.276666666666666

6790846,4,B00P8KD29I,"Tinker Bell and the Legend of the NeverBeast is the latest installment in the Disney Fairies series. This time around the spotlight is on Fawn, the animal fairy. Besides the better animation, there is nothing that will win you over if you don't already like this kind of movies as the story is rather predictable. But if you are a fan of this series, you will also like this installment..

Without spoiling it too much, this is a story about Fawn ability to love and understand an animal, regardless of how terrifying it looks and against what others think of it. This movie also gets to explore a bit more about life in Pixie Hollow.

To say that the animation on this movie is better than on previous installments is an understatement. Since this film is about Fawn, her animation is way better than anything else seen on the past. However, the most dramatic change on this film seems to be on Fawn's personality, which is is more bombastic, akin Tinker Bell's personality, down to her mannerisms. This is not distracting, but it feels like she was more subdue on previous movies.

Even as the main focus of this movie is Fawn, we get to met Nyx, a scout fairy. I actually like Nyx sense of responsibility, seemingly contrasting Fawn's. This is just nitpicking for nitpicking sake, but where were the scout fairies in the first Tinker Bell movie? This is just to point out how the Disney Fairies mythos keep growing from that first movie, which is an aspect that I love of this series.

The movies on the Disney Fairies series follow a very straight forward story, with some a bit more sophistication than others. This story falls in the low side of the sophistication range. This is not to say that the story was bad, just that is was predictable. This charming story almost surprised at the inevitable end.

I was disappointed when I noticed that a rule established just two movies before was modified or bent to fit the story. When the fairies have to travel to the Winter area, they were wearing winter coats, yet they could still fly with their wings exposed. I thought that the freezing air in the Winter area would freeze fairy wings unless you were a Winter Fairy or got your wings treated by a Winter Fairy. They probably got some ""special"" treatment that no longer require frost magic from a Winter Fairy, but this was not addressed.

Finally, I feel this movie should have been titled ""Fawn and the Legend of the NeverBeast"" or at least ""The Legend of the NeverBeast"" instead. From the teasers, it is obvious that this movie is about Fawn, but it seems that the only reason it has TinkerBell on the title is because she would attract more buyers.

Overall, I like this movie a lot. However, with so many Disney Fairies movies in this series, it would take more to overtake the number one spot which I still hold undecided between ""The Great Fairy Rescue"" and ""Secret of the Wings"".

PS: This is the second story about one of Tinker's close friends. The first was about Rosetta in the awesome ""Pixie Hollow Game"" short story included with ""Secret of the Wings"".",1425254400,,3073,4.594890510948905
6790847,5,B00P8KD29I,"Tinker Bell and the Legend of the NeverBeast is an adventurous movie about Tinker Bell and her good friend Fawn, (Ginnifer Goodwin) an animal fairy with a big heart and an adventurous mind.  As Fawn is flying through the forest, she notices a mysterious cave and hears a weird sound coming from inside. Fawn immediately flies inside the cave to see what is happening. Fawn discovers a mysterious creature that no one knows anything about. She begins to observe the creature and notices he does a lot of strange things. Fawn names him Gruff. Nyx and the other fairies try to capture the big green-eyed beast because they fear he will bring harm and danger to Pixie Hollow. Fawn tries her best to convince Tink, Nyx and their scout friends and fairies not to harm Gruff.

My favorite character is Nyx (Rosario Dawson). Nyx is apart of the Scout fairies. She protects the fairies in Pixie Hollow and tries to get rid of anything that would harm them. Nyx is very cool, confident and strong. She likes to get her job done.

My favorite scene is when Fawn tries to help Gruff hide from Nyx and the other fairies. As Fawn tries to hide Gruff in a secret place, he lets out a very loud and big sneeze and he sneezes on all the other fairies. It is really funny.

The message of this movie is not to judge people. Gruff is a creature that only wakes up every 1000 years for a special task. Everyone in Pixie Hallow thinks he is a bad beast. He is actually a nice creature.

The DVD/Blue-Ray combo has bonus features which include never before seen bonus extras, access to cool computer games, five ingredients to getting Gruff, The True Story of the Neverbeast and so much more!

Tinker Bell and the Legend of the Neverbeast is a fabulous movie.  It will be available on DVD/Blue-Ray/Digital on March 3, 2015. I recommend it for boys and girls ages 3 to 10. I give this move 5 out of 5 shinning stars. \

6790848,5,B00P8KD29I,Wonderful. Easily one of the best in the series. My daughters are 4 and 7 and thoroughly enjoyed it. I know some have been critical of the movie suggesting that it was violent or dark. It was neither. But it did convey a sense of consequence and taught well the lesson that fearing something or someone just because they are different can be very harmful. My daughters were clearly more emotionally invested in the relationship between Fawn and the Neverbeast than between Tinkerbell and Periwinkle or between Zarina and her friends. My wife and I enjoyed it as well.  I like as well that one of the existing fairies was the central character. It would be nice to see that continue in future movies.,1425081600,,699,4.637096774193548
6790849,1,B00P8KD29I,"I am very disappointed with this movie - isn't this suppose to be a movie for kids?
Scary chasing scenes, dark and scary forests, a very scary sky... and the advise to listen to your head instead of your heart (since that gets you in trouble).
Good for all that the star (not Tink but Fawn) did not obey and listen to her heart anyway... which saved the day.
So, is this the message: kids, go do what you think is right, not what the adults tell you (which generally is a theme in the Tink movies)?
And since most adults might already be insensitive to those dark scenes - the scary moments, visuals, and escaping from the dangers of the world, let's make sure our kids get used to it from early on as well?
I also did not like that the movie had to end on such a sad note - I prefer to leave happy.
And while I believe that it's a good thing to listen to your heart - and also, that not all that looks scary (like the beast) needs to be dangerous... I do wonder - couldn't this be told with brighter visuals in a sweeter tale?",1425081600,13,1027,4.064039408866995

6790853,5,B00P8KD29I,"As a family, we adore the Tinker Bell movies because they are movies not just for young girls, but also for the entire family. The Legend of the Neverbeast follows along with the plots to the other movies - there is no ""bad guy"", just bad choices, and a bunch of fantastic fairies working together to fix the problems that arise from those choices. You also learn a valuable lesson, and in this movie the lesson is to trust your instincts.

In this movie Fawn meets the Neverbeast, and she has no idea what he is or why he's building massive towers all over the place. What is the Neverbeast and why has it suddenly appeared in Pixie Hollow? That is one of the main premises of the film.

A few things to know - if you're a huge Tinker Bell fan, be prepared because you don't see her very much in this ""Tinker Bell"" movie. My husband said it should've been called Pixie Hollow and the Legend of the Neverbeast instead because you see a great deal of Fawn and probably less than 15 minutes of Tink.

Even though you don't see tons of Tink, the movie is still a great one to pull the family together to watch. And yes, as with all the other Tink movies, I cried. I know, I know, I'm a bit baby, but the very end had tears coursing down my face.

8686894,4,B00P8KD29I,"Oh my gosh, this movie. We are Disney Fairies fans in my home. Both my kids love Tinkerbell and the gang, and this movie is no exception. I can see how some scenes may be intense for some kids, but my 3 year old daughter watched without any fear. I love the message of not judging a book by its cover.  The only reason this is not a 5 star review is because I, in my 31 years of age, can not watch this movie without bawling at the end. It is seriously so sad and offers no redemption at the end. Great movie, though!",1527897600,,517,3.9238095238095236

8686899,4,B00P8KD29I,"The Sixth and last of the Tinker Bell movies, I note this was released to the big screen in some other countries, but not in the USA. Copyrighted in 2014, release date is in March 2015. The previous Tinker Bell films had America Ferrara as Fawn, now it is Ginnifer Goodwin. Before Fawn hardly said a thing, now she is the star, and Tinker Bell hardly appears. I also note Fawn is the only fairy to wear boots (the others wear slippers). What is that about? Reminds me of the Black Sabbath song ""Fairies Wear Boots."" Also Silvermist (Lucy Liu) likes to applaud a lot and seems to be the most innocent of the fairies. A surprise is to have Rosario Dawson in the movie (as the scout Nyx) with very aggressive military habits. While the film is made for little girls, there are scenes violence and darkness that little children might find disturbing.
  The rendering is very excellent, but the plot is a mix of naive and darkness. The best part is the slow development of the fairies learning that Gruff is not a threat but a defending hero of Pixie Hollow. Gruff looks like a badger with a armadillo tail, but behaves like a dog. One scene has Fawn apparently dead, but the writers use a motif from Frankenweenie to revive Fawn. On the whole, a very good film. It includes a documentary on the making the film. Has Fawn singing a song about all the animals in Tinkin' with Animals short.",1521244800,,1384,4.44488188976378
