8270948,4,B0018SH94S,"This DVD is for a 13 movement, 8 minute set of neck exercises.

There are minor inconveniences - the English captions are adequate - the introductory text is scary: 'chaptel' and 'resumb' (chapters and resume)- but the actual subtitles are fine.  Be forewarned you'll want to look up some English words - ""palantine"" instead of ""jaw"" and there are a small number of acupuncture points mentioned - as in 'tap the area to stimulate the jianjing' which I believe is GB21.

The demonstrator is a very fit man, described as 90 years old at the time of filming.

The movements are almost all easy to follow, there are a couple of places where a graphic or two would have helped, the subtitles can be reasonably detailed although they often appear and then disappears within 2 or 3 seconds, so keep the remote handy.

The routine itself is really VERY simple, not so different from various martial arts warmups and stretches I've done before, but I've never done them with the intention (""Yi"") to move energy and heal, doing them immediately after zhan zhuang practice I felt a lot of energy moving in my neck.

I paid about $5 or $6 for this title - if I'd paid $15 I'd have given it two stars.  I bought a second one from the same set I haven't watched yet.",1236470400,3,1252,4.488986784140969
