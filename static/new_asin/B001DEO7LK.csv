Use common sense and know that whenever the DVD's were produced then that is what you will get in regards to ""all episodes.""  Some of these retards have reviewed this product and expect future episodes to be included.  Don't be ignorant.  I like Family Guy and the set is awesome.",1226448000,34,364,4.373134328358209
3529103,4,B001DEO7LK,"All these people complaining about ""ripping"" fans off, or debating the titling of the product.

1) If your a ""completist"" and are one of those people who has to have every last thing marketed to show just how devout you are, then you have the bigger problem.

2) The complete collection is just what it is right now, all that you CAN collect. It is possible (as utterly remote as it may seem) that this is all that will be issued on DVD and hence collectible. So semantically it is fitly titled.

3) By marketing this in such a way, I was able to get everything already issued in one fell swoop for a great price (Gold Box for $59.99). Of course if this were at such a price because others rejected buying it for whatever reason, it then reached a price point where I, for one, snapped it up without much thought. THAT'S HOW A MARKET WORKS.

So I just get the impression that so many people are so easily insulted and angered about things that are free choice. Buy it or don't. No one is forcing you. But I'm beginning to get under the impression that people get themselves worked up, step by step, case by case, into a Business is bad and Greedy and Mother Government will settle their hash! Something has to explain why the activity of bringing a product to market, freely invested in by one party, perused and examined by another party who may or may not part with an asked price and reward the creator thereby and take possession of something they value. If you don't value it enough to part with the asking price, move on. Embittering yourself over Family Guy DVD's when less than 100 years ago people pondered how they were going to feed themselves is insane. Grow up and get a sense of perspective.",1226448000,16,1705,4.4031746031746035
3529104,5,B001DEO7LK,"Family Guy is extremely hilarious! I bought all the seasons seperately, so now I don't have to review them one at a time. I love all the characters, the plots, the dialogue, and the jokes. For those who don't know anything about Family Guy, Peter Griffin is the head of the Griffin family. He has a wife named Lois, a smart talking dog named Brian, and children named Chris, Meg, and Stewie. Stewie's a talking baby who always tries to kill his mom. He often gets into adventures with Brian. Chris is nice, but dim-witted like his dad. Meg wants to be loved, hardly anyone likes her. Lois is a typical mom who often disagrees with Peter's choices. I don't like it when they make fun of Jesus Christ, that's the only downfall. If you love comedy, and sick twisted humor, you'll love FAMILY GUY!!!",1226188800,6,795,4.489655172413793
3529105,5,B001DEO7LK,I like Family Guy because of the spoofs and the general humour. Why did they put a huge useless plastic Stewie head on a nice set?,1225584000,2,130,4.038461538461538
3529106,1,B001DEO7LK,"Not only has Family Guy not ended, but you are really not getting much for this price. I was one of those fans who signed the petitions, wore the t, and wrote Fox letters to bring back Family Guy. When they finally did, I was so happy! I thought to myself ""The creators of this show really care about their fans!"" Wow, was I wrong! Not only are they releasing a whole bunch of bad ""Half-Season"" DVDs, but then they release this garbage. Family guy is not done, so calling this the complete collection is dumb. They are releasing a new Star Wars Spoof in the future ""Something, Something, Something, Dark Side"" and they are going to make more episodes (Hopefully something funny. Maybe back to the originals?) Save your money. If you don't own Family Guy DVDs...Either get Stewie Griffin ""The Untold Story"", Volumes 1 and 2, and watch the Cartoon Network, the CW, or TBS for the rest of the episodes. Your not missing much with the rest of the episodes. Blue Harvest was okay, but not brilliant by any means.

I am very disapointed with Fox/Family Guy/Seth MacFarlane. They keep ripping people off with these sad DVDs and the show really just sucks right now. I really hope they pick it back up, but I highly doubt they will.",1224374400,21,1224,4.513513513513513
3529107,5,B001DEO7LK,I am a die hard Family Guy fan and I was just thinking of buying the seasons separately. I am so glad I found this full 6 season pack alongwith the blue harvest. This is a super value pack and a must have for any Family Guy fan who wants to own all that has ever been produced related to Family Guy.,1223856000,6,299,3.838709677419355
3529108,1,B001DEO7LK,"What a ridiculous sales ploy! How can they call this the complete collection? Does that mean season 7 is on here in its entirety also? Oh, what about seasons 8 and 9? They haven't even been created yet but I guess since this is the 'complete collection' they're in this package too. What a joke!

Do not buy this! It is not the 'complete' collection. Family Guy is still in production! Next year this thing will be incomplete.",1222646400,34,426,4.461538461538462
3529109,5,B001DEO7LK,"I love Family Guy. And as such, I've bought every season so far. But now they release this all inclusive 'box set' with a couple of limited edition items. Why do the continue to stick it to fans (not just Family Guy but other series as well). Is it really just about the money? I guess so. . I've learned my lesson and will no longer buy single season sets. I'm waiting for the ""complete series"" box sets.
That being said, anyone who doesn't have any F.G. DVD's should definitely pick this up. Constantly one of the funniest shows on TV.",1220400000,29,537,4.326732673267327
3529110,5,B001DEO7LK,This is a wonderful item and perfect gift for that Family Guy lover you know.  The Stewie head package is so cute and for the price you get so many DVD's and special episodes as well.  Everyone who sees the item wants one of their very own.  Only thing that is a drawback is finding a place that you can store it all he is pretty large and akward shaped so most shelfs in an entertainment console won't hold the head just the DVD's.,1329091200,,432,4.119047619047619

3529114,5,B001DEO7LK,"I already owned seasons one and two and blue harvest, but this went on sale and I had to have it! I hadn't bought any other seasons so this was perfect to get up to date for a fraction of the cost. The huge Stewie head is great looking and after removing the ""untold stewie griffin story"" and blue harvest I have two spaces available to add any other volumes that come out later. It is a cool set and the display case is worth the bucks, if you have three or four volumes already I wouldn't spring to buy it. But if you don't own more than two I highly encourage you to pick this up!",1279670400,,583,3.9914529914529915

3529116,4,B001DEO7LK,"Family Guy rocks.  I bought this to get all (at the time) the Family Guy DVDs.
The head is a gimmick.  It is nice but not necessary.  I would rather have a smaller case, but I got this for a SWEET deal, so that's that.",1268179200,,218,3.8
3529117,5,B001DEO7LK,"Wow, what can I say. Having moved to Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates from Canada I was a little upset that Family Guy was not shown in this country. It became apparent to me that an order had to go out to Amazon for the complete set, and with my luck it was on sale for 1/2 the retail price. Amazon delivered it almost a week before it was scheduled to arrive.
Both the Family Guy - The Total World Domination Collector set and the Vol 7 arrived and now I have everything out on DVD from the Family Guy series.

Great series and Amazon delivered ahead of time halfway around the world.",1265846400,,591,4.139130434782609

3529120,5,B001DEO7LK,"This is a product that I would recommend to any Family Guy fan.  I haven't laughed this hard at a cartoon series since I was a kid.  It really helps the humor to see the joke in it's orginal form, instead of edited or modified.",1258675200,,227,4.022222222222222
3529121,5,B001DEO7LK,"I couldn't have enjoyed this set more. All six seasons and both Family Guy movies ,My dvd players been in heaven. I recommend this set to anyone that likes to laugh. Some people complain about the price,I think it is a 100% fair. Stewies head has made a great addition to my media room. I have got to go watch it again.",1254268800,,319,4.161290322580645
3529122,5,B001DEO7LK,"The set is a giant Stewie head with Volumes 1-6 of Family Guy (4 episodes short of the full 6 seasons) inside.  The first 7 DVD sets contain all of the episodes from the pilot episode through Season 6, Episode 8 (McStroke).  To see what these episodes are, see this episode guide:
[...]

In addition, there are 2 single DVDs enclosed:
*Stewie Griffin: The Untold Story, an 88 minute special, which is essentially 3 mediocre episodes loosely strung together
*Family Guy presents Blue Harvest: A Star Wars parody (48-minutes) that's worth seeing, but probably only once

This is a great set, well worth having!  Amazon periodically has it as the Gold Box special.  It sold once for[...].  So, keep an eye out for it.

As a side note, if you don't like the Stewie head packaging, the DVDs are all stand-alone DVDs too, packaged just like the regular Family Guy volumes.  You can also remove the head and keep the DVDs stored in the base the head sits on.",1253664000,2,951,4.579881656804734
3529123,5,B001DEO7LK,"As expected, I got more than I bargained for with this package ! It goes from the very beginning all the way up to the middle of the 7th season.  The little (well, it's not so little in reality) Stewie head sitting on top of the DVD player is also pretty funny to look at.  There really isn't mush to say other than the DVDs are great, the extras are cool and the interviews are even better.  I really can't stress it enough, if you are a Family Guy fan, then you MUST GET THIS !  You won't regret it. Also, this is the unedited version, so curse words and all.

All of the seasons and movies have the same content as they do individually and then some. The Stewie head display is rather big, if it was completely hollow you could have a child run around with this on his head.

That Stewie head looking at me everyday when I eat my breakfast is priceless. Who cares of some of the current season is not included. I don't care.

I am with allot of people, I am use to buying my season in ""Season Box Sets"" but you're not getting ripped off.  This is not a complete collection; it's just the Total World Domination Collection.  It's a cool Collection to have, and when Vol. 7 comes out, you will get the rest of season 6, and only the FIRST half of season 7.

3529133,5,B001DEO7LK,"I just received my set today and couldn't be more happier with it. I already own the individual box sets for all 6 seasons but couldn't resist this set. I'm in the process of selling off my old sets so no worries there. Although the box says all 7 seasons, there are, as you already know, only six complete seasons. What I'm guessing they're referring to is the break out of season 1 which, essentially, was two seasons. Since season 7 is currently on going, there is no Season 7 set in here.

Overall, the packaging and discs are pretty much the same as the ones in the individual box sets. Nothing fancy on this except the packaging which TOTALLY ROCKS! This set is obviously more for show than anything else. If you already have the seasons then there's really no need to have this. It's a great way to show off to friends what you're favorite show is on FOX. The case itself (Stewie's Head) is actually well built. I was expecting some cheap flimsy plastic covering but it's a two piece plastic mold that's screwed together. Pretty solid if you ask me.

Considering that there will be potentiall, a lot more seasons coming out, this set isn't complete nor the be-all-end-all set. Even now, it's already outdated since season 7 will be out on DVD soon. BUT, for the true die hards, this set can't be passed up. I never even considered getting the Freakin Sweet Party set since that looks lame and cheesy. This one however, to me, is well worth the price tag.",1235001600,,1461,4.468164794007491

I am sure there will be many more laughs from the DVD's. I was lucky and purchased this at the gold box deal back in November for $59.99 which was well worth the price. I would not have purchased this for the $142.99 or $155.99 that I have seen it priced at since.",1230422400,,453,3.9239130434782608

It would only be ""complete"" up until the point the collection was compiled.  I do not find that to be its largest fault.  Instead, I hate the fact that the volumes do not come with an episode guide since in Family Guy DVDs, volumes are compiled differently than by season.

Other than the difficulty in locating specific episodes, I *love* this collection.  It comes with a lot of what I love best about Family Guy, and the Stewie head is a source of envy for my friends who are big Family Guy fans.  What's more, I was able to get it at an outstanding price for this set that makes it a much better value than buying the volumes individually ($60 as opposed to $155.... wow!)",1230422400,,782,4.358620689655172

The Stewie head neatly covers all the volumes, which are not in boxes with slimpacks but in regular DVD cases. There are anywhere between 1-3 discs a case, but there are absolutely no scratch worries whatsoever. I only wish there was a episode guide insert for the season sets, but thats a small issue from where I stand.
If there is any complaint, besides the aforementioned non-existant episode guide, it would be the Live in Las Vegas CD album is not in the case. I already own it, but with adding the album, its an increased value and you get some nice songs out of it.

3529158,3,B001DEO7LK,"I was a little disappointed with this set, for one main reason: it seems cheaply made.  Let it be known that this set is not unique from the individual volume sets in any way.  Upon opening, you will notice that each disc has the same artwork from the dvds that are in the individual volumes.  This comes as a bit of a surprise, considering that the art on the discs sometimes coincides with the art of the case behind the disc.  This is only true for the individual volume sets however.

In an effort to be clear, it looks as if the discs had simply been taken from the individual sets and put into cases for this collection.  New artwork or inserts were not printed for this collection.",1229731200,,688,4.3359375

You gotta love the giant Stewie head. However, I wish it had been designed a bit better. Perhaps the head could slide back, or swivel around to uncover the disks. If you have it on the top of a shelf or stand, it's ok. But for the rest of us who set it on a shelf, you have to take it off the shelf to lift the lid off. Sort of awkward. Still, it's good times.

And for $60?!?!?!?! How can you even beat this?! I would recommend it for the $100 too. It is essentially cheaper than buying each season individually.",1229212800,,527,4.076923076923077

3529170,2,B001DEO7LK,"Okay... Before anyone accuses me of not owning this set, rest assured that I do, in fact, own it.
The box says ""Featuring ALL 7 SEASONS of 'Family Guy' PLUS Family Guy Blue Harvest AND Stewie Griffin: The Untold Story.""  How in the world can Amazon make this claim when Season 7 hasn't even wrapped up yet?  and WHY oh WHY is Season 6 incomplete?  It's missing the last 4 episodes.  Is there some kind of ""easter egg"" I didn't find?
PLUS I didn't receive the American Dad bonus disk.  What's up with that?  Okay, so I got this cheap on the daily special, but still, I bought TWO of them (one for me, one for my son) and in my opinion, because Season 6 is not complete, it's basically worthless.  It would have been cheaper for me to simply buy seasons 4, 5 and 6.",1228003200,11,763,4.184931506849315
3529171,5,B001DEO7LK,"Since the product description covers the DVD content, there's not much to add.  Chances are you would not be buying this unless you or the recipient were already familiar with Family Guy, so there's no need for a blow by blow review of the episodes.

That leaves the overall package.  The description on amazon.com does not do it justice.  The Stewie Head package is downright impressive.  It is such a far leap from and ordinary box of ubiquitous DVD cases that it's hard not to take notice.  Make sure to look at the larger version of the product picture and look at the customer images to get a better idea.

I bought this as a gift for my son (much to the chagrin of my daughter) and I think it would make a great gift for any fan of Family Guy.",1227916800,,749,4.2695035460992905
3529172,5,B001DEO7LK,for one thing it is cheaper to buy the set rather than each individual season completely.just because it says complete it doesny mean every season on contract it means it is complete for what seasons are out on dvd and there was no petition to bring back on the air seth macfarlanes contract was up and when it was cancelled they were in the middle of contract negotiation so buy this box set and say screw you to the literalls out there so the people who say it is a rip off look through it again your probably just teenagers just trieing to be heard hears what you should do grow up and get a life see when you have a life you can see that family guy is not a life style and get your facts straight,1227398400,,700,4.079710144927536
3529173,5,B001DEO7LK,"I purchased this as a Christmas present for my son who is stationed overseas with the military. He called me a couple of days ago to let me know he got it (so much for Christmas surprises!) and he was just tickled with his gift. He loved the cool case and was thrilled to have such a complete collection. He already had ""Blue Harvest"" but as he also has a toddler it doesn't hurt to have a spare (his words, not mine). I can't believe the steal of a deal I got on the Gold Box for this...amazingly great price for the perfect present (for my son, anyway). Amazon is helping me make four young men very happy this Christmas with deals like this and the Buffy deal a few days later!",1227312000,2,680,4.159090909090909
3529174,5,B001DEO7LK,"First I wonna mention that I bought this package for the golden box price (60 dollars). totally worth it since you have to pay at least $200 if you buy the discs separately, or $170 for the original package price (currently $144 on amazon). but still if you are a big fan of the show and haven't bought any volume yet, I recommend this item for you even with the current price (again $144).

Now here is what you should know before you buy the item (I didn't know these things until I got my package):

1) on the back of the package box, they mention that the set includes all of the 7 seasons !!! (absolutely wrong)

most of you know that Fox are still running new 7th seasons episodes of family guy weekly, so it is not on DVD yet. and even the second half of season 6 is not on DVD yet.
Now, on Amazon they do mention that it includes ONLY all the 6 volumes (the whole first 5 seasons and 7 episodes of season 6). and this is the right numbers.
I don't know how this ""feature all 7 seasons of Family Guy"" got into the back of the box. but the only explanation that I could think of is that these boxes were made for Region 2 packages. Because in Region 2 (Egypt, Europe, Japan, Libya, Saudi Arabia & South Africa) season 7 DVD set mean season 5 part B & season 6 part A). for more information about how they name the released DVD's of the Show around the glob visit wikipidia and search for ""family guy dvd's""

So, don't get confused if you see that sentence on the back of you item box. this shouldn't really be a problem since you already know from Amazon product description that only 6 volumes of the show are included + movies...

2) more importantly the American dad bonus CD is not there !!!!!
but this time it is an item that they do mention on Amazon that it is INCLUDED in the set! when it is actually NOT !
read again the product description above to check on that. it is Disk # 22 (the very last one). However I found a Disk that was not mentioned on Amazon product description !!!
It is in the case of ""Stewie Griffin: The Untold Story"" and it is called ""Family Guy: Off the Cutting Room Floor"" and it has some deleted scenes of the show + 3 interviews + sketches of hand drown pictures of one episode.
and there is a discussion topic on Amazon about this issue

I did call Amazon customer service and a supervisor spoke to me after having a hard time trying to explain to the customer service guy on the line who seemed not to understand a word and told me (the supervisor) that he is gonna check with guys in the head quarter or where ever they keep the products to check if the bonus disk is included in the other boxes or not. and he said he is gonna call me back tomorrow (I will upload my review after I get his replay). However this shouldn't be a big  deal because when you buy this package you don't buy it for the American Dad bonus DVD but you buy for the Family Guy DVD's. So that

overall: beside the second issue I was satisfied with my purchase, and to those who says ""THIS IS NOT THE COMPLETE COLLECTION"" I say you are not gonna get a complete collection soon because Family guy as an animated show is not gonna stop until the viewers numbers decrease and believe me this is not gonna be soon. So, if you are a fan of the show don't wait for the complete collection....buy this one OR the ""Freakin Sweet Party"" package (same set of volumes and movies of the show but with different packaging style. I am not sure though if the bonus American DVD is missing in this package). The two set has over 100 episodes and 2 movies  (everything released so far) full of extra scenes and features that you don't get to see on TV, So on my opinion this the right time to buy a package of the show and why not buying the complete collection maybe 10 years latter.",1226966400,23,3782,4.16986301369863
3529175,5,B001DEO7LK,"I rate this item five stars, as I bought it during the second week of November 2008 (little less than a month after it came out) and got the Amazon Goldbox deal for $59.99.
This is crazy, as it includes the brand new Volume 6, which would be $20.95 (as of the writing of this post) by itself USED on Amazon.com(I bought this set new, of course). This set was only $40 more for Seasons 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 (part 1), as well as the special edition Blue Harvest (not the one with the shirt, obviously), the Family Guy movie, and a bonus disc called ""Family Guy: Off The Cutting Room Floor"".
Best deal, hands-down that you are going to get on the Family Guy Seasons/DVDs.
It includes Volume 1 (Season 1 + 2) in two two-disc standard-sized DVD cases, then, each Volume after that is put into one three-disc standard-sized DVD case, followed by Blue Harvest in a one-disc case, and the Family Guy movie (with the bonus disc) in a two-disc case. The entire head holds 9 dvd cases.
The extras on the Family Guy DVDs in general are just great, and it's the same discs here, so they're also great.
People have complained that there is no episode guide but I really don't find it to be a big deal. I'll print out one for each case - and, I do understand the opinion that in a big package like this, they should have included episode guides.
Besides that one small thing it's perfect - I also like the fact that you can simply take out the DVDs and put them on your shelf with your other DVDs if you want to. They're all standard size and have full artwork so you have the option if you want to (as opposed to someone custom cases which don't allow that because of shape).
Great deal at $59.99. If you see it used for that much on here (which you probably will see eventually) pick it up!",1226880000,,1773,4.2176470588235295

3529177,5,B001DEO7LK,"This product is very good. For those who like Family Guy very should buy this product. it is a 22-DVD set. It contains volumes from 1 to 6 plus the stewie griffin movie and the Star Wars episode where Peter is Han solo :P

3529178,5,B001DEO7LK,"First, I'd like to address the ""Complete Collection"" issue:
1. It's technically complete up to the time of its release, but more importantly
2. It never claimed to be complete.  It's Amazon that labeled it ""complete,"" and it's a mistake.  It's officially called ""The Total World Domination Collection.""  The collection itself never claims to be complete.  The title is right on the box, which lets you know that all those reviewers that gave it low scores for its incompleteness don't actually own the collection.

Personally, I think it's a wonderful collection of the first 6 seasons and two longer specials.  If it's ever on sale or on Goldbox (like it is today), it will almost invariably be cheaper than getting each season individually.

Other than that, I think the show speaks for itself.  If you've enjoyed watching the show, I believe this is a purchase that will be worth it to you.  If you're not sure about the show, I can only say that while I don't necessarily like everything about the show, it's still brightened my day more than a few times, so I would recommend it.",1226448000,87,1084,4.723404255319149
3529179,5,B001DEO7LK,"First off, I got this as a gold box deal for $59. At $59, it's hands-down worth it. In fact, I've been eying this for a while and almost bought it the other day @ $120.

Anyways. If you're looking at this, you probably already have an opinion of Family Guy. I love this show. Every show has high and low notes, and Family Guy succeeds in hitting the high notes pretty often. That being said:

The pack is pretty much everything that Family Guy is. You'd be hard pressed to find a better bundle pack as of date. Lots of shoppers seem miffed that they bought the last 'complete' set or that this isn't 'complete' because the show is still in production.

While valid points, The DVD set still is the best Family Guy collection out there. If you're a serious fan who wants a whole lot of Family Guy, this is the set for you. Read the product specs- Total run-time 2561 minutes. Holy crap! In short, this Family Guy box set is:
