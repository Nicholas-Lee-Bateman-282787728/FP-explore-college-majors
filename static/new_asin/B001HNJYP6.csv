8309185,3,B001HNJYP6,"Supposing you were healthy, handsome, smart and had a twin brother born that was mentally challanged? You make a good living, come home to visit your recently widowed father and discover not only that your brother is errand boy for what is obviously a whore house but that your father married a past conquest of yours.
That is the plot of ""Canciones de amor en Lolita's Club"". The twin brothers are played by Eduardo Noriega. He had mad other Spanish films like the famous thrillers ""The Yellow Fountain"" and ""Thesis"" but among his past movies my personal favorite is ""Open Your Eyes"".
All of these elements begin to place a great amount of pressure on this young man. For one he feels that his father is being made a fool of and his brother too. At the whore house, his younger brother has fallen for a prostitute he'll just about do anything for. The only thing they cannot do is have sex. For some reason he degree of retardation does not allow him to have an erection but all of the other motions are there. The young man is a reporter and he just identified some dangerous people that may retaliate and try to harm him. This only adds to the pressure.
Unknowingly, while this dysfunctional family reunion is taking place he is being tracked by ETA (the terrorist group he fingered). Now, the terrorist group have no clue about his reporters personal life. So, it's easy to see why they may mistake one brother for another.
The movie has lots of nudity, bad language and violence but tells a very believable story. The director of this film is well known and has other films than this one that may be better know. This however is a great movie although it does not have your traditional happy ending. Whether you rent or purchase this movie you will not be disappointed.",1255132800,,1774,4.546875
