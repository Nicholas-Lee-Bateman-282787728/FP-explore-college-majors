4112994,1,B003E4B0H6,"So glad I previewed this before showing it to children. Lead child a new orphan left in abusive foster home where kids are locked in basement and their toys burned as punishment. Santa hit by car and his magic crystal stolen while he lies in street. In one scene, the girl crawls into a fiery incinerator. Santa almost dies. What child or adult needs this kind of dark story? This is the stuff of nightmares!",1290556800,59,408,4.453333333333333
4112995,5,B003E4B0H6,I got this movie for my 2 year old and I ended up watching it when he went to bed and I absolutely loved it. Shows the true meaning of christmas =). Loved it!,1290124800,6,158,3.676470588235294
4112996,5,B003E4B0H6,"""The Search for Santa Paws"" is an adorable Christmas DVD for kids and adults of all ages.  The movie is a prequel to the 2009 movie Santa Buddies, which I have never seen and it didn't feel like I was missing anything.  It reminds me of Annie meets Christmas.  The story is about Santa Claus visiting New York City but after an accident he gets amnesia.  Then there is a group of orphans who help out and a husband/wife couple who open a wonderful toy store.  There is so much to this movie and it flows so nicely.  I put this movie on and my boys slowly started paying more and more attention, they are hooked!  I was really amazed that they like this movie since it is not animated but they saw Santa and his cute best friend Paws and couldn't stop watching.

The movie tells a tale of believing in Santa and the Christmas Spirit, helping others, and making friends.  It really is a magical movie that I know we will be watching for years to come, as well as probably throughout the year if my boys have anything to do with it!  It is especially a great DVD to get you in the Christmas mood.  I also want to add that you don't have to be a dog lover to enjoy this movie either!",1290124800,19,1179,4.149779735682819
4112997,5,B003E4B0H6,"A genuine xmas story with adorable puppies intertwined. A good way of keeping the kids (I'll admit it, and the adults) entertained.",1290124800,8,131,5.0
4112998,2,B003E4B0H6,This was a cute movie for little kids to watch. I can't see kids wanting to watch this over and over. More of a rental type.,1288656000,5,124,3.8076923076923075
4112999,1,B003E4B0H6,"This should be rated PG rather than G.  There are some very scary and very sad moments, including: a mean and neglectful foster mother in it for the money (think Dickens orphanage), Santa getting very sick, a robber stealing from Santa, and a very scary scene where first Paws and then a little girl are on a conveyor belt heading for an incinerator.  We only finished it so he could see for himself that it had a happy ending - he couldn't believe us otherwise.

I will not watch it again, and I wish I'd prescreened it rather than assuming that a Disney Christmas movie about Santa and a puppy would be a good family movie.",1511568000,,625,4.370689655172414

4113021,5,B003E4B0H6,"YAS QUEEN. This movie has got it all: talking dogs, skeevy hobos, a helpful elf, a troubled couple who cant conceive, an orphan girl who can barely talk, her orphan sidekick, and a mean woman who threatens to burn people/animals alive in an incinerator. And that mean woman also happens to be the matriarch in Meet the Goldbergs, so you know its GOOD.. Amen to this nutjob of a film. Talking dog scores 10 stars on a 5 star scale & barely-able-to-talk orphan girl scores a barrel of belly giggles on the oh my god this is painfully cute and so so simultaneously stupid meter.",1479772800,,575,4.485714285714286

I can't for the life of me see what some other reviewers see in saying this movie is ""dark or scary"". The movie definitely has an ""Annie"" feel to it but I don't think it as a negative. Great holiday family movie!",1451433600,,371,4.23943661971831
4113036,1,B003E4B0H6,"This movie is not appropriate for young children. It talks about friends and parents dying and a horrible caretaker who throws what is essentially a puppy into an incinerator.

If I could give this movie less than one star I would. I have no idea what the makers of this film were thinking.",1451088000,,290,4.471698113207547
4113037,5,B003E4B0H6,"This is an ideal film for children who are particularly sensitive.  Santa is run over by a cab, a dog is destroyed, and a wonderful sense of evil pervades.  If you have your stereo theater in your basement (a good idea, according to Barbara Bush) and a lock on the door to the upstairs, you can turn it on, leave for an hour or two, have a few drinks and come home to absolute chaos.

The mean orphanage owner Ms. Stout is giving him nightmares. She burns the orphans' toys in an incinerator, takes away ornaments left to them by their dead parents, locks children in the basement... WTF DISNEY???  I'm SO GLAD all the other reviewers posted their horrible stories of their traumatized children because that's exactly what happened to my son. Horrible.",1450396800,2,499,4.940476190476191

4113040,1,B003E4B0H6,For the life of me I don't understand all the high ratings for this movie. It is a horrible move! There is little original about the basic story (yes Annie meets Santa meets Air Bud is a good description). The casting for Santa couldn't be worse; there is nothing jolly about him. There is a certain darkness and mean spirit throughout the entire production. I can easily understand how sensitive children will get upset by watching this. Disney has tried to milk the Air Bud idea through several movies now; this one is contrived and just doesn't work.,1449878400,,553,4.653061224489796

When the children are caught with toys, a cruel woman in charge of orphans yells insults at the children and puts the toy in an incinerator and the movie keeps going back and showing the toys getting closer and closer to the fire until one toy which is a  little girl's doll is shown going up in flames. Later on the smallest orphan who is also a little girl climbs into the incinerator to retrieve a stuffed dog just as it is about to be burned and she screams for help as she herself is almost burned and is barely rescued at the last couple of seconds. I almost couldn't watch this myself; but decided to finish just because I was curious if this movie could have any happiness at all. The last few minutes are the only ones worth watching in my opinion and it does have a happy ending; but only for two of the orphans. Sadly, I wish I had never bought this movie. This is definitely not a movie for the whole family to enjoy. I didn't enjoy it and I am usually a loyal Disney fan.",1388880000,2,1067,4.204878048780488

4113115,3,B003E4B0H6,"I expected alot better of this. Although the plot is good and Santa Paws character alone is very lovable, it lacks things. For one thing, it is much too dark for a Christmas movie. The whole thing with Santapaws turning back to a stuffed animal and Santa 'dying' was all much too overkill.

If Disney was trying to make a movie more for adults, they went too overkill. I'm not sure what Disney was thinking when they made this, but they failed very badly.

And most unusual, its sequel is much better.",1387670400,,501,4.434782608695652

We enjoy many Christmas classics--Charlie Brown, Rudolph, Frosty, The Polar Express and have added Santa Paws to our yearly rotation.  Fantastic music.

4113176,1,B003E4B0H6,"This was not a feel good christmas movie. I usually preview movies or at least read the reviews. Unfortunately, I took Disney's word for it this time. The humans in this movie were sad or scary and did cruel things to each other. There was violence and scary suspense that is too intense for young children. Parents have died, santa almost dies, children and puppies almost die in an incinerator. Both of my children ended up in tears several times. Unfortunately, the characters and effects are probably not mature enough to attract older kids, but the fear factor is too much for the young ones. I cannot recommend this one.",1356220800,6,626,4.7

I mistook the title and the cover to imply that this movie would be based around dogs and happiness.  This is not the case at all, there are dogs and maybe if we had watched longer we would have encountered more dogs, but after 15 minutes my daughter asked me to stop the movie because it is too scary and way too sad.  I guess it is my fault for not previewing but I really expected a happy story line similar to the ""Air Bud"" story line than this depressing start.  Disney should place warnings on this movie and I definately don't think the ""G"" rating was appropriate, Santa getting mugged doesn't really seem like something a young child should see.",1355961600,3,734,4.297101449275362

Now I'm not going to lie, I was balling through this movie, I cried at least 5 times. At one point I was even making crying noises, not just tearing up! It is a very emotional movie. The main little girl in this movie is just phenomenal! She is the cutest little girl, she plays an orphan in this movie and I wanted to adopt her sooo bad! She made me want a little sister! She also has the voice of an angel. The singing in her is good too, it is not too much which is good and it is also very catchy. The second time I watched it, I watched it with my mom and she was hooked into it! Overall great movie no matter what your age. In fact, I might watch it again this weekend. :)",1326412800,3,856,3.787709497206704
4113220,5,B003E4B0H6,"My wife and I are the luckiest people in the world. We have the star of Santa Paws as our pet. Her real name is Sadie, she's a Great Pyrenees mountain dog, and she's now just over two years old and weighs just under 100 pounds. She's the friendliest, most lovable dog we've ever had, and we've had a bunch. We didn't become her adoptive parents until this last summer, so we missed her earlier puppy months. Watching her in the movie, though, is just like watching home movies - except for all the little kids! She had a rough beginning. After the movie, she was moved to Delaware, where the owner let her run loose. Neighbors complained, getting her to come home was a problem, so she was put in a rescue center. From there a farmer took her to guard his sheep - after all, that's her born profession. But she knew she was more than a common dog. She just slid her sequined Gucci sunglasses down from her forehead and got a little sun instead of guarding the flock. The farmer sent her back to the center. Her new owners kept her in a 10 x 12 foot pen with a 4-foot fence. She escaped. Repeatedly. Back to the center and to yet another incompatible home and back to the center. Then we picked her up. We're all happy. She has a dog buddy. His name is Blue, and he's a German Shepard mix about six months younger than Sadie. The two of them wrestle and play on our deck for a good six hours every day, and sleep ""like dogs"" all evening. They like nothing more than to be with each other. It's fun to watch them play tug-of-war, but they both have nasty habits of eating anything that isn't tied down, including the siding on our log home! She loves the cold in the winter, even though it's not all that cold here in Tennessee. At Christmas, we kept a red bow on her - she thought she was extremely special. And she is.

The movie's cool too...",1326067200,2,1843,4.220963172804533

Yes, there are some parts that younger children may find somewhat scary. My DD cried at the end, but happy tears.  All-in-all, we loved it.  The Santa is a little creepy looking, and the incinerator can be intimidating, but it has a very happy ending.",1324944000,,367,4.515151515151516
4113222,3,B003E4B0H6,"I am surprised to see how many parents(and kids) HATE this movie.  This is not much different than other Disney movies where there are ""BAD things"" involved.  Sure, I could list all of the bad things this movie shows:  A store santa passes away, santa gets hit by a taxi, a bum takes his bag and crystal necklace, girls are verbally and physically abused, the dog nearly gets burned in the fire, the girl crawls in after him, bla bla bla bla.  The thing is...  when these things are happening, you can still FEEL the Christmas spirit because they quickly cut to the following scenes.  The only scene that goes overboard with drama is the dog/fire scene.  That is the scene my daughter wanted to watch 3 times after we rented this from the Redbox.  She didn't cry, but she was worried.  She wanted to know the dog was okay and felt satisfied knowing he was saved.  That part may have been a bit much.
Anyway, this movie does an affective job of bringing you the joy and spirit of Christmas.  Some parts and/or actors seemed a little odd or inexperienced.  The girls are cute.  Santa is fine(no worse than santas at the malls).  The dogs are great in this movie and I enjoyed Santa Paws more than those ""Cats and dogs"" movies or ""Beverly Hills Chihuahua.""
 The mean woman is great I think.  And this movie does have some humor to it if you don't take things so seriously.  There are far worse movies people are watching these days.
 After watching this movie again, I realize people might over-react.  My 5 and 9 year old kids liked this movie a lot.  Although, I would suggest parents be warned that it's a bit of a soap opera for kids.",1324944000,3,1635,4.404682274247492

In short, this movie has Santa getting hit by a car, developing amnesia, being separated from his dog, becoming sick and almost dying.  Another plot line is an orphanage with a horrific guardian who doesn't allow toys, singing or anything related to Christmas. All of the children talk about hoping their dead parents will come back and the guardian punishes them by burning their family toys in an incinerator, making them spend the night in the basement as a punishment and leaving them alone for long periods of time.  There is a scene where Puppy Paws is turned into a stuffed animal and sent to the incinerator and one of the children crawls in after him to rescue him, with the fire burning.  At this point my 3yo is crying and I'm in shock.

The ""happy ending"" in no way makes up for the the horribly upsetting themes children are exposed to in this film.  I would beg parents to not buy or rent this movie for their kids.  I'm a grown woman and I was traumatized by it.  Just terrible.",1323993600,4,1210,4.390134529147982

This onset a huge dialogue with lots of disturbing questions. My daughter couldn't stop asking if there really were mean mommies that would do this to their children. I felt heartbroken I hadn't shielded my child from this -- all because I fell for the cute fluffy puppy on the cover and the ""G"" rating. This movie ought to be burned in the incinerator.

My daughter insisted that I turn it off through tears. It was just too cruel. And with no point, no redeeming quality whatsoever. This is not an ""instant classic"", but a classic failure. The dialogue and acting are almost as horrible as the songs. My mother bought it for my daughter because she saw it so many times on the Safeway aisle during Christmas.

The point in the movie when the DOG IS THROWN IN THE INCINERATOR (I don't care if looks like a toy, it was a real dog about 20 seconds earlier), she screamed ""NOOOOOO!!!"" and was sobbing. Why anyone at Disney thought that would be ok in a Christmas movie is beyond me. Disappointed does not express how I feel about it. Red-hot angry is more like it.

While some reviewers thought it too scary or sad, I found it touching and heart tugging. Kaitlyn Maher as Quinn was a wonderful choice by Disney; she was both precious and believable in the role of a newly-become orphan. There were glimpses of the ""Annie"" story in it but it had such a fresh take on the idea of love and how it overcomes everything that it really stood on its own merit. I agree that it might be too much for very sensitive younger children, especially if they have been sheltered from the greed and avarice in the world. I think that kids under the age of five might be more likely to be upset by certain events in the story, but the good always wins out. Unfortunately, we don't have a perfect world without sorrow...or fear. I think it's okay for most kids to know that, so that they are perhaps a little better prepared for reality when they are faced with it. The movie has (as other reviewers have commented) a couple of events that make the viewer a little sad or worried, but they are short events, and they turn out fine in the end. One other thought is that when some kids see this, they may even take a second look at their own life and see how great they have it compared to what others may be experiencing.

Even though I'm not a little child anymore, this story nevertheless touched my heart deeply. The music was very good, most especially where little Kaitlyn sings about wondering who will take care of her. It brought tears to my eyes! The end of the story is typical Disney, where you have the ""...and they lived happily ever after."" I adored the end.

1) A girl's parents die and Social Services has to find a place for her to live.

2) The caregiver to which she is assigned is hideously mean and does not allow the children to play with toys or to put up any decorations for Christmas; if she catches any of the children in her home playing with toys, the toys are immediately put in an incinerator and burned (and the children can hear the incinerator being activated).

3) Santa almost dies and has to be taken to the hospital in an ambulance.

4113276,1,B003E4B0H6,"Oh god, where to begin?

This movie is one of the most aimless, confused, poorly made piece's of trash I have watched in my life.  When watching 'The Search for Santa Paws' one would expect a lighthearted, silly, if predictable movie about a cute talking dog; the talking dog is the ONLY thing this movie actually has.  The plot is unfocused (remind me why that old guy showed up at the store at the beginning...), the pacing is awful (At least half an hour to get the actual story going, introducing new characters even 45 minutes in), it's full of Macguffins (Great Christmas Icicle?  Really?) and worst of all the movie has a downright depressing tone.

For a movie that centers on the concept of a talking puppy hanging out with Santa this is an insanely depressing mess, with virtually no funny or lighthearted moments at all.  I kid you not, in the first half hour there was nothing to smile about, only the movie setting up the depressing scenarios that each character is experiencing with no comic relief in sight.  Santa is hit by a car and robbed, a puppy gets lost in New York, and worst of all is the 20 minutes where the young orphan girl is dropped off in her foster home, run by a woman who treats the girls she takes in poorly (no toys, no education, worked as slaves).  What might have been intended as over-the-top evil-stepmother type came off as a very, VERY disturbing example of realistic child abuse.  Even worse was when the evil foster-mom went to burn (successfully) the little girl's toy doll; my own young daughter was hysterical.

It only gets worse from there out.  The few attempts at humor either come from racial-stereotyped street dogs, Santa's loss of memory, or from a Boy Scout proxy (introduced late in the movie, almost randomly) that is a straight rip-off of Russel from the Pixar movie 'UP'.  It was so bad that by the time one of the abused foster home girls was locked in the basement (cue my own daughter crying, again) that my wife and I decided to skip ahead to the end, so our daughter would be spared anymore understandably disturbing and scary moments and still know the good guys came out ok.  Even THAT failed, as we were faced with a lovely scene of Santa Clause almost DYING.  How's that for Christmas cheer?  Santa is in bed, sick and wasting away, one of the little girls even out right says he's going to die, and the only way he ends up living is when his dog gives up his life to save Santa (don't ask how, it's not worth explaining).  Naturally, the puppy is brought back to life again (seriously, not five minutes later), the evil foster mom loses her foster kids, and everyone live happily ever after.

Long story short:  This movie is NOT full of holiday cheer, it is a depressing mess that will very likely leave your child in tears at some point.  Stay far, FAR away.",1293667200,6,2831,4.494140625

The harm it does in the first few minutes cannot be erased from little childrens minds. A scary Santa getting hit by a car in NYC then robbed as his companion dog gets lost and alone. The scene where a child in an orphanage has doll ripped away from her by an adult in the night and then shows doll being burned in incinerator fire brought such heartbreaking tears and fear to our grandson, what were the producers thinking!! Any movie that starts out with so many horrible and frightful scenes in the intro like this did is far from my belief in films for children. I don't care where they go with it in the plot of the film, it's just way too much of scare, horror and fear for the introduction of a film for young children.

Oh, and then the orphanage is run by a woman who abuses the children, punishes them unfairly, and burns their beloved toys for no reason.

In the movie:  an old man dies, the mean headmistress throws toys - and threatened to throw misbehaving children - into the incinerator.  Self-centered toy store owner tries to profiteer off people's belief in Santa. Orphans crying for their parents. People saying Santa isn't real through the whole movie. Santa himself gets robbed, hit by a car, then he almost dies. The only way to save him is for the beloved fluffy puppy to give up his ""life-crystal"" and turn back into a stuffed animal.

Of course it ends well, but my seven year old was in tears, and my nine year old (who will watch ANYTHING) said she hated it and just wanted to go to bed.

For a movie aimed at children, this movie goes WAY TOO FAR to make the villains bad. Avoid! Avoid!

Within 5 minutes of watching though we started growing concerned.  The Santa character was not a jolly as one would hope, there was a death of an off screen character and the introduction of a clearly evil woman running an orphanage and treating the kids abusively.  Quickly I jumped out to Amazon to see what other people had said in their reviews about the movie.  Luckily we stopped the movie before Santa was run down by a car and robbed as chronicled in the other reviews.  My son has a big heart and can be kind of sensitive to these sorts of things and that would have completely freaked him out I'm sure.  If you read the other comments for this movie you can see that many others were not fortunate enough to stop the movie before the crying started.

I had to sit down and explain to a three year old that toys do not get burned when you are bad, that Santa is real and that Santa didn't really get hurt in this movie. The antagonists far outnumber protagonists in this movie. There is an incinerator where toys get burned when orphans are bad and even the orphans are threatened with being thrown in there.

4113351,5,B003E4B0H6,"I am surprised by the very polar comments for this movie, especially the negative comments.
I am giving this 5 stars from my 6 y.o child's perspective (she loved it). (maybe 4 star for me, for keeping me interested as well!)
I do recommend reading the 1-star reviews, because if you have a very sensitive child, they could be worth noting.
However, if your child is over 8 y.o, and has a hysterical reaction, you may want to consider some counseling, as they are not going to handle the world well.
If younger than 8, you'll have to judge for yourself, but I think a great many younger viewers can handle it (with varying degrees of parental guidance), and the ""darker"" aspects only make the triumphs all the more memorable.

My daughter is 6.  She has a fairly good understanding that there are good people and bad people in the world, and that bad things are a part of many peoples lives.  We have also instilled in her that these movies are make-believe.  She is still a firm believer in Santa Clause, but knows that the Santas in the movies are just pretend for the story (as I believe that many children her age also understand).  If your children do not yet make this distinction, then the movie could be more frightening for them.

The movie essentially follows many of the clich story lines (i.e. tried and true) of something bad happening to kick if off, the sweet innocent child thrust into a bad situation with bad people, wavering hope, new hope, suspense, villains to hate, little kids (and dogs) to cheer on, hardship to over-come, search and rescue, triumph, ...  all put together in a way that kept my 6 y.o. daughter extremely engaged through the entire movie.
So much so that she watched it again the next day and asked to put it on her list!
(She also enjoyed the original Santa Buddies movie, but not to where she was asking for it for repeat viewing.  ""The search for Santa Paws"" is an origin / prequel to the Santa Paws character in the Buddies movie).

There is definitely a greater sense of danger in this movie than in most children's Christmas stories (and being live action makes this more emotional), but I am also sure that it is this extra suspense and the stronger images that made this so memorable for her. (as did the Winter Warlock attacking Kris Kringle and the Burger Meister burning the children's toys in ""Santa Clause is coming to Town"", except live-action makes ""Santa Paws"" more intense and real.)
(Just as it is the suspense that that makes the more memorable Christmas movies for adults too:  E.G.: A Christmas Carol, It's a Wonderful Life, etc.)

So, it has suspense and darker images (Santa in trouble, little girls in trouble, dogs in trouble, with a little more danger than most children's stories), and happy triumphs and a happy ending (Renewed Christmas spirit, one ""bad"" person changes their ways and becomes good, while the worst character goes out on their butt. )

One note on Santa appearance:  Some said Santa looked ""scary"".  My daughter never mentioned this, so it did not seem to bother her, but I do agree that Santa's face looked odd, compared to how most of the movie Santas look.  Basically, he just has more wrinkles, particularly under the eyes.  So, if wrinkled old people scare you, .. beware.  If not, he will just be a Santa with a few more wrinkles than the old-but-unrealistically-smooth-skin of most of the Santas.  Other than that, he is perfectly jolly.",1292198400,3,3428,4.63801652892562

4113354,5,B003E4B0H6,"I think that you should be aware that there is a dark side to the film, but we loved it as my 8 year old daughter was ok with the sad parts - but in our studies we have looked at historical events from educational perspectives (the holocaust, Rwanda crisis, the bombing of Hiroshima) that make the movies dark side pale in comparison. I had more trouble dealing with the classic ""A Christmas Carol"" explaining that there is no such thing as ghosts, or at least based on my experience no ghosts that will wake you up in the middle of the night and make deals with you as you float around the world.

So, here is my review.  If you feel that your child is sensitive to the criticisms in the 1 ratings (which I wholeheartedly feel are valid) then perhaps you should wait until your child is a bit older. We loved the movie and the next day my daughter invited her friends over to watch it - they also enjoyed it cheering for Paws and yelling out advice to Quin.

It could be a valuable learning experience if you use it as a springboard to discuss orphans, unfair treatment to people, and the spirit of giving as Christmas is around the corner. It would be a good movie to watch and then donate a gift (or two) to children not so fortunate, but I do understand and want to emphasize it may not be for all children.

Discretion - but not a 1 star in my view - emphasizing awareness that there is a sad scary side (as per the reviews here: we saw the events more as an adventure within the movie).",1291939200,12,1492,4.206293706293707

Santa does get hit by a cab, and mugged, and the girls are treated awful in the orphanage.

4113358,5,B003E4B0H6,"This movie was excellent, much more interesting and sophisticated than the standard Disney. It is truly impressive that they are able to interweave so many different plots and characters together. There are cute orphans looking for parents, a greedy CPA who inherits a toy store, Santa and his dog in New York, a cruel hobo who starts to turn into Santa Claus. Yet my 4 year old and 6 year old had no trouble following the plot. Other reviewers have said that they object to the scene of a little orphan going in an incinerator. Personally, if my 4 year old daughter went into an incinerator to save a puppy, I would be pretty proud of her. Every character gets a happy ending, even the hobo and the orphans. The songs are really catchy too. This has everything I would look for in a heart-warming christmas fable.",1291593600,2,814,4.54421768707483

There were a few moments that my 4 year old and my 9 year old were a bit worried, and didn't want to see what was happening when the drama was building, but every other moment of the movie they loved. I would categorize them as a bit sensitive compared to many kids so if your kids can sit through any kids movie with a plot, they should be fine.  There is the typical Disney villain in this flick. I agree with others that there were some similarities to Annie, but also Mr. Magorium's Magic Emporium as well.

There were many good messages in the story, and all the kids acting in the movie did a great job. The dogs all had fun personalities which amused the kids AND the small group of adults we had watching the movie.",1291507200,,831,4.220125786163522

My biggest conflict with this movie is we are friends with one of the children in the movie.  My children got a kick out of watching the movie that has one of their friends in it.  So while they were frightened at times, they have watched the movie a couple times because of that, and at least know now the movie ends ok and everybody is going to be ok.  --if it were not for the friend, I would probably have deposited the movie in the trash though because of my kids initial fears..",1291420800,4,596,4.147826086956521
4113362,1,B003E4B0H6,"As others have said, this is a horrible movie. None of our children (3,6,9,11 & 13) found it enjoyable at all. The story line is exceptionally weak - we still can't quite figure out the purpose of Santa's visit to New York. There are many disturbing scenes - including Santa being mugged, hit by a taxi (and the driver flees), being robbed while he lays bleeding and unconscious in the gutter as people walk past (he only rouses after his necklace is ripped from his neck). Kids are abused and neglected (and not the usual Disney cartoon sort of neglect). The acting is weak and the requisite song and dance numbers are simply annoying. The writing is terrible - Santa Paws comes back to life with ""the magic Christmas icicle"" (huh?) and ""your love for each other and the Christmas spirit"".

I absolutely agree with the other reviewer - the Santa character is really creepy. Our eldest exclaimed ""is he wearing eyeliner? Creeeeepy!"" I can not believe that Disney couldn't manage a ""good"" Santa - too much strange makeup, weird yellowish, scraggly beard. Strange.

Really ... really ... really awful!  Not even a light Christmas movie - scary and disturbing for younger kids and beyond cheesy and very poorly done for older kids.

She has never gotten nightmares from a movie, like the scary guy in the Princess & the Frog, or the scary scenes in this movie. One thing that helps is that we always sit cuddled together, watch together, and talk about things as they happen. So she is able to process what she's seeing, and at times may be sad, but is not overly concerned, certainly not hysterical. I actually like movies that give us a chance to talk about things like this, since it seems like the more we talk about things up front, the less likely she is to have hidden fears. She has never had a nightmare to date, and so far is not afraid of monsters in her room, etc.

My daughter would give this 5 stars. She loves it and wants to watch it non-stop! She loves the songs and tried to sing along when she barely knew the lyrics. She loves seeing the orphanage transformed into a cheerful place with sparkly decorations and the girls magically getting beautiful party dresses. She is a huge fan of puppy movies, so even when the plot dragged, she was enthralled just watching Paws do his thing.

I agree with some of the critical comments: a bit dark at times, thin plot line, two-dimensional characters, lots of loose ends (what ever happens to the other girls NOT adopted away from the orphanage?!), no really wonderful and heartwarming message of the caliber of the true Christmas classics. For me, this is more of a 3-star than a 5-star, hence our combined average 4-star rating.

However, if you have a child who can handle a few dark moments, this could be just the ticket for your preschooler. Best to read all the reviews and preview it first!",1291334400,,1686,4.432258064516129

The girl in the story lives in an abusive orphanage where the head mistress proceeds to burn her toys and the other children think they will be next.  Santa gets injured, it's all very weird and you hardly even see the cute dogs.  I do not recommend this film, really for any age.",1291248000,6,573,4.071428571428571

I actually enjoy this movie & give it 4 stars. but I feel as if my 4 star 5 star comment is being over looked with out much thought on the matter but is to help a few others out. I mean really. the over acting sensitive reviewers..

Now I grew up with Disney movies & I see this movie as No different then most of Disneys timeless classics. Speaking of death & mentioning of death through out the movie, as it was too dark. I don't agree with since in the past Disney has released many titles simular to Search for Santa paws . thats Had mention death through out the entire movie even in some Films. like .( Disneys Tarzan )

there is mention & even witness of 3 deaths through out the movie. Tarzan even starts off with death, the leopard named Hunter kills kurjacks son & even in the beginning we see that he kills Tarzans parents..

The movie start off with death & ends with death

has any one seen The secret of Nimh.?

that movie also starts with unfortunate & mention of death. it also ends with death & there are mentions of death etc through out the movie

Brother Bear is also another fav of mine. where death is essential to the plot of the film. if Sitka had not died. kenai would have not became the bear & learned the moral the film was teaching at its core.

I mean can you imagine what kind of messed up story the Lion king would have carried out if there was no mention of death in the film.? it would be a horrible movie

has any one even mentioned Bambi or the Black cauldron. which death is through out these movies aswell.

as for scaring little kids. why wasn't Disneys other Christmas movie brought up. ? The Nightmare before Christmas..

what about there Halloween movie Hocus Pocus ?

What about The Great Mouse Detective. ? & the Hunchback of Notre Dame.?

Now these movie I also have on the DVD & these movies is nothing but dark. from the start to the end yet little children are watching these films. Noone had a problem with these films. these negative reviews sound hypocritical since Disney has released movies like this before.

& for people to be complaining about this film when Disney has simular films that involve children in unfortunate goings on..

these dark happenings can be found in moovies like Matilda wouldn't a school principal locking a kid up in the chokey be as simular to locking a kid in the basement for just goofing off as Matilda was in the movie.

the princibal even took away there toys & forbid there expression of fun learning.

in Annie which is simular to this film the care giver sends the orphans to bed without supper she even attempts to kidnap Annie by posing as Annies real mom , thes trying to keep her to herself. ALSO. the caregiver in Annie threatens Annie into cleaning the entire orphanage with a tooth brush & also tells her that noone would want a little orphan like her & even goes as far as to calling Annie an orphan even though she knew Annie was offended, thes hencing why she did it

in the animated movie The Rescuers which is also dealing with a small orphan girl  who is told by her care giver that she would never get adopted. & then uses to girl to her own selfish desires by almost drowning her to obtain a rare diamond

All Dogs Go To heaven is also one that I can relate to this film yet noone had a problem with it even though the film featured Drinking & Gambling dogs yet noone had a problem with it..?

this movie features nothing but death through out the movie, with Charlie & also a little orphan girl name An Marie who is getting involved with all this unfortunate events. from getting kidnaped almost shot , killed & finally ends up ill in the very end almost dying. there are also very dark scenes in this film involving the under world. Not to mention the sad ending in the end of this movie

In the movie The Lion King, which is known as the saddest movie in cinematic history. has any one brought up these movies. these are movies i watched as a child & noone to this day has a problem with these movies

I would let my nephew watch this film & hes 5. this film is no different then Disneys several other grim & dark movies. if you want to relate in real live action film

I also cried hysterics in these movies when I was 7 or 8 because thats how Disney worked theres alot of emotion in all there films..

I also cried in Lion King & in Bambi where death is particularly the main plot line in both films.. if kids don't like this movie they would not like matilda or Great Mouse detective. sense most of Disney's good movies are quite dark

This movie was absolutely adorable & had watched it twice. My mom has seen the previews of it & we just ordered it from Amazon today. The story was tear jerking & sweet. & pulled my heart strings when watching it. I actually shed a tear.

as I remember - Beauty & the Beast Enchanted Christmas was not happy sun shine aether. that was another Christmas movie that was quite dark. & despite the dark of the Disney movies. GOOD always triumphs the bad. thats one thing all kids should know & understand when watching a Disney film which I think was the moral lesson of this movie

alot of kids were hysterically crying when Lion king was at its top. over a death
I liked this movie actually but i can't speak for other younger kids. every kid is different. some in these reviews enjoy it others don't . But theirs no shame in giving it a try..

But this movie did make me cry, I cried a few times when i watched this movie.  I came to my mom in tears the other night after watching this movie & I give it 5 stars because its not as good as Santa Buddies. Santa Buddies was better.

its not that I don't like sad movies., some emotion is good. but I don't think I will be able to watch it constantly like I do several of my other DVDs.
yet I watch Lion king alot. so I guess when the urge strikes.

But Annie was a child hood fav of mine. I consider this a Christmas version of Annie. if you like Annie then there would be no problem with this movie.

But I did get it, for for reasons.

I did enjoy it, ( But santa Buddies is better)

 I'm a collector of DVDs , & mostly Disney
another reason is

because I have the four other Buddie DVDs- this being the prequel to my Christmas fav- Santa Buddies

& my mom gets all the prequels & sequels to movies that have them.. just in case I get the urge to watch them. this DVD will probably be one I don't watch but only two or three times a year , around Christmas.

But I grew up on Nightmare Before Christmas & i was 4 or 5 when i saw that & i was OK with it.

But aether way the negative reviews sound quite hypocritical
as if

Matilda
The Lion King
Bambi
The Nightmare Before Christmas
Hunchback Of Notre Dame
The Great Mouse Detective
All Dogs Go To Heaven
Annie
Robin Hood
The Black Cauldron
Tarzan
The Rescuers
101 Dalmatians
The Secret of Nimh
The Land before Time 1

All had essential peaceful sunshine story plots to them. ?

But honestly. this film was one of the best ive seen this Christmas. & I hope this review helps others whom maybe over looking the positive reviews..

I would prefer this movie is ten times better then the Hanna Montanna Garbage Disney has on DVD.

My Favorite Scene in the film is when Quinn finds Paws & takes him back to show the other children back at the orphanage. from there they break out into Sing ( I do Believe In Christmas ) which I've been singing since I first saw this movie. Paws works his Christmas magic. giving me a happy feeling when i hear the kids singing & the Christmas decorations everywhere..^^

This movie was worth my waiting. & hoping they come out with another , perhaps another Buddies film. I have all the sequels to the Buddies films when I herd that this one was coming out I couldn't wait to get it. but I must confess that Santa Buddies was by far the best when compared to its sequel.. but there both good in my opinion.

Santa Buddies I think was better

But Disney Retro Spective Please.?

Matilda
The Lion King
Bambi
The Nightmare Before Christmas
Hunchback Of Notre Dame
The Great Mouse Detective
All Dogs Go To Heaven
Annie
Robin Hood
The Black Cauldron
Tarzan
The Rescuers
101 Dalmatians
The Secret of Nimh

might want to keep kids away from these films too if this one seems as too much

But Rent this movie first. if you like it then buy it. if you don't like it you can return it to the rental place without being told after buying that you cant return it..

Rent this movie before Buying it.. as i said there are alot of Dark moments in a Disney film.

Finally , all I will say is that while The Search For Santa Paws is not a perfect film it does not but any means disserve such negative fallacy given treatment . I can see people disliking the film. But I can not see anyone giving it virtually no credit.

If you have a negative opinion in the film you should atleast acknowledge the politically of other opinions. critics like Robert Eberts often do this when reviewing a film they don't like .

This is not all a negative review I give this movie 5 stars I feel as if my review is being over looked or not even looked upon in the 5 star ratings box. so I hope this Helps others or refresh them of Disneys other classics that carried out the same Dark in the film",1291248000,2,9311,4.227555053642011
4113379,3,B003E4B0H6,"It's been said that there are only seven basic storylines for westerns. The same might be said for Christmas movies and The Search for Santa Paws is no exception. This one leans a bit toward Miracle on 34th Street, but as Santa's magic bag of story ideas started to run low, it clearly was time to ""pay tribute"" to Mister Magorium's Wonder Emporium and about eight gallons of Annie.

The interesting thing is that, of the many entries in the ""Buddies"" series, including last year's Santa Buddies, this film is less about the cute talking puppies and more about an amnesiac Santa, several adorable orphans and warm hearted yuppies.

No kidding, the little orphan girls sing a song in their room just like ""You're Never Fully Dressed Without a Smile""  and the youngest orphan sings her version of ""Maybe."" Actually the whole film is largely a musical with on-camera singing with both the orphans in New York and the elves at the North Pole. The songs and the lavish musical score are nice, though, and I'm looking for a soundtrack CD (last year, you had to buy Santa Buddies at Target to get a soundtrack) but can't seem to find one this time around.

There's even a Miss Hannigan type who burns toys, bans singing and ""takes home schooling very seriously."" Okay, why did that line have to be there? Especially when countless home schooling parents might be part of the buying public. I know she's actually lying and really making the girls work for her, but the line's still not necessary nor nice.

What's most interesting for holiday movie buffs is that the special effects, particularly Santa's sleigh flying over New York, must be more rudimentary and certainly less cumbersome to create for this modestly budgeted direct-to-DVD movie than it was back when 1985's Santa Claus the Movie used quite a bit of its multi million dollar budget on doing pretty much the same thing without the benefit of today's technology.

Disney Channel watchers will recognize a lot of actors from various shows, including Madison Pettis (who's grown up a bit since Cory in the House), John Ducey (the JONAS dad) and G. Hannelius (of Sonny with a Chance). Voicing the lead puppy is Mitchel Musso of Hannah Montana and Pair of Kings.

It's pleasant going but isn't likely to replace Dickens. But then, it isn't intended to. It's kind of like one of those store bought holiday cookie making kits. The cookies are kinda tasty, very colorful, the kids enjoy them. But they're not the same as those cookies you waited all year for to arrive from Aunt Marge.",1291248000,,2535,4.73469387755102

We love the other Buddy movies and were expecting the same fun with this one.  My son finished all his homework early so we could watch this together last night. The first thing I noticed was what a terrible job they did in casting Santa.  He has slanty eyes that make him look untrustworthy and not at all jolly. He is a sorry excuse for Santa.  Really Disney?  That was the best you could do? Secondly, the whole orphanage thing wasn't enough you had to make her a wretched human being who hates kids and who sends toys to the incinerator?  I think the worst part was that poor little girl waking up to a stuffed Santa Paws!  How frightening! A child goes to bed with a wonderful little puppy who talks to her and wakes up to find it has turned to synthetic fur and cotton?  You people are sick!

4113382,1,B003E4B0H6,"My kids have been asking repeatedly for the Santa Paws movie since they first saw the ads for it. Then a huge display appeared at our local Target store. All of the media hype led us to believe it was a heartwarming movie about cute puppies, Santa and Christmas. Instead it left my 6 and 11 year old children traumatized, crying and saying that the ""happy ending"" didn't matter because of all of the bad things they showed through the majority of the movie. Had I previewed it I would have still been disturbed by the content and shocked at the ""G"" rating; moreso I would not have let my kids watch it.

Needless to say the movie was watched once and is now being placed for sale on eBay as none of us ever want to see it again. The packaging or marketing should have an advisory that some scenes may be disturbing to young or sensitive viewers. Eight hours after watching it my children were still shocked at how something that was supposed to be fun was so distressing for them. They said Disney shouldn't be allowed to make movies like that and market them to kids.

Imagine expecting to sit down for a fun family Christmas movie, only to be horrified by images of an adult taking toys from children and burning them (yes, it actually focuses in on the toys burning in the fire), almost burning Santa Paws in the fire after he is converted back into a stuffed animal, children being mistreated and upset, Santa being hit by a taxi, Santa in the hospital with what my daughter called ""breathing tubes"" leading her to believe he was on his deathbed, and more.

I also agree that it is way too dark with barely any humor (a girl's parents die and she is sent to an orphanage that is run by an abusive headperson; Santa is involved in a hit-and-run and then mugged).  The plot is very slow and just seems to get increasingly depressing.  I was expecting the Air Buddies, since Santa Paws was in Santa Buddies.  I guess it is a spin-off instead of a Number #2 or a Sequel.  My daughter was so excited about getting this; we actually pre-ordered it. She's very disappointed and so am I.  It will definitely go towards the back of the drawer.  I'm on the naughty list for buying this one.
Update:  Unfortunately, my daughter woke up just in time for the little girl to climb into the incinerator in order to rescue a stiff/lifeless Santa Paws who is just about to burn up in the fire.  She started screaming and crying as she ran into another room--and she is a tough little girl.

A line in the movie leads my 7 year old to think Santa is going to die and I have to comfort her to tell her ok.  However the worst to me is Disney's choice to use an incinerator to show punishment and the doll burned.  This image was what was put into my daughters mind and when the dog and the little girl went into the incinerator she went hysterical thinking they were going to burn to death.  This is the image that Disney chose to present verses maybe a garbage bin and truck or something.  My child did not even know an incinerator and is now scared of it.

I think she had to see for herself that everything was going to work out as we promised it would (because it's Disney right?)

The garbage isn't bad enough, you have to burn them? And yes, Paws turning into a stuffed and stiff dog in the arms of the girl in the basement was beyond creepy. And I just knew it would eventually end up in the incinerator and be inches from burning...however I didn't expect the youngest child in the orphanage to climb in the darn thing to save it from burning... ugh. Basically you get through the movie and you're worn out from enduring all this stuff that you know isn't real, but is still hard to watch and you hate to see your child(ren) crying and upset over a movie that you thought would make them laugh and happy.

I understand that there should be lessons in movies for kids so that they see other kids don't have everything, etc. But this movie seemed bent on showing the absolute worst possible scenario throughout. It was literally pushing the envelope on many scenes that were, quite frankly, unnecessary.

I would not recommend for any kid under 13 if you must watch this, however, there are many other wonderful Christmas/Children movies out there, pass on this for the needless shock and tear jerking factor.",1290988800,7,1720,4.509615384615385
4113388,2,B003E4B0H6,"Our boy, who'll be 9 at the end of January, was able to handle this movie, but those parents who've said that it was too dark are absolutely correct. This film is far too intense for small kids. Sure, everything turns out well in the end, and some bad things have lessons behind them (take care of your toys and love them, because some kids don't have them), but all this cou;d've been achieved without too much tyke trauma. Toys burned, Paws turning into a stuffed animal about to be burned, Santa hit by a car, Santa in the hospital about to die, Paws maybe staying a stuffed dog forever to save Santa.

This is too much for the kindergarten and under crowd: above that, take it year by year. Visually, it is a treat, there are some things which kids will love here, but who needs angst for tots for Christmas?

Parents should screen this movie first.",1290988800,4,853,4.3924050632911396
4113389,1,B003E4B0H6,"I was very disappointed in this movie.  The overall concept could be cute for children but they took it too far.  I am a huge fan of the movie ""Annie.""  There are some similarities but they took the cruelty of the foster mother to another level that is not enjoyable to watch.  Burning children's toys took it too far.  Disney really missed the mark on this one.",1290902400,6,362,4.343283582089552
4113390,1,B003E4B0H6,"I purchased this movie for my three children over the weekend.  Even my 11 year old thought this movie was sad and scary, let alone my 2 other younger children.  Avoid at all costs!  Wish I could return it!",1290902400,7,206,4.230769230769231
4113391,5,B003E4B0H6,"After Reading many of the reviews on this site I was very hesitant to purchase this movie, So I rented it instead.  Many of the reviews lead me to believe that this story was a page right out of the Manson Family Christmas, which couldn't be further from the truth. Instead it's a charming story which explains how Santa Paws came to rule the North Pole with Santa. Yes, Santa gets nipped by a car, his magic crystal is stolen and he starts to become human and sick,Lets face it folks this is Disney were talking about here and there is always a tear factor involved, myself included and I'm 36 but as with every Disney movie, love, selflessness and the Christmas spirit prevail. I would highly recommend this movie for both Adults and Children alike, you won't be disappointed.",1290902400,8,778,4.557142857142857
4113392,1,B003E4B0H6,"Bought to surprise my two young children for the Thanksgiving Weekend.  They love all the ""Buddies Movies"", what a nightmare it turned into.  Think ""Ophan Annie"" meets Santa w/ memory loss.  Very sad, my 5 yr old was horribly upset, my other child wouldn't even watch it, and I cried through the entire movie.  The entire movie is dark and sad except for the last 5-10 minutes, then it's all warm and fuzzy.  To get to that point thouogh is tourture.  I'm not even keeping it, I can't return it since we already viewed it, I guess I will donate it to the library or church, I might stick my own warning label on it though, so someone doesn't experience the same thing we did.  What a horrible evening it turned into, even my husband was sad.
If you MUST see it, rent it first!!!!  I'm very disappointed with Disney on this one!!!",1290902400,8,829,4.372549019607843
4113393,1,B003E4B0H6,"Short version - Santa gets hit by a car, mugged and almost dies, gets a job in a store and passes out in front of kids and almost dies again. Puppy turns to Stuffed Animal and gets thrown into Incinerator to burn, little girl climbs in after him, New Orphan's parents died and is mistreated. Excellent Christmas Story... Not!

Longer version - My 7 yr old Daughter cried hysterically a few times during this movie. This movie should be rated PG-13, anyone who says their young kids watched this movie and didn't cry was probably because they were too young to understand what was going on or were not paying attention to it, this movie is borderline EVIL for presenting itself as a ""Instant Classic"".

At the beginning of the movie Santa hears about an old friend who has died, great kids Christmas movie moment #1...

Santa then goes to NYC, He gets hit by a car and gets robbed while laying in the street and then sent to the hospital, the Puppy that is with him is now alone, great kids Christmas movie moment #2...

The main little girl is lead into the Orphanage holding a small angel that her now deceased mom gave her, when asked by other kids where ""her"" parants were she states ""They didn't Make it"" and the other Kids think their deceased parents are coming back for them as well (all except one kid, who is the bitter one), great kids Christmas movie moment #3...

A few minutes after the excessively mean orphanage lady leaves, the little girl is on the Fire Escape holding her Angel singing ""Who will sing my song to me now?"". Later on her Angel gets taken away, great kids Christmas movie moments #4 and 5...

The orphanage boss takes their toys and all Christmas decorations and incinerates them, but this is typical orphanage behaviour so its OK.

The little girl finds the Puppy and takes him inside, the Orphanage lady takes his Christmas gem and blames bitter orphan and then sends the dog and orphan to sleep in the basement where he turns into a Stuffed animal due to the missing stone, great kids Christmas movie moment #6...

So guess who goes in the incinerator in the morning??? Yup the Puppy, but even better yet, the 1st little girl climbs into the incinerator to get the Puppy while it is on, great kids Christmas movie moments #7 and 8... and EXTRA DISNEY POINTS for showing its OK for a 5 year old kid to climb into a burning ""oven""...

Classic Christmas Story? 95 Minutes of child torture for the ""Timeless Message"" at the end? Was it even in the theaters? Seriously, does Disney know what garbage they are putting out?

I normally watch certain movies before letting my Daughter watch but this one was falsely depicted as pleasant and heartwarming... a Disney mistake I will not make again.

AVOID if you don't want to see your kid cry.",1290902400,166,2768,4.527054108216433

4113408,2,B003E4B0H6,I wish I would have read the other reviews here before my 5 year old daughter settled in to watch this movie. She had enough after Santa was hit by the car and robbed and Santa Paws got lost. I thought - it has to get better. Luckily she thought differently and said she would rather go to bed than watch anymore. After she was asleep I watched the rest and gosh...I'm glad she didn't see it...The dog and child in the incinerator would have been absolutely horrifying for her. I liked the sets at the North Pole and the Toy Shoppe but otherwise definately not for a little kid.,1290816000,7,578,4.263636363636364

4113413,1,B003E4B0H6,"I will never buy a kids movie based on the cover again!  How could you go wrong with such a cute little puppy peeking out of Santa's backpack right?  Well, what a terrible movie! My daughter cried on and off the entire movie, and my son kept talking about ways he wanted to hurt the mean people in the movie - that's the Christmas Spirit Disney!  Here are some highlights: Santa gets hit by a car, suffers from amnesia, and at the end is in critical condition in the hospital and they tell the little girl he probably won't make it.  Then the wicked woman who runs the orphanage yells and screams at little girls, does not allow them to sing, have toys, or celebrate Christmas, and punishes them by putting them in the cold dark basement overnight.  I have to say the part that really crossed the line was the cute little ""paws"" losing his ""life force"" and turning into a pretty scary looking stuffed stuffed dog that gets thrown into an incinerator by the wicked woman.  There are flames lapping all around the dog.  The little girl crawls into the incinerator, onto the conveyor belt, to rescue the dog from the flames that are lapping at his face.  Due to the subject matter, and kids not being able to understand that ""it's just a movie,"" I would say kids need to be at least first graders to watch this.  Disney, you really dropped the ball with this Christmas Flick!",1290643200,19,1372,4.434262948207171
4113414,1,B003E4B0H6,"This movie is mostly dark, sad and borrowed.  It's like Annie meets Santa Paws but where Santa Paws endears himself to a bunch of little girls, looses his power crystal and then becomes a stuffed animal that almost gets burned up in the trash.  My 5 year old ran away from the TV and put her face in the wall while my 7 year old cried her eyes out in hysterics.  Yes, the cliche ""greedy, thinking only of money"" character somehow sees the true meaning of Christmas.  However, that story has been told in much lighter and more effective ways than here.  And the message was lost on my kids who couldn't see past the terrifying plot points Disney felt they needed in order to reach a larger audience?  Such a shame.  If you haven't seen the first Santa Buddies movie, get that one.  MUCH better, nice story, nice message, fewer tears.  I hate that I spent the money on this.  Worse, I hate that my kids will have bad dreams tonight.",1290556800,43,930,4.354651162790698
4113415,1,B003E4B0H6,"My wife bought this movie based solely on the poster outside the Disney store.  She thought the dog looked cute.  This movie tries WAY too hard to please and falls short in every department.

It's got Santa... a very scary looking Santa.  In fact, he looks like one of the Geico cavemen dressed as Santa.  I don't know who did his makeup but his face is ghostly pale.  For some reason, he wears a bowler hat instead of Santa's traditional red cap.  That bothered my son and so my son began whining about it.  That bothered me.

Santa visits NYC, gets hit by a cab, gets amnesia, forgets that he is Santa Claus, and finds a job as a toy store Santa.  Of course he's great at his new job.  The toy store is run by a childless couple.  In the meantime, Santa's puppy, ""Paws"", takes shelter with some singing and dancing orphans straight out of ""Annie.""  Childless couple?  Orphans?  HOW WILL IT END?  The rest is an overly long, goose-chase for Santa and the puppy filled with more expository dialogue than you can shake your angry fist at.

By the time the littlest orphan sheds a tear and asks, ""Is Santa going to die?"" you'll be sorry you made this purchase.  It was only made worse when my son turned to my wife and tearfully asked, ""Is Santa going to die?"" in the same manner.
