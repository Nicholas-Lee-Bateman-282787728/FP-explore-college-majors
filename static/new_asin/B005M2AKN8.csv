4834097,4,B005M2AKN8,"I felt that this movie wasn't as good. This is a little bit boring in the beginning and I found that I was having a hard time staying interested in it. Philip Rhee plays a father in this and is a widower. There is a lot of action in this movie. Some how he gets mixed up with the wrong people and he has the disc that they need for counterfeiting. In the end they end up getting killed. This movie I didn't feel that it was as good as ""Best of the Best 3"".",1396483200,,456,3.8105263157894735

4834102,3,B005M2AKN8,"To date, ""Best of the Best: Without Warning"" is the last film Phillip Rhee has directed or performed in. Given his level of talent, this is disappointing, and even more so for the fact that this film ends the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Best-of-the-Best/dp/B0002O7XUE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Best of the Best</a>&nbsp;franchise on a relatively low note. It's still an okay action outing that's even better by DTV standards, but it lacks both the emotional content and the martial ingenuity of its predecessors. As a somewhat generic standalone adventure with no ties to the prequels besides its main character, ""Without Warning"" is the only real throwaway addition to an otherwise above-average franchise.

The story: martial arts instructor Tommy Lee (Rhee) finds himself pulled into a deadly money-printing scheme by the Russian mafia when he unknowingly acquires an essential data disc, putting both himself and his young daughter in danger.

Villains Tobin Bell (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/SAW-series/dp/B002R3G912/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">SAW series</a>) and Thure Riefenstein (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Crusaders/dp/B000ALM426/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Crusaders</a>) balance eachother out: Bell can give a good performance in his sleep, while Riefenstein flounders with an over-written character and his difficulty with the English language. Like Bell, Ernie Hudson (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Oz/dp/B000G6BL42/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Oz</a>) is fun to watch by default, but his detective character is a jerk for no real reason. Rhee gives his usual spotty-but-sincere performance, and in the end, he and the rest manage to entertain well enough. My problem is that few of the relationships in the film are intimate to the extent of the other films, imbuing this one with a detached, generic feeling that's amplified by a lifeless urban setting. Production values are pretty strong - even featuring some early CGI animation - but the flat camerawork makes a boring presentation of most everything.

With four fight scenes, two chase scenes, plenty shooting and a couple big explosions, this may just be the most action-packed entry to the series. However, as it tends to be when small-time action expands to Hollywood proportions, ""Without Warning"" loses some of the appealing personal grittiness from the last three pictures. The chases and shootouts are fine, sure, but let's face it: that's not what you're looking for in a movie like this. The highlight of the film is an admittedly good scene wherein Rhee takes on four stick-fighters, later wielding a fencing saber. The three other fights aren't fantastic, especially the finale with Herr Riefenstein, though admittedly they're still better than what a lot of DTV flicks offer.

While I wasn't crazy about the action scenes in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Best-of-the-Best-2/dp/B000M2DLJ8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Best of the Best 2</a>&nbsp;either, the film's superior story and personality made it a good watch, thereby making this one the worst of the bunch with relative certainty.  With that said, it's still a fair watch, especially if you're a fan of the lead star like me. I nurture a small hope that even after fourteen years of inaction, the re-releasing of this movie may generate enough interest in another sequel to correct this one's mistakes. Goodness knows the unbalanced action world of today could do with some more Phillip Rhee vehicles, so long as he's on par!",1355529600,2,3678,6.133980582524272
