1367587,5,B00004XMVR,"This wonderful record of a traditional,  Metropolitan Opera production of 1982, excels in every way. The lead singers are vocally

thrilling, their acting expressive without being excessive, and they all

look good for their roles. Cassily seems a bit mature and sometimes

his singing is not lyrically beautiful, but he is a powerful Tannhauser.

They are helped by the production,  beautiful sets by Gunther Schneider-

Siemssen, gorgeous costumes, especially for the women, intelligent

direction. The Metropolitan orchestra is most compelling under the

masterly leadership of a youthful James Levine and the chorus is glorious.

Tatiana Troyanos looks absolutely ravishing as Venus and her singing

in the first act is one of the many highlights of this rewarding DVD.",1179619200,10,773,5.466101694915254
1367588,1,B00004XMVR,"My wife and I have tickets to the Tannhauser Opera this Sunday at the LA Music Center.  To prepare, we opened this DVD and were surprised to find TWO of the #2 DVDs and (of course) NO #1 DVDs.

Damn.

I ordered another copy of this set.  Hopefully that one will have TWO #1 DVDs so I will have matching sets.

Otherwise Acts II and III appear to be a fine production.  The NY Metropolitan Opera really gets it ""Right.""",1173312000,,418,4.1625

1367591,4,B00004XMVR,"Although I prefer the Bavarian State Opera's 1995 Tannhauser production--chiefly because Waltraud Meier is such a stunning Venus--this Met production is the best ""traditional"" Tannhauser.

The costumes and scenery are rich and elaborate.  Even the Pope's staff sprouts beautifully green leaves, as the music announces the promise of renewed life for even the worst of sinners.

No singer appears to be an especially strong or weak link, although how can Bernd Weikl help but steal the show with Wagner's beautiful song to the Evening Star?

Credit must also be given to an often neglected star in opera productions:  Gil Wechsler, the brilliant lighting designer, uses light to enhance the already splendid sets with a Tuscan afternoon glow.",1160438400,16,741,5.299145299145299
1367592,5,B00004XMVR,"Tannhauser, to me is a somewhat bizarre story from the motivation/emotion point of view. Of course it has some totally splendid music, like so much else in Wagner - the Liebestod is unforgettable and soul-wrenching, the Prize Song is glorious, even the Sailors' Chorus in the ""Dutchman"" is a joy. And there's the Valkyries..and more, and more... So yes, I enjoyed this performance a lot But I couldn't help wondering how the tale might be retold from a more contemporary angle. Let's see.....

So this Mr. T is playing house with this hottie in her ""magic mountain.""  It's not really clear if this Venus really exists or if she's just some kind of mystic fantasy. But whatever, she's real enough that Mr. T is truly knackered and beginning to want OUT.

It began when Mr. T lost out in the local German Idol song contest.  A sore loser, that's when he took his trip to Adult Fantasyland.  He breaks free by finding the magic mojo words that make Venus and her nymphos disappear! He finds himself in deepest rurality, in springtime.  A little catamite-type sings a sweet tune about Nature etc. and scarpers before anything can happen to him.  Now along come a bunch of the local Hare Krishnas and their attitude really strikes a chord with Mr. T.  He is set to be all Goody Two-shoes from now on. No more nookie games!

Ahah: Here comes the local Don and his henchmen, Mr. T's former buddies. They are glad to see him back, but at first he doesn't want to join the gang again. But they tell him the Don's daughter Lizzie loved his song and really, really misses him, and being the basically horny type he is, he now follows them back to the Don's mansion.

So OK - at the Big House, Lizzie meets with Mr. T but it was not, you may say, successful. He won't give with any details of what he's been doing - no surprise there.  Any-hoo, now we get a big setpiece where all the local made men, and minor capos, and their women and all, come parading in for - yes, yet another song contest! (These are very musical hoods). They are all pimped up to heavens above, bling and more bling. The song thing is actually an improv: the Don gives out the subject: ""Love's Awakening.""

First up is Mr. T's good buddy Wolfie.  He sings a nicey-nicey-song about how love is oh-so-pure. We are wondering about possible deficiencies in his equipment - and so is Mr. T, whose basic nature asserts itself. Up he jumps and sings the praises of the ol' bedspring boogie. Everyone gets mad at this - you're not supposed to sing that out loud, especially not in front of the broads. The hoods draw blades on Mr. T. The women see a major rumble coming and leave hurriedly, except Lizzie.  She believes there's good in Mt. T (somewhere) and calms down the ruckus.  Overcome with gratitude. Mr. T reverts to holy mode and promises to make a big pilgrimage to get forgiveness for his naughtinesses.

But that means he leaves moonstruck Lizzie again....he is gone a LONG time, and in the final act, Lizzie is seen asking all the returning pilgrims for news of Mr. T - nothing. Being emotionally very fragile, she sinks into some kind of despair. Wolfie (who has secretly loved her all along) thinks she may even die from it, and how right he is. But being a musical hood, he sings a nice song about it.

Now who should Wolfie see but Mr. T, all worn and beat-up looking.  The pilgrimage was a wipeout - no forgiveness for him!  The Big Papa said that to forgive him would be as hard as for Mr. T's walking-stick to sprout leaves. (These are all seriously uptight people). So Mr. T is thinking of heading back to Hottie and her playmates. But Wolfie spoils that idea by pointing to Lizzie's funeral procession that happens to go by at just the right moment. Poor ol' Mr. T, overcome by guilt again, makes another 180 and gets all religious...and hey presto, his stick sprouts leaves!  (There is an inconsistent metaphor there, but let it pass...)

Hmm....Well, OK, I'm sure I've offended lots of Wagner fans! So, to get serious for a moment, what is this performance like? Truly excellent. If you can manage the ""suspension of disbelief"" that I've been rather cynical about, you are in for an aural and visual treat - a full-scale transition to the glorious colors and textures of the Middle Ages. The otherwordly Venusberg and the huge gathering at the song contest are astonishing. Enjoy.",1159401600,11,4358,4.526114649681529
1367593,5,B00004XMVR,"First of all, for a Wagner opera you need Wagnerian singers not just any baroque chanter and I think Richard Cassilly is excellent.  Secondly, this production is so fascinating with the details of the story such as the budding of the staff in the end symbolizing God's forgiveness.  I guarantee that if you like Wagnerian opera this will satisfy you very much.",1116460800,18,360,4.790322580645161
1367594,4,B00004XMVR,"This is not my favorite Wagnerian opera by a long shot. But it is a must own, for the simple reason that these are absolutely the best set designs ever done. The Venusberg scene is dazzlingly Bosch-ish, the entry into Wartburg looks like it stepped out of an Italian Early Renaissance fresco. A must own.",1044748800,43,304,4.545454545454546
1367595,4,B00004XMVR,"This was the most passionate opera I've ever seen.  Also, it was my first.  I wrote a thesis on Richard Wagner and studied the synopsis of the opera.  It was up to the tee.  Marton does and excellent job playing Elizabeth that the tears in her eyes led me to tear up also.  The guy who played Wolfram looked as though he didn't fully study out his lines, because of the bewildering look on his face when the camera did a close up.  Cassily was wonderful despite in Act I his hair was sticking out.  The most famous Pilgrims' Chorus was good, but I would have wanted it to be slowed down and appreciated...maybe it was a difficult piece to sing that is why the orhcestra sped it up so they could get it done and over with.  The Entry of the Guest scene was great.  Overall, I strongly recommend this.  Enjoy!",1016409600,13,807,4.25
1367596,5,B00004XMVR,"This recording of the Paris version of Tannhauser was made from performances at the Met on November 22 and December 20, 1982. It features Richard Cassilly in the title role, Eva Marton as Elizabeth, Bernd Weikl as  Wolfram von Eschenbach, John Macurdy as Hermann, Landgrave of Thringia, and  Tatiana Troyanos as Venus, among many other performers. The sets are  designed by Gunther Schneider-Siemssen. James Levine conducts. Taken as a  whole, this is a successful performance, done in a very traditional manner.  The costuming is outstanding, and the choral work deserves special  recognition. Levine's tempi are brisk but not pushed hard and the whole  opera runs for 185 minutes.  The sound quality is excellent considering the  medium and age of the recording itself. A brief synopsis but no libretto is  submitted, which is reasonable considering the opera is also subtitled in  English. In comparison to Solti's studio recording, the orchestral balance  is not as forward or aggressive, and the singing is as fine. At medium  price, this is definitely worth seeking out. Elegant packaging and  presentation. Recommended.",961113600,116,1126,5.323863636363637
1367597,5,B00004XMVR,Enjoyed very much.  Glad it was on DVD.,1438214400,,39,3.875
1367598,5,B00004XMVR,This is the production I prefer. Tannhauser has been a foundational composition of my life since the 1960s. I can watch this production over and over.,1419292800,,150,4.8076923076923075
1367599,5,B00004XMVR,I remember seeing this production at the Met many years ago.  The video cannot capture the opening scenes of Venus' cave as I recall them live.  The dancers seemed to fly and the production had my jaw on the floor.  Yet the performers are strong enough not only to sing above the large orchestra but have a great presence on this huge and magnificent set.  Richard Cassilly performs a wonderful Tannhauser who escapes the wiles of Venus to eventually achieve redemption at great cost.  Eva Marton is a beautiful and chaste Elizabeth and her beauty outshines the seductive Venus played by Tatiana Troyanos.  The ballet was engagingly erotic and licentious yet had great form and beauty.  It was complex and I remember it was impossible to take it all in when I first saw it performed.  I am so grateful to be able to view this performance again.,1417392000,4,844,4.655405405405405

1367602,5,B00004XMVR,"Because of the lovely, compelling beauty of the overture to Tannhauser, I longed to see a good performance of the entire opera.  By great good fortune, I selected the 1980s New York Metropolitan Opera's beautiful production.  I have simply loved seeing it and if I never am able to see this particular Wagner opera performed live, this does suffice.  I hope to learn or stumble upon again, the wonderful patriotic anthem that is set to the tune of the pilgrim's chorus.  I cannot imagine being happier with a purchase than I have been with this one.  I truly do love it.",1379548800,,570,4.603960396039604
1367603,4,B00004XMVR,"I bought this on the recommendation of Nicholas Reveles of San Diego University, and saw quite quickly why he liked it.

I have Georg Solti's version on vinyl, and it's always left me feeling annoyed at the social attitudes shown in the story. Levine's version brings out the two personal tragedies, Elisabeth's and Tannhauser's, probably because of the visuals, and is therefore much more satisfying to hear. There seems to be better characterisation all round, and Tannhauser's pride and arrogance are more evident.

Criticisms: the ballet is not nearly energetic enough. The Venusberg music really motors, but the ballet doesn't. It's more concerned with elegance than the sexual passion explicit in the music.

And I'm afraid I don't really like filmed stage performances. Movies are the way to go. They give much more scope for movement and space. They have better sets, too, with all due respect to the Met., whose efforts here are spectacular for stage work.

For instance, the scene where the pilgrims return and Elisabeth searches among them for Tannhauser would have been much more effective if the pilgrims had just kept walking, leaving Elisabeth increasingly distraught by the roadside as she realises Tannhauser isn't there. You can do that in a movie.",1377993600,,1266,5.131067961165049
1367604,5,B00004XMVR,"Another production from the Met that is already a classic.  First, the magnificent chorus and Levine's masterful conducting.  Second: Otto Schenk's traditional staging,  which fully satisfies visually.  Last but not least, Eva Marton, Tatiana Troyanos, Richard Cassilly, Bernard Weikl, all in glorious voice. The production dates back to 1982. I remember having attended one of the performances.  A note: my used two-disc DVD came in a CD box, no liner, no notes of any kind.  But since this is a DG/Met recording, the subtitles supply the libretto, and luckily the discs have no damage.",1371600000,2,587,5.191489361702128
1367605,5,B00004XMVR,"Several years ago, I bought the Rene Kollo, Waltraud Mayer ""Tannhaeuser"" under Zubin Mehta. Apart from the fact that Kollo had seen better days, that ""Tannhaeuser"" is so ugly and absurd that it boggles the imagination.
Ever since, I have looked for a traditional one. Although this ""Tannhaeuser"" has been around for years, I always waited for something more of recent vintage but couldn't find anything that appealed to me. So I finally decided to take the plunge. All I can say, I wish I had done so earlier.
I like everything about it: the production fits the opera like a glove; the singers are excellent - and good-looking; and there is nobody like James Levine to do Wagner's music total justice.
This production takes us back into a past where directors knew the music inside out and gave it its due and if you prefer modern gimmicks, there aren't any. But no matter how many other ""Thannenhaeusers"" you may already have, if you want to see what Wagner had in mind, you cannot go far wrong with this particular one.",1370736000,3,1021,4.6464088397790055
1367606,5,B00004XMVR,"Loved it!  It was a visual and an auditory delight.  Would enthusiastically recommend this to anyone who loves beautiful opera.  I have had an extensive collection of opera, formally on VHS and now on DVD, and this is one of my favorites.

1367609,5,B00004XMVR,"Much as I love ""The Ring,"" especially the Met production that preceded the current moveable-metal production, this Met production of ""Tannhauser"" is superb--in singing, acting, orchestration, directing, and design.  Though the opening ballet is tedious (the version Wagner had to compose for the Paris performance), the rest of this production is truly magnificent in all respects.  The remastered DVD should be treasured.",1302480000,2,422,5.790322580645161
1367610,5,B00004XMVR,"This is a wonderful performance in the Traditional style. It is a shame that there are so many performances of Wagner operas done now in the""updated"" or ""modern"" style. It is refreshing to find one done the way that Wagner wanted it performed. It would be good to find more Wagner operas performed utilizing modern technology but in the Traditional Style.",1264982400,3,355,4.836065573770492
1367611,3,B00004XMVR,"The MET's Tannhaeuser was the first of James Levine and Otto Schenk's collaborations to return Wagner to naturalistic stagings that attempted to follow the composers directions. It was also the first time the MET used Wagner's later Paris version of the score, with its expanded Venusberg scene and revised Song Contest being the principle variants. Wagner added Tristan-esque chromatic harmonies to a fundamentally diatonic score, which some musicians find a bit jarring. I've lived with scores and recordings of both versions for a two decades, and I still lean towards the earlier Dresden version.

  I saw this production a couple of times before this video was made, with much of the same cast; Leonie Rysanek as Elizabeth instead of Marton. Originally Jon Vickers was to have sung his first Tannhaeuser anywhere, but withdrew, citing his inability to reconcile with the character. Of course, this was a cover for his declining vocal resources in a role that almost nobody can sing well. James McCracken sang the premier instead. Richard Cassilly, never a first rank singer, took over the part in subsequent seasons and boy howdy, I am glad he did. The sound is not beautiful (how many Wagner tenors have beautiful voices, anyway?) In fact, before he gets warmed up, about half way through the Venusberg, his voices is rather pinched. But his phrasing and attention to word color is beautifully nuanced, and although he doesn't do a lot of physical acting, he is fully involved in and committed to his character.

  The late and very great Tatiana Troyanos is the ideal Venus: sultry and voluptuous of voice and form, and Levine milks as much from her scene as he possibly can, which means he plays it even slower than his customary broad tempi. In the very much longer Paris version of this scene seems to go on forever. The choreography of the Bacchanale is bland and trite, although the sets here are spectacular.

  When you can see them! The video was shot during live performance, so no adjustment to the lighting was made; therefore the cameras of the time were unable to handle the contrast between the well lit foregrounds and dark backgrounds: upstage distances tend to disappear into black. This is a problem in every scene. Act two, with its beautifully painted Wartburg castle interior fares a little better in terms of the action, but the frescoes are rarely visible. Fortunately, the pageantry and costumes make up for it.

  Eva Marton, then very fresh of voice, sings Elizabeth very well, but her rather mature and frumpy acting is no match for Troyanos. Bernd Weikl was in fine form as Wolfram, but the director doesn't let him make much of his character. John Macurdy, under-recorded and unfortunately little remembered these days, is a solid Landgraf. But the part of Biterolf, an aging Knight Crusader, is sung by a young man with no attempt at age make-up, making the text at this point, well, silly.

  By the time we reach the third act Maestro Levine has been reminded that the orchestra and stagehands will go into union overtime if he doesn't get a move on, and he does. This is one of very few time I can remember (another being his Fidelio after the hip surgery) when I thought he was too fast. The Pilgrims' Chorus seems rushed, Wolfram's great Song to the Evening Star...and the final peroration just zip by. Why, there isn't even a rallentando at the end. And no children's voices for the descant (too late to keep them up?). It kind of makes me feel cheated.

  This isn't a bad Tannhaueser. There are many things to enjoy. But not completely satisfying, either. If you want to experience the kind of wallop this opera can pack, go for the Colin Davis/Bayreuth version that was released last year. I'll be reviewing it soon.",1250380800,19,3762,4.815217391304348
