8384173,5,B002YE9ET8,Wonderful video!  Very helpful after a c-section.,1445644800,,49,6.0
8384174,1,B002YE9ET8,"The video contained a lot of ""here baby, sit here and watch mommy.""  I was hoping it would incorporate my baby more and be more fun for him.",1393200000,,140,4.0
8384175,5,B002YE9ET8,"I love this CD.  I went to the spa where it was founded a long time ago, before I had children.  The idea stuck with me, and now that i have core strength issues after three children, I ordered it.  I admit, I have not been disciplined to be consistent.  I think my only issue with it is the length.  I feel like 45 or so minutes is a big chunk of time for me to take with three small children (two of whom don't nap)  But, really, I love the instructor and her love for mamas.",1389052800,,477,3.865979381443299
8384176,5,B002YE9ET8,"After having three kids in under five years and working, I needed to find some time for me-- both mentally and physically.  Mamalates has been perfect.  It is the right balance of taking care of my post-delivery body (I had diastisis)and a real workout so that I feel strong and toned.  Wendy is great.  She is encouraging without being obnoxious.  I highly recommend it for busy moms-- we still need to take care of ourselves.",1275955200,,427,4.64
8384177,5,B002YE9ET8,"As a bodywork therapist who sees many mamas pregnant and postpartum, I highly recommend this program. Having a baby is an incredible life and body changing event...and yet we expect mamas to magically heal with little support. This program gives women the physical healing they need to recover and restore their bodies in a gentle and effective way. I have been doing the Pilates exercises I learned from Wendy Foster since having my son 3 years ago and feel strong and confident in my body. I actually think my core is stronger than it was before having a child!

Order this program, you won't be sorry!",1275609600,,604,4.69811320754717
8384178,5,B002YE9ET8,"I discovered pilates when I was 5 years postpartum with my son and really wish I had access to a DVD like this when I was ready to get my body back together after having a baby. This DVD is full of gentle, highly-effective techniques to increase core strength which is so essential when carrying and caring for a baby. I think Wendy is an effective communicator in explaining how each exercise will effect different muscle groups in the body. Best of all this program is designed to be done with your baby by your side. I think really any mom would benefit from increased flexibility and core strength and this is a great starting point. This all-inclusive kit would make a thoughtful baby shower gift for soon-to-be moms too.",1275091200,,726,4.592307692307692
8384179,5,B002YE9ET8,"We found this program professionally done and easy to follow. Great program for rebuilding your core after childbirth, and especially a c-section. Wendy is knowledgable and able to help you isolate the small changes you need to make to see real changes in strength and ability. We highly recommend this DVD.",1274659200,,307,5.03921568627451
8384180,5,B002YE9ET8,"This video is perfect for any new mom. The instructor is very realistic about what a new mom's body has been through, as she covers c-section recovery in addition to general reconnection to your deep ab muscles.  The video is meant to be done WITH your baby, so it's easy for mama to tone and strengthen herself in the comfort of her own home.  I give this kit  as a gift to all new Mothers, because c'mon, do they really need more onsies... give her something for HER!",1274659200,,469,4.306818181818182
8384181,5,B002YE9ET8,"In order to isolate and work those abdominal and pelvic floor muscles I needed a lot of guidance.  This video provided that for me.
I'm in pretty decent shape, but, the small concise pulses and lifts in this video give me such a terrific core workout...the soreness the next day tells me so.
I highly recommend it!",1263513600,,314,4.508771929824562
8384182,5,B002YE9ET8,"The great thing about Mamalates is that is isn't some over-arching crazy workout so you can get back to looking like a supermodel in three days. This is a well-paced, well thought out series of movements that helped my wife regain her strength and tone after birth, and she was able to do it with our baby. Brilliant! If you are looking for a low-stress workout that you don't need to schedule child-care for and actually produces solid results, this is it! Great music, too.",1261180800,,475,4.6
