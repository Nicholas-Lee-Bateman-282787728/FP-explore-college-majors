(BASED ON WHAT I'VE SEEN SO FAR, I REALLY DO WANT TO GIVE THIS ONE WITH ANOTHER ""5 STARS."" ALSO, THIS ONE IS IN A BOX, COVERED WITH CLEAR PLASTIC WRAPPING.  THE BOX SAYS IT WAS MADE FOR THE ""250 ANNIVERSARY EDITION.  HERE TOO I HAVE NOT WATCHED YET.  THE BOX SAYS: ""4 DVD'S AND HISTORIC ARCHIVES.""  ONE LITTLE ""BOOKLET"" SHOWS A GROUP OF OUR FATHERS, AND IN THE BOX BOTTOM, IT SAYS: ""MEMORABILIA BOOKLET.""  THERE IS ABOUT 10 (5 ON A SIDE) PAINTINGS OF  LITTLE PICTURES WITH MORE OF ""OUR FOR-  FATHERS,"" LIKE THEY WERE ALL TALKING ABOUT SOMETHING.  NEXT THERE IS ANOTHER ""PBS"" MOVIE THAT SHOWS MORE SIMILAR TO THE ONES I MENTIONED ABOVE.

NEXT IS A HARD PLASTIC CASE THAT HAS 3 MORE MOVIES. IN THIS BOX.  NOW I JUST READ SOMETHING THAT I JUST SAW.  AT THE END OF EACH DISC, THERE IS TWO MEN PLAYING MUSIC, AND FROM WHAT I'VE SEEN THUS-FAR, IT IS ""JAMES TAYLOR & MARK O'CONNOR.  THEN, ON THE BOTTOM OF THE BACK BOTTOM OF THE STIFF BOX IT SAYS:  A NICE COMPLIMENT.  I KNEW WHO JAMES TAYLOR, BUT I DID NOT KNOW WHO MARK O'CONNOR WAS UNTIL NOW.  (FOR ME, THAT'S MY FAVORITE OF MUSIC.!)

NEXT, THIS ONE ALSO SAYS: ""PBS.""  IT APPEARS TO BE BENJAMIN FRANKLIN'S LIFE STORY.  I HAVEN'T READ THIS ONE YET.  NEXT: IS SOMETHING I WANT TO LEAVE IT AS A SURPRISE!",1471996800,,1409,4.205992509363296

8700678,5,B00T73ARKO,"STILL VERY RELEVANT & POLISHED AFTER OVER A DECADE --- MORE CLASSIC & LESS DRAMATIC THAN RECENT DOCUMENTARY STYLES

*** NOTE:  Printing on the Collector's box and DVD cases say Full Screen which will sound like Full Frame.  However, both movies are in WIDESCREEN PRESENTATION  WITH (CC)

These two landmark documentaries LIBERTY!  THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION and BENJAMIN FRANKLIN were both produced for PBS in different years by Twin Cities Public Television and the collaborating directors Ellen Hovde and Muffie Meyer.  They are very similar in style given their origin and are condensed into a single boxed set (two separate DVD cases inside) that they are calling the 250th Anniversary Edition, Heritage Collection.  They are marking the 250 years from 1765, the year of the Stamp Act.  Though American audiences are getting used to a very dramatic style of docudrama in recent years, these products are now a little over 10 years old (1997 & 2002) and have aged well so far.  They are very polished with excellent narration and animated historian commentators.  They are proper documentaries and renowned.  There is a small amount of reenactment, and dramatization.  However, the bulk of dramatization is done by actors facing the camera in character and costume, speaking the actual words of the character which are taken from historical documents and correspondence.  There are copious amounts of this type of recital as they relate the story.  In fact, all dialog excluding the narrator and historians is from historical record.  Both documentaries are filled with scenes of gorgeous countryside, famous paintings and portraits, stately homes and palaces that enrich the feel of the story.  The boxed set also includes a packet called The American Revolution Memorabilia containing folded paper documents and paintings that are facsimiles of their famous originals.  Accompanying that packet is a memorabilia booklet with a thumbnail photo and tiny paragraph about each document or painting contained in the packet.  The packet and booklet are each DVD case sized to fit snugly in the collector's box with the movies.  With the added content, this collector's box will take up roughly the same space on your shelf as the original DVD boxes even though the LIBERTY set has been condensed into one standard DVD case.  At time of release, this $39.99 collector's set is more expensive than the two movies separately, but I highly expect the price will come down.  Here is a small synopsis of each documentary with a link so you can see their more specific Amazon pages and reviews:

THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION</a>&nbsp;-- Received a Peabody Award -- This six part series (1997) covers the 25 years from 1763 to 1788.  It is narrated by Edward Herrmann and each episode is introduced by Forrest Sawyer in a sort of PBS Masterpiece Theater.  It has underlying themes of the power of government over individual lives and the extraordinary transformation of the colonists from subjects to citizens.  It highlights more of the motivations and events pushing the country into it's own nation, rather than heavy illustrations of battles.  There are still flashes of reenactment of course.  Three discs in one standard DVD case with leafs.

&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/BENJAMIN-FRANKLIN/dp/B000BNX4N6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">BENJAMIN FRANKLIN</a>&nbsp;-- Emmy Award Winner -- This 3 part series (2002) covers many stages and aspects of Franklin's life, from humble beginnings, scientific discoveries and inventions, writer/publisher, statesman, and diplomat.  It is divided into three areas of emphasis or episodes on one disc.  Here are just a few highlights of each episode to give structure:
  Let The Experiment Begin -- Benjamin's humble beginnings running away from Boston to Philadelphia.  His time in England as a young man and somewhat a playboy.  Sobering changes and his marriage.  Increased fame as a publisher and household recognition through Poor Richard's Almanac that gets everyone quoting his witticisms.  Fame as a scientist and inventor.  Latter two push him onto the world stage.
  The Making of a Revolutionary -- Colony of Pennsylvania sends him back to England on official business regarding the founding family Penn and their influence over the region, including the fact they don't pay local taxes.  This creates an adversary in Thomas Penn and Franklin must deal with the corruption at court.  Stamp tax is created and there is confusion back in the colonies that Franklin was the organizer.  This threatens Franklin's political career and forces him to take a public stand against the tax from his tacit support to it's most vocal opponent.  Mention of Franklin's publication of the Hutchison letters that create a designed effect back home, but alienate him from English government.  He had always staunchly considered himself an Englishman before that.
  The Chess Master - Mission to France to secure an alliance in support of the revolution.  Politics and spy games.  Treaty with France and efforts to focus the French effort to specifically the conflict in the colonies.  Countering the efforts of adversaries both from other countries and from home.  Adams joins him in France but is horrible at the court games and socializing required to gain favor.  Backchannel communication with Britain.  Retirement back to America and his participation in the construction of the U.S. Constitution.",1431820800,27,5623,5.507009345794392
