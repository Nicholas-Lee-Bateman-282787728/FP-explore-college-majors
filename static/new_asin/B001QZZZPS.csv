3771767,4,B001QZZZPS,"This is a Janpanese story about an old man (M)living with his daughter-in-law (F), a widow in a sub-urban hillside farm.
It was a comedy comparing the milky way between a cow and a woman.  F was lonely and dreamed love about M day and night.
M knew that he had a strong feeling --- feeling of lust.  Lastly, M decided to sell the farm and told F to leave him
for good.  The farm was sold to a real-estate agent.  This very man had several encounters with M's daughter living in city.
Now, the photography.  One scene at a distant focus on M's daughter appeared to be X-rated.  Others were for fun and R-rated.
Overall, this foreign video is quite entertaining.",1271635200,2,660,4.368852459016393
3771768,4,B001QZZZPS,"A beautiful young widow lives on a farm with her aging father-in-law who is going senile. He had a favorite cow that died but who he believes is still alive. That's because the daughter-in-law takes the place of the cow every morning (in the nude of course) to be milked. The old man's daughter finds out about the situation and threatens the end everything, and the son ( a real cad who actually caused the death of the cow) wants to put his father away. This was my first experience with a serious pink film and I was stunned. As outrageous as the plot sounds (and actually is) this is a very touching and sad film about family relationships with some soft core erotica added. The acting is great, the picture quality is great, and the movie does have an emotion punch.",1269561600,4,771,4.436619718309859

3771770,1,B001QZZZPS,"A movie should move which is not the case. I have impression the director never visited Tokyo either. We, of course, never see main chick naked and her position as a cow is the only redeeming value in all movie. Yes, my imagination never goes that far. She actually expect old fart take advantage of her but never gives him blue pill for good measure. The movie is plain boring and my guess is Japanese not into movies for some unknown reasons and I should say they cannot jump from  2-d dimentional art to 3-d.",1254700800,,511,4.378947368421053
3771771,5,B001QZZZPS,"Who can expect the story about a young widow who lets her father-in-low milk her is such a great!? The storyline is prety weied and some of you guys might think it is a kind of bad joke. BUT it is not. the story goes into their serious relationship including forbidden love. The father-in-low is senile, and he can't recognize his favorite cow is already dead. The daughter feel pity of the father, and she really loves him, so she pretends a cow every morning...
What an odd idea! But the director did really fine job. Goto has truly cinematic sense. I want to emphasize this is not comedy but pure, touching, surprising and overwhelming love story.",1254182400,16,650,4.564102564102564
3771772,4,B001QZZZPS,"A most unusually themed `pink' wherein, Ryoko Asagi puts in a great performance as she successfully convinces us that she covers for her father-in-law's long lost cow. There are wonderfully erotic sequences and some wry humour but essentially this is a movie centred around the increasing senility of the ageing small holding owner, whose son has died and his wife played by Ryoko, has hung on in there. There is some fine cinematography, illuminating the rural scenes but this is never seeming to end gloriously and indeed in the end there is much pathos and a real sense of loss and generosity of spirit. Mind you if you are looking for fleshy sex, there is plenty here, so don't be put of by the serious side. One more film that surely could only have been made in Japan.",1247011200,42,774,4.615942028985507
3771773,4,B001QZZZPS,"Genuine Japanese Pink films are the type of films that effectively blends eroticism and a powerful narrative. It is easy to dismiss these films as ""dressed up softcore"" because of the strong sequences of graphic sex and nudity, if you do, then you would miss the message it is trying to convey. Hailed as Daisuke Goto's (Zero Woman) best film, ""A Lonely Cow Weeps at Dawn"" is a movie about love, lust and loneliness. It portrays a very odd relationship between a woman named Noriko and a senile old man named Shukichi, that borders on being disturbing but at the same time compassionate.

A 29 year old widow named Noriko (Ryoko Asagi) lives with her senile father in law, Shukichi (Horyu Nakamura) on his farm. Shukichi believes that his favorite cow, recently deceased is still alive. Trying to keep him from further heartache, Noriko pretends to be his cow and lets him milk her--a satisfying arrangement for the both of them. However, Shukichi's daughter Mitsuko (Yumeka Sasaki) discovers the bizarre relationship and threatens to put an end to it.

Written and directed by Daisuke Goto, ""A Lonely Cow Weeps at Dawn"" is truly bizarre and honestly, a little disturbing. It uses the relationship between Noriko and her father in law to portray emotions and that feelings often sneak up when you least expect it. The film's narrative is quite simple and truth be told its message is very real. One may wonder as to why Noriko would subject herself to a humiliating position, but the film does make it abundantly clear. Hideo, Noriko's dead husband died at the same time as Shukichi's favorite cow. I suppose the two feel rather dependent on each other for comfort, and they feel alienated from others. Director Goto uses the ""milking cow"" metaphor to express the need for happiness and denial from hurtful truths.

Goto also incorporates a dose of a relationship that would be frowned upon--a doctor (Haruki Jo) is having sex with his nurse, Chiriko (Sakura Mizuki). The doctor is several years her senior and such a relationship will undoubtedly be frowned upon, but their blossoming relationship says a lot to people who should go with their heart and the hell with what people think. Shukichi and Noriko's relationship is much more complex, and no doubt be more condemned. People should just mind their own business I say.

This is a Japanese pink film and one wouldn't be hard-pressed to dismiss its narrative because of the truly graphic sex scenes. The sex scenes are gratuitous and the nudity is strong. The infamous hand over the female crotch area appears to be the signature of pink films and there are scenes of semi-penetration with almost full frontal nudity that are almost highly visible. All three actresses got to show their stuff and they did look like they were enjoying the scenes of vigorous sex. Those looking for pervy kicks won't be disappointed.

Plus, the acting by our two leads is quite strong. Ryoko Asagi looks very simple but she maintains that very erotic personality. Asagi was excellent in her portrayal as the ""torned"" widow of Shukichi's son Hideo. She manages to flesh out her character with a display of sadness and raw emotion even with the film's 58 minute run time. Horyu Nakamura is somewhat funny at times but at the same time a tad repulsive, I thought Goto was challenging us to feel pity for him. Yumeka Sasaki plays the daughter who is obviously all mixed up. She was raped by the land developer, Namamitsu (Hajime Seiji) which is why she left but she still agrees to have sex with him after many years. Quite an odd turning of events don't you think?

""A Lonely Cow Weeps at Dawn"" is a different kind of art house cinema. It's easy to dismiss it as a sleazy skin flick and I think this would be the wrong approach to this film. The film does have some very human and compelling characters, even though they are a bit bizarre; one has to look past the very gratuitous sex scenes to appreciate its engaging narrative. The film's final act maybe easily misunderstood, but I thought it added a whole new level in emotional impact and an exercise in the proper morals--giving up your own happiness for someone's welfare. Sad, bizarre but truly bold in its execution, and while not a film for everyone, I did enjoy the film.

Recommended timidly [3  + Stars]",1239321600,95,4301,4.748326639892905

I don't think it requires a knowledge of Japanese culture to understand the social pressures of 'appearances' and the need to preserve a persons notoriety / reputation in a community, which is what this film is ultimately about.  Two people who have grown to love each other deeply, but are from incompatible generations and with too many problems.

This is film about a senile old man becoming aware that he is enabling his daughter in law into stagnating, inhibiting her from moving on with her life in the wake of the loss of her husband, and the event--the failure to situate his father into a caretaking capacity--that, in its frustrated haste, took his life.",1484265600,2,740,4.811023622047244

3771920,2,B001QZZZPS,"First of all, there is an apparent problem with the posted reviews in that some people watched a complete movie of approximately 58 minutes, and others watched an ""edited version"" of 39 minutes, which is the version I watched as stated on the listing.  There is also some difference as to whether the sex/milking scenes, in BOTH versions apparently, were ""blurred"" or not. In the version I watched they were not. Once you know which version you are watching it is easier to assess the movies qualities.  I, myself, cannot imagine that the movie would have been helped in the least in the ""art"" department by the inclusion of the more graphic sex scenes (nearly 20 minutes worth it seems) that some reviewers spoke of.  And without subtitles, which the version I watched did NOT have, the dialogue was pretty much lost to me on this one, although I could sense what was being portrayed, albeit vaguely.  As to the other criteria for the film, the directing suffered from the editing done to this particular version, the sets were very ordinary, the scenery was no more outstanding than in any other number of Korean/Japanese films, and I found what remained of the musical score to be overwrought at climactic scenes.  The primary actors were okay, not great, but half the characters
 were depicted more like caricatures than believable participants in a drama.  Going in I had some hope for this movie but that just didn't pan out.  A disappointment, but it only adds to the depth and scope of understanding and enjoyment of this film genre.",1483401600,6,1541,4.7669172932330826

3771964,1,B001QZZZPS,"I purchased this movie because it received 4 stars, the reviews were generally positive and the cost was essentially the same as renting.  However, having watched the movie, it is clear that the reviewers watched another movie or the reviewers have a financial interest in the movie because there was a big disconnect between what they said and what I saw.  The movie appears to have been edited from a normal length movie to something close to a short film done by highschoolers (not even close to the collegiate level).  This results in the movie being rushed and lacking in any real story that would make the viewer interested.  The proposed plot involves the father-in-law (FIL) and daughter-in-law (DIL) mourning the lost of the things they loved most (a cow for the FIL, and the husband for the DIL).  Both the cow and the husband were lost in an auto accident when the husband tried to forcibly remove the cow from the farm to sell it over DIL's desperate objections.  I thought the movie was a comedy but although I laughed, I laughed for the wrong reasons. The only redeeming quality in the movie is that it is so short that by the time you conclude that it is not supposed to be a comedy and is not worth your time, it is over - assuming of course, you make it through the initial scene in which the FIL attempts to milk the DIL like a cow (which I assume is the case because the breast and hands are intentially blurred out (yes, an NR movie with breasts blurred out).  Also, the movie lacks adequate explanations of crucial issues such as why the cow needed to be sold, why was the FIL attached to the cow, why did the DIL react the way she did, why we should not sue, etc..  Characters were introduced sporadically with no true relevance to the plot and no obvious purpose.  Some scenes seem to stop in midstream making one wonder if they were cut to save time and money.  And, for the adults who like to enjoy movies that include adult content, this is not the one.  Except for the questionable theme of milking a woman like a cow, this would easily be a PG movie.  There were reviewers that mentioned or suggested that the movie contained explicit adult scenes.  This is absolutely false in the movie I watched.  I was suspicious of the reviews about the quasi-pornographic nature of the movie because I have watched many ""Asian"" films and it has not been my experience that these films are that explicit, with a few exceptions.  My thoughts were that perhaps someone was very intolerant of mature themes.  The movie contained 2 scenes in which breast were blurred out (during human-cow milking) and no nudity or sex scenes. The closest ""sex scene"" was a doctor groping some woman while she was fully clothed.  It was more anti-sexual than sexual.  I don't think I can give this no stars because of the rating system but I would if I could.  In fact, this movie owes me a couple of stars for watching and a refund.  Bottom line, don't waste your time time on this movie.  There are better infomercials to watch.",1460246400,15,3026,4.5054945054945055

The most interesting part is that the story has a single theme going through it , that of selfishness . Everyone wants something , its a clever film  and of course there is humour . For adults yes , recommend it .",1378080000,3,563,4.063063063063063

3771977,4,B001QZZZPS,"The story is sad and a bit confusing, but I did enjoy it.  It would have made it a bit better if certain points were better explained, like how the son died, or why the person was so eager to purchase his property.",1364947200,,214,3.9767441860465116
3771978,4,B001QZZZPS,"This is a very provocative, interesting, somewhat disturbing, and ultimately disappointing film. It could have been a great film. It addressed the subjects of loss and redemption. It went into taboo areas openly and honestly. It, as many Japanese movies, was a bit over the top, acting wise, but still fairly restrained. The ending is perfect. It's a tale of salvation in a way. The only downside is a subplot that makes  no sense. You have this whacko moron bicycling around, bedding the old man's daughter. It adds nothing to the story. If those sequences had been left out, this would have been a masterpiece. A short one, but a masterpiece none the less.",1344470400,2,658,4.771929824561403
3771979,3,B001QZZZPS,"An interesting film, not without its' shortcoming in story and plot, however you can't help but feel sympathy for both the main characters as they struggle with their separate issues of loss.

3771980,4,B001QZZZPS,Okay cute may not be the right word but if you like pink eiga and understand Japanese culture you'll enjoy this flick.  It's not XXX by any means but its got more than enough flesh and cute Japanese girls to keep you interested.  The acting isn't stellar but I'd give them an A- just for the effort.  You'll actually identify with a couple of characters I bet.,1314144000,2,360,4.343283582089552
3771981,3,B001QZZZPS,"Granted, this movie delves into areas that aren't as uplifting as the German-language CLOUD 9, but the mere fact that a movie-maker dares to show an older adult in a sexual relationship is unique.

I heard about this first through firepointe.com and the discussions of the book Seasoned Romance, and I'm glad I ordered the DVD. At the most basic level, it is sensual at times. It's great to see an senior man actually making love, and each of the actors and actresses have nice bodies.

Glad I bought it! Now, back to CLOUD 9 for even more sexy bodies and a more normal emotional setting...",1311724800,4,590,4.556603773584905
3771982,4,B001QZZZPS,"Very interesing, kinda depressing movie.  Makes me think about life in japan a little differently from the big city life which is normally portrayed.  Just a movie that makes you think about life a little bit.  Hard to really describe this one.  Check it out for yourself.",1307750400,2,272,4.723404255319149
3771983,5,B001QZZZPS,". . . or can we even call it a porn film? Well yes, I think we can; there is a lot of explicit sex in it, not all of which in necessary to advance the plot. Still, the sex is all over well before the achingly sad ending. How many porn films leave you teary? My cinematic tastes run mainly to art films, but I do watch a few porn flics. Most of them are atrocious and I approached this one with great trepidation given its seemingly grotesque premise. Yet it turned out to be beautiful and involved characters that I cared about.

Incidentally, the blurb on the film's Amazon page says that the score is by Hajime Oba. It is actually by Handel, Ombra mai f&ugrave; from his opera Xerxes. It's presented in an arrangement, possibly by Mr. Oba, for string orchestra. Although the playing could use more polish, the music is a major contribution to the emotional depth of the film. The piece is commonly known as ""Handel's Largo.""",1284336000,7,926,4.383720930232558
