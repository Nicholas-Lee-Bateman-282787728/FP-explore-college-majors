1674160,1,B00005V9IC,"I bought this DVD because I lived by the writer/director while he filmed this movie. (In fact, his son and mine were inseparable.) I was curious to see how this would turn out. I still don't know! The plot was completely unimaginative, but that's not a crime these days. However, the lighting was so bad throughout the picture that I couldn't figure out what was happening on the screen. Matt, sorry I couldn't give you a better review, but this really needed some quality checks before you started production.",1056931200,3,510,4.741573033707865
1674161,1,B00005V9IC,"This movie sounded good until i put it in the dvd player. The person who directed it, didn't do a very good job. I felt like i was watching a half hour show off of HBO, instead of a good scary movie. The point of the movie made no sense and it really ... because the end especially .... You expected to see something come out good, but it was like starting back from the beginning of the movie again. Another thing, is that the movie left ALOT of loose ends. I would not recommend this movie to anyone unlesss you are just totally bored out of your mind, but then again, id rather take a tylenol PM and go to bed, then have to sit through another viewing of that movie.",1042502400,,669,4.075757575757576
1674162,1,B00005V9IC,"This has got to be one of the worst movies i've seen in a long time. I was mad I wasted my time watching it, as a matter of fact I turned it off half way through. There is no budget and no attempt to even try to make this movie look good or interesting or even watchable in any way. The writing, directing, acting and special effects are all bad, real bad. The only mystery here is how this movie ever got released and disributed in the first place. If you want 2 hours severed from your life then buy this movie.",1026604800,,513,3.9902912621359223
1674163,1,B00005V9IC,"Wow, it's scary.......to think that this movie actually made it on video. If this movie scares you,I'd bet X-files makes you (wet) your pants. This movie probably cost how much you pay for it. Please, spend your money on something that's worth an hour and a half of your life.",1026345600,,276,4.54
1674164,4,B00005V9IC,"Well this film is aptly titled. it's about this maniac going around chopping off peoples head's and using them I guess in some satanic/voodoo ritual. The guy doing all the killing is like a ghost in the flesh the way he moves. The cops are stumped & helpless to stop him, they then enlist the aid of a ex-mercenary with the help of an arthopoligist? privvy to voodoo rituals. Well not a bad movie lots of suspense,severed heads and tired actors(from all that ""exorcise""
chek it out",1022025600,,481,4.540229885057471
1674165,1,B00005V9IC,"I will make this short and sweet. This movie looks like it was
filmed with a dollar budget by college students, which it probably was. The acting is horrible, the movie is just bad.",1018137600,2,181,4.352941176470588
7956269,2,B00005V9IC,"Yes, SEVERED is a low-budget piece of crap -- but I still enjoyed it.

(If you want it, you can buy it cheaper as part of several DVD sets, including&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bloody-Murder-Bloody-Murder-2-Junior-Severed-Children-Of-The-Living-Dead-Creepy-Crawlers-Deadly-Species-Carnivore/dp/B0085H66LW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bloody Murder, Bloody Murder 2, Junior, Severed, Children Of The Living Dead, Creepy Crawlers, Deadly Species, & Carnivore</a>.)

Anyway, in SEVERED, there's this serial killer chopping off people's heads. The cops are stumped. So they call in a bounty hunter -- a former FBI agent who was ""kicked out of the bureau.""

The bounty hunter teams up with a voodoo store owner (or is it a restaurant?) played by wrestling ""star"" Vanessa Sanchez.

Sanchez can't act, but neither can anyone else in this film. The sets are pretty cheap too. The ""police station"" looks like an empty high school at night.

The serial killer turns out to be practicing voodoo. That's why he's cutting off heads. It's not an original idea for a film. Yet SEVERED held my interest.

One of the film's ""strong points"" is its inadvertently atmospheric lighting. I say inadvertent, because many of the scenes are not only dark, but so murky it's hard to see anything. So I'm assuming that the lighting was an inept as much else in this film. Even so, it works. Especially in the candlelit scenes, when you can at least see something.

A much better serial killer/headhunter/voodoo film is the aptly names&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Headhunter/dp/630152635X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Headhunter</a>, starring the much superior Kay Lenz.",1366329600,,1733,6.136363636363637
7956270,2,B00005V9IC,"In reviewing this, I am taking into account this is a B movie made with little or no budget...and it's still really bad. The script is awful. I can divorce myself from reality quite a bit, but some parts were just too stupid. The cops hire a bounty hunter to help them solve a serial murder case? The guy then hands over key crime scene evidence to someone he barely knows for the night, telling her to just give it back later? So much for chain of custody! The banter with the two patrol officers at the beginning includes one of them being surprised a brand new sports arena was built in the town he lives in and streets he patrols daily, and seems shocked to see it later when they drive by the huge stadium. The bounty hunter says in one scene ""I forget why I do this"", then gets a huge wad of cash for bringing a guy in, and says something like ""Now I remember."" Then in the next scene he is explaining he's had his phone shut off because he could only afford the phone or beer money. I laughed, but none of these things were supposed to be funny. The actors were really trying the entire time and most failed miserably. Whoever played the bad guy was actually pretty good...which made all the other horrid acting seem even worse. The severed heads were so unrealistic it was pathetic. I gave this two stars just because I felt bad, and I did chuckle a few times, so I guess that's worth something.",1298851200,,1403,4.2781954887218046
7956271,1,B00005V9IC,"I'm tempted to write some clever exaggeration about how bad this was... but this film is not worth the effort.  Instead, I will stick to the facts.  I am over 50 years old, but this is the first movie that I was unable to view in its entirety.  I was only able to tolerate 15 minutes or so.  And I even like ""Santa Claus Conquers the Martians"".",1250553600,,344,4.08955223880597
7956272,1,B00005V9IC,"Severed (Matt Green, 2002)

I've seen many bad movies this year, as I do every year, but I'm not convinced that I have seen any that have been worse than Severed, Matt Green's straight-to-video Vanessa Sanchez (ex-WCW) vehicle that combines serial murder, voodoo, and New Age claptrap into something that I'm not sure it's possible to fully describe-- or even define-- without the liberal use of expletives.

The plot, if I can call it that: a serial killer is beheading victims in a nameless big city. A cop named Martin Blake (Peter Reh, in his first, and to date final, screen appearance) is getting nowhere trying to catch this guy until he runs into a fortune teller, Evangelina Lavoue (Sanchez), who puts him on the right track. I'm sure that, while watching the movie, I saw how the two of them get together; two days later, while writing this, I can't remember.

What I do remember about this dog is how very, very bad it is. The quality, on every level, is pathetic. One other review I read called it [...] quality, and that's right on the money. The film stock, the acting, the script, the music, all looks very familiar if you happen to own the collected works of, say, Ginger Lynn. The only problem is, there's a decided lack of money shots. And plot. (Yes, I've seen the occasional [...] film that has a better plot than this.) I mean, come on, a fortune teller who doesn't know how to lay out a basic tarot card reading? Yeah, that I remember. (zero)",1199318400,,1464,4.537878787878788
7956273,1,B00005V9IC,"I ran a movie review website called ""The Severed Head Movie Review"" from about 1994 to late 1999.  I reviewed movies in the theaters, on video and even had a few independent movie makers submit their movies for review.  This was one of those idependent movies that I received in the mail.  It was also the last movie I ever reviewed.  I was pretty exicited about reviewing it as it was called Severed.  That excitement quickly vanished.  This movie was terrible.  Poor acting all around.  Terrible script.  Bad audio throughout.  Now I see that they actually released it to the public.  Dear Lord what were they thinking?  It is amazing that they actually got someone to put money into this garbage.  The only half way decent acting was the guy doing the autopsy.  But even his character was just an old cliche.  I got this movie for free and it wasn't worth opening the mailbox for. So please, if you love your family, do not bring this horid attempt at a movie into your home.",1141516800,,978,4.508571428571429
7956274,2,B00005V9IC,"With a title like Severed and being a horror movie fan, I bought this movie. A bit disappointing. Some voodo, but basically the movie is about a FBI agent who sets out to destroy a serial killer they name the Head Hunter. The Head Hunter is known for decapitating people and must be stopped. There is some gore in this movie but overall, a bad attempt to make a good horror flick. I bought this movie cheap, thank goodness but I would recommend anyone interested in this film to rent it! and not spend the money to buy it!",1141171200,,522,4.282828282828283
7956275,2,B00005V9IC,"First of all, this movie is so poorly lit it's hard to tell what's going on most of the time.  The plot or what little there is centers on a serial killer who is actually some kind of voodoo god, who goes around decapitating people..sometimes the people he beheads are worthless people; other times he just grabs somebody because he needs a soul.  Matt Green (who also directed VICIOUS) employs little true suspense, settling for a couple of long pointless foot chases, a hilarious ATV chase and the obligatory car chase that is about as exciting as My Mother the Car.  Vanessa Sanchez, Peter Reh, Nehemiah and Mark Harris are the stars and their acting abilities together couldn't equal one Sasha Mitchell (and he's pretty bad).  The only reason for 2 stars is the movie does manage a neat twist at the end.  Otherwise, SEVERED joins the list of movies that Mystery Theater wouldn't even have fun with.",1108598400,,903,4.689873417721519
7956276,1,B00005V9IC,"This movie sucks, big time ... though sadly this isn't the worst I've seen (*cough* Dark Heaven, Kill By Inches *cough*) but this is severely bad.
If you like low budget, boring horror films, this is the one for you.  Other than that, don't waste your time or money unless you want to see for yourself how bad this movie really is.",1089676800,3,331,4.338709677419355
7956277,1,B00005V9IC,My brother and I rented this one evening because we wanted to watch a horror movie. I guess we picked the worst one possible. Was the director serious...I don't get it. My friends and I could film something better. What a stinker. Good for a laugh if nothing else though. The opening scene is especially funny. It would take $ in triple figures for me to sit through it again however.,1063324800,,384,4.422535211267606
