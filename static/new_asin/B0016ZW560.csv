8264240,5,B0016ZW560,"Even though I am an experienced guitarist, Pete's teaching approach is logical and builds chord knowledge in a systematic, digestible, and very enjoyable way.",1501718400,,158,5.625
8264241,3,B0016ZW560,ok for a cold winter night ...,1426032000,,30,3.4285714285714284
8264242,5,B0016ZW560,"If you're stuck playing chords in the first position, this is your ticket up the neck ;)

As others have pointed out, this is geared toward advanced beginners and intermediate level players. It will give you a solid understanding of open chords, bar chords, and moveable closed chord shapes. I have had this dvd for years and still go back to it from time to time for a refresher and to use the practice exercises. I just bought a new copy because I gave my last one, like the 2 before it, to a friend who wanted to expand their rhythm playing and use more of the neck.

 Pete Huttlinger is one of those rare world class players that can teach effectively, he explains things clearly and thoroughly without boring you to death in the process.  This is a must have for any guitar instruction video collection ;)",1413849600,3,810,4.452702702702703
8264243,5,B0016ZW560,"Pete sure goes through most of the chords that one ever need to play up to an ""accomplished"" level.  He's just a great teacher!",1413504000,,127,4.291666666666667
8264244,1,B0016ZW560,This sucks. He goes way to fast and the DVD is not broken up into sections so you can go and work in certain areas. AVOID,1407369600,,121,3.6923076923076925
8264245,2,B0016ZW560,"Nothing much more here than what you can get for free from chord charts available on the internet.  I'd love to see the theory behind the chords...especially how to substitiute and invert chords effectively and how to build interest/color with chord selections.

A disappointing waste of money.",1353542400,2,294,5.23404255319149
8264246,5,B0016ZW560,"I teach intermediate and advanced fingerstyle and this is a resource I suggest to all my students that they need to own. It's helped me with my technique and expanded my playing...this video will expand a student's understanding of how chords are formed, altered, and how scale degree relates to chord formation.

After learning what's shared here, a person should be able to construct chords, and figure them out in several places up the fingerboard beyond the first 4 frets.

This is definitely intermediate material, but a good resource for advanced beginners as well. A knowledge of major scales, and how chords relate to keys helps...",1309824000,6,639,5.018867924528302
8264247,5,B0016ZW560,"another great in a series of instructional DVDs by Pete Huttlinger.  Clearly for the intermediate guitarist, Pete Huttlinger's drive for perfection is contagious.  Learning chords and derivitives is very exciting.  Just like his other DVDs, this one is well filmed, and Pete's dry humor comes across as usual.  He is both a gifted performer and a gifted teacher.",1217808000,9,362,5.189655172413793
