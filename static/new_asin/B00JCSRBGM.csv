If you are new or avid cyclist, your will  become an expert at adjusting your derailleurs.  The video is very detail in explaining step by step process on how to adjust the derailleurs.  Also, the video has chapters on troubleshoot your drive train.  The DVD will save you money and your bike will be well tuned.

8649771,5,B00JCSRBGM,"If you want to be able to work on your bike but you are not feeling confident about addressing problems with your derailleurs, this is a great video for you. The breakdown of information is thoughtful and and the processes of working on your system are taken start to finish. The sound and video quality are also excellent, making it easier to take what Bill is talking about on your screen and applying to what you've got on the stand in front of you. I like the computer friendly layout of the disc to be able to switch around easily from one section to another as well.",1403222400,,572,4.355140186915888

8649775,5,B00JCSRBGM,"This is not the first, but the latest in the series of Bill Mould Master Mechanic Instructional DVD's for those of us riders and mechanics interested in learning more.  You will not find a series like this for the practical bicycle mechanic.  We'd agree that Derailleur and Drive Systems are a particularly confusing mechanical area. On any given day it can be one thing or the other with all things related. As he does with his Wheel Building and other Mechanical DVD's, Bill presents a logical approach to explaining how things should work, and it's an explanation that will stick with you - Bill anticipates common and uncommon problems (as well as your reaction to those problems because he's already seen this hundreds of times), and then presents a logical framework for resolving the problem. With this DVD and others in the Bill Mould Series, it is as if you are given the gift of experience from 15 years of working on Bicycles of all sorts.  If you are serious about learning bike mechanics, get this DVD and his series. Whatever type of Bike you ride (Roadie, Trails, Casual), it's important knowledge to gain.  As Bill and those from Barnett Bicycle Institute (BBI) say, problem solving in the world of bike mechanics is not an art, it is a science. There is a sound, iterative way to perform problem recognition, problem diagnosis, problem analysis and problem resolution. Bill is not only a Master Mechanic, but a true Mentor and Teacher - he has a voice and a process which you will remember when things go sideways.

I'll disclose here that my comments are not without experience behind them.  I am a Cat III Masters Rider (52) who is a Student of Bill Mould DVD's (Wheel Building, Mechanics) and I had actually attended his Wheel Building Course in person.  My experience with Bill will let me tell you without hesitation that he is one of the most knowledgable mechanics I have met (and I have worked closely with SRAM Road Support for Pro-Cycling and USAC events). Most important though is he's a good teacher - a true mentor - he wants to pass along his experience and does so with grace. Honestly, I was always a rider first. Started off a Roadie who wanted to fix his own bikes (Seven, Look and Pinarello among them) because they were not being fixed properly. Poked around, learned stuff from books, but still wasn't anticipating or solving the problems to get me back on the road quick enough. It was Bill's guidance that motivated me to attend and graduate from the 80 Hour classroom-workbench (BRO) mechanic's class at John Barnett's BBI in Colorado Springs this past Feb.  Bill Mould provided my start to practicing and understanding mechanics after having been a long distance rider / Rouleur for the last 12 years. One can read the  written word (Calvin Jones / Blue Books @ Park Tools) & Zinn's guides, but in the end you have to get it done.....and Bill helps you get it done. A quality format with a consistent result. Invest the time, you will get the result.

Wishing you the best or as they say ""Keep the rubber side down"".",1397520000,2,3058,4.66728624535316
