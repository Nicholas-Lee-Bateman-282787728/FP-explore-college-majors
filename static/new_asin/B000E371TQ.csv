8104829,5,B000E371TQ,"I'm a Browning gun guy. My dad gave me my first gun when i was in third grade. it was a 20 gauge Auto 5, and i was hooked. 45 years later I'm still hunting with that gun (among others). Regardless of your preference in firearms, John Browning's ""fingerprint's"" are on all of them. When our country needed a certain firearm, they asked him, and he delivered. This is a very good DVD, but it only scratches the surface. The History Channel should do a several hour/night presentation of his genius.",1516060800,,496,4.461538461538462
