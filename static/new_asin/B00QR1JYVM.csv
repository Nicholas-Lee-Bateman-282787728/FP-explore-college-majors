6877585,1,B00QR1JYVM,"Lucy (Anna Moore) has stage four cancer and traditional healing methods have no effect. Her boyfriend Donnie (Liam McMahon) drags her and a group of young adults to find a healer as they end up in a cabin in the woods hunted by men and wolves. The reason why is the mystery unless you read film description on the DVD cover or elsewhere.

It would be better to watch the film without the description, except it really wasn't worth watching. The wolves were very noisy and apparently invisible as we never see them, except for that dead one on the ground. You see more of the wolf on the DVD cover, then you do in the film. The characters and dialogue were boring.

As bad as ""Silverhide"".

Oh then there are the werewolves which are killing the hunters and the others too.

The one kid ask the other kid 10 times ""who are those guy's and what do they want."" What part of ""I have no idea"" is confusing?

6877616,4,B00QR1JYVM,"My gen, older now, had to use our imaginations to see horror!  This film relies on the older method, which to me is more imaginative and provocative.  Young reviewers want the gore and guts up on the screen.  They are jaded and can't appreciate the theatre of the mind!  I liked this film because it represents the better techniques of the radio age.  It requires a part of the brain, which people of later gens don't apparently have, and that accounts for the preponderance of negative ratings.!",1438560000,12,496,4.655172413793103
6877617,2,B00QR1JYVM,"A very predictable film with lousy acting and a lot of running with threats from both ""werewolf hunters"" and werewolves that you only ever heard and never did actually see.  It was mass confusion, hysterical screaming from a couple of idiotic girls, their hyped up macho boyfriends always bickering and yelling about who's fault it was that they were all there, the hunter's strange  appearance and purpose surrounding them out in the woods ,and the background growls of the  all werewolves. Lousy thriller that I was glad when it was over!",1438473600,2,540,4.912087912087912
6877618,1,B00QR1JYVM,I have lost patience for suffering through bad acting. I can't comment much on the story line with this one either. Where has all the mediocre horror gone?

It was predictable and rather dull. There are wolf attacks and you never see any wolves? There are lots of hunters and losts of gunshots? In the middle of all kinds of strangeness and tragedy, one girl is going into jealous hysterics?  Really, these are just stock annoying characters. let's talk about bad actors and actresses. I was rooting for the invisible wolves to eat them or the bad hunters to shoot them.

8692460,3,B00QR1JYVM,"The Shattering is surprisingly good!  Well to be specific, it's very good in the first half, okay in the second and the big twist at the end wraps things up awesomely

It's about a man played by Liam McMahon who is determined to cure his girlfriend's cancer (the gorgeous Anna Moore) by bringing her-along with a group of friends- on a trip to the woods where he claims he can find the cure  Nobody wants to be here apparently, except for the boyfriend.  Everyone else either isn't interested or has anger issues.  The girlfriend is part of the humongous twist I won't spoil, and the other friends -including two women played by Elizabeth Anweis and Holly Burns- constantly fight with each other while their boyfriend just sits around.  They don't fight right now however.  Not during the car ride to the woods.

They all get along decently enough until a group of vicious hunters shoot at their car tires, forcing the young men and women to pull over and run for their lives.  Considering the girlfriend has cancer, it's odd that she's able to run so fast.  But they all make it to the log cabin... well Elizabeth is shot, but she won't get any sympathy from Holly's character.  Holly comes off like an irrationally obnoxious woman, but there's a reason.  It's because her boyfriend, Jaz Martin or Chris Jarvis (I forget which one!) has been cheating on her, and he's been cheating on Holly with... yup, Elizabeth.  Sorry Elizabeth, but Holly ain't gonna bandage that bullet wound for ya!  Of course the boyfriend is one of those players who uses women to get what he wants, and the fighting between the two girls dominates much of the first half.  Well, other than the hunters hiding behind trees outside waiting for anyone to leave the log cabin so they can shoot at them.

The hunters bring up werewolf saliva, and say that it contains the cure for eternal life.  That's a weird thing to say!  But there's a LOT of money to be made by obtaining it, which plays into the story.  One of the guys in the cabin is secretly connected to these men (Liam McMahon).  Not quite sure in what way since the story isn't explained very well, but it seems he made a deal with one of the hunters to obtain werewolf saliva and the deal went sour, so now the hunters want to kill him and everyone who arrived to the cabin with him.  So when the hunters shot at the car tires, they were waiting for Liam to show up.

So the first half of the movie is all about two girls fighting and hating each other over a boyfriend, and hunters hiding around outside.  Near the middle of the story Liam mentions a story about a little boy who went missing and was killed.  The Settlers thought the Native Americans were responsible so the Settlers attacked and slaughtered them. The Native Americans wanted revenge, with help from the wolves, and a giant werewolf finished the Settlers off.  Now the ground is home to a dangerous werewolf... with healing power in his saliva!

The story gets considerably worse when one of the hunters closes in on the home probably because he's impatient and can't stand waiting around behind trees any longer, and tosses a walkie talkie at the door.  One of the young men in the cabin picks it up, and from here the hunter barks demands while Anna reads stories lying around about a boy whose mother and father were killed by werewolves.  This is actually a really boring part of the movie.  No action whatsoever.  Nobody getting shot, nobody getting attacked (well okay, maybe a cheesy werewolf attack happens somewhere around this point) and other than some horrific stories, that's about it.

There is a huge twist involving Anna's character but I won't spoil what it is.  Let's just say it's a big unexpected surprise!  Up until this point, I was convinced somebody who can run fast through the woods while being chased by hunters wouldn't suddenly become super weak with her cancer taking hold.  At least, not in a few hours like that.  Unrealistic.  But... the big twist doesn't make that running scene relevant anymore!

Perhaps the biggest problem with this movie is that we never see the werewolf.  We see people getting attacked through the eyes of the werewolf which doesn't give me the same level of satisfaction.  It's basically the camera man running through the woods imitating a werewolf.  That's not scary to me.  Maybe it's just me but the hunters are horrible actors while the young men and women in the cabin are considerably better.  Some clarity related to how the one man (Liam) is connected to the hunters would help this movie's cause.  Some better deaths besides showing people lying on the ground attacked and mauled (some of them off-camera) would help too.

It's an okay movie, but probably not one I'd recommend.  I wonder if maybe the writers should've ditched the whole werewolf angle and just had hunters stalking and killing innocent people hiding in a cabin over a large sum of money.  Would've been better I think, since the werewolf story wasn't strong enough to carry the movie through.",1498435200,,5032,4.647791619479048
