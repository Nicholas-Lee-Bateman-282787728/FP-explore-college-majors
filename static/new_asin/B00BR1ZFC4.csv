5668185,5,B00BR1ZFC4,"THE GHASTLY LOVE OF JOHNNY X is an extremely entertaining movie, hard to categorize, yet always engaging.  Right away we see the main characters are from some distant planet, setting the mood for what is to come.  The fun really begins when we discover inner turmoil within Johnny's band of delinquent pals, banished to Earth because they won't play by the rules at home.  One of them, the gorgeous and headstrong Bliss, has abandoned the gang and stolen Johnny's Resurrection Suit, and he wants it back.  Some cult favorite actors add weight to the proceedings, including Reggie Bannister, Paul Williams and Kevin McCarthy, in his final role.  Creed Bratton of THE OFFICE is unrecognizable in his bizarre and very funny turn, and even sweet Kate Maberly gets into the action before things are over.

If you've caught this wacky gem at one of its film festival screenings, then this is the dvd you've been waiting for.  If you haven't, do yourself a favor and check it out!  I myself was - to be honest - unsure what to expect when I first saw it.  I was unprepared for the polish and professional look of the movie, and soon found myself swept along with the rest of the audience.  There are some good characterizations throughout, and lots of funny, memorable dialogue.  The sci-fi is blended with 1950s/60s style teen angst, and every now and then a musical number pops up!  All of this is fluidly handled by a fresh-faced cast, all attractive and invested in their characters.  There are goofy moments, to be sure, but at no point does anyone indulge in cheap parody.  Will Keenan, De Anna Joy Brooks, Les Williams and Jed Rowen believe every moment, making for a vastly more enjoyable film than if they were constantly winking at the camera.

Some of the attention JOHNNY X received was a result of being the last 'real' black and white movie ever made.  By that I mean it was shot on the very last of Kodak's black and white film stock, not merely filmed in color and altered to b/w after the fact.  This is a definite plus, by the way, as every frame was exquisitely shot, and b&w absolutely suits the story.  I rate this film with 5 stars whole heartedly.  That doesn't mean it is a perfect movie, necessarily, but it is perfect for me, and, I know, plenty of other people who will appreciate the quirky story and the heart and soul that is evident onscreen.  If you're still unsure, take a good look at the dvd cover.  It will give you a good idea what to expect, but there are still plenty of surprises in store!",1371254400,8,2522,4.547671840354767

This is a goofy, musical, comedy. It's a throwback to 1950's sci-fi with a dab of Beach Blanket Bingo. Accept it for what it is and you should enjoy it.",1430352000,,299,4.418181818181818

This film is just the kind of cinematic lunacy that really strikes a chord with me, and I bet if you are in the mood for a slice of something off-kilter topped off with tons of b-movie reverence it will with you too! Picture if you will a film that is equal parts Broadway show and Ed Wood film and you are getting close to just what this film has in store for you! Intergalactic juvenile delinquent Johnny X (Will Keenan) is banished to earth with his gang of hoodlums, where his prized possession, The Resurrection Suit (a wardrobe that allows the wearer to control the bodies of others) is nixed by his girlfriend Bliss (De Anna Joy Brooks), and what follows is a madcap chase punctuated by zombie rock stars, UFOs, appearances by genre legends such as Reggie Bannister (Phantasm), Kevin McCarthy (Invasion of the Body Snatchers) and musical genius Paul Williams (Phantom of the Paradise) and a ton of catchy tunes!

5668197,5,B00BR1ZFC4,"It's been a long while since I've found a new cult movie to love. The genre has been a bit of a desolate wasteland lately, so you can imagine my glee when I came across this awesometastic film. With my Prime membership I got to see it for free, and I loved it so much I bought the DVD. Admittedly, I am a cult film fanatic--if it's weirdo, bizarro or just plain creative (a hard quality to find in the cinemas these days) I'm 100% on board that train to Kooksville. And if there was a mayor of Kooksville, it may very well be Johnny X's director Paul Bunnell. The music is groovy, the look is stylish, and the performances are a hoot. It's obvious that everyone involved had a wild time making this movie. Mostly you'll wish you were cool enough to count yourself as one of the Ghastly Ones. Look, what I'm trying to say is that if you're a cult film fanatic then you'll at the very least thoroughly enjoy every minute. And if you're not, well, watch it anyway, preferably with a group of friends and a few good beers. By the end you'll find yourself buying a ticket for the cult fanatic express and when you step aboard, I'll raise my brew in good cheer and welcome you to the fold.",1402617600,2,1183,4.238938053097345
5668198,1,B00BR1ZFC4,Amazon asked me to review this movie. I only watched part of it before I fell asleep. Afterwards I had no desire to go back and see what I had missed. The story seems to be about a bunch of intergalactic juvenile delinquents who are sent to Earth as punishment. It's a 2012 movie that tries to look like it was made in the 1950's. I just thought it was a stupid movie and a waste of time.,1401926400,3,388,3.9871794871794872
5668199,5,B00BR1ZFC4,"Got our copy of the movie the other day and the whole family loved it.  The classic feel of '50's sci-fi permeated the entire film.  The musical numbers were classicly cheesy, yet are tunes you find yourself humming along to.  Even our 13 and 8 year olds were intrigued by the movie, even though they were initially leery of the B and W.  Highly recommend.",1401753600,2,356,4.430769230769231

5668202,3,B00BR1ZFC4,"This little film has taken a great deal of negative criticism both here and just about everywhere else, but I just don't have it in me to lambaste such an obvious labor of love. 'Ghastly' was made, I think, for at or around two million bucks, which is at the extreme low end of any feature film budget, whether meant for straight-for-DVD or theatrical distribution.  Yeah, I know: two million dollars is two million dollars, and a few really good movies (such as the Coen Brothers' first film 'Blood Simple') have been made for about that much or even less. The trick, I think, is that a low budget effort can't look like a low-budget effort, and this movie doesn't quite pull it off.  Why? Because musical numbers, for example, typically require innumerable takes to get it right, as I understand it, and I'm guessing the lack of funding for this project made just about every scene a one-take proposition, and it shows.

So why do I like this movie, flawed as it is? Well, Reggie Bannister is in it, for one thing. I've loved watching Reggie Bannister work ever since the horror classic 'Phantasm' back in the 70's. For another thing, it was filmed in real-deal black and white using the last of the Kodak black and white film stock. I love old-school black and white. Done right, it's an incredibly visually pleasing experience, with a grayscale nuance that digitized cameras cannot seem to reproduce, and it seems the filmmakers in this instance tried very hard to get it right.

Lastly, I loved the lead actress in this film, De Anna Joy Brooks, who played 'Bliss'.  I have never seen her in anything before and felt she brought an energy to the role which--in my view--made the movie worth watching until the end-credits rolled. If I see her name come up in anything else, I'm checking it out. She's a joy to watch.",1399852800,2,1821,4.6080246913580245

All in all a great campy piece of artwork.",1399593600,5,346,4.276923076923077
5668204,5,B00BR1ZFC4,"""The Ghastly Love of Johnny X"" is directed by Paul Bunnell & stars Troma alumni Will Keenan in the lead role. This film is a throwback to the 50's. Paul Bunnell gives the audience 35mm film in black & white, science fiction, musical, &  dark comedy all rolled into one. Follow 'Johnny X' & his misfit crew the ""Ghastly Ones,"" as they scour planet earth in search of the one thing that can save the world. Their mishaps & antics are hilarious & one for the viewer to behold. This is one of the most boisterous B movies that I have had the privilege of seeing in a while.

5668205,3,B00BR1ZFC4,A great and quirky spoof on 50-60's scifi movies. If you liked The Rocky Horror Picture show this one's worth checking out.,1399593600,,123,4.636363636363637
5668206,4,B00BR1ZFC4,"In ""The Ghastly Love of Johnny X,"" the space-rebel and alien flotsam Johnny Xavier (or as we so love to call him, Johnny X (Will Keenan) and his gang of ""Ghastly Ones"" are banished to Earth until Johnny perform one singular selfless act, (not one of Johnny's strong points). Maybe its the desert surrounds, or the classic Fords, or the 1950ish diner where most of the film takes place that causes the entire cast to break into song and dance. Maybe it's the cheesy, yet well done special effects. Either way, these numbers remind me of a bad ""Grease"" or a good ""RHPS"".

Oh, and I should mention the use of black-and-white. Simply GORGEOUS! This film reminded me of the old B-movies I used to catch at the local drive-in theater, or on the late, late shows like ""Elvira: Mistress of the Dark"" or ""Svengoolie"".

The director, Paul Bunnell, who began this project in 2004, made us wait 10 years for his masterpiece. Was the wait worth it? Hard to say. I did enjoy watching it, sitting on my sofa cramming face-fulls of popcorn. But would I pay Cinema prices? Probably not.

The cast included Reggie Bannister, who I've not enjoyed this much since""Phantasm"". We also get cameos by Paul Williams and Kevin McCarthy (in his last movie role). Mr. Bunnell even bases one character on Tor Johnson, who graced many of Ed Wood's worst films.",1399248000,3,1330,4.627118644067797

Filmed In ""Ghastly Vision"" on Very Last of Kodaks B&W film stock Plus X negative. Director Paul Bunnell spent a lot of time working hard to make you feel like you stepped back in time. It's totally fun and a bit campy but that's the whole point. It's Impossible to explain the fun in this film it's got the cool gang feel from West Side Story living in The late 50's after being banished to Earth. Living now in an episode of ""The Outer Limits'' in Black & White Pleasantville Style. The musical numbers are kinda like Little Shop Of Horrors cool and have some very memorable lyrics ""Like the kiss that never lies"" Sung by The Character ""Bliss"" it's still bouncing around in my head.
The Cinematography is excellent and the sound is superb. This film is one of those rare hidden jewels. DO not watch this film if you're gonna take it seriously. It's meant to be enjoyed in a fun musical way.

It has a super look to it filmed in scope in 2.35:1 on the very last Kodak black and white Plus X negative film stock. I like the score to the film very much. The special effects and edting are excellent too. I really enjoyed Creed Bratton as the zombie entertainer. It was very nice to see the legendary actor Kevin McCarthy and the very talented composer Paul Williams in this movie. It's a lot of campy fun and I streamed the movie here on Amazon.

5668226,5,B00BR1ZFC4,"The Ghastly Love of Johnny X is quite an unusual movie--a lot like the kind of picture you could actually have seen decades ago on a drive-in screen. The overriding science-fiction aspect is dotted with humorous, witty dialogue, minimal but highly effective special effects, moments of horror movie madness, and several unexpected song-and-dance numbers, and believe it or not, everything comes together brilliantly. It pays tribute to those genre flicks of yesteryear in visual aspects as well as characterization and plot. The story is set in contemporary times (this is obvious from certain bits of dialogue as well as some props); however, in the world of Johnny X, time has decided to stand still in many respects. Despite several amusing scenes and the inclusion of musical set pieces, Johnny X is absolutely NOT a parody. Everything is presented with great love for the material and respect for the craft. You might even describe it as suitable for the entire family, although it is in no way aimed at children. Swearing is minimal and pretty inoffensive, and violence is sometimes threatened but not really depicted at length. It's also the last of the black and white filmed movies, and an enjoyable theatrical spectacle unlike anything else on this planet.",1380672000,,1266,5.091346153846154

In 2012 it made filmmaking history as the final feature to be photographed on the last of Kodaks 35mm black-and-white Plus-X film stock. The cast includes Will Keenan (Tromeo and Juliet), Creed Bratton (The Office), Reggie Bannister (Phantasm), Kate Maberly (The Secret Garden), Paul Williams (Phantom of the Paradise) and Kevin McCarthy (Invasion of the Body Snatchers) in his final role.

5668230,4,B00BR1ZFC4,"There's simply no other movie quite like ""The Ghastly Love of Johnny X."" Is it sci-fi, a musical, a spoof, an homage, film noir, or a juvenile delinquent exploitation flick? Yes, yes, yes and all of the above. Genre purists may be put off at first because the movie is such an olio, but repeated viewings--now made possible with the DVD release--allow viewers to see how the film's varied references play off one another to create something new, totally original and certainly unique. Visually it's stunning, a worthy send-off to the last black-and-white film stock in existence. Ego Plum's score holds its own against the best of the 1950s sci-fi classics. Scott Martin's songs are a pastiche of rock-and-roll oldies, Broadway showstoppers, and MGM-style production numbers. With the exception of ""These Lips That Never Lie,"" which is an out-and-out stunner, the songs' melodies may not be instantly accessible, but listeners will catch themselves humming stray melodic riffs from the tunes for weeks. (A CD of the score and songs is also available.) The tone of the film is arch, sometimes just on the edge of parody, but director Paul Bunnell (for whom this was clearly a labor of love) keeps his cast on the same page throughout. (Clearly the actors have been allowed to have fun with their roles. Check out the extras on the DVD, especially the tongue-in-cheek Featurette for ""behind-the-scenes"" footage.) The cast make themselves totally believable as 1950s-era oddballs and outcasts. Of special note, Will Kennan as interstellar juvenile delinquent Johnny X succeeds at creating a character that's simultaneously reprehensible and completely charismatic. His love interest Bliss, played by De Anna Joy Brooks, is such a seductive, clinging vamp--especially in her scenes with her Earth ""boy toy"" Chip, portrayed by Les Williams, that I half-expected her to shape-shift at any moment into that salt-sucking creature from TV's first ""Star Trek"" episode. Creed Bratton, perhaps now best known for his self-referential role on NBC's ""The Office,"" was a member of The Grass Roots, and he brings his experiences as an actual rocker to his role as a legendary rock star who's brought back from beyond the grave. A personal favorite is actress Kate Maberly, who convincingly creates a barely-legal groupie who somehow remains wide-eyed and innocent.  Paul Williams, an Oscar-winning songwriter as well as an actor, makes a sly, comedic cameo as a dead-of-night cable talk show host, and you'll get to see veteran actor Kevin McCarthy in his last film role, albeit in a minor supporting role. In the end, this movie is unlike any you've ever seen.",1375574400,3,2645,5.1368909512761025

Since this is more of a ""cult"" type movie, with a limited audience, I'm glad I bought it for my collection.",1375142400,3,254,4.1
5668232,5,B00BR1ZFC4,"A movie I really enjoyed, including the music.  Would recommend to friends who especially like Sci Fiction, and an enlightening kind of story.  Something out of the ordinary.  Loved it.  The music I recognized from the early '60's ""BOSS SOUL"" a record made by the Rumblers that played in the first part of the movie, brought back great memories. Originally saw movie preview at Grauman's Chinese Theater.  Fun experience on that day!",1374796800,3,433,4.958333333333333
5668233,5,B00BR1ZFC4,"I wasn't sure about this one as I am not a ""musical"" fan, but this was a really, really good movie.
An excellent job by everyone involved, especially Mr. Bunnell. This movie has got a little bit of everything
and even with the cheese factor rating being a little high, it all works and holds your interest.
I even like the music!",1374624000,3,329,4.32258064516129

5668235,4,B00BR1ZFC4,"A loving homage to both the low-budget B&W SF thrillers of the 1950s AND the low-budget JD films of the 1950s as well as, I guess, Stephen Sondheim? My wife and I watched the first ten minutes of this with our mouths open, thinking, ""What the heck are we watching?""

Any movie that has Reggie Bannister, Paul Williams and Kevin McCarthy (wearing a Devo Energy Dome-inspired hat) in supporting roles gets credit just for existing.

This movie has better acting, special effects and cinematography than ""Plan Nine From Outer Space"", better continuity than ""Sharknado"", and better dialog than anything ever written by an army of trained chipmunks.",1374451200,6,644,5.009345794392523
5668236,5,B00BR1ZFC4,Nothing could be more perfect for me than a movie that combines music and sci-fi.  The movie is well directed and the cinematography is excellent.  The black and white photography couldn't be more beautiful.  The movie's stars really turn in great performances.  This movie is destined to be a classic for decades to come.  I'm so glad to have been around in this decade to appreciate it.  Wonderful movie!,1373587200,4,406,4.811594202898551
8572992,5,B00BR1ZFC4,This is A Movie Everyone Needs to see. Best sci fi/ Musical! So Funny! And Entertaining. I love this Movie So Much! Johnny X is Amazing. I loved the Retro 50s style and delinquency of JohnnyX and his Gang saving Mankind. The storyline Was so Entertaining and well scripted. I loved the Music and Dancing. It's A fun Movie and very comical. Johnny X Is Amazing! Watch this Movie!,1502236800,,378,4.492753623188406

8572994,5,B00BR1ZFC4,"This film is woefully underrated. For me it sparkles as a loving homage to the stuff I enjoyed in the 50s, when movies were honest fun and not just vehicles for the purveyance of slut and filth as they are today. It hearkens back to what Hollywood once was while maintaining technological currency. Additionally it is the last feature shot on actual black-and-white Kodak Plus-X 35mm film stock.

I predict ""The Ghastly Love of Johnny X"" will grow to become a cult favorite like ""The Rocky Horror Picture Show."" Mark my words! I have had the opportunity to see this picture in both DCP and on real 35mm film. It looks great in either medium, but the film print adds a certain hard-to-define quality that is woefully missing in most cinema presentations today.",1485043200,3,759,4.706766917293233

8573000,5,B00BR1ZFC4,"Finally got around to watching a film I've been excited to see since I
discovered it's existence 2 months ago. ""THE GHASTLY LOVE OF JOHNNY X""
from director/writer, Paul Bunnell and starring Will Keenan, Creed
Bratton, Reggie Bannister & the late, Kevin McCarthy. I loved it.

It's a retro 50's period piece involving a gang of greasers from outer
space called, The Ghastly Ones, ""serving time"" on Earth for their
intergalactic shenanigans. A post-dead rock star, a straight edge hero,
a slime ball concert promoter, manipulative heroines, and a Tor
Johnson-esq thug....all brought together with fantastic musical numbers
and perfect locations/sets....it's a pure, fun popcorn flick great for
all ages and highly recommend checking this gem out!",1443744000,,744,5.358974358974359
