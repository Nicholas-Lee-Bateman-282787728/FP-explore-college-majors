3719580,5,B001NLJ3R6,"OK, the DVD hasn't come out yet, but the show has been on PBS for the last season, and my 4 year old LOVES it.  This show does a great job of explaining things in a fun (and parents, a non-annoying!) way.  My son knows all about germs and decay and all kinds of fun things that don't come up in daily conversation.  Terrific job of making an educational show that is completely fun, too.",1233792000,11,387,4.133333333333334

3719585,5,B001NLJ3R6,Sid the Science Kid has great lessons for kids to learn.  They are fun to watch and the kids are learning even though they don't know realize it at the time.  Great learning tool!,1391299200,,179,4.235294117647059
3719586,5,B001NLJ3R6,My son is a huge Sid the Science Kid fan.  He LOVES this Sid DVD.  Is was worth the purchase.,1389916800,,93,3.6
3719587,5,B001NLJ3R6,"If you have a young child, then Sid the Science Kid is just right for you.  So far any DVD I have purchased has been quality viewing and well worth the money.  Sid proves that many science concepts are accessible to young kids when presented in the right way.  Science is all around these little guys, and they want to know.

This DVD contains four episodes:  My mushy banana, My Shrinking Shoes, My Ice Pops, and The Perfect Pancake.  Yes, my child learns, but the best thing is the sound of my kid's laughter as he watches.",1381276800,,525,4.360824742268041
3719588,5,B001NLJ3R6,I ordered this DVD for my three year old grandchild.  She loves watching it over and over.  Grandma enjoys it too and even learned a few new things.  Great product for children and adults alike and great price.,1379808000,,210,4.473684210526316
3719589,5,B001NLJ3R6,"My grandson loves these videos (he's 4 years old) and since it's educational, I thought he would also learn from them.  I even watched them!  Fascinating!",1377561600,,154,4.884615384615385
3719590,5,B001NLJ3R6,When faced with a 3 hour car ride with a 17 month old we decided Sid would be great to help entertain our son.  Love that it's a fun show and it teaches kids something. Really glad we bought it.,1372896000,,194,3.85
3719591,4,B001NLJ3R6,"Thanks a lot to give me the chance to add my comments, DVD very helpful to my kids but the copies isn't clear enough.",1364169600,,117,3.9166666666666665
3719592,5,B001NLJ3R6,"My 4 year old daughter loves watching Sid, and I don't really mind either! This is a great show thanks to the different subject matter than other kids shows. You don't find many that have to do with Science and this show is educational AND fun to watch. That makes a great show for my 4 year old and I don't feel guilty for letting her watch TV when she watches educational shows like this one. This is my 2nd Sid DVD I have bought from Amazon.com and this one was just as expected: new in packaging and my daughter loved watched the whole DVD in one sitting.

My only complaint, and it's a little one at that, is that it took a while to get delivered to me. This was probably my fault for choosing the free Super Saver shipping though. Every time I opt for the free shipping option the packages take a while and seem to go out of the way before they get to me. I guess that's what I get for picking the free option.",1363132800,,916,4.088888888888889
3719593,5,B001NLJ3R6,"Our 4-year old grandson loves the ""Sid"" series of vidoes. It combines a teaching topic with an enjoyable combination of animation, music, and dancing.",1360713600,,150,5.291666666666667

3719595,5,B001NLJ3R6,My son loves to learn and these videos puts things in to a way he understands.  He will watch some so much he can say the dialog as it's going on.,1358467200,,146,3.7096774193548385
3719596,5,B001NLJ3R6,"Excellent for little children and entertaining enough for older children as well. The science is simple but for a three year old it was informative. I'd recommend these for preschool to kindergarten age children. Even toddlers would enjoy them, however, as they capture a child's interest even if they're not old enough to understand the ""science"".",1358035200,,348,5.232142857142857
3719597,5,B001NLJ3R6,so very interesting.  my almost three year old and i are conducting an experiment becasue of the stimulation he received from the video.  these are great videos,1356480000,,160,4.888888888888889
3719598,5,B001NLJ3R6,Sid the Science Kid is one of the very best educational DVDs for small kids. They learn a lot and very quickly.,1297382400,,111,4.090909090909091
3719599,5,B001NLJ3R6,"My kids are a little older than the target audience, but they love the science in this show. They accurately and enthusiastically identify 'decay' on food or outside (fall leaves, pumpkins after halloween, etc). My six year old also keeps an observation journal, inspired by the show. The family and preschool depicted are loving and sweet. My only complaint is the actors--the voices are so-so compared to other Jim Henson programs. The little girl May is especially annoying, the actress sounds condescending and idiotic instead of innocent. We still buy and watch the videos, and the kids don't seem to mind May's voice.",1295049600,,623,5.058252427184466
3719600,5,B001NLJ3R6,"I have no idea what the reviewer who gave this show 1 star was thinking. It is educational, entertaining, holds my 20 month old's attention for the whole length of the DVD (on the 1 or 2 occasions she has actually been allowed to watch the whole thing at once), and best of all NOT AT ALL ANNOYING FOR ME TO SIT THROUGH! Sid is entertaining even for me. A welcome change from the painfully annoying shows like Yo Gabba Gabba (which she loves... yay...) or Barney that kids are so drawn to, and yet it holds their attention just as well and teaches them so much. I will admit that the characters look a little strange but that is part of what makes the show so unique. After finding out that Sid is 1/2 African American and 1/2 Jewish (his family celebrates Hanukkah, Kwanzaa, and Christmas), my husband and I had quite a bit of fun trying to decide what the ethnic backgrounds of the others were and realized that, if you think about it, the show is very diverse as far as the potential for introducing children to components that make up other cultures... Chinese culture (May), Hispanic culture (Gabriella)... we're not sure about Gerald though... maybe Irish? I hope that the Jim Henson company does not overlook this educational opportunity.

The only complaint I have is that there are 5 episodes following the ""Change Happens"" theme but only 4 were included on the DVD. The way Sid is set up, there are 4 episodes introducing new concepts relating to the theme (in this case decay, growth, reversible change, and irreversible change) and then a fifth episode reviewing the content discussed in the previous 4 episodes. It would have been nice to have this review episode included on the DVD.

Even with only 4 episodes of the 5 I give this DVD 5 stars and we will definitely be buying more Sid DVD's in the future. I am already choosing which ones to buy for my daughter's upcoming birthday!",1293494400,6,1897,4.560117302052786
3719601,1,B001NLJ3R6,"Not a fan of this, even though there are a lot of people out there who are. I just don't get it. Pretty much everything JHC has done has been brilliant... until this.

One of the things I dislike about this show is how Sid talks like someone with a developmental disorder. I know there will be overly sensitive people out there who will call me ""rude"", ""insensitive"", whatever, but that's really what it sounds like to me, folks. I really put my foot down when my toddler, who had a very well developed verbal skills, started talking like Sid, with the stutters and inflections, and all - just like Sid. Made me cringe. So, yes, IMO the vocal talent is terrible.

The animation is probably the worst part of the show, however (once again, IMO). Remember when JHC pioneered in puppetry? Long before the days of incessant CGI, we had one lonely crusader in Hollywood who kept the torch lit brightly on how to make live-action characters, instead of falling back on cheap computer graphics. I was floored when I realized this was JHC. Without knowing what's going on, it seems to me the current owners of JHC are merely cashing in on the companies name while putting out sub-par product that pales in comparison to the creative genius it used to be.

Once again, that's just MY opinion folks. Don't get all bent out of shape over it! I know there are many rabid die-hard Sid fans out there who can't help picking fights with people who have anything bad to say about this show. But you need to get over it. Maybe you should all watch the episode about respecting other people's opinions, eh?",1286928000,6,1588,4.526132404181185
3719602,5,B001NLJ3R6,"I bought this as a gift for a little cousin.  I like the idea of the subjects that Sid, the Science Kid discusses for the little children.  The music is good as well.",1285977600,,166,4.0
3719603,5,B001NLJ3R6,"My 2-year-old is allowed one TV program a day and Sid has been all she ever wanted to watch since we first discovered it on PBS last year. Aside from being fun an educational, the show is also clever and funny in ways that parents can appreciate, so it won't drive you as nuts as some other kid shows might if you had to watch them over and over again. It's by the Jim Henson company and some of that quirky Muppet Show-type humor comes through. Sid is such a favorite in our household that I also bought the music CD and we listen to it on long car trips. My daughter sings along happily until she falls asleep on long drives. A godsend!",1280966400,,638,4.153225806451613
3719604,5,B001NLJ3R6,"We currently own this DVD, as well as The Bug Club, Inside and Out, and The Ruler of Thumb. They are all fantastic. My son became a big fan of Sid after watching PBS in the morning, but started sleeping in later and missing it, so I bought the DVDs. They were well worth the money and have been watched over and over again. My son really began to enjoy this show when he was around 9 months old, and at 15 months he still loves it and I have a feeling we'll be watching them and buying the new DVDs as they come out for a long time. It's a great show for your child to grow with and is very cute and educational (I've learned a few things myself), and we find ourselves watching them even when he's not! My son loves music, and he really loves the songs in this show. I like the fact that most of the songs repeat in every episode so that he has learned to recognize them and I'm sure he will quickly learn the words when he gets older. Definitely, definitely recommend this television series to kids as young as 6 months and all the way up to preschool and kindergarten.",1278892800,,1071,4.104761904761904

3719606,5,B001NLJ3R6,"My son really likes the ""Sid the Science Kid"" series on PBS, and these DVDs appear to be those PBS shows on DVD.  So far i have 3 of the DVDs and have pre-ordered ""Weather Kid Sid"" due out in the summer.",1263513600,,203,3.8333333333333335

My family couldn't survive without SID.

Thanks SID",1256688000,,225,4.068181818181818
3719608,5,B001NLJ3R6,"Love the Sid the Science Kid series, totally exceeds expectations, makes science fun for me and my daughter!",1255910400,,108,5.055555555555555
3719609,5,B001NLJ3R6,"I tell you the more I am getting to know ""Sid"" the more that this little guy is growing on me.

I love the characters, I love the concept and I love the fact that Sid and his friends clearly and easily explain the scientific dynamics on how things change.

I am sure if you are a parent you have heard the ""How does..."" and ""Why does..."" questions a million times. With my twins I get questions thrown at me at a double rate.

Sid the Science Kid is a perfect video for little ones and entertaining enough to keep grown ups listening as well.

With 115 minutes of video and four episodes: My Mushy Banana, My Shrinking Shoes, My Ice Pops and The Perfect Pancake...you not only receive entertainment but a wonderful start on teaching your children to love science.

I hated the annual science fair at school during my elementary years but if there were cartoons like ""Sid the Science Kid - Change Happens"" there may have been a lot of change in my views of science. I must be honest and say that I wasn't really sure what makes a Banana turn brown until I saw this video. I know sad, huh? But hey, now I know and so do the twins! Seems like Sid is doing his job!

3719610,5,B001NLJ3R6,"[...] This DVD contains the episode:  My mushy banana, My Shrinking Shoes, My Ice Pops, and The Perfect Pancake.

Sid the Science Kid wants to know why things have to change.  Why does his yellow banana turn brown?  How come his shoes are shrinking?  What made his ice pop melt and just how does Grandma know how to make a pancake this is not too squishy or burnt?  Sid and his friends work together to discover the efects of time, temperature and the environment with the help of some revealing experiments and songs.

My three year old boy and 5 year old girl love Sid, and prefer this collection ""Change Happens"" over the other just released collection The Bug Club.  The rotten banana episode is a particular favorite, with the kids talking about ""decay"" the whole day long.  This DVD is almost two hours long (115 minutes) but if you act now you will get a bonus DVD disk containing an additional 2 hours of content (134 minutes).

Early purchasers will also an additional DVD called Front Row Fun starring an additional episode of Sid (on our disk we got the episode Why do we need Charts) as well as episodes of WorldWorld, Dive Olly Dive!, Hermie and Friends, Pocoyo and Hopla.  This is a real bargain for the price.  A super show produced by Jim Henson's studio and directed by his son Brian Henson.  Highly recommended.",1247961600,31,1329,4.556962025316456

8327324,3,B001NLJ3R6,"Bought this series to begin introducing my son to the idea of science before Kindergarten and I'm a little dissappointed.  The theory is good with each episode being based on one idea but the content comes off bland in the preschool setting and never actually gets in depth on anything.  I know the kids enjoy the songs and dancing but between the song on the way there, rug time song and others they waste a lot of the episode on things that have nothing to do with the topic being discussed.  Basically I just think this series is so so.  I really wanted to love it because of the educational aspect but its just not great.  We will be moving on to magic school bus soon and these videos will go away.",1453852800,,703,4.295454545454546
