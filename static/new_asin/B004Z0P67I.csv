AVOID the butchered CRITERION COLLECTION's version - unless of course you like to be short changed.",1408233600,,185,4.8125
8492133,5,B004Z0P67I,Make sure you buy the Original 2.9h SWEDISH Version which is only available as a  DVD for Region 2 Pal version. AVOID the inferior 1.25h butchered US version sold by the Criterion Collection ( most people confuse the two versions and their reviews posted here mainly relate to the US version) - hope this helps !,1408060800,,312,4.571428571428571
