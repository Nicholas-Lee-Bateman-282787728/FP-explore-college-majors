2593490,5,B000FZETY8,"This DVD is incredible!  Its fun, exciting, and best of all it puts you, as the viewer, in control.  I had very high expectations because I grew up reading the Choose Your Own Adventure books.  I was not disappointed.  The DVD operates the same way that the books used to, except now you use the DVD remote control to choose what happens next.

You can literally choose and control the story line.  There are over ten stories, and the movie has some big stars in it, like William H. Macy (he was in Seabiscuit and Fargo) and Frankie Muniz, who plays Malcolm from Malcolm in the Middle.

I showed it to my two kids (aged 4 and 7) and they couldn't stop watching it.  They kept going back and making different choices and watching the different outcomes.  This has got to be the coolest thing I've seen in a while, and the best use of DVD technology I can think of.

My only criticism is that they theme song is so catchy that its annoying, you can't get it out of your head.

Great for kids and great for parents, especially parents that used to read the books.",1150934400,5,1060,4.303030303030303
2593571,5,B000FZETY8,Bought the DVD as a gift for my relatives because of my own past experience with the Choose Your Own Adventure Books growing up.  Their kids love the product and continually watch the DVD to see how the various endings play out--they're entertained for hours.  I'm surprised there aren't more of them available... 2 enthusiastic thumbs up!,1156377600,,339,4.9298245614035086
2593572,5,B000FZETY8,"I'm not sure if all every kid will like the DVD but my niece (6) hasn't stopped talking about it.  My niece is a hands on, smart girl.  Because, the DVD requires interaction, I'm not sure if she would like it if she were a more passive personality.  But, she's really into learning/school/etc and likes the DVD so I thought that I would report back.",1154995200,,349,4.338461538461538
2593573,5,B000FZETY8,"As the first interactive children's DVD, Choose Your Own Adventure provides a completely unique twist on the traditional movie experience.  My take on why this is a great video for kids is that it teaches critical decision-making skills.  With the ability to choose what happens at different points during the film, kids are actively engaged in the storyline. Kids must focus their full attention and test their ability to make wise decisions.

For years, kids have enjoyed the interactive Choose Your Own Adventure novels, and just as in the book series, kids have to decide at many critical junctures what happens next. Throughout the journey, accidents occur which delay their trip and decisions made dramatically change the plot outcome of the story.  Should the children parachute out of an airplane? Trust a suspicious stranger? Cross a rickety bridge? With over 20 possible plot lines, they must keep trying to make the best choices, which will ultimately lead them to the ""real"" (i.e. the satisfying) ending where the next adventure in this series, to Paris, is foreshadowed. Recently hailed in the Wall Street Journal for its unique educational and entertaining base, the new Choose Your Own Adventure DVD is a must-have for all kids!

2593574,5,B000FZETY8,"I didn't read these books when I was younger, but a good friend recommended the DVD.  My nieces loved it! They were so excited that they could actually make the decisions for the characters! They spent the entire time absorbed, laughing over the outcomes and wondering what the alternative options would produce.  This DVD naturally lends itself to multiple viewings, and the storylines are clever and fun.  Great product!",1153872000,8,422,5.086956521739131
2593575,5,B000FZETY8,"I absolutely loved these books when I was a child, and I just watched the DVD with my nephews who were completely absorbed by the interactive adventure. It's a lot of fun to be able to share a memory from my own childhood with my nephews and watch them become as engaged with the choices and outcomes as I used to be.  What a great (and long overdue) idea!  By design, these DVDs keep children involved for multiple viewings while the additional features provided are also educational.  The fact that the makers were able to get William H. Macy and Frankie Muniz to voice the roles is just icing on the cake.  On the whole, a fantastic product.  Can't wait for the next one to come out!",1153872000,9,686,4.3700787401574805
2593576,5,B000FZETY8,"I grew up reading all the ""Choose Your Own Adventure"" books - at least the first 30 in the series. I loved these as a child and when I saw they were coming out with a DVD, I had to get it (for my son, not for me...well, for me too).

My son loves watching this over and over trying out different paths and even replaying his favorite ""stories"". As a parent, I like the educational aspect and overall positive tone of the material.

The voices are from top Hollywood stars and the animation is high quality (not like some of those mass produced Saturday morning cartoons).

On a side note, we also bought the newly re-printed book version of The Abominable Snowman and my son is now getting hooked on the series. Anything that motivates my son to read more gets 5 stars in my book.",1153872000,8,780,4.292517006802721
2593577,5,B000FZETY8,This DVD is phenomenal.  My daughter can't get enough of it.  I am always concerned with DVD's for children.  I don't like the idea of plopping my child in front of the television for hours of animation.  But this is a great DVD for us to watch together.  It is interactive (she LOVES to choose the storyline) and it is informative.  A great buy for our family!  Can't wait for the next one.,1153353600,5,391,4.273972602739726
2593578,5,B000FZETY8,Our family has watched this DVD several times over and each time there is always a surprise.  We take turns choosing which path to explore and we usually watch it a few times over.  It is a great way to relax with the family and it really keeps them engaged and entertained.,1152748800,6,274,4.25
2593579,5,B000FZETY8,"I got 2 copies of the movie back in February and my kids just loved it. It's interactive like a video game and encourages you kids to enjoy the Choose Your Own Adventure Series. There were 184 CYOA book released e mail me for a list. Edward Packard started it all with *Sugarcane Island (The Adventure of You Series) published in 1976 by Vermont Crossroads Press. Sundance Publishing also offers a complete educational series that goes along with the DVDs, Computer Program that teaches you to write, books, and Website. As a homeschooler of 1 child and 3 that go to public schools this is a great teaching program. I hope you have as much enjoyment from this as I have.

Have a blessed day,

Testimonials:

""I love this program. It's smart and really reinforces good decision making. And, it's definitely worthy of repeat viewing since the outcome changes every time you change your options.""

- Ranny Levy - Founder and President, Coalition for Quality Children's Media

""Extraordinary! Clever! Imaginative! The Abominable Snowman multifaceted interactive adventure gives you the opportunity to choose your direction on a journey into an exotic world of mystical characters and fabled creatures that will thrill all the family.""

- Janet Stokes, Executive Director, Film Advisory Board

""The boys absolutely loved it! They are at a grade 4 and 5 level and were able to make their way through the menu with no difficulty. It was interesting to watch how they decided to rotate the converter so they each had an opportunity to select a choice of their own. I sat back and watched as the boys figured things out for themselves in an uncharacteristically co-operative manner.""
-Carol Roy, Teacher, Mississauga, Ontario.

""I really enjoyed the 'CHOOSE YOUR OWN ADVENTURE' movie, it was great! The best part was the airplane ride because it made Mrs. Roy seasick. Will you be making more CHOOSE YOUR OWN ADVENTURE's? Thanks for letting us watch it.""
-Bernardo and Matthew, Carol Roy's students, Mississauga, Ontario

""The DVD is absolutely amazing. I felt like a little kid again when I was watching it. I'd read the Abominable Snowman story when I was younger and this brought it all back. I played it for my roommates too and they all had their memories jogged as well. I'm sure kids will go ecstatic for it when it comes out.""
- Matt Berical, Ithaca, NY, writer for CORNELL MAGAZINE

""This DVD has everything. It is extremely creative. It opens up young minds to the wonders of the world, to thought provoking decision making, and consequences of action. As a teacher and a parent I see the children understanding characterization, the courses of a plot and the geographical material that brings young children into a global education. It is the start of a super series.""

I've watched it so many times, but I still like to watch it over and over again. Some movies are just one story line, but this movie gives you choices. The only negative is that I wish there even more choices for story lines just like the original books.""",1329523200,,385,4.078947368421052

8127833,4,B000FZETY8,"It was very cute and the grandchildren I gave it to were very ""into it "".

Anything that gets them more involved with reading and stories is great. They are all 5 years old and it's the perfect time to really intensify the reading the family has incorporated into their lives since they were babies.

I also loved the little ""making good choices"" lessons it taught subliminally through the children's choices made during the story.",1168819200,,431,4.733333333333333
