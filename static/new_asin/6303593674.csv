698214,5,6303593674,This movie is really a masterpiece.? What a Shame it has never been publisshed in DVD. The quality of the available edition is extremely poor,1029456000,20,141,4.68
698215,4,6303593674,"""Sundays and Cybele"" is a beautiful film, sensitively handling the delicate subject of an adult male's love for a young girl. Unfortunately, it's another case of less than pristine elements being used to make a video transfer.  As previous reviewers have noted, the widescreen print that's been transfered to video is quite poor, with dull contrast, heavy scratches, and extremely difficult to read subtitles.  Amazingly, there is a better transfer available, a fine contrast print with deep grey tones and few scratches, and -get this- new, yellow subtitles!  Unfortunately, it's a pan-and-scan version where you end up losing nearly half of the available image, but at least you can read the subtitles with ease.  This version has turned up on cable tv over the last few years, but was never on video, as far as I can tell.  Why a letterboxed video version hasn't been put together with the same or similar elements, I don't know.  Until that happens though, we'll have to make do with what we have.  It's a shame this is the case, because ""Sundays and Cybele"" deserves better.",1005955200,42,1079,4.895604395604396

Recently, I found it by my country websites that related movies. I'm so surprised. 'cuz ..I thought that mostly people in my country(I'm a korean) didn't watch. but A few remember it.

To any but anyone with sufficient perspicacity to accept the quaintnesses of black&white and a superb directorial style.  Anyone else, including myself, who has no problem accepting the easy transition between ""now"" (a word, like ""reality,"" which makes sense only between inverted commas) and ""then"" and has some understanding of the extent to which international film has severely ossified since ""then,"" must embrace Bourguignon's film with open arms.

698399,3,6303593674,"This is a hard movie to write a review about.  It is the story of a thirty something man and a young girl.  The man suffered distress while at war that leaves him like a child.  The girl has been abandoned by her family and is distressed as well.  The male is living with a nurse who treated him in the hospital.  The nurse loves this man.  He is unable to really respond to her love.  The man and the girl hit it off right away- in a non- sexual way.  Well, sort of.  The girl fantisizes verbally about marrying the man when she turns 18.  What the movie never explains is why the nurse and the man are never alone together except at night after she is off work.  It seems that she would have at least one day a week off to be with the man she loves.  I have given away as much of the plot as I care to give away.  I am aware the most of the reviewers on Amazon and in the general public give this film a much higher rateing than I give it-and it won the 1962 Oscar for best Foreign Film.

The image quality has greatly improved over past versions, and the subtitles are easier to read.  However, to my eyes the ultimate has yet to be realized, for some blurs and other debris are noted along the way, particularly in the background.  I'd say this renders about 95% of what we saw originally on the big screen--still a big improvement from past VHS and DVD editions.

698404,5,6303593674,"A beautiful film, in terms of both images and story. This very sweet - but never sticky -and slightly disturbing story of a platonic 'love affair' between a psychologically damaged, almost child-like ex-soldier and an emotionally abandoned 12 year old girl is deeply moving, honest, and just creepy enough in terms of in nascent sexuality hovering around the edges of the relationship to keep us from feeling too at ease. Shot in gorgeous black and white, with great use of shadows and silhouette, the images are both beautiful and mysterious -- as is the film's central relationship.

Hardy Kruger is excellent as the amnesiac soldier who has the feeling he's done something awful, but doesn't know what, or how to atone for it (we know more, having seen a dream- like flashback of his war experiences to open the film). He is lovable and sad, but we sense there's always a danger this man could lose control and cause damage without meaning to. And Patricia Gozzi is remarkable as the young girl, bringing an almost frightening amount of pain to this hurt character, and never feeling like a kid faking it for a film. There's a complex honesty to her performance combining hurt, innocent joy, emotional need, the first flickers of adult sensuality and manipulativeness, and yet a child's open heart that any seasoned actor would envy.

The film does telegraph where its headed more than once, but somehow it doesn't matter very much. It's the humanity of the telling rather than any surprise twist that makes the film work so well. We root for this odd pair to be able to maintain their bond in the face of a grown up world that doesn't understand how much these two damaged souls need each other and is, as one character puts it, afraid of any love that doesn't fit into nice neat categories. Beautifully made and haunting, it won the Oscar for best foreign film in 1963.",1415923200,2,1874,4.72782874617737

The fact that it opened up this kind of relationship, it did a service to humanity.  I loved it, but could see where people expecting grand movement in a movie might be disappointed.  I found ""grand movement"" in the emotional relationship between the two characters.  For me it was a chance to share the emotions of what that kind of relationship could be.  The simple beauty of the love between the girl and Hardy was so special.  The ending blew me ""out of the water"" when I saw it the first time.

""Sundays and C y b e l e"" is this kind of film, initially released in 1962, garnering an Academy Award for Best Freign Film the following year. And for good reason: it is an absorbing, engrossing story about the innocence of childhood pitted against the suspicions and relative cynicism of the adult world that witnesses it and ultimately passes judgment on it, leading to its haunting, tragic finale. What I've always liked about this exceptional film is how this very emotional story unfolds, along with the cutting edge camerawork of the day. The plot unfolds beautifully and with sensitivity. Two damaged souls meet and forge a primal connection to each other, one a lost soul of an amnesiac and the other a young child abandoned by her father at a convent school in France.

698565,5,6303593674,"Postponing a discussion of the direction, acting, and cinematography, I will begin by noting that this film deserves high praise first for its forthright raising questions about human relationships that most of us prefer to suppress, ignore, or simply answer with unthinking righteousness. I don't believe such a movie could be made, or at least distributed, in our present-day world, that takes pride in its tolerance and celebration of diversity while thoughtlessly condemning certain kinds of relationships as depraved. Among more recent films, only ""Doubt"", perhaps, dares to broach some of the themes addressed, and addressed with sensitivity, charm, and boldness, in ""Dimanches"", but the former does so gingerly, glancing off from its target lest the viewer become too uncomfortable when confronted with the requirement to ponder--rather than judge--human needs we prefer not to confront. ""Dimanches"" does not flinch.

If ""Dimanches"" is unknown to you, you will want to be told that it is a tale of a close relationship between a man of thirty, a man with serious emotional impairment, and a girl of twelve, an abandoned, lonely girl possessing nothing but a vivid imagination to sustain her. One flash of genius is setting the action in Avray, best known for a benign and soothing Corot painting of its pond; the pond figures prominently and ironically in the film. Another is the progression, also ironic, of the action to its climax at midnight on Christmas Eve. Don't expect joy, brotherhood, and goodwill to emanate; this is not a ""feel-good"" movie, to put it mildly. A third is the somber musical accompaniment, including the inspired selection of the ""Miserere nobis"" from Charpentier's ""Messe de Minuit pour Nol"". (""Dimanches"" received only a nomination for best score in the 1962 Oscars; it did, however, win in the ""best foreign film"" category.)

In a new century when dazzling technical virtuosity dominates the art of cinematography, the simpler modes of expression of a movie now half a century old may require adjusting one's expectations. Most appropriately filmed in black and white, some of the novelties in ""Dimanches"" may seem old-hat to young viewers. This DVD rendering could certainly have been better, but it is, I believe, the only one available with English subtitles.

Bourgignon's direction is faultless, but what will linger longest with a viewer is the superb acting of the principal roles, most especially Patricia Gozzi's challenging evocation of the aspirations and emotions of a distressed child about to become a woman. French film has given us a number of fine performances by child actors, but none that has surpassed Ms. Gozzi's in ""Dimanches"".

If you have never seen ""Dimanches"" and still need convincing, perhaps the excellent review in the New York Times will win you over. Just Google ""Bosley Crowther"" and ""Sundays and Cybele"" to read it.",1357948800,10,2887,5.202150537634409
698685,5,6303593674,"This splendid film has to be the best-kept secret of the last half century in the film industry.  After winning an Oscar in 1963 for the Best Foreign Language Film and two more Oscar nominations the following year (Best Music and Best Screenplay), and a win in the same category of the Blue Ribbon Awards in 1964, it practically sunk into oblivion, especially in its country of origin, France, illustrating once more that no man is a prophet in his own land.  Soon after, Columbia Pictures, which owns the rights for this film, refused to release it because of its controversial subject.  Fortunately, Columbia has now relented and recently authorized its release on DVD, in Italy, Germany, and England.

The film's subject was risqu fifty years ago, and it remains so even now, and maybe even more so.  How can one make us believe in the delicate charm of this wondrous love story between a shell-shocked, amnesiac, thirty-something man and a lonely twelve-year-old child without promoting or raising the specter of pedophilia? In reading this film's synopsis, one immediately thinks of ""Lolita,"" except for the fact that in ""Sundays and Cybele"" the adult man is not the sexually obsessed Humbert Humbert and the young girl is not the treacherous nymphet, Dolores Haze. Under Director Serge Bourguignon, ""Sundays and Cybele"" becomes an authentic masterpiece, deeply moving, a film touched by grace and poetry, which is made even more miraculous by its controversial subject.

The story is that of Pierre (Hardy Krger), a pilot who, while crash-landing his plane during a mission in Vietnam (during the Franco-Vietnamese War) had perhaps killed a young girl. He now lives in Ville d'Avray with Madeleine (Nicole Courcel), the nurse who restored him to physical health. Although amnesiac, he is traumatized by a sense of culpability that he cannot comprehend. Pierre spends his days waiting for the recovery of his memory, and for getting over his acrophobia.

At the local train station, he by chance meets a twelve-year-old girl, Franoise/Cyble (Patricia Gozzi). The girl is accompanied by her father who is planning to abandon her to the care of a Catholic boarding school in town (the girl's mother previously ran away with a magician).  Pierre is shattered by the young girl's tears and he desperately attempts to see her again at the boarding school.  Eventually, he successfully presents himself to the sisters as the girl's father and he is thus allowed to take her out on Sundays.  Between these two damaged characters, a deep history of friendship is born...and so is an intense love story of incredible purity, a love that the cynical and practical adult world cannot understand and will eventually condemn.

On these blessed days, Pierre and Cyble (her real name) walk in the town's forest and around its magical ponds, losing themselves in nature vaulted cathedral of trees which surround them.  They live outside society, in their own world which they enter through their magic ritual, which consists in throwing a stone in one of the ponds, producing surface waves which open the door of their secret universe.

""Les Dimanches de Ville d'Avray,"" as the film is known in France, is based on the eponymous novel by Bernard Echassriaux.  This was Serge Bourguignon's feature film debut (and what a debut!) and it became his magnum opus.  The scenario is by Serge Bourguignon and Antoine Tudal, and so are the dialogues by Bourguignon, in collaboration with Echassriaux.  Besides the grace of the cinematic conceit and the dialogue, Bourguignon's mise-en-scene is praiseworthy from beginning to end: instead of physically and literally recreating an imaginary world, he suggests its reality through its magic.  For example, there is a traveling framing of Pierre's and Cyble's reflections in the water rather than on them directly, as well as the many contemplative shots of nature during which the dialogue is superimposed.  The camera behaves as another character, a silent witness intimidated by their love, who does not dare to look them directly in the eyes, lest their innocence be corrupted. With these simple effects, Bourguignon renders the beauty and purity of their union - and also its fragility. The film puts great emphasis on intimate, silent scenes, such as the walks along the pounds and in the forest, in the cold and the mist of the winter Sundays, or between Pierre and Madeleine in their home.  Although this film was made during the birth of the Nouvelle Vague, Bourguignon's film is closer to the poetic realism of Carn, Renoir, and in particular the tone in Ren Clment's Forbidden Games (1952).

The relatively small cast is brilliant, starting with Patricia Gozzi's extraordinary portrayal of Cyble as an extremely feminine, intelligent, and enchanting little girl.  She plays this character with astounding insight, evoking the apparent understanding of a mature woman.  Her attachment to Pierre is a mixture of her budding sexual stirrings and of the impulses to reach for the male affection she has never known in a loveless, broken home.  Gozzi is without a doubt the finest child actress I have ever seen. This remarkable actress acted in only seven films over the course of eleven years, from 1960 to 1970, after which she unfortunately left the cinema.  Hardy Krger fulfils his difficult role of Pierre with panache, as a misfit on the margins of society. He portrays a man whose life has been shattered, and who is desperately trying to find a way out of his amnesia and vertigo, to start anew.  Early in their friendship, Pierre says to Cyble, ""You will be my healer."" And in the process of his healing, Pierre becomes as much of a father to Cyble as he is her big brother, her boyfriend, and even her son.

Nicole Courcel has had a long and successful career in films, theater, and television. In this film, she underscores her well-deserved reputation in the role of a loving and understanding mistress who has brought Pierre to physical health and is patiently trying to restore his mental health through her unconditional love. Daniel Ivernel is also excellent in his role as Pierre's best (and only) friend and confident, a man who has tried to understand and accepted his friend's relationship with the young girl.

The setting is Ville d'Avray, a small community near Paris which at the time of the filming had still retained its rustic setting, its forest with its hunting roads and famous pounds which so inspired the painter Jean Batiste Corot. The sublime photography in black and white is by Henri Deca, who has 84 films on his rsum, including such memorable films as Louis Malle's ""The Lovers"" (1958) and Franois Truffaut's ""The 400 Blows"" (1959).  Maurice Jarre's discreet and beautiful musical score, together with a very appropriate old French song (""Aux marches du palais""), and other musical excerpts ranging from Tibetan music to works by classical composers including Thomaso Albinoni and Marc-Antoine Charpentier, and exquisite natural sounds, creates an other-worldly, timeless atmosphere.

 As mentioned above, the film's subject, the relationship between an adult man and a young girl, might be extremely controversial.  Although no sexual relation is ever suggested between Pierre and Cyble, their relationship being primarily emotional in nature (in Greek mythology, the goddess Earth Mother Cybele had a eunuch mendicant priesthood).  Nevertheless, many viewers and critics were none the less shocked and outraged. Times have not much changed: at a recent screening of the film at a cin-club a few years ago, many viewers were appalled that such a ""eulogy to pedophilia"" could be shown. The strength of Bourguignon's film is the subtlety and sensitivity with which the subject is handled.  He never looks for the shocking or the melodramatic, or poses himself as a moralist. He is simply an emotional witness to the story where a child who has grown perhaps too fast and an adult who has reverted to childhood meet and emerge from their individual loneliness.  Bourguignon distances himself from the melodramatic by adopting an outsider's point of view:  his genius has been to put the viewer in the position of Madeleine and Carlos, rather than that of Pierre and Cyble.  Choosing the latter for the viewpoint would certainly have been detrimental to the film, manipulating the viewer's emotions to the extreme.  Following Bourguignon's suggestion, we should become a Madeleine or a Carlos, merely observing, and through our observations, try to understand

There is no doubt that ""Sundays and Cybele"" is a true French cinema masterpiece, and it would be quasi-criminal to still ignore it.  Fortunately, there are no more excuses, thanks to the film now being available on DVD.",1332115200,35,8749,5.0831005586592175
698686,5,6303593674,"I hadn't seen this award-winning film in decades, and wondered if it would be as good my teenaged memories of it -- but my fears were groundless. While nostalgia certainly colored my viewing, I found it just as moving as I had so many years ago, when I was far less experienced & at an emotionally uncertain age -- not entirely unlike its two protagonists.

This sort of story isn't in vogue today. No doubt most filmmakers would be reluctant to touch such a gentle, bittersweet story, since it deals with the relationship between a lonely 12-year old girl & a psychologically wounded 30-year old pilot. I'm afraid the sexually over-saturated atmosphere of contemporary culture would make the story just a little suspect, casting it in predatory terms.

That's a shame, because we're in somewhat symbolic territory here, a landscape of the psyche as opposed to the ""real"" world. In fact, trying to judge this as a completely ""realistic"" film just doesn't work. It's true that some of the supporting characters are hard to accept as people you or I might know. But they aren't supposed to be, because this is a story of innocence -- its power, its fragility, and how a supposedly more ""sensible"" world distrusts it, distorts it, and ultimately destroys it.

Hardy Kruger is very good as the shattered pilot, but young Patricia Gozzi is even better as the emotionally abandoned little girl. What an expressive face she has! Their relationship is tender, mutually supportive ... yet the director is honest enough to acknowledge a certain erotic undercurrent, where the purity of their love is tinged by something slightly more -- something unspoken, never to be acted upon, but still very real. Again, this would never be acceptable today.

Each of the two protagonists is searching for a lost Eden, a redemption that exists in the private bubble of their relationship, a projected ideal each sees in the other ... but their idyll is finally ephemeral & doomed, just as we're all doomed to grow up. The ending is all too predictable & inevitable, of course. Could it really ever have ended any other way?

The only drawback is that the film is only available on VHS, in a so-so print. This is crying for restoration & DVD release, as it's too good to be forgotten. Heartbreakingly recommended!",1235433600,10,2290,4.831632653061225

698688,4,6303593674,"Somewhere along the way, I had gotten the impression that ""Sundays and Cybele"" was one of those great ""feel good"" movies.  The two or three different stills I had seen over the years showed me two people lovingly enjoying being with each other.  I knew from those same pictures that the movie focussed on a man and a young girl.  As the film began, I soon became aware that the two main characters had each been damaged through different means.  The relationship that grew between them was indeed, quite impressive and certainly worthy of this movie.  My challenge was to appreciate the impressive way that we were made to know the extent of the man's disability.  It became difficult to watch the man in his inability to comprehend and cope with his limitations.  However, I realized that the relationship that was portrayed in ""Sundays and Cybele"" was able to transcend the standard movie fare because of the man's severe dysfunction.

The VHS copy of this movie was rather dark which probably helped to enhance the film's impact.  There was enough light to obscure a number of the English subtitles.  I may have missed an important piece of dialogue here and there because I was unclear about the ending of the movie.  It may have been clear to others but my impression was that there were two possible explanations to the outcome of the movie; one innocent, one brutal.  I believe that the movie was as coarse as it was to keep us uncertain of the ending.  Many may likely chose the one that is more comforting while secretly worrying that it may actually have been the opposite.

698690,5,6303593674,"I saw a dubbed version of this beautiful and heart-rending film once on PBS (WTTW) in Chicago, in 1974 or 1975.  Would that it were still available, because it solved the problem of the unreadable subtitles.",1160784000,3,207,4.75
698691,4,6303593674,"I first saw this film at a small theatre in St. Louis, alas no longer in business. The images were such that they seemed engraved within my consciousness, at once soft and gentle but also harsh and powerful.

Sundays and Cybele details a kind of rare tenderness between an adult and a child, one that is in no way immoral or forbidden but is nonetheless foreign and even threatening to most adults, like some primitive urge that we repress without knowing why. I was reminded of some dialogue from The ""Little Prince"" by St. Exupery and the film captures a kind of timeless childlike quality, a feeling of mystery and magic shared by the character of the child, played by Patricia Gozzi as well as the adult, portrayed by Hardy Krueger, rendered to a child's level of insight by the tragedy surrounding a plane crash during the war.

There may be some elements of the film that are dated but they hardly represent major flaws and the film still has the ability to touch one deeply. I know of no other film quite like ""Sundays & Cyble"" and that in itself is rather sad.",1142985600,9,1068,4.5
698692,5,6303593674,"This is first and foremost an extremely beautiful film. The photography, the composition, the pearly grays, the delicate reflections, the enchanting smile of Patricia Gozzi, her tears, all account for an unforgettable cinematic experience. Very much in the aesthetics of the sixties, following Ingmar Bergman, that was the time of Fellini and Antonioni, the time of glorious B&W.

The story has become somewhat less convincing with the passing of the years, although it remains painful and nostalgic and sweet. It describes the adult-child love relationship of Cybele and Pierre. Here the adult is the child, Pierre (Hardy Kruger), a pilot who suffered war trauma, amnesia and emotional anesthesia, and the child is the adult, the abandoned twelve-year old girl Cybele (Patricia Gozzi), who has grown in the midst of suffering and loneliness, and who behaves as the mature one in this anomalous and defenceless couple.

The tragedy looms in the air from the beginning and closes inexorably on Pierre and Cybele. The beauty  of the scenery and the purity of their child love makes the tragedy more unfair and even more tragic. Their little secret refuge, the tiny microcosm the two lovers have built as a bubble to protect themselves from their inmense loneliness and their fear of the unbearable reality, is shattered like a crystal by the base suspicion of the ""grown up"" world. The end of the movie is almost unbearable in its suffering and its beauty. One cannot but compare with ""The Virgin Spring"" by Bergman.

It is unfortunate that neither Serge Bourguignon, the director and scriptwriter, nor Patricia Gozzi, were seen again in a film comparable in quality to this lovely 1962 best foreign movie of the year. I saw this movie first when I was a lonely and shy medical student, it never ever abandoned me afterwards, in all its nostalgic pain and tragic splendor.",1127779200,59,1870,5.02258064516129

7852351,5,6303593674,"Okay, not understanding why the Criterion BLU-RAY is nowhere to be found on Amazon - if one clicks the blu-ray icon at the top one is taken to a second-rate something that isn't the Criterion Blu-ray.  Maybe it is, but the cover certainly isn't - it's a foreign release.  So, let's talk about the Criterion Blu-ray, which at least a few of the ""reviews"" here do.  Let's get the obvious out of the way first: The film was a masterpiece back in 1962 when I first discovered it, and it's a masterpiece now and it will be a masterpiece twenty years from now.  The acting is superb, the direction is beautiful and nuanced, and the black-and-white scope photography is stunning.  To the guy who said you have to put expectations aside for the photography due to the brilliance of photography in today's films - are you mad?  I don't know of any film of recent vintage as beautifully photographed as Sundays and Cybele.  As to the ""relationship"" presented in the film - yes, it's complex, but please keep your 2018 BS far away from this film, check your 2018 perceptions at the door and if you can't stay far away from this stunning film and shame on you.  To the reviewer who said Ms. Gozzi only made two films - incorrect.  Besides this and Rapture (another lovely film, but nowhere near as lovely as this film), she made five other films, including two prior to this, one of which is Melville's wonderful Leon Morin, Priest.  Not hard to find this stuff out, you know.  This film is as fresh as the day it was made and don't let anyone tell you otherwise and certainly don't listen to anyone hear who says this transfer could be bettered because they simply have no idea what they're talking about.  All these decades later it remains, for me, one of the most sublime films ever made.",1519344000,,1780,4.4937888198757765
7852352,5,6303593674,"I saw this film in an art house cinema (read: limited distribution) in Philadelphia during the early-60s and was blown away by everything: the brilliant acting, the beautiful photography (by Henri Deca), the desolate landscape, the script ...can't think of a thing that I found wanting!  What a Masterpiece, no wonder it won an Oscar in 1962 for Best Foreign Film, and Hardy Kruger said that it was his favorite film (in which he starred).

Patricia Gozzi was an actress of immense talent.  Unfortunately, she went on to act in only one more film, RAPTURE (1965).  Both films should be on every film-lover's shelf!

Unfortunately, the writer and the director made a key error in the ending of the film when they left out the most important scene of all:  when the police confront the man and the girl, ultimately leading to the man's death.  All that is mentioned about what happened is when a policeman says they were lucky to get to the man when they did, because he had a knife.  But couldn't that have been the knife from before?  All we get to see is the man's girlfriend and her friend drive around in a car, arguing.  The ending (or lack of it) truly ruined an amazing story.  Really, really disappointing.",1448841600,,716,4.5390625
