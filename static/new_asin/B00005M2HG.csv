8571228,5,B00005M2HG,"From the back cover: ""Sebastian describes the last few days in the life of the Catholic martyr, St. Sebastian, depicting his relationship with the Emperor Diocletian in 303 A.D., and his banishment to a remote outpost of the Roman Empire because of his Christian sympathies. An ambiguous relationship between Sebastian and his Commanding Officer, Severus, develops at this isolated garrison, eventually ending with Sebastian's violent execution, slain by his fellow soldiers.""

The movie was directed by Derek Jarman and has a soundtrack by Brian Eno. The movie stars Neil Kennedy, Richard Warwick, and Lindsay Kemp. The cover's summary makes it sound like an educational film for catechism, but it is heavily homoerotic, bordering on soft-core pornography and includes some male frontal nudity. This film is a staple of gay film festivals and is interesting for its Latin script with English subtitles.",1182902400,2,903,5.404255319148936
