8416590,3,B004589C98,"This video looks like a low-res YouTube video and there is an persistent, annoying logo in the corner of the image. The performance is also lackluster by The Who's standards. A much better video of the same tour called ""Schlitz: The Who Rocks America"" is, sadly, out of print.

Why can't someone treat The Who with the respect they deserve and release remastered versions of their video live archival material?
