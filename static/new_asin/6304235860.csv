7865875,2,6304235860,This video doesn't give the burn for the abs and arms like other videos.  The instructor does more of a routine instead repeition of exercises therefore making it ineffective.  The only part that I got a good workout was the arm floor exercise even then you have to be careful not to drop the weights on your head (smiles).  I'm sure there are better abs and arms workout on the market.,1120608000,,386,4.408450704225352
7865876,2,6304235860,"I've seen alot better videos out there.  The moving the legs and arms were not effective exercises and the abs section is not challenging. I'd skip, this is the worse review I've ever done.",1060905600,2,189,4.5588235294117645

7865879,3,6304235860,"I have mixed feelings about this video.  First of all, I'm not crazy about the style of the ""Crunch"" series; the participants always seem a little TOO enthusiastic to me, to the point of coming off as very fake.  However, the instructor, Faith, seemed more genuinely motivating; she reminded me of Donna Richardson in exercise style and of Julianne Moore in appearance.  I also don't like the extended warm-ups (close to 10 minutes) in the Crunch tapes, as I usually warm up via other exercise before doing toning tapes.
The workout itself is divided into four sections, two for arms and two for abs.  Faith starts with standing arms work, and this is the section I liked the least.  The main thing I disliked was that while working the arms with light weights, you are also moving your legs--lunges, side steps, etc.  Fans of ""The Firm"" series may like this style, but I found that it unncessarily complicates the workout, especially since it isn't really adding much of a leg workout.  The arms exercises themselves aren't very challenging, but unforunately, they are done in such a way that it wouldn't be easy to use heavier weights.  The second section moves on to floor abs work.  In this section, the moves were less complex and better cued.  The third section returns to workout the arms, this time on the floor.  Again, the moves here were easier to follow and included some tough triceps work.  This section includes a brief set of pushups as well as bicep concentration curls done in a kneeling position.  In the fourth and final section, Faith returns to the abs--for those of you familiar with the Quick Fix Tight Abs video, you'll recognize the music!  In both abs sections, Faith does a variety of moves that are easy to follow and well-cued.
So overall, I liked the abs parts of this workout better than the arms parts, and I especially didn't like the more complex choreography in the first section.  Those who enjoy The Firm videos might find the style of video more enjoyable than I did, although they might also be disappointed with the difficulty level.",1029283200,,2074,4.722222222222222
