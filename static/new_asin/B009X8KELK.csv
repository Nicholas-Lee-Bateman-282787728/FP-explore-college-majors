8544883,2,B009X8KELK,"This was released in 2012 by a German company but it bears the name Blockbuster so that dates it and my guess is it was made maybe 10 years before that. You can choose German or Chinese and English subtitles and 2D or 3D but the 3D is not only fake but an older type fake that is rather poor. The acting and directing is not bad but the film is very low budget and is often comical due to bad script with many inconsistencies. Nevertheless we (I a senior expert in 3D and my Chinese wife) found the 3D an enhancement and the unintentional comedy enjoyable, so it rates higher than most Hollywood films in our view.",1454284800,,614,4.211864406779661
