Yeah, it'll take a couple of tries to watch it all the way through, but that is part of the point. DVD players don't come with ""random"" buttons alas (unlike CD players), but that might be a good way of viewing it. Rent, don't buy unless you're sure you want what's on here!",1253577600,6,426,4.4743589743589745
8185053,4,B000LC52A0,"I bought ""Thee Films"" roughly 15 years ago on VHS and was extremely happy to see it available on DVD. It's quite possible that you will not get through the entire piece in one viewing, but I don't believe that is the way they were intended to be seen. Enjoy it in segments and keep your mind clear. Let the visual and audio flow without too much thought. It is most likely that you have never seen anything quite like this before! I recommend this to all that can't get enough of this late literary outlaw.",1232323200,6,506,4.28125
8185054,2,B000LC52A0,"This is very strange, I would only recomend this to fans of Burrough's more cut up experimental books. This reminds me of an acid trip it is very bizarre. One short film just has a bizarre picture of some sort of skulls on the screen and it has Burroughs repeating one short sentence over and over again. Bill and Tony is extremely bizarre it involves Burroughs and another person stood next to each other one saying ""I am Bill"" and one saying ""I am Tony"" Then Tony will tell a story then the same sequence will start again with Bill telling the story, then Tony will become Bill etc and the story is told around 8 times in different ways. This dvd is basically unwatchable but it is great to have in your collection if your a true fan of Burroughs. Also if you dabble with music the Bill and Tony film would be amazing to sample.",1228176000,7,830,4.292993630573249
