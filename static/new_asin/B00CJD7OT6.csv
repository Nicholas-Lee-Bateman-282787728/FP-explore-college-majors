8582489,5,B00CJD7OT6,"It has been suggested that this film is a gallic style Diary of a Wimpy Kid type of film. In both style and approach it is very much closer to the wonderful 1980 Australian Classic 'Fatty Finn', and is much the better film as a result, especially for the adults in the audience. Maxime Godart apparently effortlessly becomes the character of Nicolas, who has a very clear take on events around him, as most boys his age do. This film brings back to me all the joys and fears of my own eight year old life, and it is a joy to see that the rest of the cast get into the spirit of Nicolas' world with relish. Watch this film, and enjoy being a child again! Better still, watch it with your own children and enjoy being the same age as them!",1391558400,2,737,4.160839160839161
