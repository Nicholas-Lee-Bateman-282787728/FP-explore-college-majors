Buy this set for Millenium... watch it... you think about it... you will not ever regret it.  I promise!",1452729600,12,259,4.244897959183674
7539037,4,B0182YFY9W,"This combo blu ray is a massive draw for me with Millennium
Based on a novel by John Varley Millennium is a late 1980's sci-fi film that is super unique and different
some of it seems far fetched but, once you watch the film at least once it will stay with you and  not in a bad way

the cast is a decent late 80's cast
Kris Kristofferson  as Bill Smith
Cheryl Ladd  as  Louise Baltimore (Ladd looks stunning in this flick)
Daniel J. Travanti  as  Arnold Mayer
Robert Joy  as  Sherman

It's really hard to even try and explain this film
A airline crash  investigator (Kris Kristofferson) is investigating this bizarre airline crash  while he's looking into this he meets
Cheryl Ladd.... Ladd seduces Bill to get information
Bill comes to find out that Louise is from the future
Time Travelers from the future are taking people from the past before they die in plane crashes to help re-populated the future
all this might sound a bit over the top/ convoluted but, the story plays out very good
It'll make you think.........................
The only major draw back to this film is some of the F/X look dated but, it was 1989 I'm sure it had a average budget

I've always loved this film mostly cause it has such a great idea
These are people from the future actually trying to do the right thing (Not here to terminate some young woman)
Hopefully this blu-ray combo has some type of exclusive extras
at least port the  second ending from the old out of print dvd
If you are fan of the Time Travel genre (Back to the Future, Doctor Who, Quantum Leap, Sliders, My Science Project, Etc) Check it out at least once it's super under-rated and very thought provoking  8/10

8741264,5,B0182YFY9W,"Scream Factory again rescues two late 80's cult classics from possible obscurity in this bluray double feature pairing ""Millenium"" (1989) and ""R.O.T.O.R"" (1988).

""Millenium"" is a time travel/sci-fI concoction featuring an interesting story, undercooked dialogue, bad acting and Kris Kristofferson. While it has its fans, I have never been one of them but it does contain some very interesting ideas that would be ripe for a remake by more seasoned filmmakers.

The main reason that I wanted this bluray was due to ""R.O.T.O.R."" finally being available in high definition widescreen. A no budget mashup of The Terminator & Robocop, it is part of the cream of the crop as far as so bad it's great cinema is concerned. It truly has to be seen to be believed. It has been discussed on whether the filmmakers were trying to make something truly good and failed or if this was some kind of a send up of sorts. It is just so strangely written and executed from the top down. While clearly filmed in English, most of the dialogue appears to be dubbed. ""R.O.T.O.R"" is simply bad movie nirvana!

""Millenium"" is presented in 1.85:1 widescreen and ""R.O.T.O.R."" in 1.78:1. Both films were scanned from their original camera negatives and look fantastic. (The title card of ""R.O.T.O.R."" features its original title of ""Blue Steel"" by the way.) Detail is superb and despite both films sharing a dual-layered bluray, no compression artifacts were to be seen. They both feature healthy bit rates way up in the mid 30's often times. Audio is presented in lossless 2 channel stereo. The only extras are a trailer for each film.

While it might on paper look like an odd pairing, this bluray double feature is still a lot of fun for fans of either film. They each look the best they probably ever have and sound great too.",1472256000,4,1802,4.784565916398714
8741265,5,B0182YFY9W,"Millennium is not good. It's not awesomely bad either. It's watchable but not worth watching in the least.

R.O.T.O.R. on the other hand is what makes this purchase worthwhile. Oh my goodness, I don't even know where to begin. Dubbing, ridiculous narration, a bit of stop motion special effects, and a completely terrible and quotable script. It makes Robocop look like arthouse. Oh, does it feel like unearthing some obscure straight to video VHS at the back of the video store except wow, the blu-ray transfer is fantastic. I would watch this on repeat.",1465689600,2,555,4.904255319148936
8741266,5,B0182YFY9W,"I give Millennium five stars because I think this movie is brilliant and worth watching again and again. R.O.T.O.R. however must rate as one of the worst movies I have ever seen, believe me I have seen a few. The least said about the acting and the special effects the better.
I will recommend this double feature for Millennium alone, the other movie can be ignored.",1463702400,2,367,4.575757575757576
8741267,5,B0182YFY9W,"Millennium is the cult movie it deserves to be.  I saw it (censored on TV) years ago and wanted to see it again.  The cigarette smoking is the worst thing about Millennium.  Honestly, I have not watched ROTOR yet.  M is sufficient to the price of the disc.  I think M might just be a satire of the present world.  Let's get out of it soon to a brighter city?  Should we want to go ahead in time?  Ok.",1462579200,2,400,3.9746835443037973

8741269,4,B0182YFY9W,"The R.O.T.O.R. video gives fans of the movie what we've been waiting for: a crisp, clear, undamaged, and wonderfully watchable transfer of this So-Bad-It's-Good film. No more suffering through dreadful pan-and-scan Mill Creek Entertainment DVD's or iffy VHS bootlegs. This is the REAL DEAL and it looks great.

It has the alternate ""BLUE STEEL"" title card in place of the normal ""R.O.T.O.R."" screen but the remainder of the movie seems to be unchanged. I found the sound quality to be a little tinny and flat, but given the film's bargain-basement production values, this is probably a reflection of a poor-quality original rather than the Blu-ray.

The only reasons I give the Blu-ray 4 stars rather than 5 is (a) the dearth of special features and (b) the fact that the movie is split into only 8 chapters, and the screenshots in Chapter Selection menu don't perfectly correspond with each starting point, making it hard to find the scene you want.

Oh yeah, the movie? You have to love truly bad cinema to appreciate this one.

The movie is not really a straight-up ripoff of Robocop as is often parroted onlineit's more of a low-budget Judge Dredd with a dash of The Terminator thrown inand it's not as boring as some other infamous sci-fi trash, but that's about all the good that can be said about it. Most of the acting is wooden. Much of the dialogue is badly looped, for historically unclear reasons, given that it's an American production (presumably) shot in English. The script is so verbose that it verges on being nearly incomprehensible in places. The comedy-relief robot character is inane and not funny. The first half of the movie proceeds at a snail's pace, and when the action finally picks up in the second half, we're treated to some of the worst fight choreography since 'Dolemite'. The premise has holes large enough to drive a truck through. (The robot won't be ready for 25 years, but he can be activated by a badly-placed pair of headphones, and he already has a locker. a uniform, and a motorcycle?) The movie has more continuity errors than a Jean Claude Van Damme film has roundhouse kicks.

So why even bother?

If you love a film that's so bad you can make fun of it non-stop, this one is *great*.",1456704000,9,2229,4.717223650385604
