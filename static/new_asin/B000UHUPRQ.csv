8213341,5,B000UHUPRQ,"I have not yet seen this DVD, but have experienced a couple of forms of specialized kinesiolgy and would have to agree that it is really weird especially if you have no context for these kinds of modalities. I went to a kinesiologist to get over my lack of self confidence and fear around giving seminars. 4 sessions later I can now do this. In addition to accomplishing this goal I've noticed a generalization affect were I am much less self critical and reproachful of myself.

What I like about this stuff is that my belief is not required for it to work. What I now understand is that whatever is going on in your life is reflected in your body. There is no real separation between the two just as there is no real separation between what's going in your mind and body and your energy.

Most of us have difficulty accomplishing things in our life, not due to a lack of talent, but do to a lack of inner alignment or coherence between  us and what we desire. You can think of it as mind body energy alignement. If the mind wants something and the energy and body don't support this want, chances are that you won't accomplish it (if you do it will be with much struggle and anguish). We can achieve in a more powerful way if the 3 parts are movin' in the same direction. Kinesiology helps to uncover where this misalignment is and also helps to remove it.

Your body IS an energy emitter that has polarity just liek a battery. This polarity changes in response to how stressed and tired you are. The top of your head has a polarity as does the palms of your hands, and you can test if your polarity is balanced. If your polarity is generally balanced then mucle testing with your open palm above the the top of your head creates a locked muscle response (a + - connection). If you turn your hand over and muscle test, it will weaken because you are combining + + or - - (I don't remember whether the head should be + or -). If however your polarity is off then the muscle response while testing will be the opposite, that is, weak when open palm is above head and strong when palm facing up above head.

The more you learn about energy and the body and the mind it starts to make a lot more sense why rubbing up and down on someone spine (spinal reflex points from Touch for Health Kinesiology) can help correct an upset stomach.
My 2 cents for anyone who cares.",1211414400,9,2365,4.29372197309417
8213342,2,B000UHUPRQ,So you watch this guy - Ernest Solivan explain how the brain works and he uses his terms. And then his method for opening mental blockages is to touch your thumb and finger together and say relax. After telling your sub conscious and conscious to work it out. And then he's up there testing how hard he can push down on your arm and touching your right side of your head or the left to tell if one side of the brain is off. I don't beleive this works. The cost is not worth what you get. Not much. I recommend Joel Osteen or Glenn Harrold for changing the way you think is a much better investment. PS. Ernest's friends must have wrote the good reviews. I give it two stars because the explanation of how the brain works and fails sounded interesting.,1210204800,5,751,4.258741258741258
8213343,5,B000UHUPRQ,"""The material presented on your DVD was most informative, easy to absorb &
the examples offered granted further clarity. Your reference to the
'Critical Factor'(CF) provided a refreshing and somewhat different way of
understanding the nature of the 'gate keeper' or CF, as you call it. The
idea of a CF influence does resonate as I have sensed a certain 'unknown'
was there influencing, rather,(sabotaging) my intended processes of change. With this additional awareness I feel confident in peeling more layers away as I now have more knowledge. Thank you for sharing your wisdom""
