The writing and acting were exceptional (especially for a low-budget Christian film), and, as another poster wrote, it made me both laugh and cry.  ""Real"" shows how God's love has changed real people's lives, and it just might change yours, too.",1344643200,6,351,4.833333333333333
4525977,5,B0051T47M2,"Life stories written by the one true God who sent his one and only begotten son, that whosoever believes in him shall not perish but have everlasting life. The gift of salvation and eternal life is not something we can earn, but only something we can receive and praise God almighty for! Jesus' very name means ""Lord that saves""
This movie is powerful and God is waiting to change the lifes of people whom watch it, for he gifted the writer and director with the tools to create it :]",1332115200,9,484,4.388888888888889
4525978,5,B0051T47M2,I initially did not have high expectations for this low budget film but was amazed at the life lessons that were taught in such a way to relate to nearly every viewer.  The acting was solid and it truly gives hope and meaning to a person who is struggling to figure out what this life is all about...This movie is a MUST see for all families (there is one violent scene that may not be appropriate for young viewers).  I laughed and I cried!  Five Stars!!!!!,1324339200,10,458,4.3023255813953485
8453225,2,B0051T47M2,This dvd had several stories of people and their encounter with Jesus. I however found the character they portrayed as Jesus to ne weak. Our Lord is strong and would not allow Satan to dunk his head under water like that. A totally bad representation of Jesus,1470268800,,259,4.531914893617022

8453231,4,B0051T47M2,"If you are looking for a movie with a great message about where God is in life sometimes, this is the movie for you. The production and acting are a little sub-par but you tend to quickly forget that as you delve deeper into the movie. The movie shows you where Jesus can actually be in your life in crappy situations. Well worth the watch.",1394409600,,340,4.246153846153846
8453232,3,B0051T47M2,This movie was too drab and it brought me down.  There is a good message but you really have to look for it,1390003200,,107,3.652173913043478
8453233,4,B0051T47M2,"""Real"" tells four different stories of lives.  The stories are not far fetched in their possibility.  We all probably know at least one person who has lived a life quite similar yet different in their own way.  We all make choices and we are impacted by those choices.  The results from those choices is ours, but the chance to do something different is also ours.  Change is not easy.  Doing something different from what we did to get us to where we are is a process that is usually less than a good time, but with God all things are possible.  Living in a rut of the results of bad choices is not living the life God created you to live.  He has so much better for you.  This film shows you this.

If you are looking for a high budget film, this isn't for you.  The message however is well worth it.  God cares about you and wants to be there for you.  Even with the most difficult circumstances, there are often two choices...choose life.  ""Real"" is well acted.  The message is pure and clear and delivered in an honest way.  Not everyone has a great budget, but that doesn't mean a film doesn't have a great message.  Give it a chance.  I believe you'll like it.  I did.

This is a faith based film with a great message.  As I often review family friendly films, I want to stress that I would not watch this with a young child.  There is some violent imagery and some grown up subject matter.  Things are done tastefully, but still I would not watch this with younger than say age 14.  And I would watch it with them so you could discuss it afterwards.  Watch it yourself first though, because you know what you would allow your child to see.",1364688000,,1647,4.26948051948052
