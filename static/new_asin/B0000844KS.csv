This comes from the same artist (Peter Chung) that brought us Aeon Flux. If you're a fan of that series or animation in general at all, i highly recommend getting this set.",1410566400,,283,4.795918367346939

I have never seen one done this was, but it is artisticly very different. Being a lover of philosopy and history, I found keeping the truth of the time in a otherworld creation very cool.

More for the thinker type people of our world.",1299369600,,377,4.463768115942029
