7670788,5,B01BX2AY4A,"This enchanting romp through Shakespeare's Lost Years will delight you.  A brilliant piece from the original Horrible Histories team and the creators of Yonderland (please let's get these available in the US as well).  Take a true affection and respect for Shakespeare, add in some subtle Star Wars and Holy Grail homages with a touch of Blackadder-esque color, mix with great writing and terrific acting talents, toss in Damien Lewis and Helen McCrory, stir with a lovely soundtrack and fine direction, and you have a terrific confection.  Lit teachers, take note of this one.  Families, settle onto the couch and enjoy.  Shakespeare aficionados, you will find many friends here.  Have fun!",1461542400,5,691,5.18018018018018
7670789,4,B01BX2AY4A,"This is a must-see for fans of the HH-Yonderland team, and though it doesn't reach the heights of brilliance of their best work it's still an entertaining showcase for their smart, snarky style of entertainment. I think that as with Horrible Histories there's a kernel of truth in all the nonsense, especially in the depiction of Shakespeare's relationship with his wife Anne. The fact that he went to London to seek his fortune and she stayed in Stratford with the kids doesn't necessarily mean he ended up boinking Gwyneth Paltrow. The necessary selfishness that drives an artist doesn't rule out his being a loving family man, and I like to think of Shakespeare more as Matt Baynton than Joseph Fiennes.",1459900800,2,706,4.891666666666667

7670791,4,B01BX2AY4A,"This movie supposedly explains Shakespeare's ""missing years"" 1585 - 1592.  Though Shakespeare and Anne Hathaway only married in 1582 in this movie the three children are almost ""school age.""

Also the first Spanish Armada was launched in May 1588, but what was left of it  limped back to Spain after September 1588.

7670796,2,B01BX2AY4A,"I want to preface this with saying that I am a high school English teacher and am absolutely in love with the hilarious series Horrible Histories and especially their skits on Elizabethan times, so after reading the reviews for Bill it was an easy decision to buy this DVD... I was horribly, horribly disappointed and am not sure where the people writing the positive reviews are coming from. It's obvious that a lot of love went into this and the cast does a fantastic job playing multiple roles, but this film doesn't appear to know what it wants to be. The costumes and sets are perfect as a period piece, but the film can't decide whether it wants to be a by-the-numbers adventure story (read: not a comedy,)  or a series of anachronistic farces (which for the most part fail to hit Monty Python marks.) Ultimately I can't recommend this film to anyone - it's too unfunny (despite that the box says) for adults, and the surprising inclusion of sex jokes makes this inappropriate for children. (Yes, I'm aware the Bard knew how to insert a good penis joke, but the ones in here are pretty blunt.)",1487203200,4,1099,4.5786802030456855

There are parts where i think the characters are being a little cheeky but i am not aware of what they are saying so it doesn't bother me. The songs are so funny and fantastic and very entertaining.  The story is admittedly very unlikely to be even close to what Shakespeare experienced in the start of his career, but there are historic events tied into the whole thing to keep you guessing.",1468022400,,737,4.575757575757576

7670830,4,B01BX2AY4A,"This movie is fun for all ages- it is something that you can watch with your children and enjoy yourself.  The troupe of actors who brought you Horrible Histories, and now Yonderland, work together to bring you Bill- the story of Bill Shakespeare.  Unlike with Horrible Histories, where most of the history is historically accurate, I do not think there was any truth beyond names of historic figures in this story.  This is why I gave the movie 4 stars instead of 5, I may be having to re-explain Tudor England to my niece and nephew in the future.

None the less, the team made an excellent movie.  The central cast all play multiple roles, and do it well.  I laughed out loud a few times and in general enjoyed the story.  More so than anything, I want more of their shows made available in the United States.  I truly enjoyed Yonderland but it is almost impossible to find in our country.

This would be a good gift for ages 5-12 probably, or for any adult who enjoyed Monthy Python- a lot of jokes were inspired from their early British comedy troupe forefathers.

I am reviewing this movie in an effort to help other Amazon customers by relaying my experience with the film and providing any insight I garnered.

7670833,5,B01BX2AY4A,"Saw this in theatre during it's one night showing. Laughed long and loud. Outstanding punning and clever things throughout.

7670834,5,B01BX2AY4A,"I never cared for monty python much (except spamalot) but I love Shakespeare and really enjoyed this.  For me, King Phillip really stole the show!",1463529600,,146,4.84
7670835,5,B01BX2AY4A,"It's 1593, ""A time of war and plague. But mostly war.""
King Philip II of Spain is still smarting from the failure of his great Armada. Fortunately for his ego, Queen Elizabeth's pet privateer, Sir Richard Hawkins, is captured trying to rob the Madrid palace.  This gives the King a great excuse to ask for a Summit meeting in England. A Trojan Horse  to get him close enough to kill the Queen.

That sounds almost serious. But not in this movie! Hapless henchmen abound  on both sides. And, in the meanwhile, back in Stratford upon Avon, 30 year-old Bill Shakespeare has just gotten kicked out of his band, the Mortal Coil. But not to worry, he tells his long-suffering wife, he has a new way to make a living. He's going to write plays.

This film answers a question that's puzzled experts for decades. What was Shakespeare doing in his ""lost years"".  In 1585 he's in Stratford upon Avon with a wife and three kids.  In 1593 he's an actor and playwright alone in London. How did he get from one to the other?

I laughed out loud many times during this movie. The dialogue is delicious. Lots of quotes and allusions to Shakespeare's writings, of course, usually with a humorous bent. Such as when Will is telling Anne how he is meant to be a writer: ""It's like the words flow through me. Like I'm the East and they're the sun.""

Some of the acting is extraordinary, especially Ben Willbond  as King Philip. The plot has twists and turns. The humor isn't just in the dialogue, there is lots of physical comedy, too. There are even musical interludes.  And the occasional reference to writing other than Shakespeare: ""Quickly. Poor people are easily startled, but they'll soon be back. And in greater numbers.""

""Bill"" was originally released in the theaters in the U.K. in September 2015. It's a family film and runs 94 minutes. The DVD presents the film in 2.35:1 aspect ratio and Dolby Digital 5.1. English SDH subtitles are available for the movie and the four Bonus Features.

Bonus Features:
....1.  ""The Making of 'Bill'"" (10 minutes) Commentators include Tony Bracewell (producer), Laurence Rickard (co-writer and plays Walsingham), Charles Stock (producer), Alastair Flind (producer), Mathew Baynton (plays Bill), Ben Willbond (co-writer, plays King Philip), Richard Bracewell (director), Simon Farnaby (plays Earl of Croyden), Martha Howe-Douglas (plays Anne Shakespeare), Jim Howick (plays Christopher Marlowe) and Nadia Stacey (hair and makeup).
For the actors, I only list the main characters they play. Most of the actors played several parts  just like in Shakespeare's day! It was a good joke on myself, though, that I didn't notice this as I watched the movie the first time. Then it's mentioned in this Bonus and the light dawned.
Willbond tells us, ""We just thought it'd be fun for the audience to know that Shakespeare is going to appear at some stage [as] the Shakespeare that everyone knows, the guy who wrote these amazing works of art. But, but what if he was a bit of a loser before that?... What if he was just like all of us?""
Richard Bracewell: ""We had so much material.... and we kept cutting it down, it was very hard to cut down because there were these scenes we really loved."" My question to him is, Why Aren't These Deleted Scenes a DVD Extra? I'd love to see them.
....2.  ""A Day in the Life With Mathew Baynton"" (3 minutes) His day on the set starts at 7:10 am. This follows him on the day they film his first scenes in the movie, even though it's his next-to-last day of filming.
....3.  ""Bringing Tudor London to the Dales"" (6 minutes) Ben Willbond takes us around all the London sets. Incredibly, they are all constructed within the ruins of Bolton Castle, North Yorkshire.
....4.  ""There's Something About Shakespeare"" (6 minutes) Members of the cast and crew give a round robin of facts about Shakespeare. Such as: ""Some people don't believe Shakespeare wrote his own plays. One Englishman, in 1918, claimed that the Earl of Oxford had written all of Shakespeare's plays, and he'd died even before Shakespeare had written most of them. That man's name was Thomas Looney.""
In case you have questions yourself, I'll refer you to a book I greatly enjoyed, Bill Bryson's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Shakespeare-The-World-as-Stage-Eminent-Lives/dp/0061673692/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Shakespeare: The World as Stage (Eminent Lives)</a>

This is a goofy fluffy movie. You have to put on your silly hat and go merrily with the flow.

""Saying things in a short, snappy way, instead of a long drawn-out way is the soul of wit.""

7670839,4,B01BX2AY4A,"I haven't seen Yonderland or Horrible Histories, and I don't know these actors. The humor is definitely BBC, and while I think it's more targeted to adults who will appreciate the literary and historical references, there's also room for family viewing. I am reminded of Monty Python. The story has a playful farce to it's flow, with offbeat, inane anachronisms, and crumbs of dark humor expected for the year 1593. The cinematography is perfectly fine. The actors have talent... indeed, many carried multiple roles and it worked! I enjoyed them all - from the spoofy Sir Walsingham, to the effeminate English Nobility, to the roguish Spanish assassins, all the way to the rotten-toothed Queen Elizabeth. There was an undeniable attraction (and angst) between Bill and Anne, and the cast of surrounding medieval characters were well-played. Memorable. Not epic, not gut ripping funny... but delightfully Brit-odd. This is not Hollywood... you don't have massive explosions or huge plot arcs. You need to like Brit humor to really savor this film... it's both subtle and in-your-face. Not every gag fit the piece or delivered the big laughs... and that was okay.

Parental Advisory: It's surprisingly clean, except for perhaps the dark humor, which children might find a bit ""icky"" in spots. Children also may not appreciate the references and homages.

On the whole, this one made 4 out of 5 stars on my Indie scale... adjust your expectations for the BBC and the pacing of Brit-humor, and I think you'll enjoy this offering.",1462320000,9,1525,5.0717131474103585
