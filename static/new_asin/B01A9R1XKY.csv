8746769,5,B01A9R1XKY,"This is a delightful take on Cinderella! I love that the heroine is much more developed and interesting than previous renditions, and the theme of ""Have courage and be kind"" was refreshing. The bullying was intense and poignant, Cate Blanchett is at her absolute best, the costuming was spectacular. If your children liked the animated version, this is an essential addition to your collection when they are ready for it.",1515456000,,421,5.0285714285714285
