3870157,5,B00280LRH0,"I started practicing Kenjtsu in about 3 years ago and I have been practicing Kenjutsu from Sensei Tarver's DVDs for a little over a year.  I was thrilled when I found them because I had just moved to a tiny town in the middle of nowhere and I was afraid that I would not be able to continue studying Kenjutsu.  Sensei Tarver prevents the techniques from multiple angles and explains the process of each technique, as well as the practical usage.  Kenjtsu: The Art of the Samurai has allowed me to continue doing something I love.",1258588800,4,529,4.489583333333333
3870158,4,B00280LRH0,"Sensei Tarver presents his material clearly and simply.  This gives an individual the ability to learn swordsmanship in a broken down way without taking years to study it.

Sensei Tarver,
I just wanted to drop you a note about a sword student of mine.  When one of my sword students went to New Tork recently to visit some relatives, he was able to train at a Yagyu Shingen Ryu dojo.  They were very impressed with his sword ability and technique.  He was in fact able to beat all of the students during the sparring portion of the classes, except for the most senior student (the son of the instructor).  They even asked him to teach them the 'chopping block', and the (head level) extened swinging cut to them.  They were also very impressed how fast he was , and that he was able to block and counter behind their attacks.  Like you say, ""take the head!""

I just wanted you to know that your instruction hasn't gone in vain and I am continuing to teach in the best way possible based on your teachings.

8355333,5,B00280LRH0,very informative.,1450310400,,17,8.0
8355334,4,B00280LRH0,I just finished watching vol. 1 and thought it was great.  I have been teaching Martial Arts for 7 years and I'm always looking for new and different ways to learn.  I'm so glad I bought vol. 1-3 and will continue to buy the rest of the series.  Tarver Sensei is the first to explain that concepts of Jutsu and DO are different and this is NOT a traditional and custom type of video.  It has some customs and tradition but is mostly practical ways to use the sword.  Tarver says it is not the only way and learn what works for you and discard what doesn't.  I teach the exact same way and I thought it was a great video and concepts.  Tarver talks a lot about Musashi and his ideals which is also really good.,1397347200,,709,4.131386861313868
8355335,4,B00280LRH0,"For a starter video it was pretty good. This is my first in the series and I will buy at least one more. But I really didn,t care for SOME of the extra content at the end, seemed like filler and at 27 bucks a pop I will need more tutorial and less filler. But Sensai Tarver does know his stuff. Looking forward to my next lesson!",1357084800,,329,3.925373134328358
8355336,5,B00280LRH0,i bought this dvd and im glad i did. i plan on buying 1-20! the details are excellent. Dwayne goes over history and other stuff as well.,1316390400,,136,4.074074074074074
8355337,5,B00280LRH0,Sensei Tarver instructional DVDs are some of the bestI've seen out there. They are very easy to follow and tradition behind each one is wonderful. I recommend them to any Samurai sword practitioner. As matter of fact I plan to buy to whole vol 20 set. Thanks Sensei Tarver.,1303862400,3,273,4.591836734693878
8355338,1,B00280LRH0,"I have trained for almost 30 years to include aikido, iaido and sword work.  I did not find the reviews useful.  I found the DVD very unenlightening.  It is not clear about his history and the credibility of his knowledge base.  The first impression is he talks too much on random ideas and strays from the topic.  His concept does not appear to be based on any budo principles. It covers initially about how to tie a belt.  If you do not know how to tie a belt, you should not purchase this rather than attend a real class.  It covers the folding of the hakama.  It does not appear he has a clear grasp of the process as he is very clumsy.  He does not cover and probably does not understand the true meaning of the hakama and the values that the 7 pleats represent.  He does not tie the hakama in a traditional fashion.  His sword work is rather unconventional.  Even if there is no Kenjutsu dojo, the DVD is not worth it.  It will teach you poor technique and bad habits.  Go to You Tube and search Kuroda Sensei.  That is tradional Kenjutsu.  Or find a class that teaches Iaido about how to dress, proper etiquette of handling the sword, drawing the sword and sword cuts if you are serious about the katanna or sword.  His uke or assistant in the DVD does not cut with purpose.  The only item in the DVD that relates to ""The Art of the Samurai"" is the presence of a bokken.  Go to [...] if you are serious about Kenjutsu as this, I feel, it the essence of Samurai.",1301184000,8,1468,4.215827338129497
8355339,5,B00280LRH0,"I studied under Sensei Tarver during the 90's and learned so much from him.  He works hard to study each style he concentrates on for practicality and truth.  He does not take things at face value, instead digging deep to make sure everything he teaches is as pure a form as possible.

I have personal experience studying beside him in kenjutsu and can attest to his focus, talent, and dedication to the art.  Any instructional videos by Sensei Tarver will be a treat to any owner.",1274918400,2,481,4.558139534883721
8355340,5,B00280LRH0,"I started training in Kenjutsu using this series a few years ago when you could only get the DVDs from Sensei Tarver himself.  I was never able to finish collecting the series and am glad to have found these DVD's here to finish and continue my training.

Sensei Tarver is a straight forward and down to earth instructor.  Being a martial arts instructor myself, I was able to relate to his teaching method and thoughts regarding the martial arts.  I had always wanted to learn the sword, but due to work scheduling, my own teaching and finances I was never able to make classes at any local dojo.  This way I was able to learn on my own time and at my own pace.

I highly suggest this series to anyone interested in learning the art of Kenjutsu.",1269734400,5,746,4.369565217391305
8355341,5,B00280LRH0,"I have been involved in Japanese martial arts for forty years, but until recently, I have not trained with the Japanese sword. There is no Kenjutsu instruction available where I live, so I purchased Sensei Tarer's instructional series and I couldn't be happier!!

Sensei Tarver's instruction is very clear, comprehensive and down to earth. As a retired U.S. Marine, I especially like Tarver, Sensei's very realistic approach, as this is why I want to learn the blade.

I want to highly recommend this series to everybody!!",1267228800,5,522,5.058139534883721
