8433315,1,B004KRQFQM,There was very little above the earth photography. Mostly some guy babbling about what should have been shown.,1464480000,,110,5.166666666666667

8433317,4,B004KRQFQM,"It's not simply an aerial photography disk, it's a video about the declining habitat for animal species.  If you agree that this is a problem you'll enjoy this video.  The 1 star ratings are from folks who are obviously irritated by that message. I deducted one star because the description should have been more clear that the video has a very strong habitat conservation message - honesty is always best.",1440201600,3,406,4.785714285714286
8433318,1,B004KRQFQM,"actual ""from above"" ---- 20% of total footage at most!!!  To those who like it, how about try to save this EARTH by first spreading the idea of getting rid of some humans.",1439596800,,171,4.181818181818182
8433319,5,B004KRQFQM,"My husband and I loved this film very much but still cannot understand why the 2 CDs are listed as #1 and #2 when they are the exact, identical CDs!  Why would they put 2 identical CDs in the same box listing then as #1 and #2?  Just didn't make any sense to us and frankly we were a bit disappointed that there wasn't a second CD to view.  This is an outstanding CD although a bit environmentally preachy.  We enjoyed it a lot and I would recommend purchasing this CD to everyone!",1420502400,,481,4.139784946236559

8433322,1,B004KRQFQM,This was one of three disks i purchaced at the same time. I stopped watching this one half way through. I will never buy any disk that has Yann Artus Bertrand associated with it. Waste of momey!,1363996800,4,194,4.27027027027027
8433323,5,B004KRQFQM,Earth From Above: Life is outstanding.  It emphasizes the need for humans to respect and take care of the earth and its environment.  The pictures are superb and the program makes the viewer at least think.  There are other discs in this series.  I strongly recommend viewing these discs.,1348704000,4,288,4.816326530612245
