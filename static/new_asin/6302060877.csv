He told me the real story but the story that was doctored out of the footage and played on tv made Warrens out to be some kind of hero whereas those that were there would tell a different story. When the team had already lost a raft and much of their supplies and it was obvious they were in over their heads, the leader, Warrens loaded up a backpack and walked off. My friend caught up to him and asked what he was doing and he responded it was over and every man for himself and then he walked away, abandoning his team. He wasn't a real leader, he was out for personal glory. My buddy was so pissed about it that he couldn't talk about it for a long time.",1376265600,,791,3.95
7820328,5,6302060877,"I was hired for the summer in 1978 as a rafting crewman by Lute Jerstad Adventures (LJA) between my junior and senior years at Stanford University.  I already had some experience and expertise at reading water, which probably helped me get the job: my father, brother and I ran streches of a minor Ganges river tributary, the beautiful Ramganga river, in the middle 1960's and my family had been running Oregon's wild Deschutes river in our jet boat while I was in high school in Portland.

In my first trip with LJA, I rode through the night from Portland to Hells Canyon dam on the Snake, with Warrem telling us of great rafting adventures, especially upstream on the remote Owyhee tributary.  When we pushed off the next morning, as a newbie I was given responsibility for rowing alone the big 18-foot baggage raft. It was a blast, since the raft was well nigh unflippable and one could guide it through big water that smaller, client-manned, rafts wisely would avoid.

Ken certainly was a skilled waterman but he and his staff had an unbending management style that grated on me more and more as the summer wore on.  As I recall, Ken spoke to others pretty much only his own terms in a ""this is it"", ""my way or the highway"" manner.  I ended up despising some of the decisions, was probably seen as disloyal and so spent nearly the whole summer back with the baggage raft (mostly fine by me, by the way).  After my last trip Ken rang me up, furious that I had questioned as reckless his sleepy deputy's decision to be the only one driving all four or five of us back 300 miles from the river to Portland.  ""You're fired"" he yelled and I yelled back ""only Jerstad can fire me, and anyway I quit!"".

In 1986, as fate would have it, I was a first-tour Foreign Service Officer in Canton, China and one of two at the consulate who met with the four ""mutineers"" mentioned in the comment above, after Warren's Yangtze expedition blew up and the four left the river.  From my experience with Warren, their account rang true and I told them so.

I believe Warren had great raw courage.  But the young man from Idaho, David Shippee, showed at least as much bravery under the circumstances, I think.  He signed on for a grand adventure, then encountered life-threatening risks, but nonetheless still faced them all by himself and so kept his bond to his teammates and to the expedition.",1263081600,,2378,4.540983606557377
