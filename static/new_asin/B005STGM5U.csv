8485450,2,B005STGM5U,"Where did these other reviews come from? This started out okay, got stupid REALLY early on, the acting is pretty bad, and I couldn't bring myself to finish it! Maybe it gets better, but I seriously doubt it.",1508198400,,207,4.473684210526316
8485451,4,B005STGM5U,"A really cute show.  Well produced and acted.  A bit predictable, but well done.  I can't quite give it five stars, because then how would I rate Star Wars, Avatar or Raiders of the Lost Ark?

8485453,5,B005STGM5U,"I bought this movie for my son as a gift and did not plan on watching it myself, however, when I heard him laughing in the other room, I decided to see what was so funny about it. Honestly, the acting was really well done by everyone in the small cast, especially by the man who played the father and the young woman who plays the love-interest.

Without giving away the full plot, the movie is about the relationship between a late-20's son and his father who is getting divorced and needs a place to stay. They find themselves competing for the same woman, who has just taken a job at the son's company. It seems like a simplistic plot that you might think you've seen before, but it came off as a totally original take on family rivalries. The film hits on some great emotional honesty while providing unexpected laughter on a very regular basis.

BIG RECOMMENDATION!!! You will laugh a lot when you watch this.",1326585600,4,914,4.467065868263473
