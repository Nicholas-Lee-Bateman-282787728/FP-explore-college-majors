8074266,5,B000A40IJE,"If you can get a hold of this, this is a fantastic Dallas reunion film.  It's got everything good about the series plus it took it to a whole other level.  You've got JR, Bobby, Cliff, and Sue Ellen alongside the next generation of Ewings, as well as other familiar faces from the show like Afton Cooper and Carter McKay.  Leonard Katzman was the main genius behind Dallas and this was his final project before his untimely death-the film is a testament to all those years of prime time quality and is a quality work itself.  I don't think I even really have to describe the plot for Dallas fans to want this-JR comes back to town and everybody is going to get what's coming to them.  It's good fun, and you know you want to see it.",1194739200,3,732,4.27536231884058
