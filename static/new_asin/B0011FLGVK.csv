8241606,2,B0011FLGVK,Skip this series. The narration is poor propoganda narration from WW2 and the film selection is not very impressive. The coverage of the second world war is much better addressed in many other productions making this series barely watchable to history buffs.,1274227200,6,258,5.166666666666667
