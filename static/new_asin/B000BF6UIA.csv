I feel very confident letting her watch this on her own as well because Horatio says all of the things that I would say while watching with her to keep her engaged in a show she is watching.  Things like... what sound does a cow make? and what are some things that are yellow?..etc.
My daughter really loves that there are actual kids in the video, all I have to do is look at her face and observe her reaction to see what a wonderful time she is having.  When Horatio does his ""peek-a-boo"" it's non-stop giggles.  We love this DVD!",1241049600,,801,4.348993288590604
8086095,1,B000BF6UIA,"Hopelessly lacking in wit, intelligence, or creativity. Lame animation, ultra-low tech computer graphics. Annoying narration, reminiscent of a puppet show put on by 8 year olds (""now I'm walking over here, doh de doh""). Normally I would donate unwanted videos to the local public library. I threw this one in the trash instead.",1188518400,,327,5.188679245283019
8086096,5,B000BF6UIA,"Interaction! Is what I love about this DVD. My daughter has been watching it for a few months, switching between Volume 1 & 2 and hasn't gotten bored of it.",1182816000,5,156,4.233333333333333
8086097,5,B000BF6UIA,"I have volume 1 also so I thought it would be nice to check out volume 2. Once again this is a wonderful video. I have a 2yr old and 9 month old twin boys and they all absolutely LOVE Horatio!! He makes everything so interesting and fun as well as educational. I highly reccommend this video. Horatio teaches lessons like eating, taking a bath, a nap, counting, ABC's, animals and more! Its just fantastic.",1176595200,8,406,4.426666666666667
8086098,5,B000BF6UIA,"My 19 month old son loves Horatio and it has become his favorite video!!  Horatio is cute and I feel like he is learning a lot from this video. My son watches the video, laughs, claps, jumps with the other kids, and just really enjoys it!

I highly recommend this video!",1153180800,10,270,4.2745098039215685
8086099,5,B000BF6UIA,"Wow, what can I say, my kids really love this video and adore the main character Horatio!

We have a 14 month old son and a 2 1/2 year old daughter and they both enjoy the video.

One thing that I think is great is how the kids interact with Horatio and the other kids on the screen.

Lots of topics are cover in this one, which is nice.

I definitely recommend the video!",1135814400,11,372,3.9864864864864864
8086100,5,B000BF6UIA,"My 1 year old and 2 1/2 year old love Horatio.  They can't seem to get enough of this video.

This video covers so many topics, it's very educational!

My kids also love watching the other kids in the video.

I highly recomend this video!",1133222400,11,238,4.222222222222222
