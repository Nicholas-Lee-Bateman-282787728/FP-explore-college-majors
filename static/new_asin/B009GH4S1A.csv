8541281,5,B009GH4S1A,The best African Rock Band ever! This is the one group that would and could create a riot just based on their performance. If you have not had the chance to see them live this is your only chance.,1416441600,,196,4.051282051282051
8541282,5,B009GH4S1A,i HAVE ENJOYED OSIBISA SINCE 1970 AND HAVE BEEN LOOKING FOR A DVD OF THEM PERFORMING.  THIS IS THE ONLY ONE I HAVE FOUND.  IT SOUNDS GOOD AND THE VIDEO IS O.K. BUT I WAS HOPING FOR MORE OF THEIR EARLIER RECORDINGS.  BUT AT LEAST THIS ONE EXISTS,1363305600,2,244,4.041666666666667
8541283,5,B009GH4S1A,"The only concert film That I have seen of Osibisa. It is worth it for that alone. I loved their first two albums and this concert is from their later more popular period after their commercial success of ""Welcome Home."" Makes no difference, the feel of their music is there. If you are a fan of Osibisa you need to see this.",1360368000,,324,4.241935483870968
