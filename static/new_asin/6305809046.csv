Now I'm not saying I don't hate an anime just because it has nudity in it, but the nudity in Photon is just show horribly done. It's very gross. Would you like to see a bunch of people under 18 in a show naked? I hope not. Anyways, the dubbing was a little stiff on Photon. Photon himself sounds very flat. There are some gags. Like when the main villan is naked, but he is covered by a dot. The gags eventually runs out of steam after the first minute. If you can bare the nudity (which you can't, I tried), this an ok show. I'd recommend you get use to watching shows like Those Who Hunt Elves and Ranma 1\2 before you see this. Then you'll be fine. Rent it first.",978393600,2,807,4.0186335403726705
7895553,4,6305809046,"First and foremost, this is not a children's video.  The correct rating is Anime'-18, indicating nudity, foul language and sexual situations.  However, the film does not take these concerns to such lengths as to ruin  its appeal to more mature general audiences.
Photon - The Idiot Menace is  played strictly for laughs, and it delivers.  The title character and hero  is a childlike, innocent boy who wants to do nothing more than fulfill his  promise to protect his friend Aun (stunningly reminiscent of the Angelica  character from RugRats), a starry-eyed adolescent with a one-track mind and  a propensity for getting into serious trouble.
In his quest to protect  Aun, poor little Photon finds himself battling badguys, in trouble with the  resident meanie, and accidentally married to a lovely named Keyne, who is  literally the ""key"" to the whole mess.
Photon - The Idiot  Menace accomplishes two very laudible feats:  first, it pokes good-natured  fun at the entire anime' genre, including giant robots, weapon-wielding  ninja types, and scantily clad (or unclad) beauties.  Second, it manages to  weave an effective romantic comedy with characters you actually begin to  care about.
Finally, in the tradition of all good cliffhangers, Photon  ends with the viewer wondering what's going to happen next.  In the words  of the immortal announcer: ""Tune in same time, same place, next week  for the next exciting adventure of. . . .""
Okay, so where's Volume  2?",964051200,2,1467,5.11864406779661
7895554,3,6305809046,"Oy vay! When I first saw the preview for this movie I thought it looked cool and kinda' was a spoof of Star Wars Ep. 1, but ,golly, so many naked people kinda goes past the PG rating,eh? Well, the plot was ok, and the  chicks(yes naked) were not that bad. BUT! when the evil man shed  all...........you can kinda' guess my reaction.",961286400,,332,4.253968253968254
7895555,5,6305809046,"Photon is a light hearted, fast paced, fun anime! Photon as a main character is an interesting choice, far more subdued than your average leading... boy.
Photon manages to hop into just about every anime  category; magic, mecha, comedy, kawaii, and even a lil romance. :)
You  can't help but love Photon, and you can't help but want to punch Aun in the  teeth =)
A must watch!",954633600,,376,4.5
