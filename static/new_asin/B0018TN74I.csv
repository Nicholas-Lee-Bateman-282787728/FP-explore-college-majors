3421232,2,B0018TN74I,"Martin Kane Private Eye came out in 1949 on TV by the Tabacco Company.
It encourages strongly to use their product in the program.
The United States Tobacco Company advertise smoking their tobacco all through the show of Martin Kane Private Eye.
I would not recommend this DVD usless you are thinking about taking up smoking.
If I had known that the Tabacco Company had put this show out, I would of not bought this Volume of 1-4 Martin Kane Private Eye.",1234915200,3,454,4.548780487804878
8271097,3,B0018TN74I,"As much as I enjoy Film Noir I can only give this set 3 stars. I don't have a problem with the video or sound quality considering the age of the programs. I expected to need the volume at full range and some fading of the images with the camera systems used early in television history.
It is disappointing there were so few of the episodes that were available to reproduce, especially the ones starring Lloyd Nolan whom I enjoyed the most as the detective.  The TV series ran for nearly six years, but there are only 16 episodes in the four volume set, which contains all of the episodes that apparently were reproducible. Actually there are really only 15 episodes in the set because one episode is duplicated in volumes 1 and 4 under different titles...""Hotel Con Game"" in Volume 1 and ""The Fortune Teller"" in Volume 4 are the same episode.
Beyond these discrepancies is the most annoying feature of the shows...Tobacco adds that are slipped in before, after and during the episodes worked in with the storyline. But, perhaps, the program may never have been produced without a mega company like American Tobacco sponsoring it.
The four volume set is the most economical way to buy the series if you are into old detective shows. If you don't mind the commercials or the duped episode it's worth the small investment.",1485216000,,1320,4.665236051502146

8271100,3,B0018TN74I,"Interesting plots, but very low budget work. Sometimes you catch the actors missing their lines and the film quality is low. Also, the episodes are heavily sprinkled with various tobacco ads and that can be a bit distracting at times, though that is the way the world was in the late 1940s and early 1950s.",1457395200,2,306,4.581818181818182

8271104,5,B0018TN74I,Martin Kane Private Eye - Vol 1-4 DVD set is what I expected and if you are a fan of the 50's PI TV shows this is made to order for you - FYI their sponser is a pipe tobacco company and their products are featured throughout the shows. I used to be a pipe smoker and it does not offend me - this is just FYI.,1346889600,7,308,3.611940298507463
8271105,5,B0018TN74I,"While it's true that Martin Kane was sponsored by the United States Tobacco Company, that is certainly no reason not to enjoy the show.  If you're going to avoid all '50s and '60s shows sponsored by tobacco companies, you'll not have much to watch. Matter of fact, I find the built-in tobacco commercials rather charming and campy. Regardless, this program has a few things going for it.  It was filmed live by NBC in film noir style, with that snappy gumshoe dialog we love and featured some of the best character actors of the day.  Despite the revolving door strategy of casting the title character (some episodes feature William Gargan, some Lloyd Nolan, others Lee Tracy) there is continuity in the person of Happy McMann, the pitch-man tobacconist, and some of the cops Kane associates with, including King Calder.  The transfers are a bit rough, as can be expected, but certainly viewable and entertaining.  Only six episodes of this series were originally available -- on a '50s detective compilation -- so it is heartening to find these 16 episodes collected in an affordable set.  Any fan of early TV drama will enjoy these episodes, despite (or because of) the scenes in Happy's smoke shop.",1313971200,22,1201,4.862745098039215
8271106,5,B0018TN74I,The dvds arrived quickly and were exactly as described.  I love these old TV shows -- remember watching them as a kid.,1259020800,7,118,4.363636363636363
