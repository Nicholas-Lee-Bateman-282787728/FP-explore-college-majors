7929471,3,B000051VQV,"Ok,ok, I know..... the acting overall is cardboard stiff, effects are near dime store quality, the story line mostly weak, so it should completly suck,right? But it doesn't. Overall the whole is greater than the sum of the parts for this budget flick, make some popcorn on a late Friday night and settle in for a good time. As you get into the movie you'll suddenly find yourself rooting for that little kid and the mega robot. Sadly the only DVD available is in German so we're stuck with VHS even in 2013, yuck. This flick kinda goes hand in hand with Crash and Burn, Robot Wars, & Robot Jox(a very slick looking movie, even on DVD!) all 4 feature mega robots, ya dig?",1358121600,,670,4.411290322580645
