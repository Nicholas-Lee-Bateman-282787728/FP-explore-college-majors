8065514,5,B0009RCPW0,"Having been very fond of the work of Steve and Terri Irwin, I've only recently discovered Jeff Corwin as another person who is passionate about wildlife.  I would definitely recommend this DVD for both children and adults who want to learn more about wildlife and care about preserving it for future generations.  This DVD offers three episodes from Borneo, Zanzibar and Indonesia.  You get to meet lots of interesting and endangered animals (turtles, snakes, insects, birds, primates, etc.).  The little baby turtles and orangutans are beyond adorable.  Jeff Corwin does a good job engaging his audience across all age groups.  Some of the information and humor maybe beyond preschoolers, but I couldn't find anything that was offensive or inappropriate.",1170979200,,755,5.302521008403361
8065515,3,B0009RCPW0,"My 5 year old loves Jeff Corwin, animal planet, and animals in general.  Unfortunatley, some of the language choices in this video are inappropriate for the little ones.",1135555200,,169,5.035714285714286
8065516,5,B0009RCPW0,"If you like nature shows, you should check out Jeff Corwin.  He is intelligent and a good teacher, and the boyish whit is a total bonus, in addition to the incredible and rare animals he features.  What sets Jeff apart from the other animal people is he isn't over the top and sounding like he's talking to kids (think Croc Hunter), but he is far from being bland or awkward in front of the camera like many of the other shows I've seen.  He's a charismatic natural in front of the camera.  I enjoyed this show with my husband before we had kids, but I couldn't wait to play this DVD with my 3 year old today to see what she'd think.  She was completely engrossed!  Some of humor admittely goes over her head, but when the kids are around age 6, they'll not only be interested in seeing all the wild animals, but they'll get the goofy jokes and will laugh as hard as me.

Buy this show!  You'll love it, trust me!

All ages-- 5 stars.  Enjoy!",1128729600,9,942,4.212290502793296
