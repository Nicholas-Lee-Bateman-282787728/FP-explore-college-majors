8411700,5,B00402FG9Y,"633 SQUADRON is quite British and a very entertaining World War II action adventure film that focuses both on the RAF pilots and their primary mission to obliterate a German rocket fuel plant located in occupied Norway. Starring Cliff Robertson as Wing Commander Roy Grant he leads an excellent cast that includes Harry Andrews as Air Vice Marshal Davis, Michael Goodliffe as Squadron Leader Frank Adams and George Chakiris as Lt. Erik Bergman. It also features Maria Perschy. Directed by Walter Grauman, this film features brilliant color cinematography by veteran Edward Scaife (KHARTOUM, THE DIRTY DOZEN, DARK OF THE SUN), another outstanding WWII score composed by Ron Goodwin (WHERE EAGLES DARE) and impressive special effects Tom Howard (WHERE EAGLES DARE). Cliff Robertson is a skillful, steadfast and always interesting actor who once again turns in an introspective performance underplaying a role that still commands the focal point of the viewer. It was good to see George Chakiris in another role aside from WESTSIDE STORY but his screen time and overall part seem a bit lacking in 633 SQUADRON. There is a lot of daring do and typical heroics in this film, but the integration of actual air footage by editor Bert Bates really make this film noteworthy. The air scenes in the narrow Norwegian fjord of the squadron under incredible anti-aircraft fire from the Nazi guns is truly exciting. Most effective for me was Ron Goodwin's uplifting and energetic score and main title he composed used throughout. This little gem of a film has been around for some time and it remains endearing to those of us who grew up with it. I highly recommend it.

BEACH RED is a very odd film. Believe it or not, the titles are very good, very innovative and then it does not deliver. Again the film suffers from poor production values. At the core, the unsettling script seems in conflict with the genre. It appears ti be an anti-war and anti-military film, yet this is not entirely for certain.  Rip Torn's performance as Sergeant Honeywell is one of the film's highlights.

BEACHHEAD directed by Stuart Heisler had potential and a good cast headed by Tony Curtis. The script by Richard Alan Simmons is interesting, but ultimately the production values really hurt this one. Frank Lovejoy and Skip Homeier give solid performances and the photography by Gordon Avil in Kauai makes up for the lack luster script.

Hugh O'Brian as Sgt. Steve Corey and Mickey Rooney as Sgt. Ernest Wartell make up for a lot in 1966's AMBUSH BAY directed by Ron Winston in this WWII set on a Japanese-held island in the Philippines. Nine Marines are on a special mission prior to General MacArthur re-taking the islands. There is a lot of guts and glory dialogue and Hugh O'Brian and Mickey Rooney have a lot of fun with it. AMBUSH BAY is a totally improbable film with another very weak script.

THE BRIDGE AT REMAGEN is a fairly good World War II adventure film full of action and suspense and an interesting script. George Segal and Ben Gazzara give standout performances and share a unique camaraderie on screen that enhances the overall effectiveness of the drama. Robert Vaughn's character is tragic in nature as he is simply a German officer trying to get his job done. It also features Bradford Dillman, E.G. Marshall and Bo Hopkins. There are some truly good combat sequences and a plot, which is quite captivating. It contains a good score composed by Elmer Bernstein with a little more drive and more modernistic, which is less intellectual than his GREAT ESCAPE score. Yet, it is very effective in this film. John Guillermin neatly directed it for maximum entertainment value. I am not sure how historically accurate this film is, but it will keep you glued to your seat for shear excitement.

1969's MOSQUITO SQUADRON is a Great WWII RAF film directed by Boris Sagal. David McCallum (THE GREAT ESCAPE) plays RAF Squadron Leader Quint Munroe who wrestles with the loss in action of his best friend Scotty, played by David Buck, who has been shot down. The cast includes Charles Gray (NIGHT OF THE GENERALS), Suzanne Neve, Bryan Marshall, Vladek Sheybal (FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE) and Robert Urquhart. Frank Cordell (KHARTOUM) composed a truly majestic score for MOSQUITO SQUADRON elevating beyond the standard WWII film. The effective cinematography was by Paul Beeson (DUNKIRK, ATTACK ON THE IRON COAST, SUBMARINE X-1). At the heart of the film is the Royal Air Force's attacks on German V-1 installations during the summer of 1944. On a flight reconnaissance mission over the Chateau de Charlon in Northern France, it is revealed that the next phase of V-1 rockets are being developed. Air Commodore Hufford played by an overly enthusiastic Charles Gray orders an attack on the Chateau using a ""bouncing bomb"" similar to that developed by Barnes Wallis similar to that seen in THE DAM BUSTERS. What complicates this mission is that Allied prisoners are held as ""human shields"" by the Nazis.",1421712000,2,4975,4.923718712753278

8411704,3,B00402FG9Y,"These were not the best movies that came out on World War II. The color is good, and they have some good scenes in each movie. Beach Red was not one I liked when it came out, and I did not like it again. Never understood what the director was trying to do. Did not work for me. Rest are B movies. Not a bad price though.",1319587200,,320,3.791044776119403
8411705,3,B00402FG9Y,"My biggest complaint about this compilation is the mastering/transfer of the films.
The Movies in this pack that are Widescreen are Widescreen in Full screen format (except for 633 Squadron).

Let me clarify that.
The Movies that are in WS format are still in WS format, but instead of automatically going to WS mode on your TV they go to Full Screen mode - thus you have Black (blank) on the top, bottom, and both sides.
To get the full WS mode as it should be to fill your screen you have to zoom the picture, which of course loses a fair amount of detail and doesn't look as good as it should.

633 Squadron is the only WS in this pack that does it correctly.

As for the Movies in this pack:
The Bridge at Remagen is the best of the bunch, this is a good one.
Beach Red is just kind of odd, not really like any other War Movie out there, and it's not terribly good either.
Beachhead has Tony Curtis and is an okay flick, though not stellar.
Ambush Bay with Mickey Rooney (yes Mickey Rooney), is fair, but . . . well, it's a bit difficult for me to take M.R. as a tough Sgt. in War Movie - this is just not his genre.

Mosquito Squadron / 633 Squadron - I grouped these two together because they are almost interchangeable.
In fact, there are several scenes that are absolutely the exact same film footage frame for frame in both pictures.

I would actually give this two and a half stars.
The first Movie and the number of Movies for the price are the saving points for this package.",1319414400,4,1487,4.221830985915493
8411706,4,B00402FG9Y,"The 6 movies here are as stated by amazon,and not by the previous reviewer. I've watched
4 of the 6,and 3 of these are good to very good. These are the Bridge at Remagen,
Beachhead and Mosquito Squadron. I didn't think too much of Ambush Bay,which
seemed to have no story line-other than killing off the group one at a time-until
nearly the very end. If you like WW II movies,this is a good collection at a very
good price.",1306800000,,423,4.3
