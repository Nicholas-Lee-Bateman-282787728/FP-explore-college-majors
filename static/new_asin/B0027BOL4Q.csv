3864049,5,B0027BOL4Q,"Everyone's sex life is their own; it's no one's business what we do in our bedrooms, UNTIL some individuals (as our politicians do) decide to exercise their moral authority as though it was given to them by God.

It is disturbing to see how the people who lead our nation display duplicity every day. What good can we expect of people who can't be true to themselves?

It is very important to understand that this documentary does not present a compelling position for or against homosexuality. This documentary simply reveals the cheap games some politicians are playing to deceive their family and their people, while hiding the reality of their lives.

The saddest part for me was seeing the exwife of James McGreevy , the previous governor of New Jersey, who found out that her husband of many years and the father of her daughter was gay all along. How can we believe, as a nation, that somebody who can engage in such a selfish deception with his own family can work for the best interest of his nation?

It is time for people to stop following empty slogans and self appointed saints, it is time to think and this documentary will help!",1259020800,17,1143,4.615763546798029
3864050,5,B0027BOL4Q,"I saw this on October 30, 2009 and I must say, I was shocked and a lot of ""why"" questions were answered as I watched this documentary.  The gay and lesbian community has been holding Americans hostage with the power they weild in D.C and we should all be OUTRAGED.  I have always supported the gay and lesbian community being free to live life with the benefits of straight couples.  The problem is this group wants only one standard, theirs.  By that I mean; when same sex marriage won in California, and while the challenge was going through the courts, the marriage license in California went from ""bride and groom"" to ""party A and party B"", no choice, only ""non-gender specific"".  A right was taken away from the majority population.  Outrage answers why choice is not an option.  The Prop 8 campaign was in full swing and the gay and lesbian supporters claimed same sex marriage had nothing to do with K-12 education.  But, San Diego saw a threatened lawsuit, with demands, after Prop 8, in the public school system regarding a parents right to approve their childs presence at a gay and lesbian report done by a student.  The gay/lesbian parents were upset the school sent home a permission slip for students to be present at their childs presentation on a gay/lesbian activist.  After Prop 8 passed one of the California school districts submitted a ""gay and lesbian"" curriculum in an elementary school.  By my account That is bringing gay and lesbian sex education and life style/culture into the K-12 curriculium???  Anyway, ""Outrage"" explains that many members of the gay and lesbian community hold powerful positions as elected officials, some known as gay or lesbian and some still in the closet and going to great lengths to keep it in the closet.  Point is laws have been passed to prevent prayer in public schools, at one time there was a program called religous release in Southern California schools, and parents signed permission slips for their children to attend the last hour, of the day, one day a week in a bible study of their religous preference.  The fight between the gay and lesbian community with religion is well documented and with the power this group has in D.C., not just elected officials passing legislation, but gay and lesbian lobbyist and D.C. media use and hide information about lawmakers at the head of powerful committies responsible for the upside down policy making in D.C..  Outrage explains many ""why"" questions regarding the upside down decisions coming out of our nations capitol.  The majority of Americans do not know the person they are voting for and are, blindly, voting along party lines and voting for the candidate with the most money. This documentary is a must see before the upcoming elections.",1257552000,4,2754,4.840085287846482
3864051,5,B0027BOL4Q,"It has been said; ""All that is necessary for the triumph of evil is that good men do nothing"".  Even worse, is when good men lie about who they are and work for the opposition!

Unfortunately it is unpopular in many circles to be homosexual.  I understand that you may want to hide to further your career or your political agenda.  But to actively work against yourself and your rights is masochistic.  If nothing else, I think the movie Outrage will educate all of us as to how self-hatred is belittling to the individual and harmful to society at large.

3864052,5,B0027BOL4Q,"Apparently the previous reviewer didn't actually SEE the film which I do believe is a prerequisite to a good review. This film is an eye-opener, an in depth examination of the extent that closeted gay politicians (and there are many) will go to protect themselves. This protection takes the form of  the most vehement method of defense, reaction-formation. The primary point of the film is to question the practice of outing closeted gay politicians who promote and protect their own careers at the expense of the rights of others. Larry Craig is seen as a rather pathetic figure who's accusations of gay encounters go as far back as the 1980's, long before his last bathroom fiasco. Also interviewed are politicians who have come out of the closet (or been forced out) explaining the freedom attained through honesty. Most interesting is information surrounding the current governor of Florida. The film is riveting from beginning to end. Illustrations of a Freudian slip by a Fox news reporter provide a moment of laughter, while  the censoring of an Anderson Cooper (of all people) Bill Maher interview which omits Maher's naming of a gay politician gives question to the beltways conspiracy to protect right-wing gay politicians and their staff. You will be amazed and surprised at the disclosures this film has to offer! A must see. Watch for the Republican conservative who takes his gay ""right hand man"" all over the world for extended travel but makes sure their arrival is always one day apart.",1244505600,53,1503,4.98406374501992
3864053,1,B0027BOL4Q,"(Seen in  Tucson, June 7 2009)
Mildly entertaining..
Totally ignores the opinion of most Americans that - erm - marriage is a union of 1 man and 1 woman (see vote in Calif.) Most people have no objection to spreading medical benefits to partners, and your pet parrot if your state can afford it, to hospital visits, adoption etc..
  But the institution of marriage has been around several thousand years with good reason. It corresponds to special and favorable treatment for parents (or adopters). If we expand this, like several loony states have done, where do we stop?  How about threesies, anyone?
Give us a break. This movie, like Michael Moore's, is a one-sided polemic. Yes, some pols. are hypocrites. Yes, Bush II used this topic-- why not? It floats.",1244419200,10,760,4.823076923076923

3864069,5,B0027BOL4Q,"Human beings belong to the only species that kills for personal gain, power, political advantage or for the sheer, morbid pleasure of it. And, homophobic closeted queer politicians in the corridors of power have been (and still are) doing just that - systematically voting against legislation and initiatives that would otherwise protect or enhance the rights of the LGBT community. This incisive, in-your-face expose bares all and recounts how the courage of leading LGBT activists have ""outed"" quite a number of hypocritical, politically ambitious individuals who were living a lie in loveless marriages and, at the same time, engaging in wanton, albeit surreptitious, homosexual liaisons. The ""outing"" was not about the fact that those individuals were closeted queers - it was necessary for LGBT activists to expose the deception and lies as well as the premeditated collaboration of those closeted queers in power with the right-wing fundamentalist Christian coalition to systematically suppress LGBT rights.

Bravo to our intrepid LGBT activists who've made a big difference to the community by exposing this vicious and insidious charade on Capitol Hill.",1347148800,3,1161,5.522471910112359

I highly recomend this DVD.",1346889600,2,357,4.546875
3864071,5,B0027BOL4Q,"""Outrage"" is an excellent documentary that attacks the hypocrisy of elected officials in Washington, D.C. (often male Republicans but sometimes Democrat) who are members of the LGBTQ community but hide that from the public for the sake of their careers and their inability to come to terms with the fact that they are gay, lesbian, bisexual or anything other than heterosexual. It's incredible to watch the lengths some people have gone to hurt their peers in the LGBTQ community by introducing and/or supporting laws that deny or take away gay rights that shouldn't even be questioned like gay adoption and gay marriage. All throughout the film there are stories of hypocritical elected officials lashing out at the LGBTQ public while desperately clinging on to a fake ""heterosexual"" marriage. It amazes me that their ""spouses"" actually put up with so much garbage although admittedly some may be in denial.

One closeted hypocrite in this film is former Senator Larry Craig who sought out sexual encounters with men in bathrooms; one man states he had a one-night stand with Craig at Craig's house but Craig warned he would ruin him if he told anyone. Yet ""Craig supported the Federal Marriage Amendment, which barred extension of rights to same-sex couples."" How awful! The film also tells it like it is with a spotlight on Mary Cheney's refusal to help her own LGBTQ community; she could have influenced her father (then Vice President Dick Cheney) to help and not harm the community--Mary stood silently by while President Bush terrified people by pushing for a constitutional amendment to define marriage as a union that can only be between a man and a woman!

We also get interview time with former New Jersey Governor Jim McGreevey. McGreevey had the strength to come out, but he came out after wrecking the lives of others. When Jim McGreevey admitted he had an affair with another man, he told his wife and family he had been gay all along and in denial. McGreevey also promptly resigned from office; naturally we just can't have a gay Governor! In addition, former Florida Governor Charlie Crist and former New York City Mayor Ed Koch are revealed to be closeted gay hypocrites and we even learn that D.C. has many gay people working there although a lot of them hide in the closet with wives as if they were living in arranged marriages.

Look also for fascinating interview footage with some very brave gay men including Larry Kramer, Michelangelo Signorile and Michael Rogers who has outed closeted gay politicians publicly opposing gay rights.

There's much more I can write but I'll leave the rest out so as not to spoil it all for you! The bonus features include deleted scenes and an optional commentary by writer/director Kirby Dick and producer Amy Ziering.

""Outrage"" is mandatory viewing for anyone in the LGBTQ community and those of us who appreciate political documentaries. People studying politics in general would do well to get this film for their collections.",1342137600,4,2989,4.946215139442231

3864073,1,B0027BOL4Q,"In a day and age where a mother of 3 would be shot for her own protection, they make a title called outrage and make it about gays in politics.

The outrage isn't about ""obey or die"", it's about gays. For a mother of 3 to continue her life after riding a moped without a helmet, she'd have to ignore a cops signal to stop. Then she'd have to respond to the violence initiated against here when she arrived home. Then she'd have to respond to the guns pulled on her after she resisted the pepper spray and tasers. Then she would be gunned down and the cops would call it ""self defense"" and ""helmet laws are for your protection.""

The outrage in this film isn't over our complete lack of freedom when it comes to anything less trivial than how many times we blink in a minute, it's about gays in politics.

I didn't bother to watch the rest of the film after I saw where it was going.

With all that's going on, we don't need to hear about gays or Snookie. If you make something about this, title and describe it that way so we don't waste our time.",1330732800,5,1047,4.1683168316831685

3864076,5,B0027BOL4Q,"the Closeted Conservative is alive and well in Washington DC apparently, keeping alive the grand old tradition of Roy Cohn and J Edgar Hoover.

This documentary DVD 'Outrage' makes the interesting point that Washington DC is probably more gay than San Francisco, especially so if you count all the closeted conservatives like Mitch McConnell, Larry Craig, Eric Cantor, Lyndsey Graham, Karl Rove and on and on and on.

What is it about politics and closeted conservatives? It must have a primal attraction just like Broadway for the uncloseted, it's just another form of theater where you get to be as vicious and backstabbing as you want while raking in the lobbyist cash and partying all night after screwing the opposition during the day. And the closeted Rush Limbaugh has given them all a free ride to get in office with his poisonous brainwashing of the low-information electorate.",1319155200,5,886,5.020408163265306
3864077,5,B0027BOL4Q,"This documentary is genuinely outstanding.  It neither take sides nor casts judgements, but rather merely examines the tragic results of self-hate projected outward.  It transformed me from feeling pure anger at the subjects and their ugly hypocrisies prior to my viewing, to merely feeling honestly sorry for their empty and pathetic lives afterward.  Sunlight really is the best disinfectant, and this beautiful film casts a clear light of understanding on a confusing psychological mechanism.  Our children will look back on today in bewilderment, which is both pathetic and hopeful, but this film will stand as a fantastic explanation of how closeted self-hate of any kind manifests itself, particularly in politics.",1309737600,4,720,5.5181818181818185
3864078,5,B0027BOL4Q,"Full disclosure:  I have been friends with one of the interviewees in this documentary for many years. I know the back story of his decision to out the politician of whom he speaks.  As this excellent film makes clear, such decisions are not to be taken lightly.

For me the central theme of the documentary is not that there are closeted or hypocritical politicians in Washington--nor am I surprised at how ""gay"" D.C. is. I think that the core of this expose is the moral question of outing itself.

Outrage brings to light several questions and leans toward certain conclusions. But the presentation also encourages the audience to think for ourselves.  Outing is not something that I support in every circumstance. For example I would draw distinctions between private figures, public figures, and public officials.

This film spotlights elected individuals who run on platforms with moral planks. Therefore I support one of the key premises of Outrage: it IS legitimate to ask elected officials how they comport themselves when they are off the clock. Pointing out glaring inconsistencies between their rhetoric and their behavior is simply another way of saying that we voters value honesty.",1278115200,3,1196,5.107692307692307
3864079,5,B0027BOL4Q,"Kirby Dick (""This Film Is Not Yet Rated"") in ""Outrage"" has produced a film that every gay and lesbian in this country should see and take to heart. And it should be required viewing by the main stream media as well. Mr. Dick's purpose was to make a film showing the hypocrisy of closeted gay people in positions of power-- congressmen, mayors, governors, et.-- who introduce and pass laws harmful to gay people. It is his belief and the activists he interviews-- Larry Karmer, Andrew Sullivan, Michelangelo Signorile, Rodger McFarlane, of course Michael Rogers et al.-- that these reprehensible people should be thrown out of their closets sooner rather than later.

Mr. Dick names names: this extremely-well documented documentary begins with the pathetic story of Larry Craig, the Republican Senator from Idaho who was busted in a men's room: ""I am not gay."" Others on the wall of infamy: Ed Koch, Charlie Crist, David Dreier, Jim MCCrery. Mary Cheney, the former employee of Coors Beer, makes the list too although she is not in the closet. She gets highlighted because she could have done something for the rights of gay people since she is the daughter of the ex-vice president but chose not to do so.

There are few heroes here. It is difficult to get much excited about Jim Kolbe who outed himself before someone else did or Jim McGreevey for that matter, or two former Log Cabin Republicans who offer commentary. Mr. Dick said when asked about why he used these two men in the film, is that they knew of many closeted Republicans who work for many elected officials in Washington. My favorite quotation is this really stomach-turning film: ""You can't swing a cat without hitting a gay staffer in Washington."" A close second would be what Larry Kramer said when Ed Koch, who lived in the same apartment building with him and McFarlane, knelt down to pat Kramer's dog at the apartment mailboxes. He grabs up the dog and says: ""That's the man who killed all of Daddy's friends.""

There are other features included with this DVD: deleted scenes (one in which Michael Rogers goes to the Creation Museum in Northern Kentucky), a moving tribute to Rodger McFarlane, a panel discussion with Larry Kramer, McFarlane, Dick and Michelangelo and  Sigorile, and Dick taking Q's and A's from an audience.

Powerful, depressing, outrageous, ""Outrage"" deserves to be seen and acted on. The good guys in the film remind all of us-- and show footage from a speech by Harvey Milk years ago where he said the same thing-- that gays and lesbians all over the U. S. should come out now. That includes closeted politicians",1275264000,5,2607,4.810267857142857
3864080,4,B0027BOL4Q,"""Outrage"" is told from the point of view of gays who want to see certain closeted gays in government outed--those underground gays who consistently vote for or advocate anti-gay agendas and consistently oppose spending for Aids research. Some of the gay Congressmen outed have voting records that are almost one hundred per cent anti-gay rights. Some closeted politicians are hypocrites who often needlessly take homophobic stands. One theory expounded in the documentary: their anti-gay stances may be based on self-loathing.
 The film uses commentary by openly gay Congressman Barney Frank who was himself outed years ago. Gay activist Larry Kramer appears. There's a great deal about and commentary by former New Jersey governor James McGreevey who outed himself at a famous news conference with his wife standing by his side. The film starts with the arrest of Senator Larry Craig of Idaho after the famous men's room foot tapping incident.
 There is a section of the film on the culture wars, on gay marriage and the efforts to ban it. A good quote: ""The closet suffocates the integrity of decent people."" The movie calls for honesty and truthfulness. One commentator says that politicians are so used to positioning themselves and spinning, that closeted ones become skilled at deflecting accusations of being gay.
 The documentary names names, but some of the ""evidence"" presented in the film is suspect and flimsy at best. The movie, for example, ""outs"" former New York City mayor Ed Koch. He did very little about the devastating epidemic of HIV/Aids when he was mayor of a city where the epidemic had deadly consequences. But a man who claimed to be a former sexual partner of Koch never officially went on the record substantiating the claim that the former mayor was gay. The same kind of flimsy evidence shows up when the film is talking about Florida governor Charlie Crist. Some of the cases in the film are largely built on hearsay.
 It's an interesting and enlightening documentary, worth seeing, and the crusaders for outing make a persuasive case for the practice. Hypocrisy should be challenged.",1266364800,4,2115,5.068965517241379
3864081,5,B0027BOL4Q,"In the home where I grew up, sexuality was a topic of discussion as often as African coltan mining.  Thus, looking back at the gays and lesbians I knew when I was a kid, I didn't notice the obvious signs such as clumsy public displays of heterosexuality.  I remember one homosexual boy looking through a PLAYBOY magazine he had taken to our high school, hooting at images of naked women and saying to the guys, ""If you don't like these pictures, something's wrong with you.""

No, Larry Craig was not my classmate.  But unlike former Senator Craig, I have not heard of that gay childhood friend who took PLAYBOY to school growing up to be a homosexual-bashing politician, the topic of the documentary OUT RAGE.  The film overviews some of the most high-profile elected officials who publicly work against equal rights for gays while privately dating those of their own gender and features a gay rights activist who outs them.  However, what made me think of that PLAYBOY-touting boy was OUT RAGE's interviews with outed individuals such as former New Jersey governor Jim McGreevey, who recalls his ""See how straight I am?"" motions such as going to strip clubs.  While the former Garden State governor hurt his two wives by keeping his gay lifestyle a secret, to Jim McGreevey's credit he did not use homosexuality for political purposes.

To my surprise, OUT RAGE does not mention the 200-plus White House visits (February 2003 - February 2007) of Jeff Gannon, the homosexual male prostitute/Republican stooge reporter hired by the George W. Bush administration, where actions against gay marriage were a cornerstone of its divisive policies.  Mr. Gannon (real name: James Guckert) entered the Bush White House no fewer than 32 times either when there were no press briefings or returning later to the presidential mansion after a briefing. Did he have a third gig, delivering pizza?

But even without reporting on the gay-bashing Bush White House's regular visits from a male prostitute, to find more two-faced closeted politicians than the number this documentary exposes you'd need to attend a Judy Garland fan club convention.  See OUT RAGE.",1265673600,5,2144,4.99438202247191

8354462,5,B0027BOL4Q,"Politicians are, or should be, duty bound to represent their constituents.  I would imagine that, in nearly every case, there is at least one queer constituent looking for equal rights and protection under the Constitution.  But many elected representatives don't care or fight hatefully against it, using rhetoric whose only purpose it is to further alienate their queer constituents or even incite other citizens to do violence to them.  But what if the elected representative has engaged in same-sex behavior themselves and swept it under the rug?  Should they be outed?  That's what this documentary explores.  The act of ""outing"" is quite controversial since it can be so destructive but, in the instance of Larry Craig, a former Republican Senator from Idaho, for example, with a solidly anti-queer voting record, making public his sexuality seems less important than exposing him for the cheap hypocrite he is.  This hypocrisy justifies the actions taken.  To hear these representatives cook up convoluted reasons they were caught, well, with their pants down is so appalling but so fascinating.  This documentary astutely handles the issues and the people involved with them, gaining further insight by interviewing outed politicians and those who have always been openly gay.  There's a great amount of power to be had in politics - obviously.  But people remember Walt Whitman today as a masterful poet who was authentic even when it caused him harm.  We do not tend to remember those in power at the time who made his life miserable.  Closeted bigots in power are a horror wherever they are but when they are finally exposed - even after death like Strom Thurmond and his secret mixed race daughter - they only invite revulsion.",1494892800,,1739,5.080985915492958

And even now its so safe in some countries but still a death sentence in others.  Straight thinkers still think they have the right to decide if its ok to be queer or not.  Maybe I need to make my own movie about this because it will always be about truth of who I am and nothing to do with choice.  You can choose to be out or not,  not  queer or not.
Maybe too American in its views, I was disappointed but come from a country where we were the first in the world to let women vote.
