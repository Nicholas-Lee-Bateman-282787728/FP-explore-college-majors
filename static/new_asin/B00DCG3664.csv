5788993,5,B00DCG3664,"I am a child of the 80s, and Jim Henson's The Christmas Toy is a must-see during the holidays.  I found out that a few years after The Christmas Toy was released, this spin-off series, Secret Life of Toys, was created in Germany and released in Europe and in the US.  I never saw this series as we didn't have cable when I was a child.  When this popped up on Amazon, I had to order it.  The premise is still the same: the toys come alive after the people leave the room.  The toys get up to shenanigans but always seem to learn a valuable lesson in the end.  The toy room is different as are some of the characters and voices.  I was glad to see that Rugby the Tiger is the same through and through.  This DVD includes 6 episodes and is labelled ""Volume 1"" so I assume there are more volumes to follow.  I introduced my three-year-old son to the Christmas Toy movie which he thoroughly enjoys.  I think all the catchy songs help.  As expected, he loves this series too.  Well worth the small amount I paid for the DVD.  I would recommend it!",1380844800,10,1042,4.175879396984925
