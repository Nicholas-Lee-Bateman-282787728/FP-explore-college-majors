I am now, also, doing the Pilates, ""Body Victory"" DVDs.  Thank you, Marilu!  You've created a workout that is fun and challenging, but easy to follow!",1404604800,,294,4.596153846153846

7826510,1,6302492068,Marilu did not think about the people with two left feet. She goes really fast during the dance steps. I could not even do half of the workout when I did it for the first time. She does not realize that not everyone could do the dances that she does in the video,973123200,2,262,3.9622641509433962
