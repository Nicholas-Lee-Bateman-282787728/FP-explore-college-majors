8238391,5,B0010S9CHS,I really enjoyed this vampire film that's also a dark comedy. The cast is a who's who of actors that was fun to see all together in one film. There are a lot of gags with some really cool action sequences and special effects. It's also fun to see with a bunch of friends!,1399680000,,271,4.037037037037037
8238392,1,B0010S9CHS,Very disappointing.  DVD arrived damaged and crushed and has scratches and gashes so didn't want to risk sticking it in my tv that has a Blu-ray/DVD player.,1393027200,,156,4.777777777777778
