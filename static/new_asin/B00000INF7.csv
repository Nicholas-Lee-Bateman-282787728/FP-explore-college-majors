1224349,5,B00000INF7,First saw this on TV then purchased on here to watch again. It's  a great document of a point in time that changed not only Brets life but changed the WWF too.

1224351,5,B00000INF7,"This is the classic Bret Hart Wrestling with Shadows documentary 15th anniversary edition, wow has really been that long already! The documentary focuses on the events of summer 1997 when Bret was in negotiations with WCW and eventually decided to join them. The documentary covers Brets exit from WWF, as initially agreed and how it actually pans out climaxing with the now infamous Montreal Screwjob.

This is a great behind the scenes look at WWE at the time, what happens in the lead up to a big PPV on the day at the arena with insightful interviews with  Bret and his wife Julie giving their thoughts on events. Great viewing and definitely the best pro wrestling documentary out there!

The extras also include a making of the documentary feature and an interview with Paul Jay.

Disk 2 of the 2 disk special edition is a documentary called the Life and Times of Owen Hart. This covers the period following Owens death and has interviews with
family members including a very scathing Martha Hart!",1415059200,,1003,4.780346820809249

1224380,5,B00000INF7,"About 15 years ago one of the most infamous incidents in pro-wrestling history took place, where WWE Champion Bret Hart was involved in a screwjob devised by WWE Chairman Vince McMahon and superstar Shawn Michaels. This incident sent shockwaves through wrestling and caused a major rift between all three men, the story has been told before but this dvd gives us a behind the scenes look at Bret's final few months in the WWE up to the day in Montreal, Canada where this screwjob happened.

This documentary is quite well done, the interview pieces and behind the curtain look really does lend some realism to the personal feelings everyone involved felt leading up to the day in Montreal. Bret seems very honest and real when he talks about his career and how he views himself, I personally loved hearing from Bret, seeing all the backstage footage of the various wrestlers including the members of the Hart Foundation stable, Brian Pillman, Jim Neidhart, British Bulldog and Bret's late brother Owen Hart.

Its actually well filmed, very well paced, you really get a feel from all those involved, especially Bret, who had his own reasons for wanting to do the match in Montreal his way. Its just too bad things couldn't be worked out between Vince and Bret, which lead to so much animosity that they didn't talk for years. Mind you of course in the past years things have been patched up between Bret, Vince and even Bret and Shawn.

This is a great look at what was and still is a very important moment in wrestling history, a wonderful look at the personal lives of Bret and his family and if you're a wrestling fan you will enjoy this documentary as it does tear down the walls of the WWE at that time.

Also included is a special dvd about the death of Owen Hart, where Bret talks about his brother's life and how his death has affected the family and Bret personally. Its a good special feature for sure.",1344902400,,1911,4.6117647058823525

1224382,5,B00000INF7,"I am a 26 year old male, and grew up during the Monday Night Wars era of professional wrestling. I was always a WWF/E fan with the likes of Razor Ramon, Shawn Michaels, Bret Hart, Crush, Undertaker, and a few more being my favorite wrestlers at the time. Speaking specifically about my love for The Hitman, I was always confused as to why my ""hero"" started to ""hate"" Americans, and started a strong effort to gain some heat and become a heel. I always wondered why there was so much bitterness in his character, and why he eventually left the company.

I didn't order the now-famous Montreal Survivor Series ... I was young at the time and just couldn't afford PPV's, and my parents weren't really a fan of me watching wrestling. We started to approach the Attitude era, and started to see far more sex and violence on the weekly shows, so spending money on a PPV was out of the question for me at the time. I was excited to see two of my favorite wrestlers duke it out in the Hitman's home-country. I was hoping this would be the end-all match for this rivalry that has turned to a disgusting display that amplified the true feelings of the people behind the characters of The Hitman and The Heartbreak Kid.....sadly I was right.

This video takes you behind the scenes as Bret Hart intends to document his time in the WWE. You get to meet a lot of your favorite characters behind the scenes, and get a taste of what is going on behind closed doors. Watching Bret at the start of the video really makes you realize how much of a true wrestling fan he is, and how he sacrificed everything for the business. The video documents the struggles of Vince McMahon during a time where WCW was gaining far better ratings, and revenue was at an all time low. You also get to see exactly how the backstage politics play out, who the shot-callers are, and how the business is played to cater towards revenue.

The saddest part of the video is watching the Montreal Screwjob unfold. For many of us who knew what happened, watching this DVD almost makes you want to say ""don't go out there Bret, don't""..the suspense that fills up watching him enter that ring, knowing what is about to come. The plot unfolds, and the documentary takes you through the emotions associated with the 'job, watching Bret as he starts smashing monitors, and signing 'W' 'C' 'W' with his fingers to the crowd ... you knew that this was the biggest backstabbing in recent memory in sports entertainment.

Taking you backstage, the documentary shows you just a little bit of what happens in the locker room when all was said and done. The first backstage confrontation with Shawn Michaels, the questions to HHH on if hew knew about the 'job, and the first confrontation with Mr. McMahon which led to a rolled ankle and a knockout punch.

The documentary then takes you to Bret's journey to the rival company, the WCW. You can see exactly how the politics change, and how the stories are differently developed between the companies. Unfortunately, you also start to realize that this is the start of the demise of the Hitman character.

If you only watch one WWF/E documentary in your life, this is the one that you need to watch. It takes you away from keyfabe, and behind the scenes. You will live Bret's story, and feel his pains, and wish that you could go back in time only to pray it plays out differently.",1328486400,,3374,4.522950819672131

1224384,5,B00000INF7,"Hitman was always one of my favorite wrestlers and after seeing this I appreciate him even more. It is interesting to get a behind the scenes look at the WWF and this documentary delivers. The WWF was at its best in the mid 80's to the Mid 90's and it will never be what it was again. It was always so evident that Vince McMahon systematically destroyed the WWF in the 90's and this DVD shows how it happened. Vince also destroyed the Hitman, which would have been plain to see for any wrestling fan, but it was interesting to see how it happened behind the scenes. Geez, Vince McMahon is such a totally unlikable person.",1324080000,,621,4.362068965517241
1224385,5,B00000INF7,"This two pack had been on my list since I first read about its release. I had watched like many and VHS recorded the original airing of Wrestling With Shadows on A & E when it was doubled up with the Hulk Hogan biography. This was a highly anticipated film which was done with respect and great quality to both Bret Hart and WWE. At the time Vince McMahon didn't want the world to know what the inside story was on Bret getting out of WWE to go to WCW at that time. This documentary serves as a snip-it of one of many situations a wrestler goes through when working for a major organization. It's more than the physical product you see every week. There's the mental preparation, sometimes the walk through of a match/angle, and then like in any other line of work there's contract negotiation issues. This also tells the story of Bret Hart, which is complimented some 10 years later by the WWE released anthology of Bret Hart and the book titled Hitman: My Life In The Cartoon World of Wrestling. It will also be revisited in the soon to be released title by WWE outlining the Montreal incident.

The DVD on Owen Hart wasn't as lengthy as Bret's Wrestling with Shadows. But it gave a fair look into who Owen Hart was with insight from various people within his life. Owen's DVD focuses mostly on his tragic accident from 1999 that costed him his life, and forced his family to be without a father. Both DVDs in this pack are a great watch for anyone who's ever wanted to know about this side of professional wrestling.",1313971200,,1519,4.425
1224386,5,B00000INF7,"I had already watched the wrestling with shadows in its entirety on A & E when it aired back in 1998
so I knew what to expect I say its a must see for any wrestling fan whether your a fan of the Harts or not.
Basically this dvd shows Bret hart in his last days with then wwf before he signed with wcw. His feud with HBK Shawn Michaels is legendary, but somewhere down the line between Shawn ""loosing his smile"" and quitting wwf before ever losing to Bret and Vince McMahon wanting to keep Bret and give the keys to Shawn, leads to the biggest screwjob in wrestling history the infamous ""Montreal Screwjob"".

This Dvd includes a special Life and Death of Bret Hart's younger Brother Owen Hart, and a Stunt that went horribly wrong on a sad Sunday night in Kansas.
Owen is one of the best in ring performers of our time and this short tribute will support my claim.
included are interviews with Bret and widow of Owen also the films creator.

Hall of Fame for the King OF Harts wwe its the least you could do for a man who gave his all.

1224387,4,B00000INF7,"Wow, I remember watching this when it first came on I think A&E back in like 1998. As a matter of fact, I still have it recorded on VHS tape. This was the doc that really blew the door open on the reality of the wrestling business for me. A very interesting documentary, I would recommend this to old wrestling fans as a good look into the inner workings and behind the scenes dealings of a top performer and top promoter in the business. For newer fans this would be a nice first look into the inside. I feel really old going back now almost a decade and a half later and seeing where we have gone. Before, WCW died, before HBK retired, returned, and retired again, before Bret Hart was forced out by injury, before Triple H was part of the upper management of WWE, there was Wrestling With Shadows. Things really have changed.",1313020800,,828,4.348387096774194

I give it 5 stars because it pretty much shows the truth about the battle with Vince McMahon and Bret Hart.
The Owen Hart DVD was great! It was sad when his wife started talking about the last time she saw/talked to him.
But Yeah it talked about the life of the Harts and much more!
I really recommend getting this DVD for any wrestling fan!",1305763200,,397,4.1688311688311686
1224419,4,B00000INF7,"Bret ""Hitman"" Hart has made his mark as a pro wrestler. Building on his father's success in the ring, Bret became one of the most-recognizable faces during the 1990s wrestling boom. Wrestling in the Shadows is a documentary that follows Hart during his split from Vince McMahon's WWF for a rival league.

There is a lot to like in this documentary. Hart discusses what it was like to have a father who was a pro wrestler. By Bret's reckoning, it was mostly negative, as it led to much abuse from other children. Also, the viewer learns about Bret's life with his wife and kids and about the difficulties of life on the road.

However, the main focus is on Hart's deteriorating relationship with Vince McMahon. Hart admits that McMahon's help was essential to his success in wrestling, but Hart fears that McMahon will take away Hart's championship belt before he leaves. The drama builds as the documentary nears its end.

My only complaint with the film is that we don't know how much of the action is scripted. Given that Hart eventually returned to work for McMahon, I believe that much of what happens in the film is staged.

Still, I enjoyed the film held my interest. For wrestling fans, this film is worth watching.",1305158400,,1222,4.669767441860465
1224420,5,B00000INF7,"When Sid was just a young little elf, there was no better way to start your Saturday morning then with a nice dose of WWF. Of course we were like 8 and not 27 at the time, so watching wrestling was truly normal for the age group. Outside of the Ultimate warrior nobody rammed the world like Brett ""The Hitman"" Hart did. We often thought ""man if we could get our hands on those fantastic pink robocop sunglasses, we'd be the coolest kids on the planet."" Well unfortunately the shades never worked out and either did the old boy Brett's career with the WWF. From the viewers standpoint it seemed to be the usual aging wrestler gracefully making his way out the back door. However after watching Wrestling with Shadows it was a totally different story. One that made you say to McMahon...I want to hit you, I want to hit you soooo bad!

As we stated in the previous paragraph Wrestling With Shadows explains exactly what happened to the Hitman's career. What started off as a situation where Sid said ""wouldn't it be hilarious to watch this Hitman movies?"" turned into an absolutely intriguing documentary. You really get to explore the studio space of the Hart family and in some odd way begin to legitimately like them. It documents Hart's 14 year career with the WWF from his moments as master of the house up to his sudden demise thanks to the crooked ways of Vince McMahon. The only thing good this wanna be meat head ever did was supply this planet with a daughter sporting a glorious rack. At least Brett smashed his face in, off camera, after the ultimate betrayal. It was somewhat similar to Vach's hand fork stabbing on Mr. Cross...yeah it was that satisfying.

Without a doubt Sid gives a full seal of approval for Hitman Hart: I want to wrestle you so freaking bad. It's the finest cinema to come out of Canada next to The Final Sacrifice. We even think we saw Rowsdower sitting front row at one of Brett's 1980's wrestling matches, or maybe it was some other drunk bloated hick. All we were expecting was to get a nice 90's B documentary under our belt, and wound up glued to the screen watching a true masterpiece. Sure Brett never dropped a coontz throughout the film but still managed to headlock us into a 5 star review. If you're a wrestling fanatic then you probably all ready own 4 copies of this on VHS, laserdisk, DVD, & bluray. But for the rest of the normal functioning world we implore you to watch this when you get a chance. Even if you never watched wrestling, it's just awesome.",1304985600,,2504,4.501098901098901
1224421,5,B00000INF7,"Documentaries and biographies are tough to recommend, because whether you like them depends on how familiar you are with the subject?  Would I have loved ""Hoop Dreams"" if I didn't grow in the western suburbs of Chicago?  Would I have loved ""Waiting For 'Superman'"" if my mother hadn't been an educator & school administrator?  Would I have loved ""An Inconvenient Truth"" if I had done my research and learned more about the environment?  Would I have loved ""Beyond The Mat"" if I wasn't a wrestling fan?

""Hitman Hart: Wrestling With Shadows"" is no exception.  I am a fan of televised pro wrestling, especially the WWE (formerly known as the WWF).  I've enjoyed this kind of entertainment for as long as I can remember, and I've been fascinated with the behind-the-scenes aspect since about the time this movie since premiered in the late '90s.

This documentary follows Bret Hart, the WWF's then-current champion, in last few months as he's on his way to leaving the company to work for a competing promotion.  Hart's career with the WWF has been a successful one, but like most stories from the world of entertainment, there's a darker side.  The final months with the WWF are becoming stressful and confusing.  Hart's final chapter with the company is to work with a fellow wrestler named Shawn Michaels; both men have an intense dislike for each other.

Even the quiet, tender moments with the Hart Family seem to have an undercurrent of sadness.  Bret's father, Stu, was a tough-as-nails father, who trains wrestlers by applying painful holds in his ""Dungeon"".  His mother, Helen, has always hated the fact that the family is involved in the pro wrestling business, and it's been over 40 years!  And the 12 Hart children were picked on when they were kids because their father was a wrestling promoter.

It's not all heartbreak, however.  In a weird way, Bret Hart seems to be having a lot of fun working with his brother and in-laws with the WWF's current script for him, even when the backstage drama gets frustrating.  His son, Blade, travels with him to the shows.  The cast of characters are unique and diverse, and seem to get along with Bret Hart pretty well.  There's a terrific part of the documentary when the WWF is coming to the Hart Family's hometown of Calgary, Canada, and the whole family gets involved with a tag team match involving 10 guys.  The crowd applauds & cheers to a fever pitch.

It's difficult to explain ""Wrestling With Shadows"" because pro wrestling, unlike movies or TV, spent many years keeping the secrets & tricks away from the general audience.  The whole business thrives on a glorified con where reality is questioned?  When someone gets hurt, are they faking it?  If someone really gets hurt, do the fans even know?  When Bret Hart's final performance for the WWF ends in a confusing controversy, I've always questioned whether pro wrestling fans really understood what went down before Bret Hart and WWF owner Vince McMahon addressed the situation to the media.  I won't give away the controversial turn-of-events; diehard fans already know what happens, & newcomers deserve to see it for themselves.

But will newcomers and non-fans get into ""Wrestling With Shadows""?  I personally think they will, although not for the reasons Bret Hart and director Paul Jay claim to.  The documentary began partially because they wanted to give a realistic (albeit sympathetic) look at a pro wrestler's day-to-day life.  On that level, ""Wrestling With Shadows"" works, especially because it does a good job of keeping things focused and tight.  Many wrestling documentaries tend to make references that newcomers don't understand, so it's a great relief that Paul Jay and his team didn't fall into that trap.

However, when the story ends, I don't think the documentary becomes an indictment of the pro wrestling business.  Its cynical look at the business somehow erases all of the pleasant memories from one's mind.  What is the documentary trying to say?  I don't think Paul Jay really has an answer.  I know wrestling fans will get into this because this was the most fair-and-balanced document we had of went down at the Molson Centre in Montreal during Bret Hart's final perofrmance.  However, I think people unfamiliar with the WWF are going to wonder what the big deal?  Why should they care?

It's my opinion that in ""Wrestling With Shadows"", Paul Jay acheived the hard part and slipped up on the easy part.  He somehow made pro wrestling understandable to the untrained viewer, much like ""Beyond The Mat"" did.  But he doesn't answer the most basic question: What's the point?  If the pro wrestling industry indeed has a dark side to it, then why should we care?  If Bret Hart's legacy with the WWF isn't a happy story, then what's the aftermath?  These are questions I feel casual viewers won't be able to answer, because ""Wrestling With Shadows"" hasn't prepared them for it.  As Bret Hart told the UK Sun in 2009, the filmmakers approached him and said, ""We don't have an ending.""  Seriously, think about ""Wrestling With Shadows"" without its final act; I'm betting the movie was conceptualized one way, but when the filmmakers caught a shocking different ending on tape, Paul Jay was then forced to merge the two together.

That's just my theory, anyway

I'm giving this 5 stars because I'm familiar with pro wrestling, and I think fans will absolutely love this!  However, this is a 4-star recommendation from me, because I think director Paul Jay could've done more to wrap it up.

The bonus disc features ""The Life and Death of Owen Hart"", another documentary from Paul Jay.  In all fairness, it's not very well put together, but I enjoyed it anyway.  4 stars for fans, 3 stars for the rest.",1301702400,2,5734,4.845679012345679

1224425,3,B00000INF7,"This documentary details a short period in the career of professional wrestler Bret Hart.  It just so happens that is filmed during the infamous Montreal Screwjob.

At the time of this documentary in 1997 Bret Hart was the World Wrestling Federation champion.  He had somewhat of a falling out with Vince McMahon and decided to leave for a rival promotion.  His contract stipulated he had creative control over his character if he decided to leave for the last 30 days of his tenure.  Not wanting to drop the title to rival Shawn Michaels in front of his Canadian and Montreal fans, he and McMahon agreed that the match would end in outside interference and brawl in the ring with no real conclusion to the fight.  In return, Hart promised to drop the title to Michaels on a later date.

That was how the fight was supposed end.  Instead, McMahon and Michaels concocted a scenario where Michaels would put Hart in a submission hold.  Hart was supposed to reverse it but as soon as the hold was administered in the ring McMahon came out and had the bell rung to end the fight and awarded the match to Michaels.

All the preliminary angst by Hart of his distrust of McMahon and the aftermath was recorded on film for posterity.

While the Montreal Screwjob was not the only aspect of the ring life of Hart chronicled here, that was the culmination of the film and what makes it a valuable piece.

While this film is very interesting there are some flaws.  The main flaw is I felt the scenes with Bret Hart and his wife talking about his contract with the WWF and trying to decide whether to leave seemed very scripted.  Also, there really is not a lot of detail on the intense animosity between Hart and Shawn Michaels that is detailed in Bret Hart's autobiography, Hitman.

Nevertheless, it is an interesting look into the world of professional wrestling and a snapshot of Bret Hart's later ring career.

This particular DVD also contains a biography of the career of Bret Hart's younger brother,  Owen Hart, and the tragic accident that lead to his death.",1280620800,5,2055,4.6170798898071626
1224426,5,B00000INF7,"I still remember when this documentary first aired back in '98 or so (the DVD is the 10-year anniversary of the original DVD, as opposed to when the documentary first aired).  I believe it aired on A&E or one of those similar cable channels.  Basically, a camera crew followed around WWF (now known as ""WWE"") wrestler, Bret Hart, filming his WWE professional life and personal life including his contract negotations with WWE owner Vince McMahon.  The documentary is somewhat unique as up until this point there had been little done or shown behind-the-scenes on pro wrestling.  Further, it just so happened that the year that was filmed led up to...and included...one of the most renowned and ""real-life"" controversies in the recent history of pro-wrestling ""The Montreal Screwjob."" (Granted, this documentary may have helped make it one of the most memorable and controversial events...).  Since the night of ""the Screwjob,"" everyone involved has had their say on what happened...  Wellllll (as ""Hawk"" would say), on this DVD you'll see exactly who got caught on camera saying what (and lying to Bret's face).  If you have an opinion...or interest...you'll want to watch it.  If you don't have an opinion or know the full story, you might decide to ""wikipedia"" it after watching this...there have been various ""revelations"" made in the years since, including admissions by Shawn Michaels.  It's a prime example of how - as strange as wrestling storylines may seem to many - the behind-the-scenes stories can be just as unusual!

Beyond the ""screwjob,"" there's much more covered in this documentary including Bret's struggles to balance his family life and wrestling career, his negotiations with Vince up until the time Bret departed the WWE, and battles with himself trying to decide what was best to do.  Some of the ""spin"" around that time was that Bret and others ""sold out"" and left Vince McMahon and the WWE in a bind; but again this documentary provides new insight about that - at least as far as Bret goes.  I also found memorable a scene with Bret expressing to some fellow wrestlers his true feelings about other wrestlers (such as Michaels and Triple H), and on the direction and storylines the Federation was taking.

Overall, after viewing this I definitely came away thinking that Bret was ""old-school"" and a ""traditionalist"" struggling in a business that seemed to be changing from what he believed it was or should be.  Bret is an interesting study - he's a hero in Canada, the all-time favorite of many wrestling fans, and clearly drew strong opinions about the changing sport and the way he was dis-loyally treated.  But others see him as inflexible and taking things a little too seriously, which may have led to his bitterness.  After viewing this the viewer can draw their own opinion...but if you know Bret's full story you cannot argue that he sacrificed all (and paid a very heavy toll indeed) for the sport that he dedicated his life to!

I would add this DVD isn't very redundant even if you've seen the Brett Hart DVD set or read his book (and I recommend those if you're a WWE or Bret Hart fan too).

New to this ""10-year anniversary"" edition are additional updated interviews (""10 years later..."" with Bret and others) as well as a documentary on the life and death of Owen Hart (Bret's younger brother, also a wrestler, who died doing a stunt during a ""pay-per-view"" event that took place not long after Bret left the WWE...and yet the PPV event continued!!!).",1275350400,7,3493,4.871621621621622

1224458,5,B00000INF7,"In today's wrestling world, Wrestlers are remembered for the great memories they give fans, and others are remembered for events surrounding their careers that place an asterik beside their name. Bret Hart seems to fall under both of these mantles, some very vew wrestlers can claim. He may not have been the flashiest guy, or the most flamboyant, but Bret was dedicated 100% to his career, something that he paid the price for in his personal and family life.

Hitman Hart: Wrestling With Shadows, documents that event caused Bret's career in WWE to come to a controversial end, a double-cross talked to even to this day. Wrestling might be sports-entertainment, but the politics behind the curtains are very real, and often very ugly.

This documentary follows Hart from his return to wrestling at Survivor Series 1996 against Stone Cold Steve Austin, to his final WWE match against Shawn Michaels one year later. Hart is very honest, and very frank about what he thinks about some of his fellow wrestlers, Michaels in particular.

The documentary is very well done, cut very well, and helps offer one insight into what was going through Hart's mind during this time, dealing with changes in mindsets of wrestling fans, Vince's decision to turn him hel, which would forever affect his character and direction in WWE, and the confrontations surrounding Survivor Series 1997 and the infamous Montreal Screwjob.

If You're a Bret Hart fan, pick this up. The documentary on Owen Hart is a great bonus to have as well. Also, look into picking up Hart's autobiography. There will never be another wrestler like Bret Hart. Like Hulk Hogan, Hart was truly one of a kind.",1271030400,,1664,4.932142857142857

The drama and politicing are very interesting and provide lots of insight into the wrestling biz, but I can't help but feeling that this is a bitter propaganda piece meant to smear Vinnie Mac.  The real heart of this set comes through in disc 2, which chronicles the life and death of Owen.  It also features interviews with the filmaker and Bret from 10 years after the movie release, which shows Bret in a much more thoughtful (and less bitter) light.  A word of warning: this movie is a DVD-R; worth every penny for a die-hard fan, but non-collectors may be a bit put off.",1260748800,2,864,4.477707006369426

I don't want to get into a debate of wrestling and its sub plots but lets suffice to say this exposes much of the hype and behind  the scenes politics.  The back  stabbing that went  on during this period  are legendary in  wrestling circles and the actors/athletes that double crossed Brett Hart went on to make a fortune  in the game which shows you how little honor has to do with anything anymore.  The bonus disc on his brother Owen who tragically died in a poorly planned and ridiculously dangerous stunt in conjunction with another event could be of interest again to non wrestling  fans.

If you ever wondered what goes on behind the scenes of the WWF/WWE, then this one is for you.

1224467,4,B00000INF7,"Besides the tragic death of Owen Hart and the recent Chris Benoit murder/suicide, this video shows the darkest period in the career of Bret ""Hitman"" Hart and in wrestling as a whole.

Up until that, we get a great look at the behind the scenes workings of the business and of some of the wrestlers! As the film goes on, we get to see that something is wrong in the relationship between Bret Hart and Vince McMahon which leads up to the big ""Montreal Screwjob"" in November 1997. Even Bret's wife at the time accussed HHH and Shawn of being in on it (which we now know they were)!

Personal note, I think both parties were wrong. Bret, knowing he was leaving, should've jobbed the title. However, if Vince told him that it was going to be a Double DQ, then that's how it should've went down. He could've did an angle where Bret gets stripped right after the match due to his conduct in the match or something.

I am no booker but I would've left the Double DQ intact, then either do the strip angle or have Bret do an angle where he pretty much says ""screw WWF"" and drops the belt at McMahon's feet and leaves! From there, I would've vacated the title and did the Royal Rumble thing were the winner gets the title shot and make the Casket Match with Undertaker and Shawn Michaels where the winner of that would be in the title match at WrestleMania as well!

Back to this video, its worth a look. No matter whether you love or hate Vince McMahon or Bret Hart, this was definitely one of the darkest periods of wrestling ever. Both sides suffered on this one. Obviously Bret moreso than Vince but neither left this story unscathed. See it.",1211760000,2,1636,4.371710526315789

Now, As of this month we have been through 10 years after November 9, 1997 or infamous Montreal Screw Job.

Try to find this product whether on VHS / DVD or whatever form. Why?

Because :

1. You will see that pro wrestling is real in many shapes and forms. Yes, it is predetermined, the moves maybe fabricated, but it truly does take a real toll on the wrestlers bodies.

2. You will see what really happens backstage without sugar coating.

3. You will see how the politics in wrestling play a major role in the outcome of the matches.

4. You can tell that bussiness is in the dumps today because of some of the desions that Vince McMahon has made on November 9, 1997 and beyond.

5. History can easlily be repeated if the current or future roster of talent is not careful.

6. What you hear or see on TV may not really be the truth. IMHO opinion, Vince can do better without both HHH & Shawn Michaels.

Folks, the documetary is truly a keeper, I have watched several times.
I understand that Vince has the right to protect his bussiness, but he could have made a different action then Screwing Bret in his home town.

How?

Well, Vince was scared that Bret would take the belt to WCW (like when Alundra Blaze threw the WWF championship belt in the garbage can on TV). But, I mean come on. They could have easily like agreed bewteen Vince and Bret that the match would end with an interfernece at the end of the champsionship bout. Then Vince would take the belt from Bret before leaving the building.

The next night on Raw Vince would approach the fans on RAW, and play a pre-tapped interview where Bret decides to let go of the belt for any given reason. Bret then goes to WCW (as agreed between him & Vince).

But to see what Vince has done, he made it clear that no one is safe, and that he is truly selfish and truly unprofessional.

I have for years enjoyed watching WWF/WWE, but after that dark day, I have lost interest. Why?

Because:

1. Lack of competion betwen wrestling organizations (No more WCW). Eating McDonalds can be cool, but eating it 3 times a week will make you sick.

2. The roster in the WWE lacks the same charisma that we saw in the 80's & 90's.

3. The storylines are boring and repetive.

4. The shows rely now mostly on Divas, immorale angles and has lost the faamily values (knowing the fact that merchandise is running wild because of the children).

5. Pushing related stars & and allowing them to be bookers (HHH), and burrying legends (Ric Flair).

6. WWE could have dones something to minimize the huge number of deaths in pro wrestling. By at least minimizing the tour days, or at least helping create a retirment fund where an amount is deducted from their salalry on monthly basis, or having them contribute one way or another in the wrestling bussiness. Or at least being more strict on the drug testing.

In the end, I hope you do enjoy the documentary, I & many friends of mine did. And the bottom line is, if you enjoy or enjoyed wrestling. And if you were or still is a Bret Hart fan, this documentary is for you !

While you are at it, grab Bret Hart's autobiography, I truly enjoyed reading it.

1224490,5,B00000INF7,"I've been a fan of the WWF/WWE ever since 1992. My two heroes were The Undertaker and the man featured in this docu, Bret The Hitman Hart. When I saw the SS in 97 I was shocked at what was unraveling before my eyes. This was too real to be just a storyline, this was an already ""turned heel"" hero being ripped apart and broken in just a few minutes. To me it seems that Bret still hasn't made it through the darkness that was brought upon by this and the tragedies afterwards. (Such as the death of his little brother Owen in a WWE stunt) I cringed when Bret ""turned heel"" in his last year at the WWE, it was so obviously fake and a built up to destroy his legacy. Sadly Bret, being a man of honor, truth and honesty, didn't see through the devious plotting of Vince and his ilk.

Wrestling With Shadows had me in tears so many times. Not just because of the SS 97 incident but because it turned a once happy, hopeful and positive man into a tormented, disillusioned shadow of his former self. As for business re: Bret not being allowed to retire from WWE as the reigning champion.....HOW MANY TIMES were there exceptions in that damn company? Couldn't they have arranged a fab Goodbye ceremony for their greatest athlete with the highlight being Bret passing the torch to the next generation? Would that have been bad ""business""?

Bret The Hitman Hart has shown immense strength, integrity and he has given millions of kids and adults all over the world what we all need: A hero. A hero who believes in the good in folks and who stands erect and strong against all odds. Bret Hart still is this hero. It's Vince who let greed and callous selfishness overpower any regard he may have had for Bret.",1177459200,,1697,4.3841269841269845
1224491,5,B00000INF7,"This was a great documentary. i bought before it had even gotten a distribution deal in this country and long before the 18 months after segment was added.
However, there was a lot of details that could have made things even better, regarding the survivor series finish. i sat here and read so many different reviews and it was great to see other people talking about this documentary and bret in such a positive light. However, it was the people calling Bret a selfish egomaniac that prompted me to write this review.
If anyone was a selfish egomaniac it was Shawn Michaels. If you went to bret's website [...] you could find somewhere on there, the wrestling observer article that dave meltzer wrote that gave all the details and the information that Shawn Michaels specifically told vince and bret that he was no longer going to lose to anyone in the federation. Yes, Shawn Michaels decided he was never going to lose another match in his career. Granted, that didn't come to pass but that is the reason Bret wouldn't lose to Shawn, along with his creative control clause, and his status as a Canadian hero, but because Shawn didn't have any respect for him so why should he show him any in return. He did everything to comfort Vince that he wouldn't run to WCW while holding the belt, even trying to delay his entrance to WCW. But because other people had screwed Vinny Mac, Vinny Mac wouldn't trust the Hitman.
  It's obvious that Vince wanted to discredit Bret, first making him despised in the country where he did 90% of his performing, and then making him look bad after his leaving for WCW. He was afraid to lose anymore ground to the competition, and so screwed the one man who carried his company in the wake of Hulkamania.
  In the end WCW blew itself up and further worsened Bret's career. But it was this documentary that made the WCW fans realize that Bret wasn't the jerk they treated him as and he later became in WCW, and it was shortly after this became widely distributed and played on tv that he gained his 1st WCW World title. then a couple months later, his career was over.
  To be honest, there are a couple slow points in the movie (if you have watched it more than a few times) and it certainly could have been a little more detailed, because there was a lot more to the story than what we saw. Otherwise, a great documentary about a man who did everything for a company he believed in and how that company ruined his life.

I think the Ironic part about this, is that this was made during the time that WCW was threating to put WWF out of business and yet 4 years later, Vince Mcmahon bought WCW, and a few months after this released in 1998, Raw began beating Nitro.

I always got the feeling that Bret Hart exaggerated on a lot of his facts, because it almost seemed like he was trying to act instead of being himself. I love the backstage look at wrestling in this, but as far as the story goes, i am not convinced that Bret Hart or Vince Mcmahon are being 100% honest in this, because i find it strange that this would release and totally bash Vince Mcmahons character and yet he didn't say anything about it.

By all means, if you like it, watch it. I have nothing against people who like this. This is just my opinion, others might be different. This gets 3 out of 5 stars, it is not a total waste of time.",1113523200,,1128,4.193548387096774

1224494,4,B00000INF7,"Simply put, 'Wrestling With Shadows' is the best documentary ever released exploring behind the scenes of pro wrestling, far surpassing the more popular and recognized 'Beyond the Mat', in my opinion.

If you love wrestling as I do, you will love this video -- regardless of how you feel about the infamously dubbed 'Montreal Screwjob'.  Being a longtime wrestling fan and having an above-average understanding of what has occurred and what goes on, both in the ring and in the locker room, I have always felt unfortunate for what had to happen to Bret, because it did tarnish what was a pretty amazing career in pro wrestling (I'll go on record as saying he is one of the top 5 technically sound wrestlers ever).  It also ruined his credibility and reputation when he finally did appear in WCW (where Bret was going shortly after Survivor Series '97).  Despite that, however, Vince McMahon did what he had to do to preserve his company, which was losing the so-called 'Monday Night Wars' with rival WCW.  I do not believe Vince ever intended to hurt Bret personally, as he would have (understandably) done the same thing to any wrestler on his roster who was jumping ship to a competitor and refused to drop the belt - Shawn Michaels and The Undertaker included.  Whether Vince screwed Bret or Bret screwed Bret, it is still the most talked about incident in pro wrestling history, 7 years later.

Still, the documentary is fantastic even outside the 'Screwjob', chronicling the final year of Bret Hart's WWF career, and how he struggles to come to terms with the changes at the beginning of the 'Attitude Era', where Stone Cold Steve Austin is the top face and Shawn Michaels is the top heel.  This leaves the Hitman wondering where his legacy fits into everything.  A lot has been said about Bret Hart over the years, from he's too self-serving, to he's too egocentric, to he wasn't a very good champion.  At the very least, this video shows how human Bret Hart is, and how much love he has for the business of Professional Wrestling.

Well, that really depends on you, the viewer.  I really think this is an interesting side of the WWF (now the WWE) that very few have ever seen.
The movie is about the life and career of a very well known and famous wrestler, Bret Hart.  It's about his life and his struggles with the WWF.  And with Mr. McMahon, of course.  Though wrestling is scripted, THIS is not.  You also get to see the lighter side of Bret.  The family side.  You also see the toll his career takes on them.
I was really in awe as I watched ""Hitman Hart: Wrestling with Shadows.""  A very interesting documentary about the dark side of wrestling and the lives it can make....or destroy.  Highly recommend this.  Even if you don't like wrestling, you still might find this interesting.
In the end, Vince says ""Bret screwed Bret.""  After seeing this, I'm not too sure about that.  Don't know what to think.  I really do enjoy the WWF, but it's hard to know for sure who was right.  This documentary does open you mind to ideas and theories.  In the end, it's really YOU who decides is telling the truth.",1026518400,9,1218,4.4389140271493215
1224521,5,B00000INF7,"Bret ""Hitman"" Hart has been my favorite wrestler ever since I first watched this documentary on A&E a few years ago.  He had always been a great wrestler, but after having watched this riveting tale of Hart's association with the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) in 1996-97, he became my hero.
Bret Hart's tale in this video is both happy and sad.  In the beginning moments of the film, we see a light-hearted and very accomodating Hitman talking about his family and how he started in wrestling.  He talks about growing up a Hart, and how life at the house was not always so wonderful.  For the first 20-30 minutes, this film shows us the happier side of Bret Hart.  And that's when things get interesting.
World Championship Wrestling (WCW) made Hart an incredible offer that he almost couldn't refuse.  But, as a man of integrity and moral values, he inititally declined the WCW's offer out of loyalty to Vince McMahon, the owner of the WWF.  Instead of taking a three-year contract worth $9 million from the WCW, he signed a 20-year contract for significantly less with the WWF.
Bret Hart's topsy-turvy road in 1997 is a captivating one to travel on for the audience.  Anyone who knows wrestling knows the name Bret Hart and what has happened with him throughout his career.  This documentary, so beautifully done by director Paul Jay, gives you the dirt on what Hart's life was like back when wrestling was just starting to come into its more adult nature.
This film gives you the entire scoop on why Bret Hart was turned heel (turned into a bad guy).  This film shows you exactly what happened at the now infamous 1997 Survivor Series, which forever changed the direction of WWF programming.  You will see it all as the happy and appreciative Bret Hart from the first 20-30 minutes is slowly chipped away until a depressed and demoralized Bret Hart is left in the wake of what the WWF and Vince McMahon did to him.
After the film, there is a special interview with Bret Hart and director Paul Jay that takes place 18 months later following the double-cross at the 1997 Survivor Series.  Bret Hart goes on to tell what life has been like since his departure from the WWF and how things in his life have drastically changed.  One shock, for example, is his admittance of his divorce.  This comes as such a surprise since we see him and his wife sticking so closely together in the film.
In short, this is one of the best wrestling documentaries out there.  They don't get any more real than this, and any wrestling fan will find Bret Hart's real-life battle with Vince McMahon intriguing.
On a personal note, Bret Hart, in my mind, will always be the Excellence of Execution.  He will always be ""The Best There Is, The Best There Was, and The Best There Ever Will Be.""  He deserved to have a grand exit from professional wrestling.  It's just too bad that neither the WWF nor the WCW had the decency to give him one.",1006732800,36,2920,4.582692307692308
1224522,5,B00000INF7,"This is almost the ""ultimate"" documentary.  Brett Hart was considered one of the great ""heroes"" of professional wrestling until the owner of the WWF, Vince McMahon thought it would be better to make him a villain. Brett resisted the character change at first, but he noticed American wrestling audiences were cheering for the ""anti-hero"" so he used that idea to get the audience to ""boo"" him.  what happens during the filming of this documentary is a chronicle of events that seem to indicate that he was the victim of some shady ""backstage politics"".  The villain becomes none other than Brett's former boss, Vince McMahon. Watch the documentary and judge for yourself.  This is a great story even if you aren't a fan of professional wrestling. It's almost worth the whole show to watch Brett working out while listening to ""Pacing The Cage"".  Watch the tape and see what I mean!",1006128000,,880,4.84
1224523,5,B00000INF7,"This is probably the best documentary I have ever seen. It follows Harts life growing up in a wrestling family, and ends with Harts disputed last match with the WWF. It is utterly compelling to see Hart struggle with Vince Mcmahon's betrayal after giving him a 20 year contract-then decicing he wanted out of it. Watching(in hindsight) him tell Hart he wants him to go to WCW, then lie about why he was leaving, lie about the supposed ending of the match at Survivor Series, and ultimately lie about everything to do with Hart is pretty disgusting to watch. If wrestling lasts 1000 more years, we will never have as compelling footage as is on here from that match. Watching Earl Hebner practically dive out of the ring as soon as he calls for the bell, and Mcmahon wiping the spit from his face as Hart glares at him from the ring with disgust is absolutely riveting. It's just a shame that they didn't include the part of the Mcmahon interview where he claims he ""let"" Bret knock him out afterwards. It would have brought some levity to a film which is pretty sad to watch for anyone who knows Bret Hart deserved to be treated with respect.",1006041600,5,1142,4.4951923076923075

1224550,5,B00000INF7,"&#65279;This movie is not only the best wrestling documentary I have ever seen, but probably the best documentary on any subject that I have viewed.
It is a real and truthful depiction of former five-time World Wrestling Federation World Champion, Bret `Hitman' Hart, as he was betrayed by fellow wrestlers and his boss, Vince McMahon.
Bret Hart talks about growing up in Calgary, Alberta in a wrestling family.  In the process he suffered verbal abuse from classmates and physical abuse from his father, wrestling legend Stu Hart (Order of Canada, 2001).
By the time Bret Hart hit the age of forty he worked his way up the wrestling ladder, to the point where he replaced Hulk Hogan as the WWF's top star.
Though the Federation's biggest name in the 1990s, Hart is forced to leave, and then double-crossed in his final match in order to ruin his name in the wrestling business.  Essentially, on 9 November 1997 in Montreal Bret was promised that he would be allowed to leave the WWF on his own terms, but that was a lie by WWF management.
In a match with Shawn Michaels, Hart is embarrassed with an abrupt end to the match as Michaels had Bret in his trademark submission move, the `sharp shooter'.  The match ends instantly with Bret Hart, a Canadian hero, being 'cut down' in his own nation.
The picture reaches it's climax with Bret Hart punching-out WWF owner and CEO, Vincent McMahon behind closed doors.  Wrestling With Shadows accounts for the fall of Bret Hart in the WWF.  It is a sad story of his final days in the very company he helped save, and sacrificed for.  Such sacrifice included turning down millions of dollars from World Championship Wrestling, working injured and being subject to slander from WWF creative control (Bret Hart was portrayed as anti-American and a racist).
I recommend this movie, and hope you enjoy it.",982454400,16,1842,4.758620689655173
1224551,5,B00000INF7,"HITMAN HART: WRESTLING WITH SHADOWS is an astounding documentary that chronicles the story of Bret Hart, a loyal & devoted wrestler in the WWF, whose loyalty was rewarded by a wily promoter... Bret Hart & Paul Jay took the viewers into the most private moments of Hart's life in the WWF. The video showed the viewers how Bret cared about his wrestling career, his devotion to his chosen profession, his love for his family, his opinions about certain people in the WWF, his observation on how wrestling has changed over the years, & his relationship with WWF owner Vince McMahon, who stabbed Bret in the back after Bret gave 14 years of his life working for the WWF.
During the making of this video, Bret just signed a deal with McMahon for less money but a 20 year contract with the WWF. He could've gone to WCW for more money, but Bret felt a sense of loyalty to the WWF & Vince McMahon & opted to stay in the WWF. While this was going on, WCW was beating the WWF in the ratings. Vince later told Bret that he can't afford him anymore & wanted him out of his deal. Bret reluctantly agreed because he didn't want to leave the federation he has called home for 14 years. Then, on his last match for the WWF before leaving for rival promotion WCW...
I can't recommend this film enough. If you love wrestling & want to know what goes on behind the scenes, get this video & BEYOND THE MAT (Director's cut). You won't be disappointed.",981676800,5,1430,4.4
1224552,5,B00000INF7,"This documentary really makes you think.  On one hand, Bret Hart was indeed embarrassed in his final match in the WWF.  On the other hand, Bret Hart may have requested something that he could not possibly have control of.  Did Vince McMahon handle the situation the best way?? No, he did admit to lieing. However, maybe Bret could've understood the owner's point of view as well as his own and not expected so much.
Lots of questions are raised here and two years later there are still plenty of opinions and sidebars.  This movie is not just about the Wrestling business but about many aspects of the business world itself.  There is a fine line between loyalty and betrayal and Paul Jay depicts this story very well.  He asks the tough questions and gives very ellaborate interpretations.  He gives a good history of the Hart family and what it was like growing up in the Wrestling Business.
Whereas this documentary will mostly appeal to fans of the Squared Circle, it does cross over very well to the morals of good and evil and loyalty and betrayal.  Therefore, those who can stomach a little violence will definitely appreciate the many messages this film will give.",971827200,2,1172,4.71078431372549
1224553,4,B00000INF7,"Canadian film-maker Paul Jay beautifully put together the first wrestling  documentary to expose the industry and break kayfabe, but ironically it  does more against the Canadian ""legend"" Hart than for him. It  shows how Stu Hart's old school mentality influenced his mistreatment of  his own sons, most of whom were forced into wrestling. ""It was for  Stu, not for me,"" Bret says in one scene. In many scenes, Bret is  shown brooding, portrayed as a troubled and tormented human being. Paid  more than three times the salary of his rival Shawn Michaels, the World  Wrestling Federation's ratings failed to justify it, and so his  ""father figure"" employer of fifteen years, Vince McMahon, let him  go, spending the money on creating the pop-culture company we know today.  However, Hart refused to relinquish the company's top prize, the WWF World  Championship, at a major Pay-Per-View show upon his leave, and so McMahon  banged his head against a wall, until finally forcing Hart to lose the  title. Whilst many come away from the film seeing McMahon as having  ""screwed"" Hart, those who know and understand passion for the  business and loyalty to a struggling company and owner rivalled by a  multi-billion dollar conglomerate, will see beyond the words of the pass  Hitman. Hart's family and friends left the WWF after the incident, yet when  similar ""screw-jobs"" happened to them, he failed to stand by  them. One of them, Hart's brother-in-law, British Bulldog Davey Boy Smith,  returned to the WWF, and subsequently Hart stated in his Calgary newspaper  column he'd run over his sister, Diana Hart-Smith, if he saw her in the  street. Indeed, Hart is a bitter human being, and Wrestling With Shadows  shows it, seen clearly once one looks past the propaganda. An unprecedented  piece of film-making.",968716800,6,1808,5.047457627118644

Although I  knew the appalling way his career was ended in the WWF by the devious  machinations of the powers that be, this documentary was absolutely  compelling to watch and explained in more detail what really went on.  It  also shows the human side of Bret and his great loyalty to his family and  fans.  I will admit at the end, the look of utter betrayl on Bret's face,  was so intense I was nearly moved to tears to myself.

1224570,5,B00000INF7,"There is so much about this film that is compelling that I don't know where to start.  It serves not only to document the last year of Bret Hart's career in the WWF, but also shows the digression of  pro-wrestling.
Though I don't pay much attention to wrestling these days,  I was a big fan when I was younger.  I caught this documentary on A&E  and was fascinated by it.
It's difficult to describe this film without  spoiling the ending.  Bret Hart begins as the ultimate hero and over the  course of a year becomes a villan, ending his time in the WWF in a  disgraced state of uncertainty.  Throughout this time, Hart never loses his  sense honor and purpose and never betrays his ""true fans"".  Without revealing too much, Paul Jay's film reveals that in the amoral  enclave of pro-wrestling, this has disastrous consequences.
The home  video contains a bonus interview with Hart and Paul Jay which serves as an  effective coda.  Hart and Jay discuss the devastating aftermath of Vince  McMahon's betrayal of Hart; it is clear that Hart's life is in disarray.  Ironically, the moral of the story may be, 'Don't place too much personal  importance in your job'.  At one point during the interview, Hart discusses  his current situation in WCW (another wrestling organization he joined  after WWF) and how he is loathed by fans.  His response, ""They pay me  enough to live with that."", is indicative of his post WWF attitude  toward his work.
As many critics have noted, Shadows reveals a factual  story more compelling than most fiction writers could create.  It is a  documentary that proves more interesting than the subject matter (pro  wrestling) from which it draws.",956793600,6,1672,4.768421052631579

The film does a good job of concentrating on and chronicling of the increasingly differing views of McMahon and Hart towards the wrestling business and its supposed creative direction as well as the ensuing fallout, ending with the infamous ""Montreal Screwjob"".
While Hart tried to use his star power to emphasize the wrestling component in the storylines, McMahon took a broad kitchen-sink approach (monikered ""Crash TV"" by former WWE headwriter Vince Russo) to oust his rival Ted Turner, moving away from the sport towards ""sports entertainment"".
But even if Hart tries to convince us about the noble plight of his actions one cannot shake the feeling that his motives were largely egocentric. Hart freely admits in the film that while ""loyalty is important"" obviously it is not as important as money as he waxes about the astronomic salaries that awaited him in WCW. He also let it transpire that no matter what creative direction the WWE would take he was bent on retiring asap anyway. So for McMahon pulling through with Hart's 20-year contract would be like riding a deadbeat horse.

So at the end the most valuable lesson to be learned from WwS is the consequences of fame getting to your head.",1471046400,,1562,4.8943396226415095
