8148967,1,B000J3EJSM,"The product arrived on time, but the DVD and case have an AWFUL smell--very smoky like the smell after a house fire. The picture on the DVD case and the DVD itself look like they were made in someone's home on a bad printer. This is probably a pirated copy that's been  RECORDED off TV and resold! How did this end up for sale on AMAZON? It's definitely NOT from a regular company! Buyer beware! I've never written a review before on Amazon, but this is a scam.",1472860800,,461,4.238636363636363
8148968,1,B000J3EJSM,I was disappointed with this product. I wouldnt suggest buying it. It did not add to the content of the Freedom Writers story.,1444521600,,126,4.521739130434782
8148969,5,B000J3EJSM,"Since discovering the Freedom Writers two years ago, I've found myself progressively more interested in the story.  This year I reserve Fridays for each of my English classes (high school) to do something ""Freedom Writers.""  This video, while short, is an excellent addition to any set, library or collection that has to do with teaching, redemption, renewal, heroism or hope.  The Freedom Writers story is proof positive of what is possible when education is done right.  Bravo!",1332892800,2,479,5.181818181818182
8148970,2,B000J3EJSM,Does not add a great deal of information that is particularly valuable if one is interested in instructing students about the Freedom Writers Project. I would not recommend it.,1249948800,,176,5.103448275862069
8148971,5,B000J3EJSM,I use the movie in my classroom of 10th graders and we do a major writing project after we watch it.  THis edition shows the real teacher and the real kids when they were doing the action and it even inspires my kids more.  Great information too.,1184457600,16,246,4.212765957446808
