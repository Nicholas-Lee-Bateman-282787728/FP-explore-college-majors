8749031,5,B01B1QCE3W,Excellent stuff if you keep an open mind. Great for an experienced martial artist who wants an edge. Maybe a bit confusing for a total amature.,1470355200,,143,4.538461538461538
8749032,1,B01B1QCE3W,"Terrible. Silat video explains NOTHING! Kali dvd Doesn't play in ANY OF THE 4 DIFFERENT DVD PLAYERS OR PLAYSTATION 3&4 I own. But the Arnis DVD plays BUUUTTTT Explains NOTHING. You literally hear a British woman tell you ""This drill is a warm up"" ""when attacking with a knife smile like a good happy chap."" 2nd ones  exaggerated but  you are basically watching two guys do techniques with no explanation on both DVDs. And it's very sad and I'm disappointed in Amazon for having it in the instructional section. No stars unless they make me give 1. Ok I'm being made to do it -'''' Negative 2",1460160000,,591,4.514018691588785
