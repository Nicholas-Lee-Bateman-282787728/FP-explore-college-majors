This actually is a sad reflection of the type of corruption our country is exposed to on all levels; starting by the government that does not invest one penny of taxpayers money in at least having a humane place for criminals.  How on earth do you think you make a difference in the life of a criminal under these conditions, . . . no bathrooms? . . .
