3985041,3,B002TMVKYC,"The documentary is well written and edited but who will buy this? Willan ""impressionable"" 16 year old buy it and understand the message?

OPn the other hand, there's alot here to deal with: we watch Billy Joel effectively admit that he's part of an industry which manipulates the pysche of the very young and encourages anti-social behavior.

Artists like Mick jagger and eLton John have causually mentioned that rock is ""sexually charged""...sexually charged is okay for adults, but for 12 year olds? Does Michael Jackson and Madonn ahave som explainming to do.

As ""rap"" has become a major component of the new music for youth, it's felt that there's more trouble ahead: the lyrics tell it like it is and it's for real: people of all races are represented by this ""oral tradition"";brought up by alchoholics/druggies, no money, no role models; bad public schools.

In all fairness, ""risque"" music has been with us long before the Rock and Roll era, which started in 1956. But that early music also combined elemnts of Gospel, Jazz, and Country. It takes some thought...fire and brimstone will not move the average teenager to leave this stuff behind.

The pastor wants fans to admit that ""Satan"" has something to do with metal, rap, whatever. Even has evil messages el;ectronically implanted in the multi-tracks.

3985048,3,B002TMVKYC,"Running time on this DVD is a little over 2:56.  The DVD is stock shiny aluminum on the playing side, which is a definite plus (Eric Holmberg's HELL'S BELLS and HELL'S BELLS 2 are on DVD-Rs).

This set breaks down as eleven (11) chapters--no extras:

The Conversation
Devil's Divas and the Power of Music
Title
Chapter
The Kings of Rock 'n Roll
Mr. Crowley:  The Other Loch Ness Monster
The Battle and Sympathy for the Devil
Sorcery in the '60s and '70s
Michael Jackson:  King of Pop
Hell and Who Goes There
New Life and A New Song

Overview:  The DVD opens with a darkly lit poker game demon conspiracy (heh, heh, heh, like that painting of Dogs Playing Poker?), a segue into short clips of Ozzfest ""Man in the Street"" interviews, then Pastor Joe Schimmel beginning the first of many breaks from his studio setup (a round raised platform, 1940s neon jukebox off to the left, and a big screen TV endlessly repeating a fiery screensaver program with the DVD title spiraling down into H-EEE-Double-Toothpicks).

This presentation looks like Schimmel/producers reused most of a 1993 documentary (VHS era), grafting a 2003 MTV Video Awards clip(s) featuring Madonna and her two more youthful clones, Britney Spears and Cristine Aguilera, vamping around in underwear and (in)famously kissing.  Most of the presentations otherwise in this video seem to be sourced from various clips of VH-1's BEHIND THE MUSIC programs, backing up with various quotes from kiddie pop music magazines like SPIN and HIT PARADER, with Pastor Joe Schimmel doing voice-overs on the clips.  There's a REALLY UNCOMFORTABLE hospital clip after the Britney Spears/Madonna/Christine Aguilera tryst, and this section ends with some very low, low video of Insane Clown Posse from one of the cable channels (I think VH-1), Eminem, and a Marilyn Manson Nuremburg Rally-esque concert.

Ground zero for rock 'n roll and Satanism seems to have started with Tuvok (the actor from STAR TREK VOYAGER who wore pointy ears and looked both serious and deadpan angry) as Robert Johnson selling his soul, literally, to Satan while bumming off a couple highways in Mississippi (Mississippi is therefore in Hell?), vastly improving his guitar playing.  The clips used source from a 1986 movie, CROSSROADS.

Apparently portly Bill Haley started the whole downward slide as ""the Trojan Horse of Rock 'n Roll,"" then Elvis (lots of occult dropping and unfulfilled murderous plotting), brief mention of Jerry Lee Lewis and Little Richard, a LOT of attention to Aleister Crowley (which got me getting interested a bit in wondering about his influence), homosexuality, NAMBLA, Dr. Kinsey, Hugh Hefner and PLAYBOY, a brief presentation on a little purported backmasking in Led Zeppelin's ""Stairway to Heaven,"" but by then I was quite bored, tired out, and numbed by the experience.  I watched it three times, taking notes the 3rd time around.

My favorite quote in the set is ""1960s:  Sewage out of the cesspool of Satan's heart.""--Schimmel is well-schooled on Spiro T. Agnew alliteration staccato style, a la Agnew's ""nattering nabobs of negativity"" shtick.  Most interesting section I caught was about the 50-minute mark, where Pastor Joe Schimmel recounts being a (rock music) songwriter and transcribing lyrics from spirits of the underverse as they fed him songs.  He states, ""Hell is like an Italian restaurant"" (that's an image!  I would have thought a rundown Reno casino environment, dark, red and black decoration, no clocks...) and comments on boiling frogs.  This particular section establishes that Pastor Joe Schimmel claims to be an ""ex-rocker,"" a la Pastor Bob Larson, Michael K. Haynes, Eric Barger, Michael Plont, Jeff Ling, Lynn A. Bryson, Jack R. Christianson, Jeff Godwin, and who else escapes me as I write this...

If you've ever found yourself channel surfing catching something interesting on PBS during the pledge drives (A-list shows to lure PBS donations which break up into 20+ minute hard-selling advertising for the service every few months), you'll catch the presentation style of this set. This set functions as a decent, if very heavy on the stomach, secondary work compared to the standard set by Eric Holmberg's 1993 HELL'S BELLS and HELL'S BELLS 2.",1434067200,2,4227,5.1148255813953485
3985049,5,B002TMVKYC,"If you're a fan of stuff like Cannibal Corpse, Morbid Angel, Slayer, Marilyn Manson, Ghost BC, or just a black metal fan in general (Dimmu Borgir, Cradle of Filth, etc..) then this movie is simply the best comedy money can buy.  Honestly.  I've never laughed so hard.

3985055,3,B002TMVKYC,"I have to admit, while it does contain many typically purposeful misinterpretations of rock n roll lyrics, this doc is actually very well researched, even going back to Robert Johnson and his deal at the crossroads - that part, in particular, is quite creepy and fascinating when presented with Johnson's actual music and vocals. I am not, by any stretch, a Christian or even religious - so I present this review from that of an agnostic interested in the subject of rock-n-roll and the idea of selling one's soul to the Devil for fame, talent, and fortune. I thought I'd just end up blowing this one off as your usual lame Christian warning of the perils of evil rock-n-roll. But, again, this very long doc is well researched and (if you can tolerate the host-narrator, who I found quite annoying), then I think even an atheist or spiritualist or any other person, for that matter, who is interested in this subject may be surprised at how well it holds your attention.",1414108800,4,970,4.678362573099415

3985060,5,B002TMVKYC,This is truly a captivating documentary. It has proven to be a bold look at the reality that is obviously being denied by the major news networks.

3985061,1,B002TMVKYC,"The producers of this documentary have definitely sold their soul to reductionism--a satanic scheme of making part of the truth the whole truth. Using the same reductionism, one can also produce a documentary like this about the dark side of the church, or Christianity.

In fact, the producers of this series are already part of the dark side of the church because of their dishonesty and manipulation of the truth.  They might claim to be faithful to Christ, but their actions are exactly like those of the pharisees of Jesus time that crucified Christ.  These are the ones that Jesus would say to them, ""I don't know you!"" because they don't have any likeness of Christ at all in their schemes.

I am a faithful follower of Jesus Christ and a fourth generation Christian leader, and I've seen enough of the internal Judases that can fill thousands of hours of documentaries like this about the Christian church.  In fact, you can do this about anything on this fallen world.

The original spirit of rock and roll is about honesty, transparency, and passion.  No doubt, and like anything, there were, and are, corruptions.  Young people should be taught to appreciate what is good and avoid what is bad.  They should not be brainwashed like this.

If Jesus saw this film, he would surely weep, seeing the satanic craftiness done in his name!",1399852800,9,1343,4.774891774891775

3985064,1,B002TMVKYC,"It is ludicrous to tie the Beatles in with Satan worshippers.  George was raised Catholic and later developed an interest in Eastern religion.

3985069,2,B002TMVKYC,"Ok, so a lot of the stuff in this movie is true, even though it's totally over exaggerated. There was a lot of stuff in this that wasn't true, had been altered, or was totally one-sided. There was a picture that was altered in one scene. When they were talking about Metallica, they were giving them shit over a COVER song, Metallica didn't write the song. The song was called ""The Prince"", they said that it was by the heavy metal band Motorhead, but I know the song to be by the band Diamond Head. So not only do they alter stuff, they have a lot of information that's off. Still on Metallica, they touched on the song ""The God That Failed"" and put the song over another Metallica music video totally unrelated to the song, making them look like they're blaspheming God. The song isn't about blaspheming God, it's about the overly religious parents of James Hetfield, the lead singer of Metallica. There was another seen on disc four, talking about the satanic killing of a young girl. It said that one of the killers stated ""I am embarrassed that I let music influence me"". When in disc one, they changed his words and said ""I am embarrassed that I let Slayer's music influence me"". So they also change the words in this movie, and the lead singer of Slayer is a catholic. I also didn't like how they took things that were said sarcastically seriously. I was disappointed by this, and was even more disappointed on how they altered so much. Total propoganda.",1342569600,5,1461,4.516981132075472

I usually buy my kid Casting Crowns, and other awesome Christian music. But there was a new CD that EVERYONE in her middle school sings a song to, so I thought I'd try it out and buy it, and I read the lyrics, and saw the horrid propaganda on the inside of the CD and on the outside, as it's always subliminal or whatever. NO GOOD. I'm tired of all these stupid people wanting fame so much that they spread evil and massive nihilism out of selfishness and greed.

People in general need to be woken up, and make the choice -to move away from all the things that are keeping us asleep, deceiving us, stealing everything we love right out from under our noses.

These people are from my generation, & I had no idea about any of this.  I loved the 60's & 70's classic rock music & happily danced blisters on my feet from the mid 60's thru the 70's.  I really didn't like hard rock or heavy metal...but I love to dance to the classic rock of the time. The drums, the guitars, keyboard & singers could really get me going nonstop til I was just exhausted.  I am a Christian since I was very little, & was always nurtured & guided by my parents & grandparents.  They liked Mitch Miller, Brook Benton, the Platters, & Marty Robins.  So do I...but I sure wasn't aware of the intentions & agenda of the wild rock bands.  I've learned so much since my youth. The honest presentation in this video of facts about our musical ""entertainment"" has been a good education of a heartbreaking truth.  I recommend it highly to parents & teens.
