7380901,3,B01423S8A4,"""Knight of Cups"" (2015 release; 118 min.) brings the story of Rick (played by Christian Bale). As the movie opens, after some abstract shots of the earth from space, we are introduced to Rick, who is at a party of some sort (maybe his birthday party?). From there, we quickly move on as Rick encounters a woman, the first of a number of them. To tell you more would not only be close to impossible (for reasons explained below), it might also affect your viewing experience, so you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: this is the latest movie from writer-director Terrence Malick, now a crisp 72 years young. His 70s movies ""Badlands"" and ""Days of Heaven"" remain tops, now 40 years later. In ""Knight of Cups"", Malick continues what he started in 2011's ""The Tree of Life"", and then goes one (or two) steps further. ""Knight of Cups"" is pretty much a completely abstract movie, with little to no dialogue (Bale has less than 5 lines in the entire movie), and various voice-overs that deliver lines like ""So much I was given, so much I've left behind"" or ""Life: a goddess"", I mean, what does that even mean? This supposedly examines the meaning of life, but it's difficult to make that out from watching the movie, Bale stares and grimaces a LOT, in particular into the sky (seemingly every passing helicopter or plane is caught on film). The movie is divided into 8 chapters (such as ""The Moon"", ""The Tower"", ""The High Priestess"", etc.), not that it makes any difference as to the end product, as the movie to me felt like a two hour stream of consciousness expressed in pictures. Yes, the photography and shot composition is gorgeous, pure eye-candy. Cate Blanchett, as the ex-wife, gets about 10-15 minutes, max, of screen time and she does the best she can with the cards dealt to her in this. Natalie Portman looked completely lost to me. Bottom line: I love Terrence Malik, but this is nowhere near his best work, in my humble opinion.

This movie premiered at the 2015 Berlin Film Festival over a year ago. Not sure why it's taken this long to finally get a release in the US. The movie opened this weekend at my local art house theater here in Cincinnati, and the Saturday early evening screening where I saw this at was attended fair at best (about 10 people). I can't imagine still will stick around longer than 1 or 2 weeks. I made it through the movie, and still can't make up my mind whether this was just pretentious crap or a beautiful ode to life. Suffice to say that this movie has gotten a wildly varying reception from the so-called movie critics/experts, I am not an expert, but as a film fan, I'm not sorry that I saw it (I mean, it's Terrence Malick!) but neither would I rush to see it again. All that said, if you have a chance to see this, be it in the theater on Amazon Instant Video or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray. I encourage you to check it out and draw your own conclusion.",1458950400,5,2938,4.479477611940299
7380902,4,B01423S8A4,"A second screening resulted in bumping Knight of Cups up to 4 from 3 stars. The sometimes stunning camerawork manages to lift a disjointed tale into something pleasant, despite crystallization rarely if ever occurring. If you've heard about how the film was produced, it's easy to understand why this is not anything in the realm of When Harry Met Sally.
Knight of Cups departs sharply from the expected cinema experience; although not confirmed until after the fact, I'd a gut feeling I'd been witnessing some improvisation unfold in front of me.

As in opera, the soundtrack here is crucial to what the film is trying to pull off (but thankfully the actors don't sing). Kudos to whoever arranged the music, because it is fundamental to the transcendental nature of Knight of Cups. I was astonished to hear Hyperborea by Biosphere, which is from the definitive arctic ambient album&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Substrata/dp/B00692K41S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Substrata</a>&nbsp;(listening on a repetitive loop as I write this).

If only I could tell you that you'll love or hate or feel indifferent towards Knight of Cups, but it's difficult to describe a formula to compare against. People who hate ""Hollyweird"" will, with the odd exception, absolutely hate the film... which is completely ironic, since it seems to indict shortcomings of Hollywood: excess, emptiness, and style over substance. Both malcontents and admirers will find themselves envious of Christian Bale, who not only rollicks around in a flat with two half-naked supermodels, but also has the good fortune of Natalie Portman teasing his mouth with her toes (1 of my 3 wishes should I stumble upon a djinn in a bottle... gosh, did I just say that on the Internet?) This looked as much a surprise to him as to me, which it may well have been, given the improvisational narrative thrown at him.

Watching KoC under the influence of something (or several things) may enhance rather than detract from the experience; these days I watch movies stone cold sober, and still enjoyed this one. If you think you might not like Knight of Cups, you probably won't; if you think you might, change your paradigm by taking the advice of Alec Guinness and ""Let go, Luke.""",1453507200,14,2274,5.2076502732240435

This film provides a sense of things but never stares or examines what it's looking at or narrating too directly and gives the sense by its manner of filming and its subjects - both opulent wealth and the most gorgeous people on the planet and in other scenes the scrim of poverty and decay, visions of the manifestations of poverty and illness - that this lack of attention is the message, a restlessness in an LA and Vegas, the land of extremes and too much everything, whether wealth and fame or poverty and invisibility.

7380921,5,B01423S8A4,"A beautiful psychedelic journey, a bizarre mind f*#% experience. Not your average movie, most people unfortunately won't realize what an irreplaceable treasure this film is, Terrence Malick has created a wonderful masterpiece. I litteraly felt like i could die in peace after watching this film because i was fortunate enough to witness such a grand essence of perfection. Im a huge Christian Bale fan, but that doesnt mean i like all his movies, but this seriously is one of his greater films. Just as good as the dark knight trilogy, the prestige, american psycho, the fighter, the machinist, the big short, american hustle, flowers of war, public enemy, the new world...well yeah you get what i mean, Christian Bale does it again big time, what a huge success Knight Of Cups is. I loved how they played such beautiful mesmerizing music from the begining to the end of the film, the sound track was just perfect. The orchestra music in Knight of cups has a sort of psychedelic sound to it in my opinion, which the movie wouldnt be complete without. Roger Ebert gave the film a 4/4 but i was still amazed how many people gave it a poor review, had to watch it for my self to be the judge. A simple minded person who likes going to the movies to see only action, horror or comedy will never understand this film. Truely a film for the greatest of minds. Christian Bale, Terrence Malick and everyone responsible for the making of the soundtrack and film are Gods in our time. If i can relate this movie with another, it would be Michael Fassbender's Shame, which is another film Roger Ebert rated 4/4. After watching the Knight of Cups trailer and watching the film, the only movie that came to my head with stricking similarities was Shame, i highly recommend that film aswell, its a grand masterpiece.",1505001600,12,1802,4.669811320754717

7380934,5,B01423S8A4,"To enter into this experience as one reared on conventional three-act structured films is like reading The Sound and the Fury after a lifetime of Stephen King books. This is not a slur on King, he is a fine writer, but he is not Faulkner. Malick's filmmaking approach is similar. His appoach is purely experiential, not so much concerned with the ""outcome"" of character conflict, as he is of the emotive range derived from it. Therefore, it cannot benefit from current marketing ploys or star power... Malick has no use for it. This is cinema in the deepest etymology of the word. That is ""kinema,"" in that the celluloid flows through time, ""kinetics"" - moment to moment unmindful of what came before or after, purely by chance encounters, as in ""real"" life. There is moving water, the fluidity of the evershifting world, and to take any satisfaction from Knight of Cups is to stay present to it. Christopher (Peter Matthiessen, in a short cameo), tells Elizabeth (Natalie Portman) that he ""only teaches the present."" This can be said for the director who is not only concerned with the present, but our moment-to-moment prowess. When the past is intermingled with the present, it is to merge existence as an entity unto itself without credence for past/present/future... but what IS.

The lead character, Rick (Christian Bale) is not content with what he has; always he strives for more. It is this thirst for experience that not only makes him a pilgrim ""in this world"" like that of Christian in Pilgrim's Progress, but also the Prodigal Son returning to a home that never was home in the first place. He embodies Kant's thought: ""Give a man everything he desires and yet at that very moment he will feel that this everything is not EVERYTHING."" The parched desert that he wanders, the sky he scans for the soul with lost wings is ever-present in the film. This film is understandably not for everybody. It is a hard lot cast into a jaded marketplace that only finds value in things that are commodified. For those that can withstand the temptation to find agenda where there is none, it will be a worthwhile investment to immerse into a work of art created with a purity of intent.",1490832000,16,2184,4.732283464566929
7380935,3,B01423S8A4,"I've watched Tree of LIfe and To the Wonder as well as Knight of Cups.  I found Tree of LIfe to be a great film but Knight of Cups less so.  It's in the same style as Tree of LIfe but it seemed repetitive--here's yet another scene of the protagonist wandering through life with that lost look on his face, here's yet another scene of him romping on the beach with his latest girlfriend, etc.  The voiceovers in Tree of Life were spare and, while a bit oblique, seemed like appropriate poetic commentaries on the characters' experience; here, the voiceovers are wordier, carrying too much of the narrative, even to the point of sometimes functioning as dialogue.  And they're delivered in that solemn half-whisper that Malick seems to require, which here often seems a bit overdramatic for the content of the words. This film is more verbal than Tree of LIfe, which means it's a bit easier (not easy) to ""get"" the film's themes than it is with Tree of Life, but the visual and cinematic aspects of the film feel less remarkable (though they are nevertheless quite fine).  Sometimes the whole thing starts to feel ponderous, which is something I haven't experienced in a Malick film before.  I could watch Tree of Life any number of times to peel away its layers of meaning, but I don't think I could return to Knight of Cups.  It's a decent Malick film, which means it's better than 90% of what's out there, but not up to his other films.",1490486400,,1437,4.546511627906977

But, like To the Wonder, it isn't really even pretending to have a narrative. Which may be fine for some, but personally I need at least a little bit of plot to fully engage with a film.
The film gives you enough of a sense of the main characters life to kinda-sorta understand why he is with each of these women, but why is he like this? How did he get here? Where is he headed at the end? That's all left utterly open-ended at best. And I understand it's done deliberately, but for me, that's just not enough.
I'd probably get more from a second viewing, but honestly, I'm not interested enough to invest the time.
I'd say this is required viewing for any Malick fan or film student. But if you are new to the director, start with his earlier work and work your way chronologically to his more recent and esoteric & experimental stuff.",1489190400,3,971,4.225806451612903
7380941,4,B01423S8A4,"It's understandable that many viewers, and even many film reviewers, didn't quite take to this picture. It's understandable because times change, viewer's definition of 'cinema' has become distorted by the omnipresence of television and it's ""connect-the-dots"" narrative structure. Yet it is probably no better time to take in the Malick sensibility, an aesthetic that has not changed from his first film ""Badlands"".
 His ideas about life, story, character, and the joy and power of looking have remained consistent. And just as ""Badlands"" confounded so-called 'average' film goers in its time, his recent output confounds people today as well. What's changed is that the so-called average viewer now has more choices in seeing motion pictures especially on television. And they also have more options to make their reactions known. And that is the key, reactions. Commercial movie-making (which includes TV) has always been built on the audience reacting to what was shown and said. A visceral response, repeated and extrapolated, equals success.
 Yet this is not what Cinema is. And it's not a pretense to make the distinction. Just as there are works of literature versus read-once-then-throw-away thrillers, there are movies, films, and cinema. Cinema first and foremost starts with the image. Everything moves from there. To better understand the difference all you have to do is watch something with the sound off. If it works without sound, then it's cinema. And Terrence Malick is a master of the form.
 I would advise anyone to simply take this film on its own terms. Break it up into days even. It is worth the journey because it allows you to see a life from the perspective of a guardian angel. To view a life filled with doubt and hope and regret, and still a willingness to press on. It's a life we all live when we shut off the portable devices and the non-ambient sounds around us.

I couldn't remember anything about it when it came out so I just put it in my Blu ray player and let er rip.  About 10 minutes in, I was thinking that this is just like a movie Terrence Malick would make.  Checking further, it was a Malick movie of course.  Having seen all of his movies going back to his first (1973s Badlands), I always appreciated the beauty of his films.  His last, To the Wonder had me scratching my head however.  Unfortunately this is more of the same, if not even more indecipherable.

Christian Bale is Rick who works in the movie industry, perhaps a screenwriter from what I can tell.  He essentially wanders around throughout the movie, going from house to house, from party to party, from bedroom to bedroom trying to find meaning in his life.  Hes always recognized and always an attention getter from a slew of beautiful women that come in and out of his life.  Most will recognize Cate Blanchett as his ex-wife, a physician, Natalie Portman as a married woman Rick falls for, Freida Pinto, a model, Teresa Palmer a stripper, Imogen Poots, an actress and many others not immediately recognizable.

There are others including his oddly behaving brother Barry (Wes Bentley) who has a constant bone to pick with their father, Joseph (Brian Dennehy) who seems to be slowly losing his mind.  And then there are enough celebrity cameos and walk-ons, which you won't be able to keep up with.  If I haven't crystalized this for you, its because Im not sure what is really going on.  There is very little actual dialog between the actors.  Most comes from the individual characters who do a voice over-narration that is poetic gibberish.

The movies salvation comes from the beautiful pictures that Malick and his cinematographer, Emmanuel Lubezki, present.  The various settings include a wide range of ever-so-seductive visual lures.  The homes and apartments are exquisite, as are the beaches and the mountains.  This is then offset by the gilded excess of Las Vegas or L. A.s dank parking lots and canals.  I don't know what Rick is looking for but I hope he found it.  In the meantime, if you want to see the beauty of the film, just turn off the sound and play any music you enjoy instead, and just watch the pictures.

The Blu ray version of the film comes with a 1080p video resolution and a 2.35:1 aspect ratio.  The video quality is excellent.  As noted above there is a wide range of exterior and interiors shots.  Many, long and leisurely which give the viewer an opportunity to soak it in.  The detail is crisp and sharp without looking artificial.  I could detect no serious visual anomalies.  The audio comes with a DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 track which is also very good.  About the only thing that will wake up your subs is an opening scene earthquake.  Surrounds come to life with the various parties and some environmental content.  Dialog is clear and mostly centered.  Subtitles are available in Spanish and English SDH.  Extras include only a 16 minute making of featurette.",1484352000,,3091,4.696461824953445

7381032,3,B01423S8A4,"I can't attest to the image quality of the disc or any of those factors. It looked gorgeous on my screen and sounded just fine. So no technical aspects will be considered in this review.

One other disclaimer: I am a huge Malick (the director) fan. I have a BA in Philosophy; he was a philosopher before a director. I read and designed my own tarot deck; this movie is based on tarot symbolism. I love his work. I am biased.

That said, this is not his best work. If you are into tarot, it is basically a tarot reading in cinematic form. Each 'chapter' is really a reading of a card in relation to the main character played by Christian Bale. You can read other reviews for a synopsis of what the Bale's character is 'asking' the tarot reader (the audience) for. It's what other reviewers are referring to as plot.

For this, Knight of Cups is a brilliant and haunting movie where we are asked to supply the plot and resolution (almost like a video game asks us to figure out how to play it). Does this work as a movie? Unfortunately, no. Knight of Cups may be captivating, but it is not strictly speaking entertainment (unless you are into this kinda thing, like me). Unlike his other movies, the involvement of the viewer with the main character is slight. There is some element of empathy that gets passed up in the images of the movie. Maybe it's on purpose to keep us 'reading' the images to 'explain' to the main character. Whatever it is, you just don't get emotionally involved with anyone in the movie. There is very little plot or narrative to pull you forward. I do think this lack of plot is intentional as we are supposed to be reading the tarot symbolism, not really telling a story. The end result is up to us.

The entire movie feels more like a conversation with Christian Bale's character than a movie. Again, it's his tarot reading and we are supposed to say to him as we watch, ""This card represents a woman coming into your life that has a perspective on love and intimacy you've never had."" Then we are supposed to point out to him how all these little parts of the pictures come together. It's not something any mainstream viewer will want to do or feel remotely entertained by. Even I was drifting off through my first viewing because it wasn't pulling me toward anything.

Three stars are for the incredible level of creativity, insight, and intellectual brillance the movie has. It just isn't very pleasurable or entertaining on a cinematic level, unlike Malick's other films.",1477440000,,2502,4.5265486725663715

Tree of Life and To The Wonder are both similar in their nature, and if you are fans of those, then you will like Knight of Cups (Though Tree of Life is a better film.)  Only watch this if you know what you are getting yourself into, or if you have watched Tree of Life and are kind of okay with less structure.",1477094400,9,724,4.172661870503597

Apparently it is a Terrence Malick film which means that viewers are in for a lack of reliance on dialogue and still camera shots of character interaction found in most other films. While watching, the viewer is an invisible floating spirit following Christian Bale through his everyday life in Hollywood and LA. Being a ""made-producer"" you see Christian's character interact with all people on screen as someone able to pick up and put back as he chooses, perhaps like they are all cups and he is the ""Knight of Cups"", even like what one character alludes to, that each cup has a flavor of drink inside. I think that this film is an amazing exhibit of exactly all that it is trying to tell, the life of Christian Bale's character in LA and Hollywood which is not entirely smooth for him to deal with. The film goes through his afflictions and his anxieties which can be felt while watching. I felt a sense of tension in his character the entire movie and I was able to feel when characters alleviated that tension for him as well.

7381162,5,B01423S8A4,"Is the highly gifted and extremely innovative director Terrence Malick testing us? Is he experimenting through his latest films to see how far he can transform cinema expectations before losing the audience? Thisis the most abstract film I have seen and the only films that come near it are late Godard, Peter Greenaway and other Malick films. The camera floats through an oceanic flow of settings, some densely populated, others only one or two characters, with superimposed mental monologues bumping into snatches of dialogue, but none of it seemingly prioritized or clarified. Dramatic pacing is sacrificed for a dream-like perception of consciousness. This film seems to be a series of soul-states, that unfold over time, as the Everyman character, played with remarkable intelligence and empathy by Christian Bale (Bravo!), endures a rather late in life crisis of identity and purpose.  There are several embraces and apparent reconciliations at the very end, but no great moment of epiphany to suggest this experience has reached closure. H-o-w-e-v-e-r, I was mesmerized for the duration of two hours, I was continually awed by Malick's settings and use of them to reveal character, and his disembodied
monologue/dialogue reached me with surprising clarity. Malick is the Master of Abstract Film, which eliminates the dramatic details and presents instead a distillation of psychic details. We are the sum total of our thoughts, feelings, desires, gripes, obsessions, loves and hates. We think our way through the physical world. Reality isn't
real, it's a labyrinth of interiority, a web of desires. And it's brilliant and gripping.",1474156800,8,1639,5.377431906614786
7381163,1,B01423S8A4,"A copy of this title was provided for review purposes.

Seriously. This is the worst movie Ive seen all year. It might be one of the worst movies Ive ever seen in my 58 years on Earth. I watched and watched, start to finish, I wanted to find something I liked about it. And when the end credits rolled I found nothing to like. Yes the cinematography was well done but thats about the only nice thing I can bring myself to say.

Know this going in: there is no plot. This movie is a series of random acts with a single character as the focal point and thats about it. I had to look up the credits at imdb.com to find out the name of the main character. By the way its Rick and hes played by Christian Bale.

So in trying to piece together what I watched, Bale is a scriptwriter (at least I think he is) who goes from one spot to another, to parties, to clubs, to the streets of LA, to the beach. He gets involved with various women who accompany him from one location to the next where he then encounters another and leaves the first behind. He is robbed, he is beaten, he waxes poetic about his life. But nothing happens. I know part of this is just me. I like a film to tell a story, to have a narrative that moves me from point A to point Z, a journey that takes me from one spot in a story to a finale. This film does nothing like that.

Director Terence Malik has been hailed as one of the most artistic directors of his time. Great. Fine. I loved THE TREE OF LIFE. I enjoyed THE THIN RED LINE and THE NEW WORLD. TREE also didn't use the straight narrative that most movies do but at least it had a form to it, a beginning, a middle and an end. This movie just feels like we dropped into the midst of nothing happening and went through nothing.

I read reviews of this movie and some have summed it up perfectly. One said that it was a 2 hour commercial for nothing. I felt that exact same way. Then I read others where people were discussing the depth of the movie using terms that felt so pretentious I felt as if whoever was writing them was doing so not to give an honest review of the movie but to make themselves appear as if they were deep thinkers. Those type of people tend to be full of themselves and always trying to rise above the rest of us poor cretins who simply want to be entertained or told a story. They find psychological meanings in something as simple as how one holds a spoon or fork while eating. They contemplate their navels as if the secrets to the universe can be found there. In short in an attempt to appear wise and knowledgeable they refuse to tell the Emperor that hes not wearing any clothes, instead discussing the finery of the material he is wearing instead.

Yes I watched this movie all the way through. It was a struggle. At least twice I found myself dozing off so I backed the movie up to the last scene I remembered and started it there again. By the end I was angry. Angry that I had taken up over 2 hours of my life to watch this film. Angry that I had been duped by the marvelous movie that was THE TREE OF LIFE into believing this movie could possibly be as good. It was the furthest thing from it.

This was the sort of movie that people who found the Andy Warhol film EMPIRE to be an artistic masterpiece. If you don't know the movie was over 8 hours of a static camera shooting the Empire State building. This movie is as boring but different in that it never sits still. The camera is always moving. If you suffer from motion sickness I implore you, steer clear of this film.

I watched the extras as well, few of them that there were, and discovered another item to make explain why this movie was so bad. Malik didn't always give the actors dialogue to speak. He basically set up the situation and told them to come up with their own, to speak as the character they were playing. Of course the actors ate this up and felt that he trusted them to bring something to the project, that he provided them with the creative freedom to be a part of this artistic endeavor. Note to all actors: there is a reason you are an actor and not a writer; there is a reason why you are hired to perform the words that are written for you rather than to write the screenplay. The fact that many of you say some of the most ridiculous things when a microphone is placed in front of you on the red carpet should be a clue that creating dialogue is not your forte. Stick with acting, let a writer make you look good.

This piece has gone on too long. From the movie I watched there is more written here than there was to this movie prior to it being filmed. I don't hate Terence Malik for making this movie or for robbing me of 2 hours of my life. But the next time I see his name attached to a film I will think twice before watching it. The fact that the movie never received a major release that Im aware of becomes obvious after watching it. While movies made by business executives concerned only with the bottom line and the chance to build a franchise make me ill this is the other end of the extreme, a movie made to represent artistic endeavor while offering nothing for the majority of film goers out there. Had I paid $10 for a ticket to see this movie I would have been arguing with the manager afterward. This is a move that people should be paid to watch and even then they would be ripped off.",1473811200,16,5345,4.151544401544402

7381171,5,B01423S8A4,"One piece of advice: watch it at least twice. Like ""To the Wonder"" and ""Tree of Life"", there are layers of meaning that are revealed in each subsequent viewing. In fact, one does not really watch Terence Malik movies; one contemplates them. Here we have, firstly, a man whose vacuousness and perhaps narcissism--seemingly learned from his father--cannot summon the depth to properly enter into any substantive relationship with a woman. Even though he knows it to be his deepest desire--to love and be loved, to belong--he keeps missing the mark and (willfully) misunderstanding what is required of him. Secondly, we have the women whom Malik presents as embodiments of the beautiful, in so many different and complex types of beauty: from physical to spiritual. Female beauty is the only driving force experienced in the protagonist's life. Malik is telling the tale from the perspective of this man's soul. More generally, it seems to us to be a meditation on the human soul's struggle to free itself from its own solitude. Malik seems to be showing us how much each of us yearns for communion--and how easily we can miss it.",1472169600,14,1127,4.936842105263158

Having read a number of online reviews, however, I was preparing myself for something excruciating. The end of a love affair even. I needn't have worried. Knight of Cups is a vast improvement on To The Wonder which I consider his least impressive work. Minutes into the film I realised I was enjoying being back in the World of Malick magic. I realised all the negative reviews are the opinions of those who are yet (if ever) to understand and appreciate what can best be described as the Malick 'Canon.' You cannot approach a Malick film like that of any other Director. Not even the improvisational looseness of a Robert Altman film comes near. Terrence Malick has boldly taken film making into new territory, a whole new dimension even. To approach one of his films like you would a conventional moving picture would be like reading a poem and expecting it to read like a novel. In Knight of Cups, like much of Malick's work, he writes visual, moving picture poetry. Just sit back and let it wash over you. Be enchanted by the imagery, the soundscape, the music, and allow the words to enter your subconscious. Allow your emotional reaction to the stimuli write your own narrative. Use your imagination to put it all together.  Knight of Cups is a fine piece of Malick. If you hold it up to yourself for the one hour and fifty minutes duration and are left feeling empty, bored and frustrated, well, I suspect that says more about you than this film. It is not a membership to some exclusive club, either, to be one who loves Malick. The joys are open to everyone willing to open their hearts, minds and emotions and receive the beauty on offer. Dislike it if you wish, reconsider it if you dare. Let me state, I am not a religious person, not a believer, but I sense and appreciate immense spiritual qualities in all Malick films.

As an example, compare the following two quotes:

The first by Father Quintana in To The Wonder

""We wish to live inside the safety of the laws. We fear to choose. Jesus insists on choice. The one thing he condemns utterly is avoiding the choice. To choose is to commit yourself. And to commit yourself is to run the risk, is to run the risk of failure, the risk of sin, the risk of betrayal. But Jesus can deal with all of those. Forgiveness he never denies us. The man who makes a mistake can repent. But the man who hesitates, who does nothing, who buries his talent in the earth, with him he can do nothing.""

The next by the disembodied voice in The Knight of Cups:

""Once the soul was perfect and had wings, it could sour into haven that only creatures with wings can be. But the soul lost its wings and fell to earth where it took a earthly body, now, while it lives in this body no outward sign of wings can be seen yet the roots of its wings are still there... and we see a beautiful woman or a man, the soul remembers the beauty it used to know in haven, and begins to spout and that makes the soul want to fly but it cannot yet it is still too weak so that man keeps staring up to the sky at a young bird, he lost all interest in the world around...""

The first is a profoundly moving, important sentiment that crystalized the themes of To The Wonder.  It's interesting and thought-provoking and (given the context of the speaker in the film), incredibly regretful and sad.  It's just perfect.

The second is just silly avant garde garbage.  It doesn't mean a darn thing.  It's like something that girl in college that all of us knew would say after a couple of drinks.  And like with that girl, you kinda scrunch your nose at Malick and try to figure out if there is anything what is being said, until you realize it's doesn't mean a darn thing... Just the self-satisfying ramblings of people who think a little too much of themselves.

..and not for nothing.  Having Christian Bale wander around scenes without saying anything is not profound or artistic (or even effective in ham-handedly telegraphing his alienation and remove from the chaos around him).  It just make him seem like one of those guys who was brain-damaged by getting hit by a golfball to the head when he was a toddler.

Malick has definitely started believing his own press releases.  He needs to get back to the humility and innovation that created one of the most diehard fanbases in Hollywood, cause this aint it.

One last note, the music in Knight of Cups is just as good as other Malick pieces and contains a lot of new and interesting pieces.  Regardless of how you feel about the movie, go visit iTunes to take a listen.  Some of it is just wonderful.",1468454400,10,2997,4.402903811252268
7381203,4,B01423S8A4,"Writer/director Terrence Malick is Terrence Malick and either you relate to his films or avoid them. They are art pieces: not all art appeals to everyone. His films are an expression of a philosophy that the mind constructs all the input the eyes see and the body feels and while it may not make a story that is easy to follow (is there really anything to follow in any of his films?) it provides a unique experience that requires the viewer to relinquish expectations of storytelling and simply sail through the visual magnificence of the images Malick places on the screen and populates with enough characters to offer a hand during the journey he has shared.

Try to piece together a definition of the story and it comes in two levels: 1) A 30 year old writer (Rick  Christian Bale) indulging in all that Los Angeles and Las Vegas has to offer undertakes a search for love and self via a series of adventures with six different women. And 2) A fable  Once there was a young prince whose father, the king of the East, sent him down into Egypt to find a pearl. But when the prince arrived, the people poured him a cup. Drinking it, he forgot he was the son of a king, forgot about the pearl and fell into a deep sleep. The sections of the film are named according to Tarot Cards.

The dialogue is mostly off camera (with notable exceptions) and offers some sensitive philosophical notes that accompany the photography and the essentially classical music score that illuminates the film. The dialogue counts: Joseph (Brian Dennehy) is the main character Ricks father and states You think when you reach a certain age things will start making sense, and you find out that you are just as lost as you were before. I suppose that's what damnation is. The pieces of your life never to come together, just splashed out there. And there are many memorable lines  You live in a little fantasy world, don't you?  Treat this world as it deserves, there are no principles, just circumstances. Nobody's home. All those years, living the life of someone I didn't even know. No one cares about reality anymore.

The cast, even if through very brief appearances, is uniformly excellent  Christian Bale, Cate Blanchett, Brian Dennehy, Natalie Portman, Antonio Banderas, Freida Pinto, Wes Bentley, Imogen Poots, Armin Mueller-Stahl, Cherry Jones, Jason Clarke, and too many others to credit. The magnificent cinematography is by Emmanuel Lubecki and the musical score montage is credited to Hanan Townshend.

Perhaps not a film for everyone, but for those who wish to expand their visual and philosophical horizons, set sail with Knight of Cups. Grady Harp, July 16",1468454400,10,2649,4.7789934354485775
7381204,3,B01423S8A4,"Beautifully shot but ultimately confusing this slice of life drama shares more with David Lynch than with conventional storytelling. If stream-of-consciousness experimental style films are your cup of tea, you'll enjoy this but it takes a lot of patience and a pretty open mind. Terrence Malick has always been an iconoclast and a visionary, but you must suspend expectation and have an open mind in order to appreciate. I was awe-struck by the imagery and imaginative filmmaking techniques but left cold by the characters, who all seemed very unfeeling and self-centered, which I believe was the point but a bit unsettling.",1468454400,,624,5.188118811881188

Christian Bale is a great actor but this film simply had no story line at all. It is a swirl of imagery & sounds without (to me) meaning.
I've watched 100s of ""art films"" & realize this is an art film. But it's not really worth watching since nothing happens, no character development (that I can see).
I read an interview with Christian Bale about this movie. (""For each and every scene I didn't know what I was going to be doing each and every day. But he would like [makes torpedo explosion sound] and push me and it was a notion of lets see what happens.) So obviously, there was no script. Just random imagery.
I'm sorry. I generally love Malick films but not this one!",1468368000,2,838,4.378205128205129
7381206,5,B01423S8A4,"Terrence Malick occupies a very special place in the history of cinema in the United States. After directing two well-received films in the seventies (Badlands, 1973; Days of Heaven, 1978), he faded out for twenty years, in which he did other things, like, for example, teaching philosophy in France. In 1998 he returned with the successful The Thin Red Line, then faded out for eight years, and reappeared in 2005 with the fascinating The New World. And it is the 2000s where Malick has been working almost non-stop, as producer and director. Knight of Cups, one of his recent efforts, exquisitely and colorfully captures life, as only Malick is capable of -- you know, with his very particular vision of things.

If I have to describe Knight of Cups, I would just say that it is a visually poetic homage to the city of Los Angeles, as well as to Las Vegas, two cities four hours away from each other, yet each one embodies the emptiness of the human condition in a sea of luxury and money. This emptiness is reflected in Rick (Christian Bale), a screenwriter, who despite his success, is missing that something that sometimes eludes us, that something that causes men and women to live a life of excess and addiction. In this case, Rick is constantly partying, having relationships with assorted women (Freida Pinto, Teresa Palmer, Imogen Poots, Isabel Lucas), including his ex-wife (Cate Blanchett), and conflicting with his father (Brian Dennehy) and brother (Wes Bentley). One of these ladies may be the one that helps him see the light.

As in any Malick film, the cinematography takes a primordial seat, and here we enjoy the award-winning work of Emmanuel Lubezki, who captures the spirit of cities of Los Angeles and Las Vegas in all their splendor and decadence. If you are able to separate the background images, the silences (almost a total lack of dialogue, mostly narration), the vast spaces (sense of space, as Malick has been quoted), and glue all these things together, you will perhaps understand or figure what the director was trying to accomplish here. It is definitely a testament to our times. The Blu-ray includes a making-of documentary. (USA, 2014, color, 118 min plus additional materials).

Those who only care about plot, dialogue, acting, and character development need not bother because there honestly isn't much.  It's about a rich screenwriter having an existential crisis in his family and romantic connections.  But even Robert Altman and Michael Mann were never able to capture the personality of L.A. (and the Western USA generally) on such an epic, dreamy, and majestic scale.  My major gripe is that Malick has almost completely abandoned camera tripods, dolly tracks, and cranes.  Instead, he uses a lot of fast edits, close ups, pans, zooms, and walking shots just like in his last three films.  Perhaps some viewers don't notice, but it really pulls me out of the experience to be CONSTANTLY aware that the camera is there.

Gorgeous cinematography of the location shots all over Los Angeles and Las Vegas.  This would be great to throw on a screen in the background at a party with other music playing over it.  While watching this I muttered, ""Maybe one needs to be stoned to be pulled into this.  Nah, this will likely kill their buzz.""

Christian Bale plays the lead character, but the lead character of what?  He meanders through one lushly photographed landscape after another looking up pensively, then down, then off into the distance as if watching his own movie from the living room couch.  There's a saying that says you can watch a gifted actor read the phone book and you'd be entertained.  One could put actors Christian Bale and Cate Blanchett on that list.  This movie will test that theory, because I wonder if that rule doesn't always apply.

I typically like films that most don't like, and I like art house independent films, so I thought it's possible I would like this.  But I couldn't figure out what this movie was about or what the point was.  If you try hard enough to focus on this piece, then you may get somewhere.  Two stars was about all I could muster. I eventually got to the point of this, but by that time I no longer cared.

I loved the cast and they made this watchable, but I wonder if while they were filming these scenes they weren't secretly wondering, ""Why did I agree to this?""  It was said that Christian Bale signed onto this without having read a script.  Once you sign that contract you're legally required to fulfill that requirement of acting in the film.  Perhaps it was too late and they all just made the most of it.  That's what I did while watching this.  I made the most of it and will likely not ever do that again.  But give it a shot.

The Tree of Life, another almost impossibly beautiful film, started his turn to conceptual art. In this genre the artist is more concerned with experimenting with personal ideas and techniques than in communicating anything to the audience. The Tree of Life is intensely personal as is To the Wonder, and in Knight of Cups Malick returns again to his obsession with his brother's suicide and his ambivalent feelings about women. He is at once almost excessively attracted to their allure, but feels this is shallow and somehow ignoble. As so often has happened, conceptual art turns into surrealism and then into Dada. This is what has happened here. A film with no dialogue, once again most stunningly photographed, and completely incomprehensible to his audience, Those that claim to see any real plot or idea development here are responding to a video Rorschach ink  blot test.

The characters in this film seem detached from one another, they seem like actors rehearsing but not with each other but rather independently, although they share the same scenes in this film with Christian Bale who plays Rick. All the actors in this film are for the most part in some kind of trance like dance as they walk in circles around each other while reciting their lines as if this film were a stage play.

I would retitle this film Dazed and Confused  for Rick the lead character in this film acts as though he is stoned or high on drugs, Rick is a writer who has affairs with many gorgeous women in this film. Yet Ricks love scenes are all repetitious. Rick swirls around in some kind of a dance as he chases the women as though it was his first fling. While watching this film you wonder is Rick mentally challenged? For he acts like it. There are many repeated scenes of him walking on top of rooftops, on the beach, then he stares up at helicopters and airplanes overhead,  as though he had never seen one before. When other people talk to him, all he does is offer them the same bland smile, hardly speaking at all. After watching the entire film, you still haven't got a clue who Rick is. There is some beautiful cinematography but with the lack of a screenplay story it is all wasted.

When I watched the DVDs special features I found out more than the film had to offer. Here the actors confessed that Director Malick wanted each to to show up on the film set, they were given no lines to speak for there was no SCRIPT FOR THIS FILM!!  It was all improvisation. In other words nobody knew what the hell they were dong including director Malick.  This film makes a bold statement of just how important screenplays are for a film.

1.  Ambient sounds are in the foreground while almost inaudible dialog goes on.  I blasted the sound and still wondered what the @#$% they were saying nearly all the time.

2.  The viewing aspect ratio is distorted no matter which display mode I used.  People did not look natural people.  The movie is advertised as 2.35 to 1 (super wide screen) but I kept thinking ""what the @#$% is wrong with this disorienting view"".

After a while I realized they used a funky lens, likely something that distorts into a trapezoid shape and fisheye effects.  I hated it.

3.  There was absolutely no intelligent dialog nor story nor tie to the visuals.  I never understood what was going on (because there is nothing to understand).  I never gave a @#$% about what was happening.  I had no emotional investment in the ""hero"" at all.

Why did I give it one star instead of zero?  Because Amazon won't let me give zero.  And to be fair, there were moments of beautiful and artistic landscapes.

7381241,2,B01423S8A4,"Knight of Cups follows writer Rick (Christian Bale) on an odyssey through the hedonistic pleasures of Los Angeles and Las Vegas as he searches for both love and a sense of purpose. His quest takes him to mansions, resorts, beaches, and clubs as he struggles over complex relationships with his brother, Barry (Wes Bentley), and father (Brian Dennehy). Longing to break his self-imposed prison of disenchantment, Rick seeks adventures with six women: rebellious Della (Imogen Poots); his physician ex-wife, Nancy (Cate Blanchett); Helen (Freida Pinto), a model; Elizabeth (Natalie Portman), a woman he wronged in the past; playful stripper Karen (Teresa Palmer); and innocent Isabel (Isabel Lucas).

Director Terrence Malick created his best work in the 1970s with Badlands and Days of Heaven. Since then, however, he has veered from traditional storytelling, replacing it with striking imagery but annoying voiceovers and the barest of plots wrapped in stylistic film flam. If Knight of Cups were a thesis for a film major, it might be tolerable. When you're Malick, however, using the film medium to foist a curious, confusing vision on moviegoers is sheer self-indulgence.

Christian Bale, who has proved his acting ability many times over in films with a solid story and well drawn characters, meanders through the picture looking lost and out-of-touch. Malick has him look off dramatically at nothing in particular, perhaps in an attempt to convey depth and significance where there are none. Despite its impressive cast, the movie lumbers along, seemingly endless. With no real plot to latch onto and a central character who is more a philosophical statement than a real human being, Knight of Cups, rated R, is a disappointment.

Maybe it's that Malick is making movies solely for himself to enjoy, but if that's the case could he please keep them locked away in an attic somewhere like a reasonable person would do?

""Knight of Cups"" once again features a man pondering the meaning of his life or something. And in Malick's world, this can only be accomplished by having Rick (Christian Bale) wandering around on beaches while the waves crash, hanging out in empty office buildings, and dilly-dallying with a number of hot women, each with less personality than the last. But then nobody really has any personality, they're too nebulous for that, Malick's narrative too shapeless to allow for such things.

It's not right to say that he has no idea what he's doing; he seems to have a rough idea of what he wants. It would be nice if he'd let us all in on what he's seeing, though. Rick glides wordlessly through L.A., mimicking mimes and hanging out with celebs. He's a man who is in show business, and that apparently has some impact on his life....just how isn't very clear. He meets a lot of famous people who pop up in meaningless cameos (Malick cut out like dozens more), and there's the suggestion that maybe that pointlessness is what Malick is trying to capture. Maybe. But then he clearly wants the women in Rick's life to have greater resonance, and yet they are of little value to cluing us in to Rick's dilemma.

While the passage of time seems irrelevant here, the film is divided into sections loosely centered on Rick's relationships. Wes Bentley plays Rick's brother, who harbors anger at their father (Brian Dennehy) for past wrongs. Cate Blanchett plays Rick's ex-wife, a doctor who cares for the physically deformed. Her interaction

with one disfigured man are like something from a completely different movie. Natalie Portman is a married woman Rick has an affair with; Teresa Palmer plays a vivacious young stripper, Freida Pinto is a supermodel he meets at a party, and then there's Imogen Poots and Isabel Lucas who just drift in and out of the film looking gorgeous but not adding much else.

Some will try to convince you Malick should be forgiven because, darnit, his images have such a poetic beauty to them, and if you look hard enough meaning can be found in them. That's, respectfully, a bunch of hooey. First of all, the credit for the film's visual artistry goes to cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki, who has been behind the camera for most of Malick's work. Second, while we can all appreciate the sight of beautiful people gallivanting under L.A.'s sun-kissed skies, there's little meaning to Bale wandering around mumbling about palm trees...which is a thing he actually does.

It's been suggested there's an autobiographical aspect that loosely connects Malick's recent films, and if that's the case then he really needs to get a life, one that will make a better movie.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Knight-of-Cups/dp/B01423S8A4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Knight of Cups</a>",1463788800,2,3520,5.0085470085470085
7381246,5,B01423S8A4,"I am an avid Terrence Malick fan. When I discovered that I could buy a copy of Knight of Cups from Germany before I could see it in the States, I jumped on it. I even bought a region-free DVD player so I may watch it. I am glad I did. As usual, my first viewing was done so I could let the story unfold and I can let the visual poetry flow through me. After my first viewing I was floored by the emotion that dripped from every frame. It is refreshing to see a character reflect on past loves and think about how they influenced the man the character eventually becomes at the end of the film. In this film, there is no betrayal or lamentations of lost love; it is an honest look at how relationships can shape our lives. When Rick, Christian Bale's character, finally finds peace, I too felt that feeling. I am not ashamed to admit that this film has helped me see the beauty of past loves and what they have done, without realizing it, to lead me to where I am today.",1463270400,11,969,4.105263157894737

7381248,3,B01423S8A4,"Ive spent 30 years not living a life. Of ruining it, for myself and others. I cant remember the man I wanted to be. Rick (Bale) has lost himself and is looking for something to wake him up. He hopes to find it in LA and Las Vegas. During his journey he meets six different women, all of whom give him a different experience. This will be a short review, for one reason. I wasn't smart enough to understand this movie. I did expect that going in because this is a Terrence Malick movie and his movies are so deep and metaphorical, which is really just past my level of intelligence apparently. The movie did have some great acting and was beautiful to watch. His movies are basically works of art, but the meaning is usually lost on me. If you are a fan of Malick than you will enjoy this. If, like me, he is usually a little over your head then you know what to expect from this. Overall, a movie that I cant really tell if its good or bad because I didn't understand it. I give it a B-.",1462060800,6,987,4.119170984455959

7381250,1,B01423S8A4,"Remember that old Simpsons episode when Homer becomes Mr Plow and pays a heap of money to some advertising company to make a TV commercial to promote his Mr Plow business and when it aired as some arty nonsense flashing between scenes or people singing and smashing a snow globe and scenery and interiors of buildings that had nothing to do with plowing snow, then Bart or someone asked him if that was his commercial and he answered in a baffled voice ""I don't know"".  Well that's pretty much what Knight of Cups is.  There is no storyline with this thing, you just follow some guy played by Christian Bale who stumbles around in an out of it type daze through various locations, bedding a few different women along the way.  There is the occasional bit of dialogue every now and then but no one is really having a conversation to the extent of telling a story.  Instead you've got piano and other elevator music playing throughout the whole film (if that's the word you want to use to describe what this is).

This movie will attract a lot of viewers as it does have a lot of actors. So hence people who are fans or like their work and want to see everything they are in will check this out.  But they appear like extras do in a real movie, they are in a group at a party, they are in the foyer of an office building.  There's heaps of big names that appear for a few seconds but that's it.

To make matters worse, this thing goes for two hours but if you start watching this one with a group of people, it's unlikely there will be one or two still in the room at the hour mark, let alone the two.",1461110400,7,1599,4.2368421052631575
7381251,4,B01423S8A4,"Nine Things About the Film ""Knight of Cups""

1. Visionary director Terrence Malick has out-Malicked himself with this movie. It's not a good way to introduce yourself to this director. It's his most abstract movie, and the hardest to get into.

2. The title of the film refers to the Tarot card of the same name, and most of the chapters in the movie are named after Tarot cards. If you know the meanings of the cards, it helps unlock some of the symbolism of the movie.

3. I won't bother trying to explain all the layers of what it's about. This is partly because I'm not totally sure myself, and partly because it's an impressionistic film, so it's really not my place to interpret it for you. You can find other articles that wax philosophic about What It Means.

4. The movie is basically a stream-of-consciousness drama about a guy named Rick who writes movies in Hollywood. He feels so alienated from his life that he has no idea what to do. He meets people (or flies them to visit him), in the hopes of finding some grounding, some direction, but it doesn't work.

5. It's also about the false grandeur of celebrity life. It makes Hollywood and Las Vegas look beautiful but corroded, covering the horrors of life. The images are acid that eat at your heart. As one character says in the movie ""Drinking is bad, but feelings are worse."" Another character says ""My life is like playing Call of Duty on easy mode."" The movie makes you wonder if the fragile, ugly glamour of celebrity culture also applies to regular people.

6. Yes the movie stars Christian Bale (and a bunch of other people), but do not - I repeat, do not - go to see the movie just because you are a Christian Bale fan. He doesn't do much except wander through cities, Hollywood parties, and nature landscapes, not talking. Bale was actually not even given a script, which forced him to improvise most of his lines when characters did speak to him.

7. There is not very much dialogue at all in the movie. Most of it is done with Malick's trademark narrative voice-overs, mumbled softly by characters, and which may or may not have anything to do with what you're seeing on screen.

8. The director of photography for the film is Emmanuel Lubezki, one of the best cinematographers in the world. If enjoying camera work is your thing, it's possible to give up trying to understand the film and just enjoy the artistic presentation of the images. It's that beautiful.

9. It's entirely understandable that a lot of people will not like this film. There is zero action. There is zero sex. I don't even remember if anybody really swears. Many will find this movie too pretentious and impossible to understand. But part of Malick's genius is that he doesn't care. He doesn't make movies for mass audiences. This is a super intimate, personal meditation on life that is both beautiful and painful. If you can surrender to his work, he will put you in a trance so that what you don't understand with your mind, you may understand in a deeper place.",1459123200,95,3015,4.55822550831793
8729366,3,B01423S8A4,"Terrence Malick films will always get a lot of bad ratings because the average person will not understand his aesthetic.  Then there will be a few people who will be blown away, like the movie is completely groundbreaking, even though Malick and others have done this aesthetic countless times before.  I don't really get tired of the style.  I like the meditative quality.  I like really paying attention to the visuals, and catching how they may be symbolic, even if they seem happenstance.  BUT this film was a bit gratuitous.  with the scrawny naked chics.  with the dancing around like little cherubs.  The main character really couldve had 2-3 less flings, and you still wouldve gotten the point.  He also doesnt seem to learn, change, or progress much throughout the film, which I think is unusual for a Malick character.",1535500800,,828,4.857142857142857

Bale takes you  on a journey with depth. You cannot take it literally nor can you slander it either. It has a documentary feel to it.  There are so many great actors in it and it throws you into a rabbit hole (Alice in wonderland feel to it). Strange but shot really well.
