8170040,4,B000MMLPFA,"I was bored and running out of cash at the time. The only anime I didn't have that I could afford was Air Gear. Air Gear is a pretty good show. I was quite surprised. It's more of an anime about beating up street gangs who just happen to ride roller blades with electric motors in them. I used to ride roller blades in middle school but I never associated it with being tough. These guys and girls really stick it to each other.

The main character, Ikki, lives with a family of sisters. He is a delinquent in a street gang. One day he finds a pair of ""At's"" in one of his housemates rooms. The story is about him climbing to the top of the AT battle world with his friends.

This series has a lot to offer. It has action, comedy, drama, and a bit of romance. Not as much as Ikki would like though. The animation is good and so is the soundtrack. It has a different kind vibe to it. It's very pop culture oriented and there is a descent amount of fan service. My only complaint with this one is that the whole roller blade thing is kind of lame. It's a bit of a strange premise to base an anime on. Even though the series is pretty entertaining, I wouldn't call it extremely memorable. There are many more animes out that are way better. If you've seen everything else go ahead and watch Air Gear, but check it out on Netflix or Youtube before you drop $20 on it.",1354665600,,1363,4.120300751879699
8170041,5,B000MMLPFA,A great series and excellent edition to any collector of anime and anime fantantic. I loved the second dvd and the fact it comes with the box is even better. Now I can add all the dvd in one box and the art work is great. Its a bit pricey but you get the great dvd which is worth it alone and the box to keep adding to the series take my word for it you will love it.,1189814400,2,367,3.6582278481012658
8170042,5,B000MMLPFA,"The second edition of the air gear series is a must buy since the characters get more fleshed out and the story line continues to expand and get more complex. If you love Trigun, outlaw star, or even gundam seed. You know they start out expanding the characters and series and air gear is no exception. I loved watching it and the battles were superb. Its worth every dollar and you won't be disapointed.",1189814400,,404,4.472972972972973
