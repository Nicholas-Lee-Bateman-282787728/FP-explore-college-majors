8325915,4,B000Y3EZQI,"I ordered this DVD because Lucille Younge who played White Fawn was my great aunt.  It was the first movie Pathe made in USA.  The film was shot in New Jersey.  The photography was typical of era, a stationary camera with actors performing in front of it.  Actors used panomine.  After the tribe believes White Fawn was killed by her husband, there are several chase scenes including cliffs and a river with strong currents.  It is a must see for those interested in the history of the film industry.  I wish the packaging for it had still shots from the film.  Lucille Younge suicide scene was gracefully performed.",1406851200,,616,4.638888888888889
