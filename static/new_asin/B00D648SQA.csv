8589814,3,B00D648SQA,"I consider this 1999 BBC production wonderfully entertaining, second only to the more popular ""Pride and Prejudice."" (The excellent screenwriter, Andrew Davies, is shared by both.)

The good news about this Blu-ray pressing from Spain is that, unlike the DVD editions released in the U.S., it's in the 16:9 aspect ratio that entirely fills your HDTV screen.

The bad news is that the picture quality is problematic. There is a lot (and I do mean a lot) of jaggedness to edges and a general blurriness in anything but close-ups. Instead of remastering the source material for high definition, it appears an attempt was made to boost the DVD-quality master for Blu-ray purposes.

The 2.0 sound is not impressive, but it serves its purpose. There are no bonus features, which is a shame, since previous DVD releases in the U.S. and abroad had several.

Still, I'm glad to have this disc as a stopgap. Here's hoping a truly remastered version with all the bonus features is released eventually.",1424649600,4,990,4.910179640718563
