3090906,5,B0012KK6R4,"This is a great workout that is definitely geared toward an intermediate to advanced practitioner, at bare minimum a beginner with a high degree of flexibility.  Even the beginner flow (39 min long) includes some poses that you may not get the first time you try the DVD. There are 2 other flows that are 70 and 71 minutes respectively.  These flows provide a great mix of beginner, intermediate, and advance poses done in a flow that will more than likely make you sweat. The DVD also includes a section with 20 or so poses that gets very detailed about how to enter and hold the poses.  Overall the DVD quality is good and the instructor is excellent.  I would suggest at least several years of experience before trying this DVD unless you have a gymnastics, a dance background, or a good enough understanding of yoga to otherwise be able to modify some of the poses to suit your level.",1222214400,19,888,4.53125
3090907,5,B0012KK6R4,This is a very good DVD. High production quality. Comftirble 45 intermediate routine and two long chalenging intermed/advanced routines that are based on the gradual strengh and flexibility development of each routine. Great for intermed/adv yoga practioners.,1219795200,,259,6.027027027027027
3090908,4,B0012KK6R4,this is a good yoga for beginners to intermediate. she does not have a lot of variation to the sequences. there's are tons of downdog leg lifts in this so you may get tired of them. especially in the hour long ones. a few different poses that will make you work.,1211846400,7,262,4.1568627450980395
3090909,5,B0012KK6R4,"For people past beginner and ready for more of a challenge, i strongly recommend this DVD.  A beginner could certainly enjoy it as well, but to participate in all of the movements, more experience is necessary.  It's a nice flowing sequence in all three sessions.  One is 39 minutes and the other two 70 minutes.  I enjoy her soothing voice and gentle approach to the movements.  Enjoy!",1210809600,2,386,4.701492537313433

The poses are standard like updog, downdog, cobra, etc., but it is the way they are done that brings the calmness. There are some advanced poses like: standing bound angle which can be a challenge but who doesn't want a challenge, now & again? I am delighted with this DVD.",1204588800,10,378,4.478260869565218

3090941,5,B0012KK6R4,I've been enjoying this DVD for several months. I've followed all three programs but gravitate back to B. I love the flows. They are energizing for the body while calming to the mind. I love the focus on the hips and balancing postures. The cueing was a little confusing the first time thru but after many times of practicing the cueing is not a problem. I also appreciate the pose guide. Deb is a wonderful teacher for those of us who practice exclusively at home.,1339632000,,465,4.482352941176471
3090942,5,B0012KK6R4,"I've been practicing yoga for about 6 years and have taught a few classes, and this is one of my favorite DVDs.  I only do the third practice, so I can't really review the first two.
This video has an excellent variety of poses and an awesome flow and progression.  One thing that I don't like is that it doesn't give you much time to loosen up before going right into high lunges, twists, and standing splits, so I just do some forward folds and cat/cows or whatever I need before starting it.  However it makes up for that by having an excellent cool-down at the end with therapeutic side stretches and forward bends.  As I said, the progression is amazing; I love how she builds up with the standing pose series so that you are adequately prepared for all of the poses that come.  This is the DVD I always pop in when my body or mind is feeling lousy and I need something I can rely on to make me feel 100xs better.
The sequence is challenging yet relaxing.  It has a lot of emphasis on hip-opening postures.  It's a flow practice, so if you're looking for something that holds poses for a long time I would recommend Bryan Kest's Power Yoga series.",1309305600,2,1152,4.330232558139535
3090943,5,B0012KK6R4,"This is currently my favorite yoga DVD. I find this vinyasa to be a great complement to my running routine. The instruction is low key. The scenery is beautiful. I try to do the full 70 minute vinyasa, but am glad to have the 40 minute routine available as a back up when I am pressed for time.

One comment: this routine is definitely not for beginners...you must be familiar with vinyasa flow prior to attempting this workout. Which is actually one of the reasons I love it so much...no time wasted with explanations...you get to just get down to business!",1308700800,,558,4.524752475247524
3090944,5,B0012KK6R4,"I am a beginning yoga practitioner; I've been at this about four weeks.  When I started, I could barely bend over and touch the floor.  I purchased several yoga DVDs for variety.  This is by far one of my favorites.  I think it's because I have a real feeling of achievement and well-being when I do the programs.  The first time I could do the forward splits fully, without putting my hands on the floor, I was so proud I forgot to proceed to the next posture!  I just wanted to stay there and gloat.  Not very yogi-ish, eh?

But Ms Dobbin leads one through the poses in such a way that you really find your power and flexibility and are *able* to do the poses.  I have a few DVDs that do not properly flex and warm the body and by the time they hit the harder poses, you just aren't there.  (Power Yoga with Rodney Yee is another great DVD that seems to do things in a flow that appropriately prepares one for the succeeding poses.  By the time the bridge pose comes along, you can actually do the bridge pose.)

I will admit Ms Dobbin's fidgeting with her clothing and hair is highly distracting.  I decided not to give this a lower rating because I have noticed ALL the women in the DVDs fidget with their cloths.  Why don't they just wear something comfortable that doesn't bind up?!  But I figured once I know the programs well enough, I won't have to look at her so much, so it won't be an issue.

The flow of the routines is okay.  Obviously edited and not too smoothly at that.  But again this seems to be a thing inherent to these types of DVDs (at least in my limited experience) so I'm not willing to rate lower because of it.  It's not nearly as distracting as the fidgeting anyway.

As a side note:
I would recommend any person starting out in yoga (or any sport) should view the DVD Anatomy for Yoga with Paul Grilley.  This excellent video gave me worlds of insight into how the bones work (or don't).

It has greatly improved my approach to some of the yoga poses.  And while I have far to go before I get past tension and face compression, I am now able to practice yoga mindful of not only what the muscles and tendons are doing, but what the bones are doing.  I can now really focus on what the pose is meant to achieve and....  Well, I don't know how to explain it, but there's just something about knowing what the bones are up to that helps.  Perhaps it's that it lays to rest a bit of the mystery of what's happening to the body and thus some of that restraining fear dissipates allowing a freer yoga practice.",1307232000,8,2534,4.237995824634655
3090945,5,B0012KK6R4,"I would have written a review much sooner but felt more justice to the DVD would be done if I spent some time practicing the different routines first. Now, having spent about a month regularly practicing all the routines offered on this disk I vouch with conviction the greatness of Deb Dobbin's practice. You'll notice from the get go Deb uses a lot of spiritual terminology but it's the the way in which she guides you through each routine which reveals a truly deep and spiritual yoga practice, and this sets her DVD far apart from other DVDs which although may also use lots of yoga terminology, aren't in practice very yoga.
Even if I come home from work tired which often is the case as my job is a very active one where I walk around for the whole day, and don't have any immediate energy left to do the more challenging yoga practices the second and last routine offer, Deb has a mysterious way of helping you to tap into an infinite spiritual energy within and this means I find myself completely energized at the end of each practice regardless of how I felt before - I can't say I have found this to be the case with a lot of my other DVDs which although I like for different reasons, can leave me feeling knackered and achy.
This practice also attempts to make you aware of some of the places tension is held but also created. Deb reminds us in some of the more taxing poses not to screw our faces and I (unlike one of the previous reviewers) actually really like this about her - her regular reminder really helps me to dissolve tension, not just move it from one place to another.
I could write on about the wonderful things this DVD has to offer but I can see from some of the other reviews many things have already been mentioned which I also agree with, so I won't repeat it.
Thank you Deb for this wonderful DVD",1303430400,,1829,4.335276967930029
3090946,5,B0012KK6R4,"I've had this video for almost exactly 2 yrs now. Last night when I was doing it I decided I should write a review, Deb deserves it! She is the yogi queen! I own so many yoga tapes and this one is the one I absolutely could not go without, this is my desert island exercise video. I do a little of everything every day, I've been at it since I was 15 and I will be 50 in September. As far as yoga goes, I hardly miss a day, I love Shiva Rea, Brian Kest, Seane Corn, Baron Baptiste, and all of the other top yogis and do all of their videos but I have to say, Deb tops them all, she kills you and soothes you all at the same time. And you feel completely worked out, even if you do the 39 minute routine (and add a back bend) . Others that are great besides the normals are Jennifer Lynn ( seriously good!) and Janet Stone ( love her! ) I owe reviews to these two also!  If you are serious about yoga you won't be disappointed. namaste",1301616000,3,934,3.8900523560209423
3090947,2,B0012KK6R4,I found this video hard to follow. You need to watch her as you're doing the flow because her verbal cues come after the poses -  which is pretty much impossible.  I tied to follow it a couple times and then gave up.,1298764800,6,216,4.0
3090948,5,B0012KK6R4,"Eveyone have so much great comments on this DVD, so I don't have much to say. I have this DVD for a while now and I have to say, this one is my favorite and is the one I always reached for very often. I always felt so relax and completely stretched after the practice from this.  Level A is not easy for complete beginner, I say it could be high beginner to low intermediate.  I can say I am about strong intermediate to high intermediate.  I did all 3 levels and I love all 3. Level C had more hand balancing poses and I definitely can't go all the way into some of the poses so I just try and go into them as far as I can go and hold there until she released. I feel that Level B always makes me feel completely satisfied after... I have to go to the wall to do my head stand or I could fall over and squish my kittie; he likes to do yoga with me and his favorite pose was Savasana on my mat during my practice though he does have his own mat LOL.  You just can't go wrong with this DVD...highly recommended.",1281398400,2,1010,3.9121951219512194
3090949,3,B0012KK6R4,"The short program and the first 70 minute program are decent intermediate (to advanced beginner) vinyasa series.  The supposedly advanced sequence is not especially advanced except for maybe two poses.  All three of the series don't seem particularly well balanced as far as difficulty of poses is concerned, and the instructor fails to maintain a good rhythm. The practice ends up being a little bit shallow.
  If you are looking for a challenging yoga sequence that will allow you to progress from modified poses to a really hard core practice, I would recommend The first series practice of Ashtanga yoga with David Swenson, instead.  His flow and rhythm are great, his form is breathtaking and his gentle and generous teaching approach comes through.  One never feels that he is full of it or that he is doing gymnastics, but rather that he is practicing yoga in the full sense of the term.",1274745600,5,894,4.848684210526316
3090970,5,B0012KK6R4,"I do this disc about once a week to once in 2 weeks. You have a choice of 3 workouts, two of which are 70-71 minutes long. This is a disc that I come back to year after year that I know I call fall back on when I am feeling like a good classic yoga workout, or I am tired of everything else. It's a bit challenging, but not too hard. Nice scenery a top of a large mountain on one of the workouts. Music is not so great--reminds me sometimes of Kate Bush. Commentary is pretty technical. She often says things like ""enjoy the stretch"" or ""enjoy how it feels."" I don't find that too mind expanding. I think Deb overusing the twisting high lunge a bit. There are 3 workouts - one beginners and two intermediate. I must admit that I find her instructional commentary section on specific poses to be the best I've seen.",1264464000,,814,4.158227848101266
3090971,5,B0012KK6R4,I love this yoga DVD.  I like how there are 3 different varieties.  The first one is 39 minutes and is excellent when I don't have much time and don't feel like working out too hard.  It still gives you great workout though.  The second one and the third one are more challenging and longer (70 and 71 minutes).  I find most of the poses in this DVD slightly slower than those in my normal power vinyasa classes I go to.  Her voice is very soothing and her speech is very well paced.  The DVD also provides step-by-step instructions for 20 poses which are great for beginners or for rechecking your postures.,1263600000,,608,4.375
3090972,5,B0012KK6R4,Great job by Deb Dobbins. I have been doing the 70 minute sessions for a while. Tried the 39 minute session the other day and was surprised and reminded just how good these sessions are. There is enough movement to break into a sweat and enough challenging poses to keep you coming back. The sessions are well rounded.,1262304000,,318,4.5
3090973,5,B0012KK6R4,"I have had a hard time finding vinyasa yoga DVDs that are not at a really basic, beginner's level that give me a good workout.  The only other two I have been completely satisfied with have been Bryan Krest and Shiva Rea.  So I was hesitant to buy this DVD but it turns out it was a good find.

As others have mentioned, there are three different complete practices, ranging from a slightly more basic 40 minute one to two 70-minute ones.  There is also a separate pose guide which gives tips and advice on how to be sure you're doing the pose correctly.  Some other reviewers have indicated the pose guide was for beginners, but I disagree.  Since I live overseas where there are no yoga classes I now have to do all my yoga by DVD with no instructor, and while I am at an intermediate or advanced level I don't always know if I have good form in the poses.  I liked the fact that the pose guide explains how to correctly move into the pose.  For example, she stresses that for pigeon pose it's important that the hips be square, and that yoga students have the tendency to roll the hips open on the pose.  That's exactly what I'd been doing all these years, so the pose guide is indeed useful for all levels.  (but it's true that the bit on scrunching up your face is a little odd!)

As for the practices, I found that like all yoga instructors Deb has incorporated her own style or variations into her teaching.  Her sun salutations do not seem classical to me at all, though it was refreshing to do them in a new way.  She incorporates some poses that I haven't done before or haven't seen done in the way that she does them.  I felt her pace was about right for my breathing, and the practices all gave a great cardio workout at the beginning as well as really great, deep hip stretches.  I felt the DVD was challenging but at the same time fairly doable--none of the extreme Shiva Rea arm balance poses that all of us average yoga practitioners will never be able to do no matter how many years we practice.  At least the things I couldn't do I could imagine doing in the future with enough practice.

I really found the DVD to be good, but there were a couple of things I wished were different.  Sometimes her cuing was not always clear and I found myself missing something.  While the scenery was nice enough, I did think it was odd that her yoga mat perched on that big rock seemed to be at a bit of a steep slope--not really the best positioning for yoga!  Also, the camera didn't always get a good angle of the pose and sometimes the DVD focused on her too long from a front angle instead a side angle to really show what she was doing.  In any case, once I have done the DVD more I'm sure I'll be more familiar with the sequences and the way she does the poses and it won't matter.  Finally, I was disappointed that there was not really any shavasana at the end...the moment you lay down the practice is done!",1259366400,5,2921,4.253623188405797
3090974,5,B0012KK6R4,"I only did set A and it is definitely for people who has practiced yoga before. She doesn't spend a lot of time to warm up and she moves between the moves much more quicker than I'm used to in a yoga class. The filming is the same place on the front cover. So, sometimes you can not tell what she is doing and since she changes her poses so quickly it can get confusing to figure out which side you are twisting to. So you might want to review the poses before starting the sets. It also ends abruptly. I just got comfortable in my lying position and the dvd jumps back to the menu. So I'm like lying there without music.
I guess it's because Set A is crammed into 37 minutes and she tries to deliver all the poses. However, I would prefer longer holds in some of the poses for a better stretch. It feels like I just got into a pose and she says, ok downward dog...
But overall, it's a pretty good dvd to practice at home.",1258588800,,922,4.043715846994536
3090975,5,B0012KK6R4,"I like Deb's style.  Starts out relaxing, then moves into more challenging poses, then relaxing again.  Great workout.  I'm a beginner/intermediate, so there were only a few moves I could not do.  Definitely recommended for strength training.",1252627200,,242,5.45945945945946
3090976,4,B0012KK6R4,"I have only used the 39 minute flow.  With that being said, I enjoyed it so much that I had to post.  This is great for everyone.  First timers will not be able to do the entire thing, so just watch the parts you can't do a few times and gradually you can work up to them. I highly recommend this one and I have tried many home practice dvds.  The 39 minute sequence was well-balanced and the instructor's voice and delivery is not agitating at all.",1248998400,,449,4.126436781609195
3090977,5,B0012KK6R4,"This is the best yoga vinyasa flow DVD I have seen. Her practice is fluid, her instructions clear, the product description is accurate (intermediate level) and the background breathtaking. I bought several DVD's looking for some change in my daily practice, and this is by far my favorite. There are also time options which allow for those mornings when practice needs to be shortened. I highly recommend this DVD!",1239148800,2,414,5.0144927536231885
3090978,5,B0012KK6R4,"There are 3 classes on this dvd.  Class a 39 minutes, class b 70 minutes, class c 71 minutes. I did classes a & b.  Both of these classes take place on a cliff, somewhere.  Why do yoga teachers insist on scaring us half to death by filming classes on rocks, cliffs, boulders or any place that looks dangerous or uncomfortable?? Would you do yoga on the edge of a cliff? I wouldn't.

Anyway, class A starts out as a nice simple easy class with a seated stretch, half salutes, half warrior one, triangle, standing split. Then it heats up to bound side angle and bird of paradise.  That pose took me by surprise as she had lulled me into thinking that this class was for beginners.  Alas it is not, it is for intermediates that don't feel like working very hard and are short on time. It also includes side stick with top leg in tree pose.  You get into this pose from one legged down dog. Interesting never tried it that way before and guess what, it works!  The class also includes camel, heros pose,and shoulder stretches.  For 39 minutes, it's a good, short,sweet class.  I sweated bullets and felt good afterwards.

Class b is a killer.  It concentrates on your hips and hamstrings.  Poses include salutes a & b with variations, half moon, warrior 1 & 2 with variations, full split, twisting lunge prayer and the most intense seated stretches I have ever seen on a yoga dvd thus far.  One pose was wide legged stretch with one leg bent behind you.  Ouch! felt that one. I have been doing this dvd for 3 weeks now and for the first time in my life I am able to do a complete full split. Suprised myself!

I sweated bullets, and felt great afterwards.  My only complaint was that on some of the poses, the camera angle wasn't good and I couldn't see what was going on.  Also, her cuing wasn't the greatest.  She lost me a couple of times and the right left thing is not part of her teaching style. She sometimes cues on one side, but not the other.  She also has the habit of adjusting her clothes and fidgeting alot. Better editing would have fixed this as it's distracting.

I just looked at class c and it includes a lot of arm balances.  I tried this class and it way above my pay grade. I'll leave this one alone, for now.

All in all a great vinyasa flow class.  Very little spirituality here, just a whole lot of stretching and sweating. Oh one more thing about the pose guide.  She goes over about 19 poses. Well not really as one section is about not scrunching up your face in class because it bothers her? Huh?  Anyway the poses are for absolute beginners.  She goes over common poses like triangle, lunge, warrior 1 & 2 half moon.  But wait this isn't a dvd for beginners.  It says that right on the cover of the dvd.  I was expecting her to explain how to get in and out of the intermediate/advanced poses, ie bird of paradise, side crow, head stand.  If you are an absolute beginner you shouldn't even buy this dvd.  To me, the pose guide was for another dvd, not this one.",1231286400,71,2987,4.307001795332137
3090979,5,B0012KK6R4,"There is a pose guide option in the main menu that allows one to see how the pose should look, common mistakes, variations of the pose if you're less flexible, and why the pose is beneficial.  So although the DVD difficulty rating is intermediate to advanced, a beginner can learn poses as he/she would in a yoga class.

One comment: this routine is definitely not for beginners...you must be familiar with vinyasa flow prior to attempting this workout. Which is actually one of the reasons I love it so much...no time wasted with explanations...you get to just get down to business!",1308700800,,558,4.524752475247524
3325441,5,B0012KK6R4,"I am a beginning yoga practitioner; I've been at this about four weeks.  When I started, I could barely bend over and touch the floor.  I purchased several yoga DVDs for variety.  This is by far one of my favorites.  I think it's because I have a real feeling of achievement and well-being when I do the programs.  The first time I could do the forward splits fully, without putting my hands on the floor, I was so proud I forgot to proceed to the next posture!  I just wanted to stay there and gloat.  Not very yogi-ish, eh?

But Ms Dobbin leads one through the poses in such a way that you really find your power and flexibility and are *able* to do the poses.  I have a few DVDs that do not properly flex and warm the body and by the time they hit the harder poses, you just aren't there.  (Power Yoga with Rodney Yee is another great DVD that seems to do things in a flow that appropriately prepares one for the succeeding poses.  By the time the bridge pose comes along, you can actually do the bridge pose.)

I will admit Ms Dobbin's fidgeting with her clothing and hair is highly distracting.  I decided not to give this a lower rating because I have noticed ALL the women in the DVDs fidget with their cloths.  Why don't they just wear something comfortable that doesn't bind up?!  But I figured once I know the programs well enough, I won't have to look at her so much, so it won't be an issue.

The flow of the routines is okay.  Obviously edited and not too smoothly at that.  But again this seems to be a thing inherent to these types of DVDs (at least in my limited experience) so I'm not willing to rate lower because of it.  It's not nearly as distracting as the fidgeting anyway.

As a side note:
I would recommend any person starting out in yoga (or any sport) should view the DVD Anatomy for Yoga with Paul Grilley.  This excellent video gave me worlds of insight into how the bones work (or don't).

It has greatly improved my approach to some of the yoga poses.  And while I have far to go before I get past tension and face compression, I am now able to practice yoga mindful of not only what the muscles and tendons are doing, but what the bones are doing.  I can now really focus on what the pose is meant to achieve and....  Well, I don't know how to explain it, but there's just something about knowing what the bones are up to that helps.  Perhaps it's that it lays to rest a bit of the mystery of what's happening to the body and thus some of that restraining fear dissipates allowing a freer yoga practice.",1307232000,8,2534,4.237995824634655
3325442,5,B0012KK6R4,"I would have written a review much sooner but felt more justice to the DVD would be done if I spent some time practicing the different routines first. Now, having spent about a month regularly practicing all the routines offered on this disk I vouch with conviction the greatness of Deb Dobbin's practice. You'll notice from the get go Deb uses a lot of spiritual terminology but it's the the way in which she guides you through each routine which reveals a truly deep and spiritual yoga practice, and this sets her DVD far apart from other DVDs which although may also use lots of yoga terminology, aren't in practice very yoga.
Even if I come home from work tired which often is the case as my job is a very active one where I walk around for the whole day, and don't have any immediate energy left to do the more challenging yoga practices the second and last routine offer, Deb has a mysterious way of helping you to tap into an infinite spiritual energy within and this means I find myself completely energized at the end of each practice regardless of how I felt before - I can't say I have found this to be the case with a lot of my other DVDs which although I like for different reasons, can leave me feeling knackered and achy.
This practice also attempts to make you aware of some of the places tension is held but also created. Deb reminds us in some of the more taxing poses not to screw our faces and I (unlike one of the previous reviewers) actually really like this about her - her regular reminder really helps me to dissolve tension, not just move it from one place to another.
I could write on about the wonderful things this DVD has to offer but I can see from some of the other reviews many things have already been mentioned which I also agree with, so I won't repeat it.
Thank you Deb for this wonderful DVD",1303430400,,1829,4.335276967930029
3325443,5,B0012KK6R4,"I've had this video for almost exactly 2 yrs now. Last night when I was doing it I decided I should write a review, Deb deserves it! She is the yogi queen! I own so many yoga tapes and this one is the one I absolutely could not go without, this is my desert island exercise video. I do a little of everything every day, I've been at it since I was 15 and I will be 50 in September. As far as yoga goes, I hardly miss a day, I love Shiva Rea, Brian Kest, Seane Corn, Baron Baptiste, and all of the other top yogis and do all of their videos but I have to say, Deb tops them all, she kills you and soothes you all at the same time. And you feel completely worked out, even if you do the 39 minute routine (and add a back bend) . Others that are great besides the normals are Jennifer Lynn ( seriously good!) and Janet Stone ( love her! ) I owe reviews to these two also!  If you are serious about yoga you won't be disappointed. namaste",1301616000,3,934,3.8900523560209423
3325444,2,B0012KK6R4,I found this video hard to follow. You need to watch her as you're doing the flow because her verbal cues come after the poses -  which is pretty much impossible.  I tied to follow it a couple times and then gave up.,1298764800,6,216,4.0
3325445,5,B0012KK6R4,"Eveyone have so much great comments on this DVD, so I don't have much to say. I have this DVD for a while now and I have to say, this one is my favorite and is the one I always reached for very often. I always felt so relax and completely stretched after the practice from this.  Level A is not easy for complete beginner, I say it could be high beginner to low intermediate.  I can say I am about strong intermediate to high intermediate.  I did all 3 levels and I love all 3. Level C had more hand balancing poses and I definitely can't go all the way into some of the poses so I just try and go into them as far as I can go and hold there until she released. I feel that Level B always makes me feel completely satisfied after... I have to go to the wall to do my head stand or I could fall over and squish my kittie; he likes to do yoga with me and his favorite pose was Savasana on my mat during my practice though he does have his own mat LOL.  You just can't go wrong with this DVD...highly recommended.",1281398400,2,1010,3.9121951219512194
3325446,3,B0012KK6R4,"The short program and the first 70 minute program are decent intermediate (to advanced beginner) vinyasa series.  The supposedly advanced sequence is not especially advanced except for maybe two poses.  All three of the series don't seem particularly well balanced as far as difficulty of poses is concerned, and the instructor fails to maintain a good rhythm. The practice ends up being a little bit shallow.
  If you are looking for a challenging yoga sequence that will allow you to progress from modified poses to a really hard core practice, I would recommend The first series practice of Ashtanga yoga with David Swenson, instead.  His flow and rhythm are great, his form is breathtaking and his gentle and generous teaching approach comes through.  One never feels that he is full of it or that he is doing gymnastics, but rather that he is practicing yoga in the full sense of the term.",1274745600,5,894,4.848684210526316
3325467,5,B0012KK6R4,"I do this disc about once a week to once in 2 weeks. You have a choice of 3 workouts, two of which are 70-71 minutes long. This is a disc that I come back to year after year that I know I call fall back on when I am feeling like a good classic yoga workout, or I am tired of everything else. It's a bit challenging, but not too hard. Nice scenery a top of a large mountain on one of the workouts. Music is not so great--reminds me sometimes of Kate Bush. Commentary is pretty technical. She often says things like ""enjoy the stretch"" or ""enjoy how it feels."" I don't find that too mind expanding. I think Deb overusing the twisting high lunge a bit. There are 3 workouts - one beginners and two intermediate. I must admit that I find her instructional commentary section on specific poses to be the best I've seen.",1264464000,,814,4.158227848101266
3325468,5,B0012KK6R4,I love this yoga DVD.  I like how there are 3 different varieties.  The first one is 39 minutes and is excellent when I don't have much time and don't feel like working out too hard.  It still gives you great workout though.  The second one and the third one are more challenging and longer (70 and 71 minutes).  I find most of the poses in this DVD slightly slower than those in my normal power vinyasa classes I go to.  Her voice is very soothing and her speech is very well paced.  The DVD also provides step-by-step instructions for 20 poses which are great for beginners or for rechecking your postures.,1263600000,,608,4.375
3325469,5,B0012KK6R4,Great job by Deb Dobbins. I have been doing the 70 minute sessions for a while. Tried the 39 minute session the other day and was surprised and reminded just how good these sessions are. There is enough movement to break into a sweat and enough challenging poses to keep you coming back. The sessions are well rounded.,1262304000,,318,4.5
3325470,5,B0012KK6R4,"I have had a hard time finding vinyasa yoga DVDs that are not at a really basic, beginner's level that give me a good workout.  The only other two I have been completely satisfied with have been Bryan Krest and Shiva Rea.  So I was hesitant to buy this DVD but it turns out it was a good find.

As others have mentioned, there are three different complete practices, ranging from a slightly more basic 40 minute one to two 70-minute ones.  There is also a separate pose guide which gives tips and advice on how to be sure you're doing the pose correctly.  Some other reviewers have indicated the pose guide was for beginners, but I disagree.  Since I live overseas where there are no yoga classes I now have to do all my yoga by DVD with no instructor, and while I am at an intermediate or advanced level I don't always know if I have good form in the poses.  I liked the fact that the pose guide explains how to correctly move into the pose.  For example, she stresses that for pigeon pose it's important that the hips be square, and that yoga students have the tendency to roll the hips open on the pose.  That's exactly what I'd been doing all these years, so the pose guide is indeed useful for all levels.  (but it's true that the bit on scrunching up your face is a little odd!)

As for the practices, I found that like all yoga instructors Deb has incorporated her own style or variations into her teaching.  Her sun salutations do not seem classical to me at all, though it was refreshing to do them in a new way.  She incorporates some poses that I haven't done before or haven't seen done in the way that she does them.  I felt her pace was about right for my breathing, and the practices all gave a great cardio workout at the beginning as well as really great, deep hip stretches.  I felt the DVD was challenging but at the same time fairly doable--none of the extreme Shiva Rea arm balance poses that all of us average yoga practitioners will never be able to do no matter how many years we practice.  At least the things I couldn't do I could imagine doing in the future with enough practice.

I really found the DVD to be good, but there were a couple of things I wished were different.  Sometimes her cuing was not always clear and I found myself missing something.  While the scenery was nice enough, I did think it was odd that her yoga mat perched on that big rock seemed to be at a bit of a steep slope--not really the best positioning for yoga!  Also, the camera didn't always get a good angle of the pose and sometimes the DVD focused on her too long from a front angle instead a side angle to really show what she was doing.  In any case, once I have done the DVD more I'm sure I'll be more familiar with the sequences and the way she does the poses and it won't matter.  Finally, I was disappointed that there was not really any shavasana at the end...the moment you lay down the practice is done!",1259366400,5,2921,4.253623188405797
3325471,5,B0012KK6R4,"I only did set A and it is definitely for people who has practiced yoga before. She doesn't spend a lot of time to warm up and she moves between the moves much more quicker than I'm used to in a yoga class. The filming is the same place on the front cover. So, sometimes you can not tell what she is doing and since she changes her poses so quickly it can get confusing to figure out which side you are twisting to. So you might want to review the poses before starting the sets. It also ends abruptly. I just got comfortable in my lying position and the dvd jumps back to the menu. So I'm like lying there without music.
I guess it's because Set A is crammed into 37 minutes and she tries to deliver all the poses. However, I would prefer longer holds in some of the poses for a better stretch. It feels like I just got into a pose and she says, ok downward dog...
But overall, it's a pretty good dvd to practice at home.",1258588800,,922,4.043715846994536
3325472,5,B0012KK6R4,"I like Deb's style.  Starts out relaxing, then moves into more challenging poses, then relaxing again.  Great workout.  I'm a beginner/intermediate, so there were only a few moves I could not do.  Definitely recommended for strength training.",1252627200,,242,5.45945945945946
3325473,4,B0012KK6R4,"I have only used the 39 minute flow.  With that being said, I enjoyed it so much that I had to post.  This is great for everyone.  First timers will not be able to do the entire thing, so just watch the parts you can't do a few times and gradually you can work up to them. I highly recommend this one and I have tried many home practice dvds.  The 39 minute sequence was well-balanced and the instructor's voice and delivery is not agitating at all.",1248998400,,449,4.126436781609195

I bought several DVD's looking for some change in my daily practice, and this is by far my favorite. There are also time options which allow for those mornings when practice needs to be shortened. I highly recommend this DVD!",1239148800,2,414,5.0144927536231885
3325475,5,B0012KK6R4,"There are 3 classes on this dvd.  Class a 39 minutes, class b 70 minutes, class c 71 minutes. I did classes a & b.  Both of these classes take place on a cliff, somewhere.  Why do yoga teachers insist on scaring us half to death by filming classes on rocks, cliffs, boulders or any place that looks dangerous or uncomfortable?? Would you do yoga on the edge of a cliff? I wouldn't.

Anyway, class A starts out as a nice simple easy class with a seated stretch, half salutes, half warrior one, triangle, standing split. Then it heats up to bound side angle and bird of paradise.  That pose took me by surprise as she had lulled me into thinking that this class was for beginners.  Alas it is not, it is for intermediates that don't feel like working very hard and are short on time. It also includes side stick with top leg in tree pose.  You get into this pose from one legged down dog. Interesting never tried it that way before and guess what, it works!  The class also includes camel, heros pose,and shoulder stretches.  For 39 minutes, it's a good, short,sweet class.  I sweated bullets and felt good afterwards.

Class b is a killer.  It concentrates on your hips and hamstrings.  Poses include salutes a & b with variations, half moon, warrior 1 & 2 with variations, full split, twisting lunge prayer and the most intense seated stretches I have ever seen on a yoga dvd thus far.  One pose was wide legged stretch with one leg bent behind you.  Ouch! felt that one. I have been doing this dvd for 3 weeks now and for the first time in my life I am able to do a complete full split. Suprised myself!

I sweated bullets, and felt great afterwards.  My only complaint was that on some of the poses, the camera angle wasn't good and I couldn't see what was going on.  Also, her cuing wasn't the greatest.  She lost me a couple of times and the right left thing is not part of her teaching style. She sometimes cues on one side, but not the other.  She also has the habit of adjusting her clothes and fidgeting alot. Better editing would have fixed this as it's distracting.

I just looked at class c and it includes a lot of arm balances.  I tried this class and it way above my pay grade. I'll leave this one alone, for now.

All in all a great vinyasa flow class.  Very little spirituality here, just a whole lot of stretching and sweating. Oh one more thing about the pose guide.  She goes over about 19 poses. Well not really as one section is about not scrunching up your face in class because it bothers her? Huh?  Anyway the poses are for absolute beginners.  She goes over common poses like triangle, lunge, warrior 1 & 2 half moon.  But wait this isn't a dvd for beginners.  It says that right on the cover of the dvd.  I was expecting her to explain how to get in and out of the intermediate/advanced poses, ie bird of paradise, side crow, head stand.  If you are an absolute beginner you shouldn't even buy this dvd.  To me, the pose guide was for another dvd, not this one.",1231286400,71,2987,4.307001795332137
3325476,5,B0012KK6R4,"There is a pose guide option in the main menu that allows one to see how the pose should look, common mistakes, variations of the pose if you're less flexible, and why the pose is beneficial.  So although the DVD difficulty rating is intermediate to advanced, a beginner can learn poses as he/she would in a yoga class.  The music is calming, at times seemingly non-existent so you can easily hear what she's telling you.",1227484800,2,421,4.6

As a home yogi of 7 years, I've been enjoying these 3 flows of Deb's for several months.  What I love about Deb's style is that she combines clear, specific cuing and instruction with a peaceful, joyous, relaxing tone.  She also incorporates some very creative and inventive poses and sequences which I have not seen before--and I have over 50 yoga dvds.  For example, I was taken by surprise by her creative entrance into full bow-pose--coming in from single-leg lift then twisting around--how fun is that!  Her flows go by fast, as they are learnable yet interesting.  This dvd is absolutely in my top 5.  My favorite flow is B, but I also like A and C (though C does not have a warm-up).  I like how she educates as she leads, talking about breath, sensation, physiology, anatomy, subtle energy movement, alignment, while keeping the jaw and mind at ease--I just really love her style.

I liked that she didn't try to intersperse her cues with philosophical comments about yoga, Buddhism or anything besides the actual poses. There are a few drawbacks to this DVD. The main ones is that in the first two practices, which are filmed in a beautiful natural setting, she is filmed from too far away for the viewer to clearly see what she is doing, so the viewer not familiar with the poses may struggle a little, while in the third one she is filmed from up close but against an all-white background, which I found distracting. Surely she could have been filmed in her studio in Santa Barbara. But I love the poses and the sequencing.",1474761600,,821,4.372549019607843

At times the flows were really slow and then sped up to way too fast.  The cueing didn't keep up, so had to keep looking up at television which I don't like to do.
I have a large collection of yoga DVDs and I just can't see me keeping this one in my collection.  If you could do it many times in a row, I feel like you would have her flow memorized but I rotate through a large number of yoga DVDs, and it was just too annoying to try to figure out what was coming next.

I'm an advanced beginner/intermediate and while I could keep up with her practice if I paused the DVD, I had absolutely no idea at certain times what on earth she was doing.  Verbal cues are sometimes completely omitted or they come after she's already moved into the next pose.  There's also very very little direction of how to get into a pose or how to hold a pose property, one needs to simply know that - so this isn't really for beginners if you want to advance your practice.  I also found her a bit preoccupied with highlighting her sculpted arms which, to me, became a tad bit annoying.
