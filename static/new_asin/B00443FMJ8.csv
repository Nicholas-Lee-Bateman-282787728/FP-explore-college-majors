because of the situation in that country, also , we are busy with our children and grandchildren, life is good!
Amazon does a great job!  Keep up the good work!

4259910,4,B00443FMJ8,"I knew of Europe's ""Dark Age,"" but I didn't know other regions had similar periods (if this can be differentiated from ""declines"").  This doc analyzes a sarcophagus that was made of silver, rather than gold.  The work says it was an unraided tomb (which they fudge a bit), so obviously comparisons between this pharaoh and King Tut come up.

Like more and more documentaries, this one emphasizes the difficulty, and danger, in discovering this knowledge.  This work mentions Ancient Egypt and mid-20th-century Germany in the same breath, so eventually someone does bring up ""Indiana Jones.""

I'm a Chicagoan and the info here actually reminded me of our city's T-Rex named Sue.  Reports in Chicago newspapers state that although Sue probably lived a long 70 years, her bones also show that she must have faced much physical wear and tear.  Here, the narrator says the pharaoh lived 80 or so years when most Ancient Egyptians were lucky to reach 35 years.  They mention his height too, but never say if he was much taller than his peers, which is my guess.  They also say he was fairly muscular or built.  Still, he had uneven eyes.  He had illnesses or deformities in his mouth and on his back.  This may make you think of the Romantic poem ""Ozymandias.""

This work makes use of computer graphics, timelines, and other modern visual techniques to keep the viewer's interest.  They use forensics to solve things.  For example, radar helps them to find towns or royal homes that have been hidden for centuries.  These techniques may be a reason to see the work even if Ancient Egypt doesn't interest you generally.

I love Dr. Zahi Hawass, with his dramatic style and deep chin dimple.  Still, he doesn't have to be in all Egyptian documentaries and he is absent here.  This film had diverse interviewees.  They record two female Egyptian scholars.  Also, one main interviewee is clearly a rainbow flag gentleman, if you know what I mean.

Gold lovers, gold is not left out of the picture!  The work says gold was called ""the flesh of the gods"" and silver ""the bones of the gods.""  It said silver was scarcer in Egypt than gold, but the former is harder to work than the latter.",1296950400,8,2176,4.710875331564987
8415738,5,B00443FMJ8,"By 1940, French Professor Pierre Montet had lead Egyptian archeological expeditions for 10 years. Finally, the find of a lifetime, the unrobbed tomb of a pharaoh. Not only that, but of Psusennes I, a pharaoh from Egypt's dark ages, so called because we don't know much about it. It was a period of civil war and foreign invasion, for one thing. Ancient Egypt had at least 170 pharaohs, and we've found the graves of only 70 of them (as of 2010).

Unfortunately, WWII was closing in on Egypt in 1940. Montet had to pack everything up and wasn't able to study the tomb contents in situ. Not only that, the contents were stuffed into the innards of a museum, and Psusennes' bones weren't studied for another 70 years.

This pharaoh had reined for at least 46 years. His tomb had gold and treasures even more spectacular than Tutankhamen. Psusennes was a very big deal, yet, hardly anyone has heard about him. Watch this show for the fascinating story of how his tomb was found, what we know of the world he lived in, and even a forensic artist's portrait extrapolated from his skeleton. And, why having a silver casket was actually more expensive than a gold one.

Commentators include Dr. Peter Lacovara (Egytologist), Selima Ikram (Egyptologist), Fawzi Gabbalah (professor of anatomy), Melissa Dring (forensic artist) and Jon Privitt (archeologist and silversmith).

This ""Secrets of the Dead"" episode originally aired in November 2010. It is a bit under 60 minutes long and has English SDH subtitles available on the DVD.

I always enjoy ""Secrets of the Dead"", but I'm partial to their episodes on ancient Egypt.

8415741,5,B00443FMJ8,"The PBS series ""Secrets of the Dead"" is one of my all-time favorite public television offerings.  There's so much to learn from watching and this particular episode was about a subject I had never heard of before.  The ancient Egyptian pharaoh Psusennes I was nearly lost to history and I certainly am glad that he was found.  His story is fascinating and the forensic artist's recreation of him is all the more reason to buy this DVD.  I highly recommend it!",1440460800,,459,4.62962962962963

8415746,5,B00443FMJ8,"This video deals with a little known Pharaoh of the late period of Egyptian Pharaonic History.  His tomb was discovered intact during the early years of World War II.  As result, the treasures of this tomb are little known.  I am wary of most videos/ TV documentaries.  However, this proved to be an exception.  This history of the exploration of the tomb was not hyped.  The historical outline was not sensationalized and the historical context was well done.  I even found the exposition of the pharaoh's life and physical condition well done.  I really enjoyed this video and it was well worth the money.",1357516800,9,607,4.769230769230769
