8513380,5,B007AGOT4A,"My husband and I have been reading about, working with a in person trainer, and practicing BAT (Behavior Adjustment Training) for some time now.  This video fits right along with the premise of BAT and what we hope to accomplish with our family dog.  It will continue to work as a guide in setting up exercises and training scenarios now and in the future for us.

The menu on the DVD is super easy to navigate and allows you to pick and choose which sections (there are tons!)  you want to work on.  We have watched it straight through once to just familiarize ourselves with what each topic covers and plan to go back and complete each training exercise (many times!)

It definitely teaches the specifics of training exercises and all the little difficult things that may come up while putting it into practice.  This is helpful as it prepares you for situations and allows you to pre plan and prevent bad experiences (which is what BAT encourages you to avoid).  I like Ali's teaching style and wish I could make it to her in person training, but for now this will do!

Will definitely keep checking back to snatch up any new training materials she puts out!  Positive Reinforcement training has really done great things for our family and pup.",1401580800,,1247,4.601809954751131
