6444426,5,B00KRAXFWI,"Aaahhh, VeggieTales. Who knew that animated vegetables could be so entertaining? Bob, Larry, and the gang have been teaching kids Biblical lessons with fun stories and some of the catchiest and craziest songs out there.

Each movie just seems to get better and Celery Night Fever is no exception. I mean, how do you top disco-singing veggies? They probably will, but it will take some work. As an adult I was very impressed with the movie overall, and kids will love it.

VeggieTales is a perfect alternative to cartoons. Not only do you not have to worry what your kids are being taught but you just might find yourself watching too, and humming...

Celery Night Fever is a colorful, musical, adventure in forgiveness that kids are sure to enjoy. Don't miss VeggieTales' latest movie!

6444427,4,B00KRAXFWI,"RATING 4.5 STARS

My kids have never known a world that didn't include the comic stylings of a certain tomato and cucumber duo. And Ive seen these two characters endure many ups and downs and hardships and struggles that made it seem like they were headed to the juicer (so to speak). Fortunately, theyve survived and continue to star in highly enjoyable films that find the funny bone of both young and old.

And though this particular episode deals with disco and an era that pre-dates my boys, the jokes and the quality of entertainment aren't tied to the time period. So, the references that go over their heads are funny to me and the simultaneous antics are funny to them (and me). In short, Celery Night Fever is a story about relationships and exclusion, revenge and forgiveness. Its poignant and offers a great illustration. Plus, it features the voice of Terry Crews, the Old Spice guy. Well, one of the Old Spice guys.

I keep hearing rumors of good things coming down the pike for the VeggieTales brand and this release is a prime example of why these veggies have stood the test of time. I cant wait to see what else is in store going forward.",1407456000,,1156,4.548076923076923
6444428,4,B00KRAXFWI,"Celery Night Fever. Being a late 90s child, I didn't get the whole play on Saturday Night Fever that Big Ideas did, my parents did though and explained it to me. ;) So some things will, like normal in a Veggie Tales movie, go over the childs head.

I thought the music was funky (which apparently means cool? Hahaha! ) and really enjoyed singing along after hearing it a few times. :) I cant wait to watch this with the girls I babysit because we all can use a lesson in forgiveness!

On the Perfect Puppy silly song, I don't think it was as great as the classics His Cheeseburger or Hairbrush or the newer Monkey or Bubble Wrap, but it was cute.

4.5 of 5 stars. :)

6444429,5,B00KRAXFWI,"It was a privilege to have the opportunity to review the newest addition to the VeggieTales DVD collection, Celery Night Fever, as part of FLYBY Promotions Blogger Network review program. Celery Night Fever is exclusively available in DVD format and was released on August 5th. VeggieTales is a beloved company that creates faith-based products and a line of family DVD's that teach children about God's love and how He made them special. Years ago my daughter received a collection of VeggieTales DVD's as a gift. My daughter became a huge fan of the DVD's when she was much younger and since then we've added several more movies to our personal collection over the years. I was thrilled when I found out we had the opportunity to review Celery Night Fever!

How We Used the DVD
We watched Celery Night Fever during family movie night as we snuggled on the couch eating popcorn. My 6 1/2 year-old daughter also watched the DVD several other times during the review period. This would be a great movie for children to watch with their friends during a sleepover or movie playdate.

Overall Thoughts
Celery Night Fever is a wonderful family movie and addition to our VeggieTales collection! This DVD didn't disappoint us. The story's plot was entertaining and engaging. The VeggieTale stories always teach valuable lessons with appropriate scenes and adorable characters. There was only one awkwardly funny part where Junior came out wearing his underwear over his pants after realizing he was late meeting his friend, Laura. My daughter couldn't stop laughing. She sat through the entire show without EVER getting bored! It doesn't surprise me that VeggieTales has once again captured her undivided attention.

The movie consists of catchy disco-style musical tunes. As always, the music motivated my daughter. Her favorite song from the movie was ""Perfect Puppy."" I caught her groovin' to all the fun tunes on many occasions. She LOVED dancing to the six original songs included in the show.

Celery Night Fever lasts approximately 45 minutes and provides both English and Spanish subtitles. I appreciate that the VeggieTale products always emphasize great moral values. I was throughly impressed with the fact that my daughter automatically caught on to the story's theme. She learned to value the importance of friendship and forgiveness in a fun, interactive way without further explanation from me. The message contains meaningful lessons which can be applied to my daughter's life and her relationships with both friends and family members. I'm glad that she is still young enough to appreciate and watch the high quality shows created by the VeggieTales team. I can trust that VeggieTales DVD's will always contain appropriate content that my daughter can safely view without constant supervision.

The movie arrived at the perfect time for our family. We are currently dealing with unfortunate circumstances where forgiveness has been extremely difficult. This movie served as a great reminder during these challenging times. The message is that we should forgive others just as God has forgiven us. I truly want my daughter to know that she can forgive others when they have wronged or hurt us. Everyone should also understand that holding grudges hurts and brings trouble to all involved. Other underlying themes in this show are hope, trust, and selfishness.

Visit the VeggieTales website to view the Celery Night Fever FREE Downloads including coloring pages, recipes, crafts, and activities which reinforce the lesson and message of the show. We enjoyed the psychedelic celery experiment and had a blast making tie dyed rice cereal treats. We have plans later this week to watch the show again. We will attempt the homemade sidewalk chalk paint and rock coloring activities following the show.

Recommendations
I HIGHLY recommend Celery Night Fever and ALL VeggieTales movies to children ages 2-7 yeas old. VeggieTales fans will definitely appreciate this show! The important message is one that we can ALL learn and benefit from. I recommend this DVD for at home use and to use during Sunday School class at church. I look forward to seeing future shows. I can't wait to watch Beauty and the Beet featuring Kellie Pickler in the fall!

6444430,4,B00KRAXFWI,"Our family loved this latest VeggieTales movies! They still continue to have a Biblical message weaved throughout there movies as well as have some fun songs to go along with it and this one is definitely no different!

My son's favorite thing about Celery Night Fever were the songs! Almost every time a new song came on he would get up and dance! I really enjoyed the songs just as much and danced along with him! I think my favorite song was ""Together"" and the beautiful message it portrayed of forgiving one another!

Concerning the way they talked about forgiveness and showing what it is I think was easy for kids to relate too! It was simple and fun all at the same time! I really liked the verse they used for the movie as well!

I give Celery Night Fever a 4.5 out of 5 stars!

6444459,1,B00KRAXFWI,"As old as I currently am (17 years), I do not enjoy VeggieTales all that much, though I do agree it is normally a good Christian kid show and I enjoy watching some of the older VeggieTales shows I watched when I was younger. That brings back memories. Some I like include Rack Shack and Benny, Are You My Neighbor, Josh and the Big Wall, Larry Boy and the Rumor Weed, and Madame Blueberry.

I think this VeggieTales episode is too silly. I do not like the way veggies dress. I think Larry looks ridiculous in his purple wig, costume, and glasses. I do not like the Celery Park music. I also dislike the part when Junior comes out in his underwear. I agree with I believe a couple of other reviews on this item I saw which said veggies on there had bad attitudes. Laura was not being forgiving to Junior at first, though she thankfully was in the end. I still do not think Laura on this episode is quite as friendly as she is on the older episodes. I also do not like the fact that the Groovy brothers refused to play together for THIRTY-EIGHT years just because of an old grudge! I am glad Bob forgave Larry in the end, though, as well.

Overall, I do think this is a good show that teaches a lesson about forgiving, I just think it is too silly and not very good. I do not plan on watching this again.

My favorite show is Little House on the Prairie, another show a lot of Christians enjoy watching. I can watch it all day long. My favorite Little House on the Prairie episodes are some episodes from Season 6 (Back to School, Sweet Sixteen, He Loves Me He Loves Me Not) and The Reincarnation of Nellie (from Season 8).",1479945600,2,1621,4.239482200647249

I'm not going to spoil the plot by telling the whole story, but the core lesson is forgiveness, which is illustrated by the younger characters, older characters, and even the villain.  The story is interesting, easy to follow, and has plenty of humor.  Seeing the Vegetables with '70s hairdos is particularly funny.  The guest cast member is the talented and funny Terry Crews, who does a great job playing the villain.  He even sings some and does a respectable job.

It's also worth noting that the musical crew did an especially good job coming up with '70s funk-style songs.  The music is very catchy, and at times, it just flat out rocks.  For a vegetable cartoon show in which the goal is mostly to come up with silly tunes, they really went all out.",1441411200,,895,4.509316770186335

6444507,5,B00KRAXFWI,"This is my kids favorite Vegietales movie since ""Incredible Vegitables.""  Good music and a good story.",1436054400,,102,5.375
6444508,5,B00KRAXFWI,"Maybe it has happened before, but right now I cant think of a time that VeggieTales covered a lesson a second time.  But thats the case with Celery Night Fever, the latest offering from this long running series.  And with how long it has been running, Im only surprised they haven't circled back around to forgiveness before now since they last tackled this topic in their second video.  Anyway, this is a great new story.

We open on the countertop as Bob the Tomato and Larry the Cucumber are about to introduce the new story.  Only they are interrupted by Jerry and Jimmy Gourd who are upset because Larry ate the entire pie that the trio had made together and were supposed to share.  (And since Jerry and Jimmy and their appetite were introduced in that long ago third episode, I find it appropriate.)  Jerry and Jimmy are furious and say they will never forgive Larry, but Bob thinks he has just the story for them.

And so we roll film to hear the story of Laura Carrot who is fighting to save Celery Park from a developer.  After Junior Asparagus doesnt follow through (again) with his part of the plan to save the park, she breaks off her friendship with him and tries to come up with a new plan on her own.

That plan involves her grandfather (Larry the Cucumber, and I don't think I want to know how that is possible).  See, back in the day he was one of the leads in The Groovy Brothers, a disco band who got their start in Celery Park.  If Laura can reunite the band, maybe they can raise the funds to buy the note from the developer.  But why did the group break up?  Will it keep them from coming back together?  Can Laura save the park?  And what about her friendship with Junior?

The story really shows how unforgiveness can keep you apart from people you love, and I like that.  The actual forgiveness part seems to happen pretty quickly and for no real reason, but thats a minor complaint.  Overall, the message is clear and strong without being too preachy.

Along the way, we get plenty of fun moments, most of which the adults will probably enjoy more than the kids.  There are lots of references and throwbacks to the 70s since this is a disco themed episode.  While still not the peak of the series, I grinned several times throughout the story.  Heck, I got a huge kick out of Archibald being one of the other members of the Groovy Brothers.  Plus they brought Kalil back as well.

The music certainly adds to the fun.  There are quite a few new songs, and they are all good.  Several of them have a disco flavor, and they will get stuck in your head, so be forewarned.

Unfortunately, the new Silly Song is the weak point of the disc.  Perfect Puppy actually does star Larry and Bob as Larry is anxious to get a new puppy.  (I really thought it might star Achmetha who has been obsessed with puppies since Esther.)  Its amusing, especially at the end, but its not one of the better ones.

One word of warning.  There is a brief interview with Terry Crew, who plays the onion developer who is trying to buy and close the park.  As he is talking about how excited he was to get the call to play the part, he takes the Lords name in vain.  Now if you read my blog regularly, you will see positive reviews of plenty of things with swearing in them.  However, in something aimed at Christian kids, this was a surprise and totally out of place.  But if you just avoid that special feature (and its easy to do), youll be fine.

On the whole, Celery Night Fever proves to be entertaining and it shows why we need to forgive others.  Kids will definitely enjoy it and be singing the songs before you know it.",1434585600,,3626,4.339285714285714

6444519,5,B00KRAXFWI,"I confess:
1) I am a grown-up.
2) I am a huge VeggieTales fan. Whenever my kids are watching one of the DVDs, I have a hard time not watching it with them. (Even though the whole point is so I can do something else for a bit!)

This has got to be one of the very best, in my opinion. It's a lesson on forgiveness, not based on a Bible story. Many of the newer ones are not. This is sad, to me, as I feel VeggieTales has lost its roots, but that's another story. I still think VeggieTales is quality entertainment for children and adults, with good morals and humor.

My favorite thing about Celery Night Fever though, is the music! It is so stinking catchy! It is in my head all the time (possibly cause my kids are always singing the songs!)

6444537,2,B00KRAXFWI,"This was definitely not what I expect from veggie tales.  I thought they weren't going to mention God at all, but they finally did towards the very end.  The villain is a real estate  tycoon who wants to buy an old park and remodel it into something industrial.  Laura carrot does not want him to do this and tries to raise money to buy and fix the park up.  She bosses her grandfather into getting his band, the groovy brothers, back together for a reunion concert.
  The message is obviously anti-capitalist.  All the villain wants to do is buy a property and develop it as he sees fit... what's wrong with that?  (Yes his attitude is terrible and he is not a nice man)  The characters are whiny, the jokes aren't funny, the music is average to poor, the message is blurred by all the anti-capitalism sentiments and the weak characters, and God is an afterthought.  Basically, this is the worst veggie tales I've seen (I think I've seen them all too).  Don't buy it, don't watch it, don't waste your time.
  Since I'm already ranting...  What ever happened to the ""easter-eggs"" on the dvds and what happened to the commentary?  Bonus features are pretty lame lately.  Come on Big Idea, what's the big idea?",1415318400,4,1208,4.544186046511628

We would say there hasn't been a Veggie Tales video this good since The Incredible Vegetables and Penniless Princess era (2012).  It is full of music (extra in this one, since they are a band!) and the music is top-notch.
