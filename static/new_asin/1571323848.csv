188159,4,1571323848,"I thought this was a good tape. However, My son likes the older Barney tape called ""Waiting for Santa"" much better--It captures is attention and interest. I think the new Barney ""Night Before Christmas  tape"" is for children who already understand the concept of X-mas and  Santa.  My son is 19 months and ""Waiting for Santa"" seems to be  more entertaining for him. It seems to cater more to entertaining than to  the X-mas concept.",944092800,5,432,4.706666666666667
188160,5,1571323848,"I bought this dvd for my daughter because she loves Barney and sat and watched it the first time she watched it. I was pleasantly surprised to find it was actually an enjoyable show, even for adults (that is if you can stomach the purple thing!) The songs they sing are really nice and  enjoyable to listen to....not typical of Barney in my opinion but then my  daughter loves him. I have a feeling this will be a dvd we will continue to  watch through the year.",943747200,6,462,4.287356321839081
188161,5,1571323848,Our special needs son LOVES all the Barney videos and we have to replace his favorite ones often.  He plays them everyday.,1360368000,,122,4.545454545454546
188162,5,1571323848,Very good movie for the young. My grandson just loved it. Was very educated for the two to eight age group.,1359590400,,107,4.142857142857143
188163,5,1571323848,"The scene starts of near at a sunny beach house; Brock exclaims how nice it was of Professor Oak to let them stay there for the holidays, And Misty says how it will be the best Christmas ever. Ash then says that they have to and pick up the Christmas cake and says to Pikachu that he's in charge while their gone and Misty tells Togepi to behave.

The Pokmon all stare with blank faces at the front door and Togepi walks off to explore and stares up at a door and Pikachu pushes it open the Pokmon walk over to a big Christmas Tree and gaze at how pretty it is. Squirtle then notices the Kitchen and tells Bulbasaur and Pikachu, everyone then walks into the kitchen and notices party hats and food on the table. They all clamber up onto the table and Vulpix sniffs a party hat unsure of what it is, Squirtle peers into his, Bulbasaur balances his on his nose and Psyduck tries to eat his. Vulpix then realises they go on the head and flips it up on its head, Pikachu and Togepi then put theirs on their heads as does everyone else except Pysduck's lands on his tail.

Togepi and Pikachu march out of kitchen back into the main room and they look at their reflections in some baubles and make funny faces. Meanwhile in the kitchen Bulbasaur picks up a Bulbasaur shaped cookie whilst Squirtle tries to pull a party popper and succeeds in doing so when he accidentally makes Bulbasaur jump with the cookie he was holding which flies into the air and lands into Squirtle's mouth of which he consequently eats. Bulbasaur is mad at Squirtle for eating the cookie and Squirtle jumps off the table and runs off with Bulbasaur chasing him. Whilst this is happening Vulpix is trying to pick some things out of a Stocking and gets its head stuck in the process and try's to get free. Vulpix then March's off forward with the stocking still stuck on its head and walks straight into a wall.

Meanwhile back on the table Psyduck sees a bottle of ""Pokmon Cider"" picks it up and tries to pull the cork out with his mouth and fails, he then starts shaking it. Anyways back on the floor Bulbasaur is still chasing Squirtle, Pikachu and Togepi look onward at them and Bulbasaur uses his Vinewhip to grab hold of Squirtle and in the process pulls the tree over to 1 side. Pikachu manages to put it back normal again until Vulpix fly's out of no where with the stocking still on its head and lands on top of the Christmas tree. The tree now topples the other way and Pikachu pushes it back to normal again as the stocking falls off Vulpix's head it jumps down onto the floor while Pikachu stands there exhausted Bulbasaur continues to chase Squirtle who this time trips over the tree lights pulling the tree over once more as Pikachu struggles to keep it up right.

Back in the kitchen the cork at long last fires out of the bottle bouncing off some the walls and hitting Pikachu flying which then causes the Tree to fall on him. Bulbasaur and Squirtle then stop what they are doing and look at the now toppled Christmas tree, Pikachu crawls out and Bulbasaur and Squirtle start laughing but soon stop when they see Pikachu is mad and Pikachu releases a thundershock in the room knocking the lights out.

Everyone now looks around at each other and Pikachu walks over to a Chest like box and opens it up to see a small flashing Christmas tree playing some cute music, everyone stares happily at it until it suddenly stops making everyone unhappy. Pikachu then looks at the Christmas tree and everyone helps push it back up whilst Psyduck and Togepi hang the baubles back on.

Ash Misty and Brock return and Ash says ""Its pitch black in here!"" and Brock explains it gets dark very early now. Ash opens the door to see the Christmas tree being powered by Pikachu.

Misty says ""its beautiful!"" and they all party as the screen pans out of the house to the sky where we see a Flying Rapidash and a sleigh.",1349913600,,3881,4.396935933147632
188164,2,1571323848,"My husband accidentally bought this VHS tape, thinking it was a DVD and it is THE biggest waste of money!  My daughter loves Barney, but the picture quality and sound are utterly pathetic, she can't even watch it.  Save yourself the trouble and don't buy this.",1324944000,,260,4.630434782608695

188166,5,1571323848,"When I was younger I adored this film. The other day (12 years on) I was watching some Barney with my cousins and I started to miss this, and I was devastated to the fact I couldn't find it in my house. This is worth a buy.",1313107200,,223,3.765957446808511

188169,5,1571323848,"When reviewing products for kids, I try very hard to review them based on how KIDS like them, not adults, as long as I don't have any strong objections from a moral or educational viewpoints to them.  This video is a perfect example.  For whatever reason, it's been a favorite for YEARS in my house, and not just at Christmastime.  My older son must have watched this about a million times, and lately, we dug it up for my daughter, who is almost 5.  She is autistic and picky about what she watches, but she too is hooked.

The basic story (if there really is one)---Hannah and her family were away until the night before Christmas, and need to decorate quickly.  Some friends come over to help, and Barney gets big when the parents aren't around and helps too.  At one point, there is a visit to Santa Land, complete with some train action.  Of course, there is lots of singing and dancing---some traditional Christmas songs and a few I didn't know well, but do now!

For adults, this is bearable to watch because of the picture-perfectness of the family shown---I have to hold back laughter constantly at the plastic seeming mother and father who, despite their vacation that oddly ended in the evening on Christmas eve, decorate their house within an inch of its life and are all decked out in tacky 80s look Christmas clothes.  It's camp!

There is no religious content here.  When Joy to the World plays, it's cleverly done with sign language instead of vocal signing, to avoid awkward references to anything religious!

So, for both parents and adults, lots of Christmas fun!",1249689600,,1582,4.64748201438849
188170,5,1571323848,"This video is wonderful!  My three-year-old niece watches in amazement, when she's not singing along.  My 6-year-old sister still watches it.  The bonus features are great too.  Definitely a must have.",1195257600,,201,5.387096774193548
188171,5,1571323848,"Super DVD. My two year old granddaughter wants this DVD playing every time she visits. We probably will wear it out. When it finishes she will say ""AGAIN, PLEASE"". She is now signing and dancing along with the music. The colors along with Santa's Work Shop just catch the eye of the little ones. Definitely worth the purchase price.",1192924800,2,332,4.6440677966101696
188172,3,1571323848,"It's a cute movie, but my daughter wasn't interested in it.  I have a 15 month old who loves the Barney tv show, but this movie doesn't have the vibrant colors and obvious joy that the tv show has. This movie would be good for a child who is older, like 3 or 4.",1190419200,,261,3.8333333333333335

188174,4,1571323848,"It looks like it was made in the late 80s early 90s but the songs aren't annoying and my 3 year old daughter likes it enough to ask for it. If you're looking for a ""true message of Christmas"" video, though, this isn't it. In Barney-land, as always, Christmas is about ""sharing"".",1169337600,,278,4.365384615384615

188176,5,1571323848,"My granddaughter is still watching this video after Christmas. She loved it. It's perfect for toddlers. I also purchased the original christmas dvds (Frosty, Rudolf, etc...) and they did not catch her attention as much as Barney and Elmo's christmas dvds. Now if we can just put them away until next christmas would be great.",1168300800,,325,4.927272727272728

I have purchased this for many friends and it has hit a homerun every time. It might be an older DVD but does not look dated in any way. One very minor thing is that the few special effects may not be up to Pixar standards, but it doesn't detract from overall presentation. Buy this one - it's a keeper!",1167350400,4,423,4.170731707317073

188179,5,1571323848,"My 15 month old son LOVES this video.  We bought it before Christmas and he's been watching it since.  Someone likened it to a Barney-Coma, and I agree.  It's like my son is in a trance when he watches this video, and the songs are so catchy my husband and I find ourselves singing them at work.  The only problem is he cries for the remote saying ""Barney"" if it's not playing.  We'll have to get Barney therapy!!! We are now looking for some other Barney tapes he's like as much as this one.",1074902400,11,492,4.191489361702128
188180,5,1571323848,"My daughter, who just turned two at Christmas time, really likes Barney and this video was a big hit.  I personally find it less annoying than other Barney videos for some reason.  Perhaps it's just more acceptable to be sickeningly sweet at holiday time!  My three year old niece also enjoyed watching it.  This year she was old enough that holiday stuff could really be fun (she had fun when she was one but not quite the same) and I liked that she could have the typical things families do at Christmas (decorating, carols, etc.) reinforced in the video.  Anyway - I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a nice holiday video for a small child.",1073260800,7,646,4.5344827586206895

So, if it's holiday time - this is the video that will entertain your child time, after time, after time,....you get the picture.  p.s. It's also educational - like ALL Barney videos.",1024531200,3,327,4.508474576271187

188183,5,1571323848,"Until we got smart and bought this DVD, we spent more renting Barney's Night Before Christmas than the cost to own it. The kids (4 and 2 years old) just love it. It is a year-round entrancer. In addition to the video, the games included on the disc are a very nice bonus. The four-year-old also enjoys listening to the disc in Spanish.",989366400,3,335,4.333333333333333
188184,5,1571323848,"With a creative plot and fun pace, this video gives a warm, happy atmosphere of Christmas.  It's set at Hannah's house, so it's nice to see these kids as ""real"" with a real American house and parents.  Then the kids travel to see Santa at his house and fill his stocking--Santa is beautiful and ideal, as is his workshop.  Two original songs are well written and fun to sing well after the video's over.  Cameo appearances of other Barney cast members give a feeling of togetherness, peace, and goodwill when everyone comes caroling at Hannah's house.
This is a video we'd like to watch year-round.",979862400,5,598,4.666666666666667

188186,5,1571323848,"This tape is absolutely wonderful.  I have to stop my 3 year old from watching it all throughout the summer.  As soon as Halloween is over, she is starting to watch her Christmas tapes and make a Christmas list.  The first Christmas tape that goes in is Barney's Night Before Christmas.  We all enjoy the cute songs, especially the one that they play when they are on an adorable train ride through Santa's workshop.  In the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade, they sang the song on the Barney Float.  It made watching the parade so much fun for not only my daughter, but my husband, myself, and our 13 year old son(12 at the time).  We hope to see it this year.  If you get this tape, you will thoroughly enjoy it.",973987200,8,711,4.374045801526718

This is their 1st Christmas that they sort of understand and this video has been a  wonderful way to introduce/show them all the wonderful things about  Christmas.  My daughter goes nuts when each of the characters show up,  especially Barney!  I have even found myself singing along to the old  Christmas songs that I have forgot until now.  Great addition to our video  collection.",944438400,11,518,4.719101123595506

He doesn't sit to watch the whole tape as he does for lots of other Barney tapes. My 19 month old  son seems to like 'waiting for santa' much better. He watches the entire  show and I can get things done around the house too that way.
