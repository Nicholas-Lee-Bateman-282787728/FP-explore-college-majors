8258382,4,B0015GA134,"I really enjoyed this documentary. The overall history of Prospect Place is fascinating.  The investigators came from a variety of backgrounds and included both believers plus non-believers. My only complaint is that in some parts of this documentary,  there are too many people talking at the same time creating a distraction. This reminded me of a classroom in which a teacher is unable to present her lesson due to too many students talking during the presentation. And, to be honest, I took the segment of ""table tipping"" with a grain of salt. Still, I did enjoy this dvd and you may too.",1520035200,,592,4.794117647058823
