8257383,5,B00153ZQYG,"This documentary will change the way you think about the goods you buy and how close and dangerous illicit trade is.  In a gripping and thought provoking way, this video tells the story of how 'bargain' shopping for knock-off brand name goods can have severe consequences as it provides revenue to criminals.  In  addition to hard hitting stories on human trafficking, counterfeit medicines, and counterfeit luxury items, this video provides an excellent telling of the recent Panamanian cough syrup tragedy where over 100 people died as a consequence of an ingredient in the medicine that was intentionally diluted with anti-freeze so that the perpetrators could make a greater profit.  I have used this video in my company and at pharmaceutical industry conferences to help tell the story of how vulnerable the supply chain is.  With each showing I have had a strong positive response from audience members.  Kudos to National Geographic, the producers and directors for such a fine piece of work!",1244246400,2,999,5.135802469135802
8257384,5,B00153ZQYG,This documentary is riveting. It makes us aware just what it means when we buy a fake handbag and how careful we have to be even about buying medicine from a chemist. Just recently someone was fined in London for selling fake condoms - it sounds funny but would not be if you used one and got pregnant. The film goes into the Panama case where people died because of bad ingredients in cough mixture that came from China and this sort of problem keeps happening. Babies have died in China in the last few months becuse someone thought it would be a good idea to put melamine in milk. People stage riots and demonstrations against globalization involving legitimate goods and services. They should really get angry when they see this film and the ruthless criminal side of globalisation it exposes. It will open your eyes.,1235347200,5,821,4.63013698630137
