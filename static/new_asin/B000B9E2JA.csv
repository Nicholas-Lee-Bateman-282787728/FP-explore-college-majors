8083819,5,B000B9E2JA,This shows what a little tank can do compared to these huge monstrous tanks that the Germans had this want to get in or around streets and below up the Allied personnel in their smaller personnel carriers we should have couple of thousand of those and then snuck up on the big tanks and blown the track off of it it was lightning fast could reach 100 miles an hour zero 200 in less than 25 seconds,1440201600,,397,4.1688311688311686

8083821,3,B000B9E2JA,"When I ordered this I thought it would be a comprehensive survey of the different models of tanks used by the German army in WW II, or at least would show one or two models in depth. Instead the main content was some clips of combat at Kursk and a German combat training film which only briefly showed tanks. Interesting footage, but not what I expected from the title.",1431993600,,369,4.36231884057971
8083822,3,B000B9E2JA,"This video shows a lot of original footage that I have never seen before but there is very little of the film that actually talks about tanks. Most of the DVD is made up of German training films which are good, but speak about tactics and not about the actual armor. There is nothing about the different types of tanks used or any specs, mostly just the two training films. The 1st shows a Panther but no real info on its design, development ect. and the 2nd film shows a few halftracks but again, no info on tanks. I still liked it because of all the rare footage but it really has little to do with Panzers.",1342051200,,609,4.213675213675214
8083823,4,B000B9E2JA,"The video footage from contained in this DVD is primarily from German newsreels from the pre-WW2 and early WW2 period. For this reason they, obviously, make the tanks look as impressive and intimidating as all hell (these films were intended to intimidate diplomatically as much as keep support for the Nazi party as high as possible). There is an impressive footage of not only Panzer 1s and 2s but also of some of the lesser known vehicles albeit the coverage of these two tank types account for about 50 minutes of the DVD's one hour of video.

In terms of educational value, an ""expert"" on WW2 German Panzers would know most of what is on the DVD although there are tidbits of information that are little known. The DVDs real value lies in its informative value to novices. This video, unlike so many documentaries on, say, the History, Discovery or Military channels, provides a very good analysis (albeit in a very dry and monologue British accent) on the the history of these vehicles, their development and their strengths and weaknesses. For the novice a true gem of information.",1265673600,2,1088,4.787234042553192
8083824,4,B000B9E2JA,"Very good dvd. It contains 2 training films with previously unreleased footage. The first film was designed to train crews who were converting to the new Panther medium tank in late 1943. Some really good action shots of the turret interior: it looks like you could stick a couch in there!! The second film takes place in mid 1944 and was made to train small unit commanders how to plan & execute a combined arms (infantry & armor) attack. Again, some really interesting footage that I'd never seen before. The dvd also has some frequently reproduced Kursk footage, fortunately this only takes up a small portion of it.

Anyone thinking of picking this dvd should keep in mind that the film footage is well over 60 years old & isn't up to today's standards so don't expect crystal clear images (even on dvd). Some of it is grainy. With that in mind I think that you'll be pleased with your purchase.",1231545600,5,899,4.583850931677019
8083825,4,B000B9E2JA,"This DVD consists mainly of 2 different reels of authentic German Panzer training. Both are absolutely fascinating and far removed from the typical stock footage found in most WWII documentaries. War: The Archive Collection has proven to be a valuable set of documentaries for this reason alone, these DVDs have been produced using alot of footage most people have never seen.

After a general overview of Panzer combat that lasts about 10 minutes, you'll view the first of the 2 training reels. This consists of some open field combat tactics using a Panther Tank to root out Soviet soldiers hiding in fox holes scattered about the field. You are literally shown, using a Panther Tank, the proper way to collapse a fox hole with a soldier inside.

The 2nd training reel is a little different. It mixes some cartoon diagrams in with actual real combat training to show some rather complicated frontline combat utilizing a nearby forest treeline, while being numerically outnumbered. Mostly includes halftracks, including a detachment of Flame-throwing Halftracks. Absolutely fantastic.

I would give this 5 stars, except most of this documentary has the original German narration, but there are no added English Subtitles, so I have no idea what he's saying throughout probably 35 minutes of this 50 minute Documentary. Otherwise this particular DVD documentary is very strong and recommended.",1194307200,10,1393,5.237668161434978
8083826,5,B000B9E2JA,This DVD is made up of period combat/newsreel footage of German WWII Panzer I and II tanks with documentary-style narration providing specific details. The footage is for the most part very good and the DVD provides interesting info on both tanks as well as a history of armored warfare leading into the formation of the German Panzer arm. As with the other DVD's in this series the video footage isn't of the best quality but it is exactly what you would expect from film shot during the 30's and 40's (it is not modern video footage of surviving tank examples). In my opinion this DVD is well worth the price and would be perfect for anyone interested in modern military history or even as reference material for scale modelling. I highly recommend it!,1190419200,6,754,4.676691729323308
