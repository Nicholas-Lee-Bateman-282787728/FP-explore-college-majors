Next movie for her are the CIA movies or other black ops movies/heists with Jason Statham as her partner...",1396569600,7,225,4.6

6316301,5,B00J2MQ06U,I love this movie so much! She is my inspiration! Sad that not a lot of people know HER tho :(. But still this is The Best Movie Ever! My All Time Favorite!,1509926400,,156,3.757575757575758
6316302,5,B00J2MQ06U,Its a great movie. I recommend,1508544000,,30,4.166666666666667
6316303,4,B00J2MQ06U,Gina Carano is believable as a Bad A**. Better than most action movies.  I looked up more Gina Carano movies after seeing this one.,1506816000,,131,4.458333333333333

6316306,1,B00J2MQ06U,This is one of the worst movies ever made. Haywire was good; this is just an empty effort to play on her performance in Haywire. The storyline was stupid at best--completely illogical and unexplained jumps that made it difficult to follow what was happening. Keep your money; do not pay for this movie.,1504137600,,302,4.716981132075472
6316307,4,B00J2MQ06U,"Its different, but keeps you involved.  With such an all star cast I was a bit sad that more of their acting skills were not used to what we all know of the cast and there pedigree of acting. as most have said, the fight scenes with Gina Carano were very good, a nice element of realism involved.",1503446400,,296,4.103448275862069

6316309,4,B00J2MQ06U,"Very entertaining.  Gina Garano is great at this.  I would have loved the movie, but there is a part (without giving anything away) that was quite absurd.  Giving in and saying ""okay, fine, whatever,"" makes the movie a fun diversion.",1503100800,,233,4.775
6316310,5,B00J2MQ06U,Unrealistic plot but the action scenes have concrete authenticity about them since the lead actress is/was a real MMA fighter who knocks people unconscious with her hands for a living so the choreography and fights are riveting and believable to watch even if the plot isn't.,1502409600,,275,5.0

6316315,5,B00J2MQ06U,"Gina Carano; what more needs to be said. Watch her fighting skills on various YouTube videos and you'll see why this beautiful, talented actress does almost all of her own stunts in this exciting and entertaining movie. Movie moves along at a good clip with plenty of suspense and action. With a wife like Gina who needs a bodyguard? Her husband in this movie was one lucky fellow to have married her (you'll see what I mean) Be sure to watch her other movie ""Haywire"", also available through Amazon.com.",1489276800,2,504,4.674157303370786

6316319,4,B00J2MQ06U,"I am not an MMA follower, so when I watched this movie I was impressed enough with Gina Carano to research her background. Her athletic prowess coupled with beauty and clear acting talent deserves the 4-star rating I gave it. I hope I see more of her work.

6316332,5,B00J2MQ06U,"If you understand the genre you are getting into - Gina Carano kicking butt - then you should really like this movie.  There is actually an engaging plot between the action sequences and ultimately, for a solution out of left field, it makes some sense.  Great sense of place in the Caribbean with well-staged action sequences.

The reason I said funky is that she doesn't show much emotion and appears so mellow about life in general.  Probably because she knows she can

6316379,5,B00J2MQ06U,"The movie begins with Ava dressing in a wedding gown and her future sister-in-law assuring her that from now on she will have a new family.  Flashbacks indicate that Ava's own childhood was pretty weird, with a mercenary/gangbanger/cult leader (I never did decide what he was) father teaching her about what pain is like and how to give everything you've got.  We decided that even though Ava (Gina Carano) is marrying into a rich family, she has secrets in her past that are returning for some reason, to trouble her today.  Director John Stockwell is recalling visually the wedding at the beginning of The Deer Hunter, only a little bit more subtle.  I didn't even know who Gina Carano was, but as every fan knows, she is like nobody else in the movies, and I began wondering why the movie was focusing in on this one girl and why, whenever she opened her mouth, it seemed like a different actress was speaking through her.(often Sally Kellerman and some other actress much older than she must be).

Because the movie is called ""In the Blood"" we figured that the movie would involve Gina Carano discovering that she is carrying the DNA of her evil, violent, perverted father (Stephen Lang) in her blood, and that somehow she would wreak favor and destroy the white-bread family she was moving into.  You could see Treat Williams asking his son (five minutes before the wedding) what he knew about the girl's history, her past, her criminal record.  But then the film turned a dazzling crystal color and the groom stepped into the light and he was Cam Gigandet, finally landing a suitable role after his triumph playing ""Jack"" in Burlesque, the tragic musical that it now appears, in the kind light of history, was 2010's best film and possibly of the whole 21st century.  Yes, Cam Gigandet, though he no longer sports Jack's signature derby or fedora or whatever that hat Joel Grey wore in Cabaret, the bartender in Burlesgue who cynically welcomes Christina Aguilera to Los Angeles while Cher sings ""Welcome to Burlesque"" at her failing downtown nightclub.  Cynical, yes, but a heart of gold and when he sees Ali Rose (Christina) stuck homeless in a rainstorm, he impulsively invites her into his apartment and they will be chaste roommates sparring over his bad habits, her ambition, and his charming trait of walking through his living room naked a the day God made him in France or wherever.  But now he marries Gina Carano and a whole new epic romance awaits him.  The nice sister kisses her passionately as the young couple embarks on a honeymoon to what is evidently Puerto Rico but which the script claims is an ""island off Puerto Rice,"" I suppose because it is so poverty stricken and violent that the real Puerto Rico might sue.  And the montage of a great honeymoon takes up the next ten minutes of the movie, I loved it.

Tragically enough, however, Gina and Cam become embroiled in some local politics, corrupt cops, and a zip-line attraction that is a one way ticket to certain death.  I can't explain any further about ""In the Blood"" without revealing the huge twist in the plot, only to say that I was wrong, Gina Carano does not turn evil or become a vampire or any of the scenarios the opening sequences had prepared me for.  I just want to add a few words about her, sometimes she resembles a smaller version of the actress who was Jayne Mansfield's daughter, but much younger and toned like gold in the Puerto Rican sun.  Even sweaty and with carrying a flick knife in her teeth, her clothes torn and her hair lopsided, she is ravishing to behold and never ever makes a move unworthy of a star.  You can't take your eyes off of her and lucky, talented Cam Gigandet, who together make up the best screen couple since, well, he starred in Burlesque with Christina Aquilera and taught her that not all jaded wannabe songwriters are bad.  Let the critics and Rotten Tomatoes type of people sneer at her accent and her habit of reading from cue cards mounted slightly to the right side of the camera, we were asking ourselves, Who is this amazing vital creature and what other movies can we see her in?  It has been a week of binging ever since and I am still infatuated with this magnificent, multi-careered action star.  What other actresses (and actors) get from drama school and perhaps from inherent talent, she gets from klcking  down doors barefeet, bleeding from the scalp, T-shirt ripped in ten places, valiant as Norma Shearer in Romeo and Juliet, and what she won't do for her Romeo!  And somehow it works.",1436832000,,4534,4.662484316185696
6316380,1,B00J2MQ06U,"I rented this because I really liked Haywire but I was disappointed and do not recommend this - the plot simply did not make any sense plus the movie was slow in the beginning -  there was really no explanation as to why she was such a badass fighter except for some Incomprehensible scene with her father(?) -  and her husband was kidnapped to provide stem cells (!) to the bad guy?!

6316394,3,B00J2MQ06U,"In the Blood is an action thriller and a very average one at that. The film is not great. It is not bad, either. Even so, there are two things that are worth watching: beautiful Puerto Rican locations and the star Gina Carano.

Gina Carano plays Ava, a newly-married woman with some dark past. During her honeymoon in the Caribbean, her husband Derek (Cam Gigandet) goes missing after a terrible accident. The hospital staff knows nothing about him. The local police are not helpful. So Ava decides to find him on her own.

The films story is not very unique, and most supporting players including Danny Trejo and Luis Guzman are typecast, but the real problem of In the Blood is that Gina Carano, MMA star-turned-actress, is not allowed to show what she is capable of. The film simply needs someone, either villain or partner, who can match her fighting skills. There are a few fight scenes, but they are too few and short. Also, the flashback scenes (in which Stephen Lang appears as Avas father) add little to the by-the-numbers story and could well have been either left out or else elaborated upon.

In the Blood is directed by John Stockwell responsible for films like Into the Blue starring Paul Walker and Jessica Alba, and maybe this will let you know how I felt during the course of about 110 minutes. The film is beautiful to look at (and zip-line sequence is thrilling), but as an action movie it is only mildly entertaining.",1429574400,,1437,4.649606299212598

6316400,5,B00J2MQ06U,"Perhaps the most surprising thing about this movie is the fact that, though it was a virtually straight-to-home-video product featuring an assortment of B-level actors, it's actually a very watchable and good film.  In fact, as an entry in the genre, I would call it excellent.

The only real shortcomings I could point out to you are shortcomings inherent to the whole action/suspense genre itself, which are things not likely to be noticed or fretted over by people who enjoy the action/suspense genre itself.  The main reason to watch a movie like this is for a suspenseful plot that grabs ahold of one's attention, and is punctuated by some slick fight scenes.  If you go in expecting great insights about the hypocrisies of our times, or enriching moral edification, you will be disappointed.  If, however, you merely ask to watch Gina Carano totally kick the crap out of a few guys while moving through a tight, attention-grabbing storyline . . .  I dare say you are likely to be pleasantly surprised by this film.",1425945600,,1020,4.833333333333333
6316401,3,B00J2MQ06U,"Gina Carano really gets to stretch her acting chops in ""In the Blood"" even more than in her surprisingly excellent acting debut in ""Haywire"". Too bad ""In the Blood"" isn't even half the movie overall that ""Haywire"" was but it's not bad by any means either. The film is about a half hour too long and with some tighter editing and a better flow between acting set pieces, it could have been much more than it is. But if you're as big of a fan of Gina Carano as I am, this movie has a lot to offer. First off, she looks positively stunning throughout the film in a variety of outfits that always accentuate how amazingly fit and toned her body is. While there is no nudity, she does show a lot of skin though I wouldn't say it is gratuitous. The action scenes while haphazardly edited give her a chance to show off some amazingly brutal moves and finishes. Also as I already mentioned, she delivers quite a good performance which puts her a notch above most modern action stars regardless of gender. Hopefully she will get another chance to work with another accomplished filmmaker again at some point such as in ""Haywire"". The supporting cast is pretty good with genre favorites Luis Guzman and Danny Trejo having roles. The film was shot digitally and the bluray details are exemplary.  Plot is basic in that Gina's character who is newly married loses track of her husband on a tropical island after a zip lining accident. Your enjoyment of this film will depend a lot on how much you like Gina Carano.

The flashback sequences to would-be heroine Ava's training with her father are the most interesting scenes in the film and they suddenly stop halfway through. This is just abysmal filmmaking.

6316454,3,B00J2MQ06U,"Gina Carano still can't act, but never mind. Her ""acting"" isn't why I latch onto the few films she's got under her belt. Boil down Gina Carano to the essence that draws in her fans like flies, and it's this: badass chick with a pretty face and a sweet smile dispensing brutal beatdowns on dudes. During bits where she woodenly delivers her lines, I abide with the patience of a saint and, probably, I'm checking my cell phone for missed messages.

Derek and Ava, two ex-junkies in love. Derek (Cam Gigandet) and Ava (Carano) met in rehab and bonded and here they are now honeymooning on an island just off the coast of Puerto Rico. Derek comes from wealth and entitlement but he loves his bride, to the extent that he's told off his dad (Treat Williams) who suspects Ava of mooching off the family fortune. Ava's survived a nightmarish upbringing in which she was tortured and taught to fight by her lunatic father (Stephen Lang).

It's gotten so I don't want to holiday overseas anymore. How many terror tales have you heard where Americans travel to some exotic place and get their crap abducted or tortured or other horrible things? On the island the newlyweds are approached by a sociable local and are talked into a ziplining expedition in the rainforest. Suspended hundreds of feet above, Derek falls and sustains serious injuries. And I don't know about you, but when the medical response team refuses to allow a relative to ride in the ambulance, the needle leaps to the red on my W.T.F. gauge. Ava is forced to trail along, but when she arrives at the hospital half an hour later, no one had seen her husband.

I like that Ava doesn't immediately launch into asskicking mode. She does the logical if torturous thing. She visits all the hospitals and clinics. She goes to the police. She revisits the ziplining site. And when all that proves fruitless, THEN she goes bananas. In a movie that's full of silly and wack, it's nice that some p's and q's are minded. Think of Liam Neeson's Taken, only gender reversed. In the Blood is Gina's nabbing her second lead role (after Haywire), and it's a step back. Think what you will of Haywire - folks have dumped on it - but that was a Steven Soderbergh production. In the Blood is strictly B-flick escapism that's eventually sunk by sad production values and poor choices by director John Stockwell. I can put a finger on two positives: Gina Carano still has those all-purpose beatdown skills and Luis Guzmn (the police chief) and Amaury Nolasco (the big bad) are wonderfully sleazy.

Liam Neeson made this such a boss premise. Gina just doesn't have Neeson's acting chops, even though she tries hard. But she only ever seems natural when she's digging an elbow into someone's floating ribs. As for other faults in the flick, I've a bunch in random order:

- I don't believe even Gina Carano is so badass she can cut a bloody swathe across the island barrios while in flip flops.
- One goon is shot a full dose of an anesthesia (Propofol) that completely wears off in minutes.
- Same guy gets a bullet in the leg but is running around with no limp minutes later.
- I know they needed to set up why Ava can fight so well, but those flashbacks of her dad training her are simply unwatchable, mostly because those scenes are poorly done and require more context. Was her dad just batsh-- crazy or was there actual method to his madness?
- One flashback I could've done with is a scene of Derek and Ava meeting in rehab.
- It's a bit ridiculous that Derek's family would show up at the island but then take off after only a few days and with Derek still missing.

I originally had the randomness of the reason for Derek's abduction on that above list, but, on second thought, it's sort of neat that they would throw that in there. It's one moment of straying from routine plotting.

Basically, the film wastes too much time with scenes of Carano not clobbering dudes. The delivery of her fight scenes could've been more expertly staged. Some of the action suffers from excessive cutting and, in the case of the dance club brawl, extreme strobing. Still, Gina remains a convincing physical presence. You believe that she CAN take out those burly hombres. I love that sequence when a handcuffed Ava must escape during an escorted bathroom visit while on the ferry. What else? Danny Trejo is wasted, but I enjoyed the character arc of Manny (Ismael Cruz Cordova), the sociable local who invited Ava and Derek to go ziplining. Another thing they get right is that teenage flashback Ava (Paloma Olympia Louvat) bears a good likeness to Carano. I never did get what I wanted to see most in the film: the payoff of Ava giving her disapproving father-in-law his painful comeuppance. Treat Williams, you got off lucky.",1409443200,2,4757,4.622485207100592
6316455,5,B00J2MQ06U,"Someone took a child and manufactured a monster! Oh my God, this had to have been the toughest woman I've ever seen! While Zoe Saldana's Cateleya Restrepo was a stealth and ambush killer, Gina Carano's Ava was a fighter, a ruthless fighter. I can imagine that if these two ladies met up and went against their enemies they would have their foemen begging for mercy; they would receive none, however.

The fight at the club in the beginning of the movie showed it all. There Ava breaks a poor man's arm while beating up three women, including ruining one pretty blondes face by smashing a glass down on her cheek! That would have required 30 stitches to suture! But in the end it's her husband that she seeks to protect.

I won't ruin the plot save to say that Ava is absolutely dangerous! But it's her tenacity that puts me in awe of the character! Whether it's her jumping into the Atlantic to swim to shore (Never Mind Sharks) or her guile in gaining access to a hotel room in order to clean up after that swim or using her feminine wiles to get a man to lower his guard in a bathroom-I was astounded.

This is a great strong woman's movie. I recommend it to any woman who wants to see a well written female role. Too often women are only damsels in distress. That's not the case here. If anything the husband is the damsel in this movie as he is the one that always needs rescuing. Buy this movie and you won't be disappointed.

6316458,4,B00J2MQ06U,"While her acting skills could still use some polish (mostly in delivering her dialogue), watching Gina Carano in an action film is refreshing.  It is one of those rare occasions where they put an attractive woman in an action role and it doesn't feel like they took some eye candy and showed her some martial arts moves.  Carano can sell the action like a boss and the fight scenes alone in this are worth the price of admission.  Throw in a fairly talented supporting cast, a beautiful backdrop for the story, and this wound up being a surprisingly entertaining action flick.  I hope more producers and directors take note of Carano's performance because, like in Haywire, she proved how a strong female protagonist can and should carry a movie like this.",1408752000,,756,4.748091603053435

Gina Carano does a good imitation of an action star, she isn't 007 or Jason Bourne but she holds her own. The best part of this movie is the storyline, it actually makes sense. As I sit here writing this review I am watching it again. Luis Guzman plays his part very well and Danny Trejo is barely in this movie although he is a central character. If you are an action fan like me you will enjoy seeing this more than once. If Gina Carano choses she can be one of the top female action stars of the years to come. Here hand to combat skills, along with her gun play puts her in line with what you have seen in fast and furious movies.",1408579200,,731,3.945945945945946

Anyway, this movie does not show her off as well as Haywire, but it's still fun to watch. It's almost like FarCry 3, except with a female as the protagonist. But they really could have done a better job of showing how talented Ms. Carano is in all of the fight scenes in this movie. I liked her better in the very short screen time she had in the recent Fast/Furious film. She's a very good actress, too. So watch this movie, but look for better stuff, too.

6316471,4,B00J2MQ06U,"After watching three awful mysteries that weren't mysteries, this movie was a treat in that it delivered what it promised.

Gina Carano is a the daughter of an outlaw who taught her the art of nasty fighting and never quitting.  She gets married and goes to the Caribbean for her honeymoon.  While enjoying paradise, her husband goes missing, the cops are useless, and everyone starts looking at her for murder.

So, the pretty, formidable, former MMA star does what she does best and goes medieval on everyone who gets in her way - corrupt cops, corrupt doctors, corrupt gangsters, and corrupt zip line operators.  She is a one-woman wrecking crew.

This is a low-budget ""Taken"" if Liam Neeson were a hot, brunette babe.

The fight scenes do not seem totally unrealistic, given the genre, because Carano's moves are the moves of someone who knows what she's doing. More importantly, Carano is a decent actress. Carano's performance is not wooden, the character comes across as a real person, and she does have a range of emotions.

The action does get brutal - I winced a few times as some villain was dispatched in some way or another and the body count runs high.  But, hey!, it's an action adventure flick.and body count comes with the territory.

All in all, it is a bit of mindless entertainment to burn an evening.",1406246400,2,1321,4.729257641921397

6316476,3,B00J2MQ06U,"A few years ago I watched former ultimate fighter Gina Carano kick numerous ""A-List"" actor's butts in a film called ""Haywire.""  I loved the film and her in it.  After another supporting role in ""Fast & Furious 6"" she gets her first lead in this boilerplate ""B"" movie.  With a story similar to ""Taken,"" the just married Ava (Carano) and her new husband Derek (Cam Gigandet) head off to a Spanish speaking Caribbean Island.  The island is never named but it is surely the Dominican Republic (filmed in Puerto Rico).

Raised by her criminal father (Stephen Lang), Ava was taught how to fight and survive in case he wasn't around anymore.  Shown in flashback, we see some of the difficulties Ava encountered.  Now she's happy and is on her honeymoon but has a wealthy and suspicious father-in-law (Treat Williams).  This subplot never makes any sense, but fortunately doesn't take up much time.  While at a local disco, one of the bad guy leaders (Danny Trejo) engages Ava on the dance floor.  When hubby moves in, he's taken out by local henchmen.  That switches on Ava, who goes into full battle mode.  This scene could have been terrific as Carano really knows how to fight.  But the scene is poorly edited and we are flooded with blinding disco lights.  Too bad.

After things settle down, the next day the honeymooners decide to head out to the zip-line.  Derek falls and on the way to the hospital, he disappears.  Ava seeks help from the local police chief (Luis Guzman), but he seems reluctant to get involved.  So Ava takes her `certain set of skills' on the trail to find Derek.  Her character is the same one we see Jason Statham portray in just about every movie he's in.  The movie has a terrible script, the acting is pretty bad and much of it just doesn't make much sense.  Still watching Carano in action is fun enough for me.

I watched this film on a perfectly acceptable Blu ray.  The transfer is 1080p as most are and the aspect ratio is 1.85:1 which will fill most screens.  The picture is full of color most of the time, as you might expect in a film shot in the Caribbean.  Several scenes come in various portable media including ""Go-Pro"" cameras, cell phones so there are certain limitations.  Flesh-tones are good, but black levels don't quite get black enough on occasion.  The audio includes a Dolby TrueHD 5.1 lossless track.  It is very good, including some scenes involving heavy music (club) which spread out the sound across the speakers.  Dialog is properly centered and consistent.  An immersive and aggressive soundtrack.  Subtitles are available in Spanish and English SDH.  The only extra is a behind the scenes featurette.  There is also a DVD and a UV copy.",1405555200,4,2692,4.659574468085107

6316478,3,B00J2MQ06U,"Let me just say right off the bat that Gina Carano, not Gal Gadot should be playing Wonder Woman in the Batman/Superman film.  She has the beauty, the physique, and action chops.  With that out of the way lets turn to In the Blood which is Caranos second lead feature after 2011s surprisingly good Haywire.  Unfortunately things don't go quite as well in this film but that can be attributed to a dull script from James Robert Johnston and Bennett Yellin.

Carano plays Ava, a recovering drug user who marries wealthy Derek Grant (Gigandet), a fellow former substance abuser.  The pair head for a Honeymoon in the Caribbean to a tiny remote island which can only mean trouble.  They have a run-in with some local thugs at a night club including the ubiquitous Danny Trejo as Big Biz.  Ava has to rescue her husband, surprising him with her fighting ability as she mops the floor with the tough guys.  Now, the average guy might wonder where his wife acquired her butt-kicking skills but Derek blows it off as if he happened to discover a tattoo that hed never seen before.  The only explanation we get for her skills are a few flashbacks to her as a young woman training with her father in a homemade dojo.  I love Danny Trejo and hes much better as a villain than a hero but after his scene in the nightclub he promptly disappears until the last 10 minutes of the film and thus is all but wasted.

The following day Derek is hurt in a zipline accident and taken to a local hospital.  When Ava reaches the hospital the nurse at the front desk claims that her husband never arrived there.  Ava desperately searches for her missing husband, getting no help from the local police chief (Luis Guzman).  In fact Ava soon comes under suspicion from the police and Dereks family as having been involved in his disappearance.  Ava eventually finds her husbands kidnappers and their reason for abducting him is one of the most inane plot devices I have encountered in a long time.  The poor attempt at building a backstory is completely bungled.  Were shown brief flashbacks of a troubled you and her father murdered but nothing ever comes of it.

In the Blood is at its best when Carano is allowed to do her thing and kick ass, and she does it extremely well.  As a mixed martial artist her fights in the film are more brutal and look less choreographed than other female action stars.  The first 20 minutes and the last 20 minutes are the reasons to watch the film.  The problem is the hour in-between.  Director John Stockwell, who helmed the awful Seal Team Six: The Raid on Osama Bin Laden gives Carano little to do in the middle.  She travels from point to point as if its a videogame and shes trying to collect all of the pickups even if she doesnt need them.  Caranos lack of emotional range makes some of these dramatic scenes almost painful to watch, especially when Dereks father (Treat Williams) accusers her of being responsible for his sons disappearance and she can muster little more than a mumble as she sulks away.  This isn't a knock on Carino as much as it is Stockwell and the writers who put her in a no-win situation.",1405382400,,3131,4.518650088809947

6316480,3,B00J2MQ06U,"Gina Carano is beautiful, non-anorexic and a damn good action figure. She has reasonable acting skills which can be honed over time. My problem with her movies are their endings. Haywire ended with a fizzle not a bang. Why did we not see her take the ultimate bad guy out and why did he not have a strong body guard presents so we could see some good action in the end? We were left to imagine her taking down the ultimate villain of the movie. O.K so that was Haywire, which was all-in-all a reasonably good movie except for the ending.

Now In The Blood seemed to have run out of money and they just wrapped it up without much thought. The end fight scenes were below Gina. The ending was unrealistic. The bad guy never kills any of the snitches and people hiding her? The show was reasonable (not great) until it plummeted into c grade in the last 20 minutes.
I have this movie in my cart for about a month now, because I really like Gina, but cannot get myself to order it because I keep remembering those awful last 20 minutes.

Gina I know you are new to the Biz, but get a new agent and try getting some quality projects. You are too talented, beautiful and unique in your fighting and body image to settle for this.

They soon find a guide that takes them to a bar where she catches the eye of a man(Danny Trejo) and wants to dance with her. When she and her husband fend off his advances, she shows them she is not to be trifled with and does a number on several of the men and a few women, They are whisked away by their guide and decide to put it all behind them and continue their honeymoon. The next day they are taken to several places on the island and one particular place which she is not too sure about, a zip line that is more than a mile long. While she hangs back her husband decides he wants to try it unfortunately the straps break and he plunges into the forest where she discovers him badly injured. An ambulance arrives and takes him to the hospital but once there, she learns that he is not there, nor can she find him anywhere. Going to the police, they immediately question her, believing she might have killed him in a rage, after all they do have evidence that she can more than handle herself. Seeking help from her in laws, they attempt to find him only to have her father-in-law question her also believing she might have killed him for their money. Alone and with no one to trust, she must now find out what happened to her husband but she is thwarted every step of the way by the disappearance of her guide and the people that suddenly do no know her.

She does a great job considering what she's given to work with.  If she can keep doing stuff like she did in the first big fight scene and not let them turn it ""Hollywoody"", great.  She is totally convincing when she can go ""no-holds-barred"" and gets the job done.  I hope she will always have input into the fight choreography so she isn't forced to use wires or do those stupid high kicks and stuff that the studios always seem to want.  It really trashes a movie.  I also like her girl-next-door kind of beauty.  It makes her seem approachable and even a little vulnerable.  That makes what she does in the fights even more amazing.  I've given up on Segal (long ago), Lundgren, and van Damme.  It's great to see Carano taking over.  I took off one star because Gina needs some training with firearms.

I'd give this film a wholehearted recommendation except the ending feels a little tacked on designed to please an audience instead of making a statement.  For a good three-quarters or four-fifths of the way through the film is a thoughtful meditation on violence only to give way to routine action formula.  John Stockwell's film recalls Sam Peckinpah the difference being that Peckinpah had the courage of his convictions trusting the audience and allowing his films to follow their logical conclusion.

6316503,3,B00J2MQ06U,"After seeing & enjoying Gina Carano's first starring vehicle, ""Haywire"", I was looking forward to her next project.  Had I not approached it as a fan of martial arts I think I would've been quite fond of it.  It's not bad and is fairly well made, with Gina's acting coming along nicely.  No, she won't be nominated by the academy this year, but she's more than serviceable.

Gina plays Ava, a girl raised by her father (Stephen Lang, ""Avatar""), himself a low-level criminal, to be completely self-reliant.  After occupational hazard marks his demise, she spends the rest of her adolescence testing his methods.  Life changes when she meets Derek (Cam Gigandet, ""Never Back Down"") in rehab and her life is given new meaning.  Despite the protests from his wealthy family, they get married.  While spending their honeymoon on an undisclosed tropical island near Puerto Rico, Derek disappears.  No one on the island seems to have a clue what happened to the dude, and his father (Treat Williams, ""Once Upon a Time in America"") suspects that Ava is trying to cash in on the family fortune.

I thought I was in for major disappointment when the opening brawl in a nightclub is shown entirely under the strobe-lights and nothing can be seen.  Though that was a problem that would not be repeated in the film, the short, one-sided nature of the ensuing fights was only of minor consolation.  As Ava realizes that no one is going to help her and that a few folks in town may know a little more than they're letting on, she decides to kick her investigation up a notch.  While Gina looks good doing this, not enough attention is placed on her fighting ability (isn't that why she was cast?) and most, if not all, of the fisticuffs looks like it could've been performed by anyone. That being said, there are still tense (and often extremely violent) moments of excitement.

The supporting cast is well chosen, though we could stand a little more time from Stephen Lang, Treat Williams, and I suppose, even the seemingly unavoidable Danny Trejo (""Machete"").  Veteran character-actor Luis Guzman (""Boogie Nights"") as the police chief and Amaury Nolasco (""The Rum Diary"") as gang-leader Silvio help make up for it with great performances.  Rookie actor Ismael Cruz Cordova (""White Alligator"") also adds a bit of fun and mystery as Ava & Derek's friend Manny.

The DVD from Anchor Bay is in English with some Spanish, with English or Spanish subtitles.  Widescreen ratio of 1.85:1.  Running time of 108 minutes.  Special Features include a ""making of"" documentary.  Directed by John Stockwell (""Turistas"").

All-in-all this was a decent enough thriller.  Longer, more competently filmed fight scenes would've helped but I liked it well enough, even watching it twice.  The climax loses a bit of momentum through increased absurdity, more because of presentation than plot.  I still look forward to Ms. Carano's next project, though I think her particular set of skills could be more intelligently utilized.  3.5 out of 5 stars.

6316504,2,B00J2MQ06U,This movie only vaguely made any sense and overall was not very good. The few action sequences were filmed so you could not completely see what was going on. The heroine misses opportunity after opportunity to take out the bad guys but let's them go only to have them end up trying to kill her. Her husband's rich father offers a reward and then leaves which didn't make sense either. I expected him to bring in a small army to find his son.

Danny Trejo's part is crowbarred into the film, which stinks.  Not developed well at all.  He is a Deus Ex Machina.  So why should you watch this action movie with a story that is far from perfect?

Gina Carano.  When the action starts--and it starts often--she explodes onto the scene.  This movie demonstrates very well how effective MMA techniques are in a real fight.  Rarely over-the-top, but ALWAYS impressive and brutal.  From perfect elbows to leg kicks to armbars to ground-and-pound--this movie's action is exciting and realistic!  Wow!  Gina Carano is THAT good in EVERY action scene.  I promise.

While Gina Carano is gorgeous, she is never objectified.  Her acting is very good, but a bit stiff and expressionless at times.  She is going to be the complete entertaining package when she masters acting.

Now I've got the blu-ray ordered and rented it here on Amazon too. In the Blood really brings me back to the badass action/revenge movies of the 80s and 90s (especially with the quick, dirty, brutal fights like Seagal) with a more contemporary vicious edge.  Once the action and emotions begin running high, I think Ms Carano has come along nicely in terms of her acting, she handles the emotional scenes well too, certainly better than a vast majority of action stars.

  It is excellent to finally see a believable female action hero. Carano actually has muscles, speed, and timing and doesn't need the usual Hollywood actor short-cuts like nauseating quick-cuts, stunt doubles, or a vast suspension of disbelief in their fights (like Angelina Jolie and Milla Jovovich do). The film its self is a satisfying yet sometimes unsettling revenge/rescue plot that pushes all the right buttons...and some you might wish it hadn't.  There is a particular scene in which you know the guy is a scum-bag who tries to have our heroine killed by to cover his corrupt tracks and likely would again if she had left him alive...but you still feel a little queasy about how he meets his end.  But that's kind of the point, revenge is a messy business, this does not however prevent you from rooting for Ava (Carano's character).  The ending comes a little out of the blue but isn't completely unfeasible.

Ava must go ""walking tall"" all over a poor tropical island while being sought by the police.

Gina Carano is a more convincing tough girl than the models and twinkies who have played those roles. The film is fairly formulaic except it does have some welcomed unexpected twists. Danny Trejo is on the screen far less than Ismael Cruz Cordova, but you might ask who the heck is Ismael Cruz Cordova.

Honestly I think the problem is all in the script and writing.. if Gina had a well-written script with an actual compelling storyline, she could probably carry a ""female Jack Reacher"" type of movie. This one is seems like a hastily thrown-together plot that isn't even well thought out. By the time it ends you don't really care about what happens; even the honeymoon couple aren't developed as characters at all. Gina's torturing and killing people seems odd when she's not even sure what happened to her husband... at least in Taken, Liam Neeson knew his daughter had been kidnapped. All Gina knows is her husband fell off a zip line and disappeared afterwards. Especially bizarre is her threatening a police officer's sleeping child, and then making the cop commit suicide, when all he was guilty of was giving her false information. I'm a Gina fan, but she really needs a good script to come her way, keep working on the acting (this is much better than Haywire), and before long she'll be a solid action star. I agree with the reviewer who said she could be the female Steven Seagal. Oh, it's also strange how much texting goes on in this film! Everyone is texting - the screen constantly goes to closeups of texts the bad guys are sending each other, texts Gina is looking at, and cell phone screenshots.

That fight scene between her and Ms. Rodriguez was sexy, brutal, and so in your face with action. The character she played in that movie seemed to fit her personality, so it was well acted.

2.  In this movie, you can definitely tell she is still a rookie with acting and that's ok. I think it just seemed worse because of the low budget of the film.

3.  Oh man, Mr. Nolasco with his sexy Puertorican butt made the film bearable!  Oh how I cried, when 'Chase' ended.  His truly is a damn good actor and it showed in this film, even though others around him weren't too good.

4.  This film may have been better if Ms. Carano played a FBI agent, Police Officer or Soldier searching for her missing son or daughter or hubby.

She just has this dominating body language, so the character she plays in this movie just doesn't work.  Haywire was good because the role she played fit her.  The same with Fast & Furious.

Oh, and with men groping her every other scene or the threatening nature of rape just doesn't work for me in this film.  It makes the film seem that much cheaper. Even the scene with her father just doesn't work and seemed unbelievable.
The plot was somewhat different so...ugh! Mr. Nolasco is so yummy!

6316546,2,B00J2MQ06U,"Gina is very skilled, beautiful, and a nice person all around. Nothing really like she portrays in movies, I've watched many interviews with her. Very cool. Much like Jet Li, Steven Seagal, Juan Claude Van Dam, Chuck Norris etc. She is a B movie, straight to DVD kind of actress. In this movie she has a ""little"" more dialogue than in Fast 6 and Haywire, but that's not saying much. She does cry and show emotion pretty good as well. But the movie just drags along, first a typical honeymoon, then a barfight scence to set things up to go wrong. Then as seen in the previews (her hubby falls to his death). Then she seeks out to find out how and why. There are some creative moments in the film. But others just don't make sense, not to spoil anything but she wants all this revenge before she even knows whether or not her husband is actually dead. And she seeks it, and gets it, for the most part. But she's arrested, takes out cops, threatens the main policemans 8 year old daughter with a gun (while sleeping). Then goes off just killing everyone in site. She basically has no sympathy. Which is a little odd to watch. Especially certain seens where she actually tortures a few people.

So basically it's a like a much more violent ""Taken"", but without just provocation. Once you reach the end of the film you're left asking, why did she do all this? Was it really that big of a deal? That is ""the twist at the end"", which seemed very trivial to me. And with a very drawn out ending. Danny Trajeo who was in the movie for like a total of 8 minutes seemed very pointless to me as well. He probably only filmed his parts for about an hour. So it's just the basic, I want revenge, even though I'm not ""sure"" exactly if I should be doing this type of deal/movie. At least that's what I took away from it. I think Gina Carano has much more talent, and should be cast in much better roles than just fight films. She would be ""one of the few"". But the way I see it she's paved this ""way of the bad A##"" image for herself. So that's what film makers are going to cash in on. That's why this is out only in very few theaters. And coming to DVD in just a few weeks. And Amazon Instant Watch. Haywire was ok as well, but not really outstanding either.

Going from womens MMA pioneer to Hollywood action heroine is a tough leap, but each time I see her, I really think Gina Carano has gotten better as an actress. Mallory Cane was ok and all as a character in her last film, Haywire, but I feel that Hollywood hasn't really found the right niche for Gina Carano. I think this character she plays in In The Blood is a better fit for her than Mallory Kane as it showed off not Gina's awesome fighting skills, but also her natural charm and beautiful smile. And my god is that woman stacked. She is truly built like an Amazon. I think of her in a Wonder Woman costume and only imagine what could have been. Gina Carano has the potential to be a great female action hero given the right vehicle. If anything what I felt this movie lacked was well....more Gina! Seriously, stop trying to make Gina Carano into Meryl Streep. She's gorgeous and charming and man, that girl hits hard! Let's see her doing more of that! I think this movie would have been better if you had explained Ava's backstory more and did less drama. I want to see Gina Carano kicking people's butts, not scenes of nefarious criminals searching houses. Should have made it a straight up kidnapping, explain a little more of her backstory and why she's so good at fighting, and then show her kicking butt!. Overall, I liked this movie, it was definitely worth the rental especially if you are a Carano fan or like to see a strong female action film. Hollywood needs more female action heroes. I look forward to when Hollywood catches up to Gina Carano and finds the perfect action heroine part for her because I find it a helluva lot more believable to see a woman like Gina Carano knock out 4 men in a room than I do Scarlett Johansen.",1396742400,36,1870,4.407514450867052

Things go awry, setting up the stage for Carano to show her fighting moves against some island tough guys while trying to find her husband.

The premise is not very complicated, and the style of the film is that of a minimalist procedural.  There is enough characterization for us to find Carano credible in her role and empathize with her.  Carano has a strong, charismatic screen presence that keeps our attention on her.  There is no excessive dialogue, but what there is works to advance the story and is mostly believable.  There are a few things that happen in the story that don't always seem consistent for the characters, but these are minor defects that we accept since we know that the point of them is to set things up to allow Carano to show off her martial arts skills on screen.

Overall this is a good film that I recommend to action film buffs.  Carano's performance as a tough-as-nails woman doing what needs to be done is the reason to see this movie.  I look forward to seeing more of her work.",1396742400,18,1494,4.492592592592593
