1496490,2,B00005JM4Q,"I was impressed with Jack Nicholson as I always am, and this film seemed to be going somewhere slightly original. Then the last 20 minutes happened and ruined the whole thing. It was as if they cut and pasted the endings to any teen-beat film (Never Been Kissed, anything with Freddie Prinze Jr., etc) and put them together to form this ending. It was so horrible and ruined everything. It definitely had a few funny parts, but most of which were seen in the previews. Nicholson had a fun role, Adam Sandler was his usual self, John Tutorro was excellent, and Heather Graham's role was only there so that the viewers could see her in her underwear. This is not something that is appropriate for even most 13 year olds. Not that it sould be rated R, but it was pushing it for a PG-13. The rating reflects profanity and constant crude/sexual humor including some homosexuality. Anger Management had a creative beginning, and then shattered the rest with its ridiculous ending.",1050105600,,974,4.701754385964913

I am the BIGGEST Sandler fan in all of fan history, and i strongly recommend this movie to anyone, Sandler/Nicholson fan or not.
I saw this movie 3 times. I think it's self-explanatory.

1496492,4,B00005JM4Q,".......That's the mantra Dr. Buddy Rydell (Jack Nicholson) teaches the patients in his anger management class to recite to calm themselves down. The joke is that Rydell himself is a seemingly disturbed semi-psychotic. After meeting on an ill-fated flight, helpless schlub Dave Buznik (Adam Sandler) is arrested and sentenced to attend Rydell's sessions, despite the fact that Rydell was the cause of the incident in the first place. After another ""Violent outburst"", Buznik is given an ultimatum: 24-Hour supervision by Rydell for one Month, or one Year in jail. After a few days, that Year in jail might just start to look good....
  Sandler delivers a relatively restrained performance, and Nicholson is more crazy than he's been since The Shining or Batman. He gets most of the laughs, while Sandler plays straight man. As usual, Sandler surrounds himself with some great talent, including Luis Guzman, Harry Dean Stanton, John Turturro, Marisa Tomei, John C. Reilly, and lots of others, including some truly inspired cameos that generate big laughs.
  While not gut-bustingly funny, Anger Management was a pretty good film, and the chemistry between Sandler and Nicholson is great; Nicholson can get a big laugh just by arching one of his trademark brows. I could have lived without the sappy finale, and Marisa Tomei's revalation at the end also dampened my enthusiasm a little; I know it's just a movie, but it defied all credibility. Otherwise, Anger Management is a fun way to spend a few hours.",1050105600,2,1503,5.097560975609756
1496493,4,B00005JM4Q,"Jack Nicholson seems to have a fetish for portraying dark, brooding and psychotic personalities in film. First, he was wreaking havoc as a wacko mental patient in ""One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest"". Next, he's posessed of a demonic spirit as a hotel resort guest in ""The Shining"". Now, he sort of reprises the first role in ""Anger Management"" - except, instead of being ""the hunted"", who once ran amok in an isolated mental ward, he is now ""the hunter"" - as a psychiatrist who hasn't quite cleared his head of those demented cobwebs, it seems. Enter a mild-mannered guy (Adam Sandler), who is extremely calm on the surface, but is somewhat a powder keg underneath. Thus, it takes a lot to get this Type A study in contrast to explode. This is where aversion type therapy kicks in, and the results could get quite messy, and hilarious in certain instances. While Nicholson's psychiatrist persona gets on Sandler's character's last nerve, it appears the former is teaching the latter everything he knows from his years of expertise at the same time - both from his view of life and from his profession. The storyline is good, containing a good dose of comedy with a touch of drama to spice it up. Add a fine main cast and a few celebrities to the mix, and you have the ultimate therapy session. Joining both Nicholson and Sandler in session, are John McEnroe, Bob Knight and other celebrities. Kevin Nealon, Woody Harrelson and Lynne Thigpen (in her final role), among others, round out the main cast. Need psychological help, but can't afford the high fees often associated with such therapy? ""Anger Management"" is the near-perfect antidote to help curb your aggressions. It's practically the best therapy to spend your precious bucks on...and it's cheap too!

1496494,3,B00005JM4Q,"Anger Management? Yea thats what your gonna need after seeing this movie. Its about 2 hours of pure Adam Sandler nice sugary goodness. Why does Sandler feel the need to show us he is a good boy in every movie? And Jack Nicholson...whhaat happened to this man?? He was once in great movies like The Shining and One Flew Over The Cuckoos Nest. Though I do admit he is the high point of this movie. He give an acting role similar to Cuckoos Nest but with such bad acting on Adam Sandler's part it is watered down. Adam plays a nice guy (yea he does this yet again) who ""harrasses"" a flight attendent and has to go through Anger Managment. He then goes on do commit such acts as to fight a blind man and break and womans nose and has to get full time anger management. Other things happen that usually happen in an Adam Sandler movie and the plot is quite predictable. I just want to know why Adam Sandler ever since The Wedding Singer has felt the urge to play roles where he is a good guy. What happened to the funny voices and great movies like Happy Gilmore and Billy Madison. The past three movies Sandler has put out: Little Nicky, Mr. Deeds, and Anger Management have all had Adam playing good Mr. Nice Guy roles. He realy needs to get out of this because not even Jack Nicholson can save him now.",1050019200,,1300,4.267206477732794

1496496,2,B00005JM4Q,"It just isn't Dave Buznik's day.  All he wants is headset so he can watch the movie playing on the airplane, but things quickly spirals out of control from there, and before he realizes what is happening, he is sitting in court while the judge sentences him to participate in twenty hours of anger management therapy.  The person in charge of the sessions is one Dr. Buddy Rydell, a renowned clinical psychologist with some unorthodox methods in treating his patients.  As Dr. Rydell invades in every aspects of Dave's private life, Dave must keep his temper or faces jail time if he fails the evaluation.
""There are two kinds of angry people, explosive and implosive.""
Apparently writer David Dorfman have no trouble making fun of and insulting anything and anyone he can get his hands on in Anger Management.  The jokes range from the tasteless to the somewhat amusing, but more often than not they are mean spirited rather than funny.  The endless barrage of penis cracks becomes so tiresome that I found myself grimacing instead of laughing at them.  Of course, who can forget the not so subtle references to Sandler's other movies.  The plot is mostly nonsensical and serves only to take the characters from one point to the next, with the hopes to squeeze out a few chuckles in the process.  The ending is mawkishly sentimental and will probably have you rolling your eyes at the corniness of the whole thing.
Adam Sandler plays the soft-spoken Dave Buznik, a guy who is intensely paranoid about showing affections in public.  His portrayal and delivery is practically a carbon copy of most of his prior roles, the differences between Dave and Sonny Koufax and Bobby Boucher are small if any at all.  Jack Nicholson, on the other hand, seems to have a lot of fun with Dr. Buddy Rydell, an eccentric man who lives by his own rules.  Nicholson by far is the most comical character of the bunch, and I would not mind seeing him paired up with Ben Stiller or Owen Wilson in the future.  This is not to say that Sandler and Nicholson did not emanate chemistry between the two of them, the most hilarious scene has got to be them singing a duet of ""I Feel Pretty"" from West Side Story.  Unfortunately, those moments are rare.  Marisa Tomei plays Sandler's love interest Linda.  The notable cameos this time around consist of Heather Graham, Woody Harrelson and John C. Reilly.
Anger Management plays like most of the previous Adam Sandler comedies, if you enjoy his routines, this will probably fit right in.  I, however, was not amused by the experience.  Laughs came only in fits and spurts for me, most of the time I sat wondering when the next punch line will be and how much longer the movie will drag on.  There is nothing special here.  At best you'll have a good time, at worst you'll feel like you just wasted two hours, my money is on the latter.",1049760000,20,2856,4.630952380952381

1496850,1,B00005JM4Q,"I did not laugh.  I didn't even smile.

This movie was slow and boring.

I don't like that song - - ""I Feel Pretty"" from ""West Side Story"" - - and they sing it about a dozen times throughout the movie.

I guessed the ending early on.

SPOILER ALERT......

The girlfriend, Linda (Marisa Tomei), set up everything from the very beginning.  Dave (Adam Sandler) had a lot of anger inside of him, but he kept it bottled up and let people walk all over him, which embarrassed Linda.  Linda couldn't stand it that Dave would never kiss her in public.  So, Linda met with the therapist and, together, they organized everything that Dave was about to go through, beginning with the plane ride.

The part with Kendra was so obvious, I cannot believe that anyone in the audience didn't see through that scene, as well as when Linda supposedly started dating the therapist.

At the end, Linda tells Dave that she set up everything.  Dave wasn't upset.  He actually laughed.  That was the only surprise for me throughout the entire movie.",1494115200,,1025,4.5911602209944755

Perhaps it has something to do with being able to relate to seemingly always being ""the bad guy,"" no matter how much abuse you endure.  Then seeing someone, in this case, Adam Sandler, egged on by Jack Nicholson, do the sorts of things you'd like to do yourself, like (SPOILER ALERT!) giving a Buddhist monk a wedgie, even after he allegedly repented for molesting your sister.  I was an only child, but I can still relate to feeling abused until you want revenge.

1497297,3,B00005JM4Q,"So yeah, I'm not going to beat around the bush with this one. Back in 2003, as far as films went, I was both an Adam Sandler and Jack Nicholson fan. Stuff like One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest, The Shining, Batman, Happy Gilmore, The Wedding Singer and Big Daddy, were just a handful of favorites.
When I heard that Adam Sandler and Jack Nicholson were being put in the same film which revolved ""anger management"" and the like, I was excited!

Well, after re-watching this very recently (since it had been available streamed through Netflix), I realized this film was NOT as great as I had remembered.
First I'll start by stating, the acting in this is NOT horrible! I felt everyone who was in this, even the small bit played by Woody Harrelson (who has gained a lot more recognition since this film), put great effort into their work. Which is kind of sad....

Initially, I have grown to understand what life is really about, and how people deal with situations differently in their lives, most notably anger. I myself have had my own share of anger issues with certain situations in my life, although it's never been a big problem to others around me, to a point where they decided to secretly force ""anger management"" on to me, and turn my life into a nightmare and screw with it to no dying end.

That is essentially what happens to Dave, played by Adam Sandler. He has from what I noticed, very minor issues and anger towards certain things in his life. Now honestly, to say that any average person DOES NOT have any issues or anger towards one thing or another in life, is just downright WRONG, which is why and where this film failed to be better than it was. His girlfriend Linda, played by Marisa Tomei, thinks he is an incredibly angry person, and decides to consult an ""anger management"" doctor to help Dave. Dr. Buddy Rydell, played by Jack Nicholson, is thus hired to help Dave with his anger issues, although this is NEVER revealed to Dave until the very end of the film.

After an incident while flying on an airplane, Dave and Buddy meet on the flight, and later are introduced to each other when Dave is sentenced to go through ""anger management"" by a judge, for disrupting the flight, when he initially DID NOTHING at all, other than get annoyed that the flight attendants were ignoring his requests for service (he wanted a headset to join Buddy in watching a film on the plane) and angered by the flight attendants, Dr. Buddy Rydell who sat next to him, and the flight marshall who decided to harass Dave for ""having a bad day"", resulting in Dave being tasered by the marshall.

He goes to the ""anger management"" meeting, only to realize Dr. Buddy Rydell is the anger management doctor. The film proceeds to constantly drive Daves anger levels, by either ""planted"" characters and people that he keeps encountering, to being under pressure with work and friends. His anger is ""prodded"" and ""provoked"" to a point where he DOES assault an elderly blind man in a bar with his own walker, prompting the judge from before to sentence Dave to a higher level of ""anger management"", which involves Dr. Buddy Rydell to move in with Dave to constantly supervise him 24/7.

And really, that's all that goes on in the film. Dave is constantly, purposely made angry and angrier as the film continues on, which is just cruel and unfair, because he never had the level of anger and issues going on before the events of the film took off, to the point later in the film where he assaults Dr. Buddy Rydell outright.
He is ""forced"" to endure an ""anger management"" program, where he never had the anger problems before doing so, and if anything, the film does nothing but give the message that everyone in the world should be forced to be ""happy"" and cheery non-stop.

This would be reasonable or acceptable, if it weren't for the fact that, it's not up to anyone around one person to make or ""force"" that one person to be happy. That is on the terms of that one person alone, and back to what I said earlier in this review, people have anger and issues with certain things in their lives. Nobody's life is perfect and grief-free, and people have to deal with their issues in their own ways. Sure, I can see how anger management could potentially help people feel better about certain situations, or about how they deal with their issues, but in the end, the main thing to remember is that forcing happiness, or to always remain calm or content with what's going on around you, is NOT anger management.

Anyway, that's not to say the rest of the film is not good. Besides the main flaw that forcing someone to undergo anger management therapy, and repeatedly provoking him until he's about to have a nervous-breakdown, this film does have it's funny moments and some laughs.
Adam Sandler and Jack Nicholson made a funny team of characters, and their unfortunate, albeit forced time together in the film was very entertaining to watch.

But if you also can't get passed the nature of this film, and what kind of message it's telling to any viewer, then you will realize this is nothing more than a cruel and unfair film to those who truly go through anger issues in life.",1429142400,,5169,4.567421790722761

All the while, the love interest of the film, played by Marisa Tomei, stands on the sidelines, questioning the nature of her relationship with Sandler.

Anger Management

Release Date: April 11, 2003
Notable Actors: Adam Sandler, Jack Nicholson, Marisa Tomei
Director: Peter Segal

After a misunderstanding on a plane Dave Buznik (Adam Sandler) is ordered by the court to attend anger management classes taught by Dr. Buddy Rydell (Jack Nicholson). Dave tries to get out of the class until an incident at a bar, which involved a broken nose of a waitress, put him in Dr. Rydells intensive anger management program. Dr. Rydell has a more unorthodox way of doing things, and it is throwing Daves life into chaos. However, maybe Dr. Rydell is the only one that can save Dave from a problem that everyone else sees except of Dave.

It seems like Dave just cant get a break. He has a gorgeous girlfriend who he is on the verge of losing. Daves boss takes credit for all of his work and ideas he comes up with. Now after a misunderstanding on a flight, he is put in the hands of Dr. Rydell (who by the way is crazy!). Overall I thought this movie was more of a funny/serious one. There were parts that you got a snicker out of and other parts where you actually felt bad for Dave, because he hasn't really done anything. One scene that comes to mind is the beginning plane scene. Dave just ask the flight attendant a question and next thing you know Dave is accused of assault and management problems from something he did not do.

Adam Sandler v. Jack Nicholson. These actors were going back and forth with each other the entire movie, which made it funny. Both actors have proven themselves in previous movies and it showed in this particular one. However, it seems as if Adam Sandler plays the same role or the same type of person in his movies. If you seen one Adam Sandler movie you pretty much have seen them all. Jack Nicholson on the other hand brings something different in his characters that he plays. With that being said I believe Anger Management was not a Jack Nicholson movie. I felt the role he was playing would have been better suited for someone else. I am not trying to take anything away from his acting, because he is a great actor.

If you are looking for a movie you haven't seen yet, I would recommend this movie. This movie is also currently on Netflix.

1497888,1,B00005JM4Q,I watched this grudgingly - I can't even remember why now.  Maybe because it was free at the time and I wanted to prove to myself that this couldn't be EXactly what I expected.  It was.  Just so annoying.  Guy who is not really that angry faces the constant frustration of being handled and forced to go into anger management.  It just made me need anger management.,1392595200,,366,4.402985074626866
1497889,5,B00005JM4Q,"I have purchased this DVD twice because I enjoyed it so much that I have given the first copy away to to a friend in need of Anger Management.

Although the story has a lot of humor there are many serious truths to the story of managing one's anger.

Adam Sandler plays his role so well as the inhibited geek unwilling to express his true feelings for his fiance played by Marisa Tomei. Whilst Jack Nicholson plays the role of the supposedly shifty anger management consultant.

The stars in this movie were excellently supported by by several other stars who assumed lesser roles but who all played their parts most convincingly.

You really should watch this movie for both laughs and for serious contemplation of what might happen to us when we fail to allow ourselves to be ourselves.

1497983,4,B00005JM4Q,"The ""Anger Management"" blu-ray has an outstanding, BEAUTIFUL HD picture, with very accurate colors (as with the flesh tones, for example), vivid colors, and it's very sharp.  Too bad it's in 2.35:1 aspect ratio, who can enjoy that?  What, this movie about PEOPLE, which emphasizes dialog, needed an ultra-wide screen--thus way too narrow-- for freaking panoramic views?  Of what?  I never understand directors.

The audio is loud and very clear. This blu-ray is clearly better visually, esp., than the DVD version, a DVD which itself nonetheless looks very good on an HD TV.  I'm very pleased with this blu-ray purchase.

The story is pretty funny, the lines and delivery are hilarious, and it's Nicholson at his usual funny best, and Sandler (someone I can't stand generally), here subdued throughout, demonstrating a very different form of humor for him-- which he does well in this film.  I can watch this movie yet again, which I'd never say about any other Sandler film.

The script, story, and acting are first rate, with John Turturo particularly good in a minor role, too, and several well-known actors sprinkled throughout, plus some well-known NY Yankees players and Mayor Giuliani.

Although I am not a fan of Adam Sandler, I do find this comedy amusing and filled with wit and humour.

The story revolves around a designer of cat's clothes, who is much underappreciated for his efforts by the management, being set-up by his girlfriend for anger management treatment under Buddy Rydell, played by Jack Nicholson (whose effort contributes to a relatively fine performance), who progressively assists Sandler to distinguish between blind rage and what constitutes justifiable anger, thereby, allowing him to free himself from his push-over mentality and fighting for his rights in his career.

The subplot revolves around his relationship with his girlfriend for whom he's too shy to express displays of affection in public, given the fact that when he did so as a child, he was subjected to deep humiliation when his nemesis pulled down his pants.

Buddy Rydell conniving comes out with a plan that spurs him to ask for his girlfriend's hand during a baseball match, thereby, freeing him of his fear of public displays of affection.

1498084,1,B00005JM4Q,"I remember when this was released.  It was around the time that Nicholson was still considered an acting god and Sandler was still considered funny.  Things have changed and both of their careers are less than admirable at this point (Nicholson is still a god, but one that coasts on a clich&eacute;, but Sandler is a mess) and this particular film rests as the beginning of the end for both of them.  I mean, this came one year after Nicholson's last great role (`About Schmidt') and right before Sandler had a string of ridiculous lows.

`Anger Management' could have been funny, and I'm sure that on paper it looked like it would be a giant success, but the film fails to ever live up to any potential.  Jack Nicholson and Adam Sandler yelling at one another for two hours just isn't as funny as you'd think it would be, and the endless barrage of failed jokes make this a burden to watch.  It grows tiresome and winds up draining the spirit out of the audience.  The cameos fail to make any impact (save for Reilly and Graham, to a degree).  At the end of the day this is just another one of Sandler's ill-advised film choices.

The worst thing about `Anger Management' is that it is trying to have a good time but in the process it just gets everything wrong.  That seems to be Sandler's issue.  He has too much fun ruining everyone else's good time.  His humor has faded and he no longer understands how to carry a film, and Nicholson is just content in his old age to play a caricature of his own perceived persona.  There is nothing new anymore, and this is quite frankly the worst portrayal of Jack Nicholson that Nicholson has given us to date.",1357084800,2,1654,4.437086092715232

Nicholson has become a great comedic actor over the last 10-15 years, so I took a chance, and I'm very happy that I did. Sandler's portrayal of the pathetic loser was outstanding. From being bullied as a child, to becoming the whipping boy for his boss, he just is quiet and nice to everyone that treats him badly. Enter Jack Nicholson as an ""Anger Management"" guru. In most cases Sandler is playing the straight man to Nicholson, as Jack torments him to the point of explosion, which is where the adventure really starts. Sandler is led to confront the people who have wronged him in the past, with amazing results. The supporting cast is excellent, and you never know what's coming next.

Movies can be reviewed in many ways.  ""What was this film compared to what I expected?""  ""What was this film compared to what I enjoy?""  ""What was this film compared to what I think the producers / director intended?""  Always keep that in mind when reading reviews.  As I began watching this movie, I wasn't enjoying it, because a) it wasn't what I expected and b) it didn't seem like the sort of thing I usually enjoy.  But when I began to understand what this movie was really all about, I loved it.

Anger Management is nothing less than a very enjoyable, funny insight into the nature of all anger.  Psychologists and spiritual types alike will tell you that all anger we feel toward others is ultimately anger we feel toward ourselves.  That can often be hard to swallow when we're feeling hacked off at someone for something they did to us.  But what this film shows us, gradually, and in a very sneaky way, is that most of us are a lot angrier inside than we care to admit, and that, in truth, the person we're most angry with is ourselves. And only when we deal with that can our lives get better and happier.

Sandler plays a typical hard working Joe (Dave Buznik) who's having a very hard time getting ahead in the world.  No matter how hard he tries to please his boss, nothing is ever enough, and he's consistently passed over for opportunities to advance.  And he's beginning to have doubts about his girlfriend, played by Marisa Tomei, as her best friend just happens to be a guy with the largest equipment Dave has ever seen.  Despite set back after set back, kind hearted Dave persists, swallowing his pride, putting up with his boss and his love frustrations, hoping some day things will turn around for him.

Then, one day, quite calmly, he asks for a set of movie headsets on a long flight and ends up being arrested for assault and battery.  He's done nothing more than touch the flight attendant on the arm and calmly repeat his request for a headset, and still, he ends up in court.  Assuming that things will be quickly cleared up as he has actually done nothing wrong, Dave is shocked when the situation blows up in his face.  In a heartbeat, Dave's simple, if depressing life, has been turned completely upside down, and he's facing a choice between a prison term or living each day with one of the most annoying therapists ever to walk the face of the earth.

After just a few days of living with Jack Nicholson's character, Dr. Buddy Rydell, Dave is beginning to wonder if prison might not have been the better choice.  Try as he might to comply with the extreme and completely unconventional demands of his therapy (such as stopping a car in the middle of a bridge in rush hour traffic to sing ""I Feel Pretty""), it seems more to Dave that his therapy is specifically designed to make him crazy and ruin his life than to help with some imaginary anger problem he never had in the first place.

The movie climbs through a series of increasingly proposterous situations as Dr. Rydell seems bent on stealing Dave's girl and leaving him jobless and penniless.  On the verge of losing everything, Dave finally snaps and really does become angry ... and with good reason.  Rydell HAS been trying to ruin his life and steal his girl ... to help Dave admit to being angry, perhaps for the first time in his life.  Dave is the kind of guy who has sucked up other people's abuse all his life, never allowing himself to get angry, even when he had reason to.  Dave HAS an anger management problem ... he doesn't allow himself to get angry or to admit what he's angry about.  We think of anger management as a class for people who can't control their anger, and who unleash it too often in inappropriate situations.  This movie ... surprise ... is about someone whose problem is quite the opposite.  Only when Dave finally gets angry at how completely out of control his life is getting, does he discover his REAL problem ... he's been letting people walk on him all his life.  And the person he most needed to get angry with was himself ... for letting his life become such a mess while trying to live up to the expectations of everyone around him while forgetting about himself.

In the end, it turns out that everything that's happened since Dave sat down on the airplane has been a set up.  His loving girl, Linda (Marisa Tomei), set the whole thing up with Dr. Rydell to help push Dave ""gently"" over the edge and help him finally get angry enough at himself to stop letting other people push him around.

As someone who suffered from this same problem for most of my life, when the point of this movie got to me, I was utterly blown away.  I never saw it coming.  When I was younger, I used to let people walk all over me, making my own life a living hell by allowing others to make of my life what they wanted, then blaming them for what my life had become.  NO one can make anything out of your life other than what you want, unless you let them. And if we choose to let other people push us around, we are allowing them to have our way with us ... and that choice ... our choice ... is what makes our life a mess.  Only when we recirect our hidden anger away from other people and get fed up ourselves with our own willingness to be walked on can we finally start enjoying the kind of life we always wanted all along.

If you don't get the deeper meaning of this movie, it can seem to be a very silly, stupid flick, with one apparently crazy scene after another stacking up to a huge pile of silliness.  But it all has a point ... just how completely stupid will some of us let our lives become before we finally scream ENOUGH!!! and stand up for ourselves and begin making out lives what we want them to be.

Like many of the movies with which Sandler has been involved for the past several years, Anger Management is a sleeper.  I was never a fan of Sandler in his younger days, but I have a ton of respect for him now.  His recent work consistently serves up deep insights into the nature of the human heart, cloaked in what appears to be mindless silliness that is anything but.  Sandler's genius is helping us learn about ourselves while keeping us laughing.  It's brilliant, and I thank him for it.",1249862400,,6246,4.3939130434782605
1498341,3,B00005JM4Q,"Anger Management: 6/10: Having a bad ending has torpedoed more than one film experience. The Village's twist was a groaner and the last scene of The Last Samurai knocked it down a rung or two. in a comedy however the end shouldn't matter.

Comedy is about laughter during the journey not the stories conclusion. None of our best comedies are known for their finales. Meet the Parents left with a comparative whimper, There's Something about Mary's ending is at best forgettable, and the bombastic over the top noise of say The Blues Brothers or Caddyshack certainly wasn't for everyone. (The exception to this rule is the wonderful Stay Puff Marshmallow Man from Ghostbusters)

Unlike thrillers or drama, comedy rarely invests enough in the plot to begin with for the ending to matter all that much. In addition, an Adam Sandler comedy, let us face it, has less plot than most. Alternatively, at the very least, it has the same plot and characters over and over again. Sandler after all is the Jim Varney of Long Island nerds. Therefore, to create a disaster this momentous you first need an hour and change of good comedy (rare enough esp. with Mr. Sandler on board) then you will need an ending so stupendously bad it erases the laughter.

First the good news. This movie has some quite funny bits. The bad news? Well let's start with the last 15 minutes or so absolutely feel good romantic awfulness with enough celebrity cameos that could sink the Titanic, wipe out any goodwill one feels towards former Mayor Giulliani of New York and embarrass one to be a Yankee fan. Add on a plot device at the end that would not be out of place in a Deanna Durbin film and let the jaw dropping awfulness commence.

The last 15 minutes aside, this movie has some funny bits. Even stupid stuff like sweaters for overweight cats worked for me. Now that is rare. The set-up is pure gold and the cast is great.

If anything, Sandler is easily the weakest of the bunch. (Luis Guzman and John Turturro's characters needed their own movie and it was great seeing Jack be Jack again after that slog that was About Schmidt. Sandler knows how to do cruel. Anger Management was such a good concept and had such funny execution that it demanded a dark cruel outburst of energy at the end not indescribably painful schmaltz.",1248825600,,2302,4.646191646191646

Sandler plays Dave Buznik who gets on a plane, and has to sit next to Dr. Buddy Rydell. Buddy happens to be an Anger Management Therapist. When Dave is wrongfully accused of being assaulting a flight attendent on the plane, he has to see Buddy for help. Buddy moves into Dave's apartment, forces him to confront his childhood bully, makes him ask out smokin' hot Heather Graham, even though Dave already has a girlfriend, makes him break up with his girlfriend so he can date her, and much more!

1498431,4,B00005JM4Q,"This is one of those times when the ending absolutely makes the movie. For much of the movie, I was holding myself back a bit. The situations were funny, but they were extreme, and while I don't mind unbelievable situations in movies, I enjoy them more from a distance. When I got to the end, though, it all made sense, and the movie went from a 3-star, average comedy to a 4-star comedy/drama.

Dave (Adam Sandler) is on a plane and people start completely overreacting to his simplest request, accusing him of being belligerent. It escalates, and he finds himself arrested and sentenced to anger therapy with Dr. Buddy Rydell (Jack Nicholson). Again, things escalate, and Buddy ends up moving in with Dave and shadowing him everywhere, even moving in on Dave's girlfriend (Marisa Tomei).

I started out the movie being angry on Dave's behalf, then gradually became irritated with him for allowing all these things to continue happening to him--in retrospect, it was a very effective bit of filmmaking, because that's exactly what I believe the audience was intended to feel.

Adam Sandler was believable as the mild-mannered, put-upon young businessman. Jack Nicholson, however, seemed way over the top, until, as I said, the end, at which point he seemed perfect.

Much fun, and better than I expected. It was a good way to spend a family evening, and even engendered serious conversations about the management of anger.",1227398400,,1423,4.941422594142259
1498432,4,B00005JM4Q,"Unquestionably this movie was never going for plausibility.  A relatively mild-mannered man, Dave Buznik finds himself in the charge of Buddy, a slightly potty anger management therapist, after an altercation on a plane finds Dave in court. Of course, the fact he's mild-mannered is half the joke...  I never really found Adam Sandler funny. He's far better as a straight actor with a light-hearted approach. This movie confirms this, as Jack Nicholson, as Buddy, is a class above him at all times. Jack is simply funnier, and Hollywood royalty.  As for 'laugh-factor', yes there are definitely some funny moments, especially if you leave your brain at the door, but it's not what it perhaps could have been. I feel more could have been made of the rest of the cast, such as Torturro, Guizman, Harrellson (small part).  But overall it's reasonable.  Best moment is a cameo by a certain sports star...",1223510400,,900,4.933774834437086
1498433,5,B00005JM4Q,"I'd be tempted to slam ""Anger Management"" as another slice of lighthearted, sanitized mental-illness swill from Hollywood (it does play out like ""28 Days"" meets ""The Dream Team""), if it wasn't for Jack Nicholson's manic performance--he hasn't been this funny since ""The Shining."" Adam Sandler does well, and exhibits some control as a guy with problems containing his rage (I'll admit...I've never seen any of his other movies). But poor Marisa Tomei...the girl who once won an Oscar has become one-dimensional background scenery, indistinguishable from any would-be starlet. The movie's lowbrow humor and endless parade of cameos gets tedious near the end, and from the overhead shot of a packed baseball stadium that kicks off the last act, anyone who's even half-awake will be able to predict the unforgivably sappy conclusion. Average entertainment redeemed somewhat by Nicholson's inherent zaniness.",1220400000,,904,5.510791366906475

1498436,4,B00005JM4Q,I have to say Anger Management was the best Adam Sandler film I'd seen since Big Daddy back in 2003. Sandler and Jack Nicholson have great chemistry in this funny comedy. The trailer pretty much gives you the plot but unlike some comedys the trailer doesn't spoil all the jokes. The cameos and in jokes put tears in my eyes in this film. The film is taking a beating from some folks and from critics but just go and see this film with a open mind and enjoy it.,1206403200,,460,4.179775280898877
1498437,4,B00005JM4Q,"Adam Sandler is one of those actors who hits and misses with the best of them. Perhaps one of the more successful alumni from SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE when it comes to the crossover to film, he started big and has since dropped down a bit. This could be explained by the fact that he chose to almost make the same movie over and over again and then tried to do something completely different. I mean BILLY MADISON, HAPPY GILMORE and THE WATERBOY were basically all about a bumbling idiot who ended up doing well. And folks enjoyed those movies.

Although you can't make the same movie forever and expect it to do well, shifting gears to portray a son of the Devil didn't seem to be a good career move. And MR.DEEDS didn't do so hot either as he chose to make the bumbling idiot a sap instead. So it's great to see that he's chosen to take his abilities in a different direction and do it right with this film.

ANGER MANAGEMENT features Sandler as Dave Buznik, a backwards, overworked and underappreciated exec who does the work while his boss garners the rewards. On a plane trip to join him to present a new idea, Dave is charged with assault on a stewardess simply because he asks for a set of headphones all the while being ignored. The judge sentences Dave to anger management therapy. His therapist?  Dr. Buddy Rydell (Jack Nicholson), the passenger who sat next to him on the plane egging him on.

In group therapy, Dave continues his backward ways. When he gets slightly miffed about the way Buddy is handling things, Buddy tells him that he's going to require more intensive therapy.

Moving in with Dave, Buddy takes over his life. He goes with him to work, hits on his girlfriend, spouts off to his boss and goes so far as to sleep in the same bed with him since the apartment is so small. He goes as far as to make Dave confront his old grade school nemesis, now a peace loving Buddhist monk!

Through it all we are allowed to see Dave as he changes. Buddy's techniques may be a bit odd and at one point we all might hate him as he seems about to do something dreadful (hey I don't want to spoil everything), but the results and the changes that Dave goes through are there for us to see. And the twist at the end comes out of nowhere, making sense and giving the whole movie an even better feel.

Had this movie been made with just anyone, it might not have turned out near as well. But Sandler and Nicholson both turn in tremendous performances. Sandler's bumbler has become a character with abilities that he just hasn't tapped into yet. And Nicholson's Dr. Buddy is one of his most eccentric and yet endearing as well.

The laughs here are natural and ones that will not only tickle but make you guffaw at times as well. If you need something that lifts your spirits and makes you smile then you might want to rent this one tonight.",1205366400,,2843,4.381404174573055

1498439,3,B00005JM4Q,"After reading a tirade of silly,angry and vicious comments on one of my Amazon Friend's review of THE GOLDEN COMPASS,I found the Adam Sandler/Jack Nicholson ANGER MANAGEMENT right up my alley for one reason alone: to view the different ways that people express anger. Some people blurt out instantly and destroy everything and everyone around them, while others hold it in until they ""shoot everyone"" as Nicholson,the therapist explains to his reluctant patient Dave (Sandler).Interesting, that both ways to manage anger end with the same result!!!!! Ignoring an irritating fly is one of the toughest things we humans will ever do!!!!That is just what my Amazon Friend did...he ignored the comments.....SMART FRIEND!
This film really loses a lot of steam after the first 60 minutes, and jokes that were funny fall flat and tiresome as the film limps along senselessly for the next 40 minutes. This is not to say that this film is without merit. There is one very funny scene on the Queensboro Bridge where Nicholson stops Sandler from driving in order to teach him the song ""I Feel Pretty"" from WEST SIDE STORY.All-in-all, though, the film remains a ""one trick pony"",albeit one that does contain a valuable lesson for anyone who has ever felt anger at least once in their life!

Of course I didn't expect a serious approach when a movie is starred by Adam Sandler, and judging by the DVD cover, I could only expect to have some good laughs. Honestly, I laughed a lot.

It jokes with situations that might be familiar to some of us and in the end teaches us that nothing is so bad that can't be overcomed.

1498572,1,B00005JM4Q,"It's axiomatic in theatre and film that when a secondary character starts to emerge and overshadow the leads, the project is in trouble.  In Anger Management we see this problem elevated to unprecedented extremes.  It's true that secondary characters like Chuck, John Turturro, and Lou, Luis Guzman deliver some of the best acting and most cheerful moments in the picture, eclipsing the rampant stupidity of Sandler and Nicholson.  But this film actually carries the phenomenon one step beyond.

From start to finish, non-actors known for their names, and tempers, walk through this film with all the conviction of octogenarians being wheeled through a nursing home.  They are not even given anything to do, they are used symbolically.  The apotheosis of this is John McEnroe.  McEnroe drew attention to himself a while back through behavior so abominable it dragged the sport of tennis down to hitherto unplumbed depths.  A despicable brat, he was only allowed to stick around because he filled seats.  In Anger Management he doesn't even have a line, he's a knowing wink at the audience.

The same can be said of Bobby Knight and Roger Clemens.  Rudolph Giuliani makes an appearance.  Woody Harrelson is funny as Galaxia not because he's funny as Galaxia, but because the casting itself is amusing.  The highlight of the film occurs when Nicholson appears to be giving himself a Frankenstein treatment with a device emitting jolts of blue electricity intended to stimulate his scalp.  Nicholson is comfortable as a demented, irascible coot - what a stretch for him!  Sandler is, as always, a lost man/child with a head and face less interesting than a boiled egg.  Marisa Tomei, a good actress, appears to be somewhat anesthetized as she smiles through the insipid love story allegedly driving this catastrophe.

That Sandler continues to find employment renews my faith in America, a land that welcomes the tired, the stupid, the talentless, those who unapologetically aim low, with open arms.  If your movie can be stolen out from under you by a washed up tennis bad boy without lines, you're not just bad, you're awful.",1177891200,6,2124,5.037249283667622

I've seen Adam Sandler in numerous movies (and hated most of them), but as humble, wishy-washy Dave Buznik, Sandler is at his low-key best.  Buznik is the last person to have an anger management problem, but following a fateful series of miscues (and hysterically funny miscues at that) he is ordered by a judge to attend an anger management course.  And this is not just any old course:  This is a course led by the unorthodox and dysfunctional Dr. Buddy Rydell (Jack Nicholson's inherent creepiness is perfect for this role).  Nicholson and Sandler play off one another in grand fashion; the goofy therapist pushing the mild-mannered Buznik to the edge--and beyond--is mucho fun to watch!

An added delight to this campy comedy is the plethora of camoes, including John C. Reilly, Woody Harrelson (also hysterically funny), Rudy Giuliani, and New York Yankee greats (and ex-greats) Derek Jeter and Roger Clemens.  ANGER MANAGEMENT is pure fun, complete with milquetoast ending and wacky Nicholson facial expressions.  Enjoy!

So you have a buildup of tension throughout the movie followed by a weak and rushed attempt at a payoff. The movie should have been dumped in the first draft stage.

Anger Management is one of the best Adam Sandler comedies I've seen, and the fact that Jack Nicholson is in it as the second main character makes it all the better. Their personalities go great together and really fit the story. And believe it or not, there's not just great acting, but a great script too. Hilarious scenes and jokes are overflowing throughout the movie with charm and classic fun. While it does have a romance back-plot, don't worry about it teetering between genres -- this one is a knee-slapping comedy all the way. And with some great supporting actors and actresses such as John Turturro, Luis Guzman, Marisa Tomei, Allen Covert, and Woody Harrelson, it's the perfect blend of talent and comfortable atmosphere to make Anger Management a keeper.

Not only is the film itself a great buy, but the DVD is packed with all sorts of goodies including feature-length commentary by Sandler and director Peter Segal, deleted scenes, ""My Buddy, Jack"" featurette, an anger survey game to see whether or not you have problems of your own, a making-of featurette, and a hilarious blooper real. Couple that with crystal-clear audio and picture and you've got an amazing deal.

As for this particular viewer, not very many comedies I see in theatres or through rentals make me think ""Hey, this is something I need to own"", but Anger Management is one of them. With Jack's funniest, whackiest side shining through and the obvious comical chemistry between the cast, it's no wonder why this won over my heart. I suggest any Nicholson and/or Sandler fan pick this up for plenty of laughs, memorable scenes, and unforgettable lines!",1145404800,,1919,4.898461538461539

I'm sure that in the writing process the gags sprang from the plot, but the plot is definately not the strength of this movie.

Adam plays Dave Busnick whose anger 'flared up' on a work flight and therefore one thing leads to another and he finds himself in court twice and his punishment is to be placed in anger management class or face jail time.

Again, it's a funny movie, but there are a fair few corny parts that mar it a little.

Woody Harelson makes a hillarious cameo role as a cross dresser and he steals that entire scene and John McEnroe makes a cameo appearance too.  I'm rating it 4 stars for the humour and the fifth star is lost due to Jack Nicholson (painful).",1143849600,,753,4.45985401459854

The first 2/3 of the movie is fine with some funny scenes and a decent plot.
Then the screenwriters go for every corny cliche they can find to end the movie with. Maybe they had real writers do the first 80 minutes or so then they give it to a 5th grader to finish it.

1498771,5,B00005JM4Q,"I had read a lot of mixed reactions to ""Anger Management"", but nothing could stop me from watching a movie with Adam Sandler and my favorite actor ever, Jack Nicholson. Forget the plot and things like that. The mere idea of pairing these two is reason enough to see this movie.

David Buznik (Sandler) is a mild - mannered businessman who has to deal with a less than admirable job and overcome his anxiousnous about proposing to his girlfriend (Marisa Tomei). While on a flight to St. Louis, David gets into an altercation with a flight attendant, though in reality he didn't really do anything wrong. The courts sentence him to Anger Management Class. There he meets Dr. Buddy Rydell (Nicholson), a doctor who may either be a medical genius...or insane. After a failed stinit with an anger buddy (John Turtorro), Rydell decides the best way to cure David's anger is to move in with him for 30 days. And that's where the fun begins. Rydell takes David through a series of tasks to cure his anger, including a confrontation with his boss, a failed ""date"" with a weight conscious girl (Heather Graham), and most hilariously an ex - childhood bully who is now a monk (John C. Reilly). Throughout the film, we get to see each of these characters as themselves. Buddy, however, is rathrer mysterious. He leaves you through the whole film guessing if he's a good guy or a bad guy. The ending wraps things up nicely and hilariously.

This film is a hilarious romp from start to finish. The two stars are both great, but of course only one really shines. Sandler may get top billing, but Jack takes this movie and runs with it. He pretty much gets all the best lines and owns the movie. Then again, it's not like it's unexpected - this is Jack Nicholson we're talking about.

This film is also notable for the many cameos in this movie. Woody Harrelson, John Turtorro, Heather Graham, Bobby Knight, Louis Guzman, John C. Reilly John McEnroe, Marc Maguire, Derek Jeter and Rudy Guiliani all pop up at one point, and make the most of their screen time.

It's a funny movie worth rewatching. Well, here's the plot. After a man played by Sandler has a hilarious airplane problem, he's matched up with an anger management counselor played by Jack Nicholson. This counselor happens also to be crazy.
Well, this movie from start to end is hilarious. John Turturro as usual is a blast. There are loads of hilarious moments from ""I feel pretty"", the fight with the blind guy, the fight with the monk, and mucccccccccccccccccccccch more. I recommend this funny comedy to any Sandler or Nicholson fan who give great performances or anyone who wants to get lots of good laughs. A good comedy to have in any collection. Plus, there are good special features including trailers and 4 absolutely hilarious deleted scenes. (They should have been kept in the movie, believe me) So, even if you saw it at the theather, you should rent it or buy it just to watch those hilarious deleted scenes.

1498774,3,B00005JM4Q,"ANGER MANAGEMENT isn't quite the gem it probably could have been.  The combination of droll-faced and laconic Adam Sandler with the devilish and ferocious Jack Nicholson could have been a match made in heaven, but somewhere along the line, it just doesn't gel.  Sandler plays a young businessman who was mocked and scorned as a child and who finds himself in court after supposedly assaulting an airline flight attendant.  Nicholson plays the celebrated anger management counselor who is supposed to set Sandler on the right path.

Perhaps because the plot of the movie is really just one big set-up, it may be that an audience finds it hard to swallow all that Sandler has to go through for incidents that were truly not his fault.  By its over the top ending, though, we find out why Sandler was subjected to this anger management therapy, and the happy ending seems to set things right?  Marisa Tomei seems a little too old for Sandler and spends most of her time looking doe-eyed; John Turturro has a nice role as a very angry patient who is partnered with Sandler; and we have cameos from Heather Graham and Woody Harrelson that aren't particularly noteworthy, although watching Graham talk with a mouth full of cupcake is a bit inspired.

Beyond that, this is absurd, but with some bits here and there some people may find amusing.

Jack Nicholson is always wonderful as a crazy person but frankly, I don't see much appeal in the deadpan characters

played by Adam Sandler- this one included.  I'm not sure how he manages to portray the angry parts while still conveying his usual expressionlessness.  The support group has some expected stereotypes that some people find amusing- lesbian lovers, a man prone to violence, a repressed gay man- and the characters provide some unsuprising gags. Marisa Tomei is lovely as Sandler's girlfriend, not a role with a lot of humor, although she seems sweet.  Dave gets to work with a fat cat with the same personality that Sandler  himself appears to have, so fans of stoic fat cats will enjoy the cat dressing scenes, sparse though they are.

Most of the movie was highly improbable- Buddy vandalises a car and alienates Dave's co-workers, abuses him in his own home by moving in for 30 days- yet we're expected to swallow this as plausible.  There is some sort of trickery involving Buddy and Dave's girlfriend- oddly enough she supports the trickery.  When the full plot line is ""dramatically"" revealed to us, we learn she had a bigger role in this than was originally assumed, yet oddly, Dave still trusts her and wants to marry her.

Truth is that the first hour and ten minutes is some of the best pairing ever in a comedy movie, Nicholson is very much as good as he has ever been playing the character of anger manager and potential Adam Sandler savoir, who has injected himself thoroughly into the young man's life, on a court order to manage Sandler's seemingly accidental violent sprees on Aeroplanes and coffee shops, Nicholson has the full blown mania, spars with Sadler very well, with some extremely memorable scenes, almost four star / five star entertainment, until the final thirty minutes that does the smooch, smaltz, literally stop the baseball show with the I love you ending on  the big stadium screen we have seen a million times before, and then another extra smaltz ending one on top of that for good measure, means that this has to be one of the cheesiest movies of all time where the ending(s) actually ruin a great hour of a completely different film.

David Buznik (Adam Sandler) plays the role of a mild mannered executive assistant.  At the onset of the movie David is being provoked and embarrassed during his childhood but he never shows any anger.

  David has carried childhood experiences into adulthood and his romantic relationship with Linda (Marisa Tomei) is fragile to say the least.  David has a sexual phobia and is embarrassed to even give Linda a kiss in public.  An altercation with the Flight Attendant and Security Guard on a business flight gets David in court and the Judge orders him to complete an Anger Management course.

  Dr. Buddy Rydell (Jack Nicholson) is the Anger Management counselor assigned by the court.  Dr. Rydells' therapy and manipulation of David lead to one hilarious scene after another.  Dr. Rydell moves into Davids apartment to give him direct nonstop therapy.  The comedy is nonstop as well from this point on as Buddy works his therapy on David.  The funniest scene has to be where David and Chuck get into a bar brawl and David ends back in court.  The Judge comes off with the line ""Flight attendants weren't enough so you've moved onto waitresses"".  David explains how he accidentally broke the waitresses nose with the blind mans cane.

  Dr. Rydells' motives seem to come to life as he persuades Lisa to leave David for a trial separation.  David falls for the separation as being part of his `therapy'.  You'll feel like David is getting suckered one more time by Dr. Rydell but you better watch the movie and see.

 On a 5 star basis I'd give this movie a 3 star rating.  It's hilarious and even ends up with a little romance.",1106611200,,1747,4.7275747508305646

The point is for people to laugh and enjoy watching it.  Sandler plays a character for whom Murphy's Law seems to have been written.  He's not very assertive, and this adds to his problems.  Nicholson plays a very over the top anger management therapist.  Many of the funny moments in the movie come as a direct result of this such as the one where he pulls a gun on a group of Buddhist monks only for it to be a watergun.  There are many laughs throughout the movie so settle into your easy chair and enjoy.

The special features are better than what I've seen on some of the older Sandler movies.  The two featurettes are both entertaining, and the deleted scenes are pretty close to production quality - no poor sound or picture as in the special editions of Happy Gilmore and Billy Madison.  The blooper reel is pretty funny, and it is capped off with a number of failed takes on Heather Graham's cupcake scene.  The extras make this an overall solid DVD.",1105056000,,1126,4.443902439024391
1498928,3,B00005JM4Q,"Dave Buznik (Adam Sandler) has a problem, and he's had it for years.  Not a guy who loses his temper, Dave nevertheless is a walking time-bomb of repressed rage.  Whether a childhood target for bullies or simply one of those men who joins the long-gray line of beaten-down adulthood, Dave is essentially an android who never says or otherwise expresses what's on his mind.  As an adult, he works for a company that sells expensive pet supplies for the moneyed pet owners (his big idea involves weight-concealing clothes for obese cats).  His one bright spot is Linda (Marisa Tomei).  Coming from a better background, and chafing against Dave's inability to show affection (or anything else) Linda's feelings for Dave are a miracle.

On the verge of losing out on a promising new position, and while enroute to a business meeting in St Louis, Dave is arrested for ""air rage"" (the flick opened about 18 months after 9/11, and feels that the heightened sensitivities of airline workers is now stand-up material).  Convicted of assaulting a flight attendant (don't ask), Dave is sentenced to anger management classes.  Unfortunately, his counselor is Buddy Rydell, a cheerful psychotic specialist in anger management played by Jack Nicholson.  Overflowing with bromides on rage control (""Temper's the one thing you can't get rid of, by losing it""), Buddy is a bit of a ticking bomb himself.  At first grouped with Buddy's other rage-challenged clients (including John Turtorro as an army vet suffering post-traumatic stress from Grenada), Dave is sentenced to a more intense regimen once he gets waylaid on another disastrous encounter in a bar (don't ask!)  Now forced to endure Buddy everywhere he goes, Dave must re-examine his life on a daily basis and confront every possible source of his anger - childhood bullies now grown, his abusive boss, his sexual insecurities (the film has a recurring obsession with male anatomy) and his fear of losing Linda.

""Anger Management"" has its share of surprises, but not many.  It's the latest in a long-line of movies starring Sandler as a hopeless loser who must undergo a painful or embarrassing transformation if he's to find love.  Nicholson and Sandler work together better than the script deserves, and the flick works a fine line without having them become great friends or enemies at each others throats.

Like taking a cheese grater to your nether-regions, this movie is unthinkably painful to watch.

1499032,3,B00005JM4Q,"Sometimes I like to be fair minded.  My limited impression of Adam Sandler was that he always seems to play an annoying weird guy.  He was decent in The Wedding Singer but the traielrs on all his other movies seemed incredibly stupid.  Since Jack Nicolson and Marrisa Tomei were playing opposite Sandler, I figured why not give the man a break.

Somewhat to my surprise, Sandler's character did not come accross as totally looney, weird, or semi-retarded.  David Buznik(Sandler's character) plays a timid businessman who is always afraid of confronting others and standing up for his rights.  An incident aboard an airplane causes Buznik to undergo Anger Management therapy. There are many oddball scenarios that occur between Buznik and Dr. Buddy Rydell.

The uncertainty that Buznik feels about his new live in shrink,Buddy Rydell has some comic moments but other spots of shear annoyance.  However, through all the lunacy the good doctor Rydell slowly gets David Buznik to differentiate between good anger and bad anger.  Whereas the climatic scene at Yankee Stadium is oh so silly, David Buznik finally realizes that only he needs to take more of a stand in controlling his life.

Somehow I feel the script could have been a more sensible comedy instead of a crazy silly comedy.  Nonetheless, Jack Nicolson's commanding performance does elevate this film.  Notable performances by Woody Harrelson and John Tarturo help as well as the usual schtick from Sandler and Tomei.

1499038,3,B00005JM4Q,"Possible Spoilers Ahead:
I have to admit that I am not a big Adam Sandler fan.  However, I saw the trailers and I was intrigued by the thought of Sandler playing a regular guy to an over-the-top Jack Nicholson.  About halfway through the movie, I had trouble following the storyline.  I think this was due to Sandler playing his mild mannered Dave Buznik character too calm in the beginning.  While I understand the concept of a guy who internalizes his anger (which is why he was a candidate for Anger Management classes), even guys who internalize their anger show some frustration when there are problems.  I thought Buznik's overly calm reactions seemed unrealistic during the entire flight attendant hostility `over the headset' episode.  I suppose Sandler was trying to go for no reactions at first and building up, over the course of the movie, to more obvious displays of anger (like the fight with his grade school nemesis turned Buddhist monk), but he started out so overly calm at the beginning, it was hard for me to understand whether he was acting or not. While the West Side Story 'I Feel Pretty' bit had some amusing possibilities, the Buznik character started well (frazzled at being forced to stop on the bridge and sing for his bizarre therapist), but the singing soon became too much like Sandler doing his singing bits for SNL, and not Buznik trying to placate his therapist so he could get to work.  This may explain why some of the other reviewers gave this movie a thumbs down.  I did find the second half more entertaining, mainly because I thought the Buznik character seemed to be reacting in a more realistic fashion to hostility directed at him.  I didn't mind the final scene at Yankee Stadium, but I didn't think the cameos from the baseball players were required.  While it was nice to see Rudy Giullani, that part could have also gone to someone playing just a regular guy in the stands rooting for the guy to propose to the girl at these sporting events (I didn't think all of the cameos were required - or added anymore laughs to the film).

This movie is great - if you like Jack, as he's hilarious throughout. However, the rest of the movie seems to die a slow death after the opening scenes. It was such a great original idea for a movie, but Jack seems to struggle to hold up the movie.

Sandler's character gets bullied around cause he directs his anger inwards instead of expressing it when appropriate. This is also why he gets anger management treatment. First lesson: anger management is not only about choleric but also about people who are unable to let out their anger and thus are in danger of to freaking out some day.
I think overall the humor was nice and sometimes intelligent. Unfortunately it becomes obvious very soon that the therapy is an elaborate ploy to get Sandler to express his emotions. At first I liked how the movie showed Sandler expressing more and more emotions, letting his anger out but what was subtle in the beginning gets predictable and obvious very soon.
Also I never thought for a second that ""Buddy"" is really hitting on Sandler's girlfriend or that he tries to steal Sandler's idea for proposing. Talking about Buddy - Jack Nicholson's performance really held the movie together, I really liked his acting in this movie, some funny stuff here.
The supporting characters were nicely done although John Turturro's character and those other two wackos were bothersome. I liked the cat and John McEnroe's cameo a lot btw...
Oh and don't mind the suspense of disbelief, like how the girlfriend pays for this treatment, but when watching comedies, you should always leave your sense for in-movie-realism outside.
What I liked about this movie was that it doesn't rely on creating humor through embarrassment all the time like many other awkward Sandler-flicks do. I really don't like this type of humor.
Unfortunately the ending is totally overdone and disgustingly corny. It really spoiled the movie for me. All in all I give this movie 5 points out of 10 (because of the bad ending).

Adam Sandler's goofball antics & overall pretty funny punch lines paired up with Jack Nicholson's ""man of 1,000 face"" on screen personna seemed to be quite good.  However, the laughs were some, but not enough to be enjoyable really.
The plot itself is quite good, Sandler throws a fit on a plane & is ordered by a judge to attend anger management classes with Nicholson.  Nicholson teaches him to get over his anger problems by being a jerk & getting upset about little things, whereas Sandler stays fairly meek throughout the flick's first part, but lets it all out more & more in the second.
Jack easily does the better job in the movie, by being more & more hostile in the movie.  He also has some great punch lines, moments of comic genius, & purely great moments.  Adam, however, stays fairly boring in the movie with just some of his typical goofball antics in the movie, but his scene is when he goes after Jack towards the end of the movie.  I feel if Adam would've lashed out & fought back against Jack more instead of being meek, the flick could have been better.

1499258,4,B00005JM4Q,"Someday I'll write a movie review, where I agree with a majority of the reviewers but this is not someday. I suppose my problem is that I don't try to analyze and dissect a movie, by separately examining the various components of the movie. I deal in the big picture. Did I enjoy the movie and to what extent did I enjoy it?
In the case of Anger Management, while not a rolling in the isles funny movie, I found it to be a clever, well written, well directed, well acted and quite funny, which is the purpose of the movie.
Plot
The story starts out where a bully, thoroughly embarrasses an unsuspecting, young(12 years) David Buznik (later played by Adam Sandler)by pulling down his pants in public as he is about to kiss a young attractive girl.
Fast forward twenty-five years and a timid, unassertive Dave is now a secretary (Sandler gets all the good parts)whose immediate supervisor (Kurt Fuller) is .... a bully.
While flying to St. Louis on a business trip, Dave, trying innocently to get headphones from a flight attendant, incredulously gets arrested for assault.
To his and his flaky lawyers astonishment, Dave is found guilty, fined $3,500 and ordered to undergo two weeks of anger management.
Enter the wacky and witty Dr. Buddy Rydell (Jack Nicholson), as Dave's anger consoler, who seems to have Dave perform one crazy, illogical thing after another, including matching him up with a volatile, psychotic, member of the therapy group, Chuck (John Turturo)as an anger partner. This partnership shortly leads to Dave again going before the judge after an agitated Chuck starts a fight in a bar and Dave gets dragged in.
The Judge sentences Dave to one year in jail or 30 days intensive, hands on therapy, which, to Daves surprise, involves Buddy, moving in and going to work with him.
It is at this point that Buddy first notices a later meets Dave's girlfriend Linda (Marisa Tomei) and seems to develop a unhealthy interest in her, which in turn, seems to lead him to perpetrate even stranger and more eratic treatments upon Dave, such as taking him to meet a German transvestite hooker (Woody Harrelson) and forcing him to accost a beautiful girl (Heather Graham)in a bar, with some off the wall line, which to Dave's surprise works.
Conclusion
The movie was well directed by Peter Segal and overall the cast did a good job of acting, however, I thought John Turturo did an exceptional job of playing the on the edge, psycho (maybe he don't have to act) and Nicholson was brilliant with that Devilish, devious look of his. They ought to make a movie where he gets to play the Devil. They did? Well see, I told you he ought to play the Devil!680",1077494400,,2656,4.677350427350428

It's (with the exception of Nicholson) really not funny at all and it just seems to go on too long without going anywhere or doing anything. The ending was also awful. Are we really supposed to believe that Sandler would want to marry his girlfriend after she put him through all that? Don't buy this movie. Rent it once if you have nothing better to do and you're going to get drunk or something while you watch it.,1077408000,3,536,4.163461538461538
1499260,4,B00005JM4Q,"No. It isn't. ANGER MANAGEMENT is easily Adam Sandler's best work since THE WEDDING SINGER so by the law of statistics that means we can expect an above average movie from him at least every five years. (But hey, there are CHIMPS out there who are more proficient at math that I am. At least that's what one of my former teachers told me. Bald old prat).
After a stupid misunderstanding on board a plane (trying to poke fun at post 9/11 paranoia) David Buznik (Sandler who also co- Executive produced) is accused of assaulting an air hostess (a timely dig at all that P.C nonsense) and winds up in court. He is fined $3500 and ordered to attend 20 hours of anger management therapy. To Buznik's horror, his group therapist is Dr Buddy Rydell (Jack Nicholson) who happened to be a passenger on the same plane that fateful day. Coincidence?  Or just Hollywood slothfulness?
Other members of the anger management group all turn out to be dysfunctional. This includes a pair of bi-sexual female porn stars/ lovers who are in therapy because of one of them is angry at her partner kissing another woman- which they consider to be taboo territory in their business!, an over zealous football fan (NZ is full of them) who can only be calmed by chanting ""Goos fraba"" (there's a feature on the DVD that explains all this, so I don't feel any great need to go into detail about it.)
But despite David being the least disturbed member of the group, Rydell takes the unusual step of DOUBLING his therapy time to 40 hours. This sees Buznik buddied up with the groups' most disturbed individual, a former war veteran named Chuck who describes himself as ""half Irish, half me, half Italian"".
But this intervention fails to work, and David soon finds himself back before the court after becoming involved in another brawl. This further hurts his now fragile relationship with his girlfriend Linda (Marisa Tomei). However this time his skin is saved by Dr. Rydell who manages to get his therapy time extended by another month. The only catch is Rydell must move in with David and supervise him around the clock. The joke here is that the supposedly eternally calm Doctor is prone to outbursts of anger and his therapy tactics start to become more and more eccentric & unorthodox- joggling on the thin line between genius and madness.
Standout scenes include a gag which involves Nicholson smashing a car window with a golf club (a few years back he wound up in the headlines for doing just that) and an unbilled Heather Graham making a brief appearance in her underwear (Yeah baby!) as well as cameos by Woody Harrelson, John C Reilly and Rudy Guliani. But the highlight of the movie for me is the sequence where Rydell has Dave confront the guy who used to bully him at school; who is now a Buddhist (Isn't that typical? You find religion and it makes everything all right! What a cop-out!
In fact ANGER MANAGEMENT is Grade A comedy until the (deep breath) TYPICALLY SAPPY HOLLYWOOD ENDING which may leave you feeling cheated. Blame Writer David Dorfman. That remains my only complaint. Heck, if I gave it four stars, Sandler fanatics will revere this as a modern classic! (No offence intended. We're all entitled to our opinions). Just watch the movie, and enjoy it.

1499261,4,B00005JM4Q,"I'd like to say first that going in, I really wanted to like this movie.  It being an Adam Sandler movie, I expected some laugh-out-loud scenes wrapped around a limp plotline.  But the pairing with Jack Nicholson really intrigued me, causing much  higher expectations than I might ordinarily have for an admittedly screw-ball comedy.
Well, I wasn't disappointed.  Nicholson was great in this role which allowed him to show a wider emotional range than I've ever seen him attempt before.  He's done pent-up before, he's done crazy before, he's done mischievous before, but not all in the same movie.  He deliberately left his defenses down, showing an unguarded vulnerability that makes him, well, lovable, in the same sort of way that uncle of yours is, the one who your relatives all talk about.  When was the last time you could say that about any Nicholson character?
Sandler hits the perfect notes in his portrayal of a put-upon nebbish who finds himself caught up in an alternate reality where violent people use the system to pin their misdeeds on him.  Yes, he's played this sort of part before, but this time he doesn't so much continuosly explode with temperous rage, a la Happy Gilmore, than get embroiled into the craziness that constantly surrounds him.
Well, I got exactly what I expected: quite a few belly laughs and dead-on performances by the stars.  And surprizingly (refreshingly so?), a very well written script.  Although there is no way I would let my children under 17 see this -- some of the humor takes advantage of sexual or perverse situations that I wouldn't want to try to explain to them -- I do recommend it as a guilty pleasure for any adult.",1077062400,,1674,4.78125

The intention is good. The actors are great. The general plot is interesting.

The script stunk. It lacked a sense of reality. It followed along a jumpy line that made believing what was going on difficult.

I saw it because I like Jack Nicholson and Adam Sandler.

I never bought Nicholson as a counselor. He wore the beard of the stereotyped psychologist, but lacked the boorish austerity. Nicholson is likable in any role, but here, he has few good lines, and fewer good scenes. Too much of what he did, like forcing David (Sandler's character) to let him with him stay for 30 days couldn't be right. Why didn't David know when he was sentenced? Why was it a surprise?

Sandler is Sandler. He played a smarter version of his ""Waterboy."" You know the shtick. Funny then, not funny now. The routine needs more depth if he thinks he wants to do comedy in a few years.

There is little movie here worth watching. As cool as Jack is, and as funny as Adam is, the movie is poorly written, giving two screens stars a movie they'll regret later.

I agree with another viewer that Jack was simply a major irritant, and except for Marisa Tomei I thought none of the actors brought much to the table. The dialogue was predictable and without comedic merit.  Why did someone of Jack's calibre sign on to do this film? After the first hour, my wife and I turned to one another simultaneously and asked if the other wouldn't mind watching a rerun of Will and Grace.",1071792000,6,563,4.446601941747573

1499396,3,B00005JM4Q,"I looked forward to seeing this movie and waited until it recently hit dvd to rent it. I'm so glad I saved my money doing so. In what should've been a really funny movie turned out to be a very slow paced, laugh every 20 minutes type movie. In my opinion Sandler's last comedy (Mr. Deeds)was his worst comedy movie but this one soon may take over. This film truly suffers from being too predictable and WAY too many jokes about the size of Sandler's character's manhood (got old after the first joke yet it seems like it's mentioned in every scene). The acting is good though it's just not the comedy it should be, especially with these two going head to head. Jack doesn't take too many roles like this and you would expect him to pull off a Deniro type performance (what was up with the I Feel Pretty song, which was also used in Analyze That, wasn't it). Hearing Deniro sing a showtune was funny but it felt old and stale once Jack started singing it.
It's too bad that this movie didn't live up to it's expectations because it could've been one of those great comedies. Sandler like I said is really lacking it these days and that's kinda sad but he basically plays the same type character in every film anyways and Punch Drunk Love wasn't his Jim Carrey type turn he was hoping for. Sadly both Sandler and Carrery seemed to loose a step or two but hopefully like Carrey, Sandler can rebound with a hit like Jim did with Bruce Almighty.",1070150400,2,1440,4.376865671641791
1499397,1,B00005JM4Q,"At present, the only thing i could think of that would be unfunnier than this sorry excuse for a comedy is that Jack Nicholson has reduced himself to this. If it weren't for his past we'd be talking guaranteed career suicide, Hugh Grant style.
""Anger management"" is actually incredibly accurate in its title, as any viewer with a functioning cerebrum will testify: if you (for whatever reason) do sit through this film you will definately not get up in a calm mood. If you paid to see it you will need some money management therapy too. And if you rented it throw in some time management for desert.
  Dont worry, no spoilers ahead, because there's no need to go over the plot for such a waste of celluloid.
  I'll keep it to the extreme basics here: a totally silly, seriously unfunny film, with Nicholson playing the shrink of a guy who needs anger management. The plot could have easily been written by a 1000 monkeys typing away randomly at typewriters.
  There is (i hear) an attempt at humor in this film. If this holds true (i didn't discover any such success in it) then i must be totally lacking at humor. But hey, what do i know, i thought ""A fish called Wanda"" was funny, but obviously there must be a new frequency of humor around that I'm not catching on to.
  Avoid it is if there's no tomorrow.

A bad effort, Well the story starts when Dave (Sandler) is growing up in a urban neighborhood, The movie shows that he is not well... having the best childhood he could've had.

Sandler gets on a flight to a business meeting about 25 years later. Well if you have seen the commercial you know what happens. ""Mam can I get a pair of headphones"", ""One second sir"", ""Mam can you hurry it up I've been waiting for 10 minutes"", ""Sir calm down!"", ""etc..etc..."" and presto he winds up in anger management.
Now I know what your thinking ""Whats he talking about?"" well the humor is well mostly dry. A few ""classic"" sandler stuff but nothing to get hyped up about. The ending literally made me cry it was so funny. But that was it. The beginning, the end and the ridiculous line ""Goosfraba""

1499540,2,B00005JM4Q,"Like so many other reviewers, I picked up this movie because of its star power.  It does not seem like you could go wrong with Adam Sandler and Jack Nicholson.  Looks like I was wrong though...
Sandler's character does not have any anger issues, and it is frustrating to see his character go through so many runs of bad luck, and get blamed for things that are not his fault.  All of the incidents rely on personal injuries and extreme immaturity, and I guess this is what the writers thought would make a good comedy.  Unfortunately for them, it did not get too many laughs from our audience.
If you can hold on for the last twenty minutes, things do clear up a little, and seem to be a little more sane. (The trick is just sitting through the first 75 minutes of the movie!) However it is not clear how Sandler comes out as a better person for all the time he spent in his sessions with Buddy (Nicholson).

I was also impressed with how funny Jack Nicholson's character came across as well. These two played off each other as if they had been doing movies side by side for years. After a really bad ""Little Nicky"" and an average at best ""Mr. Deeds"" Sandler finally brings us a film that made us realize why we liked him so much in the first place.
It's hard to say much about the film without including spoilers, so I won't. Just do yourself a favor and don't miss this one for non-stop laughs from start to finish.",1069113600,,801,4.382550335570469
1499542,5,B00005JM4Q,"The first time that I saw this movie on video, I was disappointed and told my 'Nicholson fan' friends so.  Since the ending is a surprise, when I watched it again I saw the whole storyline in a different light.  I actually found myself watching it several more times to catch more and more of the layers and details.
As annoying as Nicholson was in this movie, one cannot take his character [Buddy Rydel] at face value.  When you consider the ending and go back over all his dialogue, you begin to see that he was very up front and truthful about most everything he told Dave (Sandler).  I later became convinced of the sincerity of Buddy (Nicholson) in other situations--like provoking Dave with Galaxia.  If you watch this movie more than once you put on different lenses and see from a different vantage point.
I agree with other reviewers--the first viewing may have you despising Nicholson and giving a thumbs down to the film.  I did at first.  Now it grew on me to be one of my favorites..
One of my favorite characters in this movie was Chuck.  I love his wild looks, and many of his lines are my favorites... ""no more fudgicles"" and ""you're not ready"" - the Granada stuff, etc.
WAs Buddy just being outrageously disgusting and perverse when he flipped off rival ""Linda's best friend"" ...? - I think not.  If you watch the film with a different paradigm, you can see that Buddy was truly doing ""his work"", and that included not only protecting Dave (Sandler), but having the innate manly ability to discern an enemy to Sandler and ""the cause"" he's undertaken to help.
There are even a couple of times when Nicholson is even impressed with how his student [Sandler] fared during the process...in my opinion when he brought ""the girls"" to the club (strong move) and also when he dealt with his childhood nemesis who had become a monk.  That has to be the funniest scene in the movie!
If you have ever known a nice guy with implosive anger, this will really strike a chord.  If you have ever sat in a group counseling session (like 12 step), then you will laugh noddingly.
Anger Management.  At first I didn't like it.  Watched it some more, and I'm still seeing new things in it.  I really like it a lot.
Jack Nicholson - annoying and dopey OR masterful?  Nicholson is not going to (at this stage in his career and life) allow himself to be in a dud movie.  I say that this one has some layers to mine for gold...
Hope you will give it another try!",1068508800,6,2454,4.444196428571429
1499543,2,B00005JM4Q,"It's funny how buddy movies have transformed over the years. During the eighties there was a supply and demand for cop-buddy films, such as ""48 Hrs.,"" ""Red Heat,"" and even ""Turner and Hootch."" During the nineties there was a supply and demand for road comedy movies, for the most part. And now there seems to be a supply of Adam Sandler movies, with half-and-half demand. The younger crowds love him, and usually the older hoards of people despise him.
In ""Anger Management,"" Sandler tries his hand at a buddy formula. It works on occassion, is at often times quite humorous, but fails to deliver what I really expected until the last thirty minutes, which finally gets some nice laughs in on a consistent basis.
Sandler plays Dave Buznik, a generally peaceful young man who is flying on business. On the flight, Dave sits next to Buddy Rydell (Jack Nicholson), an obnoxious loudmouth (or so it appears at first glance) who insists that Dave should watch the in-flight movie Buddy himself is watching. Dave asks a flight attendant for a set of headphones, the stewardess starts chatting up a friend, the headphones never come. Dave asks again, and suddenly the stewardess is asking him not to yell. The next thing he knows, he's in an anger management program for assaulting a flight attendant, even though he simply touched her arm to stop her from walking away down the aisle, ignoring him.
Big surprise for Dave when he finds out the anger management program is run by Buddy Rydell, who invites Dave to an anger group, comprised of Chuck (John Turturro), a crazy man who believes everyone hates him, Lou (Luis Guzman), who is gay, and two female lovers.
Dave, who is not angry nor crazy, starts to think everyone else is, as Buddy moves into his apartment and even follows him to work. This of course gets in the way of his relationship with his girlfriend, Linda (Marisa Tomei), who says they need to have some ""time apart."" You can expect what happens in the rest of the film.
I was disappointed in this film overall. The first thirty minutes were painfully unfunny and predictable. The end somewhat redeems itself, but still doesn't make the film as great as it could have been given the potential.
The cast is stellar, ranging from Nicholson to Kevin Nealon to an uncredited cameo by Heather Graham. I found it humorous that most of the cast has been in P.T. Anderson's films: Heather Graham, Luis Guzman, and Adam Sandler have all been in at least one of Anderson's films.
But a great cast cannot always save a movie, and though ""Anger Management"" has a lot going for it, the film itself fails to go where it should. I actually DO like Adam Sandler, but this movie was unfortunately just so-so and nothing more.",1068422400,2,2719,4.690376569037657

Anyways, the poor thing soon gets wrongly accused of a crime he ""commits"" in a plane and the punishment the judge comes up with is : Anger Management therapy. There he meets the person who witnessed the crime he had ""committed"" and he happens to be his counselor. But things don't go Adam Sandler's way.

SANDLER's films (though never avant garde) have looked and felt the same since HAPPY GILMORE, which was a laugh riot of a movie and led one to believe that the half hour comedy hour comic had the ability to create movie personas that elevated above standard SAT. NIGHT LIVE box office junk.  Too bad GILMORE was his opus and he has apparently run out of funny ink.  I tried to keep watching this flick past the groan inducing WOODY HARRLESON German transvestite hooker scene, but had to call it quits after the next cameo, which I am embarrased for HEATHER GRAHAM to have watched.  As with most of SANDLER's earlier escapades, the supporting players are better than the general material, but even that redeeming quality no longer exsists and especially not here.  Pop in HAPPY GIMORE again and revel in the days when instead of beating up his career, SANDLER makes us laugh by beating up BOB BARKER.",1067644800,4,1380,4.47410358565737

Buddy has big plans for David and is determined to cure him of his ""anger problems"" once and for all... that is, if the two don't end up killing each other.  The results are hilarious and unpredictable in this wildly entertaining comedy, ""Anger Management.""
Who would've thought that we would one day see a movie with Adam Sandler and Jack Nicholson working side-by-side.  The end result is pretty entertaining and impressive.  ""Anger Management"" has one goal and one goal only; to make people laugh.  This movie is not looking to receive any Academy Awards; nor is it looking to get high critical acclaim.  This is here to make us laugh and is not here to make the world a better place.  And, I happen to think that it succeeds.
The movie is very funny and surprising.  Sandler and Nicholson make a terrific team, as you can tell that they enjoyed every minute of it.  There's a lot of wonderful actors in this, such as Marisa Tomei, Luis Guzman, John Turturro and many more.  The script is pretty funny and comical.  While the story isn't flawless or ingenious, it's still a nice premise and keeps us entertained throughout the duration of the movie.  There's a lot of cool twists and turns that will keep your complete attention and keeps the movie fresh and interesting.
I really love the DVD for this movie, as I think they did an excellent job of putting it together.  There's a lot of cool extras on it and the picture quality looks great.  The only downside to it is that I don't think it has the best sound.  You can hear a little distortion at times.  It's nothing major, but it is noticeable.  Special features included are trailers, two featurettes, audio commentary from Sandler and the director, a gag reel and a DVD-ROM game.  The commentary from Sandler and the director is very amusing and informative (we even learn that the movie came very close to getting an ""R-rating"" due to some of the ""crude humor"").  It's a great package for a movie like this.
""Anger Management"" is a hilarious movie for many reasons.  It is clear that Sandler and Nicholson make an excellent comedic team.  While it may not be the best Sandler movie out there, it is still a great one nonetheless.  Again, this movie is not looking for a place on an AFI list of great movies or anything like that.  It is what it is; a comedy.  If you're looking for a movie that could change the world... you may want to look elsewhere.  If you're looking for a fun movie that's amusing and entertaining, this may be the one for you to pick.  I enjoyed it very much and will continue to watch it many times over.",1067644800,2,2927,4.575

But this one tops it (or bottoms it). Ladies and gentlemen, the NEW lamest excuse for a movie ever: Anger Management.

If you saw the ads, you've seen the movie - I hesitate to say ""the best parts"", since even those were weak, but the key plot points, anyway. Adam Sandler plays a gentle guy who doesnt get angry until driven there by angry people, forced into anger management with a borderline pycho, and then periodically made angry. But it's the same scene (and idea) over and over and over and over and over again.

It's like a really bad Saturday Night Live skit that never should have happened, and didn't know when to stop. I'm guessing it actually began as an idea of SNL and it should have stayed there - as a discard idea.

1499640,2,B00005JM4Q,"A film by Peter Segal
For a movie with so much potential it sure was a let down.  This could have been a real show-off piece for Adam Sandler, working with Jack Nicholson.  The idea was good, Sandler being required to take an anger management class from Nicholson.  The execution was poor.  The bottom line is that the movie just wasn't funny.
Dave (Adam Sandler) is a very non-confrontational man.  He has to fly out on a business trip.  When he calmly and quietly asks the flight attendant for headphones, the flight attendant freaks out, tells him to calm down and with every word that Dave says, she gets more and more alarmed until an air marshal steps in.  We next see Dave in court where he is convicted for assaulting the flight attendant and he is assigned an anger management course.  The doctor leading the course is Dr Buddy Rydell (Jack Nicholson).  Rydell appears to be slightly unhinged and as Dave works with the doctor, Rydell ends up getting Dave in more and more trouble until successfully completing the anger management training is the only hope to keep Dave out of prison.
The whole problem stems from the fact that right from the start, the movie is not funny.  Considering the premise of Dave being put into anger management, I guess the point was that Dave exhibited no signs of anger.  The only problem is that during the scene on the airplane it was so obvious that Dave had done nothing wrong that it just sucked all the humor out of the scene.  The flight attendant wasn't over-reacting, she was reacting to nothing at all.  I thought the movie started out not being funny, and continued not being funny throughout the whole movie.  There were a couple of light chuckles, but that's about it.  I can't recommend this movie, and would suggest that people avoid this one.",1066780800,4,1798,4.610062893081761

A very hard thing to do you might think, but director Peter Segal and writer David Dorfman manage just that!! A success of the wrong kind!
So much expectations and most importantly potential, with so little return, proving yet again that in order for a movie, even one starring the great Nicholson,to succeed,it has to have an equally talented writer, director and production team.
Having said that, it is not a bad movie per se,and there are just very few scenes that are funny, but these are very far and few in between  and do not make one whole movie.
I think the script is the main culprit! An over the top Nicholson (playing the eccentric but wise mentor who changes the life of his protege, a character often seen in cinema), an annoyingly calm Sandler(even his rare outbursts are somehow not convincing), the character of Turturro who comes out as  more aggressive and unstable than angry(I was wondering this man should have been locked up ages ago !!).
The only bright spot in the film was Luiz Guzman who is always excellent and adds a lot to his roles,and of course the pairing of Krista Allen and January Jones as two porn stars/lovers who kiss in the middle of the anger management session (I was thinking this alone is capable of turning the angriest of men to sweet little puppies!), but even this scene was unnecessary and you really feel it does not belong to the movie!

Jack Nicholson is always associated with ""quality acting"" & the temptation is too great to see the pairing between him & Adam Sandler, who has definitely coming of age from his heyday of Happy Gilmour.  These days, his performance is more sedated but funny just the same. Some of my friends were rather disappointed with this movie for the jokes were falling flat but truth to be told, I just find the whole movie hillarious.  Cameo appearances is definitely a big plus & am I right to say that this movie is pro-New York with people such as ex-Mayor Gulliani, John McEnroe, Heather Graham, John C. Reilly, Yankee Stadium chipping in their efforts?  The counselling group that Bruznik (Adam's character) attended to are a funny bunch & they definitely add another dimension to this movie.  The subplot is about how Bruznik needs to overcome his confidence problem in order to express his love unconditionally to his long-term girlfriend by kissing her in public, played by Marisa Tomei.  Another subplot would be whether Jack's character is deviously plotting to take Marisa's character from Bruznik by befriending him at the first place.  Overall, it's harmless fun & it's definitely a joyride.  After the movie, I dare to say that I feel heaps better.  Highly recommended",1065830400,2,1515,4.929133858267717

After a misunderstanding on an airplane ride, and a really horrible lawyer, Dave must attend Anger Management with Buddy, played by Nicholsan.  The hilarious stuff Dave goes through and the sweet, though a bit predictable ending all adds up to a great film.

It's not until the very end that everything becomes clear, and that's good plot management.  You don't feel lost along the way, and it's not predictable at all ... the writers guide you safely and humorously through the entire movie, then surprise you at the end.  I love that!  Now, how funny was it?  The movie stars Adam Sandler and Jack Nicholson, and as shown in the previews, Jack Nicholson winds up living with Adam Sandler ... what could be funnier, right?  Well, sort of.  In my opinion, the previews were too funny because they set the laugh expectation too high.  After seeing the previews, I expected this film to be an absolute laugh-fest.  It was not.  Nonetheless, it was funny (very funny and uncomfortably funny in parts) and well worth the watch.  I'm just saying that you will enjoy the movie more if you go into it with lesser expectations than I did.  That said, a little about the plot ...
Sandler plays a soft-spoken, docile administrative assistant to a credit-stealing, jerk of an executive.  His girlfriend is played by Marisa Tomei, who is adorable as usual.  Early in the movie, Sandler winds up sitting next to Nicholson on a plane.  While Nicholson is boisterous and annoying, Sandler remains calm.  However, at Nicholson's prodding, Sandler asks the flight attendant for headphones ... three times.  On the final request, the flight attendant accuses Sandler of being hostile, even though he never raises his voice.  Sandler winds up being zapped by the US Marshall on the flight, and taken into custody for assaulting the flight attendant.  In court, where Kevin Nealon plays Sandler's lawyer, Sandler is ordered to enroll in Nicholson's anger management program.  To Sandler's surprise, the crazy man from the plane is going to be his psychologist.  Thus starts the antics of the film.  I won't spoil the humorous gags of the film, which span most of it, so I'll just say that the remainder of the movie is bizarre and comedic ... and worth the watch.
Side note:  In true Sandler style, this movie features cameos from stand-out characters in his earlier work ... the butler from Mr. Deeds, Kevin Nealon, and his best friend from The Wedding Singer all have parts in this film.  Surprisingly, I didn't see Rob Schneider pop up in this one.  But I love this about Sandler's films -- quirky and funny, just like him.",1065744000,,2490,4.721577726218097
1499781,3,B00005JM4Q,"Jack Nicholson and Adam Sandler should have made funnier bedfellows in Anger Management. In fact, the title and trailers were a little misleading, portraying Sandler to be a raving lunatic in serious need of Anger Management. The truth though is that Sandler's character displays none of his trademark rage until the very end of Anger Management. Sandler's understated treatment of his character Dave Buznick comes off as just plain annoying, he is a timid junior executive for a pet clothing company and stepped on by boss on a daily basis. Nicholson is funny in spurts but this is a far cry from his Oscar winning performance in As Good As it Gets. I kept waiting for something really funny to happen between Jack and Sandler but sadly it never came. There are some funny parts like singing in traffic or the monk scene but overall this film is just not as funny as it should have been.

1499930,3,B00005JM4Q,"This sounded so promising. Jack Nicholson and Adam Sandler both have enough anxiety and quirks built around their personnas to make a rich, satisfying comedy. If Anger Management falls a bit flat, it's more to do with the uneven screenplay and direction than the performers. Both Sandler and Nicholson give solid comedic performances. Although Nicholson coasts on his personality here playing a variation on characters he's played before, Sandler actually stretches a bit in his role. It's nothing compared to the stretch we saw in the dark comedy/drama Punch Drunk Love, but it's a step up from The Waterboy.
The plot in a nutshell--Sandler plays an executive assistant at a firm that designs clothing for fat cats. He's always had a problem with intimacy since a bully pulled down his shorts while he shared his first kiss. As a result, he's also quiet and not very aggressive about going after what he wants. While on a flight he asks for a headset from a flight attendant. He asks several times, is assured he'll get it, only to be ignored. When he asks one final time (quite calmly) the flight attendant accuses him of being out of control and verbally abusive. A Marshall becomes involved and puts him under arrest. He's sentenced to an anger management course and fined as a result. The only problem--the doctor running the anger management course appears to nuts and having issues with anger himself. At one point he moves in with Sandler's character and forces him to proposition a complete stranger (even though Sandler's character has a girlfriend), partner with a psychotic as part of his buddy system and and confront his weasel of a boss. Ultimately, he does control his anger but learns to stand up for himself.
Some of the cameos are inspired while others fall completely flat. The most bizarre is, perhaps, Woody Harrelson's performance in drag. The feel good happy ending kinda comes out of nowhere and undercuts the dark comedy elements that do work well here (particularly the encounter with a bully that used to pick on Sandler's character who is now--surprise--a Buddist Monk (played by the talented John C. Rilley).
The DVD looks very good and the sound is up to the high standards we've come to expect from DVDs. The extras are a what we've come to expect  and, while the outtakes aren't as gut splittingly funny as one would hope, there are a couple of chuckles to be found. The featurettes are a bit quirky if, again, predictable.
Although Anger Management doesn't live up to its potential (which is a pity but that's no surprise given the way the script and film was probably compromised by the egos of the actors involved), it has a number of truly funny moments. The film is at its best when it's unpredictable. Unfortunately, most of the film falls into a rut. It's like laying eyes on a new rollercoaster that looks unusual; you find that while it looks pretty good once you ride it the twists and turns are pretty familiar. The ride's still enjoyable even if it is predictable.",1065225600,2,3009,4.786538461538462

1499932,2,B00005JM4Q,"With that frazzled hair, that just-swallowed-the-canary grin, and that sly, mischievous, devil-may-care gleam in his eye, Jack Nicholson does the controlled-mania shtick better than anyone working in movies today.  But even his presence isn't enough to prevent ""Anger Management"" from emerging as a decidedly unfunny comedy, one that ends up wasting the talents of Adam Sandler, Marisa Tomei, John Turturro, Woody Harrelson and Luis Guzman as well.
The David Dorfman screenplay is yet another of those ""high concept"" package deals - replete with contrived plots and big-name movie stars in the leads - that look irresistible to all those corporate green-lighters at the studio, but which fall to pieces the moment they come to fruition on the big screen.  Sandler plays a mild-mannered, put-upon schnook who is unfairly and inexplicably convicted of assaulting a stewardess on an airplane.  Much to Sandler's chagrin, the court consigns him to the care of Nicholson, a well-known anger management specialist who is more certifiably psychotic than the patients he is ostensibly helping.  The strained, manufactured plot is little more than an excuse to give Nicholson a chance to chew the scenery and Sandler to act bemused, befuddled and benumbed.  Unfortunately, that's pretty much how the audience feels after 106 minutes of nonstop crudity, predictability and over-the-top ranting.  Director Peter Segal tries desperately to make the whole enterprise come across as madcap, witty and anarchic, but with virtually every single joke and set-up fizzling and sputtering out, the film ends up feeling merely chaotic and desperate.
The filmmakers have peppered their movie with any number of cameo appearances by some famous real life New Yorkers, but their performances are so thoroughly inept and wretched that ""Anger Management"" begins to feel more like amateur night at the Roxy than a multimillion-dollar Hollywood production.  This is most acutely felt in the painfully awkward and embarrassingly mawkish climactic moments played out, stereotypically, before a packed house at Yankee Stadium (didn't we see this scene a few years back in ""Never Been Kissed""?).  Moreover, the ""surprise"" ending requires that we suspend disbelief more than is advisable even for a film of this nature, which could never expect us to believe for a fleeting moment anything that is going on here.
In what is a bizarre fluke of fate, I suppose, ""Anger Management"" turns out to be the second film in recent months to feature characters massacring and mangling the Bernstein and Sondheim song ""I Feel Pretty"" from ""West Side Story.""  What I said about this phenomenon in my review of ""Analyze That"" holds true here as well:  that filmmakers with a dubious movie on their hands should avoid reminding us of a much better film while we are being asked to suffer through theirs.  It only makes the experience that much more painful.",1064707200,13,2909,5.247844827586207

Some reviewers were trying to compare it to other Nicholson or Sandler movies, and maybe that's why they rated it low. Every movie has to be rated on its own merits, and this one certainly deserves five stars.
 No matter what you thought, the ending of Anger Management in Yankee Stadium, which is the best non-baseball segment ever filmed in a real Major League park, is worth the five stars on its own. The rest of this wonderful movie is just a build-up to this magnificent ending.
The cameos, by top actors and actresses, with some not even credited, only add to the hilarious plot. This is a film you could see many times, and never stop laughing.",1064707200,,813,4.456375838926174
1499934,2,B00005JM4Q,"At first hearing of the concept, you would think that it was a fun premise for a comedy. When word came out that it would star Jack Nicholson and Adam Sandler, it made seem like it could be even more interesting. It was a fun concept, and it had inspiring casting with those two put together, but the filmmakers didn't take adavantage enough of the concept and seemed to let the actors picks up the pieces. What seemed like a perfect vehicle for Adam Sandler, something right up his alley, really becomes a non-Sandler film. When you expect big outbursts and zany, slapsticky comedy, you wouldn't expect Sandler to take a more subtle, low-key approach. It really becomes The Jack Nicholson Show, and Sandler is more the straight man. Sure, he gets steam off every once in a while, but it is not the Sandler performance that one would of expected. Thankfully, there is the master. Jack. Like I said before, this is his movie. He has the best lines, the best scenes, and the most fun, spirited, and interesting performance. Well, of course. He's Jack. Of anything, Sandler bogged the film down. Adam plays Dave Buzznik, an clothes designer for overweight cats(you heard me). He seems mild mannered and quiet enough, but thru some unfortunate(and highly preposterous incidents)on an airplane, Dave is sent to go to anger management classes runned by Dr. Buddy Rydell(Nicholson), who seems to paint Dave as someone with a real problem. Things go from bad to worse when Dave's sentence is pro-longed and the good doctor decides to move in with Dave and watch him more carefully. This also buts in on Dave's relationship with his lovely girlfriend, played by Marisa Tomei, who is always adorable. After some time, Dave, and you, wonder if Dr. Buddy isn't the one who's nuts. It all ends in a very ""safe"" way, and one that most can smell a mile off. What was kind of disappointing about the film is that it really didn't take advantage of the 'anger' issue. It would of been better if more anger was shown, and was shown because of everyday things that irritate all of us. Slow drivers, drivers with cell phones, talking in movie theaters, crying babies on airplanes. All of that kind of stuff. The film plays it safe and that is where it falters. Buddy's teaching technique elicits some laughs, but it's slow, and your mind sometimes wanders. This is why it would of been so good if Sandler was like himself in his other movies. Where's the jovial goofball that always acted up and had something funny to say?. That guy is rarely seen here, and it's up to the game Nicholson to carry the movie, which he does. Naturally. There were times where the movie felt forced, unnatural, and somewhat uncomfortable. The pairing of the two could of been used to so much better effect than it is here. You can also expect a handful of celebrities to cameo. People like Heather Graham, Rudy Giuliani, Harry Dean Stanton, Bobby Knight, John McEnroe, and others. Those last two you can probably guess why. It was an easy joke, but it worked. John Turturro, who previously ventured into ""SanderLand"" with ""Mr. Deeds"", also appears as a fellow member of the anger group. He's pretty funny and livens things up a bit when he is on screen. There was a lot of potential in the premise and the pairing, but the writers and director musn't of cared or noticed.",1064448000,,3332,4.658743633276741
1499935,4,B00005JM4Q,"I'm really surprised that the critics jumped all over this movie.  I think it's because the critics generally don't like Sandler movies.  They love Jack but jumped all over him for agreeing to this union. I don't enjoy Sandler's usual films for that matter, but I thoroughly enjoyed this flick all the way to the end.
With that said, I'll again reiterate: I'm NOT a typical Sandler fan and the last movie I liked with Jack Nicholson was Witches of Eastwick.  However, when I saw the previews I was intrigued from the start.  Sandler and Nicholson?  What a wild combo!  Last time I had this reaction was when Michael J. Fox was in Frighteners, which was tauted as a horror film.  Still, the curiosity was enough for me to go out and rent it.
You've probably already read the synopsis, so I'll be brief: Sandler is subjected to anger management classes, which are supervised by Nicholson's character.  His treatments are completely outrageous from the start, seemingly enraging Sandler more than pacifying his anger.  The whole film is like a sweetly wrapped present that is neatly tied up with a lovely bow at the end.  I'll leave it at that.
Sandler, who is usually a whiny, strange character in his films plays the straight role, while Nicholson goes more towards the wacky.  Still, Nicholson isn't that outrageous that you believe it's a Sandler film, but Jack does steal the spotlight.
The cameos in this film are just hysterical.  Some of which you'd probably miss if you blink but some are purposely put in tongue-in-cheek -- two of which being Bobby Knight and John McEnroe who are notorious temper-mongers in real life.  One that you'd miss: Clint Black playing a massage therapist.
This really is a fun movie.  It has humorous moments, some crude but not completely overdone, some unbelievable but they all work wonderfully.  This is also, in my opinion, not a typical Sandler film and definitely surprising with a fun and loving ending.  I highly recommend this film for those who want a good laugh.  Sandler and Nicholson fans will thoroughly enjoy this, but others will just have fun.
I give this four out of five because I always leave five for classics that I'll immediately go out and buy.  Regardless, this is more of a black comedy but still fun and worth buying or renting.",1064448000,6,2290,4.73989898989899

If you're a Sandler fan, you'll enjoy this a lot although Nicolson is the funny one here as an eccentric, Jazzy-Beatnik doctor who flips over the line drawn between genius and maniac constantly.  Its really fun to see Nicolson be this silly - ""Did you hear a frog, Buddy?""
There's also some great cameos and supporting actors. (Bobby Knight, MacEnroe, Heather Graham, Rudy Guiliani, John C. Reilly, Luiz Guzman, Woody Harrelson) but John Tuturro is the best as Sandler's highly-excitable, over-the-top ""Anger Buddy.""

It is a colossal disaster. This motion picture redefines the phrase ""a complete waste of time""; you just can't waste your time any better than you can waste it if you watch this film.
Suffice it to say that after this film is over you will want to take a part in an anger management therapy group yourself, if only to vend all the rage and anxiety this film has created in you. The primary target of the writers is to stretch the nerves of the film's viewers to the point in which they will understand how it is to totally ""lose it"".

1500051,4,B00005JM4Q,"I am sure I am not the only one who saw the trailer for ""Anger Management"" in which an apparently mild mannered Adam Sandler makes a polite request for a set of headphones from a flight attendant and is repeatedly told to ""calm down.""  The next thing we know Sandler's character, Dave Buznik, is sentenced to attend anger management seminars with Dr. Buddy Rydell, who is played by Jack Nicholson, which really makes most questions about the reasons Dave ends up in this situation pretty moot.  After all, this is a film with Adam Sandler and Jack Nicholson.  Plot seems a secondary consideration.  However, it turns out our initial queries were not as misdirected as might think, especially as it becomes clear that if anything, Buddy's problem is that he is not angry enough.
Ultimately, ""Anger Management"" is something of a disappointment.  There are some funny moments, but the funniest one comes relatively early in the proceedings and involves Dr. Buddy requiring Dave to sing ""I Feel Pretty"" from ""West Side Story.""  Dave does the accented falsetto on the lead and Buddy provides the appropriate accompaniments.  The other standout sequence involves Dave and a Buddhist monk played by John C. Reilly, who is put one of many recognizable names running around in this film.  You also have Marisa Tomei as Dave's patient girlfriend, Kevin Nealon as his attorney, Luis Guzmn and John Turturro as other members of the anger management group, and Woody Harrelson in a rather surprising little role.  Cameos begin with Bobby Knight and end with Rudolph Giuliani, Robert Merrill, Roger Clemens, and Derek Jeter.  You can also throw into the mix the uncredited performances by Reilly, Heather Graham, and Harry Dean Stanton.
You know full well why this impressive supporting cast signed up for this movie: because it had Adam Sandler and Jack Nicholson.  The mere idea of that combination has got to make you smile, and if the end result is less than satisfactory (which is certainly true), then the fault, dear Brutus, must be on the other side of the camera.  This is David Dorfman's first script, and you know he did not write it with both Adam Sandler and Jack Nicholson in mind (no rookie scribe would dare be that ambitious), so he gets a pass.  But director Peter Segel has ""Tommy Boy"" on his resume and the producers claim credit for such works as ""The Animal, ""Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo"" and ""Joe Dirt.""  Actually, it is the usually Sandler gang, which is where I think this film goes wrong.  If Adam Sandler wants to play with the big boys, which he is no doubt capable of doing, then he needed to bring in some big guns to rework the script and shot the movie.  This was a great idea for a movie, but this is not a great movie.

I think it's better than a lot of Adam Sandler films and that he's better in it than he is in a lot of his others. It's nice for a change to see him play a guy who has trouble expressing his anger. I mean usually he plays a sweet and caring guy who has a huge anger problem....here he's sweet and caring and has trouble expressing his emotions. At the end though I was disapointed that it turned into the usual Sandler film with the ""You Can Do It!"" and everyone cheering for him. I'm recommending the movie for all the laughs there  were before the weak baseball stadium scene. It's so much fun seeing Sandler and Nicholson together especially with Nicholson in excellent nutty form. The scene where Nicholson makes Sandler sing that Westside Story song ""I feel pretty"" is very funny. I know they did that in Analyze That as well but unlike in that it's actually funny here. The supporting work by Woody Harrelson, Heather Grahem and John Turturro is fun as well. Critics and some people think a Jack Nicholson and Adam Sandler movie called Anger Management could've been a lot better. I think they work great together and that the film is a lot of fun despite some weak writing. It's not great but it certainly doesn't suck.....at all.",1063929600,2,1358,4.432

1500156,4,B00005JM4Q,"Anger management should be called "" Assertiveness training"" because the man who Adam Sandler is portraying is really not angry at all but a passive man who allows everyone to be angry with him. Surprisingly the cast includes two uncredited actors: Heather Grahm ( Drugstore Cowboy,Boogie Nights,License to Drive )
as a dreamgirl--and John C.Reilly
( Gangs of New York,Chicago,Magnolia,Boogie Nights )as the grown up version of the childhood bully )of Adam Sandler's character. The cast has Academy Award Winner Jack Nicholson of ""As Good as it Gets"",""Terms of Endearment"",""Easy Rider"" --he's billed second to Sandler which is odd. Academy Award Winning actress Marisa Tomei( My Cousin Vinny,Happy Accidents )is good in this but there is no romantic or sexual chemistry between Adam Sandler & Marisa Tomei and the one 'real' kiss is proof of that--however--This is a very very funny movie filled with laugh-out-loud comedy and rewind it just to see and hear it to laugh again & laugh some more. The script is intelligently written. John Turturrow ( Quiz Show,Do the Right THing ) is hilarious as a man in anger management therapy. A cameo of Woody Harrelson ( The People Vs. Larry Flynt )as a German woman is also funny. Luiz Guzman ( Confidence,Carlitos' Way & also of the movie:""Boogie Nights""- is this movie a ""Boogie Nights""reunion ?)is solid as another candidate for therapy.
Anger Management has an excellent soundtrack of pleasant 1970's soft rock along with classic 1970's rock n'roll that is music to the ears ( pun intended ). Sandler is best known for roles in such movies as ""Big Daddy"",""Mr. Deeds"",""The Wedding Singer"". Speaking of singing- remember Adam Sandler on Saturday Night Live as ""Opera Man "" ? He is forced to sing as part of his therapy and sing he does.

1500285,5,B00005JM4Q,"They say if you go to enough movies, you'll see your own story soon enough. I won't go into detail, but this Adam Sandler/Jack Nicholson comedy is a surprisingly funny and accurate recreation of my own recent life. Adam Sandler plays David Buznik, a docile, timid sales rep. with a lack of ability to deal with confrontation. One day, while on a plane where he's sitting next to Buddy Rydell (Jack Nicholson), who seems to have a huge problem with talking during the movie. Through a huge misinterpretation of his quiet behavior on the plane, he is (mis)diagnosed as a walking Anger-machine and is sentenced to anger management classes. Ironically, Buddy Rydell is the therapist David is stuck with. Also ironically is how much more Rydell needs anger management than David does. This movie is comedy heaven, easily Sandler's (and Nicholson's) funniest film to date. Here's the most memeorable dialouge exchange between them:
Buddy:""David, there are two kinds of angry people, explosive and implosive. Explosive people show their anger relentlessly. Implosive people are like the cashier in a super market who take their punishment day by day until they finally burst out and shoot the customers in the grocery store. David, I think your'e the cashier.
David:""No,no,no, I'm the guy back in the frozen food section dailing 911.""
Boy, that Rydell is one weird guy. He's so insistant on ""curing"" David, he's moves in with him, and even insists sleeping in his bed. Here's some dialouge from that particualr scene:
Buddy:""You know David, in Europe, it's not considered unusual for 5 or 6 men to sleep in the same bed.""
David:""That's why I'm proud to be an American.""
This is a real switch for Adam Sandler. He usually plays guys who need not only to be in anger management, but to be tazered and thrown in front of a judge. Those characters never got any of those punishments, but David suffers all three in the course of this movie. In fact, after this class, he may really need anger management, since the frustration he has to deal with often causes his to have outburts at other people. One of the most hilarious scenes involves Buddy forcing David to stop his car in the middle of the Brooklyn Bridge and making him sing a childish song to cope with his ""anger"". And a running gag involves Buddy calming Daivd and other anger managees by saying ""Goosefraba, Goosefraba"" over and over.
Bottom Line, I reccomend this film to everyone, especially people actually in anger management classes or those misunderstood as agressive people. It's just a Hilarious comedy. And only those who have seen Sandler's first film ""Billy Madison"" will get the irony of how Nicholson's name is mentioned in that film, and Sandler is now doing a movie with him. Think about it.",1055721600,2,2757,4.855626326963907
1500286,3,B00005JM4Q,"Jack Nicholson is a rebel with humor and feeling, someone delightfully unpredictable.  Who can forget him with a zany grin on his face playing a writer over the edge in Stephen King's ""The Shining"" and the great Stanley Kubrick as director, when he says ""Here's Johnny!""
Nicholson, one of our greatest actors to come out of the Vietnam Era, is in hilariously outrageous form as a psychotherapist in ""Anger Management"".  He hooks up early with Adam Sandler, who promptly becomes his protege under tenuous circumstances.  A mild mannered executive secretary, overqualified and underacknowledged due to a laid back manner, he has his girlfriend, played by Adrian Ricard, constantly fretting, seeking to give him some kind of push to propel him forward in New York City's fast paced world.  Meanwhile Nicholson is determined to change his attitude and direction in life, to provide the necessary spark to give Sandler that necessary change in attitude.
Nicholson enters the scene when Sandler, through strangely escalating circumstances, is attacked by an angry flight security guard aboard a flight after a verbal altercation with a female flight attendant with ultimate legal consequences.  A New York judge places Sandler under the care of Nicholson, a psychotherapist with decidedly unconventional methods, as manifested by the many outstanding lawsuits against him.  Soon, through equally implausible circumstances, Sandler is involved in a barroom brawl.  The judge assigns Nicholson to treat patient Sandler around the clock, with the patient moving into the psychiatrist's apartment.
As the relationship develops one wonders whether Nicholson is helping Sandler or leading him to his ruination.  Nicholson keeps telling his patient that if he bears with him positive results will be obtained.  In one instance he tells his shy patient to make a move on an attractive young woman in a Boston bar by delivering a line Sandler is certain will bring a slapping rebuke.  Instead the woman invites Sandler to her waterfront apartment with wildly unpredictable results.  In another instance Nicholson suggests that his client address an old grievance as Sandler has it out with the man who bullied him when they were schoolmates.  The former bully is now a monk in a Buddhist monastery.  After the fight therapist and patient bearly escape with a monastery full of monks chasing them.
Director Peter Segal uses the right approach, giving Nicholson plenty of latitude to launch his unique pyrotechnics display.  As the script by David Dorfman continues unfolding curiosity heightens as to just what Nicholson is trying to prove.  Just as Sandler has worked up enough nerve to propose to Ricard, Nicholson appears to enter the scene.  The comedy has a mystery film finale with laughs as the story concludes in Yankee Stadium, where either Nicholson or Sandler is set to pop the question to the lovely Ricard.  Just what is happening?  Is Nicholson a heartless turncoat seeking to break his patient's heart through treachery?  Stay tuned.  The finale is fascinating, with Yankee stars Derek Jeter and Roger Clemens delivering lines, making their impact as well, along with the thousands of fans watching the unfolding romantic spectacle in the Bronx.",1054944000,2,3244,5.262135922330097

I can see how some people might be alienated. Fans of Sandler's romantic comedies such as ""The Wedding Singer"" and ""Punch Drunk Love"" might get lost in the nonsensical comedic whimsy.
Fans of Sander's earlier fantastical crazy movies such as ""Happy Gilmore"" and ""Billy Madison"" (two of my favorite cult comedies) might get bored by the attempts at romance, plot, and explanation.
Nicholson was excellent, Sandler was reasonably convincing as a pushover, low self-esteem clown, although Marissa Tomei was relegated to an extremely limited role.
Bit parts and cameos by Woody Harrelson, Rudy Juliani, Derek Jeter, Roger Clemens, John McEnroe, and Bobby Knight were well placed and entertaining.

1500404,3,B00005JM4Q,"Dave Buzick (played by Adam Sandler) creates an incident during an airline flight and gets sentenced by a judge to anger management therapy. The therapist is Buddy Rydell (Jack Nicholson), who the audience soon discovers is an egomaniac with issues of his own. There are wonderful cameos by several members of the therapy group, and Marisa Tomei is charming as Linda, Dave's long suffering girlfriend who is continually trying to improve his self esteem. We even have Rudy Guiliani and several members of the New York Yankees in crucial roles as guest stars.
This movie has some truly hilarious moments, really comedic incidents and unexpected developments to keep the theatergoer interested. The idea was quite clever, and the cast is talented enough to pull it off. But neither the script or the direction lived up to the idea's promise. It had the potential to be five stars, but only rated as high as three stars because of the truly enjoyable last half hour and the very clever and quite cute surprise ending.
Why was I so disappointed? The beginning was very contrived, and a lot of the supposedly funny situations early in the film were quite strained and unbelievable. Nicholson is superb within the limits of the script, and carries the early part of the movie with Sandler as his straight man. It also moved slowly on occasion, a serious problem for a comedy. Most disappointingly, a story with this much comic potential did not need the continued attempts at humor through sexual innuendo, crude jokes and generally off color material that occasionally was truly humorous but just as often contributed nothing of substance to the story and at times actually detracted from it. It seemed as if the scriptwriters often decided that it was easier to go for cheap laughs than make the effort to be really funny.
So, if you like the stars of this film and want to laugh without having to exert any effort having to think deeply for a few hours, you will find this film a satisfactory diversion and will leave the theater smiling and feeling good about the conclusion and the truly funny sequences that did occur. But if your expectations are high and you want to think as well as laugh, then see BEND IT LIKE BECKHAM instead.

Adam Sandler and Jack Nicholson. Sounds about as likely a pairing as Robert DeNiro and Ben Stiller...oh...wait.

Only through the curious casting of Nicholson, his grand presence and comedic know-how, does Anger Management elevate itself above most of Sandler's previous work.
The pairing of Nicholson and Sandler is quite unique given their body of work and acting styles. However, I did feel that they worked well together on screen.

1500406,3,B00005JM4Q,"Although the duo of Adam Sandler and Jack Nicholson may be one of the oddest, most intriguing duos since `Meet The Parents' gave us Stiller and De Niro, this particular comedy doesn't reveal itself as anything more than your average comedy; and your average Adam Sandler movie.  But the appearances by Nicholson and the long list of cameos and Sandler-movie regulars make it worth your time.  And money.  Overall the movie featured some hilarious bits of comedy and a few surprises, but everything else in between is nothing we haven't seen before.  In comparing Sandler's earlier work, this would probably be a combination of `Happy Gilmore' and `Mr. Deeds'.  Do with that what you will.  You probably know a little about the storyline by now, but for the amateur, here's an overview:
Adam Sandler plays the role of Dave, just your average worker.  In the previews, you saw how Sandler was put into anger management; the movie offers nothing too different.  And the way it happens (at first glance) is both ill-advised and stupid.  Once he is sentenced (that's a fitting word) to this ""group"", he gets to know the character of Dr. Buddy Rydell (Nicholson).  Rydell's abnormal and zany healing habits offer for most of the movie's brighter spots; as it seems Buddy himself could use some quote-unquote: anger management.  As I said, there is a long list of cameos and regulars that appear.  Among those featured are New York Yankee superstars Derek Jeter and Roger Clemens, John C. Reilly (`Magnolia', `The Perfect Storm'), Heather Graham, John McEnroe (who was also in `Mr. Deeds'), John Turturro, and Woody Harrelson in an appearance worth the price alone.  I won't spoil it for you.  I could've kept going with that list but it would become too long to handle; there`s many, many more.  I won't spoil those for you either.  As you can probably imagine, the plot is pretty simple.  As with many other Sandler films (though not Nicholson's), the story becomes slow and does not hold the attention of [us] as well as it should.  But before you discard the movie, know that (lord behold) Jack Nicholson saves the day.  He brings some good twists to the screen with his character and that may overshadow the fact the movie is rather basic. If you're a Nicholson fan you'll probably like this film.  On the other hand, if you're a Sandler fan you'll probably be a bit disappointed with it.  Only if you are a die-hard fan will you really love it.
Regardless of the poor script, average acting and typical humor, `Anger Management' does mange to entertain.  Everyone in the theatre was laughing and seemed to be enjoying the film.  If you pay to see this movie you will almost certainly end up laughing and remembering a few choice sequences.  But over time, the movie will probably do nothing more than be a theatrical blockbuster.  So if you want to help add to the success of a somewhat-hilarious, everyday comedy with some intriguing/well-known actors, then do see this.  But if you're looking for a movie that will change your life or persuade you to view it again, you won't find it here.  I recommend you watch this movie if you enjoy Adam Sandler and the type of comedy his movies possess.  Because if you don't, you might walk away frustrated with your head down.",1050969600,2,3268,4.74645390070922
1500407,4,B00005JM4Q,"A fundamental movie reviewing principle has emerged for me over the last few years.  If Roger Ebert pans a movie, it invariably is a good movie...  Check it out.  It actually makes Ebert a usable critic as long as you use the George Costanza approach of doing the opposite.
So what about Anger Management?  Sure enough, Ebert hated it.  And, sure enough, it's a damn funny movie with a liberal dose of intelligence and insight.  I'm not allowed to reveal spoilers here, so I'll have to keep my comments relatively vague.  Nicholson, not surprisingly, is stellar in the role of psychotherapist qua psycho.  And this isn't Nicholson dialing it in.  Maybe the restrained performance he delivered in About Schmidt triggered this therapeutically free-wheeling performance.  Whatever it is, Jack's performance is genuine and genuinely hilarious.  Some people can't stand Sandler, and I don't expect them to fall in love with him here.  But this is Sandler's most restrained and likeable performance.  He instinctively knows that he can't compete with Nicholson's craziness, it seems, so he pulls back enough to make his character a sympathetic ""everyman"" who suffers from one of society's chronic ills:  sublimated anger.  Nicholson and Sandler riff off each other in scenes that brim with spontaneity and freshness.
There nothing extraordinarily insightful about the plot line, but it talks about the modern male predicament in an interesting and wise voice.  You just need to catch the groove and roll with it.  And be prepared for a lot of it to be just plain silly and over the top.
The bottom line is that this movie is both witty and fun, and Roger Ebert dislikes it.  What more could you ask for?",1050883200,5,1697,4.957446808510638
1500408,4,B00005JM4Q,"First thing that I want to warn you about, this IS an Adam Sandler film. There is no mistaking the jokes and the supporting actors in this film and the film is truly Sandler. If you don't like Sandler films, run, because this film is not for you no matter how much you might like Jack Nicholson. That being said, it is one of the best Sandler films I have seen. Nicholson is hilarious and fits in to a Sandler comedy simply because he is a great actor. He does elevate Sandler and everyone in this film.
There are some great cameos in this film, several are very short and I can not hint at them without giving away the joke. I will say that Heather Graham was hilarious. There were great unexpected scenes that made me almost pee in my pants.
I only gave this film 4 out of 5 due to the corny and slightly predictable ending. Sandler was funny. Jack was roll-on-the-floor-choking-on-your-popcorn funny.
Warning! It is a Sandler type film don't expect sophisticated plot lines, expect potty humor.",1050883200,2,997,4.513812154696133
1500526,3,B00005JM4Q,"Both Jack Nicholson and Adam Sandler have a legion of fans: Nicholson with the over 30 and Sandler with the under 30's. So, if nothing else it was a good business decision to bring these two actors together in ""Anger Management."" Artistically, though the combination of these two actors is at times funny, this pairing Nicholson and Sandler is not an unqualified success.
""Anger Management"" is about Dave Buzznik: a mild-mannered executive assistant who, because of a series of mildly humorous circumstances, finds himself sentenced by the court to undergo Anger Management therapy administered by Buddy Rydell (Jack Nicholson).
Sandler does a good job, but this part is nothing new for him as his comedy style has always depended on him being just short of exploding into anger. The same goes for Nicholson who coasts through his role as Buddy. Marissa Tomei, looking as radiant as ever, is wasted in the girlfriend role.
If it were not for the supporting performances this movie would be a real downer:
John Turturro, Luis Guzman as Dave Buzznik's fellow therapy patients and John C. Reilly as Dave's high school nemesis, now a Monk. (!) All three bring a much needed strangeness, out of the box quirkiness to the proceedings. Qualities of which this film needs more. In fact Sandler's scene with Reilly at the Monastery is sure to go down as a Modern classic.
""Anger Management"" is not a total mess as there are definitely several scenes that work well. But Nicholson and Sandler need stronger direction and better writing to keep them on their toes and to keep us interested.",1050796800,7,1579,4.895522388059701
1500527,5,B00005JM4Q,"Man this movie was frickin' hilarious and it's worth watching for Buddy (Jack Nicholson) laughing and crying alone and Adam Sandler does a great job as the mild mannered David Buzznik and this movie has alot of cameo appearances as well.
I think that people shouldn't come down hard on this movie and all what it takes to like this movie is a good sense of humor and you people are probably expecting this to be an Oscar-worthy performance but I take it like if it's a good comedy and I also believe that this is Adam Sandler's best movie since Big Daddy.",1050710400,3,555,4.398058252427185
1500528,3,B00005JM4Q,"""Anger Management"" is a typical Adam Sandler movie. There are some great laughs here and there but I think so much more could have been done with the great cameo appearances that seemed almost too gratuitous - meaning, they tried too hard at times. To me, if you will have the cameos, do more with them - don't just stick 'em in as filler material.
Jack Nicholson does an admirable job portraying a psychotic psychologist. I do like that the end of the movie has a nice/fun twist - it made the movie tolerable.
Again, I laughed here and there but I've laughed harder. I don't regret the experience but I doubt I'll add it to my DVD collection.",1050451200,4,643,4.411764705882353
1500529,2,B00005JM4Q,"This highly unmanageable comedy is in need of management itself. With a good premise, good actors, and good marketing, you'd think the high-grossing film would be perfect. I actually felt sorry for the film it was so disappointing. Yeah, there are some funny scenes and excellent actors, but the film was...a mess. The script needed so much more work. It was badly edited, in that boring scenes were longer than the interesting and fun ones. The film itself has a personality disorder. Throughout the entire film, the story switches back and forth between humorous and stupid. Sandler himself doesn't really know what to do. He and the director tried to make ""Anger Management"" a ""Happy Gilmore"" when it's MEANT to be like ""Big Daddy"" or a film that's more developed and refined, for Sandler. What we got was an unfunny, sometimes stupid film that has more unlikable spots than likeable ones. Jack Nicholson is great, as is Sandler and a charming Marisa Tomei. The broad storyline is perfect. But the overall product is sloppy, unfunny, and unmanageable. Sorry.",1050364800,3,1061,4.966292134831461
1500530,3,B00005JM4Q,"No doubt Jack Nicholson has a blast with this part as lunatic `anger management' therapist, Buddy Rydell, who is assigned to reform mild-mannered Adam Sandler, unjustly accused of assaulting a flight attendant.  There are a lot of laughs, but they fall into one of two categories:  the really good ones, that come from the outstanding performances from Nicholson, Sandler, and a host of great actors in smaller parts and cameos; and then the merely raunchy ones.
In the first category I'd put every scene featuring John Turturro and Luis Guzman as fellow anger addicts in Sandler's group therapy class, a cameo by John C. Reilly as a Buddhist monk, another cameo by Woody Harrelson I would not spoil for you, and more.
In the second class I would put the huge number of jokes based on female p*rn stars necking with each other, on an ex-boyfriend of Sandler's girlfriend who is very.....well he's very LONG you see, on picking up girls in bars with lines about exploding pants.  That sort of thing.  I'm all for a little raunchiness if it's truly funny, but very few laughs manage to be both raunchy and funny both.
Furthermore, the ending is just plain old-fashioned silly, undermines the whole movie.  But hey go see it anyway.  As always, Nicholson is worth your money.",1050364800,3,1272,4.7853881278538815
1500531,4,B00005JM4Q,"This movie has a lot to enjoy. You get a subdued Adam Sandler who slowly loses it until he's almost ""Happy Gilmore"" again by the end. You get a psychotic-but-in-control Jack Nicholson who looks like he's slipped back into his ""Joker"" mode from Batman for a while. You get some great ""Hey, I know that guy from somewhere"" faces for the co-stars (who all turn in great performances). The only thing you miss is all the laughs you could have been given. While there are some absolutely hilarious moments (Sandler reluctantly gets into a fight with a blind guy in a bar), there are some gross-out moments that you can skip (two women kissing and doing other things throughout the movie). The language is also kind of fierce in parts, and the biggest running joke in the film is about one character's rather large body part. All in all, it has moments of brilliance that will make you laugh out loud, and then it will dip into some trash ""funny"" moment that will only to elicit a groan. There's some great cameos here, so don't take your eyes off the screen or you may miss 'em! Don't take the kids, but adults might enjoy it.",1050364800,2,1121,4.4731707317073175
1500532,3,B00005JM4Q,"Give the man some credit: Adam Sandler knows what his target audience wants to see in his movies.  ANGER MANAGEMENT certainly doesn't disappoint: it has its share of juvenile lewdness, politically incorrect humor, and flatulence jokes.  But unlike some of his Saturday Night Live peers, Sandler knows that you can only make so many [obscene] jokes in a ninety minute film.  There's usually something sweeter underneath.
In ANGER MANAGEMENT, Sandler plays mild-mannered Dave Buznik, who suddenly finds himself sentenced to anger managment class.  Directing his therapy is Dr. Buddy Rydell, played by Jack Nicholson.  The therapy becomes more difficult for Dave when he finds himself placed in Buddy's intensive anger management program, which requires the two of them to live together in the close quarters of Dave's apartment.
The screenplay hinges on the chemistry between Sandler and Nicholson, and for the most part, it works.  Sandler plays Dave as quiet and emotionally suppressed.  Buddy Rydell is portrayed by Nicholson with an intense energy that works well with the part.  While neither role is a great stretch for either actor, in the end the relationship works, and the odd pairing makes for some interesting scenes.
The ""sweeter"" part of this film is provided by the relationship between Dave and his girlfriend Linda, played by Marisa Tomei.  The film is obviously centered on Dave and Buddy, but Tomei is a welcome addition to her few scenes.
In the end, most people will either see this film because they like Sandler or not see the film because they hate Sandler.  I'm not a big Sandler fan but the pairing was too unusual to miss.  In the end, I thought it was an enjoyable comedy that has some good laughs, although some of them are definitely at the expense of political correctness.",1050278400,,1802,5.0134228187919465
1500533,3,B00005JM4Q,"There were three or four scenes in the film where I laughed deeply and freely. It was some funny stuff! I enjoyed Nicholson's performance. I even enjoyed watching Sandler from time to time. And I definitely enjoyed watching the classy and beautiful Ms. Tomei. But despite the fact that a substantial amount of humor, smarts and beauty go into the film, it is crippled due to poor casting (Sandler's performance is irritatingly uneven compared to Nicholson's) and even poorer writing (much of the story is derivative of other, greater works). As entertainment it works on a few levels: engaging characters, beautiful NYC, nice twists and turns. But in order to have been considered a complete film, its creators would have had to infuse a greater believability, a greater originality.

1500534,4,B00005JM4Q,"The plot of ANGER MANAGEMENT really isn't even worth discussing because it starts off rather simple then becomes extremely complex and convoluted. Besides, the plot takes a backseat in this movie and though most of the time it is a story that drives a film, that isn't the case here. The reason most people will be going to watch this movie (and the reason you should too) is the pairing of Jack Nicholson and Adam Sandler together in a comedy. Sandler, like he does in just about every other movie he has ever made, pretty much plays himself; the soft-spoken, mild-mannered man who is seething with a biting sarcasm and fiery anger underneath. Nicholson, on the other hand, gets to do something he hasn't been allowed to do very often in the past: he gets to use his famous maniac energy and use it full force in a comedy. The results are hilarious. Though the movie looks like a bunch of loose sketches stitched together with a few scenes added in and an ending that resembles something out of CANDID CAMERA or the movie THE GAME, those stitched-together sketches with Nicholson and Sandler are priceless. Especially funny are the scene of them singing ""I Feel Pretty"" in a stopped car on a busy New York bridge and the scene with John C. Reilly at a Buddhist monastery. Overall though the movie isn't all that great, it is more than worth the price of admission just to see Nicholson and Sandler paired off together. They should team up more often and could be the next generation of Hope and Crosby.",1050192000,,1503,4.591078066914498
1500535,3,B00005JM4Q,"Anger Management is more sad than funny. Why producers think we get pleasure out of other people's misery is beyond me. After viewing this, I need anger management.
Adam Sandler plays meek Dave Buznik (the same character he plays in ALL his films, just with a different name), a nice guy who is a walking doormat. Jack Nicholson is Dr. Buddy Rydell, a therapist assigned by a court to treat Buznik for alleged issues after he uncharacteristically lashes out at strangers a couple of times. But wait, here's the ruling comic concept: the doctor is crazier than the patient. Dr. Rydell moves in with Buznik and begins to control his life, going so far as putting moves on the younger man's girlfriend (a wonderful Marisa Tomei, bouncing back up after her horrible performance in IN THE BEDROOM).
There are a few forced laughs here and there, mostly from seeing what crazy thing Nicholson's character will do next. It gets old fast. I thought this would be better than the typical Sandler farce. I was wrong.
The best and by far most clever thing in Anger Management are cameos featuring Bobby Knight, John McEnroe, and ex-New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, as well as hilarious appearances by Woody Harrelson, Heather Graham, and John C. Reilly.
If in desperate need of a laugh, this movie isn't for you. If there is nothing else to see, go for the nothing else instead. This movie just didn't deliver, but it does have a few good moments, just too far in between.",1050192000,,1462,4.692607003891051
