6152836,5,B00HAPJ15I,I was so happy to see that Freeway is available on Amazon!  It is a wonderful guide to true freedom from that which holds one back in life.,1391990400,,139,3.9642857142857144
6152837,5,B00HAPJ15I,"The Freeway videos were the perfect complement to our Freeway guide and small group!  We just completed a small group which went through the Freeway book and have nothing but praise for Mike Foster and the very talented folks on his team.  Baring one's soul to anyone can be frightening, even more so to a group of people we know.  Mike's unique approach -- the ""not-so-perfect"" guide was almost magical.  A group of us got together and went through the videos, hearing stories of struggle, honesty, brokenness, pain and loss and learned to open up.  And by open up, I mean deep stuff.  Mike is clearly gifted in communicating volumes in these videos which are only a few minutes each, but jam-packed with truth that makes people want to take off the masks, share about struggles and pain and just find grace and love.  The videos speak of a loving God who made us, loves us incomprehensibly, and wants to meet us where we are.  One of the things I believe makes them so powerful is that they aren't a ""how to"" guide with do-this, do-that kinda stuff, but are videos of a guy who shows you the way.  He opens up and shares personal stories in a way that's transparent, raw, real and related -- and then the natural response is to just jump in and want to grow through stuff with him.  In a day where so many pastors and leaders want to appear to have everything together, Mike shares transparently about his own stuff, his own pain and how he -- like us -- is working through life just like the rest of us.  We enjoyed the videos, and we particularly enjoyed the workbook and weekly homework which was artistically created to engage the participant and not scare them away.  We are so thankful to have found Freeway and have shared the material with several friends.  I put the title ""So it's not just me?"" because Amazon asked for a title or headline, it was tough thinking of one that could really do it justice, and then remembered how the ""not-so-perfect"" guide really showed that we're all in this together.  The more we open up, the more we find that others are so much like we are, desiring to share our stories and become authentic, and wowed at how quickly we hear others say, ""Me too.""  P.S  Mike, I want your fridge!",1394064000,6,2227,4.461728395061728
6152838,5,B00HAPJ15I,"It's a difficult task to make freedom and grace tangible concepts but Mike Foster does an excellent job of accomplishing this in Freeway! We used the workbook and content to lead a church wide series where we saw record attendance, both on Sunday mornings, as well as in our small groups during the week. You can't get where you're going until you understand where you've been and Freeway gives people an opportunity to embrace their stories and let God redeem it like only He can. I can't recommend this content enough!",1393891200,,520,4.725274725274725
6152839,4,B00HAPJ15I,"It's funny because it's in the title... ""Freeway: A Not-So-Perfect-Guide to Freedom"". I started watching this with my typical over analytically accusing mind and found what I thought were imperfections. Little flibs and flubs from the author while talking to the audience. Little things like this bug me! But, while I was watching the intro Mike (the author) starting talking about his idea of beauty in the imperfections. He even mentions that he thought about spending money to have this pseudo-fake house pictured in the background. And having random people surrounding him, pretending to be his friends. All-in-all, this feels like a real conversation. None of this Hollywood over the top, fake description of what being free in Christ is all about. I place my value of the DVD on the content. And the content drives the message of hope, grace, and humility to the audience.",1393632000,5,878,5.02054794520548
6152840,5,B00HAPJ15I,"This guide to freedom helps you to discover your pain, take ownership of it and to become free from it in a friendly and fun way. I appreciate the ""realness"" of the DVD, the honesty of Mike Foster and the invitation he gives each time to be free from all of the hurt, shame or guilt that we've been holding for so long. The examples he uses for each section are simple but are helpful to break down the message and make it easy to understand so you can take action. I am so thankful for the lessons I learned and can't wait to hear the stories of others who experienced their freedom through Freeway.",1393459200,3,600,4.226086956521739
6152841,5,B00HAPJ15I,"The chasm was far too wide, I never thought Id reach the other side.  Your LOVE never fails.  With my husband Garrick, I have had the most extraordinary seven weeks in my Freeway Group.  It was been seven weeks of discovering who I am with Christ in me.  Freeway methodically leads you through a process of slowing down and taking time to look inside at the pain in our hearts that we run from.  It has been liberating and I have experienced a deeper level of healing that I didn't even know existed.  God is surely good, and His love never fails!  ~ Joanne Russell",1393286400,,565,4.3238095238095235
6152842,5,B00HAPJ15I,"The unique thing about this DVD and study is how non-threatening, even fun, it is while facilitating major life change in those who are open to it. It may not be ""deep"" in the way you might expect, but it is powerful. It gives you practical tools to use to move past those issues in your life that have been holding you back from living in the joy, peace and freedom we have when Jesus set us free.",1392854400,,398,4.115384615384615
6152843,5,B00HAPJ15I,"Freeway is a beautiful and down to earth study.  It offers tangible and real ways to walk though the mess of life and to face our fears, our pain and our deepest regrets in order to live a life of freedom and joy.  This study will encourage you to step out from behind the mask of perfection. Learn to live a life you can run towards and fully embrace!

6152844,5,B00HAPJ15I,"Freeway: A Not-So-Perfect Guide to Freedom (Group Discussion DVD).

Mike Foster has a way of communicating that is connectable. This DVD set makes you feel like you're in Mike's kitchen with him having a conversation.

The message is freeing and hopeful and beautiful.

If you want to be free, check out this DVD set, you won't be disappointed.",1392336000,2,344,4.896551724137931
6152845,5,B00HAPJ15I,"If you can relate to being human, you will find this resource incredibly valuable. It's great for groups as well as individuals.
I'm a big believer in weeding out the source of hindrance from within before attempting to move forward.
Mike Foster gives tangible ways to free yourself from those things that are (knowingly and unknowingly) holding you back.
This is a guide to doing more than surviving.
By bringing your past failures and future hopes together, this is an investment in who you are today and who you will be going forward. It's never too late to change course. The choice is yours. Start here.",1392163200,,608,4.745283018867925
6152846,5,B00HAPJ15I,"Honestly, this scared me at first. It made me ask some tough questions of myself - and it demanded answers. I couldn't just mentally agree with the content and still hide behind my excuses. i had to change. But Mike has a way of walking you through the process that is reassuring and invigorating. Get this dvd and get the workbook from their website. Then watch what happens.

HIGHLY RECOMMEND",1392163200,,394,4.628571428571429
8631376,5,B00HAPJ15I,Freeway rocked my world in a good way! I have always felt trapped by my feelings of inadequacy and this book helped me break free of that. Also the drawings and exercises that I was able to do with my small group grew us all so much closer!!,1474243200,,241,4.041666666666667
8631377,1,B00HAPJ15I,"Our group could only make it through the third study. It was just too much fluff with nothing concrete to offer anyone. Freedom and healing are found in Jesus-too bad we couldn't Him in the book. There were a few token verses along with Dr. Suess quotes and other cliche' catch phrases. Not enough to allow someone to explore with any depth. I was hoping to like this study and make personal connections with others but the ""study"" became more annoying than helpful. It makes me wonder if the author is just really good at marketing. How sad that Christianity has been reduced to this.",1459296000,3,585,4.580952380952381
8631378,1,B00HAPJ15I,"Amateur psychology at its best, a Christian devotional at its worst.  Hardly backed with relevant Scripture, it panders to the Christian crowd that has given up on learning anything new about God, and are content with receiving watered-down, Joel Osteen-esque motivational speeches in a 6-step format.",1457136000,4,301,5.543478260869565
8631379,2,B00HAPJ15I,"The study felt juvenile at times and was lacking in scriptural references. Some of the excercises seemed contrived and silly. To be a successful study, one must be very emotionally I tuned and willing to be venerable.

I was very disappointed that the book encourages conducting balloon releases at the end of the study. And if that's not bad enough, they did theirs on a beach for the example. Very ignorant. This practice is potentially damaging to Gods creation. http://www.fws.gov/news/blog/index.cfm/2015/8/5/Balloons-and-Wildlife-Please-Dont-Release-Your-Balloons",1446249600,3,569,6.1125
8631380,5,B00HAPJ15I,"Freeway was an amazing devotional! It really helped our group to become more open and honest with each other. There was accountability and honesty that was discovered in all of us. Personally, Freeway helped me to discover more of myself. The book is very interactive and is written in such a unique way that you never get bored reading! On almost every single page there was some sort of activity that made you think deeper than just surface level. The book is unlike any book that you may read or any devotional that you may go through. There is no way that you could go through this book with out discovering something new about yourself. By far the best part about this book was how each page was designed to keep you engaged and thinking differently. It is so worth buying!!",1423699200,,779,4.531914893617022
8631381,5,B00HAPJ15I,nice study I was expecting a little more scenery.,1418515200,,49,4.555555555555555

8631383,3,B00HAPJ15I,I don't know how the referral to buy this came from my sister? she said she never sent it to me. It was interesting - but dated,1406505600,,127,3.740740740740741
8631384,4,B00HAPJ15I,"This book has us talking about all the things we should talk about interpersonally. The videos are good at staging the discussion and giving context to the teaching while the book is easily laid out, easy to read and full of great information. Thanks!",1402876800,,251,4.7272727272727275
8631385,1,B00HAPJ15I,"I wanted like this book, I really did. The concept is excellent -  use a small group setting to look at past fears and failures, embrace them, and leave them behind or turn them into tools for ministry. However, by week three our small group decided we really did not like this study. We spent an entire week discussing forgiveness and there were no Bible verses. It is not that the study is unBiblical, it is simply lacking the scripture references. Without the context of Scripture the "" freedom""  is just a feeling. There needs to be more Scripture and concrete passages people can hold on to. I felt like this study was a waste of our time.",1399420800,19,644,4.4491525423728815
