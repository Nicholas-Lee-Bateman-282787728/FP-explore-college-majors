8310468,3,B001I4DIJW,"I was searching for a video that I could play in groups in my senior community.  I have a fervent desire to introduce Anthroposophy to people showing interest in the Spirit.  I am really sad to have to acknowledge what a disappointment this video was. Prematurely produced, it does not do justice at all to the profound concepts that Rudolf Steiner shared with humanity. The clarity, for one, was not good. The videographer's attempt to add figures of Arhiman and Lucifer and the sordid material world earth has become, were jumpy and at times inappropriate, taking away the meanings which some of the speakers (sometimes inaudible, or overcome by outside sounds of traffic, automobile horns, etc.). One excellent German speaker was interviewed in his office while a small fan sat right in front of his chair, a strong distraction.  It is truly admirable that Antonelli's intention must have been strong and sincere to share his appreciation of anthroposophy, even conceptualizing such a feat.  The film opened with the voice of an architect who used ""um-m-m"" so often that it took precedent over his words. Another speaker from the archives of the Goetheanum which Steiner built, enthusiastic of course, seemed almost ""flaky."" If I, on the anthroposophical path for nearly 25 years, found it difficult to listen to, how could it be shown to people beginning to show an interest...Oh, expressing frustration with this video,I am generally not one to criticize. However, obviously, I am doing so here; perhaps because I was looking forward to sharing this video with others, I am quite disappointed.  Steiner's works deserve much better! much better.",1266192000,5,1649,5.092592592592593
8310469,5,B001I4DIJW,"As the creator of this DVD, I feel that I must clarify a few things to allow those few who do not appreciate this film to see it in a new light.  But before I start, I have to mention that it has been popular amongst anthroposophists of all levels in the Windsor and Detroit area as well as people who had never been exposed to Rudolf Steiner.  It also did very well at the Calgary Film Festival and has recently been picked up by New Leaf for distribution to thousands of bookstores across the English speaking world.  It is literally flying off the shelves.

The technical quality is very high throughout, but the main criticism I hear is regarding the structure. There are images that accompany the speaker's dialogue in counterpoint, telling a story of their own and adding another layer of commentary to the main narrative thrust.  The reviewer above felt that these images were randomly inserted, however this statement is as far from the truth as it could possibly be.  The film is edited with the precision of Eisenstein and the associate flow of Alain Resnais - film directors whose works I studied closely while assembling this work.

Rudolf Steiner  has outlined a series of meditations in which the meditator creates an image in his mind and then allows it to transform into other related images.  This is a prelude to ""imaginative knowledge"".  When the meditator removes the images and is then left only with the connections between the images he ascends to what could be seen as a prelude to ""inspiration"".  It is all in the connections between the images and not the images themselves.  For this reason inspiration has been connected to music, and imagination to visual art.

So how does this relate to the film?  Well, the images tell their own story and seeing their relation to the commentary and to each other is a meditation in itself, a mirror of the step from imagination to inspiration.  These images were very carefully picked to not only reflect or illustrate what was being said, but also create their own story on a higher level of associative cognition.  In a sense they have a music of their own and a story of their own.  Finding this is an exercise and goes to the heart of Steiner's meditative techniques.

On another level, when conceiving this film I felt that it should have a structure, but one that was not rigid or dogmatic (as this would be Ahrimanic and against Steiner's views) but one that was more poetic and associative.  The images also repeat and reappear in different contexts, further compounding the meaning.  So it is like a piece of modern art, a poem by TS Eliot, or a Jazz solo.  Steiner was a very talented and original man and an approach to his philosophy requires a very unique language of image that I feel I developed and achieved in this film.  Form follows content!  While I can't make everyone appreciate this approach, I felt it was necessary when tackling such an individual as Steiner, whose works I have studied for almost 25 years.  And certainly it can't be any less ""bizarre"" in form than Steiner's own mystery dramas.  So I am surprised that a handful of Anthroposophists have had a difficulty with this formal aspect of this film.

So, for those who want a traditional documentary that spells things out in black and white this may not be for you, but for those open minded seekers on the path who love modern art, poetry, and music as much as meditation and Eurythmy, I would hope this film would dazzle you and open your eyes or I have failed in my mission to bring Rudolf Steiner to the modern world.

8310470,1,B001I4DIJW,"This movie is very disjointed and confusing.  When we first played it, we thought that there must be a mistake with the editing because the opening shows ""Grand Theft Auto III"" rather than the film's title.  Later it seems like this was actually intentional rather than a mistake even though it is a very confusing way to begin the film.  Unfortunately, most of the film is equally poorly edited and conceived.  The camera shots are shaky. There are muddy images lifted from old VHS tapes which are randomly inserted.  People new to Steiner's thought will not get a clear understanding of who he was and the nature of his work.  Those who are familiar with Steiner's work may be horrified by the sensationalistic approach taken by this documentary.  The overall quality of this production is VERY poor.  Perhaps this is the artistic goal of the director and makes sense to him, but I doubt it will make sense to anyone else.  We purchased this because of the wonderful list of people interviewed, but the impact of their comments is lost in the production.  I can't imagine that they would have agreed to participate in this film if they knew how bizarre the final product would be.  Very disappointing.",1230768000,8,1203,4.735576923076923
8310471,5,B001I4DIJW,"Finding Rudolf Steiner is a thoughtful and artistic introduction to Rudolf Steiner's spiritual philosophy.  It is finely packaged and technically flawless.  It uses interviews with five renowned anthroposophists presented in counterpoint with images culled from Eurythmy sessions and the Goetheanum, as well as archival footage and even images from video games and life on the streets in Buenos Aires.  The film guides us through the basics of anthroposophy starting from Lucifer and Ahriman, the Cosmic Christ, Reincarnation and Karma, and mediatation, but always reminding us how much our western culture has sank into the Ahrimanic element.  So I guess this is why it is called ""Finding Rudolf Steiner"" as it seems to start from the premise that the modern world is going awry and asks us where we can find Rudolf Steiner and all that he gave to us in this extremely materialistic world, a full 80 years after his death.  It is quite dense with intoned meaning, yet easy to watch with a good soundtrack.  The images often repeat at different points in the movie with slightly different figurative meanings.  The director leaves us to piece together the entire montage and see for ourselves who Rudolf Steiner was and how he might help us find the spirit in the modern world.  I also checked Antonelli's credentials.  Apparently he studied for many years with Ernst Katz, who is know to have brought Anthroposophy to America, so I assume he knows his stuff, although he has a soft touch and never asserts anything - a truly anthroposophical approach!  Kudos!",1224892800,9,1560,5.011627906976744
