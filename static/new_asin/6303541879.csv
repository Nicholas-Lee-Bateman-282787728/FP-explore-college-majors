7849778,4,6303541879,"I love this video.  It has two Pochacco cartoons on it and two Keroppi cartoons.  If you've ever wondered what Pochacco and Keroppi's voices sound like, here's your chance. As the previous reviewer mentioned, this video is  very soothing.  I often watch it to fall asleep at night and it NEVER  fails. One funny thing about this video is all the silly mistakes in it.  There's one scene where, in the space of two minutes, the same body of  water is referred to as a lake, a pond, and a river.  Also, there's a part  where Pochacco is sitting on a swing, and the thickness of the branch keeps  changing, as well as the number of swings! Pochacco's voice couldn't be  cuter, though, and his laugh will crack you up.  The humor is quite  Japanese, as is one of the stories, in which Pokopon, a bear who plays  drums on his stomach, has his belly button stolen by the Cloud People!  I  found this obscure, but overall the video is really VERY charming.",947030400,,949,4.398843930635838
