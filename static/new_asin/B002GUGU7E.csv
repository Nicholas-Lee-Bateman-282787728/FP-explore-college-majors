8370034,5,B002GUGU7E,This is the most powerful and intense documentary I have ever seen about Titanic.  I was amazed and awed at the scientific research that takes place.  Roy Cullimore gives the Titanic personification that blows my mind.  The Lady of the Deep brings the entire program to a close beautifully.,1375056000,,290,4.877551020408164
8370035,3,B002GUGU7E,"This documentary, from 1997, is narrated by Martin Sheen.  In my view, that's a plus.  Moreover, the research aspects of the dvd are from a French perspective.  That makes it different from the American or Russian views.  Still, this disk has to be regarded as dated and lacking the latest scientifice analyses.  In comparison to the NatGeo production, ""Titanic's Achilles Heel,"" for example, this disk has been superseded.  Moreover, it lacks subtitles and time indicators.  It claims to run 50 minutes, which I believe is the minimum.  But there was no way for me to check that as the dvd ran.  There is a scene index, but again, no time remaining advice. If available at a moderate price, I'd advise people to buy this dvd in the secondary market as it seems to be out-of-print.  But there are newer ones that are far better.",1361404800,,828,4.6875
