8669880,1,B00M2MTDX4,Just got the product and the movies it has on it is not the same movies that are in the description,1486944000,,99,3.761904761904762
8669881,4,B00M2MTDX4,"The illustration/image on the key case cover is, as usual, ho humm, a come-on that is meant to attract the suckers.  However, so far the contents contained therein are for the most part what I had hoped they would  be.  They are primarily the silly, pretentious, incredibly ghastly, boring, dull, vapid, banal, and insipid creations of the Japanese (horribly dubbed) and American (GASP! ) ""film""industries This is precisely the kind of  trash that I find totally relaxing in the late evening after a hard day is gone and I am too tired for intellectual activity, yet not exhausted enough to sleep.  Even in my wasted state I find myself saying ""Oh my Gawd!  Did that really happen?""
I have only viewed the lustful and delicious cover and about 4 of the videos in the set.  However, I look forward to many late evenings of mindless (and mind emptying) relief from non-reality provided by these videos.  I fear that soon the supplies of these 30's to 90's dreadful creations will expire leaving me with only two choices:  Either do the reruns, or go to sleep!",1430870400,2,1057,4.701086956521739
8669882,2,B00M2MTDX4,Good price but had absolutely no movies on it as advertised. I bought this strictly for killjoy and killjoy 2. Was excited because it was a great price and id get both killjoy movies. It arrived and i was gravely disappointed that it didn't have any killjoy let alone any other movie as advertised on here. It seems to be a good collection tho.,1427328000,,344,4.390625
8669883,5,B00M2MTDX4,I love getting 9 movies collections for great prices. THIS item arrived on time. I would recommend this buyer.,1422921600,,110,4.842105263157895
