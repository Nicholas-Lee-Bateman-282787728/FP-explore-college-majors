8586036,5,B004FLMTJK,"This is a terrific video that combines beautiful outdoor segments that I would call grand nature photography, and very well done music matched to each video segment. It's got majestic mountains and waterfalls, scenes of peaceful countryside and seashores. I've watched the video several times since I bought it, and I see and hear new details each time I play it. A lot of skill and talent went in to making this. I am pleased with the purchase.",1295913600,,445,4.717948717948718
