2377830,1,B000A7M4UW,"Wow, I thought there was a few good logging scenes in this movie other than that it's just very cheesy.  I don't know if I can handle watching it again to understand what the other reviewers saw in it.?(I don't think so, for now.. Maybe let some friends watch and suffer through it, first.)  Definately a very cheaply, inexpensively made movie as it clearly states on the back cover; a great film for ""bad movie"" lovers? That says it all! I don't think it was no curse of Bigfoot, but a curse on anyone who can stand to sit and watch it....lol!!!! I should have gotten paid to buy and watch it.........",1195603200,,602,4.366071428571429
2377831,5,B000A7M4UW,"I appreciated how polite and pleasant the people were to each other, and how natural and sincere they all seemed in acting their various roles.  It was an interesting and exciting movie, too.  I liked the beautiful nature scenes and the vivid coloring of the images.  It was a great movie, overall.",1164672000,4,298,4.6923076923076925
2377832,5,B000A7M4UW,"If you like a movie that is fun to laugh at because it tries to be so serious then you will love this. Why MST3K never did this is beyond me. It ranks among ""The Creeping Terror"", Shriek of the Mutilated"", ""Children Shouldn't Play With Dead Things"", ""Attack Of The Killer Tomatoes"", Etc. Grab a bunch of friends and prepare for a re-discovered treasure.",1126742400,6,353,4.53125
2377922,1,B000A7M4UW,"""Curse of Bigfoot"" is a hilariously awful turkey movie from 1976. Weirdly, a large part of it consists of an amateur horror flick made already in 1958. The original film wasn't independently released until the 1990's, when it was titled ""Teenagers battle the Thing"". Are you following? Probably not, LOL.

The plot of ""Curse of Bigfoot"" starts in 1976, when a high school teacher, after showing his class an awful horror movie about Bigfoot, invites a crazed scientist to lecture about real monsters. The mad scholar tells the class about an archaeological expedition twenty years earlier that went dangerously wrong. Then follows the above mentioned 1958 film as a kind of flashback. The expedition, most of which consist of teenagers, finds a mysterious Indian mummy that (surprise) turns out to be a hibernating squatch.

The monster escapes and starts attacking people, including the town sheriff, before the brave teens soak it in gasoline. The poor Bigfoot (supposedly hundreds of thousands of years old) burns to ashes in a dramatic finale, probably the only action-packed moment in this entire production. There the story ends, with the heroes looking just fine. However, from the crazy lecturer we learn that two of them actually ended up in a mental institution...

Apparently, the high school students who made the original 1958 film had great fun doing it, but to me and many others, this is unfortunately a C-movie of truly major proportions. Only one star for King Tut's mummified monster!",1379203200,2,1503,5.1016260162601625
2377923,5,B000A7M4UW,"No, they don't show this one on late-night TV anymore, and it's a crying shame. If you can track a copy of this one down, buy it! Rent it! No Bigfoot film enthusiast should miss this. It's better than ""Night of the Demon.""  And that's not saying much!

A group of students goes on an archaeology dig with their professor.  They stumble upon an ancient burial cave and accidentally unleash a creature that has been sleeping there for centuries.  Is it a mummy? An ape-man?  No one is sure, but it's hairy, it's ugly, and it wanders around attacking people.  Guys...I think we have a monster on the loose.

One of the very worst of all the Bigfoot films, this one is a lot of fun--if it's your kind of thing. It was, as noted elsewhere, actually filmed in two sections (the main story, and then supplemental footage to pad the film out). The productions were separated by ten years or so, and this film is unique in that it features one main character who appears younger in the 60's footage, and older in the 70's footage. No aging makeup was necessary! The actor aged all by himself!

The Bigfoot costume appears to be made out of hair with a certain amount of twigs, nuts, and berries mixed in--it kind of resembles a heap of leaves someone has raked into a pile. Observe the ingenuity at work when the Bigfoot is set on fire--someone stuffed the suit full of newspapers or something, stuck it on a stake hammered into the ground, and attached wires to the arms, so that they could wave the arms about as the creature catches fire. And I'm sure they squirted a whole can of lighter fluid on the thing before they lit it, because it really flares up nicely. It appears to be smiling as it falls apart. Forget CG effects; trust me, this is cooler than anything!

One of my favorite scenes has the kids having a LONG discussion about how much change everyone gets back after bottles of soda, referred to as `pop,' are bought. It's all in the details--in this case, the profuse and unnecessary details. If you like movies as bad as you can get them, this one is for you.",1335830400,,2067,4.418421052631579
2377924,1,B000A7M4UW,"The movies are good, but the DVD transfer is of poor quality. The movies are good for a halloween party or just a good fright nightr with some popcorn.",1282521600,5,151,4.241379310344827
2377925,4,B000A7M4UW,"""The Curse of Bigfoot"" is a dream come true for those who love truly bottom of the barrel cinematic cheese. This film rivals any Ed Wood picture at being sincere but inept. It's really two films in one, and the end result tells the story of some students and teachers that go hiking on an archeological expedition and in the process uncover a cave where a bigfoot mummy has been preserved for hundreds of thousands of years. They explain that it was kept in a perpetual hibernation of some sort by being sealed in the cave with pots of burning wood and resin. (Seems credible enough, no?) Of course they take the mummy back to camp, it returns to life, runs amok, and they must right their wrong. The final scene with the buckets of gasoline and flares reminded me thematically of Ed Wood having poor old Bela Lugosi struggle with a rubber octopus because he ""tampered in God's domain.""

This movie is phenomenally bad, but laughably so, as the cast and crew were obviously very earnest if not especially talented. The Bigfoot costume itself harks back to the carpet monster in ""The Creeping Terror"" as it resembles a throw rug with eye holes and fangs thrown over a suffering stuntman more than a scary creature from eons ago. The cast spends an unbelievable proportion of the movie simply walking around in the woods while totally inappropriate bits and pieces of orchestral music is played. The entire introduction and scholastic angle fails completely, as does the monster angle which is actually told in flashback. The color balance and saturation are beyond bad (unless you like everything to range from pink to orange), as are the acting and dialogue. I was especially amused by the extremely proper dog-rebuking scene early in the film. You'll see what I mean.

This would have made an excellent episode of ""Mystery Science Theater 3000,"" and aficionados of MST3K should love this movie. It's served with a helping of some pretty amusing trailers, including the camp extravaganza ""First Spaceship on Venus."" I highly recommend this for lovers of simply horrible movies.",1272931200,5,2077,4.847887323943662
2377926,1,B000A7M4UW,"This is one of the worst movies, Ive ever seen and blew my money on. The costume is retarded and acting sucks. I mean damn, didn't they see the Roger Patterson film. The big-foot in this film looks like a cross between a gorilla/vampire with bad acne. I'm warning you,it's not worth your time and money.",1265414400,,303,4.428571428571429
2377927,4,B000A7M4UW,"This review pertains to the PR Studios DVD of this film. (And by the way, it's in the DVD-R format, not a pressed DVD).  As for the film itself, feel free to read the other reviews of this film and TEENAGERS BATTLE THE THING here and on imdb. Having read the poor reviews of the Alpha DVD of CURSE OF BIGFOOT, I opted for this higher priced PR Studios copy. I'm glad I did. I've never seen this film look good, but at least this copy looks better than I've ever seen it before. This is not to say it looks great; it doesn't. But at least it's colorful, and you can make out most of the darker scenes, which has not been true with other copies I've seen. Remember how Super-8 color-reversal home movies looked: not the greatest clarity, but really contrasty saturated color? That's kind of how this copy looks.  The sound gets a bit warble-y in the last few seconds, and the last few notes of music are missing, but other than that, this is the copy to get. What really tips it in is that you also get a great collection of really good-looking trailers too, including, amongst others, ATTACK OF THE 50 FT. WOMAN, THE 5000 FINGERS OF DR. T., BRIDE OF THE GORILLA and CONQUEST OF SPACE.",1255392000,5,1183,4.300448430493273
2377928,2,B000A7M4UW,"This review is for the Alpha dvd edition which pairs ""Curse of Bigfoot"" and ""Cathy's Curse"". I purchased this for my cult favorite ""Curse of Bigfoot"".
The transfer for ""Curse of Bigfoot"" is absolutely horrendous, obviously having been transferred from a videotape in far worse condition than my old ""Goodtimes"" EP-speed vhs tape, which almost looks vibrant by comparison.
The picture in this Alpha edition is washed-out, with the features of the characters' faces in medium-range shots even rendered practically without distinction.

Yes, ""Curse of Bigfoot"" may be a ""bad"" movie, but Alpha's poorly executed, incompetent edition makes the picture completely intolerable. Even campy movies deserve better treatment.
If one wishes to experience this movie for the first time, pass on this and go for an old videotape instead.
Perhaps other readers can comment on the quality of the PR Studios edition currently on sale here.",1233705600,12,922,5.315068493150685
2377929,4,B000A7M4UW,"I liked this movie because of it's sheer cheap weirdness. It seems to have been filmed at 2 separate times, the 1950s and the 1970s! The bigfoot monster looks more like a moldy rug! Buy this only if you like campy cheesy monster movies! A hoot!",1222041600,2,244,4.326086956521739
2377930,3,B000A7M4UW,"I bought this with the intention of going down memory lane. What a blast. I shut off all the lights and prepared myself for a night of chills. I remember when I was around seven one of the networks aired this on a Saturday afternoon in Queens. I also recall how it scared the crap out of me. Now, all it did was make me chuckle. It's probably the worst of all the bigfoot movies out there but it was long overdue to come out on DVD.

Don't expect a crisp transfer. The quality is only slightly better than a VHS tape and definitely lower in grade than a laserdisc. However, it's the best you'll ever see of this movie and we should be thankful that the film survived at all. The sound is decent as well.

I think Amazon is overcharging for this DVD which cost me nearly $20 including shipping and NYS tax. Normally, I wouldn't have laid down the cash for a flick such as this, but this movie has sentimental value for me and how can one put a price on that?",1219881600,8,957,4.139784946236559
2377931,5,B000A7M4UW,"I love this movie! Back in the 1970s they would show it on WOR all the time. Why is this movie great? 1)incredibly cheap budget 2)the monster looks nothing like bigfoot 3)wild claims by the teacher that one student was so shocked by her encounter that she can only stare into space at a psych ward (meanwhile she seems fine after said encounter)4) this is really 2 movies grafted together, separated in time by about 18 years 5) one of the teachers on the expedition is act as a know-it-all, appraising ordinary twigs and branches and claiming they're ""prayer-sticks"" thousands of years old (yeah,....right) 6) the incredulous classroom laughter when a student jokes that ""when a griffin got you, all that was left were your shoes!""I could go on, but if you like inept, if you like Ed Wood-like stuff, you'll love this odd gem!",1217721600,8,827,4.710344827586207
8075638,1,B000A7M4UW,"The Made-For-TV movie, CURSE OF BIGFOOT (1975) opens w/ booming voice-over narration, telling us the vicious history of the title creature. Eons later, modern man has built modern housing in modern suburbs. We are introduced to the histrionic high school teacher, who tells his students the more recent tales of the ""bigfoot monster"", sightings thereof, and the loss of its habitat. This is mostly done through more, seemingly endless narration. All while groove-tastic, Made-For-TV music blares. A yeti is spotted, or a giant, lint-covered sausage. We must decide. Two men roam through the woods, stopping every two seconds to look bemused. Dear Lord! They are attacked! Death happens. Back in the classroom, the psychotically melodramatic teacher brings in a Sasquatch ""expert"", named Dr. Roger Mason. This man is serious about the subject! How serious? He appears to be on the verge of ignition through spontaneous combustion at any / every second! He goes into an unhinged rant -even more narration- about a group of students, led by their teacher, Dr. Bill Wyman (Bill Simonsen), on an expedition into the wilderness. There, these brave adventurers had an encounter w/ the aforementioned sausage. This is their story. On an archaeological dig, these students, along w/ their loquacious teacher, have no idea of the terror to come! But first, it's time for lunch! Then, a great deal more chattering. In search of artifacts, our heroes climb a mountain, for about fifteen minutes of film time! We... feel... e-v-e-r-y... step! Artifact found, they spend another epoch deciding what to do w/ it! A hole is discovered. What mysteries might it contain? What else? A bigfoot mummy is stumbled upon, or a mannequin in plaster. We must choose. Naturally, the students and their blathering teacher hall the mummy back home in their pickup truck, so it can be stored in the shed, like any priceless find. What's next? Another yak-a-thon, that's what! Great heavenly days! The shed mummy has awakened, or a sentient mattress has been turned inside out. We may never know which. It lumbers forth, like any sausage-y mattress, causing limited mayhem! The sheriff arrives, and he and the students spend what feels like several lifetimes, wandering through orange groves. Centuries pass, until a finale drags into view. Whew! This is true pain! In the annals of mind-obliterating infra-schlock, CURSE OF BIGFOOT is spoken of only in hushed tones. If boredom were an ice pick, this movie would easily cause a meatball lobotomy in any wretched soul unlucky enough to witness it! We are the damned...",1507334400,,2587,5.118203309692672
8075639,3,B000A7M4UW,"It's not a bad movie, but it sure ain't a good one, either. Aside from the fact as to whether or not it was supposed to be a documentary, or someone's mind on drugs since they couldn't decide what they wanted this to be, there wasn't a whole lot in this movie that made much sense. I grew up in the 60s and 70s, but I sure don't recall having classes that taught us about Bigfoots and Yeti, or made it part of any curriculum to study about the reality of mythical monsters. Gee, what kind of teachers would lead a bunch of ill-equipped students climbing up a steep cliff without fear of someone falling and getting killed?  And what was up with teacher Roger talking about how the girls had all ended up in mental institutions, not being able to talk after what had happened? Huh? Did they see a different movie than what we did? When he said that, I said to myself, Wow, this might be good, after all, something really horrific must have happened to everyone else. Maybe what he meant to say, was that they all went crazy after seeing that ridiculous ""monster"" with the silly Halloween mask and the gum ball eyes, which made them fall over laughing so hard, they couldn't stop. Seriously, I don't think this movie knew what it wanted to be, I know I sure couldn't figure that out either, someone should have told the writers that it was extremely boring watching endless moments of actors walking through the woods, or climbing up mountains, doing nothing.  I gave this movie 3 stars because it did keep me laughing, although I don't think that was the intention of the producers. Besides, I felt sorry for the actors, who were much better than the script.",1506816000,,1657,4.465346534653466

Seriously though, this movie is something that transcends indescribable. I often times couldn't figure out whether I was watching a 70's nature documentary, a cheap mummy movie, or a strange Bigfoot film. Imagine my surprise when I realized that I was, in fact, watching all three! This weird movie is a mishmash of several movies and it was clear that no one involved had any idea what they were doing or why they should care. Luckily for us, the viewers, we get to witness it all! This movie isn't even remotely good in any real, tangible sense, but if terrible, MST3K worthy movies are your bread and butter, then you have hit the jackpot, my friend!
