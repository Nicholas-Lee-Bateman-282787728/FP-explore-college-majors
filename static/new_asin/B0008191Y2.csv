2256299,4,B0008191Y2,"Fuu, Mugen, and Jin... we meet again. This time around the gang is in for some revalations of sorts. You find out a bit about Mugen's Past in the first 2 episodes and a little more about Fuu's facination with the ""samurai who smells of sun flowers"". I'd have to say my favorite of the 4 has got to be ""Bogus Booty"". The gang comes into some money and while Fuu stuffs her face (typical for her since all she seems to do is eat and complain), the guys decide to hit the local red light district. You can imagine the sort of things they get into. I won't give away any details, except that it involves a couple of nice fight sequences. I gave it a 4 out of 5 only because its not the best of the series but its not the worst either. If you have liked the first 3 dvd's u love this one too.",1122422400,6,787,3.9559748427672954

8055213,4,B0008191Y2,Not a big fan of episodes 13 and 14. Bogus Booty is one of my favorites. Great laughs. This volume is all Mugen.,1473292800,,112,3.9130434782608696

8055215,3,B0008191Y2,"If you've seen Cowboy Beebop, you'll be disappointed by this series.  The characters are more caricatural and aren't as well developed in Beebop.  Also, the supporting characters aren't as interesting.",1171238400,,201,5.666666666666667
8055216,5,B0008191Y2,"I completely disagree with the previous Reviewer.  Episode 15 is my favorite episode of Champloo.  It's an entirely comedic episode that has an interesting theme and an amazing soundtrack to it.  The episodes in this volume are great and I'd highly reccomend them.  Then again, you cannot just pick up this volume and expect to get a full glimpse of what Champloo is, you need the whole deal. But this is a great volume nonetheless! 5 Stars.",1146528000,3,441,4.688311688311688
8055217,1,B0008191Y2,"I'm giving this dvd a 1 star not because all three episodes are crappy but because 15 is such a let down. Don't get me wrong, 13 and 14 are a must see but in 15 way too much is changed within the personalities of the charachcters it just seems like there are totally different writers this time. Episode 16 isn't quite as bad as 15  but you can tell the story has been greatly thinned out compared to  the first 14 episodes.",1145836800,,424,4.096385542168675
8055218,5,B0008191Y2,The best tv on dvd ever! - Samurai Champloo & Kung Faux are good to go! - So act like you know! - Osu!,1143331200,,102,3.2916666666666665
8055219,5,B0008191Y2,"samurai champloo has done it again! with this fourth dvd, they have made up for the 12th episode and then some! SC has introduced four more masterpieces with this dvd. below are my ratings for the episodes on this dvd.

episode 13 & 14: misguided miscreants parts one and two- mugen jin and fuu happen accross the islands where mugen grew up. episodes thirteen and fourteen reveal a lot of mugen's past, plus give us some hardcore action!

i rate episodes thirteen and fourteen 8/10

episode fifteen: bogus booty- awesome episode! mugen and jin are off to get some booty! mugen by rotten luck gets a undercover cop that no longer needs to be undercover. which means mugen no longer has some willing booty. this has got to be the most hilarious episode i have ever seen!

i rate this episode 10/10, and it is worth every star.

episode sixteen: lullabies of the lost verse 1- this episode digs some of jin's past up and is quite action-packed. jin, mugen and fuu also end up parting ways, but will fate bring them together again? one thing though, this dvd only has part one, so prepare to be cliffhung! i rate this episode 10/10

that ends this review. as always, check out my review for the next samurai champloo dvd, and the other ones before this one.

i hope this reveiw helped.

8055220,5,B0008191Y2,"This is an excellent anime.  It is action-packed and loaded with comedy.  It is also a story, which grabs your total attention and never lets go.  I highly reccomend Samurai Champloo to any die hard anime fan, or as a good anime for beginners.",1127952000,,243,4.4772727272727275
