8117466,4,B000F4TMGE,"I spoke to the late director Bob Clarke about SHE MAN just before he died in that fatal car wreck with his son. He hemmed and hawed and then said, ""I would rather not say!"" The film is nothing to be ashamed about it. It's a highly engaging no-budget regional rarity that tackles daring themes such as transvestism, gender identity ands role-playing, not once crossing into tastelessness. THE SINS OF RACHEL is a hoot - a terrible soap opera that tries to be sophisticated and falls just flat. Nifty anti-clerical ending, however.",1201132800,20,529,4.760869565217392
