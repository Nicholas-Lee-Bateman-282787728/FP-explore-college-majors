8177385,5,B000NDP6IU,Great movie. Great directorship.  Mason and Bennett are great.  Loved the excellent real life 'interruptions'  and 'pauses' the director commanded in the movie,1507852800,,159,5.826086956521739
8177386,1,B000NDP6IU,"I saw this film on t.v. and loved it. Ordered it from Amazon and found it was for ""Region 2"" (NOT the USA) and wouldn't play on my DVD player. It says All Regions on some of the info but not on other areas, where it says ""Region 2"" I didn't notice these until now and never understood it until now, but you'd think Amazon would be a bit more forthcoming about this. I misplaced my receipt, so I guess I just get to eat this. Not happy!",1500163200,,435,3.9545454545454546
8177387,5,B000NDP6IU,"My introduction to Max Ophuls as a director. And to Joan Bennett as other than the femme fatale.

In this film Joan Bennett plays the part of Lucia Harper, an exemplary upper middle class mother, capable if somewhat cool and brusque, who finds herself thrust into an almost impossible situation following the accidental death of her daughter's boyfriend of whom she vehemently disapproves. Lucia exists as a single mother much of the time due to her husband's job which involves travel. She makes a lovely, ordered home with her kindly salt of a father-in-law (Henry O'Neill), high-spirited son (David Bair), and rebellious, angsty, arty teenage daughter Bea (Geraldine Page.)

One surreptitious meeting, one reckless moment, and Mrs. Harper's quiet, organized life is thrown into turmoil. Enter blackmailer Martin Donnelly (James Mason) with the goods to force her family into scandal, or worse, land her daughter in jail on suspicion of murder. Cool, calm, collected at first, Joan Bennett's character clings to her dignity while running the household for her unsuspecting family - with the able help of her maid Sybil (Frances E. Williams) shamefully uncredited for a solid supporting role. Lucia heaps the entire weight of secret upon herself while keeping one well-heeled step ahead of disaster. Ultimately this proves too much and she spirals into a desperate panic.

Martin finds himself drawn into Lucia's life as he meets with her to collect for his boss Ted Darby (Sheppard Strudwick). As Donnelly observes Lucia he realizes they are both a sort of prisoner of fate. Neither can ever live a life outside of the confines of what is expected of them. Both are caught in situations they can't abandon, with no possible extrication of either's duty. What begins as an admiration for Lucy's integrity grows into something deeper for Martin. Something that could be life-changing.

And the film's moving climax dares suggest that even out of bitterest circumstance, a type of redemption might be found.",1497484800,,2006,5.163076923076923
8177388,5,B000NDP6IU,"This is my favorite film noir and also my favorite Joan Bennett movie (I collect them from TCM).  Comparing this with my other Bennett favorites like ""Man Hunt"", ""The Woman in the Window"", ""Scarlett Street"" and ""The Woman on the Beach"", TRM is far superior.
To be honest, I was pretty disappointed with Fritz Lang's ""Secret beyond the Door"", somehow I expected more.

The plot has been described often enough, so I rather mention that the story is based on a novel by Elizabeth Sanxay Holding which was published in LADIES HOME JOURNAL first, before it was published as a book.

The novel takes place in Long Island, NY, but having watched the movie first (and then read the novel) I find the Balboa location much more intriguing. Ever since I watched this movie for the first time, I was trying to find that house in which Lucia Harper's family lives in the movie on Google Earth/Satellite, but so far no luck.
Somebody said it's on Harbor Island near Balboa Island.

I also like the Sybill character, Lucia's kind and very helpful house keeper.

Bonus: an excellent review by Todd Haynes.",1469232000,,1090,4.68586387434555

8177390,5,B000NDP6IU,"When is Joan Bennett thought of as an actress.... if Bennett is remembered at all.  Besides being absolutely beautiful?  Oh a long time ago in the 1940's Joan Bennett helped to define film nior in some nasty films.  She could femme fatale as the mood might strike.  But as an actress she is amazing in this film.  The camera moves in a way that is close to human time, well Bennett moves along in a way that is as if I were there, and I want to run away ,,, or yell stop, Please.  The film doesn't stop and neither does the plot, the black maid or Bennett.  Everything is moving in a different time at the same time.  The camera somehow keeps up with the emotion and the various movements as they play before, beside, with, or behind the Bennett character.  All in unique and different time.  As viewers. we must go along with what we are given. Helpless to interfere and no time to think of an alternative.  Max Ophuls as the director had a way to move the camera, or the point of view, so as we were  flying with the characters.  Bennett was a lady in real life?  Married to Walter Wanger who also produced this delicious film for his wife, Joan Bennett.  Google them both.  Beautiful people.  By 1951 Bennett's  career was in ruins as her husband suspecting Bennett's agent was having an affair with his wife shot the agent, went to jail for a few month's the agent recovered.  Bennett did not.  She couldn't find

 work for years.  Bennett remained married to Wanger to his death in 1965.  Joan Bennett.  Look her up and view her movie work.  An artist

This film haunts me.  Have never observed anxiety and panic in plot and portrayals.  One has to observe and being helpless we go along with the plot as given and we all have reckless moments.  Bennette does this in a way that takes the viewer in to her being.  The stars and the way of life as portrayed in this film are long gone.  The passion as the characters follow along a terrible road.  Her beauty never gets in the way.  It is her beauty that holds  the viewer to the end.

8177391,5,B000NDP6IU,An unusual story with a pace that moves quickly.  By the end it all comes together where it started.  Well written and acted. Catches you from the beginning.,1439683200,,157,4.571428571428571
8177392,5,B000NDP6IU,"Excellent quality, has become one of my favorite of his early movies.  The dvd commentary was very interesting too which can't always be said for other movies",1431993600,,158,4.851851851851852
8177393,5,B000NDP6IU,"Re-made withTilda Swinto to great effect, but this version is better. Joan Bennett is cool and collected, waiting for the moment when to explode, and James Mason could not be stranger here. Brilliant camera work, rich B&W and eerie scenes on the ocean and especially in Bennetts's  house, which has the look finally of a morgue.

Bennett and Mason are fabulous..don't miss this one.",1413849600,,382,4.953125
