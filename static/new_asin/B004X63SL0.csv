4492277,4,B004X63SL0,"Decades before Martin Scorsese's superb adaptation of Edith Wharton's Pulitzer prize-winning novel, Hollywood tried during its Golden Age to translate the definitive novel of Old New York onto the screen. Although this was thought to be lost for quite a while, this well-produced 1934 version is finally available on DVD. The sets and costumes are much better than you might have imagined, although the production is decidedly stagey, and several of the performances are fairly disappointing. John Boles and Julie Haydon are melodramatic as Newland Archer and his bride, May Welland, and Helen Westley cackles far too much as Mrs. Manson Mingott. The best reason to see this (other than for its oddity as another adaptation of the Wharton novel, and a more faithful one than you'd have thought likely) is Irene Dunne's glowing portrayal of the Countess Olenska. A criminally underrated actor, Dunne was excellent at both drama and comedy during the 30s (and was very popular in musicals to boot, although her soprano trilling is often hard for audiences today to take). Hampered only by a kind of innate primness, Dunne found in this great Wharton character her ideal part, and she's genuinely quite moving in several of her scenes. Although best loved today for her superlative work in screwball comedies (such as THE AWFUL TRUTH and THEODORA GOES WILD), Dunne always wanted to be remembered for her dramatic work, and idealized Katharine Hepburn's performances in the 30s; this film shows her to be fully Hepburn's dramatic peer.",1305504000,31,1531,5.128

8446235,4,B004X63SL0,"Wow, it seemed to me that after watching the Scorsese version nothing would compare, but this old faithful sure riveted me.  Irene Dunne is wonderful and John Boles is so much more manly than Daniel-Lewis, he does the character tribute.",1506902400,2,236,4.9

8446242,5,B004X63SL0,I rec'd this order in yesterday's mail and I watched it last night.  Usually I prefer the older movies to the more recent but in the case of this one I prefer the newer movie from the 1990's.  Both are very good though and I am glad to have both in my library,1391558400,2,259,3.8679245283018866
