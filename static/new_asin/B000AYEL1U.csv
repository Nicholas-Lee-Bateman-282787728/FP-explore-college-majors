2397064,3,B000AYEL1U,"I saw this movie twice, and the first time around it seemed like a good pick. Once I saw it a second time I was needless to say bored. What I'm saying is that it's not a movie for the martial artist. It has horrible acting, and could not be more 80's. I suggest that you skip this movie, and go onto seeing either fist of legend ""jet li"" or, kickoxer 2 ""sasha ?"" I hope that I was of some help. Thanks...",982540800,,404,3.8795180722891565

8080484,4,B000AYEL1U,"Of the dozens of movies produced by our dearly departed Cannon Films, few are as woefully underrated as the first starring vehicle of real-life Chuck Norris disciple John Barrett. In a way, I can understand it: the title ""kickboxing drama"" doesn't really draw in a definite crowd, seeing as the few times that those two labels have clashed in the past haven't exactly been memorable. It is risky, after all, to try and sell an intelligent storyline and character development in a film where the main attraction is the martial arts, but rest assured, this little treasure manages at least twice as well as any other US-made film of its kind that I've seen. The fact that the drama portion kind overshadows the action is grounds for losing some potential fans, but for anybody who's been looking for a decent fight movie that doesn't skimp on theatrics, you've found it here.

The story: BJ Quinn (Barrett,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Gymkata/dp/B00005JP3R/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Gymkata</a>) was the middleweight champion of the kickboxing world when an accidental murder and the testimony of his arch rival Jacques Denard (Brad Morris) puts him behind bars and bans him from further professional competition. Once out of prison, following the humiliating defeat of his best friend and pupil Chad Hunter (Keith Vitali,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Revenge-of-the-Ninja/dp/B000092Q4V/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Revenge of the Ninja</a>) by Denard, Quinn receives a proposal to fight the sadistic current champ for the prize of $100,000...but will he accept?

The most off-putting thing of the movie, for those expecting a typical beat-`em-up flick, is that the balance between drama and action is about 60-40 in favor of the former. Yes, there are only three real kickboxing matches scattered among a few short ones and some sparring scenes, but the major redeeming quality among the action is that the fights are very, very good. Devoid of quick cuts, cheat editing, and bad choreography, this is probably the single best example of realistic kickboxing done right in a film. The main fights are well-rounded and remain creative despite their length (e.g. the final Quinn-Denard showdown lasts nine minutes) and despite their confinement to the ring - no street fighting or underground brawling here, folks. I know that nine times out of ten, ""realistic"" means boring, but what we have here is that one exception: if you appreciate real physical ability and expert forms over blood and modern CGI, then the fights found here will not disappoint.

When considering the substantial drama portion of the film, you're inevitably going to appreciate it less than me if you're judging against the likes of De Niro or Eastwood. Granted, there is a lot of nonsense going on in the script, not least of all being the whole macho aspect that keeps the film going even when it could have ended early had both BJ and Chad had just swallowed their pride and just steered clear of Denard, but hey - what do you expect from a film like this? The fact remains that the characters and storyline therein are much more developed than you'd expect to find in any other B-grade fight film. The acting is about as good as it gets for Cannon actioneers: Keith Vitali is a bit weak but nonetheless sincere, and Brad Morris does his role by way of an evil Van Damme impersonation, but it works. John Barrett shows promise as a legitimate performer, and Terry Norton (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Proteus/dp/B0006B9784/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Proteus</a>) eventually makes a decent showing as his wife. Ted Le Plat, who would reprise his role in the more predictable sequel (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/To-the-Death/dp/6302900220/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">To the Death</a>), helps tie things together as a muckracking journalist whom you hate at one moment and applaud the next, which isn't something anybody can instill.

Eventually, it comes down to whether you can accept the very cool martial arts giving a bit of way to a cast of B-actors acting their way through the script instead of kicking. As an action-lover, I had my reservations about giving the film such a high score, but eventually, I realized that ""American Kickboxer"" is so rare a beast that it deserves credit just for existing.

8080485,3,B000AYEL1U,"Yes its true, American Kickboxer 1 is a pure American made kickboxing movie that actually has a better story than the action.  Not that the story is anything that will win any awards, but it has some depth and development between character relationships.

John Barret (To The Death, Shootfighter) plays B.J. Quinn, the middleweight kickboxing champion of the world who's unpredictable rage and temper put him in jail for 10 months for accidently killing a man at an after fight party, where his nemesis Jaques Denard, pushed B.J. to the limit.  After his release, Quinn trains hard with another kickboxer, Chad Taylor played by Keith Vitali (Superfights, No Retreat No Surrender 3), hoping Taylor will defeat Denard.  Denard beats Taylor, becoming the new middleweight kickboxing champion.  Because Quinn can not compete professionlly due to his sentence, a $100,000 fight is set up for Quinn and Denard.  But in the meantime, Quinn deals with strong emotions within himself and those around him.

Despite the story to American Kickboxer, better acting could have made it more enjoyable.  I have to say the actors are about ok in this film - many movies of this calibur have worse acting and some have better.  The biggest dissapointment is the fighting.  There are plenty of ring fights, mainly between the main characters, but they look fake and tiresome.  You can even clearly see the camera jump a bit due to bad editing during the fight scenes.  The last fight in the movie between Quinn and Denard lasts a good 9 minutes.  The best part is when Denard throws Quinn  over the ropes and out of the ring.  As for the bad guy Denard, I have to give some credit that he does a pretty convincing job with his character.

American Kickboxer is the opposite of what I expected in every way.  The fighting is much worse than I assumed, yet the story is actually better.  I'd say give this one a try if you are looking for a bad American kickboxing movie with a little more story to it.  Its not the worst movie of its kind made though, thats for sure.",1157587200,2,2048,4.686274509803922
8080486,4,B000AYEL1U,"This is the first part of the movie of To The Death which got me baffled coz they didn't use the title name American Kickboxer 2. However, there is an American Kickboxer 2 but stars Dale 'apollo' Cook and has nothing to do with American Kickboxer 1 and the sequel To The Death. Anyway, I enjoyed this movie because it had Keith Vitali in it and he shows good skill although he doesnt have many fight scenes and loses a couple of times in this film. Rick Quinn the reigning champion has just won against Chad Hunter (Keith Vitali) but at his promoters after party he ends up in a drunken argument with Denard (Brad Morris) and both began having a bit of a push and shove contest with Denard but Rick reacts, killing a man who was trying to help break up the fight between the contenders and is sentenced to jail and suspended from fighting in any sort of martial arts competition. Rick starts training Chad for his upcoming bout with Denard but loses again and is put in hospital. Quinn fanatically trains to peak fitness and has no choice but to fight Denard after Denard publicly challenges him to this ultimate martial arts showdown. An action packed kickboxing film that takes a riveting look behind the scenes of the proffessional game.",1131408000,,1240,4.540178571428571
8080487,5,B000AYEL1U,"Brad Morris is triumphant in ""American Kickboxer 1"" as ring heavy

Jacques Denard, a relentlessly self-promoting middleweight kickboxing champion.  Described by a sports announcer in the movie as ""the man the crowds love to hate,""  the colorful champ

blocks the ""boos"" of scornful fans by plugging in his Walkman

and dancing indifferently around the ring.  He taunts his competitors by erupting into a rock-star kickboxer, who wears

loud arena gear and distracts them with mercurial punches before

overcoming them with direct hits. Denard doesn't break the rules

to win his matches.  He reinvents them.

The role of Denard in this fight saga presents an actor with lots of opportunities to chew the scenery.  But, Brad Morris shrewdly avoids any over-acting traps and brings Denard to life at a perfect pitch that never reduces the wily champ to a martial arts stereotype. The talented Morris, who developed his skills as a celebrated stage actor from Johannesburg, certainly portrays Denard's flamboyance, but he also allows the audience to see the volatility and insecurities that both handicap and fuel his ambitions.  Morris' performance elevates ""Boxer"" far above Hollywood's usual arena angst dramas.

Morris also contributed to the film as its assistant fight choreographer, but it is his range and intensity as an actor that make multiple viewings of the movie compelling and assure

its frequent showings on television over a decade after its

original theatrical release.  Brad Morris is a must-watch actor,  and ""American Kickboxer 1"" is a must-see movie for martial arts fans.",1125187200,2,1593,5.278884462151394
