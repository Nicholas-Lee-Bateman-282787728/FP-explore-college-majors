5563262,2,B00B8O4WQA,Another Lovecraft graduate film project with some potential and certainly better special-effects than the last one I reviewed.  Perfect fodder while sorting clean laundry or picking up your room. Between the acting and the characters you wind up rooting for the evil jerk ex-husband. Another interesting concept take off on a Lovecraft classic that just slipped out of everyone's grasp during production.,1417910400,2,404,5.516129032258065
5563263,4,B00B8O4WQA,"This is an Indie Cthulhu movie.  Obviously low budge.  It's set in the Dreamlands so if that is the setting you like then it's fine, though not typical Cthulhu in nature in that there aren't any of the regular monsters, but if you are a Cthulhian hardcore fan, then it probably needs to be in your collection.",1413331200,,309,4.4035087719298245
5563264,3,B00B8O4WQA,"Brett Piper has made a name for himself as one of the most unique and dedicated low budget filmmakers over the last couple of decades; his brazen use of archaic  usual techniques and mix of horror and humor have given him the same cache as underground filmmakers. He's like a well kept secret for devout fans of weird cinema.

""The Dark Sleep"" is credited to HP Lovecraft, though that's more for a plentiful use of tropes and style than anything resembling an actual adaptation. Sure, Brown Jenkins is here and there's a lot of screwy dream sequences, but the film really bears little resemblance to Lovecraft's work.

That being said, Piper does fill the movie with a lot of cool images through he trademark use of stop motion and matte effects work. Piper has a defined style that makes all of his creations unmistakably his own; you could never imagine Ray Harryhausen coming up with these things!

Unfortunately, the movie slips with the story, which is a cumbersome tale about a rather unpleasant woman haunted by visceral nightmares of another world. In her waking life, she deals with an ex-husband that's at odds with her and generally tries to make his life a living Hell.

The story's a flop and while the effects work helps salve that burden, it can't make up for how much time we spend around a bunch of miserable people doing very little of anything. I feel like a 3 is a bit forgiving, but there's so many cool pieces here I can't go lower.",1405814400,4,1454,4.598455598455598
5563265,5,B00B8O4WQA,"The Dark Sleep is an enjoyable adaptation of H.P. Lovecraft.  Stop motion effects.  Camp.  Creative filmmaking.  It's all there.  Piper fans will consider this a must-own.  Others might not love it, but it's solid b-movie fun.  The only complaint, the main actress could've been better.  If you're that special audience, you'll love it.",1399507200,,336,5.2075471698113205
5563266,4,B00B8O4WQA,"First of all, this movie is very low budget and about 1/3 of the movie is on green screen/special effects.  If you're a HP Lovecraft fan you'll immediately see and ""get it"", if you're not then the movie may not make as much sense till the end.  For the budget, special effects and especially the acting (far above the level of the budget- the makers got their money's worth in the main actress), the movie is a good solid ""Lovecraft""/""Cthulhu"" movie.  If you're not into the works of HP Lovecraft I'm sure it'll come across as a cheaply made movie with no rhyme or reason.  To the fan, the rhymes & reasons are there.  I give it 4 stars.",1395014400,9,637,4.319327731092437
5563267,1,B00B8O4WQA,"THE DARK SLEEP is not totally inept. The stop-motion animation and CGI effects are nicely done. Low-budget, but still impressive.

But the bad outweighs the good...

* Poor actors. Most lines are delivered flatly, or stilted, or affected. These people are obviously ""acting"" -- or trying to -- rather than performing naturally, seamlessly, so as to resemble real people rather than ""actors."" The cast performs with the skills of a high school drama class.

But okay, I've seen plenty of low-budget horror films with stilted acting. I can forgive that if the film is entertaining. But THE DARK SLEEP has other problems which kill any potential for fun.

* The worst element is Ashley Galloway's performance. Her performance, rather than just her, because not only is she a poor actress (like the rest of the cast), but she makes poor choices, which indicates that the director is also to blame. A poor actress, badly directed.

Galloway plays the lead -- the heroine -- which is a problem because her character, as written and played by her, is so UNLIKEABLE. A real byatch. She carps and complains like a spoiled brat. She snaps at or threatens even decent people who are trying to help her (e.g., the exterminators, the professor). She's usually in a bad mood. But even in a good mood she's unlikeable, because then she gloats or smirks.

Part of the problem is how her character is written. But that's only part of the problem. Galloway infuses sarcasm or petulance into lines that might have been delivered sympathetically. All through the film, I was waiting for her character to get her comeuppance, but it turns out we're supposed to root for her character.

Thus, Galloway's performance and the story go off in opposite directions -- a disagreeable character in the role of a heroine -- making for an annoying non-horror film.

I say non-horror, because this film isn't scary or creepy. It's tepid. A horror film should threaten sympathetic characters. There should be victims. One of Sam Raimi's rules of horror is ""The innocent must suffer."" But THE DARK SLEEP ignores that rule, to its detriment.

* As for THE DARK SLEEP's story ...

I've read some of Lovecraft's stories, though not the one this film is based on, so I'm not judging THE DARK SLEEP by its faithfulness to the original tale but on its own merits. And based on that, the film's premise is interesting. A painting bears geometric patterns that lead to other dimensions, ones filled with monsters and such. But while the stop-motion animation effects are nice in those other dimensions, there are no real scares.

I don't mind a low-budget horror film with bad acting and rough production values -- provided the film is entertaining and enjoyable. Many films are like that. But THE DARK SLEEP is not one of them. It has the bad acting, but the lead character makes for an annoying viewing experience.",1388275200,8,2874,4.821138211382114
5563268,3,B00B8O4WQA,"This movie could have been better by updating some of the graphics. I realize it was a toungue in cheek presentation, but the awfully created rat creatures, the demon dogs and the ""dead man"" made it completely underwhelming. One actress, Taylor Adams, was the highlight of the movie. She was poised and beautiful and made the movie worth watching.",1378944000,4,347,4.898305084745763
5563269,5,B00B8O4WQA,"I really enjoyed this film. Yes, it was done on a low budget, most indies are. However, the CGI, although not up to blockbuster standards was still decent. The main protagonist, although whiney and bitchy at times, was easy on the eyes and proved to be a strong character in the end. Along with Dirt Dauber and Die Farbe this is one of the better Lovecraftian films out there, not on the level of HPLHS, but just bubbling under.",1378166400,3,428,4.430379746835443
5563270,1,B00B8O4WQA,The storyline made no sense and the special effects looked like something a third grader made for a science project.,1370995200,4,116,4.85
5563271,4,B00B8O4WQA,"Being a fan of low-budget H.P. Lovecraft adaptations and a big fan of the films of Brett Piper, buying a copy of Dark Sleep was a no brainer.  Dark Sleep is inspired by the short story ""Dreams in the Witch House""; I stress the term ""Inspired"".  Only a few of the elements of the original Lovecraft story are present in Piper's script.  Not a problem for me, but a lot of Lovecraft fan boys tend to obsess on changes made to the original material.  That said, all of the truly fun element of the original Lovecraft story remain: Brown Jenkin, Euclidian Geometry, and Surreal Dream Sequences.  Piper's film follows a young writer who is recently divorced from her husband and is struggling to put her life back together in a new house.  And if her life wasn't bad enough, the house she has just moved into has Brown Jenkin living in the walls, and a dimensional portal in the basement.",1366502400,25,883,4.4875

8564204,4,B00B8O4WQA,"When I got this, I  didn't expect a lot. I have to admit this was better than I expected. Yes, this is a low budget film, but it worked ever well. Perhaps better than a big budget film would have been. The effects worked surprisingly well, and seemed more appropriate than CGI. It added to the overall feeling of the movie. It's been a long time since I read Lovecraft, so I'm not sure how true to the story it is, but the script moved along well enough. I thought Ashley Galloway wasn't bad, better than the rest of the cast. To put this in context, I had just watched The Shuttered Room the night before, and I can honestly say The Dark Sleep is WAY better. This is one of the better Lovecraft adaptations.",1442707200,,708,4.2444444444444445

8564207,1,B00B8O4WQA,"Sure wish I had read Thomas M. Sipos' review more closely before I bought this piece of garbage. I associate myself completely with his assessment. The main actress, Ashley Galloway, is either a superb actress or no actress at all and really is a class A1 biotch. My opinion tends towards the latter. Truly a landmark in film making with a despicable lead. I also suffered through the film with a faint hope of seeing that skank of a shrew get hers. No joy.

It did have interesting and fairly high quality special effects, especially for a Lovecraftian themed budget film. You've got to hammer the director, though, for letting what might have been an acceptable ""B"" movie subside into trash bin material with that truly horrendous acting. I'd give it to Goodwill but that would only make some other poor soul have to suffer through this rubbish. Probably the worst waste of my time and money in years. And that's saying something.",1429574400,2,932,4.717791411042945
