If you are more advanced it has great information that we all need to review from time to time in order to remember good habits.  So, I liked it!",1525046400,,321,4.031746031746032

8601208,5,B00E4V97YG,"This is an excellent introduction to watercolor painting by one of America's masters.  It takes you from the fundamentals of palette layout, brushes, paints, and paper choices all the way through the steps of color mixing, local color, values, and applying paint to paper.  One of the best aspects is that he shows the entire process including the pencil drawing.  So many watercolor demos start with an already prepared pencil sketch foundation and proceed to add watercolor.  Not so here, he draws everything from the beginning and explains the total process as he goes.  In the last disk he does an elaborate still life (which he has drawn at the end of the previous disk), explaining every step and making mistakes along the way as all real artists do, i.e., it is not a rehearsed performance as most demos are.  There are no fast forwards.  Charles Reid paints in a very loose and wet style and does not stay in the lines, but even if you do not paint in this style, there is much value to be gained from this set.",1509926400,5,1019,4.565934065934066
8601209,5,B00E4V97YG,"Ive been afraid of watercolors because they come out like mud. This video even shows how to avoid that and many other mistakes.
The many lessons provided cover everything, including the basic setup and drying techniques. I cant stop watching the lessons. For a beginner like me this is great and I think it can help any level artist.  Well worth the investment.
Unlike many other videos, the audio is clear because background noises and whistling have been removed.",1486944000,9,465,4.886075949367089
8601210,5,B00E4V97YG,"This is a very well made instructional video.  The images were clear and showed true colors.  This was especially helpful when Charles demonstrated varying shades of paint colors.  The subtleties were evident.  This instructional video made excellent use of captions and notes printed on the screen to reinforce what Charles was demonstrating.  His contour drawing is exceptional.  I found his control of the brush different from what I am used to but something I will try in order to produce the flowing, color rich results Charles achieves.  Watching the magic unfold as he painted his floral inspires me to try to create more flowing watercolor paintings.",1458864000,21,658,5.150943396226415
