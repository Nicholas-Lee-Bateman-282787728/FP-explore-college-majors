8269415,5,B0018C8KRY,"An excellent film which attempts, in 25 minutes, to explain the Cold War and the battle against communist ideas. It looks at political, economic and ideological efforts of the communists to dominate the planet. Edward R. Murrow narrates most of the program, which is very well done.",1385510400,,282,5.0212765957446805
