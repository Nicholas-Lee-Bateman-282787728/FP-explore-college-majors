Am pleased to report that their EXPLOSIVE 4 Action Movies set is of fine quality.
Although over six hours of video are on a single dual-layer DVD,
there's no pixillation issues and no on-screen watermarks.

Audio on LOGAN'S WAR is stereo, and it has a particularly sharp full screen picture.
(Transfers of the other three are quite fine. There's no extras, not even a scene access menu.)

BROTHERHOOD OF JUSTICE is interesting for it presents some future stars as teens.
Decent, but a somewhat slow-moving TV film about six high schoolers who become vigilantes.

By contrast, producer/director John Woo has no one but himself to blame for BLACKJACK,
an action film/failed back door pilot that's as laughably bad as anything seen on MST3K.
Slow motion shootouts, motorbike tricks plus all the usual explosions and
immolations parade by in what is ultimately a waste of two hours.

Haven't seen LASER MISSION yet, but as is I'm satisfied with this five buck item.
