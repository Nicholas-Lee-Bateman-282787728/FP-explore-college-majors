3595762,4,B001G5IK32,"The Complete Master Works 2 is absolutely hilarious!  You don't need it though if you're buying Tenacious D and the Pick of Destiny.  This DVD is a live concert filmed in Seattle, but it's still very funny and worth buying.  The only reason why I said ""You don't need it though if you're buying Tenacious D and the Pick of Destiny."" is because it's a live concert of Tenacious D and the Pick of Destiny.  A lot of people don't realize this, so that's why I'm saying all this.  I do highly recommend buying this because it's very hilarious!

3595773,5,B001G5IK32,I went to the concert in Vegas. I enjoyed the dvd concert more.  They seemed to be more polished in Seattle.  Maybe my expectations were too high.  Watching the concert years later may have given them a fairer review of their new songs.  The documentary was better than the concert.  Would never have guessed what was going on behind the scenes.  (Letterman is a jerk.) The best part of the set are the extra performances from Conan O Brien and SNL.  Classic D.,1279152000,,461,4.481927710843373
3595774,5,B001G5IK32,"Can it get any better?

NOPE.

Well, at least not after this DVD came out and rocked the World and the ""D"" went all electric---in a good way---for the latter half.

Going through ""the hits""---if one should call 'em that---to an adoring audience, JB and KG simply stole the show. If not for ""Lee"", otherwise known as ""Satan"", ""Bigfoot"", ""The Metal"", etc., and ""the Band"" we would have had pretty much ""Vol. I"" only with a slight redux.

Not the case here. Sharper, better recordings and more ""toit"", the ""D"" have never sounded nor look---er, ok---so they've NEVER sounded better. The only down is the lame humor with ""the Band"" in Character when they first meet in Hell. The awkward scene about why the ""Band""---Col. Sanders and Charlie Chaplin---are in Hell is just about the only unfortunate part of the whole DVD.

But...I can live with that.

You feel like you're with the guys on the stage. Camerawork is awesome and there's just BARELY enough audience shots to involve you, and it never crosses the line into ""too much"", where you're just praying they don't show the fat chick doing the butt bump with her equally round sister for too long (OK, so there's never really any fat chicks shown. I was only using that as a hypothetical example---hmmm....coincidence? I think not...)

Highlights are Wonderboy, ""Saxophone"", Beelzeboss, ""The Metal"", and of course the ephemeral ""Greatest Song in the World"" but the whole thing is a rollicking ""Tribute"" (like how I did that just then? ok...ok...bad...sorry) from beginning to end.

Put the kids to bed, snuggle up with those you love, and get down with the ""D"". If you weren't a fan, you will be licking the sweat off of the D by the end of the show. It never gets old, and the Blu-Ray treatment is just what Satan ordered for the ""World's Greatest Acoustic Part Time Heavy Metal Band who are Also Actors"" band knows simply as:

Tenacious D: JB/KG ... Don't fight it. Give in to it. Live the Dream with the D.",1278979200,,1957,4.649275362318841
3595775,3,B001G5IK32,I decent movie with many F bombs. It was interesting and very funny to see what started out as a fun project and a joke became serious and stressful.,1277424000,,149,4.172413793103448
3595776,5,B001G5IK32,As fun as the first one but with a hell more extras and the tour of the Concert is hillarious... Excellent,1268092800,,106,4.095238095238095

3595778,5,B001G5IK32,"I never get tired of watching this concert! This a very well filmed Seattle concert with Jack Black and Kyle Gas at their very best and is a must-have to complete your Tenacious D video collection. View it on a large screen TV with surround sound and crank it up! You will not be disappointed. Can't think of any parts I didn't like about the concert, its all good. I give this a double thumbs up, 5 stars all the way. Not for children with its adult themes, but a great buy for adults who are D fans or just music fans in general.",1257638400,,531,4.115384615384615
3595789,4,B001G5IK32,"I am a big Tenacious D fan, and love their work, just as a heads up, this one doesn't have as many laughs as Master works 1. Probably because they didn't have as much material to work with, because the HBO episodes are the best thing on the first one. This one has one episode called 'time fixers' in it that is pretty funny. I would still recommend buying it to any Tenacious D fan, because the D will rock your socks off.",1256601600,,423,4.108433734939759
3595790,5,B001G5IK32,"Two reasons is all you need to buy this DVD.  The Tenacious Documentary is painfully honest, but so real that it is a ""must-see"".  Basically, the package is worth the price for the documentary alone.  However, the concert footage is also amazing, and is also a great reason to buy this DVD set.  The D are surprisingly talented, either in stripped down form or in the totally blown out ""stadium show"" rock band format.

In the end, I agree with both KG and JB when it comes to The D.  KG's desire to keep the overall concept pure, is noble and ultimately the ""right"" thing to do.  JB's desire to take The D to the mainstream masses is also correct, and the full band stage show proves that it can work.  There is an interesting schism between the two, and it makes this period in the history of The D, all the more compelling.",1251936000,,826,4.318181818181818
3595791,4,B001G5IK32,"Doc on disc 2 is great so is the time travel skit and music vids, but I gotta say the concert got a little tiring. More D is always a good thing but alot of these songs are well played out. And I think the addition of the full band kills alot of what makes the D special. Dvd is definetly worth buying especially for the 2nd disc but I can't rate this a whole 5 stars. That said hopefully their next album brings fresh feeling back to the Ds concerts.",1251849600,,451,3.967032967032967
3595792,5,B001G5IK32,"I saw the D when they were in concert in L.A. a few years back.  They do a good job capturing the stage show.

But, my favorite part of the blu-ray is the documentary they did about their whirlwind tour during the release of ""The Pick of Destiny.""  It's very funny and interesting, and it also gives a great insight into the real lives of JB and Mr. Gass

The other extras (some new videos and some of their live performances) are great as well.  The menu is interesting and funny and the whole package was great.

I can only hope that they put out ""The Complete Masterworks 1"" out on blu-ray in the future.  [...]",1246752000,,614,4.241379310344827
3595793,5,B001G5IK32,"I can't believe no one has really mentioned ""Time Fixers"" in their review.

""Time Fixers"" is one of the Tenacious D short films found on disc 2. And I'd say it's more funny than any of the shorts offered on the first Master Works.

Basically, it's an episode of a fictional television series, where Jack and Kyle are regularly summoned by Michael Keaton (who makes a hilarious cameo via Cutless Supreme video monitor) to fix the problems created by the Time Goblin (played by Lee). The D must go back in time to make sure that Abe Lincoln gets shot during the Ford Theatre play.

Hilarious, to say the least. Probably my favorite part of the whole set.

As for the rest of it...

Wow. Just wow. I can honestly say I like this set twice as much as the first. The new concert blows the old one out of the water. It begins on a stage designed to look like Kyle's apartment. The D play some acoustic hits, with Lee joining in on occasion. Suddenly, an electrical malfunction kills the greatest band of all time, sending them to Hell where they meet Colonel Sanders, Charlie Chaplin, and the Anti-Christ. Together, they form the Fellowship of the D, a full band that rocks for the remainder of the set.

This concert has it all. Video interludes, awesome props and costumes, even special effects. It's almost like watching a big-budget Broadway musical. I, for one, loved it.

The second disc is where the real gold is. The documentary contained within is simply perfect. Never before have I seen such an entertaining yet down-to-earth, honest portrayal of a band. You get to see The D during every stage of the tour, from conceptual designing to the aftermath. You see their families, their fights, their backstage worries. And none of it seems whiny or preachy. It's insightful and kind of sad at times, but I could feel nothing but respect for the guys once the whole thing was finished. Most celebrities are too afraid to show that much of themselves, especially when their success relies on comedy, not reality.

Anyway, I could talk for days about how great this set is. Buy it if you haven't already. It may not be filled with as much funny goodness as its predecessor, but I'd say it's way more interesting and a much better representation of who The D are as a band.

5 billion stars.",1246320000,,2288,4.560975609756097
3595794,4,B001G5IK32,"Purely looking at this as a concert DVD it's great. Though i wish it would've included some more extras, such as interviews and commentary. Also Tenacious D seems to have excluded their hilarious webisodes for Pick of Destiny from both the DVD for that movie and for this DVD, what gives? especially since they've since taken them down from the movie site.

I'm nitpicking though, this is really a must buy if you're a die hard fan. If you aren't then really this isn't the DVD for you. The concert is chock full of references and inside jokes only fans will get.",1246233600,,563,4.519607843137255
3595795,5,B001G5IK32,"If you are a loyal D fan then its a must to get this dvd. It gives you a more indepth look at the D with their rise to fame and its problems, and their loyalty to one another through the tough times and good.",1238371200,,208,3.6444444444444444
3595796,4,B001G5IK32,"Well I really like Tenacious D.  I think Jack Black and Kyle Gass are funny in the movies I have seen them in.  They seem like cool guys who have a band because they like to have one.  They don't need the money.  Plus how much do they actually get.  Well that's what I usually think when I hear them.  That kind of changed after seeing this DVD.  I will tell you why below.  I will also tell you about some other problems I had with this DVD.

Well I was sitting in my room at night, looking forward to seeing Jack and Kyle play some music and make me laugh.  While I did see that, there were also other people who were part of the band as well.  It sounded good to me.  But I am used to Tenacious D being just a 2 person band.  You have to get used to the other people playing with them.  It makes sense because they have something happen that looks like they go to hell.  The other band members meet them there and play with them.  There is also someone who just dances.  I didn't think about it until I watched the commentary.  Not sure how easy it will be to get used to this.  It kind of seemed like I was watching a play.  Again, I'm not sure if I liked this or not.  I mean I guess I did.  But It wasn't the D I was used to.

Now the camera.  This may have been the worst thing about this show.  The camera was moving the WHOLE time.  Seriously, as soon as you would get a good shot of Jack or Kyle playing, they would switch cameras.  It kind of made me feel sick.  I was saying to myself ""stop moving the freaking camera so much!""  I may have more of a problem with this because I only have 10% of my vision.  But It seems to me that there are others will get sick of the movement of the camera.

I think I would give the concert a 3.8 out of 5.  But the bonus features I would give a 5.  You get to see the D one a few TV shows.  As well as see the band going on tour and just living without having to act.  Some of the things said during this point I can't be sure if they are true or just the band joking around.  Like Kyle getting mad that he was not set to go on one of the shows with black.  As well as some of the other things said by the guys.

In the end though, if you like the band, you will enjoy the DVD.  You get to see the guys playing live with some of there best songs.  You also get to see the band a little different from what you may be used to.  Also, you get to see the guys when they are not in front of a big crowd or in front of a live TV audience.  Some may think the way they have set up the show is strange.  But give it a chance.  I'm sure you will enjoy.

The songs are as follows:
1. Kielbasa
2. History
3. Wonderboy
4. Dio
5. Lee
6. Saxaboom
7. The Road
8. Hell Movie Skit
9. Kickapoo

3595797,5,B001G5IK32,"This is a really good concert! These guys are really funny. A couple of things that make me crazy is the fact that the picture doesn't seem to be that great for blu-ray, and the audio is not even in digital. The audio and picture are still pretty good but not for blu-ray. This would have passed more for a good regular dvd concert. Still really good concert, and it is worth buying.",1236902400,,383,4.260273972602739

3595813,5,B001G5IK32,"The Complete Master Works 2 is a must-have for everyone, regardless of if you like Tenacious D or not.  Even if you don't own a DVD player!  Upon opening, you will be graced with not one, but TWO discs full of The D, and their legendary adventures.

Disc 1:
Perhaps the best live performance I've ever seen on (and off) video.  They weave almost every song from both their original album, and their movie (Pick of Destiny) soundtrack into a hilarious story starting from Kyle's apartment and ending up in Hell.  The songs transition very well from one to the next, and if you are familiar with their music, you can at some points even predict the next song just by how the story is progressing.  They put so much energy into the music, that I found myself singing along for most of it.  I wish the solos were longer.  Kyle Gass has amazing musical talent, and I could have listened to him jam out much longer than he did.  I've watched it 5 times, and it never gets old.

Disc 2
A documentary of their tour and debut of the Pick of Destiny movie.  You'll get a great inside look on the ups and downs during their world tour, which will let you see why ""The road is f'ing hard. It's also really f'ing tough.""  There is also some doc. time spent on Kyle's other band, Trainwreck, who he plays guitar for.  Overall it's a great documentary for an even greater band.",1231804800,,1362,4.335968379446641
3595814,5,B001G5IK32,"The Complete Masterworks 2 is a worthy companion to the first CM DVD, a set that used to feel like the end-all-be-all for visual Tenacious D goodness until the Pick of Destiny CD and feature film. This set succeeds not so much because it emulates the first DVD, which it some ways it does, but because it presents a somewhat different version of the band.

Let's start with the concert. This concert finds the D using more elaborate sets and following a sort of storyline over the course of the show. They are also backed up by backup musicians for some songs. It's a great show whether or not you like the changes in the performances and a worthy documentation of this previously new side of Tenacious D.

However, the focal point of this new set isn't the concert, much to my own surprise. The documentary ""D-Tour"" is absolutely jarring. It  will shake the foundations of how you view this band. At first, it's hard to tell whether the band is joking or not when they express their concerns and frustrations about this time period (playing with a band, their film doing poorly, and an increased attention to Jack over Kyle by the media). In fact, the first few times that frustrations do become manifest you're likely to take it as a bit of humor on the part of the guys. However, as the film goes on the problems begin to show themselves as real and not a play for laughs. It's a very realistic look at the band that hasn't been done before to my knowledge. This is Tenacious D - honest, open, and vulnerable. If you are a D fan, this documentary will stick with you for a while.

Don't take this as a paint-by-numbers DVD set. It captures the D at a time where at their most dramatic. While the first set caught the D at a high point, this shows the D from another angle - where things aren't going as well as they did before. But despite all of that, you come away having a deeper appreciation of the relationship between these two guys. A must-have.",1231718400,,1955,4.407202216066482
3595815,5,B001G5IK32,"This is a film about the greatest and best band ever recorded in the history of recording technology.

This is a fantastically real behind the scenes look at the D on world tour during the opening of and unfortunate flop of their film ""The Pick of Destiny.""  If you are a D fan, this along with the ""Complete Masterworks"" are a must have.  This film, the more serious of the two chronicles their world tour from a completely candid perspective.  You will see a side of D you have never seen before and will probably never see again.  The second disc in this two disk set includes the concert itself.

If you do not own the ""Complete Masterworks"" I recommend it first as it is classic D at their best.  This set ""The Complete Masterworks 2"" is more serious look at the trials and tribulations of the band during the tour, release of their film and the promotional engagements.  I loved it.

The energy the Jack and Kyle displayed on stage was intense. This DVD captures all the aspects of the live show. I have been waiting and hoping for the concert to be released on DVD and I got myself an early Christmas present. Jack does drop the ""F"" bomb quite often, but in the context of what's happening when the ""D"" perform it fits beautifully.

This 2 DVD set contains a fully produced concert which is loaded with fun  songs..excellent musicianship and an actual story line! It is a first rate production.  The second disc has a hilarious documentary (and if you purchase at BEST BUY an additional 30 minutes of out takes)...there are also some cool appearances on SNL, Conan etc..

Its a very worthwhile bit of fun and music....which I'm having a pretty hard time describing because I  can't think of anybody crazy enough to have done  anything like it.  They are mistakenly linked to Spinal Tap but other than a rock and comedy element I don't see  it....Tap was a parody all the way and this ....well it stands on its own.  It isn't even garage band stuff for the most part...its more like the kind of music a couple of 16  year olds would do  in their bedrooms and perhaps that has a certain appeal to me as a kid who played guitar with his buddy and wrote equally horrible songs in High School.

This new set gives us an excellent live concert featuring a full band, incredible live versions of ""Tribute"", ""Friendship"", ""Kickapoo"" (Great vocals by Kyle, and oh, the other guy, too!). These guys have never sounded better! Rage Cage's incredible guitar work deserves a mention here. This guy is a master on the acoustic guitar! The bonus disc includes a behind the scenes documentary that fans of the band will enjoy. Near the end of this, we get some insight into the creative process and are treated as the D performs a new song which is, well, incedible! I hope this song makes it onto a new album soon!
