8507457,2,B0070225OK,"I just don't understand why Discovery/GAIAN puts out these collections with content from their previous collection sets. With this new collection - Buster's Biggest Crashes, you get four episodes. The first, ""Buster Special"" is a clip show - Adam and Jamie really don't much of anything new, just rebuild Buster and reminisce about previous shows were they have destroyed Buster. The bits of episodes that you see in this 49 minute episode are;

- Exploding Toilet
- Barrel of Bricks
- Hammer Drop
- Raccoon Rocket
- Killer Laundry
- Mad Trombonist
- Forrest Fire Scuba Diver
- Elevator of Death
- Boom Lift Catapult
- Plywood Builder
- Ming Dynasty Astronaut

The second episode on the DVD is the Cooling Six-Pack from the Collection 1 DVD set.

The Third episiode is Buried in Concrete from Collection 3 DVD set.

The fourth is the Mega Movie Myths show - from the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mythbusters-Mega-Movie-Myths/dp/B000LPS2SQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mythbusters - Mega Movie Myths</a>

If you already have all or most of the other collections and specials - feel free to skip this new collection. One other thing that really bugged me about this DVD collection, the picture is presented in Full Frame 1.33/1 aspect ratio, but inside that square - the show is in letterbox format - so on a new flat screen tv, you end up with wide black bars on either side of the picture and black bars on the top & bottom of the screen. Annoying to me, but at least they did one thing I liked - there are subtitles on all of the episodes.",1345852800,17,1584,4.984848484848484
