2799125,4,B0009A3I6O,"This is an 'old' film in terms of its picture quality, but it provides an interesting view of colonial life in a small 19-century Brazilian town.  And  who is not to like the performances of Sonia Braga and Marcello Mastroianni? Worth watching.",1448064000,,244,4.785714285714286

2799132,5,B0009A3I6O,"I wore out a bootleg VHS of this film decades ago.  It is classic and wonderful.  The characters will draw you in, and the battle between pure simplicity and ""civilized"" complexity will make you wish you, too, could remember how to see life's pleasures through a child's eyes even the way Gabriela does.  You'll also appreciate the change in attitudes, as Brazil's parallel to the American wild west, with it's ""Colonels"" in power, begins to crumble when the world's advances step in.  After the movie, be sure to read the book, Gabriela, Clove and Cinnamon, by Jorge Amado.  It is listed among the classic novels of Brazil.  Then, see the movie, again.",1291161600,4,653,4.785714285714286

8186367,5,B0009A3I6O,"This is a great movie that faithfully adapts Amado's classic novel of love and social change and gender respect in the post-colonial frontier of Brazil.  It is comic, tragic, and just plain revealing (also in the sense of very explicit female nudity and sex).  Braga and Mastroianni are a great match.  Her earthy vitality and his weary, yet smoldering, charm are really a nice combination.  You really learn something about the transformation of Brazilian society from a plantation to a mercantile society.  The movie is old but still fresh and authentic.  The subtitles are well done and do not detract from the drama.",1502928000,,620,4.970873786407767

8186369,5,B0009A3I6O,"A classic. Marcelo at his best and Sonia at her most beautiful. This is one of my all time favorite movie. Then there is the music.
It's simply a masterpiece. Not to be shared with the children, but to be be enjoyed with someone who would also like a hot tropical movie.
In portugese with English subtitles, but you don't notice because the movie takes you straight to Brasil in the 20'. You'll be speaking portugese after a few minutes. The movie is magical. It should have ten stars.",1478217600,,485,4.46067415730337

8186372,5,B0009A3I6O,Beautiful Brazilian film. Jorge Amado the story teller!,1463616000,,55,6.0
8186373,2,B0009A3I6O,"Poorly done, poorly acted.  I think the film maker had a thing for the actress, that's about it.  Even Marcello was disappointing.",1463356800,,130,4.863636363636363
8186374,4,B0009A3I6O,"The four stars are for the over all movie. The picture is good and the sound is good. Its not Criterion Collection quality but its real watchable  I first saw this film in Los Angeles in 1986 and Sonia Braga was a revelation. Memories were made of this film and that time and place.  But the real issue is not the film itself but the quality of the DVD from ""Pure Brazil"" ... the folks selling this small but really great  film.  Toward the end, with about ten minutes left the picture stops, starts stops again. Then finally it carries on from there to the end. Never mind that your following and the flow of the film has been broken. I've watched the film twice ... its there.  I was okay with the outrages cost of the DVD, if ( and only IF )  nothing was wrong with the quality of the film ... again this is a pretty good print of the film.  In the past I would have griped and demanded a replacement,  and for what it cost ( $65 ) I still should, but ... its a quality issue that no doubt will be in the replacement.  My guess is, I got burnt. So think long and hard if you want this really good film that has QC issue... I can't be the only one with this problem.  Memories are NOT made of  this.",1462579200,,1201,4.025316455696203
