i bought the 30 day weight subliminal loss program that was produced by the same people and had good luck with it, so i decided to try this also. so far so good with this program. but i did have to watch the dvd a few times before i started it to make sure i was doing the process correct. when i say watched a few times i mean i just reviewed the last few chapters of the dvd. dvd is set up like a book and is real easy to follow.

right now i have stopped eating cookies. my next junk food i am going to work on is donuts.

i recommend the program if you have a junk food(s) that you want to stop or cut back on.

8324041,5,B000BIUFCE,"i took a chance and bought this dvd program. i had to watch  the last chapters a few times before i started the program to make sure i would be doing it correct. then i used the cd the first few times i did the progam, which was a great help. i did the program for potato chips. after the 21 days i can say i really do not desire chips anymore and i have lost weight.

next month i wil be doing it for my favorite candy that i want to cut back on eating.

production is good on the dvd and the man on camera is also very good teaching the program.

money well spent.
