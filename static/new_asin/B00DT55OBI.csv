5854586,5,B00DT55OBI,"This makes more sense than all the others. I heard the shots, BAM,,,,,,,,,,,,,,BAM-BAM.
the Warren comission paid no attention to Gov. Conley. He said the first shot missed, hit the road in front of a witness 23 feet away, and he said he turned around and looked up to see what was going on and was hit by the second shot. The balistics show a straight line from Oswald to Kennedy's neck, and Gov Conley's sholder and hand.
People with no experience in dealing with WWII firearms don't know how much penetrating power they have.
The M1 will go through 6 men. and the rifle Oswald was using wasn't that powerful, but still packed a punch.
George Hickey stood up and bent over and picked up the AR 15 in the floor of the car.
When the second shot was fired, the driver of the car behind Kennedy stomped the gas, the the big 420 cubic engine with two four barrel carbs jumped forward, causing him to fall back with the AR 15 causing it to fire hitting Kennedy in the back of the head.
The doctors at Dallas were not allowed to do the autopsy bacause they were protecting
George Hickey,
This car would burn rubber at 70 MPH.
The doctor in Dallas said he counted 40 pieces of lead in Kennedy's brain, proving that the bullet that did the damage was a .223 Hollow Point, and not the Full Metal Jacket that Oswald was shooting.",1384646400,29,1320,4.348178137651822
5854587,1,B00DT55OBI,"Anything on JFK assassination that comes from MSM is biased and distorted. Modern forensics can not include bullets from same gun. Testimony from Conally's doctor's contradicts CE 399. Wounds in clothing do not match WC bullet path. ""Bunching"" does not coincide. Ford moved entry wound. Enemy of Truth by Feister, head wound specialist, flatly contradicts beveling skull testimony. Bullet goes though ten pieces of wood unscathed but skull breaks it apart?
Most importantly, fragments in brain X ray do not support rear shot and are not addressed.
Powerful rear spatter is not addressed as forward movement before forceful rear movement is consistent with frontal shot in modern analysis.
""Nervous system  convulsion"" (jet affect"")  a rearward movement is specious and discredited.
This is another in a long line of Dale Meyers, Max Holland, WC apologists who are unaware of contradictions that have emerged with modern forensics on head wounds.

5854588,5,B00DT55OBI,"Veteran top Australian investigator brings tremendous expertise, skill, and bodies of knowledge to a ""cold case"" investigation, that had never been done before (!), of the existing forensic evidence to finally reach the most plausible explication of the November 22nd, 1963 assassination of the US' 35th President, John F. Kennedy. McLaren, like every professional and reliable researcher does, bases his beginning premise upon what the most well accepted ballistics study (by Donovan, since 1967 thru 1991, then co-written by Donovan and Menninger as ""Mortal Error"" [1991 repint 2013]) clearly demonstrates: --who actually is the precise person that shot the fatal bullet into JFK's head, where the so called 'missing bullet' very obviously fragmented 6mm after entering the back of JFK's skull then brain, killing him?-- That's the work disclosed by Donovan with the help of Menninger in their (1991 reprint 2013 book); a book newly reprinted in 2013 because Mclaren's findings are being made public.

McLaren does what the best researchers have by going into is own field of expertise doing a forensic cold case investigation of all of the available evidence, even what the Warren Commission, led by R-Sen. Arlen Spector suppressed!(defying, then elderly, Chief Justice Warren). The Warren Report has never been accepted as valid by the majority of the US and international public...and for very obvious reasons, at that. The Warren Commission participated in what is now known to be a very basic cover up--not a conspiracy. Therefore, McLaren not only discovers who covered up what, very clearly demonstrating that there has been a cover up all along; then, goes beyond to painstakingly offer the forensic data that explains WHY there has been a cover up about who, precisely, delivered the fatal shot into JFK's brain and from what weapon (not L.H. Oswald's).

Since the fatal bullet was not a full metal jacket ""through and through"" bullet, and was one that explodes shortly after impact, which had to have been delivered from the type of automatic weapon that deploys such devastating ammunition (an automatic sub-machine gun), Oswald's old military surplus Italian WWII era rifle could not and did not deliver that fatal bullet into JFK's head. The trajectory is wrong, for example, since the fatal shot came from near ground level and from the back left of the President. Oswald missed with his first shot which ricocheted off of a curb, grazed another person standing in the masses of spectators, and likely also sent pieces of concrete rapidly darting off which likely did strike the President, as John Connally has always reported from day one saying, 'I was not struck by the first bullet I heard'. Data, statements made to Dallas police by dozens of people both in the motorcade (including 7 Secret Service agents and the Sheriff) and the closest by-standers on the ground, clearly reveal that they saw the man with the weapon and smelled gun powder at ground level as it moved forward with the motorcade with the 15mph wind at their backs, not down and backwards from the book depository where Oswald had delivered two shots. Only one shot of Oswald's ever entered the President and John Connally. It has been mislabeled ""the magic bullet"" because the Warren Commission did not even consider how the Presidential limousine is structured. The Connally's were in the center folding seats in front of the President and Mrs. Kennedy. Those seats are lower than the back seat and more inward towards the center of the vehicle, rather like bucket seats. Thus, the trajectory of Oswald's bullet that entered the President's back, exited through his throat, was while John Connally was turned sideways looking to see where the sound of gun fire he'd heard BEFORE the second round of Oswald's hit him and JFK both, was a STRAIGHT LINE TRAJECTORY from Oswald's antiquated rifle through and through JFK and into and through and through Connally. The third bullet was a different kind and came from a semi-automatic sub-machine gun.

Rather than a conspiracy, or a theory, or a communist plot, etc...ad nauseum, learn from one very skillful and precise forensic investigator what happened on Nov. 21st, 1963 (the night before the assassination of JFK) and forward, all of which matters, to make clear who did what, how and why. I cannot spoil what McLaren needs to be credited for carefully bringing together to draw his conclusions from. See the film for yourself. When I saw the film footage, it finally made so much sense that I have now put one of the most serious questions of my lifetime to rest~",1384214400,35,4605,5.040682414698162
5854589,5,B00DT55OBI,"An interesting and compelling view of what MAY have transpired Nov. 22, 1963! It does NOT make sense that Oswald killed the president using the weapon that he used. He MAY have done it, and this has been ""proven"" by studies shwoing that someone with that weapon could do that kind of shooting...however, this video is still interesting based on the forensic science. It is time, however, that we put to rest the ""conspiracy"" theory crap and move on! If he had died 500 years ago nobody would be worried about this. The man is dead. He died too soon. It was unfair, shocking, and unexpected. But the man is dead. No amount of searching will change that. And at this point, trying to find the culprits is asinine.",1384041600,6,711,4.51937984496124
5854590,4,B00DT55OBI,"I just watched this documentary through Australian TV. I cant praise it enough. The evidence that is portrayed from experts in their field is very convincing. The documentary has standard visuals for a lower budget presentation but very much adequate. I am absolutely convinced that the conclusions from this film are plausible and likely correct.
I feel the reenactments of scenes during the documentary are good and help to give an overview of the events at the time, although again of a standard that would be expected from a lower budget documentary.
I would recommend this film to anyone interested in JFK event.

5854591,1,B00DT55OBI,"I want to state I believe in a multiple shooter scenario in the killing of our president, but this is not one I believe. This video features Colin McLaren's extension of the work of Menninger who study the ballistics and came to the conclusion Oswald and a Secret Service agent shot Kennedy. Besides the voluminous amounts of evidence pointing away from Oswald we also have the book relying the Warren Commissions autopsy information. This is a Fatal flaw as the doctors at Parkland Hospital had said the front neck wound was an Entry wound, that alone blows away every theory McLaren comes up. The doctors also said there was a back shoulder wound that only penetrated 1-2 inches. That's two bullets right there, then we need Kennedy's fatal head shot and Connely's shot. There was also another bullet that impacted on a side walk. We now have bullets flying all over Dealy Plaza.
Why I gave it two because I learned the entrance wound in the skull of Kennedy was 6 mm totally eliminating the ""Oswald"" 6.5 mm rounds used. Also, McLaren believes in the single bullet theory a bullet that smashes through Kennedy's neck and spine out his throat into Connely's ribs then wrist and finally into the thigh and only has a dent in the bullet?
The movie does a good job of showing how the Secret Service took over completely and bullied and threatened many witnesses and how the Bethesda MD Hospital autopsy was a disaster and much evidence was never seen again after that day. The movie clearly shows the Warren Commission was a scam and Arlene Spector a major Bad player in this game, but with this the author rely's heavily on the W.C. reports of the autopsy that show clear manipulation.
There is more but suffice to say I do not recommend this movie, book or conclusions.",1383782400,8,1769,4.654952076677317

5854598,2,B00DT55OBI,"Unfortunately, the theory behind this film is incorrect. Kennedy was shot in the head from the front, not the back. The evidence to support this is out there, and I'm surprised this film misses it. Even the reopening of the investigation in the '80s by the government said there was enough evidence to support a second shooter from the grassy knoll. As the guy in this movie says, the witnesses will solve the case. There were witnesses that said they heard shots from the grassy knoll, and a Polaroid picture taken that when blown up, shows a person in uniform in a rifle holding stance. I don't know if JFK: The Smoking Gun is just sloppy research or a deliberate attempt to mislead people from the actual people behind Kennedy's death, but in any case, it's wrong.

Watch ""Crossfire: The Plot that Killed Kennedy"" and ""The American Media & The 2nd Assassination Of President John F. Kennedy."" Both of these movies came out after ""JFK: The Smoking Gun"" and both do a much better job at proving that the Secret Service and CIA covered up evidence of the assassination, and both movies have the same conclusion as to who the people were behind the cover up and why. In the ""Crossfire..."" movie, even JFK's secretary believed Kennedy was taken out by a group of people, none of which are Oswald.

One last thing, keep in mind in 1961 during his farewell speech, President Eisenhower tried the warn the nation of a new threat. It was this threat that was either directly, or indirectly involved two years later to remove JFK from office.",1504483200,,1535,4.639705882352941

There is also evidence of a cover-up on the part of the Secret Service with the complicity of the Warren Commission.

Still, it is not so clear that there was no conspiracy in this and a case could be made for LBJ's involvement via George Hickey.  George Hickey was ""sent"" to guard LBJ right after the shooting.  Hickey was originally from Texas, as was LBJ, and so a prior connection was not impossible.  And many parts of the cover up were so well done that one wonders if those involved had thought about the situation before.

On the other hand, joining forces with Oswald seems pretty risky.  And as Oswald had already shot JFK, why shoot him again?  That would be a case for its being an accident.

On the third hand, you could argue that you would never expect Oswald to actually hit JFK - such a distance, and such a clumsy weapon - much better to have someone closer, only meters away, and with much more lethal ammunition.

If this was such an easy explanation, then why the coverup? That makes no sense. No matter what happened, because I honestly haven't come to any solid conclusions, the fact is that Oswald did not shoot all of the shots, and there was more than one gun used to hit the President. (Ballistics Testing) So if a SS Agent truly hit the President, wouldn't the SS agents near him in the same vehicle had tackled him when they heard the LOUD BANG coming from a gun right next to them? They are trained. No matter WHO is doing the shooting, you take them out. If that person is the person right next to them, whether a fellow agent or not, I can't help but believe that the surrounding agents would have known it was his gun that just shot a bullet forward, and they would have been all over him. Because after all, they don't know if he is involved in something bigger or not. This is the heat of the moment.

There is no discussion of alternative theories that may or may not be germane, and the focus of the film is to determine who fired the fatal shot. To that extent I am inclined to agree that the secret service agent identified is the culprit, and I am also inclined to agree that it was accidental. However, the film uses this to rule out a wider conspiracy, which could well have been independent of the fatal shot. Those types of answers are adroitly sidestepped. Perhaps they should be since the theme of the film is 'mortal error', but it leaves open more questions than answers because motive, potential other shooters and a larger conspiracy are not addressed.

Despite the gaps and omissions, I think the film did a remarkable job of providing both plausible and probable explanations of the magic bullet and put to rest the single shooter theory because of the presented facts, Oswald could not have possibly acted alone.

If you are looking for definitive answers or closure this film will leave you unsatisfied. If you are looking for a realistic reconstruction of a narrow facet of the assassination, and the science and process behind uncovering it, this film will fascinate you. It's a single data point in an event that is nowhere near being solved or explained, but at least it eliminates (plausibly) who fired the fatal shot. There are a plethora of other whys, whats and whos that still need answering and this film does not come close. But it does deliver on its promise to plausibly identify who fired the fatal shot, so four stars for that.",1441497600,,2108,5.1759530791788855

5854662,5,B00DT55OBI,"If you want to watch a documentary that gives a logical, fascinating theory and explanation about what happened to President Kennedy in 1963, then watch this documentary.  If you already have a lot of interest and knowledge about this event and you're a logical-thinking, reasonable person, after watching this you will probably connect all the dots in a logical, reasonable way and realize that the Kennedy ""assassination"" was an accident.  It was also a conspiracy, but a different kind of conspiracy other than the countless conspiracy theories that are out there, such as the CIA, LBJ, Nixon, Castro, the Russians, the Mafia, etc., etc., etc.  The conspiracy was after the fact, rather than pre-planned.  Why did the Secret Service and FBI act the way they did after the shooting, at Parkland Hospital in Dallas, at Bethesda Naval Hospital in Maryland, etc.?  I don't want to give away too much.  Watch the documentary to see for yourself.

Now, of course, there are still a lot of unanswered questions out there that have been lingering for decades, and I don't blame anyone for still questioning a lot of things (I still do myself).  But if you approach this documentary with an open mind, you might be swayed.  At the very least, it will open your eyes and realize that this event might have been an accident with a massive coverup after the fact in order to protect the reputation of the Secret Service.  How many shots did Oswald fire according to this documentary?  Watch to find out.

It is very possible that Oswald's second shot (the shot known infamously as The Magic Bullet) would not have been fatal.  It is very possible that Kennedy could have survived that wound.  I've always believed in the single bullet theory.  I've always believed that one bullet could cause seven wounds.  It has even been proven in several experiments on documentaries I've watched.  But what I've always questioned FOREVER is the head shot.  Why did the head explode the way it did?  It's so obvious that the head shot came from a different type of gun, a bullet that was designed to explode on impact.  A bullet from Oswald's rifle could not have caused such an explosion and massive injury.

So, if this documentary's theory about how Kennedy was killed turns out to be actually true (and I believe that it is), then the history books need to be re-written and amended.  The history book have always said the following:

John F. Kennedy's cause of death was by assassination.

The history books would have to be amended to say:

John F. Kennedy's cause of death was by friendly fire from a Secret Service agent who was responding to an assassination attempt by an individual who was later captured and identified as Lee Harvey Oswald.

Thus, that would mean that the last U.S. President to be officially assassinated by definition and beyond any doubt was William McKinley in 1901.",1419033600,,2878,4.798780487804878
5854663,5,B00DT55OBI,"JFK: The Smoking Gun is a fascinating look into what probably happened with the Kennedy assassination. While extremely tragic and sad, the most logical theory is the one generated by this program, and that being that a Secret Service agent accidentally fired his gun, striking President Kennedy. I've always believed that Oswald fired shots, and this program validates this theory clearly. One of Oswald's shots struck Kennedy and Governor Connelly, upholding the ""magic bullet"" theory, only that this time (with a different seating configuration) the bullet is a straight trajectory, rather than the meandering one that the Warren Commission proposed. Probably the most disturbing part of the investigation depicted on this program are the actions of the Secret Service right after the assassination; their overwhelming presence and nervousness and intimidation tactics spell coverup all the way. Yes, accidentally killing the President of the United States is embarrassing, but their honor was disintegrated that day. One will never know if Oswald's shot would've killed Kennedy anyway, but it's easy to see either scenario. I've never been onboard with CIA conspiracy, grassy knolls, third gunman, or even LBJ behind the assassination. This DVD gives the most realistic account of what really happened on November 22, 1963.

Check it out.",1418083200,,326,4.637931034482759
5854666,5,B00DT55OBI,"I'm the type of person who needs strong evidence to prove whether something happened or not. Especially something of great magnitude. I didn't believe  the JFK assassination was the result of a conspiracy because, in all my research, I haven't seen incontrovertible evidence to support any of them. I believed Oswald was a lone nut assassin.

When I was younger, and not more open-minded (just more stupid), I went through a phase when I believed one conspiracy theory after another, each one more outlandish. I even believed Oliver Stone's preposterous fairy tale, ""JFK"". This, of course, was before I researched some of the major characters in the film, and before I became a reasoned skeptic, basing my judgments on critical thinking.

Being a skeptic and critical thinker does not mean I don't have an open mind. It means that the more extraordinary the claim, the more extraordinary the evidence has to be in order to prove it, at least to me. I wish more people had this standard. It would solve many of our societal problems.

I noticed ""JFK: The Smoking Gun"" on Netflix because it has such high ratings, 5 stars. So I decided to give it a chance. When I realized the movie was heading off into conspiracy territory, I became disappointed and almost turned it off. But I made myself watch it just to see what little evidence the filmmaker presented in support of his theory.

I never thought I'd say this but, this film has changed my belief that Oswald was the lone gunman. The conspiracy involved is not any that I've ever heard before. The film proves what happened, with solid forensic evidence, and disproves the Warren report and every other conspiracy theory out there.

I've never had my mind changed so fast and drastically about a major historical event, let alone one that occurred during my lifetime. It's absolutely incredible, and even more tragic, the way Kennedy's death actually played out, according to this film. Kennedy survived Oswald's shots, only to be delivered the coup de grce by the people entrusted with protecting him. Then, for the past 50 years, the Secret Service has, ironically, lived up to its name. It's devastating.

If the film is to be believed, the Secret Service is responsible for putting the country through decades of apprehension and distrust, opening the door for one crackpot theory after another, and probably worse, authoring many of them. It would be as titanic a fraud as any of the other conspiracy theories floating around. The major difference here is that it's so simple. No need for complicated and convoluted schemes.

You may ask, well, isn't this just another conspiracy theory? The answer is, absolutely not! The scenario this movie proposes does not require a conspiracy to explain how Kennedy was killed. Perhaps there was a conspiracy of silence after the shooting, but only among a very few individuals.

There will be some who are so closed to any evidence that refutes their pet theory, that this movie will do nothing to dissuade them. One of their favorite arguments is that the fatal shot must have come from the front and not from the back, which the film disproves, because Kennedy's head went back instead of forward. What they are ignorant to is the way a head responds to a hollow-point bullet entering the back and exploding out the front.

When it enters the back, the force is not spread out. It creates a hole just a little larger then the diameter of the bullet. It isn't like being hit in the back of the head with a baseball bat. But when the bullet, in essence, explodes out the front of the head, it follows Newton's Third Law of Motion that, for every action, there is an equal and OPPOSITE reaction! The explosion from the front of the head acted like a little jet engine, causing the head to violently go back. Not only is it common sense, it's common physics.  OK people?

Another issue the conspiracy theorists love to tout is the ""magic bullet"". But this is based on erroneous evidence. The seating configuration of the limousine that they base their argument on is just plain wrong! If you look at the actual way the car's seats were in relationship to each other, there is no need for a ""magic bullet"". All that was necessary, was for a bullet to do what bullets do...go in pretty much a straight line.

""JFK: The Smoking Gun"" presents the one theory, supported by the type of evidence required, that will convince people like me, that our belief that Oswald killed Kennedy was wrong. There will be a lot of angry conspiracy theorists who love their complex and convoluted conspiracies. They will attack this film with intense vitriol, unwilling to let go of long held beliefs, or very profitable ones.

There's an old rule of thumb about finding the answer to a perplexing problem. It's usually the simplest explanation that's the answer to the problem, and the one that makes the most sense. The explanation in this film is simple, and it definitely makes sense. In all other conspiracy theories, hundreds, even thousands of people would've had to have been involved, and stayed silent for 50 years. When's the last time you saw ten people agree on anything, let alone keep a secret. In the simple explanation the movie presents, the cover-up was contained among a very few people in a very tight-knit brotherhood, very much like cops. Remember, this happened in the early 60s. This type of self-protection was rampant within law enforcement then.

This film presents a compelling explanation for what happened in Dealey Plaza on that dreadful day, November 22, 1963. It's because I'm a skeptic, and not very easily convinced of anything without substantial evidence, that I found JFK: The Smoking Gun so compelling and convincing. I would have defended my belief that Oswald was solely responsible for JFK's death til my last breath. This movie has shaken that core belief of mine.",1416960000,4,5882,4.804154302670623

5854681,5,B00DT55OBI,"I just watched this amazing documentary, JFK: The Smoking Gun, on Netflix. This documentary finally proves what really happened on the day John F. Kennedy was assassinated. It's truly sad what took place, and even sadder to know the real truth behind the coverup. If you have Netflix go watch it. I also highly recommend watching it with your family because everyone should know the real truth behind an assassination that destroyed a generation's hopes and dreams. And no, this is not another conspiracy. This is all based on cold hard facts that only ballistics investigating, and witness testimony, can provide.

Seriously, check it out! And if you don't have a Netflix account go purchase a DVD copy on Amazon. It's a bit pricy, $21.05 for a new copy, but it is the definitive answer to the half century question...who killed JFK and why was there such a massive coverup? It all makes logical sense. It's the most perfect explanation as to what happened. All conspiracies can now rest with the truth revealed.

I hope that text books, and history teachers, will use this DVD, and Bonar Menninger's ""Mortal Error"" book, released in 1992, to explain the truth to future generations. The truth should not die again as it did in 1992 when this was all first revealed in Menniger's book that was largely ignored because it didn't reveal some massive conspiracy.

5854683,4,B00DT55OBI,"I've indulged myself with more than my fair share of JFK assassination literature and documentaries. As compelling as some of the evidence is here, it's just one piece of the puzzle.

Here's the scoop. Colin McLaren, an Ausie police detective, approaches the JFK assassination from a purely forensic point of view. He bases his work on the writing of Bonar Menninger who worked the case from a ballistic standpoint. He turns up some surprising information.

As much as I might know about the assassination, most of this was brand new to me. This is due to the fact that no one has really approached it from this angle. The investigative work is tight. He digs deep into records and pulls up names, most of which, I've never heard of. Secret service agent, photographers in the autopsy room, witnesses in Dealy Plaza and more. I find it difficult to argue much of what he says but the kicker is: How much does it matter?

(Spoiler Alert) If, as he contends, Kennedy was accidentally shot by one of his own agents how does that alter the overall reality of what happened. McLaren tries to poo-poo the grassy knoll aspect of the assassination when we have testimony, and film footage, of people running there after the shots were fired because that's where they heard them coming from. Add to that stink surrounding Oswald, the plethora of coincidental deaths after the fact and a host of other things and the mystery is still present.

I gave up on caring who actually pulled the trigger on JFK. Does it matter? Those behind the curtain are the ones I care about.

This is a good entry into the genre but it doesn't wrap the whole case up.",1399939200,5,1637,4.6116838487972505
5854684,2,B00DT55OBI,"I'll give it two stars for entertainment value.  Logic?  It's more a triumph of faith and good intentions.  We'd all like it to be true.

If the only thing you know about the JFK murder is that it's controversial this flick will probably seem an ingeniously convincing solution.  It keeps America clean of conspiracies, salvages the preposterous ""single bullet"" theory, makes the scandalously obvious forgery (and disappearance) of crucial evidence into a hastily improvised PR gesture to spare the Secret Service the shame of...a firearms accident!

The logic Problems arise when you put it into context other evidence.  Only before the thesis is produced does the famous Zapruder film pass the point of the fatal head shot--alleged here to come from 2 cars back in the motorcade.  If that had happened JFK's brain would have been sprayed all over the limousine's other passengers.  The opposite happened.  JFK was slammed back in his seat, the trailing motorcycle cops received the explosion of gore, and the Secret service was seen in the Parkland hospital parking lot sloshing buckets of water over the trunk lid of the limo.  In accepting almost all of the Warren Commission's central conclusions about the assassination the accident theory also assumes nearly all of the W.C.'s vast array of inadequacies and absurdities.  Tacking on an unplanned emergency cover-up deletes very few of them.

Few disbelievers of the official version would contest there was a cover-up.  But even a cursory skeptical analysis of the suspicious and missing evidence the Commission found convincing of Oswald's (sole) guilt shows that much of it was concocted well in advance of the Dallas trip.  (Too much of it to discuss in this space.)

The most interesting thing I'd never seen before was in the video opener: a hand held movie showing the entire crowd at Dealey Plaza rushing en masse down the sidewalk toward the assassination scene and/or the famous grassy knoll.  Against that surge was one lone man in a suit marching stiffly in the in the opposite direction apparently devoid of the least curiousity about events still unfolding behind him.  I think if the video's producers had noticed him he'd have been left on the cutting room floor, since his presence casts a penumbra of doubt on the conspiracy-free theory they proclaim.",1399852800,3,2325,5.057742782152231

5854686,4,B00DT55OBI,"OK, yes it's true, a lot of the material in this documentary came straight out of the book ""Mortal Error"".  It has been supplemented a bit by an Australian ballistics expert who agrees with the book's conclusion.  [spoiler coming].  The proposition put forth by both the book and the movie is that the fatal third shot was not fired by Oswald but by a secret service agent in the car behind the President's car.

If you remember the big scandal about secret service agents about a year ago on a Presidential trip to South America partying all night long including bringing prostitutes to their hotel rooms, then you may not be surprised to hear that a number of the agents that were supposed to be in the motorcade had been up almost all night partying, and were both exhausted and hung over.  And thus an agent whose main job had been moving cars around, ended up in a chaser car because he was fully alert.  When shots were fired, the thesis goes, he saw Oswald's figure in the window, pulled out a semi-automatic rifle, was going to shoot Oswald--but just then the motorcade decided to speed away to avoid more shots.  The car accelerated, the agent lost his balance, and ended up pulling the trigger accidentally, hitting the back of Kennedy's head with a bullet designed to shatter upon impact (unlike all the bullets from Oswald's old rifle, none of which shattered).  The effect destroyed Kennedy's brain.

The agent in question was never called to testify to the Warren Commission.  A head of the Secret Service initially lied about the presence of a rifle in the motorcade, later admitted it but said that it has subsequently been removed from motorcades.  Others testified how they were ordered to falsify an X-ray of Kennedy's head (to make it look like it was pieces of one of Oswald's bullet, and not a different bullet, in his head) and that everyone was told they couldn't say anything at all about the autopsy.  The agent the book (and movie) fingers has never made a statement on record anywhere about what happened.

What this documentary does NOT answer are questions like: Why did Oswald try to shoot the President, and why did Jack Ruby shoot Oswald?  What it does do, fairly convincingly I think, is demonstrate that Oswald did not fire the final, fatal shot.  Some argue it could not have been that particular agent, but the evidence presented seems compelling that the shot at least came from behind the President, in the vicinity of the chaser car, and was a different type of bullet.  Friendly fire, it seems....

5854693,3,B00DT55OBI,"There is only one redeeming quality of the movie. How could Oswald fire intact bullets and the bullet that struck President Kennedy be an exploding bullet (metal fragments lodged in his brain) as opposed to intact bullets that struck JFK and Connelly earlier.

Besides that, all of the material, is based upon the book ""Mortal Error"". That writer spent 25 years studying the case; while the star of the show from Australia spent 5. The star doesn't do anything in particular, except for looking up and around in Dealey Plaza. Presumably he was brought into the movie because he had some legitimacy as a Australian forensic attorney.

But the part that is really a stretch, and is a stretch in ""Mortal Error,"" is the accidental shooting by a fresh new Secret Security agent of the fatal JFK head shot.

I have watched the Zapruder film countless amount of times. HD and slow motion. Clint Hill can be clearly seen jumping on the car after the first shot(s) and before the head shot. Given the angles - posited by the movie and ""Mortal Error"" the shot would have hit Clint Hill and not JFK.

All in all, this movie is a too hyped-up production, that was released just in time for the 50th anniversary. I gave it three-stars because of the reference to ""Mortal Error"" regarding the single exploding bullet. That's something that has never occurred to me.

More reason to believe Oswald didn't act alone. But less reason to believe a Secret Security agent accidentally did it.

P.S. The Secret Security wasn't the ones pushing to have the autopsy moved from Dallas. Instead it was JFK's closet aids Kenny  O'Donnell and Dave Powers. Counter to the Secret Security autopsy manipulation, it was in fact, ordered and administered by Bobby Kennedy.",1391385600,2,1740,4.78
5854694,5,B00DT55OBI,"On the surface it seems farfetched, but JFK 's assassination could have happened this way.  In the chaos and confusion of the moment, why couldn't a Secret Service agent's gun have gone off accidentally?  The explosion of Kennedy's head seems to suggest that it was caused by a frangible bullet--the kind of bullet that was used in the S S agent's automatic weapon.  The theory was presented in a clear and understandable way, the experts were knowledgeable, and the computer graphics were excellent.  You may not go along with the theory, but it sure is a fascinating and very well done program.",1391040000,10,596,4.813725490196078
5854695,5,B00DT55OBI,"However, the Secret Service had immediately destroyed crucial evidence which began with their forcing the Presidents body out of Parkland Hospital.  As author David S. Lifton suggests in his book, ""Best Evidence,""  tampering with the body, the best evidence in any homicide, may have already occurred on Air Force 1; for sure at Bethesda.  This documentary does a great job pointing to the '2nd gunman,' SS Agent George Hickey.  The question is:  was it accidental as the movie implies?  Or was it intentional?  Either way, there was definitely a cover up.",1390176000,2,556,5.043956043956044
5854696,1,B00DT55OBI,"Based on the work of Howard Donahue and Bonar Menninger. The book, Mortal Error, was useful for its information about firearms, and the confirmation that the head shot clearly was not produced by a Carcano rifle. Otherwise, the theory - that Secret Service agent George Hickey stood up and accidentally shot Kennedy with an automatic rifle - is absurd.

The film taken by Charles Bronson from Main Street shows the Secret Service follow-up car just before the head shot, and enhanced frames show that no one in the car is standing. And if Hickey had somehow managed to fire over the heads of four people in the car without anyone noticing, surely everyone on Elm Street would have noticed an AR-15 going off. But not one witness did.

A lengthier debunking of this theory can be found on Pat Speer's site.

Menninger & Donahue mostly accept the official medical/ballistics evidence (such as the single bullet theory), which is bogus. They simply dismiss the multitude of witnesses who saw a large hole blown out of the right-rear of JFK's head. Many people at the Bethesda autopsy saw this as well, but the HSCA managed to misrepresent their testimony. So they are basing their conclusions on bad evidence. They also claim that JFK's throat wound would have been fatal anyway, which is simply nonsense.

The premise is already totally wrong because it begins with the false assumption that Oswald killed Kennedy (and that has not been established yet, regardless of the corrupt Warren Commission report wants us all to believe).  The other thing it does is, because it is assuming that Oswald did the killing (totally disregarding countless witnesses and records of people claiming they saw a puff of smoke from the knoll area and heard shots from there) and that the shots came from behind the president.  This despite the fact that he was clearly hit from the front and the bullet exploded in the back of his scull.  Ok...now once you get past that foolishness, now this so-called ballistics ""expert"" wants us all to believe that a Secret Service guy did it on accident.  I mean....if I wasn't so pissed, and disgusted I might have laughed at such idiocy.  Yeah so everything else is just hundreds of coincidences, right?  Wow.  This is a waste of time and money.
