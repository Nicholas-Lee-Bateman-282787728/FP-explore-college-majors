8241382,5,B0011D1PZY,"This movie is phenomenonal. Clive Barker and his team should've been nominated for Oscars. This picture is phenomenonally written, Virginia Madsen is undeniably outstanding along with her supportive cast. The now demolished Cabrini Green homes standout as a never forgotten Hell Hole that inspired many great writers to write about the horrors of this low income poverty striken complex. I  myself grew up in such hell hole, and this film inspires me to never look back to my past. I love this film and love the team, Tony Todd and Virginia Madsen are hot hot hot in thier memorable performances. The sequel and third film suck!!!,Hollywood's way of making more revenue,  but this is the original that is a must buy and see!!!!.",1433635200,,728,4.9105691056910565
