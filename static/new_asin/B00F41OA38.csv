5967355,5,B00F41OA38,Best children's show ever. Reminds kids to play outside and use their big imaginations! My kids love this inventive show.,1402617600,,121,5.1
5967356,5,B00F41OA38,"My little one can't get enough of this show. We watch it daily on the Sprout channel. Have even managed to sock away 50 episodes on the DVR, and while that can play multiple episodes on auto play, you do have about 10 minutes of Nina and Star and commercials to contend with. The DVD you just play all episodes and it'll roll through about an hour, keeping my soon-to-be three year old giggling and dreaming. Will be grabbing the rest on DVD as they come available.",1393545600,5,465,4.35632183908046
8612198,5,B00F41OA38,"Our son fell in love with the Stella and Sam shows when he was very young (<2yrs). They are still some of his favorites now that he is 4 years old. The shows are so imaginative and creative.  Reflects how I grew up -- playing made up games OUTSIDE.
So glad that the DVDs are available.  NOTE:  This DVD has 6 shows on it.  Enjoy!",1516492800,,329,4.015384615384615
8612199,5,B00F41OA38,"We love Stella and Sam in this household! We had watched Season One episodes online but hadn't found any from Season Two. This DVD gave us multiple - with the bonus episode, Shipwrecked. Excellent production and as an added bonus, the episodes can also be watched in French (my daughter loves this). I'd recommend this imaginative, fun, and gentle series and DVD to everyone.",1506038400,,375,4.875

8612201,5,B00F41OA38,"I usually never write reviews but Stella and Sam deserves my effort. This is the best show for young kids I've ever come across. It's endearing, creative, friendly, engaging for kids AND adults, not annoying (that's rare! Lol) and... The biggie...  nothing scary. I have a SUPER timid 5 year old and nearly every scene of 'drama' in Disney movies or even the most docile kids show sends her into anxiety mode. Not Stella and Sam. It's just cute quips, sweet interactions between siblings, funny jokes, and imagination galore. I actually love this show. How many kids TV shows can parents really say don't get on their last nerve? Not many. Try it, you can't go wrong here. I hope many more episodes continue to crank out.",1474156800,4,721,4.677165354330708
8612202,5,B00F41OA38,Son loves this series and the dvd is great. Just wish there were more AND that they weren't so pricey for a cartoon.,1470614400,,116,4.086956521739131
8612203,5,B00F41OA38,"Can't help but LOVE this show. Creative, simple, easy to watch. I think our boys wished they could meet the cast. My oldest 3 year old almost acts out/ pretending with his toys the whole story all over again. Clean and have shared with others how Canada is taking the lead in child friendly back to fun and creative shows. Using imagination is such a lost art due to technology yet, we are watching the show kids get excited to DO.",1449532800,,431,4.333333333333333
8612204,5,B00F41OA38,Always entertaining!,1431734400,,20,9.5
8612205,5,B00F41OA38,"Great DVD and even though it's not clear in some areas (drawings get grainy), it still a good DVD. Has 7 episodes: Fredland, Spider Games, Dragonflies, Pirates, How The West Was Fun, and the bonus episode Shipwreaked. I picked this particular DVD because Owen is in a lot of the episodes and he adds a little more fun to Sam and Stella's adventures. Run time 73 min. Also has French setting.",1424217600,15,391,4.52112676056338
8612206,5,B00F41OA38,"This is a great series for young children. Stella, the big sister, is always coming up with new and creative ways to make every day life adventurous for her little brother Sam. Her imagination is endless. This is a very calm show without all the loud annoying sounds of most. BTW...this is my 3yr old's favorite show of all time. He really loves it and it is his reward after he finishes his ""school work"". ;) This DVD shipped fast and actually has 6 episodes on it, making it well worth the money spent.",1422921600,,504,4.372340425531915
8612207,5,B00F41OA38,Best toddler tv series ever!! A must buy if you have little ones. My 2(almost 3) year old loves Stella & Sam. We have watched this countless times. Also have some of the books.,1418342400,,176,4.205882352941177
