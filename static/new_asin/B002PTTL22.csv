3965913,3,B002PTTL22,"As Nazis were an evil force in the world when alive, they certainly notch it up as cinematic monsters! Without a doubt, DEAD SNOW features the best Nazi Zombies that I have seen. Unfortunately the film is not without its flaws, such as there is virtually no explanation as to what caused the ""Zombification""; and of the old timer who warned our group of victims to stay away, (though he did not take his own sage advice). Also, the Nazi uniforms showed little wear despite the fact that the flesh within showed advanced signs of rot and decay. The white Nazi winter army outfit still sparkled, for example. Nonetheless, this is a fun ride that features some very nice looking Zombies, even though they are ""Snyder runners"" for the most part. There was also some inventive kills that will delight even the most ardent Gorehounds. On another note, I am confused that many regard this as a comedy. There is a large segment of the movie going public that has some rather inexplicable opinions as to what constitutes ""humour"" in a movie. Indeed, many ""Horror"" film fans seem to thrive on any shred of humour as an excuse to laugh, as though that is now an  obligatory response to a Horror film. In contrast, that would be like crying while watching comedy. As discussed in some of my other Zombie film reviews, humour dilutes the element of Horror and only in the most skilled hands does it even lend itself to the making of a Horror film. DEAD SNOW does feature some of those nubile-hormone driven young 'uns who say and do stupid things at the most inappropriate time, (though it is supposed to be funny). Such footage does not add to the ""creep factor"", though I've learned to ignore such lest I never watch another modern Horror film again. Yes, DEAD SNOW does flirt with that senseless element, and as a result it stumbles at times. It is NOT a comedy, though. That said, DEAD SNOW has a lot going for it, including one helluva looking Zombie, the dead SS Leader, who was the star of the film. The production values are also quite high, and helped to make the film a joy to watch. Yes, I would have preferred a darker, more psychological approach, and thought that the Zombies received over exposure towards the end of the picture, (can't believe I said that), but we can't have everything. I prefer DEAD SNOW to SHOCK WAVES, (a film that some regard as the ""gold standard"" of Nazi Zombie cinema), as it brings the genre up to date. Though not without flaws, DEAD SNOW is a reasonably well made motion picture and I feel that it is recommended viewing for all Zombie film fans!",1259712000,3,2577,4.553879310344827

in other movies....and this is some of the same....drink ...love...stupid lines...
a little sex...blah blah blah....but wait a second..this is a zombie movie...and
yes once they start appearing it give extra quality to the film, as they are
mean, angry , ugly and they are Nazis........A big plus to the commandant of the
Nazis...he is evil and scary.
  And also, in this film, everyone had to work extra hard,,,why...ha...they have
to run in the snow.  Ever tried to run a long time in the snow...its pretty hard.
All the zombies have to run, but the makeup jobs is soo good that it all looks good.  Also, yes there is a great deal of gore and blood...but well done.

Funny? Yes!
Character development? Excellent!
Script? Sweet!
So what's the problem? American viewers either can't read subtitles fast enough with full comprehension, or those that do tend to have their noses too high in the air to see the subtitles of this film! Since few people have the equipment to watch this movie on video, almost everyone who has seen this flick has seen it on the big screen, and hasn't had the ability to continuously replay the various scenes and catch everything. See it with someone who speaks the language and watch them laugh their tails off.  Come on! An ace medical student with a blood phobia? that alone is the plot for a movie but add a bunch of zombie nazis, deciliters of beer and a  rickety outhouse and you have the makings of a  campy five star movie called Dead Snow  (or as my wife calls it, Snow Nazis!) I'm not going to go into the the plot as thats covered in the other reviews. And as is typical with most European movies, it isn't a brain dead flick that writes everything out for you like the insipid trash that comes out of Hollywood. You do need to pay attention to the movie. There is no single scene that explains it all. It requires the use of some intellect. This alone makes it a cut above most zombie movies. Make no mistake, this is NOT a highbrow movie, but it isn't Return of the Living Dead either!. If you are a fan of  Zombie movies it IS a must see. While it is  violent,and gory, it doesn't depend soley on special effects. It is an EXCELLENT piece of cinema, considering the genera",1256342400,2,1558,4.411149825783972
3965917,3,B002PTTL22,"""Dead Snow"" is a Norwegian comedy horror film, directed by Tommy Wirkola. In the film a group of medical students take a holiday in the mountains at an isolated cabin. They're meeting a friend who is traveling cross country, but she never makes it. In the hills, lying in wait, are the dead from WWII. We never really learn how these Nazis became zombies, but they're out for revenge on anyone who disturbs their burial grounds. ""Dead Snow"" will make you jump, and at times chuckle. It's campy fun, and the Nazis zombie's look great.",1256083200,9,533,4.621052631578947
3965918,4,B002PTTL22,"Dd Sn (Tommy Wirkola, 2009)

I'm sure that everyone who reads my reviews on a fairly regular basis has heard me talk about the Nazi Zombie subgenre, since I've been a fan of it for decades. So I'll skip the usual declaiming and just note in passing that Tommy Wirkola's second feature-length directorial outing, Dd Sn (released in English as Dead Snow), is a Nazi Zombie movie, and actually it's gotten the biggest push of any Nazi Zombie movie I'm aware of since the early eighties. I should also note that Wirkola's first movie, Kill Buljo, was a Norwegian parody of Kill Bill; that should tell you that this is not a movie you should take seriously; it's a lot more Oasis of the Dead than it is Shock Waves. I'm certainly not going to complain about that. Nazi Zombies are equally good whether they're played straight or funny.

As far as plot goes, this is pretty straight out of the Nazi Zombie stockpile. You've got a cast of young-and-beautifuls who are out for a holiday. You've got the slightly mad old dude who warns them that the place they're in is not really fit for human habitation (one wonders why he's there, then). And you've got hordes of German World War II veterans, all dead, all walking around, and all wanting to kill you and devour your flesh. And, I should note, all very well-coutured. It's amazing, in Nazi Zombie movies, how the flesh inside the uniforms rots, but the uniforms themselves stay so spiffy. They just don't make 'em like that any more!

In any case, if you're a Nazi Zombie fan, this one's a must-see no matter how awful it is. After all, there may be quite a few NZ movies out there, but not so many that hardcore fans of the genre haven't seen them all a score of times. Any new addition is welcome. Thankfully, Dd Sn, while certainly flawed, is a great deal of fun. (You halfway expect the big twist at the end, but it's so visually stunning that it just doesn't matter.) It's meta in the way so many post-Scream horror films have been, well aware of the conventions of the genre and as willing to discuss them as to flaunt them (or pay homage to them). I know that a lot of horror fans have gotten tired of that sort of thing, but I think that when it's done right, it's witty; it works for me here as well as it has anywhere else. Wirkola's humor, once it really kicks into gear, goes way over the top. If that sort of thing bothers you (read: if you didn't like the ""send more cops!"" line in Return of the Living Dead), you're probably going to like this movie a lot less than I did. But I got quite a few good belly laughs out of this, which is kind of rare in horror movies these days.

Very enjoyable. Even if you're not an established NZ fan, it's worth checking out. Not as your first NZ movie; there will never be anything to top Shock Waves as the genre's gold standard. But you should definitely make it your second. *** ",1254268800,3,2878,4.351955307262569
3965919,4,B002PTTL22,"This highly anticipated film delivers even on the shoulders of other films. The most obvious is the storyline coming from John Carpenter's The Fog. Instead of pirates coming back to life to reclaim their treasure it is the German army. But this film is all about paying tribute and adding it's own brand of style and fun. Whether it is as obvious as the plot devices or the bizarrre sex scene which sums up a lot of oddly placed sex situations in horror movies. The film still manages some good shocks and creative gory moments, not to mention some great camera work.  You can see the ending coming a mile away but it is still a very entertaining movie.",1254268800,,653,4.487394957983193
3965920,4,B002PTTL22,"Dead Snow is an ultra-bloody and campy Norwegian horror film that had a limited U.S. release on June 19, 2009.  It opened to mixed reviews amongst renowned (cough!) critics but I found it an inspirational and grandiose piece of cinema.  Kidding of course, but there is plenty here to like for you demented horror fans.

Here's the basic setup--a group of friends embark on an Easter vacation at a snowy and secluded cabin near Oksfjord.  This includes a little snowmobile riding, drinking, Twister, and a little outhouse sex action...ahh yes, good times!  Except of course they aren't alone out there in the sticks.
A mysterious hiker stops by their cabin, clueing them in on the sordid and violent history of the region.  After suffering ruthless torture and abuse at the hands of some Nazis, the citizens banded together and drove them into the mountains.  Those wicked soldiers were thought to be frozen dead in the snow.  Well, that theory isn't completely true.

Dead Snow pays homage to (or rips off) countless other zombie flicks.  The original splash of blood is injected with a swastica and a smile.  Gotta love dem Nazis!  The killings start off with a fairly serious tone--some brutal and messy human devourage that is sure to make you squirm.  Then the silliness slowly starts to kick in.  Eventually it goes full throttle campy campin' madness!
Hordes of zombies running with swords and chomping.  Witness them getting chainsawed in half or mowed down by a machinegun mounted on the snowmobile.  Flesh rippage, eye gouging, decapitations, entrails removal, and lots of blood spatter.  It's over the top and in your face--gotta love it!

There are some minor things that might dissuade some viewers though.  Not much character development, along with a basic, overused storyline.  A couple of the kills take place at night, and the poor lighting makes it somewhat hard to follow.  The acting is perfunctory at best, but nobody should expect much for this type of story anyway.  Also, the most damnable flaw--no nudity?  Almost a worse crime than not counting votes.

All-in-all, Dead Snow snowballs about every other zombie flick on the current market.  Highly recommended to fans of zany horror comedy!

3965921,5,B002PTTL22,"Yes this is it. This is the best horror film I've seen in years.
To describe this movies there need a few words only.

NAZIS, BLOOD, SNOW, ZOMBIE.

You will be crazy about this movie if you are even watching horror films from time to time.
You will be horrofied by Zombie nazies just looking at them coming.
They are so powerful to look at. The images are so so scary.
When a bunch of them are coming near you, you will cry out loud the name of god for sure. This is a really amazing film.

The beginning was kind of a crap.
A bunch of guys and gilrs going on a trip to snowy cabin. Have heard a thousand times ha?
But they meets this man who tells them story about the place that this place is the most brutal areal where Nazi's used to conqured and did all kinds of inhumane things to them-Norway people. They kind of freaked out.
Then he got killed by someone.
When one of the girl was in the bathroom which is separated from the main cabin, she saw some strange creature like figure looking at her.
Then she dissapears.
Next day they all see a bunch of Zombie Nazis after all.
They try to kill them all and suck their blood.
They are so real and so so scary.
You never have seen anything like them before.
This was such a big hit at the boxoffice that they even made the volum 2. Also the director comes to Hollywood and makes the movie <Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters>. He is also making another Hollywood film now. It's in production.",1466640000,,1440,4.172661870503597
3965922,2,B002PTTL22,"There are many reviews here so I'll just throw in a few observations.

Even for 'what it is' I didn't think it was all that great. When it comes down to it, the movie really wasn't that original nor that entertaining. The Nazi's were there just for window dressing and shock value. But really, it's just another zombie movie that just  happens to have Nazi soldiers as zombies. It wouldn't make much of a difference to the plot of the movie if the zombies were formerly guys named Tom, Dick or Harry.

There is nothing original about the plot and it is quite ordinary. Just your standard 'young people holed up in the mountains' scenario. You also get your creepy guy from the woods with warnings of doom.

I think the director's is very obsessed with entrails being pulled all over the place. This was done too many times and lost it's shock value.

Also, the movie is just a bit over the top in too many places, especially the second half of the movie as it loses all pretense of being believable.

All in all, no better than average for the genre.

Recommended for Nazi horror fans only.",1461542400,,1090,4.447236180904523

3965974,4,B002PTTL22,"Dead Snow

 This is a surprisingly fine little movie, in spite of the stark title.  When a Zombie fan has a chance to watch a Norwegian made, sub-titled Nazi Zombie flick he, as Yogi Berea said about the fork in the road, should take it.  It warms ones heart to see in far off, snow clad Norway, a man like writer/director Tommy Wirkola who can make a main line Zombie flick with as much impact, gore and honesty as this one.  As the jacket notes claim (possibly written by Tommy himself) this movie is perhaps the finest Nazi Zombie movie of our time.  I won't call him wrong.  In 2013 he directed the successful mainstream Hollywood film Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters.
 This is a classic film in every respect.  All the conventions are honored here with no sly winks or tongue in cheek business.  This is a real deal, main line Zombie film.
 A group of young med students equally mixed between males and females, take off for the wilds of Norways mountains.  We know right away that there will be trouble because the uber athletic Sara skis into the mountain cabin alone while the rest of the party goes in by car and for the last stretch, by foot.  We watch Sara being chased down by Zombies before the titles go up.  It is a very well done scene with an exhausted Sara fleeing through the drifts while relentless, tireless, Zombies close in.  Even the death scene is tastefully filmed at long distance.  We are left with a sense of loss rather than grossed out by an up close and personal dismemberment.
 The Norwegian youngsters play around with American movie icons, quoting everyone from Homer Simpson to The Govenator, so we know they are hip.  We know what they do not, that they- like Sara-are doomed.  A scary stranger tries to warn them of the dangers in the mountains with a weird and disturbing tale of Nazi nastiness in WWII, but they are young and carefree, heedless of his odd warning.
 Viewer warning: there is a sexual encounter between two of the students disgustingly set in the only private place they could find, the out house.
 But once that is out of the way, real mayhem begins.  In a deliberate wave of ambiguity, the script never explains how or why the defeated remnant of the German army was turned into the undying dead.  They just appear, apparently they have been waiting for 70 years for some students to stop by and be devoured.  I like that.  It is more pure and traditional and much less rational than some other modern scripts.
 I have not had much experience with Norwegians.  I expect them to be interchangeable with other Europeans and be sort of soft and squishy like Frenchmen.  Not these kids.  The boys and girls alike take the fight to the enemy with a vengeance.  These are some of the very best human vs. Zombie hand to hand fighting ever filmed.  One of the girls stomps a Zombie to mush and slush.  They shoot Zombies, decapitate Zombies and generally do them in by the car load, and in very personal ways to boot.  There are a lot of Zombies however, and no matter how heroic the students are, their numbers gradually dwindle is spectacular splashes of blood and innards.
 This was my first Norwegian film of any sort and I enjoyed it very much.  It is R rated and runs for an almost exactly average 92 minutes.  This sub-titled movie brings in a solid three brains.",1413072000,,3320,4.50251256281407

3965976,3,B002PTTL22,"A group of medical students decide to take a vacation in a secluded cabin located in the snowy mountains of Norway. The boozing, games, and sex begins, and the group are having a great time. One of their number, a girl named Sara (Ane Dahl Torp) decided to trek the snowy terrain solo to meet them but she never shows up. Her boyfriend Vegard (Lasse Valdel) becomes worried and decides to go look for her the following morning. His friends back in the cabin are soon viciously attacked by a very blood thirsty group, and they soon arm themselves to fend off their aggressive attackers. -summary

Dead Snow is one of those types of man vs. the undead zombie romps I had to be in a specific mood to watch. The zombie comedies are far away from my cup of tea, and when I first saw this movie years ago some of the things going on managed to put me off kind of badly. In all honesty I never truly disliked the movie, but after yesterday's re-watch in a different frame of mind I enjoyed it a lot more.

Directed by Tommy WirKola, Dead Snow proudly proclaims to be one of the 25 best zombie films of all time. This really isn't something to brag about though, simply due to their being so much garbage out there. However, Dead Snow really is among the better of its type.

The film begins well enough with a dark chase leading to a very predictable outcome, and it soon fast forwards to the group of would be victims. Wirkola knows how to bring the audience into his world and set them up for something special. The film gradually builds up in suspense with a few kills left up to the imagination, but when I first saw this I knew something huge was coming when taking into account the various Evil Dead and Braindead references. Eventually Dead Snow reveals its more sadistic edge making a case that it may be able to stand up to Braindead in regards to sheer violence and gore.

Dead Snow is no slouch at all in the gore department; the viewer will get some really insane kills, and this movie was still able to shock me with some things, and this is taking under consideration the carnage found in Braindead aka Dead Alive. However, Dead Snow does not exactly come close to the aforementioned film when speaking of violence and gore; yet I enjoy it quite a bit more due to its lack of reliance on heavy  slapstick.

Dead Snow does have a dark comedic edge but its not as over the top as it could have been, which is a good thing for me when considering my disdain for horror comedy. There's an even balance here that held my attention and it never felt forced like Dead Alive. However the film gets on my nerves in ways; the comedy present does create a certain tonal shift that pretty much betrays the serious minded viewer in light of how serious the film began. There are some moments that straight out drag to the point of annoyance, and the characters just hanging around in a hostile environment as if everything was over grated on my nerves. It also makes the mistake of creating an obvious plot hole; for example, the zombies are portrayed as being super strong to the point where they send the protagonists flying several feet and even ripping them apart, and they even portray super speed; however they come off average in one on one fights and can't even take down two guys or two women. Why over power them so much in the beginning only to take a power dive mid-way through the film?

Dead Snow has a very nice snow laden setting in the mountains which works very well into the atmosphere, as the viewer will know quickly this is all about survival for the campers, and the chance of rescue is non existent. The make up work for the zombies is done well enough despite a lack of variety, but this is all forgotten when looking at the gore. Some of these deaths shouldn't be spoiled with details, just watch the movie if you want some blood.

Plot holes and tonal inconsistency aside, Dead Snow isn't exactly a bad zombie movie unless you absolutely need your horror to be serious to the core. Now for those whom don't fall into that category and they simply want some thoughtless slaughter, then Dead Snow delivers the goods in that category; mutilations, decapitations, intestines hanging out, yes, this is what you get  when coming into Dead Snow. Enjoy.

Pros:  Lots of gore, some creepy moments

Cons: Some tedious moments, plot holes for the sake of entertainment",1412294400,,4378,4.46558197747184

3965978,3,B002PTTL22,"I saw Dead Snow and its sequel, Dead Snow 2 (Red vs Dead) in reverse order.  The original is entertaining enough as yer fairly standard Nazi-zombie movie, though if this isn't your genre (it's usually not mine) you probably won't find it appealing.  It's amusing in places and very well done overall.  But the sequel is a very, very different matter: Dead Snow 2 (which my wife and I saw at a midnight showing in Seattle during the 2014 Film Festival) was the funniest movie I've seen in ages.  Brilliantly scripted, totally camp, and laugh-out-loud funny for much of its length.  I expected something similarly brilliant and inspired from the original, but it's just not there.

3965981,5,B002PTTL22,"This is, without a doubt, my favorite Norwegian zombie movie.
Loosely based on the draugen folktales, the plot involves Nazis who were killed for robbing and terrorizing the people who lived in and around Oksfjord.  Ever since then, the Nazi undead have been on the lookout for their missing loot, seeking to reclaim it wherever it's found.  In this case, part of their `treasure' is in a box beneath the cabin of a woman, Sara, who's waiting to meet a few friends there for Easter vacation.  The hostess doesn't show up but her 7 friends do.  Before you can say, having an outhouse is a really bad downgrade in a vacation home; the bodies start to pile up.  This film is equal parts humorous and horrifying.  I liked it for its audacity and style, choosing to ignore its lack of originality.  It is, after all, just another variation of a slasher/splatter flick where a group of people are isolated in a cabin and picked off one by one.  There's also the obligatory creepy guy who reveals the history of the area to the unsuspecting campers.  This film also relies heavily on jump scares (very effective but not entirely original).  I did love the use of Grieg's In the Hall of the Mountain King during the opening sequence.  I also love that one of the characters, Roy, picks up a hammer and sickle to attack the Nazi zombie horde (very ironic).  I've watched this movie twice, listening to the original Norwegian language with English subtitles.  It is incredibly fun and has a prominent place in my collection.  (I purchased it based entirely on the cover art on the DVD and I'm glad I took the chance.  It's a great `find.')

The director/writer of Dead Snow, Tommy Wirkola, also wrote and directed Hanzel and Gretel: Witch Hunters.  He is also involved in making the sequels to both films.

For those not in the know, a second one is coming out called Dead Snow: Red vs. Dead this year. I'm looking forward to that! Who doesn't enjoy some good comedy with their gore?

No it's not in English, you may have to read subtitles or listen to the dubbed version (which isn't bad). I just hope and pray they never make an Americanized version. Leave the foreign films alone! If you enjoy overdone gore, contrived comedy, and Nazi Zombies (who doesn't?) then pick this one up. Done on a million budget, director Tommy Wirkola turned this into a cult hit.

This film was pretty original while at the same time being cheesy and predictable. The film starts off very slow and tediously boring. The mood is set for a more creepy horror style in the tradition of Friday the 13th in a slowly predictable series of events. Then after about an hour it just gets excessively gory and (strangely) rather slapstick and humorous at the same time. The Nazi zombies in this film break all the rules. They punch, bite, kick, stab, and even watch you through binoculars. Yep, you heard that right, THROUGH BINOCULARS!! LOL! The film is actually pretty well acted and you can tell that the crew who shot this have an eye for serious movie making. The film reviels earlier on that the people behind the scenes know a thing or two about film making. The over all quality of the production doesn't seem like amature stuff. Once the zombies come and the fountains of blood and guts start exploding in your face the film gets totally different and pretty wild. Fountains of blood, flying heads, trails of guts and flying body parts begin to mount up all the way to the blood spattered gloriously gory-isly end.

The makeup effects were great, and the plot was entertaining, but the drawback for me was that the filmmakers seemed to dither between making a serious film and making a horror-comedy. I really enjoyed it, just wish they'd sort of stuck with one concept or the other. I'd say the target audience for this film might have enjoyed ""George A.

Now, they bare the wrath of the undead as the Nazi foot soldiers come back from beneath the mountain to reclaim their stolen treasure! Tommy Wirkola's cult-sensation, DEAD SNOW, immediately sets the tone with its frequent genre references and familiar settings. Sam Raimi's unmistakable influence and signature form of splatstic humor is clearly felt in every moment. Unlike the many other homages to THE EVIL DEAD, however, DEAD SNOW stays fresh, fast-paced, and exciting, while scoring big points in the make-up department with several winning zombie designs and a slew of ridiculously gory gags that shock as much as they entertain. Whatever shortcomings exist in the plot or characters are more than made up for in mindless carnage, making DEAD SNOW a real treat for gore fans.

They have a good time and seem to have no problem with the odd house in the freezing cold. While at the cabin, the proverbial visitor warns them they should not disturb the evil in the hills as legends of WWII German soldiers still roam the mountains.

I think we know where this is headed, unless you got a DVD without any cover art. The dialouge was pretty good, with some humor and dark humor. The zombies were not the foot dragging variety, but moved rather quickly and with some forethought. The soundtrack was excellent ranging from classical to European industrial. The cabin aspect brought back memory flashes from ""The Evil Dead"" plus the fact they mentioned it in the film. The blood and guts effects bordered on Troma style. It was comical to watch a brain fall out of a victims head...sorry I laughed.

I bought the 2-disc version at my local Walmart for $9.96. It defaults to Norwegian language and English subtitles. I watched it in English with English subtitles. The spoken English was a bit hipper than the written subtitles which appeared to be more of a word for word translation without bothering to create a loose feel. Great entertainment. I wished they had reused the classical music somewhere in the final scenes, which they had opened the film with, bringing us full circle. I don't know if I would place this in the top 25 zombie films as the cover claims. It it did make that list, it would be nearer to 25 than to number 1. But then again, I watch a lot of zombie films.

3966030,4,B002PTTL22,"Much like Fido, Zombieland & Zombie Dearest before it; Dead Snow is one of those zombie movies that's uniquely fun to watch and extremely funny. Dead Snow is a 2009 Norwegian zombie comedy directed by Tommy Wirkola, that stars Charlotte Frogner, Stig Frode Henriksen, Bjrn Sundquist, Ane Dahl Torp and Jenny Skavlan.

The film involves a group of students trying survive a zombie attack in the mountains of Norway. It begins with a woman being chased through the mountain snows of Norway by zombies. Sadly, she is cornered and eaten by the zombies. It then cuts away to seven students on easter vacation arriving at a cabin, owned by the aforementioned woman ,near Oksfjord. The students being to drink, party and sex it up when a mysterious hiker arrives and begins telling them about the history of the region. After he leaves and sets up camp in the mountains, the Hiker hears a noise outside and goes to investigate. He, too, gets attacked and ate by a zombie. Thus begins the tale of Dead Snow.

Entertainment Weekly called Dead Snow--""One of the 25 best zombie movies of all time!"". While I won't go quite that far in saying that, I will say that it is about one of the most entertaining ones I've ever seen. It's quite abit better than some other zombie movies that I've seen that feature nazi as zombies(i.e. Oasis of the Zombies, Outpost).

Dead Snow, however, doesn't tread any new ground. It sticks with the formula so prevelant in zombie movies these days. Course, it works for Dead Snow. The movie does provide a few surprises that you're not expecting.

3966039,4,B002PTTL22,"A group of medical students on holiday encounter undead Nazi soldiers on a mission to kill, in Dead Snow (2009), a nicely paced and well executed horror/comedy, set in the snowy Norwegian wilderness.  The term ""zombie"" probably isn't appropriate, as unlike traditional zombies the soldiers appear to be organized, follow orders, use weapons, do not kill primarily for food, and are also motivated by greed.

Directed by Tommy Wirkola, this Norwegian production is dubbed in English, and features a classic situation, where a co-ed group runs into trouble while lodged at an isolated cabin somewhere deep in the woods.  A strange man (Bjorn Sundquist) appears at the cabin, and tells them that during World War II, the area was occupied by members of an elite SS unit under the command of an officer named Herzog (Orjan Gamst), who abused the people and stole their valuables.  When the tide turned against Germany, the people fought back and drove the soldiers into the mountains, where they presumably perished.  With background information revealed, the undead Nazis soon begin to appear, and chaos and mayhem quickly follows.

Some quirky factors contribute to making Dead Snow a fun and interesting watch.  These include the snowy setting, ruthless undead Nazis, and some creative action scenes and unique kills.  The gore includes dismemberments, chainsaw and axe kills, pulled out intestines, and zombies chopped down by machine gun fire from a snowmobile.  The film's black comedic undertone, often emerges during the action sequences.  Herzog is easily recognizable as the leader, and his SS storm troopers respond quickly to his commands.  The undead are strong, relentless, and display some intelligence, which makes things very tough for the survivors who ferociously battle them in the snow.

The film is well shot, with solid cinematography featuring some impressive snow covered landscapes.  The special effects are not overdone, and what is seen is generally very well done.  There are some nuances that are lost in the translation, but they are probably minor, as the story not that complicated.  While the cast is probably unfamiliar to American audiences, they do a fine job of communicating what was intended.

Although somewhat formulaic, Dead Snow still delivers a few surprises.  Featuring undead Nazis, ample gore, and impressive special effects, the movie is a very fun time, that provides a little different look for horror fans.  Tommy Wirkola is a director to keep an eye on, as his big budget film Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters (2012) is schedule to be released this year.",1326499200,,2603,5.186602870813397

3966045,4,B002PTTL22,"One thing about the zombie monster is that they're pretty much a blank slate and anyone with an idea on how to use them can add their own spin to this undead staple in horror. Some have made zombies be undead Templar knights who hunted by sound. Some have even been made in combination with Egyptian mummies. There has even been zombies underwater fighting and trying to feed on sharks. In 2009, Norwegian Tommy Wirkola filmmaker took the zombie and combined it with that other icon of evil in entertainment, the Nazi. What he was able to create with this combo is the horror film Dead Snow.

The film begins with a lone woman running frantically through the snows somewhere in the mountain fjords of Norway with unknown figures chasing her. Like most horror films which begins like this her fate looks to be predetermined and how she finally buys it shows the audience that this is not going to be the usual zombie film as undead figures tear her apart and devour her while wearing the typical Nazi regalia. This gory start segues into the unfortunate group who will end up having to experience and deal with the sudden problem of WWII-era Nazis who had occupied Norway during the war and had ended up being buried (and presumed killed by the Norwegians near the end of the war) for decades in the snows of the Norwegian mountainside.

There's really nothing too special about the seven students who decided to spend their Easter vacationing in the mountain cabin owned by the young woman killed earlier in the film. They're not one-dimensional characters, but they're also not the smartest tools in the shed as they make the usual mistakes young people make while staying at an isolated cabin high up in the mountain with a reputation for being haunted and cursed. The film's director also co-wrote this script with screenwriter Stig Frode Henriksen and one could almost sense they were trying to emulate the group dynamics of the group in Edgar Wright's instant zombie-comedy classic Shaun of the Dead. While Wirkola and Henriksen never reach the same level of creativity in their characters the actors playing them do a good enough job that we root for them to survive the siege of the suddenly hungry Nazi zombies outside their cabin.

Dead Snow does have something which raises the film from being dull and predictable into something very entertaining and thrilling through it's many gory set-pieces. These scenes as the survivors try to fight their way and escape the Nazi zombies (or are they zombie Nazis) doesn't skimp on the blood and gore. Wirkola may have known that the story of his film was very thin on plot with characters a step or two above cardboard so decided to just let the grue fly. It's here that Dead Snow suddenly becomes jet-fueled roller-coaster ride as bodies (both living and undead) get mutilated, decapitated, blasted, shot-up and everything in-between. The final stand-off with the final survivors and an increasing number of Nazi zombies makes this film worth watching.

Tommy Wirkola's Dead Snow doesn't bring too many new things to the zombie genre (Nazi zombies having been done decades earlier in films such as Shock Waves and Oasis of the Zombies), but he does add some dark humor and a healthy dose of over-the-top zombie mayhem that makes the film quite entertaining despite it's flaws. Plus, how can one go wrong with picking something to watch that has Nazi zombies gallivanting their bloody way through Norwegian mountainsides with a hankering for Norwegian students.",1318204800,,3512,4.858096828046745

3966048,5,B002PTTL22,"WARNING - MOVIE SPOILERS BELOW

Best spoof zombie film to date.

Unique and funny
1. These Zombies are Nazies.
2. Liked the fact that the girls and guys actively fought back using ingenious and sometimes funny zombie kill methods like biting the zombies themselves if they had nothing else, blowing them up with their own WWII bombs and aiming for a zombie head kill by whatever means handy.  They all ""finish"" the job of killing a zombie if they have that advantage instead of running away allowing the zombie a chance to go after them again.  Only one idiot guy in the bunch stood around scared while everyone rushed to protect the windows and he got eaten early on.  Mounting a WWII machine gun onto a snow mobile was hilarious and an ingenious way to kill the Nazi zombies.
3. Unlike the usual run of the mill zombies, these zombies are smart. They use binoculars, have a leader to coordinate their attacks, etc.
4. These zombies have anti-freeze or something in their veins to keep from freezing solid in the winter snow.
5. Human cuts off zombie bitten arm to avoid becoming a zombie and then gets bitten in crotch.
6. Not too many zombie movies have people falling into an outhouse ""hole""
7. Not very likely that the two remaining guys will play ""bait"" to draw zombies to them while the 2 remaining girls try to get away especially when one of the guy doesn't know one of the girls.  In the world of equality today, not going to happen.
8. Hanging by zombie intestines over a cliff was very funny, unique and scary.
9. Usually zombies punch a hole with their fists though soil/dirt and make their way to the surface, these zombies punch up through snow.
10. The Nazis zombies were like pirates or that evil leprechaun, give them their gold and they leave you alone.

Gory
1. Not too many zombie movies draw and quarter their humans.
2. A lot of gory scenes

Scary
1. Liked the fact that most of the humans are ALONE when attacked which makes the film much scarier and each was brilliant in zombie killing strategies even while sometimes dying themselves.
2. Unique camera perspective of seeing death from a victim's eyes while being eaten alive.
3. These zombies can kill a human and instead of staying around to eat, they all leave their ""dinner"" to chase the stilling running humans which is scary because there is less chance for others to get away.
4. Can a guy who just sawed off one arm and was severely bitten in the crotch by a zombie outrun running zombies?

Stupid (on purpose or just plain stupid)but which make viewers scream ""Don't Do That"".
1. Do birds lay eggs in winter?  If not, then the storyline of the mama bird (crow?) giving away the treed girl's position to the zombies was bogus.
2. One of the girls is wearing a bright red coat which against the white snow makes her stand out from miles away.  It might have been a good idea to find another coat in that cabin or turn the red one inside out if the color inside was different/not so bright.  The other girl is wearing a white coat that cannot be easily seen in the snow at least during the day.  Both girls STOP running to STAND AROUND in the open arguing whether to split up allowing the zombies to reach them.  Sadly, this did not end well for one of them.
3. 2 surviving men who are on full alert having just killed zombies are saved by a their friend on a snow mobile.  The two men FACE the other man after the zombie kills and it is IMPOSSIBLE for them NOT to see 5 zombies walking up behind their friend close enough to kill him when there was an open field behind him and they could CLEARLY see anything coming. Unrealistic.
4. There is no way most women would go to an outhouse ALONE especially at night so that is an unlikely scenario> And it is just plain stupid for either a woman or a man to go alone as there are bears, wolves, etc. still around even without the zombie threat.
5. Blood comes out of zombies mouths who haven't bitten or eaten a human at all or bit one too far in the past to still have blood dripping from their mouths.
6. Girl who survives on her own killing zombies stupidly grabs her boyfriend who is busy killing zombies and who has no idea she was even alive let alone in the area and when she grabs him from behind, he swings around and stabs her thinking she is a zombie.  It is hard to feel sorry for her for being that stupid or to believe she would be that stupid when she was smart enough to stay alive for so long on her own.
7. Why didn't one of the 2 remaining men jump on the snow mobile mounted with a machine gun to either get away (with or without the other guy) or to use that very convenient machine gun while the other guy was occupied with watching his girlfriend die?  They both KNOW these zombies ALWAYS have more coming yet they stood around like idiots until the ""head zombie"" brought up more troops and then ran. Why did they drop their light cleavers and knives obtained from the shed?  The guy with the shotgun should have had cleavers/knives tucked in/around his jacket/pants/boots.  These guys left with no weapons at all.
8. The ending was predicable.  WHY do ""survivors"" ALWAYS pause to lean against a vehicle to catch their breath and then when finally inside either stop to cry and/or STOP TO put on their seat belt which when you have one arm is hard to do?  The guy could have tossed that coin or been long gone if he hadn't stupidly waited around.

Left Hanging
1 Never found out how the Nazis became zombies - infection?  Evil spirit spell?
2. Never found out if a human biting a zombie or having a zombie bite a human, turned a human into a zombie.
3. Never explained who the older man was who came in for a cup of coffee and warned them about ""Nazis"".  Why was he up in the mountains to begin with and camping alone in a tent in the middle of winter?
4. Were the zombies at the end of the film when the head Nazi says ""ARISE"" the zombies already torn apart by the humans (heads crushed/cut to pieces) and ""healed"" or were they new zombies laying under the snow all this time?  If just healed zombies, then these zombies are indestructible.",1317859200,2,6092,4.355692850838482

3966052,4,B002PTTL22,"Dead Snow might be pretty implausible (but then what zombie movie isn't), but it sure is a lot of fun!  I also liked how Dead Snow's zombie's didn't fall into the popular culture style of moaning arms out in front, stiff legged slow walking with a purpose only to eat either the brains or flesh of the living.  In fact who says the villains are even zombies at all? They are a group of German soldiers who fled a Norwegian village that turned on them near the end of World War II, and up into the mountains they went.  Somehow (it's never explained), they've become through whatever they came across or had with them, (some secret chemical weapon maybe), what they are today.  Something has let them either remain alive all this time or come back from the dead, whatever it was these soldiers aren't going to pass for regular humans anymore. For some reason they've emerged from wherever they've been buried, hiding or whatever all these years, and have decided to have their vengeance on the locals (who in their eyes are now a group of medical students staying at an old isolated lodge).  While some of the students' demise will happen early upon the soldiers arrival, it is when the remaining start to fight back that the real visual fun begins.  And it wouldn't become a cult horror movie if it didn't provide a talking point away from the trying to survive the zombies aspects and Dead Snow certainly has a gross one involving an obese guy who gets lucky when a slutty med student appears while he's having a movement on a long drop outdoor toilet and proceeds to do him right there and then while still sitting on the throne.

The movie takes a little while to get going but once it does it's a lot of fun.  A lot of the death scenes of both humans and zombies are quite entertaining as well as the behaviour of the med students as they try to combat their Hollywood fears of zombies such as reacting to getting bitten so they don't become one.

Definitely one of the most fun horror movies that's been made in a while!  You can either read the small amount of dialogue in the film as subtitles or switch on the English dubbed soundtrack as you watch this.",1309996800,,2162,4.450632911392405
3966053,4,B002PTTL22,"I saw it on Netflix last year.
The movie is a pretty good and is probably only 1 of 3 really good zombie flicks featuring Nazis.

I believe it is the only zombie flick from Norway at this time.

The cover on the DVD is from an actual scene within the movie.

The special effects and makeup are done really well.

The acting is professional and not typical B grade. (I don't know any of the actors but they may be well known in Norway)

Plenty of blood splatter occurs.

Zombie fans will probably want to own this one!

I won't give away the plot as usual, but lets just say:
Young People, ski lodge, nazi zombies, mayhem ensues! Typical zombie plot!

Some people have called it a comedy, but I'm not sure a few humorous moments qualifies it as a comedy as most would expect something like

The plot is pretty simple... six college kids (3 guys and 3 girls) go to a remote cabin in the mountains... have a little fun... meet a weird local, who tells them of Nazi horrors during the war... and then get killed off one by one by Nazi zombies...

What else do you need, or want?

Well, I just finished watching this film... and it was bloody disgusting! It was fun, funny, bloody and way over the top. This is one of the top 10 best zombie movie ever made, and the best Nazi zombie movie ever made!

You have to see it for yourself, and judge for yourself. Don't let some of the negative reviews here tell you otherwise. They don't know squat! They have reveiwed the subtitled version, and obviously they can't read...

Basically, if you liked ""Shaun of the Dead"", you'll love ""Dead Snow""...

(2.) For those whose lives are defined by zombieism then any movie with really bad fake makeup and pig intestines is the highlight of their lives. Even the blood splatter looked looked like it was sprayed on.
(3.) Storyline consists of the same old tiresome cabin in the woods somehow quite clean despite being seldom, if ever, used. Male and female med students that should have some intelligence doing really dumb things; not liking blood; trying a really bad sex scene in an outhouse; don't bother to walk the couple of miles back to their cars. Cars parked on a road that was snow free in a snowy wilderness yet nobody else is around? Zombies wear quite new looking uniforms for being buried for 50 years.
(4.) No explanation given as to why these beasties are unnoticed all those years; how they are able to sustain their excellent running metabolism, blood and muscles, etc. without cellular replenishment. Why a knife wound anywhere sometimes kills them and then sometimes doesn't.

3966066,5,B002PTTL22,"I have a thing for foreign horror movies, I admit it. I get so disgusted by the lack of true horror and originality of the American films, that I actively search out foreign films. I have seen many very entertaining movies as a result and would like to pass on my reviews of them so that more people may enjoy and appreciate them. Once such gem is Dead Snow. This is a Norwegian zombie horror/comedy film that was released in 2009. Zombies, you say? Zombies have been done to death, right? Wrong! The genius of this movie is that it combines zombies and Nazis.

The film starts out with a group of young folks arriving at a cabin near Oksfjord for some fun and relaxation. Right away, they realize that one of their number, Sarah, is missing and not yet at the cabin as arranged. The group decides to continue on to the cabin and wait for her to show up. Later that night a strange old man shows up and tells them a very odd local story involving an invasion of World War II Nazis and stolen gold. He goes on to say that the locals formed an uprising and killed many of the Nazis, while others, including the leader, Herzog froze to death somewhere in the mountains.

The next morning, Sara's boyfriend Vegard decides to take the snowmobile and go look for Sara. Instead he finds a tent with the mutilated body of the old man. What follows is a horror/comedy delight of zombie Nazis, chainsaws, axes, and murder with a deadly snowmobile. This film is the closest thing I have seen to Evil Dead. It's at times gory, entertaining and even has some funny American pop culture references.

I loved this movie and would recommend it to anyone that likes movies such as Evil Dead, Dead and Breakfast, Dead Alive, Night of the Demons, Cabin Fever and Slither. Dead Snow is subtitled but don't let that scare you. If you are reading this, then you can surely watch this movie and read the subtitles!",1295827200,,1891,4.443804034582133

It starts out with a group of medical students going to an isolated cabin in the mountains while on a skiing trip. Like The Evil Dead this film starts out slowly but builds up and eventually gets some good payoff. While the group is in the cabin they come across a hiker that tells them about Nazi soldiers that survived a local uprising retreating into the mountains and all freezing to death. The horror part starts out with shadowy figures from the woods taking out several of the students and the hiker one by one. The rest of the movie turns into a horror comedy similar in style to ""Dead Alive"" with abundant gore as the survivors try to both escape and fight back against the undead Nazi soldiers.

I have found that you must kiss a lot of frogs to find a hidden gem.  Fortunately, this movie is a gem!  It does not seem low budget, the cinematography is incredible (amazing landscapes with the mountains and snow) and the zombies look great!  The gore is perfect and they do not go over the top with CGI.  One of my biggest complaints is when they beat the CGI horse to death and you feel like you are watching a video game or something fake (last 3 Star Wars movies are a perfect example of how CGI can help ruin a movie).  The acting is very good for a horror movie and the story itself keeps your interest.  This is not just a horror movie.  It is more of a horror with comedy mixed in.  Similar to the Evil Dead.

Good plot - Check
Excellent cinematography - Check
Relatively unknown movie - Check
Well done special effects - Check
Gore - Check
Well done Zombies - Check
Respectable acting - Check
Babes - Check
Scary/Funny - Check
Good ending - Check

So I'm trying to watch it and the subtitles are small, poorly placed, and the yellow color all conspire to make it unreadable.

3966089,3,B002PTTL22,"Can you really go wrong with a horror film featuring zombie nazis, tons of gore and a streak of black humor a mile wide?

Unfortunately yes.

While ""Dead Snow"" does have it's moments, the overall film just doesn't live up to the premise it lays out. 8 med students take a break at a remote cabin high in the mountains of Norway. (I should say 7 med students as one is killed before the opening credits even begin) We, and the unfortunate campers learn that during World War II a Nazi regiment ruled the area with and iron fist, apparently so cruel to the locals that after three years the Norwegians banded together and chased the Nazis into the hills.....where their evil may still be lurking.

Early on one of the characters references ""The Evil Dead""...and you get the vibe from ""Dead Snow"" that the filmmakers are striving for that tone or feel. The problem is they simply don't commit to it. At times ""Dead Snow"" is downright creepy, and at others it's so over the top it's cartoonish....they should have gone for one type of film or the other.

Also if you are hoping for ""zombies""...you will be disappointed. The undead Nazis in this film are similar to the leper-ghosts in John Carpenter's ""The Fog"". Don't expect Romero's shambling corpses, or the rage filled fast zombies of ""28 Days Later""....the Nazis aren't out because of hunger...they are out because of greed.

If you are gorehound, you'll probably dig this flick, the last half hour spills almost as much red stuff as ""Inside""...but in a ""Dead Alive"" cartoonish way.

As a horror fan I enjoyed stumbling across this flick, it was different (which is a rarity in horror these days), and I would love to find the soundtrack someplace as the music was great. I highly recommend you throw this on your Netflix account for a rental or order it On Demand...as far as a purchase I'm not so sure. Maybe once it hits the below $5 used market.

Oh...and no review would be complete with mention of ""the outhouse scene"". Yes tons of blood get spilled in the film, we see limbs hacked off, eye gouged out and quite a few other nasty scenes thrown into the film...but nothing....NOTHING...clinched my stomach more than the scene in the outhouse.....just so vile and wrong...and the one image I'm sure I'll NEVER be able to fully erase from my brain....ew[...]",1278028800,,2313,4.654411764705882

The acting was okay. Not great, not horrible. Some of it may have been the voice acting of the

The special effects were occasionally not very believable. Like someone whose head gets torn in half manually as if his skull is made of rubber... Among other things.

The makeup effects for the zombies were pretty decent, however.

This is an atypical zombie movie, insofar as the zombies are Nazis and are also ""smart"" zombies to some degree. Seeing as how they work together and can apparently plan things, rather than being completely mindless killing machines. though they are somewhat of that too. They also seem to have a ""motivation"" for the violence and goring that we find out by the end of the movie.

There is plenty of gut munching and other aggressive zombieness, so this is definitely a ""zombie"" movie.

there's also a bit of comedy mixed in here and there.

3966097,3,B002PTTL22,"Some say Norwegian film ""Dead Snow"" (""Dd Sn"") is a horror comedy. Yes, it is, and not a terrible one, I believe, but if you are looking for tongue-in-cheek humor of, say, ""Shaun of the Dead,"" you will be disappointed. Norwegian-born director Tommy Wirkola deliver the jokes with a straight face in his sophomore feature, and not all jokes are for everyone - supposing zombies in Nazi uniforms are really intended as a joke.

The story is a very familiar one. A group of med school students are on vacation, staying at a remote cabin in the snow-covered mountains. They snowmobile, they drink, they make love (in the outhouse) and they do one stupid thing. And flesh-eating Nazi zombies start attacking the hapless students.

Not exactly a very original story except the Nazi zombie part, you might say. Obviously the filmmakers are aware of that. (I read Tommy Wirkola's first feature is a parody of ""Kill Bill"" and it comes as no surprise.) Still we are not perfectly sure whether the director is subverting clich and stereotype of horror films, or only repeating them.

""Dead Snow"" is fairly entertaining. It is brutal, gruesome and gory, and the film has some nice ideas (such as machine-gun battle), but still the film ultimately seems like something of a missed opportunity, definitely in need of something new, like the distinct style Sam Raimi brought in, in his ""Evil Dead"" franchise.",1272499200,4,1392,4.864978902953586

There are a few cover-your-eyes moments, and some brilliant how-did-they-think-of-that whammies. The story overall is very European, but also happens to some thoroughly modern and Yankified Norwegian med students on vacation. They even quote Indiana Jones.

The film does live up to my expectations for the most part starting out with some atmosphere and getting more campy as the film progresses. The zombie make-up and gore FX are very good and the acting is better than average for this type of stuff, but I can't help feeling that this film would have been really great if it wasn't played for laughs as the film gets into the second half.

Don't get me wrong, this film is a lot of fun and I was very entertained by it, but with a premise including Nazi zombies and Hitler's lost treasures,....well...this could have been truly frightening if played straight with the creepy atmosphere of horror classic The Mummy starring Boris Karloff. Instead it leans a little towards a serious Zombieland.

The Blu Ray looks sweet and there are some cool extras including out takes, feature-ettes, make up test, trailers etc. If you're looking for some cool zombies and gore with a little over the top thrown in then Dead Snow will not disappoint, but for serious horror fans looking for some real chills, then this film might not do the trick.",1270425600,2,1160,4.519047619047619

In this case we escape into the ""Dead Snow"" for about an hour and a half of healthy blood squirting zombie fun. When watching ""Dod Sno"", be prepared to see some excellent B movie scenes. Ignore some of the minor goofs in continuity, a few plot holes that a main character could fall into, ignore those, and you will enjoy this movie just fine.

Leading off the movie is a hunting scene, reminiscent of the beginning of ""Jaws"", the girl who ventures out on her own, is running thru the white Norwegian snow, over hills, down snow paths spotted with trees absent their foliage, like running thru barbed wire. The Zombie Nazis soon made short work of our introductory character, Sara. Our anti-heroes, four male and three female medical students driving in separate care to rendezvous with each other in a cabin out in the middle of nowhere. The rest of the movie is somewhat predictable, lonesome cabin, no cell coverage, creepy stranger appearing with a warning, people going missing, reminds me of a ""Scooby Doo"" episode.

Director Tommy Wirkola, can say the same.

No doubt, this movie has some issues, such as images in the trailer are not in the movie, continuity issues, and a few story holes, but don't let that get in the way of this fun movie. While watching ""Dead Snow"" I noticed how tense my body was, knowing that our heroes are going to get it.

Sure, these zombies look like zombies, but it is their actions/behavior that set them apart from many zombies seen in hundreds of films.  It's as if these dead nazis don't know they're dead and still have a mission to carry out!  The nazi leader is quite menacing and I have a feeling that he (mostly him), and his clan will become iconic as Jason and Freddy for example.  I've always found that the nazi suits and their symbol to be truly scary but yet stylish.  Relax, I'm just complimenting on nazi clothing and flag design, not their actions (haha).  Anyways, back to why I love these zombies.  Not only is it great that the leader still knows he's a leader, but I think it's awesome that the rest of zombies haven't forgotten their deadly, military ways and know to work as a team and obey the commands ordered from their leader.  The zombies depicted in this flick are a bunch of hunting/fighting/killing machines!!!  Again, they believe they have a greater purpose for their actions and it's not to go out and munch on folks.  I don't think I need to go into detail with gore because the front cover says it all.  Another A+++ for old school special effects!  Even though I'm a fan and have much love for 'Shock Waves', 'Oasis of the Zombies', 'Zombie Lake', and 'Outpost', this blows those out of the water!

Purists might not like it as much as I did since it has a good bit of humor thrown in and the zombies are not mindless ""shufflers"", but there is enough gore and suspense to make it worthwhile for most fans of the genre.

No plot spoilers from me; the movie follows a group of Norwegian medical students (one with an intense dislike of blood) who travel to a remote cabin on a snowy mountain for a Holiday getaway. I really liked the isolated feeling that was conveyed and the detached outhouse added a level of creepiness all on it's own. The general setting is also fairly unique since the most of the action takes place in the snow.

The setup is a little forced with some of the early dialog making references to other horror movies and a convenient visit from a ""local"" who fills the students (and us) in on the local history Nazi occupation.

This was a fairly fun, but disposable zombie flick.

The movie starts with a young woman running through the snowy forest. She stops, only to see that her pursuers are closing in on her.

Next scene: Four guys (Roy, Vegard, Martin and Erlend) ride in one car while 3 of the girls (Liv, Hanna and Chris) ride in another, on their way to the cabin. The last girl, Sara, had decided to ski her way  there. When the 7 people in the cars reach their destination, they rejoice  in the snow and come the evening, they play games and enjoy themselves indoors.

Then a man comes by and tell them about the history of the place. During WW2 a German Einsats group was there, lead by colonel Herzog. They were violent and began a terror campaign against the civilian population. When the tide turned, the Germans luted the homes of the locals, grabbing all valuables they could get their hands on. Those who objected were shot. The people had had enough, and they armed themselves with anything that could be used as a weapon, from hammers to shovels, and went after the nazis. Some Germans were killed but Herzog was among those who managed to escape. They sought refuge in the mountains, where they were believed to have frozen to death. People in the area still avoided the place, afraid of resurrecting the evil there.

The following day Sara still hasn't returned, and Vegard takes the snow scooter to go look for her. He tells his friends that if he's not back by tomorrow, they shall go back and get help. The 6 remaining students spend another day in the snow. In the evening, Chris fails to return from the outside lavatory, and the guys are sent out to look for her. They can't find Chris, but they do find Sara's backpack. Then they meet Herzog and his boys.

In my most humble opinion Shaun of the Dead was a nice fresh zombie movie to come out in past 10 years, and 28 Days Later and it's shall I dare say the better sequel 28 Weeks Later?

Dead Snow a Norwegian horror import is a homage to Romero, and Evil Dead most notably, even a character says, ""How many horror movies started off with 6 people in a cabin in the woods?"" Goes to show what you are in for.

Ok so you can read the plot synopsis on other reviews here's my Pros and Cons

Pros: nice gore effects, cool zombie kills (a machine gun mounted on a snowmobile, pretty kick a**), scenes that give homage to Evil Dead and Dawn of the Dead, (remember in DOTD the elevator door opens and lots and lots of zombies pull one of the guys in.... it was done in Shaun of the Dead also, a similar scene in this too) nice twists in who lives and who dies, doesn't follow Hollywood formulaic slasher rules, female actresses in this are very attractive, nice to have our protagonists fight Nazi Zombies hasn't been done in a while, there's no epidemic, no virus that turns you into a zombie in this movie, cool soundtrack

Cons: Trying to be Shaun of the Dead, as in have brutal zombie violence then punctuated through out with some off kilter humor (There's even a scene where two guys go in the shed and find a plethora of tools, a chainsaw to be one, a chainsaw is always in a zombie movie for some reason, it's a nasty way to kill those gosh darn undead I guess. The 2 guys use these tools to kill the Zombie Blitzkrieg onslaught. I believe it's a tough balance trying to do something serious then comedy, Shaun of the Dead was a prefect Zom/Com movie and Zombieland, then there's 28 Days Later a more brood, serious, zombie flick. It's like you gotta pick one or the other. some of the characters were cliques, got the fat funny guy, the ""good guy"" of the movie, the sweet couple, a crazy creepy old guy, the smart ass of the group etc.... anyways coulda used a little more T&A also

3966111,3,B002PTTL22,"DEAD SNOW is a fine entry to the zombie genre and an even better entry to the ""Nazi zombie"" sub-genre.  The movie is shot beautifully in grand vistas and the undead look very convincing.  While the gore is over the top at times, there are some amazing moments.  The film has scary and funny scenes.  It seems to switch back and forth in a free manner between the serious and silly.

**Spoilers**

Two moments strike me as horrific beyond belief.

1. When one of the characters is overtaken by Zombies and knocked out, she awakens slowly to juicy slurping sounds to find herself lying on her back with zombies playing in her stomach cavity with her internal organs.  This is shot from a first person point of view.  It gives the viewer a very disturbing perspective.

2. Another character finds herself buried in the snow after a fall from a cliff face.  The scene drags on for a very long time giving a terrible claustrophobic feel.  This scene bothers me more than anything else except the ""being eaten alive"" scene.

All in all, DEAD SNOW was a fun movie if you are a zombie fan.  The gore was very over the top, but I have to say that the acting was quite good if you watch it with the subtitles.  The dubbed voice actors to English were very bad.  Watch it in the original language with English subtitles.  It is way better.  NOT FOR KIDS!!!",1267142400,3,1345,4.420408163265306
3966112,3,B002PTTL22,"Dead Snow had a minor theatrical release in Chicago and got very favorable reviews. I wasn't going to travel the distances necessary to see it so I was looking forward to the video release. I somehow lucked out and was able to rent it on release day. This is a peculiar viewing experience. It starts out pretty straight forward. a group of Swedish(?) 20 somethings plan to spend some vacation time in a remote cabin in the mountains. They get there. They eat, drink and make merry until they are visited by one of the locals who is more than a bit creepy himself. Anyway......he proceeds to give them the skinny on the nasty history of the area involving sadistic, greedy Nazis and how the locals got their violent revenge on all but a number that escaped.

Of course things start to go bad for our heroes as the Nazis, now zombiefied, show up and exact a revenge of their own. This is where things get weird. Later in the second act the film is injected with a Sam Raimiesque style of humor. The director even gives Raimi more than a nod by duplicating (stealing?) something straight out of Evil Dead II. It is a stark u-turn from the beginning of the film. I'm not exactly certain yet if that's a bad thing or not. Up to that point I wasn't very impressed. There wasn't really anything very different or inventive going on so at least the change perked me up. From there to the end it's a wild ride with tons o' gore that tips the goo scale way over.

The movie is well shot and edited with decently staged action sequences. The make-up effects were also pretty cool. The music score though was a bit uneven. I liked most of the original scoring but the heavy metal pieces annoyed me. It's a comfortable enough movie to watch and worth the time for most fans of the genre, but beware. Certain holes in the script, along with the schizo turn in the flavor, might be off-putting to some.

Part of the Midnight Adrenaline series at SIFF 2009, Dead Snow delivered exactly that--lots and lots of adrenaline! The kills are outrageously gross and wickedly funny and the tone moves back and forth between scary and comic with a constant ebb and flow, delivering regular cathartic relief to the build-up of terror. My favorite: when one of the men cuts off his own arm with a chainsaw, trying to avoid infection, because he's just been bitten by a Nazi zombie and doesn't want to turn into a zombie! If that doesn't sound like an absolutely inspired sight-gag to you, stay far away from this! These are zombie experts (zombie film-buffs that is) so they are better equipped than most of the victims in your average zombie flick to launch a spirited defense. Granted, I haven't seen every zombie flick out there, but I thought this fact alone added a good deal of originality to the story. Of course they don't listen to the warning from the local, who turns out to be way less savvy about survival of a zombie attack then the kids he's warning--I mean, how has this dude ever lived long enough to give the creepy warning in the first place?!?! Visually, despite it's low budget, it delivers realthe goods--perhaps because you can't really go wrong with an isolated cabin in the snow-covered mountains of Norway.

And so begins Dead Snow, an intense foreign film which only ever slows down to display a little bit of the character's personalities before the gruesome events occur again. The fact that it is subtitled does not detract anything from one's enjoyment of the film.

From then on we watch as seven Norwegian med students decide to spend their Easter vacation in an isolated cabin near Oksfjord. While they wait for the main guy's girlfriend to arrive, who actually owns the cabin, they decide to pass the time by drinking and setting up opportunities for possible hook-ups. The fun is soon spoiled by the arrival of a mysterious stranger, an older man who warns them of the evil history of the area.

It seems that during WWII, a sadistic Nazi commander named Colonel Herzog was in charge of the nearby Naval base, and under his reign the locals were robbed, tortured and murdered for three long years before they decided to exact their revenge. They attacked the Nazi's while they slept and managed to kill a great number of them. Herzog and many of his soldiers escaped into the frozen woods though, taking with them a fortune in gold, jewelry and coins.

The creepiness of the stranger, who goes nameless, and the fact that Vegard's girlfriend Sara has still not shown up by morning, leads the students to believe that something is definitely wrong with their vacation destination.

The suspense regarding who gets killed is fairly effective, and should keep you guessing, considering that one character who is absolutely squeamish at the sight of blood is forced to step up and commit brutally violent acts, and is responsible for the most shocking incident in the entire movie.

The first was the classic 'shock waves"" (1976) followed by the french low budget effort ""zombie lake"" (1980) and jess franco's 'oasis of the zombies"" (1983) and then by the excellent 'outpost"" (2007) and now by ""Dead Snow"" (2009).  This movie has far more gore than the three early efforts; but that was different era; although ""outpost"" has more interesting characters than ""dead snow"" which is your typical in the know young people who are the target of the Nazi Zombies wrath.

Unlike the first time efforts of the many ultra low budget horror zombie flicks shot awkwardly and sometimes on video tape.

This movie is part ghost story in that the zombies are protecting their loot rather than just killing people for no reason.  And that's a good twist to this very good horror movie.  The film has a english dubbed  soundtrack (in stereo) and the original Norwegian soundtrack (with english subtitles in 5.1) to choose from as well. The best thing about the more modern flicks (outpost and this one)  is that the movies prints look fantastic and are without blemishes.  The three older movies while decent prints needed some cleaning up.  This is a great entry into the Nazi Zombie genre and it's well shot and has a 'evil dead"" type of humour to it which is fun enough.  This movie is good enough to be made in America which shows how far some low budget filmmakers have come since the early 1980's.  Not that ""zombie lake"" doesn't have it's own low budget charms; it's not on this level and couldn't be.  So a hearty sieg Zombie to this
solid fun horror feature.",1260403200,64,2091,4.545454545454546

They aren't out for brains or even recruits. They just want what belongs to them, and will stop at nothing to get it. It's a very fun/gross movie. If you know what to expect, going into it, you'll love it.

8377341,4,B002PTTL22,"Is there anything cooler in the horror realm than Nazi zombies? This Norwegian movie starts slowly, beginning as one big cliche (as one of the characters duly acknowledges) with a group of young men and women heading to a log cabin in the middle of the mountains. ""How many movies begin like this?"" indeed. There's the traditional visit from an apparently demented stranger, warning our heroes and heroines that something evil lurks around these here parts and that they're all doomed; a warning at which they duly scoff and proceed to get drunk and make out.

Things shift into high gear when the Nazi zombies turn up, on the hunt for their long-lost gold. There's murder, mayhem, and violence galore. Limbs, heads, and intestines fly, chainsaws buzz, and machine guns go full-auto in the last half hour, which is where most of the film's budget seems to have been spent.

There's nothing particularly new, groundbreaking, or original in ""Dead Snow."" The fun is all in the execution (and take it from me, there are plenty of executions). So if you're in the market for some zombie schlock horror with a Nazi-themed twist, this is just the flick for you.",1483228800,,1154,4.793969849246231
