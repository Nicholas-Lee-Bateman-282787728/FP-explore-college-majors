5112334,3,B007WB5CZS,"...but not for those expecting a 2012 3D presentation.  While the content is well thought out and intelligent, it's at the forefront of 3D imagery. With the exception of the 'title' screen, you must train your eye interactively to appreciate the 3D presentation. No big deal? It takes some repeated effort to refocus each time you look away from the imagery. Not what you're probably used to, like me! So be prepared for an extremely interesting documentary and a first gen 3D experience.",1343088000,8,488,4.879518072289157
5112335,5,B007WB5CZS,I've been a space geek ever since the 1960s. The Viking missions of the 1970s were the next biggest thing that NASA did following the manned missions to the Moon. Imagine seeing the surface of Mars in 3D! The background of this project and the involvement of the composers from Stanford only enhances the footage.,1340150400,,313,4.709090909090909
8522494,4,B007WB5CZS,"The actual doco is about 30 mins, with perhaps 15 or 20 mins of still images in 3D.
And about 10 demonstrating the Viking Lander in action in 3D, but not on Mars, on Earth, with thorough satisfying scientific or technical explanations.
Made in 1978, this pioneering work preceded the early 80's 3D movie bn.

SURFACE 3D
With the Viking's cameras at 80 metres apart, sorry but it seems that wide sometimes, .08 metres apart and so close to the ground, the foreground presents probably the most extreme 3D ever, which if you persist patiently, will become merged, despite the learned narrator insisting many viewers cannot merge the bottom half. This doesn't have to remain true.
  I knew how hauntingly hard it would be viewing the first panorama of still images from another planet. Yet once you get halfway down successfully, in a short time you can find yourself looking in focus at what is at the bottom that only moments before seemed ridiculously impossible. And you go, ""Am I doing that??""
  An alternative is to relax and causally gaze in the mid-field expecting nothing, til the bottom automatically starts projecting out and you see finally the 3D effect come to life. Your eyes almost have to go to another level, almost ppping ut by themselves. Then you can look up and feel your human, or alien as it were, eyes refocus on the further objects, just like in real life being there on Mars. While the narrator consistently gives fully detailed explanation of what you are looking at.

OBITAL 3D
Less effective are the orbital 3D photos, one side taken at a different time to the other on a different pass so one image has different shadows,  making merging marred. One can be thankful these are few.

IMAGE QUALITY
  The images don't look hi-def, nor the narrator, though I think the transfer is, and the film was 16mm.
Mars has it's pink tone, but almost looks monochrome. But the Viking - with its sharp edges and details - looks better with good color.

SOUND
  The atmospheric electronic quadraphonic music is very hi-fi and fits perfectly, similar to how the music of 2001: a space odyssey fits.

8522496,1,B007WB5CZS,i was expecting a movie in 3d not pictures in 3d,1410739200,,48,3.4545454545454546
8522497,5,B007WB5CZS,I wish I  was younger I wood go to mars in a second,1372204800,,51,2.923076923076923
8522498,2,B007WB5CZS,"It was really not an excited 3D video, the quality of 3D scenes was quite poor and the pictures were not plastic at all.",1363564800,2,120,4.041666666666667
8522499,1,B007WB5CZS,I found this film to be boring most of the time. I realise that the images  travelled across  space to get here but surely they could have been better. We were only given a  small selection of the actual  photos taken and not all were of interest to me. Surely NASA has  thousands of better images?,1362873600,,298,4.25
8522500,5,B007WB5CZS,"What I liked very Much of this Blu-ray it has A great 3D Effect,which you don""t find much in other 3D movies Or is just me,And I hav""nt looked harder enough
Otherwise the film scope is in 4.3,I guess the rest of the Film is Looking over some old pictures of going over  Mars.
So if you like Documentarys or just want a Great 3d Affect to look at,Or a New to 3D,This is the One to Buy",1362355200,,383,3.91025641025641
8522501,1,B007WB5CZS,"I own several other NASA and space related 3D discs, so I thought this might make a nice addition to my collection. I must not have seen the review where it says 'Viking mission from the 1970's' because the images and even the presenter are from that era. lol....the pictures are pretty much just rocks from the surface of Mars, with incredibly annoying electronic 'music' in the background. I would say the sounds are more sound effects than music, but whatever you call it I found it annoying. I am a huge electronic music fan, so maybe my tastes are spoiled by the likes of Tomita, Vangelis and Larry Fast. I could not watch this disc for more than a few minutes, as the pictures are so hard to focus on it was distracting. This should be used at Gitmo to torture the prisoners now that water boarding is out. lol.......I would have to agree with the reviewer that said this was 'unwatchable', only I would add 'unlistenable' as well. And for the people that gave this 5 stars, either they are on crack or they work for the company that produced this junk.",1361145600,6,1059,4.463917525773196
8522502,1,B007WB5CZS,"If I could give this zero stars, I would. I purchased this anticipating a 3D view of Mars from multiple perspectives. What I received was a collection of images whose 3D effect was so grossly shifted as to be unwatchable. After about 10-15 minutes of attempting to watch it, I gave up as my eyes were watering heavily.

This is NOT a DVD that I would recommend to anyone.",1355702400,5,371,4.3768115942028984
8522503,5,B007WB5CZS,"Mars in 3D is a great film about the martian planet.  It contains images taken by Viking I and II.  Its a great example of a restoration done by a team of people who generally are interested in the space program and have a deep respect for it.  It is great to see these images come to life after 30+ years.  The soundtrack is incredible to boot.  It has the original music composed for the film but it is in 5.1 surround now and sounds breath taking in your home theater.  This is highly recommended for people interested in space, 3D imagery, and electronic music alike!",1346976000,,571,4.339622641509434
