8183653,2,B000O76T54,"I bought this DVD because it features music and interviews of the late Emily Remler, a musician with whom I've been obsessed for a long time.  The fact it features three other jazz masters was icing on the cake.

The fact that the artists on this DVD are jazz masters is undeniable, but is the music on this DVD jazz?  Well, yes, but it is for the most part not the kind of jazz I like.  It opens with Emily on a heavily chorused acoustic guitar playing a beautiful swing/blues tune called ""Blues for Herb.""  After that Emily does several new age meandering pieces that left me pretty bored.  Next, Pat Martino plays several odd pieces with a piano player.  None of these pieces showcase the jazz chops of this great artist.  Steve Khan is next.  His unaccompanied pieces sound like completely improvised practice sessions without any real purpose or direction.  The DVD ends with Bill Frisell playing solo with lots of electronic effects.  His playing is spacey and sparse without much fire or direction.  He closes his little set with a weird version of ""Days of Wine and Roses"" that did nothing for me.

If fancy guitar licks are your thing, pick this on up and enjoy it, but as a jazz document, this DVD left me wanting more--or at least something.",1350518400,4,1252,4.560538116591928
8183654,3,B000O76T54,"There was some first rate playing on this DVD, but not my kind of music. I am a big fan of Jazz that swings or has a Bluesy element, a la Kenny Burrell.  The music on this DVD, for the most part had neither. Most of the performances were solo guitar, with no bass, drums or piano.

If you are looking for traditional Jazz, I suggest that you research each performer, especially Steve Khan and Bill Frisell. They may not be what you are looking for. Even Pat Martino, one of my top three favorite Jazz guitarists, played a non-swinging song, accompanied by only a pianist.

The quality of the DVD's sound suffered during the Pat Martino segment. I could see his fingers going spider-like up and down the fretboard and his right hand's powerful body jarring pick attack, but I could not hear the notes. It was as though they made a mistake in mixing the sound and edited his guitar out.

So while the performers were talented, and I enjoyed the little interviews with them. The music was just not what I like. But you might like it.",1333411200,3,1030,4.405263157894737
8183655,4,B000O76T54,"In order, Emily Remler was sparkling and fresh in her delivery.  Her songs were very melodic and entertaining.  The only other instances when I saw her on film(VHS) were when she performed on her 2 Hot Licks videos.  She was just so much more vivacious on the Jazz Masters collection.

I bought this DVD mostly to see Steve Kahn perform.  I love the way he interprets Monk tunes.  His technique is very unusual--he holds his guitar neck up close to his face at about a 60 degree angle.  What can I say, it works for him.  Nice job.

Pat is a master player.  I find myself getting lost, however, feeling little sense of melody.  He's not a favorite.

Frisell is a likable guy, and very talented, but a little too experimental for my taste.  Rockers may enjoy his brand of jazz more than that of the others.  He tends to use way more electronic effects than the others on the disc.

Overall, this is a fine DVD with the emphasis on variety and talent.  I am very pleased with it.",1282089600,3,977,4.344444444444444
