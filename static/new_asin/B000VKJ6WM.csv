8219158,5,B000VKJ6WM,"Guyver is an anime adaptation of a 1980's manga and an early 1990's Mark Hamill movie. Sadly the movie was dumb. Imagine Mark Hamill as a power ranger. That's pretty much the size of it. The anime is a different story. I was totally rocked by this series. There are tons of cool fight scenes. Lots of good villains and heroes. The voice acting is good and the animation is also pretty good. There is really good character development and some emotional scenes. This series also has lots of action to keep you interested.

I can't think of anything bad to say about Guyver. It's one you can watch several times and not get bored. It's not exactly one of the better anime titles out there, but it's still a lot of fun. I recommend giving it a try. I hope you like it as much as I do.",1353369600,,781,4.241610738255034
8219159,3,B000VKJ6WM,"I loved this episode, for the fact that I got to finally see the Gigantic!  But the reason I rated it only 3 stars was the fact that by the time the Gigantic hatched the fight with Neo-Zektole was over within 3 minutes!  I was expecting more, not a whole lot, but just a little more.  Another reason I only gave it 3 stars was that the writers have no intention as of last I checked around November 2007, to continue the series.  That's twice they've done this.  They did it with the previous series that they had started over 10 years ago. But that's my review on this movie.  Its still worth seeing, especially for us fans who have been around since the beginning of this whole Guyver idea who have been dying just to see the Gigantic move a finger!!",1204761600,,752,4.26056338028169
8219160,1,B000VKJ6WM,"Do not get me wrong.  I am a huge fan of Guyver.  Guyver is my favorite anime of all time, but after watching the final episode, it leaves you with this bitter taste of ""that's it?"".  I still like the original series better.  Even though, this new series has a deeper storyline and better animation, that's about it, the original one have more action and better fight sequence and music.  This is what bothers me for this new Guyver series, if you are planning on ressurecting a series, why would you make the same mistake with its trite ending?  There is no closure with this series.  They ruined it.  This was a waste attempt of  bringing back the Guyver.  Hopely, they will come up with some ways of expanding this like with the original 12 episodes where the first 6 episodes was categorized with an opening as GUYVER 1 and the last 6 episodes had a different opening as GUYVER 2.",1202169600,,884,4.434782608695652
8219161,5,B000VKJ6WM,"I don't see why you all don't like it. I mean ya it ends kinda in a cliffhanger but atlest we got more ten the old 12 part series so be thankful and lets hope for a season 2 so we can continue the story cuz this only coverd the manga to vol 10 if i remember right. I give this 5 stars just cause you didn't like the ending and wasn't so amazing as some of you may think doznt mean it should be a low rating.

But I think this dvd is great i have seen all the episdes last year so this is all nothing new but it still is a great series i really recomend buying this dvd to all guyver fans",1195084800,,587,3.6587301587301586
8219162,5,B000VKJ6WM,"Everyone is entitled to his/her opinion, but I disagree with the other reviews I've read.  I rated this five stars because I don't believe this is the end of the series.  I believe that it is a perfect setup for future seasons.  If this is actually the absolute end of the show, I agree that it is very bad, but if this is just the end of season one, it's great.  It shows the current reign of chronos, the fate of the guyvers and aptom, and it introduces the newly enhanced guyver 1.  It sets up the characters and the conflict to be resolved in season 2.

As far as the action is concerned, I thought it was adequate to tell the story.  It wasn't amazing, but it was still entertaining.

Overall, this was a great series, and this DVD had a good season finale (that is, of course, if they make another season).  I highly recomend it.",1194652800,3,835,4.234177215189874
8219163,1,B000VKJ6WM,"I totally agree with the other review.  If anything he was being too kind.  Two of the episodes are nothing but the yammering and whining of the secondary characters who are well aware that the only thing they can do is hide.  The only effect they ever have is to provide hostages to Chronos or prevent the Guyvers from using their heavy weapons for fear of toasting their friends.

When the main characters finally show up the fighting is extremely poor and uninteresting.

I disagree with the other review in one respect: I think the old Guyver series was better than this one in one respect. The old series did not pull its punches when it came to fighting.  The old opening showed the Guyver blasting out the eyes and crushing the skull of a Zoanoid.  The new series tones down the gore quite a lot and the fights are far less intense.

This new series does have better art, and it does do a better job of explaining what's going on and the back story is much richer.  But like the first series it ends leaving virtually every major plotline dangling leaving us with no story closure.

Overall this series is a long and expensive ride going nowhere.",1194480000,3,1153,4.473684210526316
