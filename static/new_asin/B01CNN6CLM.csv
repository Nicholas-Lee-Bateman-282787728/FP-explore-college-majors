7685045,5,B01CNN6CLM,"This is a must have for any aspiring artist or even a professional looking to learn some new tips and tricks. Jeff does a wonderful job of explaining his entire process piece by piece as he works. He presents the information which has likely taken him years upon years of research and experimentation to learn in a way that makes it easy to understand and fun to watch. The camerawork is also excellent. You really feel like you're there with him in his studio as he creates this tremendous piece of art. I find myself coming back to this video over and over again to reference certain techniques as I apply them in my own paintings. Bottom line, if you're reading this review, stop reading and click ""Buy"". You won't regret it.",1457568000,3,728,4.5227272727272725
7685046,5,B01CNN6CLM,"I wish there was a way to give this 6 stars, because to me it's that good. Jeff is a masterful painter and highly gifted art instructor. He has a good sense of humor that goes well with his instruction, you'll enjoy watching him as he paints and tells you what he's doing, as well as his thought process behind what he's doing. The production is top notch and it is loaded with enough information that you'll want to watch it again and again.",1457395200,2,442,4.273809523809524
7685047,5,B01CNN6CLM,"Jeff'em all!
I just wish that every contemporary artist shared his knowledge like Jeff. If you never had a chance to see his videos on youtube, do it now. The lessons just flow easily and keep you focused to the point where all you want to do is create.

Can't wait for the oil painting techniques.",1457395200,,298,4.321428571428571
7685048,5,B01CNN6CLM,"I have been a fan of Jeff Miracola's art for many years now and admired his creativity. A while back he started posting videos on you tube that showed bits and pieces of his techniques and various projects he was working on at the time. Watching the videos helped but it would always leave me with questions on techniques and materials which he would graciously take time out to answer the questions posted on you tube. I wasn't the only one with questions and Jeff saw there was a way he could help answer as many questions as he could by making a video set.

The skill building offered on the DVDs is so well presented that it never feels like lessons. Jeff is a natural teacher and the videos have things that regardless of your skill level, you WILL benefit from the DVDs. They touch from the very beginning of the process including thumbnails - to the actual painting process and beyond. Jeff is also very entertaining so expect a few smiles or even a laugh or two. I cannot recommend this DVD set enough.",1457308800,3,1010,4.43010752688172
7685049,5,B01CNN6CLM,"Very good instructional video, must buy for every level of artist.",1493164800,,66,5.090909090909091
7685050,5,B01CNN6CLM,"Great workshop, learned a lot.",1489276800,,30,5.2
7685051,5,B01CNN6CLM,"This is an absolute must for both the beginner and the professional.  Getting tutorials & other advice from an artist of Jeff's caliber is absolutely priceless.  He covers, in GREAT detail, his step by step approach and the thought process that occurs both before and during the painting process.

For anyone with an eye towards trying acrylics, this set will help alleviate your fears and definitely fill you with inspiration.  Jeff has a down to earth, no nonsense approach to painting taught in a friendly manner that should appeal to pretty much anyone.  Painting, and art in general can be intimidating.  Jeff's demonstrations and tips will push aside many of those fears and give you the know how to approach pretty much any acrylic painting problem.

The extras are worth the purchase price alone, with Jeff doing brushstroke demos, as well as a superb mini feature on building a portfolio.  That part alone, in my opinion is something EVERY aspiring artist should watch, and is really something that every art school should be showing their students.

And after watching the main feature, one can't help but be amazed as Jeff is able to effortlessly change gears on certain elements of his painting.  He is also a master at adding little touches that just enhance the magical atmosphere of his paintings.

If this ( and all the other ) extraordinary reviews don't convince you to get this DVD, I don't know what else to say!

Thank you, Jeff, for sharing this and your art with all of us.",1486857600,,1496,4.778210116731517
7685052,5,B01CNN6CLM,"Jeff's YouTube videos have been a great help to me. His art has been inspirational too. I bought this DVD and was amazed at how much additional info he had to share. If you are new to painting or have been at it for a few years, this DVD covers a lot of material. I found it really easy to apply his methods to my own work. Also the video and production quality is top notch. This is a good buy! Im eagerly awaiting the Oil Painting DVD that is coming in 2017.",1480636800,,460,3.956989247311828
7685053,5,B01CNN6CLM,I bought this through Jeff's original kickstarter and absolutely love it.  It has far better content than other art DVDs I've seen at a fraction of the cost.  Absolutely worth buying.,1480291200,,183,4.870967741935484
7685054,5,B01CNN6CLM,"Artist Jeff Miracola's is best know for his work on the Magic the Gathering Card game. He really does know his stuff. In the beginning of the lessons he says he hopes to inspire and help you add a few more techniques to your own arsenal when it comes to painting. If you would like a free look at how he does his work I highly suggest going over to his official you tube page. There you can see him in action in all sorts of media. To format his lessons Jeff uses a typical scenario of an assignment he would get from something like Magic The Gathering.
Next he then shows you from start to finish how he creates and completes an acrylic painting.
On the video he shows you how to prepare illustration board. However if you work on hardboard you can head over to you tube and see how Jeff prepares one himself.
The cool thing with this DVD set is that Jeff not only gives you one paining from start to finish he gives you 2. By the last dvd he takes you through a tour of his studio the kind of materials he uses and how he store his work as well. He also shows us several ways of how to present a portfolio at a convention. and also shows you how not to do it as well.
If your not into acrylics like I am but are into oils- You are in Luck because Jeff has launched a Kickstarter for an Oil painting dvd set. and anyone that works with this medium is highly encouraged to get it and add it to your collection of knowledge.",1479859200,2,1423,4.049645390070922
7685055,5,B01CNN6CLM,This is easily worth double the cost. Jeff's attitude and approach to acrylics are beyond inspiring. Happy to have this set and all of its information in my arsenal.,1479772800,,165,4.724137931034483
7685056,5,B01CNN6CLM,Ive followed Jeffs work for years since he started posting YouTube videos.  He is a great illustrator. Its always great to see an artist process and Jeff is very thorough in his information. The DVD is well produced; this has great information for a beginner and experienced illustrator as well. Interesting to see Jeff's Technique. I really enjoyed the DVD and would definitely recommend to my art friends.,1476316800,,407,4.985294117647059
7685057,5,B01CNN6CLM,"I first learned of Jeff Miracola from his YouTube channel, [...]Unlike most art or technique videos, his aren't just a time lapse of the entire painting, but portions of his process in real time. I found this far more informative and useful than a whole painting at warp speed. So when I learned that he was producing a full-length video of his acrylic techniques, I supported his Kickstarter campaign immediately, without reservation.

And I was certainly not disappointed. It is the complete package. He takes you through what he does, and WHY he does it, all in the context of an individual painting. He tells you why he makes the decisions that he does to support the painting and to let it communicate to its fullest potential. He doesn't give you the choices you should make for your own painting, rather he gives you insight into what questions may come up, and how he chose to address them.

I could go on, but the time you spend reading my words would be better spent listening to his. If you are considering this DVD at all, consider no longer. BUY IT. And don't be intimidated by it being called a ""Fantasy Art Workshop"". The information you can glean from this is highly applicable to anything you'd ever want to paint.

P.S. It is October 2016 as I write this, and he will soon be launching a similar project on Kickstarter, this time for oil painting. I will be supporting this. If you read this in time, you should support it as well. Money well spent.",1476230400,,1467,4.549242424242424
7685058,5,B01CNN6CLM,"Astoundingly good instruction. Thorough, high quality, and entertaining, this is an amazing resource for anyone wanting to get into painting. Worth every penny and more. My foot's tapping impatiently for the oil painting dvd.",1475971200,,225,5.647058823529412
7685059,5,B01CNN6CLM,"This set of DVDs is an outstanding source of information from a working professional artist. Not to put too fine a point on it:this guy makes his living at art. These videos show in minute detail how he does it. From conceptual thumbnails, preping the support to finished painting. No details are spared.
You would really have to book a full time artist to instruct you personally to match this. And that is IF you could find one who would do so and IF you could find one who happens to be a fantasy/sci-fi artist. Good luck.
This isn't really aimed at those want to paint kitty cats and flowers. Although they would also benefit from these DVDs. Fantasy art is a far more involved and compelling process (read:interesting) than most hobbyist artists may want to undertake. But if you want real world instruction from a successful working artist get these.",1475452800,,856,4.675496688741722
7685060,5,B01CNN6CLM,"This is without a doubt the best process video I've watched in recent years. Jeff is amazing and breaks his process down into clear and understandable steps. Follow along then apply what you learn and incorporate some of his practices into your own work.. for beginner to advanced artist.. there is always something to learn! You can feel his heart and soul in every brush stroke, glaze, and scumble!",1475452800,,400,4.811594202898551
7685061,5,B01CNN6CLM,"Jeff is a natural teacher -- knowledgeable, clear, concise, and funny. This is well worth your time and money, and I hope to see more from him in the future.",1475366400,,157,4.266666666666667
7685062,5,B01CNN6CLM,"I recently stumbled upon Jeff's YouTube channel as it was a ""suggested for your"" channel.  The colors and depth of the thumbnails immediately caught my eye and I clicked to watch.  After watching a couple videos, I saw a blip in one for the DVD set.  Clicked on it, watched the promo, and decided right then that this was something that needed to be my instructional DVD collection.  I am a commissioned artist primarily using an airbrush, but I also paint with soft body acrylics (used in the video), watercolor, and do some pencil/ink drawing.  Jeff states up front that this is not a ""paint along"" video, but a video designed to share and show his techniques for acrylic painting.  The entire process is covered beginning to end for the artwork that adorns the DVD cover.  Beginning with thumbnail sketching, final composition drawing, transferring the image, and painting start to finish.  Jeff also explains everything well as you follow along in the video.  As a semi-pro artist, the information in this video can be transferred/utilized in other art methods - creating textures, color balance/harmony, techniques, and much more - and that's just the first two DVD's for the main project.  Jeff then goes on to continue showing a variety of other acrylic painting tips, answering (good) questions about acrylic painting and the art process, a dragon painting, and good advice for building a portfolio for showing potential clients.  A+ Jeff.  This is a video I will go back and watch again and again, and recommend to anyone interested in acrylic painting.  Jeff also mentions that he is creating an oil painting DVD set.  I will buy it as well.  I'm not an oil painter at all, but as a serious artist, gaining knowledge of new techniques, mediums, and learning is a constant process and I am looking forward to Jeff's next installment.",1475280000,,1842,4.858974358974359
7685063,5,B01CNN6CLM,"Great DVD! Very informative, can't wait to start trying it techniques!",1468800000,,70,5.454545454545454
7685064,5,B01CNN6CLM,"I was a Kickstarter backer for Jeff Miracola's Fantasy Art Workshop, Acrylic Painting Techniques. I have followed and admired Jeff's work for years and was thrilled to hear that he was releasing a techniques DVD. Needless to say, I was not disappointed. Jeff is not only a wonderful artist, but he is also a fantastic and thorough teacher. This DVD is worth every penny...and more. The video quality terrific, the videography stays focused on the techniques being discussed, and Jeff's explanations are easy for a novice to understand and still packed with insight for the seasoned painter.

The viewer takes a journey with Jeff throughout the process of one entire painting--start to finish, composition to sealing. He also includes helpful hints along the way. In fact, there is so much packed into this DVD that it would be a must have at twice the price. Jeff's work is educational, and watching him work is inspirational. I highly recommend this DVD for anyone who paints with Acrylics--not just for fantasy artists.",1466380800,,1021,5.0058823529411764
7685065,5,B01CNN6CLM,"Jeff, I wanted to let you know how much I have appreciated your new CD set. I am far from a fantasy artist and do most of my realistic work in pastel and  oil. We are on different ends of the spectrum in subject and style but there was so much good information on your CDS there is no doubt you have expanded my parameters. I watch them over and over and learn something each time.",1464998400,,381,4.0131578947368425
7685066,5,B01CNN6CLM,"Speaking as a student currently studying illustration and visual development, I've come to learn the difference between great artists and great art teachers. Jeff Miracola is both. He is amazing at what he does and articulately demystifies the process of creating an illustration. Every phase is broken down allowing you to emulate his methods. Whether or not you're looking to paint in acrylics, I recommend this dvd as as it will help any student better understand picture making in terms of idea generation, reference gathering, preliminary drawings, theme, story, composition, values and color.",1464739200,,598,5.440860215053763
7685067,5,B01CNN6CLM,"Beautifully done, Jeff goes through the entire process from start to finish. Great video on fantasy illustration principles in acrylics.",1464739200,,136,5.85
7685068,5,B01CNN6CLM,Well done! Jeff clearly details his approach for creating fantasy art. I've taken away this workshop countless ideas to use for my own projects. Video quality and production were top-notch!,1463443200,,189,5.333333333333333
7685069,5,B01CNN6CLM,Jeff is the best! One the most informative step by step tutorials I've seen and my art is starting to progress from the information jeff shared on this dvd. This is a must buy for anyone looking to improve their art skills.,1462752000,,223,4.333333333333333
7685070,5,B01CNN6CLM,"I started seeing Jeff Miracola's videos on Youtube.com and loved them they were very helpful I wanted more!  I soon subscribed to his channel and sought him out on Facebook and Twitter, when I heard he was coming out with a workshop DVD I jumped on it ordering my copy!  I received it very promptly and it was signed and also more artwork inside was signed that I wasn't expecting AWESOME!!!  This DVD workshop is very well done from the lighting, being able to see everything nice and clear, when speaking very audible and packed with tons of information, inspiration and humour!!!  Jeff not only does a fantastic job with explainations of his craft, but his Wife Sylvia is the Bomb digitty behind the video camera.  Very professional look and quality but still giving a personal feel to it like he is talking right to you.  My only complaint is that it was only 6 hours, could have watched so much more!  For anyone who is aspiring to become a fantasy artist like myself or the person that already is they will enjoy watching this over and over and over, thanx Jeff!!!",1462665600,,1070,4.541666666666667
7685071,5,B01CNN6CLM,"As a fan of Jeff's YouTube videos, I pre-ordered this thru KickStarter. I have been messing with painting the last few years with no formal training. Watching his online videos gave me inspiration and I saw improvements in my work.
 The videos are very informative and Jeff makes learning a lot of fun. He has gone much further in depth than in his online videos and there is something for the everyone. Even though we differ in styles, subjects and materials it all relates. This set is worth every penny, Jeff has exceeded the expectations of ever fan, follower and Facebook friend who has purchased it!!!",1462665600,,607,4.726415094339623
7685072,5,B01CNN6CLM,"Not only is Jeff Miracola a great artist, but he's a great teacher. This goes above and beyond his YouTube channel and completely changes how I've thought about painting. It's fun to watch, and full of stuff that even pros will find interesting, new and exciting.",1462579200,,263,4.739130434782608
7685073,5,B01CNN6CLM,"This video was quite informative and very well made. Mr. Miracola does a fantastic job of stepping the viewer through his workflow and really trying to help us understand what techniques he's developed over the years as a professional, and why he's using them. Having years of experience doled in an easily digestible format is invaluable for anyone from beginners to those trying to break into an illustration profession.

The production values are top-notch, and Mr. Miracola has more than enough skill to justify making this. He knows exactly what he's doing and it 100% shows. Thankfully, there's no information missed and nothing more wanted or needed. There's no walking the viewer hand-in-hand through every step to make a painting, but he also doesn't leave us hanging, wondering how he accomplished a certain feeling, look, texture, or technique.

Definitely, check this out if you're an aspiring fantasy artist. It can only help, and adding it to my collection has helped me develop and be inspired as an artist.",1462579200,,1022,5.0773809523809526

7685076,5,B01CNN6CLM,I was fortunate enough to be able to preorder this as a Kickstart backer when Jeff first announced it last year. I recently finished watching the whole thing and I have to say it doesn't disappoint. Great production value on Jeff and Sylvia's part and it's laid out in a thorough and comprehensive manner. I had a great time following Jeff through the creative process and getting an insight into is work life. Anyone who is interested in high level illustration work of any sort would benefit from the video no matter the skill level. It is a lot of material and an excellent value. Despite being well over 4 hours worth of material I binge watched the whole thing including the extras in a couple of days. I'd also say that the replay value is high as he covers so much stuff I find myself wanting to watch it again soon. Great work Jeff and thanks for all the love and effort you put into it!,1462579200,,895,4.365269461077844
7685077,5,B01CNN6CLM,"I backed the kickstarter for this, so I had high hopes of what Jeff would present in this dvd set and those hopes were definitely met and then some.

Jeff takes you through his entire process of working on this painting, from initial thumbnail sketches all the way through to after it's finished with a nice wrap up discussion on what makes it a successful one. He breaks out of the painting process when it's important to give you specific tips that can aid you in your own paintings such as masking or safety tips like the type of mask you should wear when using spray adhesive.

Overall I believe that no matter what your level is as an artist you'll benefit from seeing Jeff's entire process. This DVD set is definitely worth the price of admission. But check out his YouTube channel if you want a taste of what to expect.",1460592000,,826,4.427631578947368
7685078,5,B01CNN6CLM,"Jeff Miracola is knowledgeable in painting techniques. This DVD set would be useful to both a pro and a beginner. Beyond being a great inspirational art process video, his thoughts on portfolio creation are very insightful.

Jeff is an amazing artist and the work that he and his wife have put into this DVD make this a must have for any artist collection. It is one of the best investments you can make for art instruction hands down. Covering all aspects of the creation of his painting from start to finish and giving valuable knowledge and tips all along the way. I would give more starts if amazon would let me! Not only informative but entertaining as well. Thank you Jeff for sharing your knowledge with the rest of the art world, we appreciate it.

Now we just need for him to to release a instructional DVD for oils :)",1459900800,,787,4.542253521126761
7685080,5,B01CNN6CLM,I have been a fan of Jeff on You Tube for a few years. This DVD series is great for the beginner or the master.  Great tips and awesome work ethic.  Awesome work.,1459296000,,162,3.878787878787879
7685081,5,B01CNN6CLM,I discovered Jeff while I was in art school searching for painting technique videos on youtube. He has since become one of my favorite artists. It's very easy to tell from his videos he loves his work and it carries over to his workshop video. I am confident whether you are a beginner or an old vet you will learn some valuable insight that will improve your painting techniques.,1459209600,,380,4.521739130434782
7685082,5,B01CNN6CLM,"This is a great instructional video choke full of tips and insights into Jeff's process.

He covers everything from start to finish and even helped turned me on to a few new ideas that I hadn't even thought of with my limited experience with acrylic painting. Definitely a useful video for any novice or intermediate exploring acrylic painting and fantasy illustration. Thanks Jeff!,1459123200,,344,5.052631578947368
7685084,5,B01CNN6CLM,"Jeff is so very easy to understand and follow.

I have studied a lot or different artist's work and he is the best one I've seen at being able to bring you along for the ride. He inspires you to go your own way and offers you more than one way of doing any particular step. There are a lot of hours to watch here, but they seem to go by in no time. The work that he and Silvia put into this REALLY shows. The lighting, camera shots and editing is second to none.

If you want to learn organically from a teacher that you feel like he'd be a friend if you met him in real life, this is your DVD.

I can't say enough good about it. I am already using the steps he showed me.
I recommend this workshop for any beginner or professional.

Many thanks to you Jeff!
P.S. ......So when are you and Silvia  making a sequel? lol",1458950400,,818,3.9634146341463414

7685087,5,B01CNN6CLM,This is by far on one of the most detailed and informative instructional DVDs out there for Acrylic Painting. Not only is it extremely informative but it's entertaining as well. Jeff Miracola adds his great sense of humor and love for art all through this DVD. You can honestly tell from watching this that he loves what he is doing and loves to share his knowledge of painting. I highly recommend this for everyone from those just starting in the area of painting to professionals.,1458777600,,482,4.682352941176471
7685088,5,B01CNN6CLM,"The discovery of Jeff's YouTube videos was invaluable to me as a beginning painter. I learned so much in such a short time and my abilities improved (and continue to improve) with each viewing. Jeff is very personable and makes things very easy to understand without dumbing anything down. This DVD set takes his insight to the next level, showing the painting process from inception to conclusion and really is full of great info. Tips, tools, materials, shortcuts etc. are all covered here in a fun and often enlightening way. Whether a beginner or a pro, this DVD will inform and entertain. Thank you Jeff Miracola for making your experience and knowledge available to the rest of us! I'm ready for Volume 2!",1458777600,,711,4.788617886178862
8753453,5,B01CNN6CLM,"I love every one of Jeff and Sylvia's videos and I highly recommend them to any artist. This Acrylic Painting Workshop is no exception. Jeff's approach to teaching is wonderful, because he refuses to dominate you with rules you have to follow or arbitrary barriers that separate a real artist from a looked-down-upon hobbyist, but instead opts to take you on a journey through his own process and preferences. At the same time, he is very thorough in making sure you understand what, why, and how he's doing what he's doing at every step. There is an insane amount of quality content for the cost as well. I've seen some popular artists selling DVD's for upwards of $100 and all that's included is a one angle shot of them painting on a board with little organized commentary. That's not Jeff's style. He keeps his thoughts organized, edits himself into the best possible presentation for YOU to learn.

As always, the videos are high quality and well-edited. You can tell that they put a lot of work into this program. You won't be sitting through a four hour demo with the painter's occasional quiet murmering that only serves the purpose of putting you to sleep. Jeff and Sylvia manage to bring an element of fun into the program, but not so much that it feels hokey or non-serious either.",1518480000,,1292,4.666666666666667
8753454,5,B01CNN6CLM,"Speaking as a SF&F illustrator of two decades, sharing many of the same brands as Jeff, these vids made me want to pick up Acrylics again!  Brilliantly informative demos, with a humour only Jeff can supply!",1517875200,,206,4.722222222222222
8753455,5,B01CNN6CLM,"This is by far the best instructional painting video I've ever come across. While Jeff's YouTube channel is extremely informative, this workshop goes miles beyond the pale, offering an in-depth (and I mean IN-DEPTH) look at the entire process of creation by a modern master. From the tools, to prepping your surface, to proper explanations of techniques such as glazing, scumbling, masking, this video covers EVERYTHING. The short ""Professor Jeff"" asides are pretty amusing, too. I've had the pleasure of meeting Jeff a few times, and his awesome and friendly personality shows through in every second of this how-to masterpiece. Spend the money. Get some quality learnin'. You won't regret it at all.

P.S. If you're a digital artist, get it anyway. So many of the techniques Jeff covers have helped my digital process, not to even mention the leaps I've made in my traditional work thus far.",1517875200,,893,5.033783783783784

8753457,5,B01CNN6CLM,"This is far and away the best instructional art DVD out there. If you do nothing but play the 4 discs in the background while you paint (which is what I do) you'll find yourself working in a calm, relaxed manner and you'll be soaking up tons of info without even realising it. Superb presentation overlaid with beautiful acoustic guitar; Jeff and his missus are professional, funny, knowledgeable and best of all genuine people who go out of their way to ensure you have a fun time and that you'll be a much better artist after your hours spent with them. Great stuff!",1517875200,,568,4.524271844660194

8753459,5,B01CNN6CLM,"Miracola - has a wonderful view of the medium. Overall his work is insightful and thorough. He pauses whenever there is a neat tid-bit of info to share. He is likable and personable. The only thing that really bugged me was the music. The ""Professor tips"" music more than the regular one is just annoying. I know he did it to NOT TAKE HIMSELF SERIOUSLY...but it really is annoying. I thought that alone took away from the flow of the film. The editing is really good, the angles of the video are also well designed, so I guess the music kept it from being perfect. I recommend this to anyone looking to do a quickstart to painting. ANY LEVEL - ADVANCED will enjoy it and get some good insight. Only one that I think he forgot was Glyserine to slow the drying time.",1511827200,,764,4.34965034965035
