7936590,4,B00005B200,"The Adventures of Justine is a series of seven films, sold separately or sold together as a collection. At first glance one may mistake The Adventures of Justine for one of those ubiquitous perky, adolescent TV shows. Lithe and lovely Justine (Daneen Boone) could easily be a Nancy Drew character and Professor Paul Robson (Timothy Dipri) seems to have been given an Indiana Jones persona. However, one realizes very soon that Justine's adventures are not so innocent.

Justine is a precocious teenage student and Professor Robson is a facility member at the Topacre Academy for gifted young girls. Justine along with several of the other girls are infatuated with the be-speckled but handsome Professor. Justine, who is ostensibly a virgin, and the Professor seem to get dragged into one international quest after another and while Justine manages, to her chagrin, (she desires to be de-flowered by the Professor) to remain innocent, her dreams and fantasies do not.

Justine and the Professor manage to get involved with a group of bad guys in each adventure, usually with Justine being captured but never violated, even while, people all around her, good and bad, are engaging in sex, which, by the way, Justine often watches.

Although Justine never physically takes part in any of the numerous sex scenes, she has a vivid imagination and occasionally gets seduced in one of her dreams. Her spunky roommate Ursula (Kimberly Rowe) and house mother, Madame Souvray (Jennifer Behr) are both sexually active and are often portrayed in simulated sex situations, as are the various nefarious ladies depicted in each film.

In Object of Desire, Justine once again manages to arrive at a foreign location, with her hearts desire, Professor Robson. Co-incidently, Justine and Paul, (Robson) both travel to Shanghai, she to meet her father and he to receive a huge, rare, exotic ruby which they manage to lose, recover and lose again, amidst sinister murder plots and foreign intrigue. A gratuitous quantity of erotica are the norm in this story, which take the viewer from the exotic Orient, to the enchanting provinces of Spain.

What`s Good

* Beautiful people, good casts

* Excellent bodies (male and female)

* Well done, though not overly suggestive sex scenes

* atmospheric cinematography

* a bouncy, somewhat jocular quality

What's Bad

* Low budget and it shows

* weak plots/stories

* Sex scenes seem sanitized (dispassionate)

* mediocre acting

* limited features

Conclusion

Despite the fact that the plot is lame and the story has more holes than a back woods, stop sign, the overall effect of this film, for me at least, is positive. If a soft-core film can be wholesome, this would be it. Each story is kind of a rehash of the preceding story, with some different characters, outside the nuclear cast (teachers and classmates). There doesn't seem to be a continuing story, so it is not necessary to view more than one flick, unless you so chose.

So there you have it, ""wholesome soft-porn"" (is that an oxymoron?). It's not bad. It's something stimulating that you can watch without feeling perversive. Check it out. 4 stars.",1131062400,8,3141,5.005769230769231
7936591,5,B00005B200,"Cute little mini-series, kind of a ""serious-comedy""; Adventures revolve around Justine a student at a private girls school and her Professor Robson. This is the 3rd of the series and it involves the loss of a large ruby. Most of the short stories involve archeological and antiquities adventures. Another excellent shower sceen this time with KIMBERLY ROWE. Plenty of nice nude sceens of Daneen and a few of her friends...",1012348800,9,422,5.042857142857143
