8630113,4,B00H51U6EW,"If you like WW2 action Pacific-style, you should be well satisfied with this double feature.  ""Wake Island"" (1942) details how a garrison of U.S. Marines fought off the Japanese Armed Forces for two weeks starting on 12-07-41.  Just previous to that, the Marine officers are honoring a Washington D.C.-bound Japanese diplomat, played by the inevitable and oily Richard Loo, at a formal dinner.  When the diplomat offers a soothing toast to peace between Japan and the U.S.A., the Americans look askance  at one another.  Following shortly thereafter is the sneak attack which bombs the defenses of Wake Island.  Brian Donlevy is strong and restrained as the Major, Albert Dekker irascible as an officer-hating civilian contractor, and Robert Preston and William Bendix lively as two incorrigible privates.  You have to accept the model ships as 1940s-vintage special effects.  Movie was filmed at California's Salton Sea.  My favorite scene is Donlevy swigging down a gulp of Pabst Blue Ribbon in between mowing down waves of enemy soldiers charging through the sand dunes.  We can all be proud of how hard these Marines dug in and fought.

  ""No Man Is an Island"" (1962), a U.S./Philippines production, is based on the true story of U.S. Navy Radioman George R. Tweed, who fled to the hinterlands of the Pacific island Guam when the Japanese attacked on 12-07-41.  He is one of five sailors but the only one to survive.  The people of Guam, derisively called ""Fishheads"" by some Americans, risk their lives to hide and protect Tweed.  He and his radio make their way to a leper colony, a place shunned by the Japanese.  From there, with a kid's typewriter and home-make typing ribbons, Tweed produces a crude newspaper with truthful news that is smuggled and secretly read by the population of Guam.  Tweed is chased around by the Japanese, whom he is driving crazy.  Jeffrey Hunter, an actor of startling handsomeness and sky-blue eyes, ably plays the elusive Tweed, who learns to love the poor but brave and freedom-loving island people.  It's a film that I am glad to have seen again after many decades.",1491004800,,2107,4.948717948717949
