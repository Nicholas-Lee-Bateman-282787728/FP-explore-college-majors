4499426,5,B004YG7JPK,"This set of DVD's is some of the most informational and comprehensive set of DVD's for any photographer using speedlights with their photography. David makes the process really simple and teaches you how to think for yourself and solve your own individual lighting problems with this DVD. Great buy, Great value!",1304553600,2,312,5.137254901960785
4499427,5,B004YG7JPK,"You will learn lighting as a professional by watching a professional
at work without cuts. It is all there, the goofs, the interactions, the decisions, and of course the magic.
To make a professional photograph of a subject takes more then lighting and David hobby takes you inside his creative mind and shows you his on-site workflow and interactions with the subjects.
Talking to the model/subject and getting the emotion is one of the most overlooked areas of portraits.
There is a great bonus in this series as he discusses his business model.
Having a good business education is crucial when starting your own company whether it be photography or any other venture.
Worth every penny.",1304467200,2,689,4.948275862068965
4499428,5,B004YG7JPK,"I attended the Flash Bus Tour. I've been a regular reader of Strobist for a couple of years now. I even got to shake his hand in Buffalo. I knew I wanted to watch these DVD's, but the question I asked myself, and the question I hear (or read) many people asking: are these DVD's ""worth it""?

Well, yes. They are more than worth it. They do several things for you.

They consolidate information that is otherwise all over the place... and all over Strobist. Strobist is well worth the 100-some-odd hours I have spent reading it. The information may be buried back a few years, but it's there. These DVD's allow lots of this information to bubble to the surface all over again. Now I'm mixing metaphors... oh well.

They recapitulate information. Many themes come full circle if you are a regular reader of David's website. This helps solidify the information in a more cohesive way.

You can see the practical application of the information. And perhaps even more useful, you can see how he interacts with subjects, which is just as important as what power settings you should be using, if not more so.

So basically there are six major shoots, most broken down into an action sequence and a more formal portrait. I loved the first two disks (model and a blacksmith), as well as the sixth (the last official one). The last one was superb.

Additionally, there are several ""talking head"" moments where David shares some business thoughts, as well as some detail on his HoCo360 project.

My only qualms *might* be that I wish there were a couple more shoots packed in. Or... maybe a ""beefier"" middle section of the series. The fourth shoot (soccer) seemed a bit rushed or more informal to me. I liked the fifth shoot (beekeeper), but felt it was sadly too short. Each DVD has new information and techniques to offer, but at least the soccer one could have been more detailed.

Initially I thought all the sections on HoCo360 were too specific and not very ""rewatchable"", but they do still offer a lot of insight. You need to simply envision yourself in his shoes, at some point in your future. It is, as he says, a compass point. Perhaps those could have been made into slightly more universal business tips, and slightly less anecdotal, if I HAD to nitpick. But really, they still offer a lot to think about.

All in all, these are great DVD's and I will be rewatching most, if not all of them at least once more. They are definitely worth it, and they are MORE than worth it if you've ever read more than a handful of Strobist articles. David does a great job of making 99% of his information and experience free. It is thus a very easy way to donate to the ongoing cause, and pick up something a bit more visual than just reading the blog. They complement everything on there very well.

Highly recommended. Thanks David, for really opening up a whole new world of photography (or more specifically, photographic lighting) for so many of us.",1304380800,7,2941,4.574144486692015

8448253,5,B004YG7JPK,"David Hobby is a trip, strobist blog, so much info your head will explode. I watch these videos while I eat dinner rather than I Love Lucy re-runs",1379030400,,146,4.25
8448254,1,B004YG7JPK,"I am sure there are some good tips along the way in these videos but first of all, it's boring. After watching the first dvd for 30 minutes, I got bored, shut it off and never watched again. I don't know how people give 5 stars! Paid $159.95 and I don't think it's worth the price.",1353196800,2,281,4.035714285714286
8448255,4,B004YG7JPK,"I've been shooting for 13 years and never really taken the time to dial in speed light work.  Studio strobes, sure, but eventually I got sick of tugging around my older model giants.  Now I can carry everything I need (not stands and such obviously) in one bag along with my camera and get the same results.  My strobes live in studio, and my speedlights go out and make me money.

These DVD's helped me to understand the nuances of my speedlights and more importantly, how to tweak them effectively when using other natural light sources.  The split screen is a nice touch when he's shooting because you don't need to go back and see what he's referencing after the fact.  Lighting notebooks are good as well.  Music is acceptably ignorable.

For technique these bad boys do a great job.  That said, I've seen people praising his ability to banter and talk to the models.  He aint as funny as he thinks he is, and sometimes he veers into creepy awkward territory.  If you work like this, you're not doing the business a courtesy.  Photographers get enough flack for being skeezy already.  I've had many a client tell me they worked with so and so who had a really nice set up but crossed lines that made them uncomfortable and the photographer was oblivious to his (usually a man) inappropriate demeanor.  Mr. Strobist is not wildly inappropriate, nor am I a prude, but some of his comments blipped on my creep meter.  If you want to learn how to talk to relative strangers on the fly, go take some improv classes.

You should probably spend the 150.  It'll pay for itself quickly.  Support the effort, ya dig?",1335744000,3,1611,4.554006968641115
8448256,5,B004YG7JPK,I purchased this DVD set for my boyfriend and he loved it! He said he had learned more in 20 minutes than he had reading tutorials online for almost a year.,1327536000,,156,4.064516129032258

Unlike a myriad of other resources for learning off-camera flash photography, this is one that lets you get into the mind of one of the best, and to follow his thoughts on how to construct a scene.  This is usually accomplished three ways: firstly, how to get the scene (how many times have YOU thought 'damn, if only I had the opportunity to shoot this in a rustic shed' etc), how to make the scene work for you with regards to where you physically want to place your lights, and how to balance your lights to get your shot (some scenes have a different emphasis).
Fortunately, there is much troubleshooting done along the way (this DVD would suck if you just saw Hobby come along, set up lights and take a few perfect frames before moving on), and given that this is basically an insight into how Hobby operates, you will learn how to take some shots and make them look how you visualise them.  Well at least that's what I'm getting from it.

The final parts of each chapter are great; you get an explanation of all the things that were going on in the scene, just in case they went by a little quickly.

I really believe there is something for almost everybody in here. If you're new to flash photography, you are in luck!  You just need to run through Strobist's Lighting 101 course (will take an hour or so), then put this DVD on.  Just make sure you know what changing ISO/aperture/shutter speed do for your exposure and you're set.
And if you're pretty good at flash photography, this DVD is still for you.

NB: I bought the downloaded version (so I can watch it on my iPad at my leisure - and it works excellent this way!), so I'll make no comments on the DVD quality.  To gain an idea of the (video) camera work, I recommend you watch the trailer.  This DVD is about the content, not the professional filming (it might have an extra zero on the end if this was the case), but I hasten to add it is certainly much better quality than a stock standard home video.  This point definitely does not detract from the review.",1326240000,,2044,4.383597883597884
8448258,5,B004YG7JPK,"First off Mr. Strobist (aka David Hobby) has been my main goto blog for everything flash photography.
I have been checking his site daily for a few years now and it is by far the best place for info/ tips/ dyd stuff/ and all around good people.
This site alone provides more information than you can possibly ever retain and David seems to have streamlined a lot of the best stuff into this dvd.

iPhone/ iPad ready videos to load right on to your mobile device was a really nice touch. Always nearby if I need some inspiration or some help with some lighting.
He walks you through multiple shoots and talks you through what's going on in his head.
Lots of great info on here and easily worth the $$.

If you are into flashing stuff (with a camera) then do yourself a big fav and get it.
I guarantee are your pics won't stink any where near as bad  as they usually do!

Thanks David, keep em coming.",1307664000,4,899,4.270588235294118
8448259,5,B004YG7JPK,"I stumbled onto Strobist a few weeks ago and became mesmerized by David Hobby's ability to light anything. And, I was completely astounded that he provided all of this extremely valuable information for FREE. When I saw these DVDs up for grabs, I felt that I needed to support David simply for all the stuff I already learned from his blog. The DVDs rock the set. They are fantastic in every way. There's tons of technical lighting stuff but also business insights and a whole host of great content. What I love best besides the knowledge contained in the DVDs is the DVD ROM that has all the other DVDs on it in H.264. I was skeptical how they would look on my Apple TV & 42"" flat screen but they look awesome! The quality is fantastic and it saved me having to rip the whole set. I can't recommend this product enough. It's a tremendous wealth of information to anyone interested in lighting. I have not checked out his other set of DVDs but I assume they ""start from scratch"" whereas Lighting in Layers jumps right in. I would have felt overwhelmed if I hadn't read, marked and inwardly digested David's Strobist blog. Be sure to read Lighting 101 and the On Assignment pages as an appetizer to these DVDs if you are full + green with this lighting stuff. ;)  Thanks for making this product David! It's awesome!",1307145600,3,1314,4.475
8448260,5,B004YG7JPK,"If you've learned the basics of photography (or frankly, are even a very good photographer with natural light but haven't yet ventured into the world of off-camera lighting), and want to know how to create your own lighting scenarios for your shoots with a _practical_ budget, then this will change your photography life.

David does an excellent job of showing some studio work and on the job shoots using off camera lighting, and this DVD set will just give you a practical view into how some pro shoots are done without needing tens of thousands of bucks in equipment. This is where David's well known ""strobist.com"" style methodology pays off, in that a photographer with an average budget (a few hundred bucks over their existing equipment) can really benefit from his advice and experience.

The fun part is the format where as David goes through his shoots, you see the pics in a split screen format as they are taken, so you can see the effect of the things he does in real life (move the stand here, adjust the power here, etc) on the resultant pic immediately. This is very important to learning how to look at your own shoots and how adjustments can be made to translate your ideas into your pictures.

After you feel comfortable with your camera and pictures (and even if you're advanced but haven't done off-camera lighting), this DVD set is a must have.

EDIT: Is it worth $160 (price at time of this review)? Face it, you're going to spend a few hundred bucks on some lighting equipment (stand, flash, umbrella, mini-soft box, etc.). If you don't think so now consider that pros spend tens of thousands on this stuff. This DVD set will save you at least the purchase price in knowing what to spend on the right stuff for what you want to do. I'll admit to going out and spending 200 bucks on new equipment after watching this DVD, but I think that I'm now taking pictures that would have taken me _far_ more in bad purchases and bad experiences to take otherwise. I feel like a new photographer on a budget for what this has let me focus on buying and using well.",1307145600,5,2078,4.548128342245989
8448261,4,B004YG7JPK,"I'm a big fan of David Hobby's work, website, etc. I was a bit concerned about the price of this set, its fairly expensive. But no need to worry, its well worth it.

The DVDs explain how to get great photos with very little equipment. Most of the shots are taken without any fancy wireless triggers, just inexpensive small strobes.

Very clear, good coverage of the details. Wonderful results. Each disk takes about an hour. High video quality.",1307145600,3,444,4.67948717948718
