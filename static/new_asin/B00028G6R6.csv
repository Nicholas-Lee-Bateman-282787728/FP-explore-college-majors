2068670,5,B00028G6R6,"I recently looked into my crystal ball and saw all the outcomes of SUMMERSLAM. I looked even further into the ball and breifley saw the card to the RAW exclusive NO MERCY!
Here is what i saw
Main Event: Shawn Michaels v.s Chris Benoit v.s Chris Jericho (triple threat match for the World heavyweight championship)
Has there ever been a No Mercy main event like this before, no way. This could be the match of the night, match of the year, the greatest match of all time? Just wait till October to find out!
Christian v.s Edge (Intercontinental championship, single TLC match!)
Christian was able to defeat Shelton Benjamin on RAW for the title the night after being beaten by Shawn Michaels at Summerslam. Edge wanted the title and he wanted to prove he is the better brother. This will be the No Mercy 2001 rematch, but this time, a chair and a table is added to the mix.
Randy Orton v.s Ric Flair
This is a result of Randy Orton ""killing"" the legend of Ric Flair when Flair shaked The Rocks hand after the brauma bull beat the nature boy at Summerslam. With HHH making a movie and Flair kicked from Evolution, Orton and Batista have been on a tag team tear leading to this match. Batista will be at ringside for the match.
Kane and A-train v.s The Hardy Boyz (world tag team titles)
The unstoppable team of Kane and A-train won the titles from La Resistance in just 3 minutes on RAW only 2 weeks away from this event. The newly reformed Hardy Boyz won a tag team tormoil match and got the title shot at this PPV.
Rhyno v.s Batista (hardcore title)
The gauntlet for the hardcore title began just after Summerslam, and this is the final match in the tournament. Will Randy Orton get involved, or could an old ECW superstar come to the aid of Rhyno?
My crystal ball also picked up a happening from the actual event itself.
After Rhyno is able to get the win, following help from Tajiri, Randy Orton and Batista challange the fromer ECW superstars to a match straight after the hardcore match!
Rhyno and Tajiri v.s Randy Orton and Batista (ECW v.s WWE tag team match)
Shelton Benjamin v.s Tyson Tomco w/Trish Stratus
Shelton will receive a push after this PPV, and this match was just a way to get him on the card.
Also at the PPV:
Will be the first ever edition of Stacy Keiblers talk show ""talk tease"". Her first guest will be Eugene!
So if the crystal ball readings are true, then WWE fans could be in for a treat at WWE NO MERCY!",1086825600,,2431,4.404444444444445
2068691,1,B00028G6R6,"With a generic cover of JBL smiling and the No Mercy sign in a dollar bill, I should have seen disaster coming.  But like an idiot, I plunged into it anyway.  And I will make up for my regret by telling everyone just how awful it was.

Eddie Guerrero vs Luther Reigns
I swear, the match was secondary to the commentary.  The match was as dull as they come, with little more than cheap punches, kicks, and stomps, and the occasional headlock, but all you ever heard was from Michael Cole and Tazz ""OMG look at Luther Reigns!""  ""He used to be a mercenary"" ""He survived getting his throat cut""  ""He's a hardass OMG"".  It was a horrible match, ending with a fake hit with a police baton in memory of Ray Traylor, the Big Boss Man who died recently.  (0/10)

Spike Dudley vs Nunzio
Not only are these two cruiserweights, but they're both ECW originals.  The bookers in this time must not have known what to do with them, because they were reduced to mere brawlers with a few flying moves.  This one was hopelessly boring with a predictable ending.  (1/10)

Billy Kidman vs Paul London
Considering that these two are high flyers, I expected a cruiserweight high-flying bout of epic proportions in very un-WWE style.  Alas, I've been spoiled by ECW, ROH, even old WWF.  What I got instead was two high flyers acting like brawlers.  Except for the occasional high impact ATTEMPT and the Shooting Star Press, this was little more than a brawl, more suited for a Hardcore Holly vs John Cena match.

The storyline behind this one was awful as well.  After a legitimate botch of the Shooting Star Press, Billy Kidman injures Chavo Guerrero Jr., and what does the WWE do?  They turn Kidman into the heel because he's afraid of hurting people with the SSP again.  Inexplicably, he turns against Paul London, and is villainized because of his concern for others' well-being.  An angle that ranks down there with Katie Vick. (0/10)

WWE Tag Team Championship
Rob Van Dam and Rey Mysterio vs Kenzi Suzuki and Rene Dupree (C)
With RVD and Rey Mysterio in the match, I'd've thought this would be a good one.  Instead, in typical WWE style, their wings were cut, and Kenzo Suzuki showed just how limited his wrestling skills are.  Either that, or the WWE decided to bill him as a brawler.  The match was a dud when there shouldn't have been one.  I'm shocked Smackdown bookers could fumble this one so badly.  (3/10)

The Big Show vs Kurt Angle
This match had two parts, before Angle counted himself out and after Theodore Long restarted the match as a result.  Before, The Big Show was dominating Angle like Mark Henry dominates John Q. Rassler on an average episode of Smackdown.  Afterwards, Angle started fighting back, but why bother?  The match was over as soon as Angle was counted out---boring, dull, listless.  It's as if the bookers went on coffee break and just told Angle ""don't even bother fighting""  (0/10)

WWE United States Championship
John Cena vs Booker T (C)
Any match with Cena in it is almost guaranteed for failure.  Still, Booker T tried, and for that I give him credit.  Cena gave little for Booker to work with.  It was as if the bookers told them, ""Let Cena win, but make him look like he worked hard for it"" and Cena ignored that order.  (0/10)

Charlie Haas, Rico, and Miss Jackie vs The Dudley Boys and Dawn Marie
This one was not a wrestling match by any degree.  The Dudleys hardly did anything, while most of the match was Bubba freaking out by being kissed by Rico, and D-Von being afraid to headbutt Rico's crotch---with Rico waving him in.  Aside from this, Rico is an amazing athlete, with martial arts skills he wields in the ring, and Charlie Haas got to pull off some awesome wrestling moves before the match was pitifully over.  (6/10)

WWE Championship
John Bradshaw Layfield (C) vs The Undertaker
JBL is hardly a great wrestler, and The Undertaker looks amazing only when pitted against even semi-decent wrestlers.  This match had virtually no actual wrestling moves save for two chokeslams and a Tombstone Piledriver.  The rest was punches, kicks, stomps, and a top-rope shoulder block by Bradshaw.  This was an overly long, not very exciting match that had the decency to move much of the action out of the ring for our entertainment.  Considering that The Undertaker was dominating JBL for 90% of the matchup, it was a lousy main event, with an even lousier ending that just spared JBL from further bouts with the Undertaker, and started a new storyline with The Undertaker and Heidenreich.  (2/10)

The perfect example of how pitifully far the WWE has fallen since WCW died, this pay per view had everything the dumb mark (wrestling term) would want---punches, kicks, headlocks, stomps, and shoulderblocks galore!",1187654400,,4740,4.680387409200969
2068692,4,B00028G6R6,"Eddie Guerrero vs. Luther Reigns - This was Luther's best match in his short WWE career as this was a good opener to get the crowd going.  It's slow at times but overall, enjoyable & the ending with Eddie ""lyin', cheatin', and stealin'"" is just classic Guerrero.

Spike Dudley vs. Nunzio - The DVD I rented had a scratch on this part & kept skipping so I can't comment.

Paul London vs. Billy Kidman - I must be dreaming because there are two crusierweight matches on the same card!  They actually had a good storyline going into this match along with Kidman having a personality for the first time since his fued with Hulk Hogan (which I'm sure most of us would like to forget).  These two mesh well together & is actually one of the best matches of the night & the aftermath with the shooting star presses were something to see.

WWE Tag Team Champions Kenzo Suzuki & Rene Dupri vs. RVD & Rey Mysterio - Just like this PPV gave Reigns the best match of his career, this PPV also gave Kenzo Suzuki the best match of his career.  It was very fast paced which works well in the favor of RVD & Mysterio.  Watchable & solid.

Big Show vs. Kurt Angle - This was one of the best Big Show matches he's had in his career as he's going for revenge after he was ""raped of his dignity"" (tribute to Andre The Giant).  It was a great performance out of both since Angle sold his ""fear"" of Show while Show looked ruthless.

United States Champion Booker T vs. John Cena - This was the last match of their series and this was another solid encounter as Booker T was one of the guys who brought out the best in John Cena.  Back & forth action here and was another enjoyable performance for the night.

Dudleyz & Dawn Marie vs. Rico, Charlie Hass, Miss Jackie - This was based off a storyline where Dawn Marie was implying that she was having an affair with Charlie Hass...who was engaged to Miss Jackie.  The match itself was suppost to be a filler but turned out to be very enjoyable as Rico's gimmick made the match comedic at times such as begging for D-Von to give him the ""Whazzup!"" headbutt to his crotch.  Good solid match up.

Last Ride Match: WWE Champion JBL vs. Undertaker - This was a brutal brawl including chair shots & steel steps between the two that heavily makesup for their lackluster SummerSlam encounter.  One of JBL's best encounters and a good way to end the show.

The DVD extras that I can remember were a post match Cena interviews with Luther Reigns & John Cena along with a pre-match interview with Booker T.  Overall, this was one of the best SmackDown PPV's of the year (the other being No Way Out earlier that year) and is a solid PPV from top to bottom that I recommend.",1178841600,3,2687,4.327345309381237

Then to determine how the show ranks the total of the matches scores are divided by the number of matches giving the grade and a comment about whether you should buy it or not. The grading system is as follows.

Grading E- = 0 - 8.33%-Waste of time and money.

  E  = 8.33 - 16.66%-Waste of time and money.

  E+ = 16.66 - 24.99%-Waste of time and money.

  D- = 24.99 - 33.32%-Very poor event maybe read about it.

  D  = 33.32 - 41.65%-Poor event with a little something standing out.

  D+ = 41.65 - 50%-Not a very good event but it just below passing.

  C- = 50 - 55.55%-Just below average worth a watch.

  C  = 55.55 - 61%-An average event worth a renting.

  C+ = 61 - 66.65%-Above average worth a purchase if you can find it for cheap.

  B- = 66.65 - 72.20%-Good event with a lot of good stuff. Purchase if you're a collector or interested.

  B  = 72.20 - 77.75%-Good quality event which is worth purchase and should be collected.

  B+ = 77.75 - 83.30%-Very high quality event with awesome matches. Must have for anyone.

  A- = 83.30 - 88.85%-Excellent event, must have for anyone. Lock this one away.

  A  = 88.85 - 94.40%-Extremely spectacular event with lots of great stuff. Lock this away.

  A+ = 94.40 - 100%-DVD of the century, must buy and keep in a very safe place.

Match One-Eddie Guerrero Vs Luther Reigns-This was a hot opening match with some good stuff involved,some lieing,cheating and stealing used,even some good work from good old Luther. This has a nice ending with a tribute to one of the true hard men of the WWE. My rating 8.71/10.

Match Two-Cruiserweight Championship-Spike Dudley(C)Vs Nunzio-This was a pleasantly good match and it had some interference which really spiced this nice match up. Hopefully WWE continue to have lots of cruiserweight matches as they're really good. My rating 8.81/10.

Match Three-Billy Kidman Vs Paul London-This was excellent,two cruiserweight matches in a row,now thats good. This had some great high flying moves and a great ending with it. It had some aftermath which was great and I thoroughly enjoyed this match with its fast paced action. My rating 8.91/10.

Match Four-WWE Tag Team Championship-Kenzo Suzuki & Rene Dupre(C)Vs RVD & Rey Mysterio-This was a fastly paced match with some nice action and some good spots. It wasn't the greatest match these four coud have put on but it was still very good indeed. I hope these two teams continue to feud amongst themselves and with other teams as its really enjoyable and exciting. My rating 8.86/10.

Match Five-Big Show Vs Kurt Angle-This match was great compared to most of Big Show's matches. Kurt and Show put on a great performance here and it really showed big time. Great spots,bumps and action throughout this match. Show and Kurt should really continue this, as its exciting and they could really go somewhere with it. My rating 8.95/10.

Match Six-US Title-Booker T(C)Vs John Cena-This was the fifth and final match in these two mens series of matches for the US title. The action was back and forfth and you couldn't guess the winner til the bell rung to signal the winner. It was an excellent match with some great action. Keep up the great work men. My rating 8.99/10.

Match Seven-Jackie,Rico & Charlie Haas Vs D-Von Dudley,Buh Buh Ray Dudley & Dawn Marie-This match was announced a week or two prior to this event with Dawn spiling the beans about Charlie and Jackie being engaged. The match itself wasn't that great but it was still enjoyable and helped the crowd get excited for the main event. My rating 7.41/10.

Match Eight-Main Event-Last Ride Match-WWE Championship-JBL(C)Vs The Undertaker-This was purely brutal with everything they could do being done in this match. Tombstones,Chokeslams and everything,chair shots, stairs used anything used in this brutal match. It was absolutely great and the ending did what it needed to,setting up future feuds. A great main event to end a very good show. My rating 9.76/10.

In my opinion No Mercy 2004 was a great show with lots of very good matches with a great main event. Now lets see how it scored, the score is in and it is 70.30 out of 80 which is equal to 87.87%. Thats a great score which is equal to an A-. I hope this review helps you, feel free to vote on this or any other of my reviews.",1124496000,,4395,4.627756160830091

EDDIE GUERRERO defeated LUTHER REIGNS: With 2 cruiserweight & 2 tag matches, this sure was a strange choice for an opener. I had a feeling it would be early on the card though, and it wasn't a totally terrible decision. Started off well enough, but it soon deteriorated into the typical big man vs smaller man match. The psychology in Luther attacking Eddie's back, worked to a certain point, but it all went on a little long (thus resulting in Luther pretty much looking like the prototypical hoss, which I don't think he is). When all was said & done, 2-3 minutes of restholds needed to be shaved off the 13 minute duration. Decent ending sequence carried by Eddie, where (in a tribute to The Big Bossman) he stole a baton/nightstick from a ringside policeman. Match Rating...6

SPIKE DUDLEY defeated NUNZIO to Retain the CruiserWeight Title: Above average cruiserweight match which proves how important this division is to the SmackDown roster (and especially it's ppv's). These 2 are arguably not even in the best 5 cruiserweights that the WWE have, yet when given a fair amount of time (9 minutes) & a half-decent feud, they come up with a good match. Easy to see how some people wouldn't have liked this bout, but I thought the mixture of styles worked well. Nunzio has the small intangibles that could be of value to SmackDown (at least in the short-term). Furthermore, the interaction of Buh-Buh, D-Von & Johnny Stamboli at ringside, added to the heat of the bout. Match Rating...7

BILLY KIDMAN defeated PAUL LONDON: Another very good match, which was sufficiently different to the cruiserweight bout before it, to make the 2 matches complimentary to each other. Started off with good intensity & London dominating in the prototypical exciting cruiserweight fashion. Then, as Kidman slowly took over, the psychology was top-notch. I really liked the way Kidman didn't immediately go ultra-heel, but worked to it slowly. All the while, the intensity kept up, and the action was entertaining. To top it all off, the ending sequence was exceptionally booked; Kidman blocked London's version of the Shooting Star Press, hits his own for the pin, and then semi snaps after the match to hit it again, as London lay bleeding on a stretcher. Match of the night. Match Rating...8

RENE DUPREE & KENZO SUZUKI defeated REY MYSTERIO & ROB VAN DAM to Retain the WWE Tag-Team Championships: Kenzo may not be the greatest wrestler around, but I am starting to chuckle at his comedic efforts. His rendition of ""Born In The U.S.A"" here, was no exception. This was the 3rd good match in a row!!! As expected, Rey & RVD kept the pace of this bout up, and for the most part, the tag champs kept up well (although Kenzo predictably looked lost on occasions). Dupree kept up his rollercoaster ride over the past few months, with a tremendous performance here. Good mix of everything (without anything special), it was entertaining, and was kept at a good length (9 minutes). Match Rating...7

THE BIG SHOW defeated KURT ANGLE: At the 4 minute mark of this match, Angle got himself intentionally counted out, but Teddy Long predictably came out & restarted the match. While it slowed the momentum of the bout a little, it definitely didn't ruin it, as it was all part of telling what was a decent story. TBS dominated the first half of the match in usual 'Giant' fashion. That was until Angle predictably got the big fella off his feet & worked on the ankle & knee. It got quite competitive at this point (despite a ref bump), but then Angle went for the tranquilizer gun. Cue TBS getting mad & a chokeslam off the top rope later, this match was over. Hard to rate due to it's pace. Definitely watchable & you could see what they were attempting. But too plodding & predictable. Match Rating...6

JOHN CENA defeated BOOKER T to Win the United States Title: Not what the series needed to cap it all off!!! To be honest, this match pretty much summed up the 'best of 5' series. Decent intensity to start off with, but then the next 3 or 4 minutes was average. The bout then started to build well, if a little too methodically. Then an F-U & Cena is our new U.S champ. Not bad, but disappointing & very anti-climactic. What was the point of a 'best of 5' series, if it was going to end in an average 10 minute match!?!?!? This should have been a 20 minute show-stealer. Match Rating...6

RICO, CHARLIE HAAS & MISS JACKIE defeated THE DUDLEY BOYZ & DAWN MARIE: .Pretty much a filler match with a strong emphasis on entertainment & humor. However, to that effect, the bout did it's job more than satisfactorily. The ladies did the little they had to, while The Dudley Boyz played the heels to Rico's usual shenanigans. Haas looked a little lost at times, until he was asked to wrestle later on in the match. That's when he kickstarted what was actually a really good ending sequence that finished with Rico landing a moonsault for the pin. A little hard to rate, but better than your usual filler. Match Rating...6

JOHN BRADSHAW LAYFIELD defeated THE UNDERTAKER in a Last Ride Match to Retain the WWE Championship: The first 6 or 7 minutes of this 21 minute match was pretty much 'more of the same' after their SummerSlam bout. In fact, it was a fair bit worse, to be honest. But then I have to once more give credit where credit is due, as these 2 gave their all in a streetfight type of match. Huge chairshots, table spots & a tombstone on the steel steps may have been things we've seen before, but they were performed very well here. Unfortunately, the (rumored) ending was poor, with Heidenreich interfering on behalf of JBL. It did leave a sour taste in the mouth, however it's hard to downgrade the actual match too much because of it. Match Rating...7

PPV RATING (53/80) = 66

Looking at the key, I have basically given 'No Mercy' a 'B' grade & said that it was a 'good event that was worth the money'. I think I very much agree with that comment & grade. In all honestly, I was quietly confident that this would be a good event & could not understand why so many people were not interested in it. It received a good rating despite 3 matches (Eddie vs Luther, Booker vs Cena & TBS vs Angle) being slightly disappointing. But there was always going to be enough meat on this bone to make it worthwhile. There was some questionable booking decisions, but all in all, the match quality was above average. If the WWE can fix the SmackDown main event scene & make it truly exciting, then they're not as far away as some people would have you think. A job well done.",1114732800,,7110,4.585826771653544
2068708,4,B00028G6R6,"The opening video focused on the night's three main events between Cena and Booker T, The Undertaker and JBL and Kurt Angle and The Big Show. The set was comprised of three large video displays and a small entrance way flanked by smaller video screens.

Eddie Guerrero versus Luther Reigns with Mark Jindrack
There was a time when Jindrack was going to be the fifth member of Evolution. The crowd chanted Eddie from the start as Michael Cole talks about how Luther has been shot and stabbed. Eddie begun the match in control over the much, much larger Luther Reigns, using his speed to hit quickly and counter well. Luther ended the speed of Eddie by grabbed him and pressing him high above his head and slamming him down. He took control from there on in, grabbing a bear hug before having to break it when Eddie stuck his thumbs in the bigger man's eyes. Cole said that Reigns has had his throat slit from ear to ear in his life. I say: Good for him! Luther started to work the lower back of Eddie, suplexing him down and bending him over his knee following a back breaker. After every move, Jindrack would call from ringside to a pin attempt and Luther complied. Eddie was forced to kick out of numerous near-falls. Luther hit his modified suplex slam, but Eddie kicked out. Luther was frustrated, and set up his swinging neck breaker. Eddie used high knees to counter, and then kicked off the ropes to flip over Luther's head and slam him down. Eddie took control, and began to show boat with some silly looking repeated elbows. He was two into his three amigos snap suplexes when Luther threw him face forward into the mat. Eddie rolled out of the ring to recover, and noticed a security guard keeping the crowd back. He stole the security guard's collapsible baton and hid it in his boot. Eddie brought a chair into the ring and he and Luther fought over it. When Luther pulled it away, he nearly hit Mark who was on the apron. Eddie drop kicked Luther, chair and all, into Jindrack. Eddie missed a frog splashed, but while the referee was checking on Jindrack Eddie pulled the baton from his boot and knocked Luther over the head with it. Eddie hit the frog splash and got the victory.

A replay of the cat fight between Dawn Marie and Jackie was shown. Dawn was interviewed backstage by Josh Mathews. Dawn said that when Charlie Haas needed something, he came to her not Jackie. Dawn said she would tell Jackie the truth of their relationship face to face. Dawn went to Jackie's dressing room and found her shirtless. Jackie covered her (...) with her hands while Dawn extolled that she knew that Jackie was the one who proposed, because Charlie told her the night before.

Cruiserweight Championship Match: Spike ""The Boss"" Dudley with the Dudley Boyz versus Nunzio with John Stambolli.
Words cannot describe how small Spike looks. I would say I could take him, but history has shown I could not hurt the man. Nunzio was able to outwrestle Spike from the start, countering and tossing the champ about and out the ring before hitting him with a pescado. Nunzio went to the top rope (Which Tazz rightly said was out of character for the Italian shooter) while Bubba Ray distracted the referee, allowing Devon to push Nunzio off. Spike took control, constantly reapplying a full nelson between attacks, but could not get a pin and was still being countered by the mat technician Nunzio. This greatly frustrated the Dudleyz outside the ring. Spike would begin feeding Nunzio to the Dudleyz outside the ring whenever possible. Still Nunzio fought back. He Irish whipped the champion to the corner, where Spike tried to jump to the top rope. Nunzio was right upon him, wrapping his arm under Spike's crotch and slamming him down to the canvas. Nunzio went on offense with suplexes and flips, but the Dudleyz became involved. Nunzio and Johnny tried to fight off them, but it was three on two. Nunzio was pulled crotch first into the ring post and Spike got a cheap cover over the challenger.

A video showing the Undertaker winning his first WWE Championship from Hulk Hogan is shown. A video detailing the disintegration of the tag team of Paul London and Billy Kidman and the leading to their match is shown.

Billy Kidman versus Paul London
London ran right down to the ring, and immediately took the fight to Kidman with his spectacular offense. He tossed Kidman outside the ring, and used a running springboard moonsault from the second rope over the top rope to the outside onto Kidman. Kidman took control once back in the ring, racking the eyes of London and kicking him in the face. Kidman's offense was ground based, but vicious. It was comprised of stiff kick after stiff kick to the gut of London, and then following them up with placing his knee in London's back and pulling his arms in the wrong way. When London tried to run at Kidman, Kidman caught him up in a fireman's carry and dropped his opponent into a gut buster. Billy was working over the ribs of London, tossing him up into the air and letting him fall front first to the mat. Kidman seemed to be showing off the suffering his was inflicting and the announcers openly wondered if Kidman thought this is the blood thirsty fans wanted. London began to fight back with spin kicks and an enziguri. Paul attempted a power bomb... but you can't power bomb Kidman. Billy and Paul started to trade flying kicks and counters, until Kidman had London down on the mat after a dropkick. Billy went to the outside for the Shooting Star, but decided against it and moved to leave. At the count of nine Kidman returned to the ring and resumed the action with London. Paul hit a super kick to the chest of Kidman and went to the top. Instead of the four-fifty splash, however, London preformed an absolutely perfect shooting star press. It was much better than the one Kidman does mind you. Unfortunately for London, Kidman got his knees up into the face of Paul London. Billy decided to give the fans what they wanted, and hit a shooting star of his own, no where near was well done as Paul's and was mostly knees to the gut of Paul and got the pin fall. After the match, Paul was bleeding from the mouth and the paramedics were strapping him to a backboard. Billy Kidman took the microphone and asked the fans if that was what they wanted to see and if they were happy they made him do that. Billy climbed to the top rope and gave Paul another shooting star (Equally bad, please stop using that move) while he was strapped to the board.

Another video was shown, this one of the Undertaker winning the title from Psycho Side at Wrestlemania XIII. JBL was interviewed backstage. He said that this Pay-Per-View had been biased for the Undertaker. He wondered if the videos were fair and balanced, or if this was more Dan Rather liberal media lying. He was too afraid to guarantee a victory though. Instead he said his loss would be over his dead body.

WWE Tag Championship Match: Kenzo Suzuki and Rene Dupree versus Rob Van Dam and Rey Mysterio Jr.
Before the match, Rene said something in French and Kenzo did his impression of New Jersey's Bruce Springsteen. RVD and Rene started the match off with a series of missed maneuvers on the canvas, with each man nimbly dodging from the other. Rey and Kenzo were tagged in, with Rey dancing around Kenzo and striking inward suddenly. He and RVD hit tandem topes onto the heel team. RVD had been tagged in and gone to the top rope, but Rene tossed him off (Flying over the head of Kenzo's Geisha) and to the outside. Kenzo went on offense on RVD, using his awful offense on Rob and preventing the tag to Rey Rey. When Rey got the tag he hit a flying head butt from the top and a tornado DDT onto Kenzo. He knocked Rene off the apron and then launched himself back into the ring, onto Kenzo in a seat senton. Rey set up a 619 but Dupree ran in to interfere, bringing Rob Van Dam back in to double team first Dupree and then Kenzo. Rey hit the 619 on Kenzo, and set up the West Coast Pop but Rene pulled him from the ropes. Kenzo pinned Mysterio, held on the ropes and got the very cheap victory to retain the title belts.

An advertisement for the Interactive Taboo Tuesday was shown. A video detailing the feud between Kurt Angle and The Big Show was shown.

Kurt Angle versus the Big Show
The stipulation for the match was that anyone who interfered would be fired. The Big Show looked bigger (Read: Fatter) than ever, and had an ugly sun burn on his back. Slow and methodical action to start, with the Big Show throwing Angle across the anytime he got close. Angle was hiding in the corner, but Big Show threw him into the corner and then guerrilla press slammed him down. Angle had enough, and Kurt began to walk away from the match. Angle ran back to the ring and than counted along with the referee, waiting for the loss. Teddy Long came to ringside and declared that if Kurt ran away he would never wrestle on Smackdown again. Of course Kurt returned to the ring, actually tripping over the steel steps in the process. The beating resumed, with the Big Show actually standing on Angle at one point. Kurt tried to grab a steel chair, but the Big Show punched it into Angle's face. Kurt tried to jump onto the Big Show from the second rope, but was caught and slammed down. The Big Show called for the choke slam - but Kurt actually countered it into the Ankle lock! The Big Show was diagonally away from the ropes, and was in the hold over a minute before he finally kicked out. The official was bumped, and evil Kurt Angle went after the downed Giant. He beat the injured ankle with a steel chair and wrenched the leg around in a variety of holds. He even hung upside from the apron to further aggravate the leg of the Big Show before the referee awoke. Still Angle could not get the victory. Frustrated, he went beneath the ring and grabbed the tranquilizer gun. The Big Show popped up, seemingly enraged. He grabbed the gun and broke it over his knee.",1114128000,,9968,4.499723909442297

2068710,2,B00028G6R6,"I am writing this review as a warning, that in terms of the WWE, newer isn't better and the recent No Mercy proves my point. This PPV demoted former WWE Champion Eddie Guerrero to the opening match. We saw John Cena and Booker T class for the 5th time, therefore the whole novelty of this encounter had worn off.

 We saw two awful tag team encounters providing Mysterio & RVD against Dupree & Suzuki, and the Dudley Boys and Dawn Marie taking on Rico, Charlie Haas and Miss Jackie. How on earth could the Dudley Boys lose to these guys?

Therefore, the only highlights of this pay per view in my opinion were Big Show vs Kurt Angle and Billy Kidman vs Paul London. As for the main event, it has been seen already so change the channel.",1111449600,,736,4.318840579710145
2068711,2,B00028G6R6,"No Mercy said it's name.  It had No Mercy on its fans.  I decided not order this on PPV and I was glad but i did rent it.  Here are the matches in the order I think they should be.

Intergender Tag Match

This is what Dawn Marie gets for trying to break up a loving couple.

Miss Jackie, who teamed up with fiancee Charlie Haas and good friend Rico, defeated the meddling Dawn Marie along with the Dudleys in a rare intergender tag team match at No Mercy Sunday.

Dawn Marie taunted Miss Jackie from the outset, even wearing a ""Charlie Loves Dawn"" T-Shirt to the ring.

Miss Jackie would eventually strip Dawn of her top, and Haas and Rico both connected with high-flying moves from the top rope to help record the victory.

The match ended with Jackie and Dawn wrestling outside the ring -- a common sight these days. It also featured an in-ring kiss. But it wasn't Miss Jackie and Charlie smooching. Instead, it was Rico who planted a wet one on an unsuspecting and soon disgusted Bubba Ray.

Cruiserweight Championship

Maybe the worst thing Nunzio did is get Spike Dudley's attention.

Beating Spike once is hard enough. Beating him twice, especially with the Cruiserweight Championship on the line, might be impossible.

Just days after Nunzio upset Spike in a non-title match on SmackDown!, Boss Dudley made sure it didn't happen again with a hard-fought victory to retain his WWE Cruiserweight Championship at No Mercy.

Early in the match, Nunzio more than held his own against the champion, keeping Spike off balance with his aggressive style.

But with Spike's overprotective buddies looking on, the odds were too much to overcome as Bubba Ray used the ring post to deliver a nasty low blow from the outside and Spike quickly capitalized with the cover.

Paul London vs. Billy Kidman

It looks like Billy Kidman is over his fears.

In a match where former tag-team partner Paul London was out for blood, it was London who left bleeding Sunday night at No Mercy.

Kidman rallied late in the match and delivered a pair of Shooting Star Presses, the second came after London was already bleeding from the mouth, strapped to a portable stretcher and receiving medical attention. London actually set himself up when he went for his own version of the Shooting Star Press. And as pretty as it looked going up, coming down he landed on Kidman's knees.

Kidman also got on the microphone and asked the fans if they were happy that he injured yet another Superstar with his trademark high-flying move.

WWE Tag Team Championship

Kenzo Suzuki and Rene Dupree have almost nothing in common.

Suzuki is from Japan and harbors an unabashed love of America. Dupree hails from France and makes his disdain for the United States quite clear.

But what they do share is what counts the most: the WWE Tag Team Championship. Suzuki and Dupree prevailed yet again at No Mercy, defeating the high-flying duo of Rey Mysterio and Rob Van Dam.

Mysterio and Van Dam appeared to be in control late in the match as Mysterio connected with the 619, but when he went to the top rope to land the West Coast Pop, Dupree tripped him up, crashing Mysterio right into the easy cover for Suzuki, who used the ropes for good measure.

Luther Reigns vs. Eddie Guerrero

He's a liar. He's a cheater. Call Eddie Guerrero what you want, but at No Mercy, Latino Heat was a big winner.

Guerrero defeated Luther Reigns using the lethal combination of a steel chair, a police baton and his patented frog splash.

Reigns, who has been interfering in Guerrero matches for nearly a month now, used his brute strength to inflict plenty of damage early in the match, including a massive power slam that forced Guerrero to collect his thoughts outside the ring.

And while he was there, Latino Heat stole a police baton right from the belt of a nearby New Jersey officer. Remember, he's also a stealer. Guerrero stuffed the weapon in his boot, and when the referee turned his back to return a chair to ringside, Guerrero drilled Reigns in the head with the baton.

One frog splash later, Guerrero had his revenge in true Latin Cheat fashion.

Kurt Angle vs. Big Show

Big Show may have lost his hair, but he restored his self-respect at No Mercy.

Show was clearly bald and desperate for revenge after Kurt Angle took him down with a tranquilizer dart two weeks ago, and then with the help of Luther Reigns and Mark Jindrak, proceeded to shave the 7-foot, 470-pounder's head.

But Reigns and Jindrak were barred from ringside for the No Mercy clash. Show dominated Angle so completely in the early going, the Olympic Champ actually let himself get counted out and promptly headed for the exit. But SmackDown! General Manager Theodore Long intervened, announcing a restart and demanding a winner.

Angle made a nice comeback, applying the ankle lock and even connecting with an Angle Slam, but Show, clearly favoring a now damaged left leg, persevered. Angle then watched in horror as Show grabbed Angle's trusty tranquilizer and broke it in half.

With Angle running out of options, Show propped Angle on the top rope and chokeslammed him through the air and to the canvas.

It might be a while before his hair grows back, but for one night at least, Big Show gained his revenge.

U.S. CHAMPIONSHIP

John Cena took the fifth.

In the final and deciding match of the best-of-five series with Booker T for the United States Championship, Cena survived yet another back-and-forth battle to regain the championship former SmackDown! General Manager Kurt Angle stripped him of this summer.

Cena and Booker T traded major blows throughout the match, even throwing each other into the steel steps.

But after Booker T contemplated bringing a chair into the ring, Cena caught him with the FU, recording the three-count and capturing the coveted United States Championship.

WWE Championship

Despite blood covering his face, JBL retained the WWE Championship in bizarre and downright surreal fashion Sunday night at No Mercy. And of all people, it was Heidenreich, the unstable giant under the devious command of Paul Heyman, who turned the match in JBL's favor.

Undertaker seemed destined to win the championship as the gruesome match wore on. In fact, he tombstoned JBL on the steel steps and chokeslammed him through the Spanish announce table. The Phenom then carried JBL to the hearse parked outside the ring. But when Taker opened the backdoor, Heidenreich jumped out and attempted to subdue Taker with a cloth soaked in Chloroform.

Undertaker, a tad groggy, would escape, but JBL hit the Clothesline From Hell onto the ramp and then stuffed Taker into the hearse for good.

Backstage, Paul Heyman emerged from the driver's seat and then commanded Heidenreich to crash a pick-up truck full speed into the hearse. The status of Taker was unknown when the show went off the air. However, the status of Heidenreich is clearer than ever -- he's a crazed and tormented human being.

No Mercy was bad.  If you like my order of the card better then the WWE's say it was a helpful review if you think the WWE's card was better hit not helpful.",1111017600,,7099,4.755102040816326

Spike Dudley vs. Nunzio

Spike Dudley wins. WWE's cruiserweight division is a joke, anyway. Spike wins.

Paul London vs. Billy Kidman

This was a good match, but a little short. It had some good spots, but nothing ""OH MY GOD!"" material. Kidman then SSPs Paul London as London chews a blood capsule. Kidman wins.

Kenzo Suzuki & Ren Dupre vs. Rey Mysterio Jr. & Rob Van Dam

This was also a good match, surprisingly. The action at the beginning was what surprised me, actually. Suzuki & Dupre win when Suzuki uses the ropes.

Big Show comes out lookin' like King Kong Bundy. Har har. Angle tries to count himself out, but Teddy Long forces Angle back in the match. Big Show wins.

Booker T vs. John Cena

Booker T shoulda won. Cena sucks. I loved it when Carlito...Caribbean...Cool won the title from Cena in one of SmackDown!'s all-time greatest moments the SmackDown! after this show. Cena won this match, which sucked like all of Cena's recent matches. Did I mention Cena sucks?

Nobody cares/10. Not even that Rico/Bubba kiss saved this. Haas, Rico, & Jackie win.

  This was a very slow paced match until Haas got in the match he was flying all over the place.  Jackie & Dawn went at it and Haas, Rico & Jackie pick up the win. 4/10

Big Show v. Kurt Angle
  This was not a very good match and it had too much build up.  When you give a match too much build up it won't be good.  Show just dominates Kurt to get the win. 5/10

JBL v. Undertaker  WWE Title  Last Ride Match
  This was an incredible match and one of Taker's best but Heidenreich ruined it and that was very shocking to me.  JBL retained thanks to Heidenreich and then Heidenreich smashes the Underaker with a truck when he is in the limo. 10/10

This PPV scored a 61.  It was great but still don't pick it up unless for JBL v. Taker.",1101340800,3,2041,4.063291139240507

  This was the first bad match of the night.  Nunzio needed to win this match because he hasn't won a title yet.  Spike retains.**

Booker T v. John Cena  U.S. Title

  Great match.  I loved it.  Eddie steals a nightstick from a ringside officer and hits Luther with it.  Eddie hits Froggie and wins.

Billy Kidman v. Paul London

  ZZZZZZZZZZZZ.........oh wait did something happen.  This match was stupid.  I only liked when Kidman did the Star Press to London when he was on the strechter.  Kidman wins.

Kenzo Suzuki & Rene Dupree v. RVD & Rey Mysterio  Tag Titles

  I love this rivalry but this match was dumb.  Kenzo absolutely stinks.  Torrie should just him hit for stalking her.  RVD & Mysterio are my guys.  Kenzo & Dupree win.

Spike Dudley v. Nunzio  Cruiserweight Title

  For a cruiserweight match it is pretty good.  I cant figure it out is Nunzio a face or heel.  It would have been cool if Chuck Paulmbo came back in this match.  Spike wins.

Booker T v. John Cena  U.S. Title

  I really thought this match was okay nothing great.  It served no purpose because Cena loses the title to Carlito Carribbean Cool?????????in 4 days.

  I found this entertaining because of the cat fight and all the good moves but besides that it stunk.

2068733,4,B00028G6R6,"No Mercy 2004 was the first time in about four months where just the Smackdown guys put on their show for us. And unlike the disaster known as the Great American Bash, I must say, this is a lot better than it looks.

Seeing as how some good performers were back in the ring; Kurt and Show, and some new guys were put in; Kidman and London, they balanced this ppv out throughout the entire show. I say this is definately worth your time in looking at it.

Eddie Guerrero vs. Luther Reigns: Now this is pretty good for an opener, but since I feel like Eddie should be in title matches I really felt like it wasn't the best it could have been. Eddie wins after stealing a guards nightstick and whacking it over Luther's head. A good match with some funny moments that got the crowd in a good mood. 7.5/10

Billy Kidman vs. Paul London: Wow, definately a great match between these two which is a surprise. Lots of high moves and fast paced action. Kidman wins and becomes a bad guy after doing another Shooting star press when London was on a stretcher. Good match, 8.5/10

RVD and Mysterio vs. Suzuki and Renee Dupree: Bad match, and its because Suzuki was in it. No disrespect to the other guys who wrestle, but this guy is horrible. RVd and Mysterio make a unique team though so that helped this, but still not that good. 7/10

Spike Dudley vs, Nunzio: Nunzio has been in here since December 2002, and has not won a single title since. Well he can now add another month to that list. I thought he would win but the Dudleyz help ""The Boss"" to win. Okay match. 7.5/10

Booker T vs. John Cena: Very good, but since Cena lost to Carlito  Cool 4 days later, it now seems like a waste of time. But anyway this is alwright. Booker T and Cena have some chemistry though its not the best there is. Cena wins to become a two time US champ. 8/10

Dudlyez and Dawn Marie vs. Charlie Hass, Rico, and Miss Jackie: Somebody kill this love triangle storyline please! Good match with the usual catfight but nothing special. Just a match to entertain the crowd and take up time, but still enjoyable. 7.5/10

Kurt Angle vs. Big Show: First time in a few months these two have gone one on one together. Big Show is bald, but in my opinion its a good look for him, as long as he keeps the beard. A good match and a great chokeslam at the very end. A very good match. 8.5/10

Undertaker vs. JbL: Possibly the best title match JBL has been in so far. Not that I am a fan of his. Undertaker completely destroyed JBL in the whole match. With the exception of a great chairshot that JBL swung at the Undertaker's head. But Undertaker would fight back and chokeslam JBL though an announce table while he was on another announce table. Than Heidenreich comes in and ruins it.

What happened next was the annual big car crash, as Heidenriech drove a car headfirst into the hearse. While the undertaker was supposedly in it. A great moment, but a little too dramatic to make it seem the most believable.

I would definately reccomend this to anyone who wants to see a good Smackdown ppv, which is rare nowadays.",1099094400,3,3080,4.337391304347826
2068734,4,B00028G6R6,"Lemme just emphasize how much better this PPV was than Unforgiven! Unforgiven was what it's name says, ""Unforgiving""!!! Any ways on to the matches:

1) Eddie Guererro vs. Luther Reigns: I wonder why the 2 most recent Champions are now shot down to opening PPVs (Benoit and Guererro) but whatever! This match sucked! Eddie and Luther have horrible chemistry in the ring. Would have been better if Jindrak interferred a little bit more. Eddie cheats to win! 2/10

2) Spike Dudley (c) vs. Nunzio for the Cruiserweight Championship: Solid match with a decent amount of interferance by the Dudley! Nunzio gave Spike a good run but was cheated in the end. Way to go Spike! I guess the FBI have gone face officially. 6/10

3) Billy Kidman vs. Paul London: AWESOME! I thought it would be the match of the card, but unfortunately fell short of the six man/woman tag. Had a lot of action! These 2 have so much potential and I hope to see their pushes continue! Awesome Shooting Star Presses delivered by both men! Kidman wins and goes heel! Great stuff! 8.5/10

4) Rey Mysterio & RVD vs. Kenzo Suzuki & Renee Dupree (c) for the WWE Tag Team Championship: I didn't really pay attention during this match cuz I hate Rey Mysterio! They need to stop giving him title matches for any title! Too bad they are doing this to such an awesome talent (RVD). Kenzo and Renee retain!

5/10

5) Kurt Angle vs. The Big Show: As I expected...AWESOME! Kurt is an awesome heel! This is a great feud and these guys have great in ring chemistry eventhough Show is known best for squashing people. Show wins with a wicked chokeslam off the turnbuckle! 7/10

6) Booker T (c) vs. John Cena Match #5 in the Best of 5 Series for the Undisputed United States Championship: Nothing next to Booker T and Benoit's best of 7, but good stuff. This was an average match, with solid performances by both superstars. I was surprised at the ending though, I was sure Booker would win cuz Cena is leaving for a few months. Cena ends up pulling it off with the FU! But what happened 2 days later on Smackdown made this series a total waste...Cena looses the title to Carlito Carribean Cool!!! WHAT!!! Bad way for Cena to go out and one hell of a debut by Cool. 6.5/10

7) Charlie Haas, Rico, & Miss Jackie vs. The Dudley & Dawn Marie: Match of the card by far! I thought this would suck but I was glued to the TV for this one! There was action, comedy, and GIRL FIGHTS! What more could you ask for? Plus Jackie and Dawn Marie are so so hot!!! the only reason why this doesn't get a perfect 10 is because they created a dud storyline with Dawn Marie saying she has been having an affair with Charlie when he is engaged to Jackie, lame! C, R, and J win! 9.5/10

8) Undertaker vs. JBL (c) in a Last Ride Match for the WWE Championship: Better than I expected. I thought Taker was gonna win through politics, but JBL still retained! JBL is the best Champion I have seen in a long long while! Match started out slow (cuz Taker was dominating ofcourse) but then JBL turned the tides on him, and it was a great match. The ending was great, Heidenreich's best performance to date! 8/10

Overall, this was a great PPV. Not as good as Bad Blood though I still say that was the best single brand PPV of the year! Let's see if JBL can hold the tile all the way til Wrestlemania, or atleast No Way Out!",1097107200,3,3342,4.367149758454106
2068735,4,B00028G6R6,"No mercy was preety good with a great opening and mid card but the two main events JBL vs. Taker and Kurt vs. Show both were pretty average and should have been way better. London vs. Kidman was great, as was Eddie vs. Luther Reigns, Luther can get it done in the ring. There were also strong performances from RVD/Mysterio and Dupree(Not Suzuki no talent) and the cruiserweights. But here is who I think should be main eventers on Raw and Smackdown and who should be pushed.

Raw main eventers-Triple H, Benoit, Jericho,HBK,Kane,Orton and Edge

Raw wrestlers who should be pushed-Rhyno,Benjamin,Christian,A Train(when he returns), Batista, and Matt Hardy

SD main eventers-Kurt Angle,Undertaker,Eddie Guerrero,John Cena,Booker T, RVD and even Rey Mysterio

Sd wrestlers who should be pushed-Paul London,RVD,Charlie Haas,Renee Dupree and Billy Kidman

WWE should give this a thought but they won.t because their stupid!!!!",1097107200,2,922,5.375
2068736,4,B00028G6R6,"Solid effort by the Smackdown brand.  There is nothing spectacular in the match, but most of the matches are good.

1. Eddie Guerrero vs. Luther Reigns

Good opener.  Mark Jindrak came to ringside with Reigns.  Actually, a good performance by Luther who is proving he has what it takes to make it big.  Of course, a great performance by Latino Heat.  Kind of a stupid, but ingenious ending.  (7.5/10)

2. Spike Dudley vs. Nunzio (Cruiserweight Title)

The Dudleys came to ringside with Spike and Johhny Stambolie was with Nunzio.  People didn't seem to like this match, but I enjoyed it.  It was not a very fast paced match, but it was still good.  Strong finish with some near falls.  (8/10)

3. Billy Kidman vs. Paul London

Paul London is going to be a great talent.  Very good match.  Probably the match of the night.  Plenty of high spots.  Watch London do the Shooting Star Press.  He gets so hight.  Great post match action.  (8.5/10)

4. Kenzo Suzuki & Rene Dupree vs. RVD & Rey Mysterio (WWE Tag Titles)

Another good match.  Very innovative and exciting offense between Mysterio and RVD.  Dupree had one of his better performances.  I hope they finally do a Mysterio/Kidman fued.  (8/10)

5. Kurt Angle vs. Big Show

Probably, the second worst match of the night.  (And, this is coming from a die hard Angle fan).  Angle tried his best to carry Show, but just couldn't do it.  There just wasn't much going on in this match, except for the top rop Chokeslam by Show on Angle.  Very disappointing.  (7/10)

6. Booker T vs. John Cena (U.S. Championship/Best of 5, Match #5)

The second worst match of this series, only behind the Summerslam match.  You figure they would have saved the best for last.  Cena is a great character, but he definately need to hone his wrestling skills.  Booker T is starting to become washed up.  Not a good match.  (7/10)

7. Dudley Boys & Dawn Marie vs. Charlies Haas, Rico, & Jackie (Intergender Tag Match)

It is too bad Haas is not utilized the way he should be.  He is a great talent.  The Dudley's are getting washed up.  (6/10)

8. Undertaker vs. JBL (WWE Title/Last Ride Match)

Slow match, but good.  Great chair shot by JBL on Taker.  JBL takes some serious bumps in the match.  (Will somebody please give him some credit).  Taker Tombstones JBL on the steps and Taker Chokeslams JBL from one announce table to the next.  Good spot.  Kind of surprising finish.  Good post match action.  (8/10)

I recommed to pick up this DVD because most of the matches are pretty good.

2068737,3,B00028G6R6,"No Mercy, held on October 3rd 2004, and hosted by SMACKDOWN, was a reasonable effort with several decent matches, one that dragged, one was abysmal, and one was excellent

Eddie Gueerero vs Luther Reins: Eddie in the opening match is a testement to how stupid Vince Mcmahon is...Luther botched most of his offense in this match, and Eddie took several minutes to get himself together and move the match towards it's conclusion, pretty decent for what it was **

Cruserweight Championship: Spike Dudley vs Nunzio: Not much regarding this one, way too short to mean anything as usual, Spike defeats Nunzio with the help of The Dudley Boyz *

Paul London vs Billy Kidman: Match of the night as far as I'm concerned, London and Kidman put on an excellent high-flying match, Kidman worked a ground based stlye to irritate the crowd who were desperate to see the Shooting Star Press, Kidman indeed, gives them what they want, but it comes at a price, as he ""hits"" London's head and busts him open before pinning him. (he really hits his knees if you watch carefully), a short match, but reasonable given London abd Kidman's efforts in the time they were allowed  ****1/2

Kurt Angle vs The Big Show: Clearly anyone thinking this match was above *** is deluisional, as Big Show eventually no-sold Kurt's offense on his leg and the match didn't look belevible at all, Kurt looked REALLY ackward in this match as he tried to make himself look like a genuine threat to a wrestler twice his size, Big Show choke-slams Angle off the top rope to defeat him. **

WWE Tag Team Championships: Rob Van Damn and Rey Mysterio vs Rene Dupre and Kenzo Suzuki: Perfect match for all of the RVD/Mysterio marks out there, but  Kenzo Suzuke blows every move he makes, and botches moves he's given by his opponents, including a hurricarana that you have to SEE to beleive, Rene Dupre, meanwhile, does fine and makes up for Kenzo's screw-ups, Kenzo pins Mysterio with his hand gripping the ropes **1/2

John Cena vs Booker T: BLECH, what the hell is wrong with most John Cena fans? Yeah, the guy is immensly popular, but every match he has sucks, Booker T is also pretty broken down and the two deliver a ten-minute drag fest that fails to live up to the previous matches in the Best of Five (which isn't saying much considering they sucked as well) the match is limited of psychology and pacing, Cena ends the match with a petty F-U and takes back the United States Championship. *

Six-Person Intergender Tag Team Match: Charlie Hass, Rico, and Miss Jackie vs Dawn Marie, and The Dudley Boyz, pretty good comedy match, Hass carried this baby on his back, and of course, Miss Jackie and Dawn Marie provided the real reason fans will watch this match, a lengthy cat-fight between the two was perfect for the Puppy-adoring audience. **1/5

Last Ride Match For The WWE Championship (the challenger or champion must throw his opponent into a herse to win the match) J.B.L vs The Undertaker:

In a match far removed from J.B.L's decent work at Summerslam, The Undertaker dominated this slow-paced brawl for the WWE championship, slow build-ups, slow brawling, and a few major spots (tombstone on J.B.L on the steel steps and a chokeslam to J.B.L through the announce table)are what you can expect to see before Hidenreich shows up to screw Undertaker, throwing him into the herse (which is required for the match to finish) and smashes the herse with another veichle  in a stunt ripped straght from the days of the N.W.O DUD

An average B-Level PPV, No Mercy was a card with only one abysmal match, and whilst the remainder certaingly had their share of faults, most of the opponents made enough of an effort to send the crowd away happy.

If you're an entertainment fan...you'll probably appreciate this for the Six-person Intergender tag match, Miss Jackie ""revealing"" apperances backstage and in the cat-fight, the tag team match with the RVD/Mysterio spot-fests, and of course, if you're an Undertaker mark, the main event for the two high spots.",1096848000,,4019,4.747489239598278

8023947,2,B00028G6R6,"WWE seems to go through a spat of dark days every ten years or so where the quality of their shows dip even when they've got a superior roster and resources. Most of 2004 falls under that umbrella as almost every event after WrestleMania 20 either disappointed of failed to live up to expectations. ""No Mercy"" came around in the middle of that downturn, and, while not the basin, there's nothing to write home about on this show.

It's not that there's anything truly wretched on the show; instead, every match is very mediocre, like everyone had an off night. The best matches weren't anywhere near match of the year contenders and most of the matches would be shoulder-shrugged if we got them for free on Smackdown. Even the ""Great American Bash"", commonly called the worst event of 2004, had two outstanding, memorable matches. Here, there really isn't anything.

There are some interesting moments: Eddie Guerrero wins his match in a unique fashion, Billy Kidman hits his signature move while Paul London is strapped to a stretcher, and The Undertaker is assaulted by a crazed Heidenreich during his match with JBL.

Match wise, my favorite probably was the main event Last Ride Match that at least was a diverting big man brawl, slightly edging out JBL and Taker's match at SummerSlam. The crowd at least reacted to this match, and it got so over the top by end it was hard not to crack a smile.

This event epitomizes the word ""nondescript"" since nothing made an impression; stars like Kurt Angle, Eddie Guerrero, The Big Show, Rey Mysterio and RVD couldn't drag anything more than a passable match out of their opponents and it seemed too many members of the roster were out of their depth.

8023949,3,B00028G6R6,"Luther Reigns VS Eddie Guerrero: I don't understand the commentary of this match, Michael Cole talked about someone getting sliced ear to ear with a knife. I guess I wasn't paying to much attention. Reigns looked impressive in this match and worked on the lower back of Eddie thru out the match. Jindrak is on the outside and gets in a few shots as well. Eddie comes back and it makes me miss Eddie even more. I'll admit that I never got Guerrero when he was alive but damn watching him now, he's more fun to watch then half the current WWE roster. Ending saw Eddie steal a baton from a security guard and then place a chair in the ring, Reigns steals it and he dropkicks the chair and it hits Jindrak instead. Guerrero hits a frog splash but missed, then the ref finally takes the chair out of the ring, and Eddie uses a baton on Reign and pretends he is knocked out as well. Eddie then hits a frog splash and covers Reigns and wins a very fun match-up; I really miss Eddie.

Spike Dudley VS Nuzio: Even though this is a cruiserweight action, these are two men I could careless about. The match was decent with Dudley Boys trying to help there brother retain the cruiserweight title. They do indeed help as Spike wins with help from Bubba to end a really crappy match.

Billy Kidman VS Paul London: A nice video package shows before the match and I predict this match will be good and i'm hope i'm not wrong. A slow paced brawl but did have some good moments thru out. Kidman doesnt want to hit a shooting star press and walks away from the ring. London tries to hit his own shooting star press but Kidman gets the knees up and Kidman hits his own vicious shooting star press and wins it. The match was alright but could have been shorter.

JBL does an interview and I don't care what fans think. He was a great heel during his championship reign on Smackdown until he brought in that stupid cabinet.

Rene Dupree (with dog) and Kenzo Suzuki VS RVD and Rey Mysterio: Dupree has tights that says French Tickler, ha ha. Enjoyable match but Suzuki uses the ropes in the end to retain the tag team titles.

Big Show VS Kurt Angle: Show is newly bald as a result of Angle. Angle quickly gets counted out but not so fast! Teddy Long restarts the match. A slow paced brawl with Show dominating and then Angle starts to attack the leg of Show. Angle brings in a tranquilzer gun in the ring (what the hell?) and Show breaks it over his knee. Show wins with a choke slam from the top rope in anther decent match.

John Cena VS Booker T in Best of 5 Series Match: Cena retains the TV title in a good but not great match.

Dudleys and Dawn Marie VS Jackie, Charlie Haas, and Rico: A decent storyline going in but the match sucked. A funny moment when D-Von went for a wassup on Rico but he didn't want too and it cost them. Rico wins with a nice top rope moonsault.

Undertaker VS JBL: JBL's facial expression when he sees the Undertaker is priceless. Taker dominates the first half of the match, JBL finally comes back with steel steps to the face and he dominates the next five minutes or so until Taker uses the gates of hell. A very good match but Heidenreich interferes and costs Taker the match. JBL cuts a great promo after the match as Heidenreich smashes a trick into the hearse that Undertaker is in and the PPV ends.

8023950,4,B00028G6R6,"No Mercy was a good follow up from Summerslam on Smackdown's part. This ppv ended a lot of the feuds that were happening and started some very good ones that carried all the way over to the Royal Rumble.

1. Eddie Guerrero vs. Luther Reigns w/ Mark Jindrake
I enjoyed this opener very much. this is probably reigns best match while in the wwe. Reigns mostly stays in control of the match. It had a classic Eddie ending with ""lyin, cheatin, and stealin"" to his victory. A strong opener. Pretty good match. 4/5

2. Cruiserweight Title
Nunzio vs. Spike
this wasn't your typical high flying, fast paced cruiserweight match. Spike and Nunzio kept the match on the ground and tryed to have a ground based match. The dudley boyz interefered on spikes behalf and helping spike to retain his title. 2.5/5

3. Billy Kidman vs. Paul London
Wow, what a mind blower. This match was just great. Kidman was starting to become a heel during this time and he pulled it off so good in this match. He consistently kept on going back to the ribs of London and adding more punishment to them as the match went on. The after math added more to the match as well. A good cruiserweight battle from London and Kidman here. 4.5/5

4. WWE Tag Team Titles
RVD & Rey Mysterio vs. Renee Dupree & Kenzo Suzuki
Kenzo & Dupree has to be the most untalented tag team champs of all time. RVD and Mysterio saved this match from being a complete waste. Their style meshed in so well together as team. They helped to make Dupree and Kenzo look a little bit decent in this match which made this match alright to watch. Not the best but not the worst of the night. 3.5/5

5. Big Show vs. Kurt Angle
This was another good match to watch. The story went off with Show being ""raped of his dignity"" by having his head shaved by Angle. Angle was for sure selling his fear of the big show. This had to been one Show's best matches since coming to the wwe. Angle did a good job selling his fear and even using a chair at times on show. The chokeslam from the top rope is something to see as well. A good match. 4/5

6. Match 5 for the United States Title
John Cena vs. Booker T
This was the final match of the series. Booker did a good job bringing out the wrestling sense in cena. I believe the best run in cena's career was when he held the US title. Cena and booker had a good competitive and back and forth match. A solid match up. a good match to end the series and this feud. 4.25/5

7. Dudley Boyz & Dawn Marie vs. Charlie Haas, Rico & Miss Jackie
This was just a filler to set up the wwe title match but this turned out to be a good match to watch. Rico added humor and comedic spots to the match. Maire and Jackie had a good cat fight at some points in the match. A match worth a watch here. 3.25/5

8. Last Ride Match for the WWE Title
JBL vs. Undertaker
this match defiantely made up for that little brawl they had at summerslam. As other reviewers pointed out, this match is just brutal and violent as they say it is. jbl takes a viscious beating from the deadman.

this match was a straight up fight. jbl was bringing out some of his old school ""bradshaw"" style to the undertaker. a couple of weapons used in the match. jbl also gets very bloody after being tomebstoned on the steel steps. this match had a good table spot. A brutal, brutal and violent match. the intereference from heidenrich didn't hurt the match either in my opinion. another good match to end this feud as well. 5/5

no mercy is one i recommend in picking up to see sometime if you have some spare cash around. the last ride match is something to see and the undercard is pretty good as well.",1224633600,,3629,4.2387843704775685
