2223290,5,B0007NMJRW,"Great hilarious stand-up comedy featuring Freddy Soto, Pablo Francisco, and Carlos Mencia.  Product arrived new in original sealed packaging.

2223291,1,B0007NMJRW,Wanted a few funny DVD's for a long car trip. It's not funny at all. Possibly a few little giggles but nothing much. Was VERY disappointed. What a waste of money.,1187827200,,162,4.258064516129032
2223292,5,B0007NMJRW,"Get three of the popular Latino comedians together and you get three stand-up routines to enjoy.  This isn't like as they say ""the white"" Three Amigos film (Chevy Chase, Steve Martin, Martin Short), which was a comedy, but this 2001 comedy concert film just borrows the ""Three Amigos"" title in a cute way.

  The first comedian up is Freddy Soto who just recently died, July 10, 2005 of unknown causes.  His routine in this film is 22 minutes.

  You can also see him in Deadly Swarm (2003), Spanglish (2004).

  Did you know Freddy Soto use to be a limousine driver for Richard Pryor?

  Next up is Pablo Francisco.  Pablo makes fun of bell-wearing on scrotum, Backstreet Boys,Ricky Martin, Jackie Chan, Arnold S. and movie trailer announcers.  His routine in this film is 13 minutes long.  You can also see Pablo Francisco in 1996-97 of Mad TV, Latino Laugh Festival: The Show (2004).

  Third time is a charm and they save the best for laugh.  We first saw Carlos Mencia on the January 15, 1994 live broadcast of Comic Relief 6.  He currently has a limited comedy tv series, ""Mind of Mencia"", on the Comedy Central Channel.

  Carlos Mencia was actually born in Honduras.

  Mencia's routine in this film is 31 minutes.

No extras on this DVD, but you have the option of English captions, French, Spanish subtitles or just listen in English.

  Okay, I'll shut up now.",1122508800,19,1371,4.654008438818566
2223293,4,B0007NMJRW,This dvd is a blast. Although raunchy and tasteless sometimes it still makes me chuckle. I cherish this dvd for the mere fact that Freddy Soto was taken too soon at 35 but rest assured he's entertaining GOD.He will always be remembered as the translator on SPANGLISH with Adam Sandler. If you want a laugh buy this disc and keep in mind Freddy Soto's passing. We truly are going to miss this talent at a very young age. GOD REST YOUR SOUL.,1121817600,2,439,4.365853658536586
