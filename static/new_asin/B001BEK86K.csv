Could have been a great movie without the bad language, as with many of his movies, but it's touching, romantic, funny yet dramatic, with an unexpected ending.  I found Bette Midler was a bit too much Bette Midler, but overall the casting was near perfect.  I think Helen Hunt did a good job, and the extras with the DVD are very nice:  Helen takes one through the movie with personal and professional tidbits which are very interesting and fun to hear about.",1436659200,,521,4.630434782608695

3490380,5,B001BEK86K,"THEN SHE FOUND ME [2007] [Blu-ray] A Fine Unpredictable Comedy! Smart, Engaging and Funny! Award-Calibre Acting! Extremely Funny!

This touching, warmly amusing story directed by Helen Hunt, follows schoolteacher April Epner [Helen Hunt] on her very unlikely path toward personal fulfilment. Following here separation from her husband Ben Green [Mathew Broderick] and the death of her adoptive mother, April Epner is contacted by her apparent birth mother Bernice Graves [Bette Midler], a colourful local talk show host who's not exactly the ideal mum. As she tries to become her mother to April that she never was able to be, April Epner finds solace in the arms of the father of one of her students Frank [Colin Firth]. With every aspect of her world turned upside down, April Epner must learn how to cope with an age-old truth; life can change in a heartbeat.

Andrew's Blu-ray Review: Cinema is littered with failed film made by big stars turned first-time directors. Eddie Murphy's 'Harlem Nights,' Ethan Hawke's 'The Hottest State,' Alan Cumming and Jennifer Jason Leigh's 'The Anniversary Party' and Madonna's recent 'Filth & Wisdom' are just a few examples of arguably terrible films that are clear reminders that sometimes, actors should stick to their day jobs. So it's a very nice surprise when, every once in a while, a film made by a thespian comes along that actually isn't entirely dreadful. Helen Hunt's 'Then She Found Me' is just such a film, one that's certainly flawed but made with such obvious passion that you want to cheer Hunt on just for getting more right than wrong.

Based on the book by Elinor Lipman, Helen Hunt not only stars and directs, but also co-wrote the screenplay with Alice Arlen and Victor Levin. She retains the basic structure of Elinor Lipman's novel if streamlining many of its subplots and characters. The premise veers into Woody Allen territory, a slice of Jewish urban angst that sees Hunt as New York schoolteacher April Epner, a recent divorcee whose ex-husband John Benjamin [Matthew Broderick] left her because of her desire to have children, which is only compounded after her adoptive mother unexpectedly dies. Attempting to re-start her life, April finds herself in a myriad of dramedy complications, including the return of her intrusive biological mother [Bette Midler], her comically morose brother [Ben Shenkman] and a potential new boyfriend [Colin Firth] who is the father of one of her students.

The story of 'Then She Found Me' is nothing new. It's Female Empowerment, and had the tone been comedic. We can immediately anticipate all of the staple scenes to come, including April Epner's first slapstick encounter with Ms. Bette Midler, her meeting with the cute Colin Firth, and the eventual return of Benjamin, just at the moment when April will need to make her crucial romantic decision of whether to pursue her new suitor. Though Helen Hunt's script and direction are blatant in bringing Victor Lipman's spiritual and thematic concerns to the fore, which gives 'Then She Found Me' an intellectual bent rare for a romantic comedy, it remains a bit too precious to truly surmount the limitations of its genre.

Indeed, April Epner herself can be insufferable. Her predicament is certainly relatable, but her lack of humour and warmth (which is not helped by Hunt, who can come off as a cold actress) is not. It's intriguing that, as she elaborates on the included audio commentary, Hunt laboured for so many years to bring this story to the screen. April's realisations are ultimately not all that revelatory, and her frequent wallowing in self-pity often makes her seem a passive bystander in her own life rather than an active participant. It's often frustrating to watch, and the film's denouement just isn't emotionally transformative enough to truly make the journey worth it.

What Helen Hunt does succeed in bringing to 'Then She Found Me' is insight and earnestness, sort of like a distaff Edward Burns film but far less pretentious and grating. Helen Hunt is refreshing in her lack of visual ticks and self-conscious camera moves, and instead aims for the immediacy of a stage play. Her style is workmanlike and unpretentious (the Woody Allen influence is clear), which allows the fine cast to shine. Though I found Ms. Bette Midler slightly annoying in this, but still gives a good performance, despite this slight problem of being slightly over the top, whereas Colin Firth brings a real charm to a potentially awkward character, while the underrated Ben Shenkman provides plenty of droll laughs. Ironically, Helen Hunt's own performance suffers even more by comparison, as Helen Hunt sometimes feels overwhelmed by the other characters in the film, they steal the show.

'Then She Found Me' is ultimately a small movie in every sense of the word, but not quite a real sleeper. Its lead character is just too oft-putting, and the story's themes too off-the-rack. Yet at the same time, Hunt is so committed to her story and her filmmaking that 'Then She Found Me' is a film that you can't help but root for. It's refreshing to find a film these days whose maker truly seemed determined to make.

Blu-ray Video Quality  'Then She Found Me' is hardly the type of material that screams high-definition, but this 1080p encode image is very nice and pleasant, delivering a good-looking picture but nothing more. The film has a realistic, non-stylised appearance. Colours are well-saturated and natural, if on the bland side. The transfer handles the palette well, however, with a clean look and accurate flesh tones. Detail is merely average, with a softness to the image which flattens out depth. The source is in good shape, however, with nice blacks and smooth contrast. Shadow delineation is average as well, with darker scenes offering little real fine texture. There are no major compression artefacts, and noise and edge enhancement are not problematic.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  I didn't expect much from the audio on 'Then She Found Me,' but this is quite a strong English 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio Surround soundtrack. It serves the material very well, and even has a few moments of inspired subtlety. I liked how well-done discrete effects and atmosphere are, which gives this mix a surprisingly strong rear presence. The back channels are usually alive with minor effects or score bleed, and sometimes more pronounced moments. The quality of the recording is likewise impressive, with a wide dynamic range and low bass that is prominent but non-intrusive. Dialogue is also front-and-centre, as it should be, with spoken words always intelligible and never overwhelmed by the rest of the mix. Sure, 'Then She Found Me' is not a demo disc, but it's hard to imagine the material could have been served more properly.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Audio Commentary: Commentary with Helen Hunt: Helen Hunt flies solo on this track, and it is one of the best I've heard in ages. This first-time director explains that she came into her first commentary completely prepared, aiming the track at fellow neophyte filmmakers. Her extensive experience as an actress who has worked with some of the greats is also well in evidence, and she comes off as intelligent and insightful about every aspect of her film and craft. She also provides a welcome thesis on the film's main themes, as well as continual detail on how she structured each scene. Thorough, witty, and passionate, Hunt shows us how a commentary is done right.

Special Feature: Interviews [1080p] [1.78:1] [28:00] Nearly a half-hour of interviews is included, with Helen Hunt and stars Colin Firth, Bette Midler, and Matthew Broderick. An off-screen interviewer guides the discussion, and if these chats are static in presentation, the content is very strong. (Only Helen Hunt's nearly 10-minute talk is a bit redundant after the commentary).

Theatrical Trailer [2007] [1080p] [1.78:1] [2:30] The film's original trailer is provided in full HD video.

Finally, 'Then She Found Me' is a small but very engaging film, and a notable directorial debut for star Helen Hunt. This Blu-ray gives it a fine presentation, with good video and nice audio sound and a few worthwhile supplements. Still, 'Then She Found Me' isn't really material that calls out for a high-definition presentation, the Blu-ray release is undoubtedly the best this film will look for quite some time. Devoted fans of the film's actors may be curious to check this title out, but otherwise, `Then She Found Me' will probably float under the radar for most people, but if you are in the mood for something different on Blu-ray, then this is definitely worth a look and it is a wonderful winner all the way, as I never got to see this when it was released in the cinema, but wow what a joy to get this Blu-ray as all the actors give a truly outstanding performance and should of got some kind of gong for their efforts. But one word of warning, get your Kleenex tissues out, as this is a 10 hanky emotional roller coaster emotional ride and I am so proud to add this to my ever increasing Ms. Bette Midler Blu-ray Collection, as I cannot praise this film enough. Highly Recommended!

3490392,3,B001BEK86K,"While Helen Hunt gives an outstanding performance as usual, the messages portrayed here about marital fidelity and building a new romance are troubling.  The audience is told that the husband will always be a hopeless jerk and the new guy will always be prince charming, but I was not totally convinced either of these things were set in stone.  What kind of single father would keep allowing himself into the center of a married woman's life when she so desperately needs to sort out other things?",1391644800,,498,4.77906976744186

3490394,1,B001BEK86K,"The worse movie, ever. How is this possible? I adore the novelist, Elinor Lipman. I love Helen Hunt, Bette Midler, and Colin Firth. But this movie? Unbearably bad. Helen Hunt was wooden, stilted, affected, ridiculous. Her attempt at sadness came across as haggard and unbelievable. The entire film was a waste of time. Thank god it was a DVD from the library so I could turn it off after 30 mins w/o regretting the cost. What a bomb!",1385164800,,433,4.564102564102564

3490396,5,B001BEK86K,"This is a great 'forget where you are' movie staring some of my most favorite actors: Colin Firth, Matthew Broderick, Helen Hunt (who is always amazing), Bette Midler, and it was directed by Helen Hunt!  The story revolves around Helen Hunt's character, April Epner, as she separates from her husband, Matthew Broderick (both Helen Hunt and Matthew Broderick have been acting since their early teens and those movies are timeless and great fun!) and her adoptive mother dies. As April, who is a school teacher, falls for the father of one of her students, Colin Firth, (what woman would not want Colin Firth as a significant other?), her birth mother, played by Bette Midler, renters her life and tries her best to be a good mother to an adult daughter in crisis, who is basically a total stranger.  April's life is turned upside down and as she finds balance and love, it is impossible for the viewer not to root for her success and happiness, while falling in love with the actors.  This movie is 'warm', funny, touching and loving, with lots of laughs along the way.  Turn off the phones, cover the windows, put a DO NOT DISTURB sign on the door, pop a big bowlful of pop corn and coat it with lots of hot butter, then sit back and relax, turn on the movie and be prepared to laugh, be teary-eyed, and surprised at how quickly one person's life can change.",1379203200,,1359,4.557377049180328

3490401,3,B001BEK86K,"The actors/actresses aided in the appeal of this movie, but the story was somewhat lackluster. The storyline overlaps several different relationships among the characters so it was challenging at times to sort out which relationship was the focus, and with which characters was the main conflict? Helen Hunt draws sympathy; Colin Firth was....well, lovable Colin Firth; Bette Midler makes it difficult to be too angry with her character; Matthew Broderick does what he can with a flat character.
Hard to decipher the theme until you get through the entire film; then it all comes clear.
Addresses many levels:both a strength and a weakness.",1378252800,,640,5.223300970873787

In real life, she would not have met someone like Colin Firth and have him call her beautiful and immediately fall in love with her. She looked like an old hag. And that hair! Horrible. The story line was not at all believable. None of the characters were really likable and there was zero entertainment factor to this movie, except maybe looking at Colin sometimes. Matthew Broderick was annoying and whiny. Bette was ok. At least she looked good and was happy. I wonder why Colin and Bette did this movie?! He does a lot of crappy movies though.

I loved the premise of this movie.  It was a believable set of circumstances that tugs at so many mixed feelings.  I cheered for the baby and mourned when she was lost.  After being left by her immature husband, losing her adopted mother and being found by her birth mother Helen Hunt is understandably confused about the next step in her life.  Then comes along someone whom she is immediately drawn to; someone who sees the real person. I won't go into anymore detail other than to say that the rest of the movie is wonderfully written and acted and so worth your time.

3490506,4,B001BEK86K,"Fine, complex and full of deep insights.  The adoption story was very moving to me personally.  It was extremely funny and also very substantial in dealing with the emotions and relationships.  Helen Hunt was great as star and director.  Bette Midler made it for me!  She was her usual hilarious eccentric self.  And of course, Colin Firth was magnificent.

 I felt disheartened at the usual worldly solution to intimacy: getting sexually involved too soon without developing a firm foundation of long lasting friendship.  I have been there and learned that it usually doesn't work out over time.  Too much heartbreak and divorce. Sexual immorality is rampant now in U.S. So I'm sad this wonderful movie condoned it and that the ending was left up in the air without a solid foundation of hope.

All this said, I was rapt with attention throughout, having been the ""birth mother "" like Bette.  I also liked the Jewish traditions and the prayers said by Helen Hunt when her mother prompted her.  The whole movie was a laudable feat by Helen Hunt and all the cast and crew.  I do wonder the reason for the story about the little Jewish boy jumping and his father deliberately not catching him.
Was it a lesson on not trusting parents or people or life?  Perhaps we need to learn to trust in God more than man.

The only thing keeping me from giving this movie a 5-star rating was the foul language. Unfortunately, the powers that be felt it was necessary to use God's name in vain far too often - of course, ONCE is too often in MY opinion. It's just so unnecessary and could easily be avoided withOUT affecting viewers' opinions of the movie. I mean, I don't think anyone really watches a movie FOR THE PURPOSE of listening to such things.

I put it aside deciding I wouldn't watch it.  But then I came back later when I had a curiosity of what would happen next, since I knew a good deal of the film was left.  And I'm glad I did.  It was far from unrealistic.

The acting was amazing.  Some of the scenes where Helen was upset were so believable I could barely believe it.  I did sort of wonder whether Helen was making a bad choice with Colin.  I mean, he seems like he might border on becoming abusive.  The words he used to her when he was very angry were shocking and showed an explosive anger where someone will act on it.  And dealing with those sort of unrealistic expectations and jealousy would be scary and perhaps stifling later on.  However, it was very real.  Things like this happen.  People do react this way.

I loved the speech by Helen when she told him that they would undoubtedly hurt each other.  I think it was a good message.  To know that things can't always be perfect.

This movie moved me and touched me.  While I agree that the characters were not overly likable, this was a great story nonetheless.  The cherry on top to give you some good feelings leaving this story was the scene at the end.  I won't say what happens to give it away.  I was honestly surprised by it though, but it also seemed somehow right, especially when you see the person in real life at the end.",1368230400,,1587,4.2727272727272725

I say all that to say that I hated this movie so much that I watched it again to figure out why I hated it.

1- It's boring.
2- The plot is barely believable.
3- Helen Hunt spends half the movie trying to console herself with acupressure. Incorrectly. It's maddening to watch. It's like acupuncture, but you tap instead of using needles. How hard is that? That she ""fell"" for this is supposed to be some kind of testament to how stupid she is. But that's not why her character is dumb. She's dumb because she exists.
4- I love Helen Hunt and Bettle Midler and they did their best with this mess of a script. The dialogue is as boring and as dumb as the plot though.

The idea of the plot is great. It sounds like no one could mess it up. I don't know if it happened in editing or if the script was this bad all the way through. But it just doesn't work.",1366329600,,1087,4.098591549295775

Sometimes we don't get what we want, what we imagine will make us happy or feel complete.  But that doesn't mean we can't find contentment -- lasting happiness comes from finding that sweet spot between never totally giving up and yet learning to accept that things may be different than we originally hoped.

The performances were all good -- I wondered if I would find the mother/daughter portrayal realistic at first since I think the temperments of both actors are so different but it really did draw me in.

3490877,2,B001BEK86K,"The most frustrating aspect of this film was the stilted dialogue--so often I felt like I was watching a poorly played out high school play instead of an on-screen film. The first 30 minutes seemed stilted & disconnected, and the relationship between Hunt's character & her husband played by Broderick didn't make sense to me at all. They had no physical nor sexual chemistry, so I could never understand the love-making scenes where he always seemed to get more from her than she got from anything in her life. Conversations between characters were worse than just awkward--they seemed almost always inappropriate and unrealistic. A biological mother just happens to pop in on a woman's life with aplomb and not an ounce of sensitivity, just barreling in like a bull in a China shop knowing her mother (adopted) has recently passed away--what was her motivation? Why look up her daughter now? Nothing ever hung together. The adopted relationships, the married relationships, the in-laws, the biological relationships, the marriages & divorces, the new relationships--every single one was missing Truth, emotion & any sense of pull. In other words, after 100 minutes I couldn't have cared too much LESS what happened to this sorry supposed 39-year-old woman with a barren womb. And, from Scene One I thought she looked sooooo much older than Broderick that from the outset Hunt was miscast. She didn't seem Jewish, she didn't seem like a school teacher, she didn't express any emotion when her adopted mother--her MOTHER--died . . .  her acting was flat! She pulled the same upward glance with squinty eyes & pull-back of that hair strand that Hunt just does. It fell short of what it could have been.

Sadly, the focus of this movie is also confusing regarding adoption. Was Midler's character regretful for having given up her child, or did she think she'd given her daughter a better life? Why did she perpetually lie to Hunt? Was Hunt ever thankful to have been adopted, or did she only have adoptee regret & grief? SPOILER: in the end, she adopted a daughter, herself, from China, where ""they throw babies in trash cans"" (as spoken by both of her mothers). So, are we to feel for that Chinese daughter that she got a good life with a father who thinks his only job is to raise his children until they can fend for themselves, but that he isn't required to even like that, and with a woman who chose adoption as her LAST ditch desperate act? Her adopted mother told Hunt ""There is no difference,"" (between her biological child & her adopted child), and we watched Hunt's character try everything in the world before she'd consider adopting from China to discover whether her mother had been right. So, in the end there she is smiling at her Chinese baby, and  . . . what does this communicate about Chinese adoption? I'd say all parents in America who have adopted from China would find this movie offensive. Many of my friends have Chinese sons & daughters, and for them it was a calling not just to fulfill their need for some complete ""family,"" but to be in the business of bringing a child out of a tragic situation into Life!; not a last ditched effort to fulfill some selfish hunger (Hunt talks about the desire to be a mother as being like the need to pee), or like an itch that just HAD to be scratched. I kept asking myself throughout the movie, ""What is this saying about adoption!?"" And even to the end I am not sure what the final message was. What was the point!? That women should seek all means necessary to fulfill their needs in all ways regardless of who gets harmed along the way (desperate love-making in the back seat of her car with her soon-to-be-ex-husband loser, for example)? There were all these random soliloquies &/or monologues spoken by Hunt's & Firth's characters that seemed to serve the writers' needs to hear themselves speak rather than add any helpful texture to the storyline. . . and they hung in the air without connection b/c they were delivered poorly, or delivered in an environment where the chemistry didn't complement the script.

I've spent too much time reviewing this film. It failed to do its job.

All the main characters, with the exception of Colin Firth's, are unlikeable and untrustworthy, but Helen Hunt's character is so dopey (really...sex in the car parked at a busy public  sidewalk with your ex in the middle of the day with the door open...really?) and her final speech so overwrought that Colin Firth looks like an idiot to buy it.",1363305600,,434,4.931506849315069

The characters felt real and not dolled up. Bernice is played wonderfully. And although you hate her  at first, you learn to love her by the end (just as April does).  The film didn't show life as a pretty, wrapped up packed. It showed it as hard and tragic, but still full of love and beauty. I feel more inspired by this show then I have by any show in a long time.

3490935,1,B001BEK86K,"I watched this film because of the cast. These are all fine actors but find themselves in what comes across as an amateurish attempt at a Woody Allen movie gone hay wire. Helen Hunt is a 39 year old, who looks more like 69, whose sole aim in life is to bear a child. Why did she wait so long to have a baby and to marry? Her husband of a few months suddenly leaves her for no apparent reason other than he is a jerk of some kind. Then her birth mother appears just when her adopted mother is dies and is buried.  Her real mother looks about 20 years younger than her.  The mother is a nonsensical liar and basic nit wit who can only speak in riddles.  Then we have Colin Firth totally miscast as a rather selfish boob.  All the characters speak in double meaning gibberish which is meant to sound sophisticated and meaningful but is pure nonsense.  Don't waste your time on this really terrible film. Where do they find such talentless screen writers ? I wish I had not found this movie.",1362528000,,987,4.2287234042553195

Since I was bored I had plenty of time to think: is Colin Firth ashamed of having made this thing?, how did they get Bette Midler to agree to be in this movie?, who was the guy always with the Bette Midler character? why is her brother absent so much of the film? And in general why is the Helen Hunt character so unlikeable and yet is so loved by her mother, bio-mother, brother and two men? There is nothing to make all those people want to be with her.

What torture. Horrible movie with disfunctional characters that behave like fools.  Then finally Bette walked in and saved the day, she didn't have any great script to rely on though.  Helen Hunt and Matthew Broderick don't have any chemistry and they're not believable as a couple so when things get rocky in their marriage you find yourself rooting for the break up.  Helen's more believable with Colin Firth but her role makes her out to be an idiot.  There's nothing interesting about this movie, not even the setting.

Although she has awful things happen to her, like her husband leaving,she has sex with him in a car with the door open on a public street.  What?

Then I started thinking about the foul language. Do adults really talk like this today? I haven't known anyone who talks like this since I finished freshman year of college some decades ago. Do adults about to get divorced get so consumed by lust for one another that they start having sex in an open car on the street in broad daylight? I began thinking about what Hollywood presents as desirable lifestyles. How's that working out for people? Why are they always so confused and unhappy and dysfunctional. Then I realized it's because they have failed in their most basic assignment as human beings. They have failed to get wisdom. So many bad choices leading to so much unhappiness. So while I enjoyed some aspects of this movie, on the whole it fails to entertain or inform.

3491002,2,B001BEK86K,"I am a guy and I often like ""women's"" movies - either carefree chick flicks, sappy romances, or on occasion, serious movies with really defective people - e.g. like Halle Berry in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Monster-s-Ball/dp/B006SV622U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Monster's Ball</a>.  Knowing this movie was going to one of these, I was astonished how far from good this movie was with Helen Hunt and Colin Firth in it - I had expected a great movie - but it was all I could do to watch it.  The story line is fairly preposterous and doubles down later to sheer incredulity.

Hunt's character is a 39 year old woman who teaches Elementary school children.  Helen Hunt is a beautiful woman but the make up/style in this movie makes her look like a disheveled late 40's woman who has bulimia, she really looks awful in almost every scene (very few beautiful women can pull this off, unfortunately Helen Hunt does not do it here).  We find out she was adopted by a Jewish family in some odd out-of-place family scenes.  She marries a Jewish man (played by Matthew Broderick, who was terribly miscast in this role).  That marriage ends quickly and very awkwardly.  The rest of the movie is a disjointed plot/subplot story . . . Hunt's character's actual mother (played by Bette Midler), who is some kind of TV talk show host, appears out of no where, and wants a mother-daughter relationship with her 39 year old daughter.  The other story line is another very awkward love story with Firth's character, a parent of a student in Hunt's class.  Firth's character has odd habits - never explained or tied into anything (did his wife die? leave him for another man? woman? why, he seems almost perfect?)

Hunt's character starts dating Firth's character almost immediately after her marriage ends.  She finds out she is pregnant (by the ex-husband, they had awkward in-the-kitchen sex the night he left??) and then the preposterous part of the story really kicks into gear.  She goes to the doctor first with the ex husband and Firth's character; later after a fight, her brother from her adopted family comes with her, the ex husband brings a date?  In between, the ex-husband asks for a ride home from a doctor appointment, and Hunt's character has sex with him in broad daylight in the back seat of her car.  (an awkward, silly scene)

In the sub story, Hunt's character does not believe her newly found mother (who appears in many scenes with a guy whose point/role is never explained).  I could not here explain fully how bizarre most of this plot is . . . there is a point that Hunt's character does a DNA test from stolen hair, and then blackmails the mother to pay for fertility drugs after she has a miscarriage.  This just seemed implausible from such a meek character.  The mother lies to Hunt's character about all kinds of things, and then starts stalking her daughter after the lies turn to shunning.  The whole subplot just was uninteresting.  The movie ends abruptly when it appears that she adopts a child instead of having one.

Hunt plays her character very dead pan throughout the movie - as if her life was pointless - and in the end, I just did not care about her life, any more than she did in the movie.

To the extent this movie was trying to be ""realistic"" in portraying life, in my view it failed miserably.  The character interactions are very disjointed and often unexplained.  Some scenes looked as if they were cut in for some point that was never set up (for example, Midler's character comments on a 50 year old guy's but, and then later might be sleeping with him, but who is he, why? it just made no sense - we had already figured out she was a narcissist).  People do not pick up a date and first go to an ex-wife's ultrasound, unless the date is a prostitute.  This movie just does not come off at all realistic.  Or entertaining.

If you like really depressing movies with characters that meander through life, do pointless things, interact in unrealistic manners, and then the movie just ends . . . then you might like this.  Otherwise, do yourself a favor and spend 2 hours doing something else more life enriching . . .",1357430400,,4200,4.729395604395604

I give it a 5 to give the overall score a boost: perhaps it deserves a 4.  This is a good film and should be seen.  I'm not terribly fond of Hunt's acting style (in my opinion, an actress who does not rise above herself) -- but in this role she is believable and earnest and her character (the lead) is someone who, despite faults enough, engenders deep sympathy.  I would not call this a romantic comedy (romantic drama perhaps) and would caution anyone looking for a feel-good comedic romp to steer clear.  This is a thoughtful, well-directed, well-acted, and intelligently written etude.  The three leads are superb.  Midler is a joy to watch with many Midlerian moments (casting her in this role was brilliant as she lightens the load); Firth his own commanding self; Hunt is strong and carries the through-line of the film to a satisfying conclusion. By all means, a very worthwhile film with much to say about loving our children: those who come to us in our adult life, and those we left behind in our own past.  Hunt could have spent a little more time developing the important theme of familial love: since the message of the film is ""love is work but love is all there is"" there could have been a bit more time spent developing these kid-love, family-love connections.  I saw more of her angst than her love (she does very good angst); not until the last scene where she takes her time shooting a promenade with her daughter, do I feel the power of her heart.",1354406400,,1644,4.63448275862069

His portrayal of a loving single father in this movie is heart warming and heart wrenching.  Helen Hunt's performance as a 30-something dying to have a baby is well portrayed.  The drama is bittersweet between the loss of her baby and the developing relationship with Firth's character.  At times you just want to wring her neck for the way she treats him.  Matthew Broderick is in and gone but does a fine job as a Peter Pan momma's boy while Bette Midler delivers an outstanding performance as the mother who gave her daughter (Hunt) away.  Could have a used a little more time building on the dynamic of the adopted family, but the adopted Mom is killed off too soon and the devoted brother doesn't get enough airplay either.  The best part is this movie takes real life drama (you know these characters in your own family, friends and neighbors) and still leaves you with hope that they will overcome it all.

This movie might have been along the same theme, a mid-life crisis, but it was done with such heart and compassion, that I watched it over and over. I didn't even watch the other movie more than half way through.  All evidence pointed to a predictable ending.  This movie didn't have a predictable ending.  I feel that many women can identify with the plot, a woman in one crisis after another.  And, there is a lesson to be learned, staying focused on the ultiamte goal, and there is a brighter world on the other side of all of the trauma.  One could almost say this movie could be alighned with Wayne Dyer's ""The Shift,"" where a person makes a big shift in his/her life and life is never the same.

Okay, I admit it right now that I prefer watching a venerable no brainer like ""Smokey and the Bandit"" verse a therapy session disguised as a feature film with a couple of name actresses, but that's who I am.

I think someone ought to address whoever the screenplay artist was, get the real doctor's and patient's names upon whom this screenplay was based, and then present them to the world for all to see.  Not that that would make any difference, but perhaps it might serve to producers to select more entertaining fair mainstream audiences.

Then Hunt discovers she is pregnant and at the same time finds out her birth mother (Bette Midler) that gave her up now wants to be part of her life. Bette Midlers character is suppose to be annoying and narcissistic so she is well cast. Colin Firth is the good and sane relationship in her life.

I just couldn't make it to the end. All I could think about was how bad Hunt looked; is she anorexic?. Something seriously wrong here: Bette was born in 1945, Hunt in 1963! While I admire Hunt for her work offscreen getting the book made into a film, I'm afraid it wasn't worth the effort. I'm glad I got this through Amazon Prime.

Helen Hunt is excellent, as usual. Bette Midler is excellent, as usual. Colin Firth is also excellent, as usual. Sorry, I'm not a Broderick fan - so am uncertain if it was his character or him.

Confusion rules the movie, it's emotional without a lot of emotional displays - very reigned in, yet effective. It's a strong topic, delivered well - but no way would I call it a comedy. Yes there are a few chuckles, but it's not funny at all.  Wrapping it up the message comes through so beautifully that it was worth sitting through, enjoyable and yet doubtful of repeating.

I decided to buy it anyway, since I absolutely adore Colin Firth and Bette Midler.  I found it to be a warm, funny, thoughtful movie.  Helen Hunt does a wonderful job playing a woman who could have easily slipped too far into her tragedies.  It was lovely to see Colin Firth in something other than the ""dour Englishman"" role.  His is another character that could have played strictly to the tragic elements of his life, but Colin shows a range he's not often allowed to play.  He is by turns funny, loving, neurotic, and just a little bit cruel.  Matthew Broderick is good, sort of a not-quite-grown-up Ferris Bueller.  And Bette - what can I say about Bette?

One wonders what the Colin Firth character (why there are 2 starts isatead of 1) sees in her.  Normally I like these actors, but ... don't waste your time!",1328054400,,429,4.631578947368421
3491049,4,B001BEK86K,"Helen Hunt stars and directs a film that depicts the life of a 39 year old woman who wants it all. She wants a career, a marriage, a family and happy ever after. And, then one day it all falls apart.

April Epner, played by Helen Hunt teaches kindergarten, her husband played by Matthew Broderick is also a teacher. As we meet them they are having a Jewish religious holiday in the hospital with April's adopted mother. It is easily apparent that relations between April and her adopted mother are not all they should be. That night, April's husband tells her he loves someone else, and before he leaves they have hasty sex on the kitchen floor. April who is heartbroken faces the world in a haze, and on top of it all her adoptive mother dies. Life goes on, her friends and in particular her brother are her support. One day out of the blue a man comes to her school to ask her to meet with her birth mother, Beatrice, played by Bette Midler. Beatirce is an over the top local talk-show personality. On the same day that April meets her mother she also meets one of her student's father. They are both instantly hooked. They dance around having a date for awhile, but after a bit they decide their love is real. The relationship with real mom is up and down and April reaches a true conundrum.

This could be a very sappy film, but Helen Hunt's excellent direction saves it. Helen wears not much make-up, she looks pale and thin. Her new boyfriend, played by Colin Firth is rugged, a nice term for a little fat, solvely dad. He is all taken up in caring for his two young children, they were all left by his wife, their mother who is traveling through Europe with a new lover. Beatrice is as she should be, funny, really over the top as only Bette Midler can be, but filled with common sense and seems to instinctively knows how to behave. Matthew Broderick is a young mommy's boy and someone to avoid at all costs. The storyline may be trite to some, but I think it was well written and superbly acted. April's gynecologist is Salman Rushdie, for gosh sakes!

This is a film that all women will appreciate and men if they are really men. I found it charming and so well done.

I kept waiting to care about the characters in this film but, after wasting the nearly 2 hours it took to get to the end of the story, I found that NONE of the characters had a single redeeming or likable quality and I couldn't have cared less about how any of them ended up.

I'll admit that I've never much liked Helen Hunt as an actor but, since I do (usually) like the other leading actors, I didn't but should have followed my better instincts to just shut the film off.

What this film shows are 4 different examples of totally messed up adults that never managed to mature.  The ONLY ""grown up"" decision was made by one of the characters at the age of 15.  Beyond that, nothing but emotional cripples.  Sound like your cup of tea?  It sure doesn't come close to mine!

I'd recommend you pass on this one.

3491056,3,B001BEK86K,"Loved Colin Firth. Broderick is, as one reviewer mentioned, rather flat.  Helen Hunt is an exceptional actress, but I found her disturbingly thin in this movie.  The gauntness with the psychological travails seemed overwhelming and her normal beautiful face cast in a life-disappointment frown most of the time.  Bette Midler will always be the Goddess I hope to channel in myself.  The journey is plausible.  Humans often make the same mistakes over again until finally they get whatever lesson is there for them which pops them out of the loop.  It all works out in a way that makes sense, but I'm left with this thin, sad, image of Helen Hunt who is so frail as to seem much older.  I hope she's okay.",1314230400,,704,4.629032258064516
3491057,2,B001BEK86K,"In reality my review reflects more on Helen Hunt's appearance than the movie itself.  It is difficult to evaluate and appreciate the movie when you are bogged down by the appearance of one of the actors.  Hunt has aged considerably and quickly and additionally looks oddly thin.  I am all for an aging actress landing a role and doing so without Botox and other wonders of modern medicine, however, casting such an actress appropriately is essential to the flow of a film.  In this movie, Hunt plays a 38 year old, while in reality she was 43, and looks beyond her 43 years.  It is not a good casting decision. Unfortunately, Hunt directs and obviously made a poor decision here.  Normally, I would hate to criticize appearances, but when casting someone to play a character a few years younger, the actress needs to convincingly convey a younger look.  The opposite happened here, with a character that looks ten years older than she is portrayed.",1312070400,,948,4.7439024390243905

I found the story line to be very beliveable and heart warming.  Anyone who has struggled with the need of having a baby will relate.

3491063,4,B001BEK86K,"""Then She Found Me"" was an interesting view of a woman's life, funny in ways, but very focused on being abandoned by natural mother, adopted mother (who dies), and an immature husband who does not know what he wants. She loses a baby she dearly wants.  Helen Hunt plays a deeply religious Jewish, gaunt, New York schoolteacher, who has several life changes smack her in the face as she turns 39.  She is childless and trying to have a baby with a blubbering child-like husband.  She feels she is on the brink, pressured to have a natural baby but can't.  She even goes to her brother for a chance to be a mother - in an embarrassing scene.

The changes in her life happen at rapid speed, her husband leaves her, her adoptive mother dies, and a crazy talk show host (Bette Midler) shows up and says she is her real mother, and also lies that her real father is Steve McQueen!  Helen Hunt surprised me in a performance free of ego, she looked tired and old, and too thin to boot, but her performance works, and weaves you into this unglamorous life story.

Crazy movie but I enjoyed it.",1303257600,,1084,4.39
3491064,4,B001BEK86K,"Others here have well-reviewed the plot.  While some compare it to a Lifetime effort, I see it as much more.  The screenplay is creative and consistently engaging (a perspective free of Lifetime's formulaic, cliche-filled approach). Also unlike LIfetime, it doesn't exploit tragedy.  Rather, the script is fresh and filled with clever humor.

The casting is so good that there's not even a weak minor character in the effort. For starters, Helen Hunt is believable and likable in her haphazard love life and quest to be a mom.  She often blurts the truth of a situation, which adds punch to any interaction.  The story line honors her struggles by showing her as thin and unglamorous, an approach which respects the audience, in my opinion.  Conversely, a disrespectful approach is taken when characters are shown behaving like fools/idiots, along with the embedded message that because these stunted individual are dripping with wealth, the behaviors are ""normal."" (As you breeze through evening TV selections this week, note how your awareness of poor behaviors perhaps is blunted by shows of wealth and/or lavish glamor.)

Midler deliciously delights and irritates as the birth mom.  I loved every single scene she appeared in.  In her brief appearance, the adoptive mom is well-defined as controlling but loving.  The brother come across as a quiet ally--always there when Hunt needs him (love brothers like that!). Matthew Broderick's eternal adolescence is so naturally portrayed that (at one point), I had to remind myself that he was playing a role and this wasn't his real personality.  Colin Firth gives a well-nuanced performance as a devoted dad (a real stand-up guy), who is attracted to the Hunt character.

Hunt's character's choices were often self-sabotaging, but I cared about her enough to reflect on why she might act like that.  (This means the movie did a good job of fleshing her out, else there'd be nothing to reflect upon.)  Maybe she started life emotionally ungrounded, due to her mother's struggles with her for a year before the baby was adopted.  Maybe this insecurity expanded when she perceived that her adoptive mother didn't look at her with the same loving eyes as she looked at her birth son.  Later, the ground beneath Hunt's feet quakes even further when a series of significant losses befall Hunt in a stunningly brief period of time.

In light of the above, I wondered if Hunt's character tended to default to choices which reduced her emotional risk (a form of staying numb).  As for that numbness, Hunt's response to a series of losses was (to me) glossed over and not true to reality.  However, perhaps the intention was to portray Hunt as disconnected from herself.

Here's a message I took from the movie.  If life has already dealt some blows, then it's easy to default to  ""known"" pain (pain you know you can live with--even if it reaps no happiness).  It's frightening to then go beyond that, for the unknown pain of pursuing one's dreams, but the human spirit keeps nudging for that anyway.  The movie points to the necessity of a grounded inner life, combined with the support/help of people who want the best for you.  As for defaulting to known pain, it strikes me that it's like treading water.  It offers the illusion that movement is happening, while dulling awareness of zero progression.  In adopting this approach, one never actually drowns.  Yet, ""not drowning"" does not equate to living life fully.  Sorting out these issues became Hunt's challenge.

Nearly every movie has daydream scenes, but there weren't many of them for me in this instance.  In particular, I was struck by the scene involving a challenge Midler makes when Hunt (in hospital garb) is ready for a procedure.  The outcome is surprising and meaningful (a welcomed counter-point to the light touch of other scenes).  There, Midler got to signal new depth to her embrace of late in life motherhood.  A second memorable scene takes place in Midler's dressing room, where Hunt (advised by her brother), makes a request.  The conviction Hunt brought was bracing--a welcomed triumph over past efforts of vaguely wobbling towards her goals.

Does Hunt ever re-direct enough to make her life work?  Rich with reality doses regarding the messiness of relationships, the movie weaves a believable answer, and is entertaining to boot. I cheerfully recommend it.

A final thought: how refreshing it would be if people in real life spoke so constructively, so directly, and with such emotional honesty!",1301184000,,4519,5.006702412868632
3491065,4,B001BEK86K,"Helen Hunt, who has grown as an actor, directed herself in Then She Found Me. Loosely based on the novel of the same title, Ms. Hunt plays April Epner, a woman who has made a late marriage that fails in less than a year. She wants nothing more than to become a mother, and now, at age 39, she fears her chances have slipped away when her husband takes off. No sooner does she find herself abandoned than she receives overtures from her previously unknown birth mother, who hopes to develop a relationship with the daughter she so long ago gave up for adoption. Serendipitously, April meets a divorced man with 2 kids of his own, and the attraction is mutual.

The theme of this story has to do with the feelings of an adoptee who wants to give birth to her own child rather than adopt. Naturally, April's emotions are conflicted, and she needs to work them through before she can move forward in her own life. As director, Ms. Hunt admirably prevented this film from becoming maudlin or mawkish. April runs the gamut of emotions, as does her new love interest, Colin Firth, who was unceremoniously dumped by his own wife. Perhaps the most outstanding performance is delivered by Bette Midler, who is larger than life in real life, but restrains herself in the role of April's birth mother, now a spoiled TV celebrity. I don't know if Ms. Hunt is Jewish, but her treatment of the religious overtones in this story is exemplary, also real but restrained. Matthew Broderick does as well as can be expected in the thankless role of April's fickle husband.

The main problems with this otherwise charming movie are the rather dull cinematography and some clumsy editing. My recommendation is to read the novel, watch the DVD, but don't expect the same things from them.",1301011200,,1764,4.6506410256410255
3491066,3,B001BEK86K,"Played by first-time director Helen Hunt, April is a 39-year-old elementary school teacher in Brooklyn whose biological clock has been ticking so loudly it's been keeping her up at night.  But that's just the beginning of her woes.  Her husband of just a few months (Matthew Broderick) has left her; her adoptive mother has just died; and a crazy lady (Bette Midler) - a local TV talk show host - is claiming to be her biological mother (with Steve McQueen as her father, no less).  Then, just as her midlife crisis is coming to a boil, in steps a conveniently abandoned father of two (Colin Firth) - one of whom is April's pupil - to sweep her off her feet, though he comes with his own share of problems as well.

Though ""Then She Found Me"" is not quite as shopworn and trite as that synopsis may make it sound, it's still an uneasy mixture of insightful drama and plot-tweaking contrivance.  In fact, the Alice Arlen/Victor Levin/Helen Hunt screenplay, based on the 1990 novel by Elinor Lipman, tries so hard to be unconventional that it often winds up feeling fake.  On the positive side, though, the acting is good (why have we seen so little of Hunt on screen since she won her Oscar fourteen years ago?); the characters skew a little older than your typical romantic comedy figures; the story ends on a tremendously sweet note, and there's just enough genuine humor and charm in the movie to make it worth a look-see.

One side note: the movie makes a continuity error by claiming that April was conceived in 1966 when McQueen was off in China filming ""The Sand Pebbles,"" but later we're told she was conceived when her mother was at a drive-in showing of ""Bullitt,"" which wasn't even released until 1968!",1297900800,,1712,4.6118421052631575

The relationships dominate this movie:  Ben wishing he hadn't left April, April meeting Frank (played by Colin Firth) who she has immediate chemistry with, April and Bernice trying to figure out how to relate to each other.

Hunt, as the director, handles it deftly and does not try to over-smooth it.  The characters are raw and awkward sometimes, don't have answers or solutions, and make mistakes.  Ultimately, the humanity of the movie prevents it from seeming like a made for TV movie.  Well worth a watch.",1286409600,,832,4.9352517985611515

While the book had a genuine plot and continuity, this movie, in my humble opinion, did not.  While the Bette Midler character in the book played a central role, in the movie, she seemed an afterthought.  While Mr. Firth provided a pretty face, his movie character was more important than it should have been.  Ms. Hunt's character should not have been married and Mr. Broderick's character was totally superfluous.

Bette Midler is wonderful, as always, but the entire cast rises to the occasion to portray characters that make you laugh and make you feel the depth of the emotion within this great story.

He takes you into Franks head and your heart breaks for him when he sees April has cheated on him.  Every movie I see him in I am amazed all over again how he can take you on such a ride as any character he is playing.

Helen Hunt great job on your directorial debut.

What I could not understand was the adoption at the end.  Here you have two beautiful very young children starved for a mothers love - why wouldn't you surround Jimmy Ray and Ruby with all the love you have and continue to try to have a child with beautiful Frank??  This new addition to the family will take attention away from two already needy children.

I still watch the movie at least once a week because Helen Hunt, Bette Medler, Colin Firth, and Freddie are so great in their roles.  Matthew Broderick does a great job as the man child.  But the end just always upsets me.

3491078,4,B001BEK86K,"Mr. Uyeshima's review provides a wonderful and accurate description of this film. I have little to add, but do recommend Then She Found Me, if the viewer understands that this is not a mainstream Hollywood romance. Those seeking yet another reprisal of a Colin Firth as Darcy to a modern day Elizabeth Bennett treatment probably will be disappointed. The film has many layers, with a primary focus on betrayal, not just formulaic romantic love. I read some complaints that reviewers didn't find the characters likable and found Ms. Hunt not glamorous enough. One of the things I enjoyed most was more realistic, complex portrayal of human foibles than we're often given in film today. I laughed when I read the comments about Ms. Hunt's appearance, because this basically is what you look like when it all comes crashing down around you. You can relate to these characters. They are quite imperfectly human.

I like it. This is a film for adults, which is a such rarity these days. There is a lot of heart to the story and its characters. Lots of lovely subtleties in scenery, music, costuming, etc. The cast is superb, comedy is generally smartly written and well delivered. Formulaic aspects to some story lines, but it was thought-provoking overall, and well worth viewing.

I'm a fan of Helen Hunt as an actress and am proud to see such a strong directorial debut. I hope she continues. I really recommend checking out the Special Features section of the DVD, especially the interviews and featurette. Those interested in film making will enjoy Ms. Hunt's commentary, much of which focuses on the creative detail of telling the story, especially with little budget and limited time.

I think this film deserved more of a chance than it got. It's not a ""chick flick,"" fluffy romance or Lifetime movie. It's an adult comedy-drama with a thought-provoking theme and wonderful performances. Not a perfect film, by any means, but better in its genre than I've seen in awhile.",1249257600,,1974,4.886567164179104
3491079,5,B001BEK86K,"This movie is way above the category of ""entertainment"" though it has some entertaining moments. Without spoiling the story it is about betrayals, both real and imputed, both small and cosmic, and a way to step beyond living in anger, fear, and self doubt. It was written and produced on a minimal budget by Helen Hunt. Her writing and re-writing of the screenplay took nearly ten years. This should not be taken as an indication of Hunt being a poor writer, but quite the reverse. It  some ways the screen play was over-written particularly relative to a popular audience. It is a rich example of psychological literature done as a film. It is in essence a version of the Rapunzel story, the adult version not the trite nonsense usually offered to children. Firth plays in effect the blinded Prince. It is one of the very, very few contexts that address the prevalence of the puerella pattern of behavior, beyond the more familiar As Helen described the process in the features she took the lead role, just because it was an easier thing to do than to explain what she wanted from another actor. As an actor and producer and director she does an outstanding job with a difficult story. The richness of the roles performed by both Bette Midler and Colin Firth are also well above average. This film deserves the widest exposure possible. She deserves the resources to direct and produce a much more expansive movie, but will not likely get it due to profitability of entertaining us to death and to stupor. It addresses the rites of passage of both the puer and the puella, and those who embrace the transition and those that hide from it. After watching it I was in a daze thinking about its segments for several days, and then I had to watch it again, and then again. The title has potentially multiple references. Her re-interpretation of the old Jewish teaching story which frames the story is also amazing. This is a rare movie and deserves to be used in social psychology and social problems classes as required viewing. It will also strike you at your core and possibly change your life. I regret that anyone would presume to rate this work as solely a piece of entertainment or visual narcotic. First and foremost it is raw pathos of the highest level. It will make you uncomfortable, and that is a very, good thing.",1247702400,,2324,4.654501216545012

He seems very relaxed in the role - as if he is having quite a bit of fun (although I find it hard to believe Ms. Hunt's character could have ever been ""torn"" between Firth and Matthew Broderick. That was a bit beyond my ability to ""suspend disbelief"";) Salman Rushdie as the gynocologist was an inspired bit of fun;) And finally, Ms. Hunt - please eat something.

Helen Hunt who plays April Ebner I am afraid to say looked drab and depressing. The film also just trotted out the old cliche of ""panicking woman with biological clock ticking"" format. The scenes with Colin Firth are dull and the conversation is stilted and it was a bit cringy watching. I read that many feminists are lauding this as an excellent portrayal of motherhood but I disagree. There seems to be, in April's desperate attempts at motherhood, very little airplay for ethical issues such as the child's right to having a father. There is no mention of this just the ""I want a baby!"" cry from April. The panicking was depressing. I felt actually a bit down after this movie because I think there are many women out there who are happily producing children in their late thirties and into their forties. The boundaries are being pushed constantly and yet here is a film that just uses the panicked woman as its protagonist.

Bette Midler did a great job of reigning herself in and every other actor is just as great. This film is a great accomplishment for Helen Hunt, who starred in and directed (her debut) this movie.

It tells the story of a 39 y.o. woman (April) whose sole focus is to have a child before it is too late. As she herself is adopted, she desperately wants to have a child of her own. As in real life, things do not go exactly as planned. This film was fun to watch despite the kleenex staged moments.

The thing that struck me the most was the ending. As an adopted child, April was determined to have her own flesh and blood and adoption was not an option. She felt that there was a difference between herself and her mother versus her mother and her biological child. The resolution was a beautiful sight to behold. We learn so much more about our own parents when we become parents ourselves, no matter how we get there.

Its widest release was a paltry 153 theaters.  Box office receipts fell just short of $4 million domestically.  The worldwide tally was right on $8m according to Box Office Mojo.

The reason?  Like others on these pages have noted, of the four main characters only Bette Midler was likable.  Delightfully so.  I spent the time The Divine Miss M was off-screen waiting for her to return.  Helen Hunt looks tired and determinedly unhappy.  Matthew Broderick is odd, nebbish (and chunky to boot).  Colin Firth's character keeps an explosive temper barely under wraps.  I realize these are the roles they're playing, but the result is that you're hard-pressed to root for any of these three.

However, my kudos to Ms. Hunt for the awesome stunt-casting of Salman Rushdie as a gynecologist.  That rocked.  I felt like I was in on a nice inside joke there.

Why are they not together? Whatever happened to Matthew Broderick? Is Bette Midler still involved in Helen Hunt's life, or on they on the outs again? How difficult was it to obtain this chinese kid?) This was really disorienting, with no cues as to how much time had passed between scenes (months? years?) I was hoping to find these scenes in the bonus features, but instead there is just a long series of boring interviews where the actors drone on and on about how wonderful they all are. Skip those!
This movie is really different than the book, where the focus is on how the bio mom is a chronic liar. The focus in this movie is how you can't trust anybody, giving the film a pessimistic tone.
No happy ending, unless you're rooting for chinese orphans. Why would a deeply religious Jewish character adopt one?
Salman Rushdie was surprisingly good. Bette Midler played a caricature of herself. Matthew Broderick seemed to be sleepwalking. Helen Hunt seemed emaciated and fatigued. Colin Firth was an old curmudgeon (he's much better in the Bridget Jones movies!).",1234051200,,1387,4.619433198380567

In the next scene a few months later, the bride's mother is dying in the hospital but still berating her adopted daughter for not having children. In the next scene, the groom played by Matthew Broderick admits having an affair; the next scene, the mother dies; the next, a woman shows up claiming to be the bride's birth mother; the next, the bride played by Helen Hunt, an elementary school teacher, sees the father of one of her students (Colin Firth) and it's LOVE at first sight; the next, she's sleeping with him (with his two small kids in the house); the next, she's pregnant; the next, she's making out with Broderick in a car in the middle of the street in broad daylight; the next, Firth is pissed; the next, she discovers the birth mother (Better Midler) lied to her; the next, she discovers she really is the birth mother; the next, she's having a miscarriage --- and so it goes, on and on, one stupid thing after another in this incoherent, unfunny, unwitty, uninsightful and often yucky movie. (I'm giving it two stars because I reserve one star for the really godawful howlers that I can't even watch to the end).
Here, none of the characters are convincing. Firth does his usual Mr. Darcy thing but seems to have the mind of a 14-year-old in the body of a late 40-something. Midler has the mind of a 12-year-old in the body of a late 60-something. Broderick, the mind of a 10-year old etc etc...
One good thing: Helen Hunt seems to be allowing herself to age naturally instead of doing the Hollywood botox thing. One bad thing: the various Jewish bits interspersed here for no good reason and without reverence for the reality of Judaism.

First of all, Helen Hunt looks way too old in the movie even to be playing a person who is almost too old to have a baby. She is really in her mid 40s and was playing someone who was supposed to be 39, but she looked more like 50. Second, the intitial interaction between April and her biological mother doesn't seem very believable. Third, the Broderick chataceter doesn't seem very believeable as a teacher. He doesn't seem like a teacher and apparently just walks off the job to go live with his mom. Fourth, April seems like she doesn't go to work very much for a teacher. After the first few scenes in the movie, she seems to be everywhere but school during the day. Fifth, the relationship between April and the father of her student seems a little quick and odd. Finally, April's desire to have a kid of her own at almost all costs seems a little unbelievable.

Each one of the characters - Hunt (a 39 year old childless women who was dumped by her husband but who still longs for a biological child of her own), Firth (a divorced father of two young children who is still recovering from his failed marriage), Broderick (an immature ex-husband who does not know what he wants), and Midler (a local celebrity who is doing all she can to gain the acceptance and love of her daughter whom she had abandoned during infancy) are flawed in their own ways.  Yet, I can empathize with each one of them and find them all likable.  The plot is different and in my opinion richer and better and more realistic than that of the typical Hollywood comedy.  What makes this a good movie is that I do care what happens to each of the characters!  The bittersweet situations in the movie were just the icing on the cake.",1226966400,,940,4.410404624277457

It has now been replaced by the more realistic and they lived `somewhat content for the time being'. Yes, in my estimation the film is indeed that cynical and pessimistic. This assumption on my part is further supported by the Jewish joke told at the beginning and end of the movie. It's about a trusting child being told by his Father to jump off a high step only to be allowed to fall instead of being caught by his Dad as promised. What's the lesson? I guess it's something like even the ones you love the most will let you down, or worse, don't trust anyone.

Needless to say I didn't enjoy this film despite the presence of the usually charming Colin Firth and the always vulnerable, girl-next-door Helen Hunt.  On the positive side there are some unexpectedly unique twists and turns in both storyline and dialogue but it's not enough to save this overall dismal film.

Helen Hunt did a wonderful job in her role as the main character, April (and as director). She really knows how to deliver her lines and pace her reactions. I am not at the baby fever stage yet of my life, but she drew me into her character's baby drama. I felt for her and cried when she cried. This was a very touching story.

It had a cast of actors that I normally enjoy but the way they were cast and the dialogue they were given made me dislike their on-screen characters.  Hunt herself looks practically elderly and she is supposed to be an attractive 39 year old.  Broderick is as whiny and creepy as everything I've seen him in lately.  Colin Firth was erratic and outright ugly most of the time as if they told him to just act as angry and frazzled as possible.  The actors only flesh out their roles briefly here and there and are cardboard cutouts most of the time - especially Helen in the lead role.  Only Bett Midler's character had any actual life and energy in her.  She brought some fresh air, even some heart, to her scenes but it wasn't enough to cast off the gray that hung over this film.  If you want to see what it looks like to have life dump on shallow people then watch this film.  If you want to see a strong character push through the challenges of life and rise above their circumstances you may be, like me, disappointed.

3491112,2,B001BEK86K,"Ok,  I tried.  I really,  really tried not to compare the movie with the book.  I loved the book,  a tender, poignant journey of love in which April,  albeit unwillingly, learns to accept the difficult person who gave birth to her and slowly learns the devastating truth of her past.  But Elinor Lipman says she does not mind the fact that Helen Hunt basically took her book and scissored away everything but a few names and the center plot of the book,  and came up with this idiotic film about ticking biological clocks instead.

But I have to wonder,  how can she not mind?  This hash of a movie bears little resemblance to what it was based on,  so why did Helen Hunt not just find someone to write a new screenplay about a woman who wanted to have a baby?  Why did she take a brilliant story,  with fabulous characters,  and turn it into this really rather dumb movie?

In the book,  Bernice is difficult but ultimately complex and suprisingly sympathetic by the end,  but Bette Midler's Bernice is just a cardboard cutout of the same person.  And it's a shame,  because Midler would have played the ""real"" Bernice beautifully if she had had a decent script to work with.  And in the book,  April is a bit uptight,  but not the brittle, haggard neurotic that is portrayed here.  And while Colin Firth is, as usual,  great to look at,  his character is poorly written as well.  The male ""hero"" of the book,  Dwight,  and his relationship with April,  are so appealing,  that I cannot believe these two annoying men and their shallow interactions with the main character are supposed to replace that.

I did give this movie two stars because I liked Salman Rushdie playing the part of the doctor and I liked the sweet little twist at the end.  But the whole time I watched it,  I couldn't help thinking of the wonderful book at home on my shelf and asking,  ""Why,  oh why,  did someone have to screw it up so very badly?""",1224720000,,1924,4.4409221902017295
3491113,3,B001BEK86K,"You would think that with Helen Hunt, Bette Midler, Colin Firth and Matthew Broderick you would have a hit comedy...guess again. I love all of these actors and actresses separately; but together in this movie, I have to say that it left me a little cold.  I asked myself how this could be and I think that a major problem was casting; I just could not believe Matthew Broderick acting in that way towards Helen Hunt (unless he was still playing Ferris Bueller as one poster humorously pointed out); Colin Firth in this part was not believable and Bette Midler certainly did not come across as Mom.

I think Helen Hunt saved the day.  April Epner (Hunt) is thrown into a tizzy when her child husband (Ben) abandons her and moves back with his own Mom.  Hunt is left to find her own way; along that trail she meets Colin Firth (one of her student's fathers) and encounters or is more accosted by Bette Midler who we come to find out is April's biological mother.  How April loses and finds love and all of the discoveries she makes about her personal relationships never quite amount to the self discovery she makes about herself and what she wants out of life and what she wants from herself and others.

The cast is great; but for me there was a big something missing.  It was quite simply an unexpected let down.  But for those staying in on a rainly afternoon, this is a movie which may help you pass the time (if you are for example in the woods without any transportation and cannot find anything else to do).

Not an awful film; but not a great one either - 3 stars

Don't recall that in the book. Wonderful!)  In the book, if I recall, Midler's part was 'over the top' but this actress was nicely restrained to suit the movie's mood, the love interest in the book, again, if I recall was homely, (Fred Gwynne came to mind when I read it) but Firth's more fun to look at than Mr. Munster and in this movie he's closer to his Fever Pitch character than the stuff upper class Brit one..... indeed, this movie shows a different side of him. I actually purchased this as soon as it was out on CD because a friend had seen the movie in the cinema and remarked on Firth's different turn.

When you incorporate everything on the DVD, including the commentary and interviews, I felt like the entire experience of ""Then She Found Me"" was more like watching a documentary on the talented actor, director, and artist.  On this basis, I gladly awarded five stars, which I will expain in a minute.

Limiting my commentary to just the footage, I would have awarded four stars, taking one away for how things occasionally jumped ahead way too fast, for example, when Colin's character and Helen's character first meet.  They seem to progress to intimacy almost immediately, which didn't make sense given their personalities.  And we didn't get much (any?) background on him.  Another example is at the end, when the film takes a huge leap forward without allowing the viewer to participate.  I felt like we lost what could have been a solid 20 minutes of quality character development and lovely compromise.  Instead, we have to guess how these two very likable characters arrived at the most important decisions of the film.

I felt like this experience was really referendum on Helen Hunt, the actor, the ambitious artist, and the graceful storyteller.  First the actor.  I'm sure Hollywood has amazing technology to improve someone's appearance.  OK fine.  To this 40ish reviewer, Ms. Hunt looked amazing, and like most beautiful women, she looked her best whenever she was exceedingly happy (several moments), and whenever she was very unhappy (most of the balance of the movie).

The unhappiness seemed to dominate, for example when men (or birth mothers) were letting her down, and when the lonliness seemed too much to bear.  At these times, her appearance was striking.  When Helen takes yet another deep breath or heavy sigh in weary resignation, its as if she's carrying the woes of the world on her shoulders.  It makes you want to reach through the screen and give her a hug.

The ambitious artist - if there is any message on the DVD extras its that Helen Hunt worked long and hard financially, artistically, persuasively, and courageously to make this project a reality.  Hollywood is becoming so ""big budget/same old thing,"" I can imagine all of the stereotypes she had to overcome to get this film completed.

Finally, graceful story teller.  There were alot of little things making this story very endearing.  I liked the script and the camera work, and I thought the three other lead actors did a wonderful job projecting their personalities into their characters.

The alert viewer will recognize the song ""Naked As We Came,"" from Iron and Wine's ""Our Endless Numbered Days"" album.  Its a beautiful selection if not because it fits in with the movie (until perhaps the end), but because... well its just such a wonderful song!

Her cast shares in the very sentimental story of Hunt's devotion and seemingly endless charisma and abilities. The explanation for making this budget film are in many ways more successful than the film, a work the cast seems determined to classify as a comedy but a work that is far more a human drama.

April Epner (Helen Hunt) is married to fellow schoolteacher Ben Green (Matthew Broderick) and longs to have a baby before her advancing age prevents her dream.  April was adopted as an infant by a Jewish couple who subsequently gave birth to April's brother Freddy (Ben Shenkman): April has always longed to have been Freddy's biological equal, wondering what it would feel like NOT to be adopted.  April's busy life implodes: Ben has decided he doesn't like his life and leaves April, April's mother dies, April meets Frank (Colin Firth) a recently divorced writer and father of two children,  and April is contacted by a man who can put April in touch with her birth mother - popular TV talk show hostess Bernice Graves (Bette Midler). And if these turns of events weren't traumatic enough, April discovers that she has become pregnant by Ben and Ben is unsure whether he can handle the restructuring of his life to accommodate April.  Cautiously April and Frank begin a rather tenuous courtship which is almost immediately threatened by April's discovery of her pregnant state.  April and Bernice meet, exchange backgrounds, and make pacts to test their biologic relationship.  How each of these characters makes promises that eventually damage each other and then resolve in unexpected ways becomes a study of the meaning of love and compassion among fragile human beings.

While not a satisfying story on every level and a film too cluttered with inconvenient editing choices, the cast is strong and obviously committed, and the story (neither a comedy or a drama but a mixture of the two) tests credibility.  But there are some fine moments and the lessons in human behavior are worth examining.  Not a great movie but a strong little small budget film.

3491128,1,B001BEK86K,"I am not sure what Helen Hunt was thinking here, but this movie is a total waste of time. It's also a total waste of Colin Firth's talent. Ms. Hunt looks terrible in this film and I am not sure if that is the way her character is supposed to look. Even with a little bit of make-up on, she looks very tired. The dialogue is snappy and at times funny and that is partly due to Bette Midler's comedic talents. Both, she and Colin Firth, save the film in some of the scenes. Matthew Broderick looks like he is being forced to act. The story and how it evolves is choppy at best and does not have a consistency to it that could have saved the film on some level. Helen Hunt is a terrific actress and should stick to acting because directing and acting at the same is distracting. And it shows.",1220140800,,789,4.12987012987013
3491129,4,B001BEK86K,"Released earlier this year,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Baby-Mama/dp/B0014E646U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Baby Mama</a>&nbsp;covers the same emotional territory but in much broader slapstick terms, while this 2008 serio-comedy is driven far more by character than situation. In this case, the protagonist is 39-year-old April Epner, a New York kindergarten teacher who was raised in a close-knit Jewish family and desperately wants the biological connection of a birth child before her alarm clock goes off. She marries fellow teacher Ben, an inarticulate schlub with a terminal case of the Peter Pan Syndrome. After a brief time, he wants out of the marriage, and at almost the same time, April's adoptive mother Trudy dies. Not even a month goes by before April's biological mother suddenly shows up in the form of the brazenly overbearing but genuinely likeable Bernice Graves, a cable talk-show hostess who is something of a local media celebrity. If life was not complicated enough, April also finds herself drawn to Frank, the single father of one of her pupils. Unlike Ben, he feels the same about April but is fighting his own bitterness about his own recent divorce.

Not only does Helen Hunt star as April, but she also co-wrote the screenplay with Alice Arlen and Victor Levin and makes her big-screen directorial debut. Granted she's more impressive as an actress than a filmmaker, but as a director and writer, she makes the most of a storyline that stacks the deck a bit like a Lifetime TV-movie. There are enough realistic surprises that take the plot off the rails in a good way. Looking gaunt and avoiding much make-up, Hunt is really playing a variation of the beaten-down waitress she played in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/As-Good-As-It-Gets/dp/0767811100/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">As Good As It Gets</a>, as she carries that same constantly pained expression of disappointment and looks about to explode during moments of emotional duress. However, a decade later, Hunt inhabits the character more naturalistically this time and with a deeper sense of vulnerability and haggard exhaustion. Perhaps to minimize any unnecessary dramatic risk, Hunt cast the other principal roles with actors playing familiar parts. Matthew Broderick effectively portrays Ben as the perpetually dazed man-child he is, while perennial love interest Colin Firth gives texture to the seemingly ideal suitor Frank, especially as he edges toward the breaking point in tolerating the sum of April's foibles.

In one of her increasingly rare screen appearances, Bette Midler gives a scene-stealing performance as Bernice. She lights up the movie with the character's unfettered sense of abandonment while gradually exposing the secrets that threaten to undermine her newly found relationship with her daughter. Other parts are played with minimum fuss - Ben Shenkman as April's physician brother Freddy feeling put-upon for having a biological tie to their mother, and Salman Rushdie (yes, the controversial author of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Satanic-Verses/dp/0812976711/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Satanic Verses</a>&nbsp;which brought him a death sentence from the Ayatollah Khomeini in 1989) as April's doctor. Hunt provides the principal actors, especially herself, plenty of good, meaty scenes with opportunities for bravura moments, and they do deliver. It just doesn't quite come together as a whole by the end, and that may be that Hunt is so used to the sitcom format of the long-running series,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mad-About-You/dp/B0006SGYLU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mad About You</a>. The incomplete result is that some laughs feel a bit contrived, some scene transitions seem jarring, and some expected character revelations are given short shrift. Nonetheless, the dramatic developments toward the end carry the emotional impact necessary to make the movie truly affecting, and Hunt should be given full credit for a most auspicious debut as a filmmaker.",1218067200,,4172,6.021885521885522
3491130,4,B001BEK86K,"This film is a promising directorial debut for Helen Hunt.  While I found some of the editing to be awkward or sub-par, and dialog to be a bit stilted here and there; the overall film is quite good, and has many layers of meaning and sub-texts to explore.

The title of the film is a good place to start: ""Then She Found Me"".  Who found whom?  Was it Helen Hunt's Character (April Epner) finding a new life companion after her husband leaves?  Her birth mother (played with panache and humor by Bette Midler) finding April after April's adoptive mother dies?  April finding herself?  Or (to avoid spoilers) April finding something else?  Even her character's name implies a new birth and new beginnings...

The answer to the question is ""all of the above""...

The film is, in many ways, about discovery: discovery of what is (and isn't) real, what is truth, what has value, and what it means to be family.

Helen's character works through all of these issues in this film with sensitivity, mild humor, and a performance that exposes April's vulnerability at many different levels as she searches for answers.

I find the portayals of Jewish family life (which is a major component of the framework of the story) to be very well done (no surprise, given that much of the cast is Jewish).

Of particular interest is the performance of Salman Rushdie (the author of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Satanic-Verses-A-Novel/dp/0812976711/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Satanic Verses: A Novel</a>, for which an Islamic Fatwa was issued, calling for his death) as her Gynecologist.  While not a professional actor, his presence is a reminder that we're dealing with very human challenges here.  Issues that we all face at some point in our lives, regardless of race, religion, or creed.  Of particular interest in this vein is the scene where April (as a Jew), her birth mother (as a Catholic) and the Doctor all join together in prayer after April confesses she is angry with God.

One cannot neglect to mention Colin Firth's superb performance here as April's romantic interest. The trauma they each undergo as their relationship grows is fascinating, though I found myself squirming in my seat watching it!

Although the desire for a child is the central goal of April's character, this film is definitely not meant for children to watch.  There are a number of reasonably explicit adult situations.  Partial nudity - even though tastfully done - is frequent.

""Then She Found Me"" has won awards at some Film Festivals, but, though full of promise of greater things to come from Helen Hunt, it is a bit rough around the edges, and too controversial and explicit in some of its subject matter to be in the running for a major award.  Even so, I thoroughly enjoyed the film.

I rate this film as a four star performance: an excellent script and excellent performances, despite a few flaws here and there.

Definitely recommended as a ""must see"" if you and your better half prefer romantic comedies that are more than mindless fluff.  ...Just be sure to put the kids to bed first!",1217203200,,3120,4.976833976833976
3491131,5,B001BEK86K,"This was an impressive movie. Independent, yes. Full of surprises, yes. Helen Hunt directed the movie as well as starred in it. I have always admired her as an actress ever since as good as it gets with jack nicholson. This is a movie about a woman getting older that wants a child. She gets married in the beginning, and then her husband decides he isn't ready for the pressure. He knows she wants a baby, but he isn't sure he is ready for the responsibility.

Depressed and alone, she finds solace in a divorced father of two who is semi-angry, semi-depressed, and in a way, ready to move on. She ignores his advances at first, but finally realizes it is time to move on from the husband she believed to be the one.

I love Colin Firth in this movie, he has an excellent display of passion and anger at each event that happens to him. He seems to be a mate of challenge for our heroine, but at the same time the potential for a better future.

Bette Midler was also equally superb. She played the crazy, sometimes destructive liar pretty well. She is very self centered, and changes the subject frequently, but you cannot help but resist her.

Excellent from all angles, a must see. It is too bad it was dubbed an independent piece, as not everyone knows about it. We have an independent theater that just shows these types of films. I will be buying it, but it is definitly worth a watch over and over again.",1216598400,,1411,4.374045801526718
3491132,3,B001BEK86K,"In the beginning of this film, based on Elinor Lipman's novel of the same title, April (Hunt) and Ben (Broderick) are getting married.  The very next scene is Ben leaving to return to his overprotective Jewish mother.

Next April, who met Ben teaching classes across the hall from him, discovers that Ben quit his job and she's stuck with his classes as well.  That's when she meets Frank (Colin Firth) the divorced parent of one of her kids.  Frank wants to see April, but he's too hurt by his own life to make that commitment.

Just when you think things are complicated enough for April, enter Bernice (Midler) a talk show hostess who claims to be April's Mom. When April finds that Bernice isn't quite truthful, she offers the woman one more challenge to stay in her life--help me get the baby I want.

The story's heartfelt, but I think it's probably ""Lifetime"" or movie-of-the-week material rather than the big screen.  Hunt, Firth, and Midler are in top form, but Broderick just doesn't quite cut it.

One warning:  bring a hankie or three.  This is another one of those Midler films you're going to cry through.

3491133,3,B001BEK86K,"An unusual story that ends a bit too cinematically (i.e., perfectly) for real life. It's a very niche film with a very small audience who can truly relate to it and understand it. The movie does make for a good directorial debut for Helen Hunt and the cast is pretty decent. Still, it's hard to truly recommend this film based on its lack of sweetness and overall lack of true heart.",1212710400,,383,4.408450704225352
3491134,4,B001BEK86K,"Helen Hunt's first motion picture directorial outing is an imperfect but emotionally satisfying work.  I can't think of a recent romantic comedy that even comes close to the honesty of the feelings portrayed here.

This is not one of those movies that throw the characters into unreal situations where they then proceed to act as no on in real life would act.  The scene in which Ben breaks up with April (I'm not giving anything away -- it's in the trailer) is so genuine in the way it shows April reaching out to Ben for comfort even as he's breaking her heart.  It takes a mature storyteller and two excellent actors (Hunt and Broderick) to get that right.  Colin Firth is pitch-perfect as April's other love interest.  Bette Midler has a few ""Divine Miss M"" moments, where she is clearly ""performing"" (i.e., delivering lines as ""lines"" rather than as credibly spontaneous dialog) but even those moments work since it is consistent with her talk-show-host character who is so used to being ""on.""  Ben Shenkman is superb.  Even Salman Rushdie's odd appearance works.

As a 40-something year old woman, I have watched with some dismay as more and more movies and TV shows focus on the purported need of mature women to have biological children, often dismissing adoption as an equally-rewarding choice.  Although this film starts there, it goes in far more interesting directions with a delightfully surprising ending.

My only quibble with the film is that the time frames seem off, suggesting some careless editing, perhaps?  April frequently comments on how much time has passed from one event to another and. frankly, it doesn't add up in a coherent way.",1210809600,,1659,4.885714285714286
