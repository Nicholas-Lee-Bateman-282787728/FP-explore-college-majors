8635957,1,B00HUQC20I,"Warrior Assassin was obviously not produced as a feature film. It appears to have been edited from the multi-episode three-part series, Legend of Shaolin Kung Fu, produced by HNTV. Either part of that series could never coherently fit into an hour-and-a-half movie. And, yes, Yuen Biao is one of the stars of the series, as is Leung Kar-yan and Ji Chunhua. I'd be curious to see it as it was meant to be seen. The one star rating is for Lionsgate's ill treatment.",1428364800,,463,4.590361445783133

8635959,1,B00HUQC20I,"Anyone giving this more than 1-2 stars is lying to you or is someone from the film company. First off, everything on the front and back cover of this movie is a lie. The characters don't exist in the movie, there is not one samurai sword in the whole movie, the story explanation on the back cover doesn't describe the ""actual' movie that you get inside. It's like I just got trolled by a movie company. ""hey, heres a crazy awesome movie about martial arts that looks like modern times and theres samurai sword fighting happening"".... when you pop it in, you get 1970's martial arts with the sound effects and floppy weapons that are obviously fake. There are a couple fight scenes that are cool but its overall cheesey. I don't recommend this movie. Don't be fooled by the cover or description of this movie",1404518400,,808,4.541095890410959
8635960,1,B00HUQC20I,"The consequences of the low budget are clearly shown on the quality of the fighting scenes, and the acting.

The fighting look fakes and laughable.
The acting is not convincing. Try some popular movies staring Jet Li and you will see the difference.
There was only one thing that provoked my curiosity in the first 10 minutes. It was the question ""Why did the father treat his son that way?"". It turned out to be a good twist but it was completely ruined by bad acting. It's like a bad joke.

Save your time and money on this one.",1403654400,2,530,4.343434343434343
8635961,5,B00HUQC20I,I like martial art and sword type movies decent for what I expected from the purchase. violence is fun just be aware that it is not a kids movie,1403654400,,144,4.0
8635962,5,B00HUQC20I,5 Stars as a marshal artist my self I all way take to the art in film I won't tell the ending but once one takes the path of war sorrow always follows,1399334400,,150,3.5757575757575757
8635963,2,B00HUQC20I,"I also found the movie boring, strange because the fight scenes were ok., but i think the acting was poor. We all realize most Asian movies are based on revenge, but still.",1398124800,,172,4.40625
8635964,2,B00HUQC20I,"A young man vows to avenge the death of his father, and few other people who get killed along the way. He teams up with one army then ends up in the army he is battling...

In spite of all the fighting, the film bored me. The first thing you will notice in the 1970s style dubbing. The voices were terrible and the ""whack-whack"" every time two body parts hit is old and silly...but I guess it has to be there because it has always been there.

Some minor anti-gravity fighting and 9 minutes from the end our hero who is a master fighter is training in a different fight form. One guy fights with a half dozen arrows through his lungs. In one chase scene it suddenly goes from night to day. A person gets shot in the back with an arrow and then has dried blood at the mouth. Three guys fight an army...one fighter at a time. You get the idea.

This film is a throw back. 2 stars is generous.",1397260800,3,890,4.103448275862069
