6790886,5,B00P8RUNO8,"""Twilight of Honor"" (1963) is another of the pleasures of watching films directed by Boris Sagal (""Made in Paris,"" ""Girl Happy"" and ""The Omega Man"") and was the motion picture debut of Richard Chamberlain and Joey Heatherton, who won a Golden Globe that year as Best New Star or some such.  Actually, I thought she over did it, as usual, come to think of later efforts.  Also in the cast are Claude Rains, Joan Blackman, Jeanette Nolan, but it is Nick Adams who delivers the most affecting performance and he won an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor, while the film garnered also a nomination for Art Direction.  Based on a novel by Al Dewlen and the screenplay by Henry Denker is excellent.  Cinematography is also excellent by Phillip Lathrop and the music is by John Green.  Filmed in glorious black and white, the courtroom drama is highly unusual and well told.  Chamberlain is a but rigid, but he is a deserved star.  Nick Adams should have won the Academy Award.  He makes a truly vivid and memorable character and he had been doing that for quite a while (notably ""Sing, Boy, Sing"" (1958)).  He was a very good actor and should have been rewarded before his untimely death in 1968.  That might not have happened.  This Warner Archive presentation contains a trailer and is a very good transfer.  Unfortunately, we had to wait so long for it.",1421193600,6,1366,4.669456066945607
6790887,4,B00P8RUNO8,Yes they don't make movies like this anymore.. It is not 1963 times have changed and so have we. If you were not around in 1963 the movie  might seem dated and slow. In my opinion that's part of its charm. It is a court room drama that requires you to pay attention. No car crashes and shoot 'em ups. Just glorious black and white photography and  plenty of melodrama. At times the movie borders on camp but that's what pasted for high drama in that era . Besides who would pass up seeing Joey Heatherton play a bad girl heart throb!,1419811200,6,533,4.215686274509804

8686949,3,B00P8RUNO8,"This movie is definitely dated. Gender portrayal is especially painful, but it is a realistic view of the values at the time, so should be viewed with that in mind. I found the storyline rather plodding, though ultimately surprising. I read the book (also not a spell-binder), otherwise I think I would have found even less of interest and probably would have lost the salient points of the courtroom proceedings altogether. For some reason, all the names are changed from the book, and the state where the action takes place is changed, but the rest is fairly true to it, though somewhat condensed, as you would expect. That the defendant committed the murder is never in question. Richard Chamberlain is the very reluctant defense attorney. He finds, in the amazing state laws of the time, a glimmer of hope for his client, although it was rather unsavory to this viewer (back to the painful sexism of the time).  I have been watching reruns of the old TV show ""Dr. Kildare"", and though they are also quite dated, I am finding them charming. Chamberlain is bringing back memories of my teenage crush on him and each episode provides at least one scene or line or character that sparks a 50-year-old memory quite surprisingly and fondly. This is the reason I got this particular DVD movie, which was made in the same time period. But ""Twilight of Honor''s Chamberlain's character has less charm. He faces a moral dilemma, he has an older mentor, he struggles to do what he thinks is right -- all very reminiscent of Dr. Kildare, but somehow less memorable. I realize I DID see this movie when it was originally in the theater, but had forgotten about it.

An additional comment: The DVD I received was defective. The trailer was fine but the movie itself was missing. I had to send it back at my own expense, and after over a month have still not received any communication from the seller, nor any refund. The DVD movie I have reviewed was purchased elsewhere and I have not subtracted any stars due to the poor quality or service of the seller.",1490054400,,2047,4.651933701657459
8686950,2,B00P8RUNO8,"A much lesser Anatomy of a Murder courtroom drama. Claude Rains is good but the rest of the cast is mixed at best. What was Nick Adams thinking when he campaigned to get himself an Oscar. TOH comes off like a television movie, even a pilot for a series and one that just doesn't stand out.",1488499200,,289,4.178571428571429
8686951,5,B00P8RUNO8,"Great sound and pic and great movie... However, it was strange seeing Chamberlain playing a lawyer, after seeing him as a Intern/Resident in Dr. Kildare although those years... He did not do a bad job, but I think the stero type of the Kildare role impacted him for this movie.....",1483056000,,281,4.64
8686952,4,B00P8RUNO8,"NOTE: ""Twilight of Honor"" is available on Warner Archive DVD-R discs, and the black-and-white picture on my copy was inexplicably darker than it should have been in a couple of early scenes (resulting in an effect much like an adjustable overhead light dimming and brightening). I don't know if this was a problem with my individual disc or the master print used to transfer the film, but after the first 20 minutes or so, the brightness levels were normal for the rest of the film.

Watching vintage movies can be as enlightening for what the films reveal to today's audiences about the era in which they were made as for the dramatic value of the movies themselves. Such is the case with ""Twilight of Honor,"" a 1963 courtroom melodrama that provides a good look at both the criminal justice system and the changing sexual attitudes of that era. And, despite a rather weak ending, it's also a pretty entertaining movie to boot.

Richard Chamberlain stars in ""Twilight"" as David Mitchell, an idealistic young attorney still trying to come to grips with the death of his wife a couple of years earlier. Despite his not having tried a criminal case since his wife's death, the judge appoints him to defend Ben Brown (Nick Adams), a drifter accused of killing a very popular local rancher. The case seems open and shut; the rancher was traveling on business and picked up Brown and his wife Laura Mae (Joey Heatherton in her film debut) while hitchhiking, and then Brown beat the man to death in an attempted robbery. The police even have two separate confessions by Brown. The small New Mexico town has been whipped into a lynch mob frenzy, and the special prosecutor (James Gregory) wants to use the case to jump start his political career. The only people in Mitchell's corner are Art Harper (Claude Rains), Mitchell's mentor, who is now too ill to handle the case himself, and Harper's daughter (Joan Blackman), who has long been in love with Mitchell.

""Twilight of Honor"" is not a Perry Mason-style whodunit, but rather a poor man's version of the far superior ""Anatomy of a Murder."" There's no question that Brown killed the rancher, but Mitchell bases his defense on an obscure New Mexico law that says a husband has a right to kill a man he catches committing adultery with his wife. The defendant's version of events is that, after the rancher put the couple and himself up for the night, Brown walked into the next room and found his wife and the rancher in bed. In fact, he didn't even hit the rancher until the man pulled a gun on him. Since the dead man was practically considered a saint in the community, this defense is going to prove a tough sell with the jury. To make matters worse, Laura Mae has turned on her husband and is contradicting his story in an effort to get the reward money thats been posted for Browns conviction.

Even with the widespread coverage given to cases like the O.J. Simpson trial, it's tough for modern day audiences to picture the mob mentality that often accompanied sensational trials back then, so Twilight of Honor may be an eye opener in that regard. The extent of a criminal defendant's constitutional rights was slowly evolving in the courts, and the Miranda case was still several years off. Here, despite Mitchell complaining of the prosecutor's dirty tricks, the prosecution releases Brown's confession to the media and conducts interviews brashly proclaiming Brown's guilt. The trial quickly becomes a circus, a development that provides much of the movie's entertainment value.

I was actually a bit surprised at the degree of sexual frankness in ""Twilight of Honor."" While todays audiences will find Twilight somewhat tame, for the era, it was rather risqu&eacute;, as was Anatomy of a Murder a couple of years earlier. The film makes no effort to hide the fact that Laura Mae was a part-time prostitute, mentioning that she had been arrested for ""cohabiting"" with men and even using the words ""prostitute"" and breasts on occasion. And, in one scene before the trial starts, the dead rancher's widow (Jeannette Nolan) admits to Mitchell that her husband had become impotent and tried to prove his virility with other women. The flashback scenes showing the rancher are pretty much those of a middle-aged lech hitting on an all-too-willing young woman as her husband helplessly squirms.

The film does make extensive use of flashbacks as the various characters give their recollection of the events surrounding the rancher's death. That gives director Boris Sagal ample opportunity to showcase the movie's best asset, the luscious Joey Heatherton (who was 18 when the movie was made) doing several quite provocative go-go numbers. The dueling flashbacks also illustrate, ""Rashomon"" style, the differing portrayals of Brown as either an idealistic young man in love with his wife or a brutal thug out for a fast buck.

Richard Chamberlain is decent in the starring role, especially in the quieter scenes, but he lacks the real flair needed for the courtroom theatrics his role requires. The script requires the more experienced prosecutor to push him around in court, but the actor is continually outshined by his co-stars Adams and, especially, Rains. Adams got an Oscar nomination for the role, and he's quite good, but veteran Rains, who was ailing himself when the movie was made (his next-to-last film), easily steals every scene in which he appears.

The ending of ""Twilight of Honor"" is a bit of a disappointment, surprisingly low-key at a time when the audience is expecting something highly flamboyant. In fact, audiences may have a hard time accepting the final result. However, for the most part, the movie is juicy, entertaining melodrama, easily highlighting the difference between what was acceptable at the time for television and for the big screen. And it's also fun to see some familiar television faces like James Gregory and Pat Buttram (Mr. Haney from ""Green Acres"" in a most un-Haney-like performance as the lecherous rancher) in scenery-chewing roles. Overall, for those who enjoy courtroom thrillers, old-time television, or period melodrama, ""Twilight of Honor"" makes its case and easily earns an acquittal,",1467331200,,6187,4.948026948989413

8686954,4,B00P8RUNO8,"From 1963 we have a wonderful movie We have really good performances by Richard Chamberlain, Claude Rains, Nick Adams and Joey Heatherton. Small town troublemaker kills town celebrity and even though everyone wants the killer to hang, there are extenuating circumstances that could clear him but the town is covering it up. The courtroom scenes are seriously claustrophobic and everyone is sitting on top of each other. This is definitely a movie to see as Richard is so young and looks to be one of his first movies. This shows the corruption, not only in small towns but how far up the line it really goes.",1449014400,,608,4.745283018867925
8686955,3,B00P8RUNO8,"Wordy.  Boring.  Stiff acting.  And a predictable plot. Waste of Claude Rains talents in a minor role.  Richard Chamberlain is best suited to TV.  Sorry, but he cannot carry a major motion picture.  Loved the black and white widescreen.  Too bad it wasn't a better movie",1447632000,,270,4.739130434782608
