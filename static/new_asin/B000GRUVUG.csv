8134191,3,B000GRUVUG,If you're looking for unbelievable classic Bluegrass licks then this video is not for you. Johnny Holland is a very good guitarist but this dvd did not live up to my expectations. If you like his Chicken Pickin DVD then you'll probably be unimpressed with this DVD.,1459728000,,265,4.659574468085107

8134193,3,B000GRUVUG,"But I feel I cannot give a higher rating than 3. While the content is organized and well presented, and of course, the playing is impeccable, the actual musical content leaves a lot to be desired for a BLUEGRASS video. And that's the key, since this DVD is intended to teach that genre. I'm not trying to be overly-critical, as I'm actually a big fan of Johnny's country electric playing, but his bluegrass playing is not nearly in the same league as Tony Rice, Clarence White, Dan Crary, Doc Watson, Bryan Sutton, David Grier or Russ Barenberg. He performs on a Guild acoustic that's plugged-in, rather than miked, and honestly, the tone is very piezo-y and unacoustic. It makes listening to his playing a little difficult if you enjoy good tone, (his electric tone is great, however!) As far as musical content, while there is a lot of good stuff here, I'd consider it more, say acoustic country guitar, rather than ""bluegrass."" I normally don't care about genre labels, but in the case of an instructional DVD, I think it can be important. If a beginning bluegrass player, or someone new to this style bought this DVD, I do not think it would provide a good foundation. DVD's by Bryan Sutton, Tony Rice, and Russ Barenberg all are far superior in that respect, and dare I say it, more ""authentic."" On the positive side, Johnny Hiland is a great player, and a good teacher, and I don't want to diminish that. There is a lot of great playing, and good technical instruction on this DVD. But if you're looking to get instruction on BLUEGRASS acoustic flatpicking, I would suggest looking at some of the other options mentioned earlier. I wish Johnny all the best and I'm looking forward to getting his new album, ""All Fired Up!""",1318032000,4,1728,4.650326797385621
