632237,3,6303382347,"Read the book and loved it so I rented the movie.  Was somewhat disappointed that key points were brushed over that I felt were pertinent to the story line, maybe they should have made it a 2 or 3 part movie to get in all the twists and turns.  So, maybe if I didn't read the book I would have liked the movie more, but I did read the books and that's why I rented the movie.  It just really didn't show how the rapture happened and the take-over of the world by the devil (and the description of characters in the book especially with the devil being tall and dark and detailed in his presentation didn't come thru in the movie).  The whole reason they write a book is to give details so we can imagine it better --- then they do these movies and totally overlook the details.  I'm sure I will rent the next movie too and see what happens there.  Just can't take a huge number of books and make it into a ~2 hour movie and get all the details, and that is what really makes these books stand out.",1496620800,,997,4.087179487179487

632239,1,6303382347,"God-awful. The only thing worse than the acting was the creepily effeminate music (I mean the pop songs with the guy singers...it would've been fine if they'd had women singers...inappropriate, maybe, given the context...but with guys it sounded *really* creepy, as in viscerally repelling -- and I'm a woman). Neither the believers nor the non-believers were believable as human, with the exception of the journalist crews. Cameron was the only believer who seemed even remotely psychologically healthy. That pastor did, too, at first but he turned into a drone before long. As to the pilot...he started out a simple jerk and turned into a major creeper.

I've always been a Christian. I don't understand why modern Christian media efforts -- music and movies, especially -- produce so much creepiness and bizarreness. Low budgets do not explain this. It comes down (at least with movies) to the writing. Maybe there's a conspiracy to funnel the limited funds to creeper writers who won't be too realistic... Because good writers aren't willing to twist the truth of the human condition to fit producers' propaganda-level requirements? Or because whoever is funding these things is under some wicked influence to practice cronyism, and somehow only know terrible writers?

The best way to lie is to tell the truth badly...",1495324800,,1323,5.177570093457944

I don't want to critique the actual movie because the message was so good, but I will say the acting is good and events made *extremely* plausible (even if you don't believe in their inevitability or this interpretation of Scripture). There's nothing grand here but the message.

I've loved the book series so long, but didn't for a moment expect a movie(s) to capture the books (what movie ever does?) or inspire in me what the books did. However, I cannot dramatize the fresh and renewed (healthy) fear the books instilled in me, and I admit that I expect the movie to affect me similarly...and it didn't.

632453,5,6303382347,"While I am not a strict Evangelic, for those of us who believe the Bible to be literal, this video is a stark reminder that there will be a Second-Coming of Christ, and our lives should be lived as if that will occur tomorrow.  Because the video is faith-based, the speech/conversation seems stilted.  As a society, we have become so used to swearing and crude, ugly language and actions toward one another, the dialogue and behavior is unbelievably innocent, unfortunately.  Otherwise, the plot is believable, and it is becoming more and more so with each passing day considering the current events in the Mideast and the world's movement toward a one-world government.  I read the book years ago, and the movie brings the key events into a visual ""what if"" focus.  As mentioned, this is a faith-based movie with a suggested audience of pre-teen and up.

632522,4,6303382347,"Released in 2000, Left Behind chronicles events when masses of people all over the earth disappear, leaving only their accouterments behind. Kirk Cameron stars as journalist Buck Williams, a passenger on a plane when the mysterious disappearances occur. Brad Johnson plays the pilot, Janaya Stephens his daughter and Chelsea Noble (Kirks wife) as a hot flight attendant. Gordon Currie co-stars as an up-and-coming world leader, Daniel Pilon as a wealthy banker and Clarence Gilyard Jr. as a left-behind minister. TD Jakes has a good cameo.

Most readers know this, but the story is based on prophetic accounts of end-time events from the Bible. I have studied eschatology (end-times prophecies) and do advocate the pre-Tribulation Rapture based on scriptures like 1 Thessalonians 4:13-18 and Luke 17:24,34-35, which doesnt mean, of course, that I agree with every jot and tittle of the theology featured in the movie. It doesnt matter, however, because its a fictional story.  In any case, you don't have to believe in the Bible whatsoever to enter into the story of the characters and enjoy the movie for what it is  a ""What if the Rapture really happened"" mystery/thriller. I don't believe in powerful androids that time-travel from the future, but that doesnt prevent me from enjoying the Terminator flicks.

The more-mainstream 2014 version with Nicolas Cage severely truncated the story, focusing only on the first three chapters of the book, which involve the airplane coming back home after the vanishings, plus cutting-&-pasting the romance of Buck & Chloe from later in the book to the beginning of the movie.  This didn't make it bad, although uber-fans of the book likely object to the smaller focus. Regardless, the 2014 version worked for me simply as a survival/mystery story. By focusing on one family and one airplane & two passengers, it drives its point home without being convoluted and awkwardly preachy. The two strong male protagonists and two female co-stars are a plus. Furthermore, the plot is ""amazing"" because how else would you describe a situation where millions of people, including all children, suddenly vanish with only their clothes left behind? It would be an incredible experience, to say the least, not to mention a serious wake-up call for those remaining. So the 2014 movie is effective as a ""What if?"" survival/mystery and set-up for sequels (which will never happen because it failed at the box office).

This 2000 version with Kirk Cameron is much more ambitious even though it cost significantly less and is 15-minutes shorter. Incredibly, the screenwriters were able to cut out the fat and cram most of the book into 95 minutes without seeming overly convoluted, although much of the first act might be a little complicated to people who haven't read the book. The CGI effects appear near the beginning with an air-attack over Israel and they're noticeably weak (the aircrafts look like blurs in the sky). But the score is quite good and the story is compelling with believable characters and well-done prayer/ministry sequences, which aren't easy to pull-off. Lastly, they didn't do too bad with the Antichrist element.

The film was shot in Israel, Missouri, Chicago and Toronto.

632701,3,6303382347,"This is obviously a movie in which those involved invested a great deal of effort, but even so it is in some ways a disappointing film. The film, based upon the phenomenally successful book (and series) of the same name, had a lot to work with, but clearly the budget wasn't up to the challenge of adapting the source novel with complete success. It's obvious from the battle scenes at the outset that special effects aren't going to be the movie's strength, and as the film goes on other weaknesses appear: the script is uneven, clearly struggling with regards to which elements from the novel to bring to the table, and moreover the acting, though quite good from some quarters, is of highly variable quality. The soundtrack is annoying to boot, often veering wildly off into bad pop confections that do nothing but distract from the drama.

Despite its undeniable weaknesses, I think that overall Left Behind is a respectable film that is worth a watch, especially for fans of the original book. Kirk Cameron is solid in the lead, and does a lot to carry the picture through its rough patches. The script may not be well balanced, but the underlying message of the Gospel is still there. The romantic element between Buck and Chloe is surprisingly effective, though subtle, and in the end the evil embodied in the antichrist and the awful reality of the fate to which he is steering the whole planet is conveyed with a certain amount of malevolent resonance.

There is no question it would have been nice to see a superior film version of the extremely popular Left Behind novel, but in reality this is not quite the cinematic disaster it could have been. Indeed, in balance, Left Behind the movie successfully overcomes many--not all, but many--of its inherent flaws.",1437955200,,1771,4.765472312703583

632959,3,6303382347,"Left Behind is a Christian movie based on the novel of the same title by Reverend Tim LaHaye and Jerry B. Jenkins. This apocalyptic thriller tells the story of the end of times when rapture happens.

Rayford Steele is an airline pilot whose marriage is on the rocks after her wife has decided to spend most of her time in the church. This resulted in an affair with a fellow stewardess,Hattie. In their flight towards London,a number of their passengers disappear for no apparent reason and a number of chaotic events happen in the world. We also meet other characters along the way such as Buck Williams, a television journalist, is pondering the rash of sudden disappearances as he works on a report about Dr. Chaim Rosenzweig, an Israeli scientist who has devised a formula that would make any soil on earth easy to cultivate.

Too bad that this movie resulted into becoming a poor one. Instead of trying to send the message of the coming apocalyptic events such as the end of the world,its poor writing and performances resulted into unintended ridiculous film-making due to poor writing,dialogues between characters and performances from the actors. Too bad that a Christian movie like this imparts messages that is far from what Jesus thought his follower and the Biblical scripture-based events that would happen as stated in the Book of Revelations turned out to become an unintended action thriller. A better remake was tried last year but it only resulted to worse film instead of a better film adaptation.",1421884800,,1516,4.8949416342412455

The actors are pretty good for their roles even if the only known celebrity in this movie was Kirk Cameron from Growing Pains, who has moved on to doing Christian-related movies since then. It got at least two sequel movies and that was it before Tim LaHaye and Jerry B. Jenkins got Cloud Ten Pictures to stop making films based on the series because they thought the three films were low-quality.

633562,1,6303382347,"I do have to give this movie props, it certainly knows its audience. If you happen to be in that audience - American evangelical fundamentalist premillennial dispensationalist - you'll probably enjoy it. If you're not, you'll spend the whole film either very offended, or laughing and rolling your eyes at how inept it is.

In the first 5 minutes we see thousands of unidentified CGI plans flying in perfect formation like this is the world's biggest airshow, when in fact they are launching an unprovoked attack on the ally of the only remaining superpower. And they all mysteriously blow up. This casual mingling of supernatural elements with much of the later ""plot"" - correlating modern events with Biblical ""prophecy"" - is a bit of a hard thing to take seriously. I can actually suspend disbelief more with the later ""Rapturing"" than with this incident; while one is the major plot device, the other is just weird and the most ham-fisted attempt at correlation (which is saying something). Also, the movie thinks that Iraq and Israel are in the same time zone. They're not.

With such a brilliant opener, you know you're in for a sweet ride! We are also introduced to the first of our ""heroes"". While not all the performances are terrible, many are. Certainly Kirk Cameron is. Isn't it weird how the more he tries to be serious, the funnier he is? ""Crocoduck!"" Plus, he apparently hasn't aged, since he still looks like he should be on the set of Growing Pains and throwing a sanctimonious hissy-fit to get cast members fired. His tendency to go the entire movie in a series of suits about two sizes too big does not improve his image as this ""award-winning hard-boiled reporter""; it actually makes him look like Steve Guttenberg (who, honestly, I'd rather have, which is something I never thought I'd say). He says 'heck' at one point. Clearly, he's Pulitzer Prize material (I doubt my vestry member MOTHER has said 'heck' since I ditched training wheels).

The airline pilot goes from slightly sleazy and ""atheist"" to preachy and self-righteous overnight. His Raptured wife is ex post facto right in her efforts to push her religion on her family, which for this audience is a ""subtle"" code to pound on doors and ""spread the Good News!"" to people who aren't interested. The daughter also gets an overnight conversion, while losing her nose-ring and what little semblance of personality she had, as well as deciding to dress like someone of the actress's age instead of the character's.

It's sexist, it relies on Easy Evangelism, it gets bona fide facts wrong (ex: claiming that Solomon's Temple was destroyed by the Romans; that was the SECOND Temple, the First having been destroyed by the Babylonians under Nebuchadnezzar [cf 2 Kings 25]). These people don't even know their own scriptures! Speaking of, it's the same hodge-podge of Daniel, Ezekiel, Revelation, etc., that have enthralled millenarianists since Attila ravaged Illyricum Something that I actually would have liked to seen answered, wasn't: what about the (overwhelming majority of) Christians who don't believe in the Rapture? Did they disappear, too, or where they ""Left Behind"" because they weren't the Right Kind of Christians?

The UN does not work this way. Every time they mention the UN, ignore their claims, because they are lying to you. It cannot just appoint kings (seriously, *kings!*) over what are supposed to be these tiny plots of land, but on the map appear to be huge swaths of several countries. Described as ""useless real estate"", one apparently encompasses most of South America, which kinda already has a major agricultural base, and indeed has since British neo-colonial investment in the 19th century. Do the people who made this really not know how the world works? Did they ever even graduate high school?

The villain is named Nicolae Carpathia. That's about as authentic as an American named Bob Adirondack. Admittedly, it was kinda awesome seeing him get rid of his would-be puppet masters at the end, even if it didn't make much sense. And he certainly dresses better than ""Buck"". Yes, everyone in this movie has a ridiculous name.

The end credits are accompanied by what sounds like the Backstreet Boys wailing about the ""end times"". The rest of the music isn't much better.

Overall, a terrible movie. Watch to be entertained/annoyed at every single aspect. If you want a good religious film on the other hand, stick with Ben-Hur.",1404518400,6,4438,4.939678284182306

And my favorite example -  Buck is in the public restroom when he finally realizes ""It's true. It's ALL true"" Then, leaning against the wall of the restroom, he slides down to sit on the floor (ick) to pray.  Was that the reflection of a camera crewperson's head visible for a moment in the shiny bathroom wall? (some people will pay good money just to see if I'm right)  Then we cut to Buck standing in front of the restroom mirror - seeming to peer into his soul - with urinals in background - as inspirational music amps up.  Hmmmm.

Now I've always thought the Rapture was part scare tactic and part, well, a sort of cliquish arrogance. That ""we good people are going to be whisked away and all you people who are not as good as us won't be invited to our party. Too bad.""  Where's the love in that?  Wouldn't those very good people who were taken be sickened and horrified that so many people they cared about were going to experience some horrible events to come?  Wouldn't they beg to return to help those left behind?  Or would they just say, yippee!!  I made it !! - too bad for you guys!

Left Behind: Where'd Everybody Go? is about winning souls. It is a tool that can win the lost even if if you just leave it lying around your house. It is also a tool that can win the soul of the unbeliever long before the rapture ever takes place. Most importantly, it will answer some of the questions that those left behind will be asking:

  * Who left and where did they go?
  * Who is this great leader that has arisen onto the world scene? Who is his partner?
  * What is this New World Order they are talking about?
  * Why shouldn't I believe them with all the incredible powers they have?
  * What is this mark of allegiance and why shouldn't I take it?
  * What is going to happen next? How is it all going to end?
  * What can I do from here? What are my choices?

  Special Interviews with Peter and Paul Lalonde, Hal Lindsey, Dr. John Walvoord, John Ankerberg, Zola Levitt and Dave Breese.""

 This VHS tape was releases in 1989, long before the Left Behind movie series. It's produced by Peter and Paul Lalonde, the founders of Cloud 10 Pictures, which also produced the Left Behind Movie series.
 I found this video to be pretty amazing. If you believe in the rapture, this video is must viewing, if for no other reason than to give you an idea of why you should be telling people about Jesus. This video will equip you with the scriptural knowledge that you need to be prepared to give an answer for the hope that is within you. More importantly, this is meant to be a source if information for those that find it after the rapture takes place.
 This video is also available on DVD, and if your a Christian, you should have this one in your video library.",1377302400,,1855,4.297687861271676

""The story ""Left Behind"" is based on is a powerful one. It makes me think of the old song ""I Wish We'd All Been Ready"" by dc Talk. It's definitely a movie meant to send a clear message: get right with God before it's too late. And it does a decent job of conveying that to the audience.

634011,1,6303382347,"As a young fellow in the '70's, I remember a time when many churches were going through a phase of fascination with so-called ""end time prophecy"".  Even the church my parents and I attended fell under this spell, transforming itself from a quiet though irrationally fundamentalist rural fellowship into a circus of flailing arms and visions, rife with all sorts of charismatic performances, including healings, casting out demons, and other such nonsense.  Books by opportunists such as Hal Lindsey and Salem Kirban flooded the Christian markets, pushing those naive enough to allow it into a virtually perpetual state of paranoia.  ""It's coming, it's just around the corner!"" was the mantra of the evangelical dispensationalists.  Being by nature a healthy skeptic and having been blessed with an analytical mind, I began to take a close look at these claims of prophetic manifestations, which were being touted as so obviously tied to the events of our time.  (They weren't, in fact they were very vague, and could have been equally portrayed as reflecting just about any time in human history.)  I also undertook a serious and scholarly approach to the study of theology, religion, history, and science, as they are all related.  All the while, Hollywood jumped on the bandwagon and released ""The Omen"", followed by two sequels.  Now we have ""Left Behind"".

Whether it is a sincere effort by misinformed religious zealots or merely another financial endeavour seeking to rake in profits from well intentioned but undereducated believers, it serves to perpetuate the same falsehoods which took root during the religious fervor known as the ""Great Awakening"".  During this period of American history, there was an evangelical wave which swept across the nation in the form of tent revivals and radicalism, led by a new breed of ""preachers"", most of whom had never bothered to seek a formal education.  They felt they had been ""called"" to the ministry by God or Jesus or someone.  Their lack of theological training left them to attempt to decipher the scriptures on their own, and they took things literally, not understanding the metaphors and symbolism of the times in which those scriptures were originally conceived.  This was around the middle 19th century, and the movement has flourished off and on since then.

The bottom line is books such as Revelation and Daniel speak of the events of the day, not the events of our time or our future.  While there is some debate regarding which Roman emperor was being referred to as ""the antichrist"", most agree it was likely Nero Caesar (his numeroligical name, under the old Roman system, would have been 666, though this number is also referenced in scripture as 616, another contradiction Christian apologists prefer to ignore).  The beast which ""rose from the sea"" was a symbolic description of the Roman Empire as it existed at that time.  Any serious student of the Bible would know this, which leads me to believe ""Left Behind"" is more about profit than prophecy, as is often the case.

If you can watch this film and not take it seriously, it may be somewhat entertaining, though I can't imagine why.  If it's entertainment you want, Sam Neil did a much better job as Damien in the final ""Omen"" installment.  Just keep in mind the fact that it is fantasy, not a factual portrayal of something that's ""just around the corner"".",1328745600,10,3383,4.964539007092198
634012,4,6303382347,"In most movies based on books they unfortunately must leave out a lot of content, usually due to time constraints. Such is the case with Left Behind. I understand it and know there is not much that can be done. What can be done, though, is to make sure the right content is selected and that what is selected is put together in a good way that keeps the story coherent and the main message of the book intact. I loved the book (the entire series actually), but felt the movie seemed to not be as impacting mostly due to the content that was left out. Of course, maybe if I had not read the book first it would have seemed better, but I just did not feel anywhere near the thrill from watching the movie that I got from the books. That being said, I think it does still give a good message and can help people understand end time prophecies by presenting one plausible scenario. I would recommend the books in this series over the movies (all of them), but the movies are worth seeing even if they may not have the same impact. And of course I would say if you can get an unbeliever to watch with you (since it would be harder to get them to read the book) then it could definitely be a valuable tool in getting a conversation started about end times and man's need for salvation through Christ.",1322784000,3,1294,4.242914979757085

634103,5,6303382347,"Based on the best-selling series by Tim LaHaye and Jerry B. Jenkins this movie goes a bit beyond, showing a little bit of what happens before the world goes crazy when the rapture takes place and millions of people disappear in the middle of the night right out of their clothes.

I read the series a couple times, and though it cannot remain true to the series due to the cataclysmic events that take place.  It was very well done.  The scenes were realistic from the dog running around on his leash without his owner to the man with blood dripping down his face.

Kirk Cameron's role as a young Buck Williams was well done.  His portrayal of the star reporter that goes above and beyond for the story and the doubts that arise out of the panic of missing people to the entrance of a world leader who doesn't have answers but knows how to find them is compelling to say the least.

Brad Johnson plays the role of the airline captain who lost his wife and son in the rapture, and though hesitant to admit what happened does embrace the reality of the rapture and soon convinces his daughter played by Janaya Stephens.

Clarence Gilyard of Walker Texas Ranger fame is outstanding as the repentant preacher who missed the rapture because he played the game without living it, thinking he was doing a good job getting by until he was left behind while most of the church was gone.

Gordon Currie plays the up and coming world leader who will find all the answers.  His charm is second only to his command of the people surrounding him as he works to hide his true intentions and sets up his role as the Anti-Christ.

634105,4,6303382347,"Overview:

This film attempts to show a probable scenario of when the Rapture takes place. The engaging element shown is when passengers at 37,000 feet in the air start to realise that their family members who were on board with them on the flight can no longer be accounted for. Only their clothes and personal effects can be found. Panic ensues on the plane. However, when they land, it is discovered that the situation is a global event. I find that this event was well portrayed.

Persons of non-Pentecostal beliefs may be offended by this movie, because they do not believe in the Rapture, or what the scriptures have to say about it. So don't be misled by ravenous bad reviews of this film. They simply do not believe, nor understand.

Storyline:

The storyline unfolds on two fronts:

[1] The turmoil experienced by a family as half is left behind (father/pilot and daughter) and the other half has been raptured (mother/wife and son).

[2] The Beast coming into power as the Secretary General of the United Nations. Nicolae Carpathia (Gordon Currie) portrays the part quite well. Key GNN reporter Buck Williams (Kirk Cameron) tries to thread the events together as he collects key information from different sources including the Bible.

Conclusion:

This film can be a good avenue to help tell others about the Rapture and how soon it will really take place.

They couldn't have picked a better place than on an airplane in the air to have the Christians and children disappear - I mean, where else could they have gone?

The reaction of the people left behind is portrayed well by Brad Johnson (Capt. Rayford Steele), Kirk Cameron (Buck Williams) and Clarence Gilyard (Rev. Bruce Barnes) - playing a minister who had spoken the Word, yet was left behind. His line, ""There's a difference between knowing and believing."" That is the problem with may who profess to be Christian - they know the details, but they don't believe.

634182,3,6303382347,"Almost a great movie.

The film makers presented this movie as an ""evangelical witness,"" entertainment designed to lead people to the Christian faith. Unfortunately, when the premise of the story is ""accept Christ or suffer hell on Earth,"" I sincerely doubt that unbelievers will be reached by this. It comes off like a ""hellfire threat."" Last Days prophecy are controversial, and are very polarizing.

I like the film's opening music... a nice ""biblical"" score. Having Israel attacked ups the intrigue, although having the elderly scientist narrate the sequence of events to ""Buck Williams"" felt contrived. The CGI effects are not too obvious.

The plot twists and turns, and the antichrist is chillingly effective. He is a subtle manipulator, meek and compassionate by all appearances...until he finally shows his true face at film's end.

The casting is well done, although Kirk Cameron seems too ""boyish"" to be this experienced, world traveling reporter. But Cameron delivers a good performance, and has to seem young to make his budding romance with college student ""Chloe"" more appropriate.

Some ""cornballish"" elements that ruin this movie...
Contemporary Christian music woven into the scenes.
Overdone, melodramatic scenes of remorse, repentance, and conversion.
Some of the dialogue is clumsy. A few lines are delivered in an unarticulate way.
The converted Rayford Steele often comes off like a ""Hare Krishna,"" especially when ""witnessing"" to his daughter and his ""almost"" mistress.

When he finds out someone is shooting down planes, but it's not them, he runs out of the base to capture the live activity on camera.  Buck is suddenly met with a mysterious man in the middle of the turmoil and tells him a religious verse.

Now dozens of people onboard are gone. On land, there are car accidents and people hae disappeared.

I was bracing myself to see a shakily-filmed movie with a bunch of wooden actors spouting off dispensationalist dogma but it really wasn't like that at all. To be sure, the obsequiousness towards the Israelis was distasteful, its theology inane, and I can't claim that this movie is good enough to ever watch again, but it wasn't as bad as I feared. I was actually surprised by the production value and the actors wouldn't have been out of place in a mainstream movie. Mercifully, the religious agitprop, although central to the plot, played second fiddle to the mystery and suspense. Of course, this film, and the book it was based on, originates with the 19th century made-up doctrine of the Rapture, which makes anything related to ""Left Behind"" a good candidate for the trash can. This kind of religious science fiction would be just as diverting as any other kind of fantasy if so many millions didn't accept its un-Biblical doctrines as Gospel truth and voted accordingly. The ""Left Behind"" franchise is a spawn of Satan which has perverted the Gospel and influenced American politics for the worse by pushing us towards war with Israel's enemies. These evil books and movies should be opposed by every patriotic American and Christian with his head screwed on properly.",1185062400,5,1502,4.87109375

634288,1,6303382347,"Given the tremendous sum of money that this series of novels has garnered, prior to its adaptation to the big screen, this movie is a dismal failure and a testament to the sacrifice of quality in favor of fiscal stinginess.  There is no excuse for providing a loyal fan base with a cheap B-grade level, not-quite-good-enough-for-prime-time hack job, however Cloud Ten Productions has managed to hash out 95 minutes of visual drivel that even a low-budget Third World airline wouldn't bother scheduling on their red-eye flights.

The Internet Movie Database offers this bit of insight into the ""artistry"" of Paul Lalonde who is the ""creative"" (*gag!*) half of the ""fabulous"" Lalonde brothers, founders of Cloud Ten: ""With two degrees in psychology, Paul is able to apply his knowledge of the human psyche to the characters in his movies.""  One would expect that this level of academic acumen might justify having a better sense of casting for a movie than settling for the likes of Kurt Cameron, Janaya Stephens, and host of others that usually wind up as the expendable extras who are sliced and diced in a cheesy horror film.  Cameron is one of the most over-rated thespians I've ever seen and given the pathetic display of his craft here I am proud to say that I have never seen an episode of ""Growing Pains"".  Brad Johnson and Clarence Gilyard are the only surviving hope for this sleeping-pill-on-celluloid and it's tragic that their talent is wasted and that they are surrounded by untalented no-names who can't act themselves out of a wet paper bag.  A Canadian to play Carpathia?  Am I to be convinced that they couldn't find a European actor with a better accent than this DeNiro wanna-be?  Any serious scholar of eschatology knows that the AntiChrist will arise out of the resurrected Roman Empire and there should have been an effort to find an actor to the task.

The whole production is a farce, the majority of which was shot in Canada (now there's convincing on-location environment for you) and shows no initiative of capturing the feel for the Holy Land.  Having seen multiple films that have been filmed in the Middle East, this gets the ""Let's Just Throw It Together And Forget About Authenticity Because We Assume Our Viewing Audience Are Morons Without A Clue"" award.

The lousy special effects further rob this film of any credibility.  The apocalyptic theme demands visual effects that should be inferior to none.  After all, the intent here is to show the end of this world and provide visual shock-and-awe.  It is more schlock-and-yawn and, like the song ""It's the End of the World as We Know It"" by the ending credits I still feel fine.

Sadly, this is a testament to what happens when a production company is chosen because of its claims to being a Christian film company, not based upon its ability to deliver quality.

Words fail me to pen my disappointment with this whole ""Left Behind"" film escapade.  I would sooner  recommend the End Times thrillers ""The Omega Code"" and its sequel ""Omega Code II: Armageddon"" for more mystery, action, intrigue, and one heck of a more enjoyable viewing experience.",1168646400,10,3130,4.840525328330206

I was never interested in the books, not being the most religious sort, but I love well done religious themed films.

The Classic B-Movies of the 30's to the 60's have many elements in common with this film: Interesting Plot, complete with holes, and a message. A cheap budget that means cheap ( but good )effects, and sets, not to mention interesting location shooting choices, and lesser known, and unknown actors.

The actors are committed to their craft, and the talent displayed ranges from Awful to Oscar ( well, ok, maybe not, but still some very inspired performances ) and, if you are lucky you get a recognizable actor with a history of quality work ( Kirk even backs the message, and is committed to the series, and Lou Gossett Jr. appears in the 3rd film! ).

Today I finished it and I enjoyed it quite a lot.  Can't wait to get my hands on the next... eleven.  Anyway I got the movie in the mail from here used a few days ago and, novel read, I watched it.  Wow, what a dissapointment.  Important plot elements and character-defining scripts were ripped and torn out, dropped upon the preverbial cutting-room floor.  Even unnecessarily removed pieces were cut like the guard's side-arm being replaced by a police special revolver to a Beretta.  My question: why?  Carpathia was just a seemingly tossed in figure with no personality or direction.  He seemed like a random guy that just popped up and said ""I'm gonna own the world.""  Steele didn't have to take any time to think over his commitment for God, he just said, ""Okay, I believe now.""  Unrealistic!  Acting was bad, dialogue was bad...  The actors used in the roles portrayed them well visually, but other than that... meh.  Even the way the preacher of the video tape sat was changed.  It's like they purposefully made the book and movie different.  Want to get the real story?  Spend a couple extra hours and ENJOY the book.

(The second half I began to get the feeling that they were milking this cash cow for all it was worth).  So I was excited when I heard that Left Behind was coming out with a movie.

The only thing similar to the book is the names of the characters.  They even changed Buck's occupation (I heard the producer say that film is a visual medium, and so you can't have a newspaper reporter in a major role in a movie.  Apparently there are no movies about newspaper reporters.)  The book's main thrust was figuring out what the disappearances were all about.  The movie glosses over it and turns into the exact same story as every other end times movie.  I could go on and on, but I won't... go see a good Christian movie like End of the Spear, or Time Changer, or RSTC.  Leave Left Behind out of it.",1156636800,8,898,4.204678362573099
634293,4,6303382347,"You ask if this (Tribulation) is true, than why bother being a Christian , you can live how you want and then get your 2nd chance in the Tribulation after the Rapture. Well, I assure you, a 'pre-trib' rapture is by FAR the most believed of the three (incl. mid-trib rapture or no rapture...just the Second Coming) The most blatant,obvious proof in scripture of a pre-trib rapture is found in 1 Thessalonians 4:16-17 : 'For the Lord himself will come down from heaven with a commanding shout,with the call of the archangel,and with the trumpet call of God. First,all the Christians who have died will rise from the graves. Then,together with them,we who are still alive and remain on the earth will be caught up in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air and remain with Him forever.(NLT)

There is a very good reason to accept Christ NOW before this happens . God promises tomorrow to NO ONE. If anyone that hasn't accepted Christ should die tonight, there IS no second chance, they'll spend eternity in hell and then the lake of fire(unbelievers judged at the Great White Throne Judgement will be cast with Satan into the lake of fire..Revelation 20:11-15) after Christ's 1000 year reign on earth. Even if you choose to deny Christ until after the Rapture and intend on turning to Him during the 7 year Tribulation, it won't be a picnic. Christians will be persecuted and hunted down day and night and be killed, most likely beheaded for their beliefs. The worst of the years will be the final 3 1/2 years which will culminate with Armagedden. As God said in 2 Corinthians 6:2 TODAY is the day of salvation"" I'm looking SO forward to that day when the Lord will come for me and all born again believers that we won't HAVE to endure the tortures during the Tribulation.

do to well in the theatre(thanks to other films with sex,

language and gun shoot-outs), But it still is able to find

a place in your heart.

OK, here's the drill. On an overseas flight to London,

journalist Buck Williams and pilot Rayford Steele are caught

in the most incredible event in history. Suddenly, without

warning, dozens of passengers simply VANISH into thin air.

But it doesn't stop there. It soon becomes clear that MILLIONS

of people around the world are missing.

Two evil british agents send out a murderer after Buck because

he is on to they're plot to take over the israeli border.

Meanwhile a mysterious Eroupean named Nicolae Carpathia, or,

as we christians like to say, ""the great deciever"" rises into

power and evreyone starts thinking he's the messiah.

634295,5,6303382347,"I normally watch films on DVD, but Left Behind seems to be better served by tape. Why? you ask. Well, tape gives this feature a gritty realism that can't be found in the story or the acting or the delightfully heavy-handed moralism it attempts to convey.

I also advise that before you view this, you have several pots of very strong coffee to keep you alert to every piece of minutiae that this film is trying toget across. Because every choice in this movie is deliberate, meant to show you what will happen if you do not repent and become a child of the way immediately. I do not advise any counterpoint or negative views, here. There is to be no discussion.

I do wear my Left Behind t-shirt at the bus stop and that seems to get a laugh or two every now and then from passing motorists though I'll also get a lewd fingure gesture occasionally as well.

The movie also was less subtle about the main characters coming to Christ, and realizing what actually happened to those left behind. Some of the acting was a little bland.

I will admit I did find the DVD somewhat entertaining, and I might have liked it even more if I didn't read the books first. Overall I would suggest watching it, not expecting too much, before buying it.",1142899200,6,701,4.351145038167939

Chloe the 'surprisingly adult' young woman in the novels has been reduced to a whining woman with an unfashionable nose ring which doesn't suit her face. At least get the woman a nostril stud.

634361,1,6303382347,"I must agree with the other reviewer that it feels almost cruel to review this movie. This movie has a general low-budget, B-movie feel. I will examine its poor quality in several areas:

Story: lame. A hackneyed, mediocre, and unbelievable concept to begin with. Not particularly creative in either concept or story and especially well-executed. There are plenty of other Rapture films out there that have much better storylines than this. The script is often extremely preachy, even speaking as an evangelical Christian. For example, it includes the ""manditory"" scene in which someone ""accepts Jesus,"" even though this has very little to do with the story and does not advance the plot or help develop the characters and was obviously thrown in just because this is an evangelical movie and the filmmakers felt they had to ""evangelize"" people (although I wouldn't show this to my non-Christian friends for sheer embarassment, and if I weren't a Christian, I certainly wouldn't want to see it!).

Visuals: not good in the least. Cinematography wasn't impressive to say the least, and the production and visual design, as well as visual elements such as sets, costumes, and makeup were very low quality. David Mamet once rightly commented that a filmmaker must, above all else, think VISUALLY, and the visuals in ""Left Behind"" are sadly lacking.

Special effects: horrible. Obviously low-budget. Not convincing in the least.

Acting: amateurish. Cameron is alright I guess (although he looks very young for the role), but the rest of the cast isn't. The antichrist character, for example, has a REALLY phony accent.

I wouldn't recommend this to anyone, Christian or non-Christian. It does not have any artistic merit.",1140393600,11,1718,5.16546762589928

Its an excellent movie compared to the other tons of crappy Christian movies,but is it Hollywood standard?Well,no. Acting is average with the exception of that pilot guy(dunno his name lol) and special effects look like theyve been stolen from some B-Grade Multiplayer Strategy game. But overall the movie was good,watchable at the very least. I'd recommend it to any Christian,but to others,watch if uve got the time and if uve seen every other movie in the world.",1136332800,3,799,4.755395683453237

Such was the fear instilled in my young mind concerning the Christian belief in their impending mass exodus from this world. It has haunted me all my life.

Having said that, I'm really surprised at the number of - 1 Star - ratings this movie has received. Yes, this is a Christian movie that has a specific agenda designed to convert the viewer and admitedly that desire to convert is overdone in a number of scenes that may make the casual viewer want to turn off the film and look elsewhere.

Taking the evangelical nature of the film as a given and looking beyond the Protestant basis you might be surprised to discover that this is not as bad as you might expect.

Yes there is alot of predictability in this film because Christians don't like to substitute their truth to make something more palitable for mass comsumatiion. However, if you give it a chance and go with the flow I think you will discover a rather interesting movie that may not change your mind, but will at least make you think.",1134777600,9,1197,4.532407407407407

I knew what this was when I got it. Or at least thought I did. I thought it was a movie that was going to show what the world would look like if Rapture ever happened. And it was going to show if from a News Anchor point of view. It does...for the first eight minutes or so. Then the movie ends and you have three men trying to save you for the rest of the tape.

It's an evangelistic tape that advertised as a movie in a news format to simulate what news broadcasts might be like after the Rapture. And though these are not my beliefs, when it started I thought it would be interesting to watch. Even though the quality of production is quite low. If they would have followed the story line, it might have been worth watching.

Do yourself a favor and walk past this film. If you are already a believer save yourself the pain. If you are not, this will have you running to turn the tape off. If you want this type of movie, get the LaHaye Left Behind tape. At least it is a movie.

I know that scripts always have to differ from the book. After all they are dealing with a visual media and 2 hour time frame. But this movie really changes many things. But if the book were written like this script, the book would have been half the size and probably had a more powerful impact.

634444,4,6303382347,"On a crowded New York to London flight, Captain Rayford Steele (Brad Johnson) was thinking about his flight attendant Hattie Durham (Chelsea Noble), while she was thinking about her new upcoming job at the United Nations. Cameron ""Buck"" Williams (Kirk Cameron) was taking a nap after finishing some research on his laptop. None of them knew that they were about to be thrust into the worst nightmare of their lives: The Rapture.

Based on the first book of the hugely successful ""Left Behind"" novel series, this movie gives us a glimpse of what life will be like for those left behind after the rapture. There have been many reviews written over the years giving this movie poor reviews for the sole reason that it is not as good as the book. And it is nowhere near as good as the book. But then again, what movie is? Short of the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy, I'm hard pressed to think of any.

You will need to largely forget about the book when watching this (or any) movie. Although not at all perfect, ""Left Behind - The Movie"" is a gripping story that will force you to think. Not too many movies can really do that.

After the rapture, Buck, Captain Steele, his daughter Chloe (Janaya Stephens), and former faux-pastor Bruce Barnes (Clarence Gilyard Jr.) will each look for answers to the disappearances. The answers they find will intertwine their lives together in a way none of them could have imagined. But will they understand the meaning of those answers in time? They better, because the Antichrist has come to power in the form of Nicolae Carpathia (played perfectly by Gordon Currie). And if he has anything to say about it, everyone on Earth will bow before him.

There are problems with the movie. In the beginning, the script is noticeably weak and all the actors seem uncomfortable in their roles. It almost feels like the actors were each cast that morning and filming that night. However, as the movie continues the script gets stronger and the message gets louder. When the rapture does finally occur, the scenes of clothes and jewelry left exactly where a person would have been are chilling.

This side of ""The Passion of the Christ,"" this movie is one of the best looking Christian movies ever made. It is worth checking out, even if it doesn't match the book.",1115337600,4,2285,4.6600496277915635
634515,1,6303382347,"""Left Behind"", as a series of books, are superb and extremely popular. The movie adaptation on the other hand is so poor it's as un-funny as the Rapture itself.

I recognize that religious communities are frustrated because they can't seem to market their messages properly in the mainstream movie industry (It has since worked with Mel Gibson's ""Passion of the Christ"" and the well-done ""Prince of Egypt""), but with this film you can bet why Hollywood doesn't turn the other cheek.

First let me tackle the marketing. This film boasts one of the worst marketing failures I've ever seen, and I'll tell you why. They shot ""Left Behind"" under a reasonably tight budget, then instead of just releasing it into theaters decided to put them out on DVD (and VHS) and select theaters simultaneously, so that when people BOUGHT the movie and told their friends about it, they would then be compelled to WATCH it in theaters. Needless to say, it was a dumb move and thus cements the movie-making aspect of the ""Left Behind"" franchise as a dismal failure, unless it shapes up for a ""Nicolae"" movie. It's unfortunate really, because everything about the books screams for top-notch cinematic treatment.

Onto the movie. I remember praising ""Taxi Driver"" because everyone who was involved in its production, down to the lighting and cinematography, worked in flawless harmony to create a great film. The direct opposite is achieved here. The directing, the special effects, the cinematography, the continuity, and much more are all screwed up and manage to drown out considerable acting by, let's face it, washed-out actors. The character of Nicolae Carpathia, the anti-christ, is seriously underplayed. I won't delve into the unnecessary pop song that represents the film, because it is truly stupid and irritating.

As I say with every bad movie, rent it first and formulate your own opinion, but I strongly recommend the books over this poor imitation of what could have been a tale of horror, excitement and the endearing power of faith and truth.",1115078400,10,2039,5.005899705014749
634516,1,6303382347,"In a number of ways, ""Left Behind"" [2000] is almost a rationale for US foreign policy of the last few years. Just two examples: at the beginning of the film, a massive air fleet, originating in Iraq, is shown crossing the Israeli border, then getting mysteriously destroyed without any intervention from the Israelis. Was Iraq being set up as a suitable target for the actual US invasion of Iraq about three years after the film was made? Did the horrific events of September 11 a year later serve to further demonize Iraq? Second: in the film, the United Nations is shown as falling under the control of the Antichrist, who plans to introduce one world government and a single world currency. Is this very far from the fevered imaginings of the UN's real enemies in the US? Much has been written about the dangers of Moslem extremism, and rightly so. But the point is that the Christian fundamentalist extremists, the kind of people who take the ""Left Behind"" garbage seriously, are right there in the driver's seat of American foreign policy, while Moslem extremists are just that -- on the margins of Islam. An ugly and foolish film, but it explains a great deal about prevailing American official attitudes to the rest of the world. That's how it looks from Australia.",1112486400,9,1272,4.760180995475113
634517,1,6303382347,"I've been a big fan of the Left Behind book series.  I would describe them as a Christian sermon wrapped up in a Jerry Bruckheimer kind of movie.  The movie adaptation was a poor attempt to bring the books to life, but wasn't anyone's fault.  The movie company that made this (Cloud Ten Pictures I think) didn't have the budget it really needed to bring these books to life.  Columbia Pictures didn't seem all that enthusiastic about distributing it either.  (Anyone remember seeing any movie posters or trailers?  I sure don't.)  I guess the reason for this is Hollywood is looking for movies that promote tolerance and respect toward other people's religious beliefs and the Left Behind Books don't do that.  Also the Left Behind books are not meant to be films, because they don't really have endings to them.  The last few chapters of the first book makes you want to read the second, the last few chapters of the second book makes you want to read the third and so on, and they're designed that way.  You can't do that with movies unless you promsise the movie goer there will be sequels (like the Lord of the Rings films did for example) and the last film will have a solid ending to it.

To make this work you would have to bring all twelve books to life on screen and that would require an enormous budget (literally about a billion dollars) and no Hollywood studio is going to spend that kind of money on a project that will likely offend half the world's population.

But if that did happen... wouldn't Tom Cruise make a great Nicolae Carpathia?",1112054400,7,1555,4.534050179211469

My opinion is that anyone interested in dramatization of LEFT BEHIND should get the Audio Dramas on CD (the ones produced by Gap Digital).

634519,5,6303382347,"Being a full believing Christian, when I was ten, I saw this film. I wondered where the heck they had gotten all this information about people disappearing into thin air, and going to heaven. I flipped through my bible but couldn't find anything that matched the discription. That's when I decided to read the book. It soon all came clear to me what will soon happen, and fast. I don't want to be left behind and I think that's the point the authors and the movie makers of the book wanted to make. They don't want anyone else to be left behind either.

In the movie, Captain Rayford Steele (Brad Johnson) and newscaster Buck Williams (Kirk Cameron) are on a 747 bound for London when out of nowhere, passengers on the plane just disappear! It doesn't stop there though. When the plane lands, it is clear they're not the only one with this problem. All over the world, people have disappeared without a trace leaving their clothes, and belongings behind. Rayford comes home to find his wife and son gone, but his daughter (Janaya Stephens) still alive. Buck finds a few of his friends still alive, but it is obvious someone is after him as he tries to find the answer. Rayford has already found his answer, though. It all lies within one simple book, and his heart.

Watching this film really opened my eyes to the truth. This is the real world. This is how it's going to be. It'll only get worse too. What the characters in the books and the movies experienced is hardly anything of what the real people will discover. The original film, A Theif in the Night, was a great source to people in the 70's, but if only more people would've paid attention to it like they did left behind, they would realize it's all around them.

634521,3,6303382347,"The video/DVD starts with beautiful shots of the city of Jerusalem and then pans out to a wheat field in the desert where Cameron Williams, is interviewing the Nobel Peace Prize winner in chemistry and Times Man of the Year...Chiam Rosenzweig about Project Eden that had this field of wheat grow in the desert. Then the next scene is waves and waves of Syrian and Iraqi fighter jets and other Arab states attack Israel. But this is where the story has problems with the film adaptation. First...it is outdated...now that we occupy Iraq. Second Ezekiel 38:1-39:16 speaks of major air and ground offensive by Russia and her Arab allies.

In the movie the time gap of one year and two months between the Invasion and the Rapture mentioned in the book is erased. Both the time gap in the book and the removal of the time gap still posess problems in that Ezekiel 39:9 says it takes Israel seven years to burn the weapons....this has to puss the Invasion back to three and a half to seven years....since at the mid-point Israel under go sever persecution.

Third reason for my disappointment is that the Rapture portrayed in both the book and mvie is that millions of Christians will disappear.

The true Rapture decribed in the Bible is that will take more departed saints than living. True, born again Christians are a minority...and our number is decreasing as the Gospel is compromised for a watered down, market tailored version. When the invisible Church is raptured...the Visible Church and the world will hardly know we have left...and could careless.

Additionally baby's and young children are raptured. Though I would for emotional reasons say babies will be raptured...there is no scriptural ground for this. But young children are a different matter. If they know the difference between good and evil...the Bible says they are accoutible for their sins without setting a specific age for children.

This is only the tip of the iceburg of problems....from the rise of the Antichrist to take over the UN and other events conflict with what the Bible teaches about prophecy.

In the video/DVD we do get a slice of Rayford's life and how unhappy he is with his wife and son being religious which the book presents as flashbacks. But nothing is said of their faith in Jesus as their Savior.

The Gospel of Jesus that changed their lives is short changed in both the book and the movie.

Where do I begin (well, besides the horrid acting...)?  This movie (and I'm guessing the book as well) is laughable at best...the characters are unbelievable and one dimentional...I laughed when several chartacters suddenly had epiphanies that God took their family members away from them and it's all good...I'm sorry, but if my family just vanished by God's will (which, come on now...if my God was like that...count me out of Christianity) I would be questioning why, not accepting it like it was a speeding ticket.  And I'm sorry...Carpathia is a total wimp...if he crossed paths with Randall Flagg (the villian of the Stand), Flagg would have torn him to pieces...

It's scary when I see more Christian values in a Stephen King story...the protagonist characters in the Stand selflessly give their lives to fight for their causes...they do not get whiny and have corny ""I've never prayed before, but I believe"" monologues...you can tell they believe in their cause and they fight for that cause without getting preachy and holier-than-thou.

634681,2,6303382347,"Okay, my review title isn't really accurate; I just wanted to make that bad pun.  I am a big fan of the Left Behind novels, and when I saw the trailers for this film, I thought it looked great and pre-ordered it.  I've never seen a Christian film before, and so I wasn't sure what to expect, although I realized it probably wouldn't havethe same production values as a ""normal"" film.

This movie reminded me a lot of a USA or TNT made-for-TV film.  It obviously didn't have a large budget, but despite the lack of expensive special effects and big name actors, it is mildly entertaining and does look professional.  I just wish I had rented it instead of buying it.

My biggest grip, is with the casting.  Kirk Cameron did not envision my idea of Buck, and Chloe was WAY off. When I was reading the book I never imagined that she'd be some Goth punk with a nose ring.  This type of character is never even hinted at in the novels and I think they probably took some creative license to give their film a little more ""edge.""  I tried to forget about the novels to enjoy the film, but I still couldn't believe in the actors as my favorite characters from the books.  Gordon Currie as Carpathia was an AWFUL choice.  The guy just isn't tough enough to be the anti-Christ.  He seems whiny and weak, not anything like the Carpathia portrayed in the books.

Despite all of these problems, ""Left Behind"" isn't a completely horrible film, especially not if you're judging it based against other Christian films.  But as a stand-alone movie, it has a lot of problems, most notably poor acting, a weak novelized screenplay, and a dissatisfying ending.  After reading the novel, I was disappointed with the film.

As far as the DVD goes, the video transfer can be a bit grainy and shaky at times, although instances of this are few and shouldn't bother you too much.  Sound quality is not really taken advantage of for a movie that had a theatrical release, and almost all audio is presented from your front speakers, so it doesn't matter if you have surround sound.  Basically, it looks like you're watching a television movie instead of a feature film.

DVD extras include a 30-minute ""making of"" special, cast and crew interviews, music videos, and previews of upcoming films.  No commentary on this one.  Overall, if you're a big fan of the book, I'd recommend checking out the film, but advise against purchasing it.  It's not something I'm likely to watch again.",1083715200,4,2457,4.587155963302752
634682,1,6303382347,"I caught ""Left Behind"" on tv the other night, and somehow sat through the whole thing.  I found it amusing later on, when Roman Polanski's ""The Ninth Gate"", a film about the devil and satanism told from a more objective point of view, turned out to be a far better film as far as style and storytelling went (not that that was news to me: I saw ""The Ninth Gate"" for the first time four years ago, bought it three years ago, and have watched it regularly since.  It just happened to be on the other night, and I was glad to have an opportunity to see it again).  In spite of the good intentions of the filmmakers, the movie still does not become watchable.
Bringing to mind memories of watching Steven King's ""The Langoliers"" on tv around a decade or so ago, the crux of the movie's action is based on an event that we see occur in an airplane, which has also occured everywhere else around the world.  Lots and lots of people vanish away, leaving a selected few behind (or is it the other way around as far as selection goes?).  The filmmakers at least DID do something right by having the clothes remain when the people were taken (unlike ""The Langoliers"" ... where only metal objects like wristwatches and braces for teeth inexplicably stayed behind, but that's not enough to merit this film more than a half an extra star).  Also, there was more blood than I expected considering the wholesome demographic I know the makers were aiming for, but that isn't really a positive or negative remark so much as a semi-interesting observation.
First off as far as my complaints go, this movie looks cheap.  That isn't necesarily a bad thing; I know that great things can be done with a limited budget (my own favorite ""Doctor Who"" for one), but if they aren't done properly than the thing won't have a chance to even begin doing its job: that is, entertain.  ""Left Behind"" fails at this; it looks amateurish, feels amateurish, and is therefore no fun to watch, like a bad TV movie (which is all it really is, in spite of its theatrical release).
Second, the acting is atrocious.  I wasn't convinced by a single character (well, halfway by the Israeli scientist at the beginning, but I've got a fondness for those ""elderly wiseman"" types of characters), and therefore had no emotion or care invested into who they were or what happened to them.  The dialogue they were forced to say was either unconvincingly phony or sitcom-stupid, or at best somewhere in between (say, bland).
Finally, there was the story, besides the characters themselves.  Okay, my religious views just don't fall in line with those presented in this movie, so I suppose it is here fair to say that the problem is to a point on my end in this regard.  But the thing is, I would have enjoyed seeing some other reactions to the supernatural occurances in the film besides those of complete unbelievers and evangelical Christians, such as Hindus, Muslims, or those of my own faith, Roman Catholics, as they attempted to deal with and understand the problem.  Also, the fact stands that the prophesies of the Bible more than likely could have more than one interpretation, or could in fact prophesy events which occured in the future for the writer but in the past for us (The Book of Daniel predicting the coming of Alexander the Great, for example, or Revelation's Antichrist being none other than Nero Caesar).  The writers limited their possibilities, and the narrow scope of the movie's story really works against it.
I will finish up by saying that ""Left Behind"" was a real waste of time for me, and I honestly wish I had now done something else with my free evening.  Contrasting it with a really great movie like ""The Ninth Gate"" really worked against it too.  Even if you are an evengelical Christian and buy into this whole Rapture thing, I still wouldn't give this piece of crud my time or money ... I'd just move along and do something, anything else.

634683,5,6303382347,"Perhaps this film will only be fully appreciated by  believers like myself, who are fascinatated by the unfolding of Bible prophesy; I found this film to be enormously entertaining and thought-provoking, and one that becomes clearer and more focused with each successive viewing.
There are scenes that are quite compelling, and true of human nature, as in the episode where some repeat, and even start to believe, the anti-christ's lie, either for self-interest or what is considered to be ""the common good"".
The cast is excellent, with Kirk Cameron as the story-hungry and later truth-hungry reporter, and Brad Johnson as the pilot who loses a few passengers at 35,000 feet.  There are also small parts that are very interesting and well done, like Pastor Bruce Barnes (Clarence Gilyard Jr.), the only one in his church who is ""left behind"", and Dirk Burton (Jack Lanedijk), whose ideas are often dismissed as ""conspiracy theories"".
Gordon Currie is perfect as Nicolae Carpathia, the anti-christ; he is the kind of man that would become an overnight media star, with his half-truths and lies gobbled up as The New Gospel.
As Pastor Barnes says, ""knowing and believing are two different things"". This film will help you figure out what you know and what you believe.
With fast-paced direction by Vic Sarin, a tight and often witty script based on the Lahaye / Jenkins bestseller, good cinematography (George Jiri Tirl) and effects, and a most enjoyable score by James Covell, watching this movie is time well spent, something I find quite rare these days.
This is a low-buget movie that deserves 5 stars, not because it is a masterpiece, but because in its unpretentious way, it delivers, and on many levels; it will feed your brain, feed your soul, and at the same time, be fun to watch. Total running time is 1 hour and 35 minutes.",1082419200,,1833,4.890675241157556

634685,5,6303382347,"With my interest in religious-themed entertainment piqued by some of Hollywood's recent offerings, I decided to seek out the film adaptation of the popular ""Left Behind"" book series. After all, according to NBC's ""Today,"" in some areas the books sell even better than ""Harry Potter"" novels! I'll take Bible-themed stories over black magic and witchcraft any day, thank you very much!
Lo and behold, the first film stars one of my favorite television actors: Mr. Kirk Cameron, who played Mike Seaver on the delightful ""Growing Pains"" program. Fortunately for ""Left Behind,"" his friend Boner is nowhere to be found. Knowing that Kirk has always been very open about his Christian beliefs, I felt he was the perfect choice to headline this franchise-in-the-making. And the built-in fan-base from his hit WB show ""Kirk"" ensures that every episode in the series will be a mega-event!
This gripping film depicts just what might happen if ""the Rapture"" (a Biblical moment where all faithful Christians are teleported to Heaven, leaving behind all the non-believers) came to pass in the modern world. Combining elements from ""the Langoliers,"" ""V,"" and ""the Stand,"" the story traces the paths of a number of those left behind (hence the title) and how they must face the rise of an evil villain bent on world domination. Since I disapprove of wagering, I don't often make gambling analogies--but those sound like some pretty high stakes!
While most Hollywood pictures tend to be glossy, over-produced distillations of bad scripts, ""Left Behind"" goes for a more subdued, low-key feel. By spending more time on character-based arcs (like one man's crisis of faith) than budget-busting scenes of CGI chaos, ""Left Behind"" lets the viewer do the work, and fill in the blanks him or herself. Finally, a movie that allows -- no, FORCES -- me to use my own imagination!
I can only hope that the trend continues, and the ""Left Behind"" film series supplants more secular entertainment on the Box-Office Charts.",1080604800,,1991,5.073170731707317
634686,5,6303382347,"On an overseas flight to London, Journalist Buck Williams (Kirk Cameron) and pilot Rayford Steele (Brad Johnson) are caught in the middle of the most incredible event in history.  Suddenly, without warning, dozens of passengers simply vanish into thin air.  But it doesn't stop there.  It soon becomes clear that millions of people are missing from around the world.  As choas and anachry engulf the world, both men set out on vastly different paths in a desperate search for answers.  Based on the New York Times best-selling novel, Left Behind is overflowing with suspense, action and adventure.  This riveting motion picture will take you on a spellbinding journey through the most mysterious book of the bible The Book of Revelation.  The acting of two of the movie's main actors (Kirk Cameron and his wife Chelsea Noble) is excellent.  This is an excellent movie.  I checked it out from the library and I stayed up until 3:00 in the morning watching it.  If you like movies overflowing with suspense, action, and adventure Left Behind is the movie for you.

For all of us who appreciate these books, I recommend an excellent book about the first book of the Old Testament.
Dennis Shulman's ""Genius of Genesis"" is a reverent and beautifully-written description of the glory of the Book of Genesis; and an excellent text for our church's spring book discussion circle.
If you want to truly understand the Bible, from its last words to its first, read the ""Left Behind"" books and ""The Genius of Genesis.""",1078444800,2,675,4.777777777777778
634770,1,6303382347,"Now seems like an intresting time to look back at this movie and the others along the same line put out by Cloud Ten Productions (Omega Code, Judgement, etc...).We don't need to actually watch them again, as that would be cruel and inhuman,but they help us in discussing the Hollywood mantra,"" religious movies don't sell."" This has been Hollywood's excuse ever since ""The Last Temptation of Christ"".I believe the reason most Hollywood producers wanted nothing to do with the""Christian"" genre is simple ,...they wanted nothing to do with the Christian genre.
  Cloud Ten Productions certainly never helped the situation, incapable directors, and screenplays a child could have written. Not to mention lackluster performances from some fairly talented actors, kept these movies on the low end of the B-movie totem pole. Then along comes ""Left Behind"" and according to Kirk Cameron this is the low budget christian film that we can really use to change Hollywoods minds. Really!!He wanted us to make posters and stuff and to tell our friends...I tried to tell my friends at MST3K but it had gone off the air.
  Like most of the ""Cloud Ten""  movies this one is lacking, greatly, unlike the others it had a ready made story in Tim LaHaynes great books, didn't matter, they still turned out a boring, laughable ""SciFi channelish"" production. And low budget aint got any thing to do with it as we see great and inexspensive low budget films all the time.( Robert Rodriquez made his famous El Mariachi for a mere 7000.00.)
  It has to do with vision,talent and skill, something the books posess and the movies do not.
  Most of the reviews on Amazon for this movie involve what the filmakers(i use that term loosely) were trying to accomplish, not what they failed to accomplish. So if your looking for this story well told ya have to keep waiting, cause it aint been done yet.
  Now however Mel Gibson has come thru big with ""The Passion"", and you can bet Hollywood sees the dollar signs. So there is hope for this great story.",1078185600,8,2021,4.795389048991354
634771,4,6303382347,"If you have read the Left Behind book series, you know they are not only entertaining, but true to scripture.  They could well serve as a survival guide for the tribulation.  This movie holds true to the book with a few exceptions.  The time-line is shifted around a bit, but I think it works better that way in a movie format.  There are obvious omissions due to time constraints, but nothing that changes the story's message.  This was the first film of Kirk Cameron's I have seen since his Growing Pains days, and he has certainly matured as an actor.  Overall, this was a very entertaining and moving picture; a must for movie-lovers who like to see some Christian values on the silver screen every once in a while.",1077840000,,719,4.534883720930233
634772,2,6303382347,"Made for video but given a brief, unsuccessful theatrical release, ""Left Behind-The Movie"" is based on the first of Tim LeHaye and Jerry Jenkins' popular novels fictionalizing events from the New Testament's Book of Revelation.
The title refers to those earthly inhabitants who remain inhabitants of earth following the Rapture, an event many Christians believe is foretold in Bible prophecy, notably in I Thessalonians 4:16-17 which reads, ""For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God, and the dead in Christ shall rise first. Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air, and so shall we be with the Lord.""
Regardless of one's beliefs, this movie has neither the budget nor the talent to properly depict the aftermath of this event with any credibility or power. The devastation that occurs after planes without pilots and cars without drivers crash and burn is only referred to, not shown. Instead we get shots of dogs without owners, and worried looks on the faces of those (cue the ominous music) LEFT BEHIND! Imagine what Spielberg, working with a bigger budget, could do with this scenario if so inclined!
Instead of Harrison Ford or Tom Cruise, we get former teen idol Kirk Cameron as our hero, a reporter named (I'm not kidding) Buck Williams. Suddenly hip to what's happening, Buck forms the Tribulation Force to oppose the Antichrist, who in LeHaye and Jenkins' tale is named (I'm still not kidding) Nicolae Carpathia. If that name isn't a dead giveaway to his villainy, Gordon Currie's suavely saturnine approach to the role should clue you in.
But the film's biggest flaw is not its mediocre presentation, but its content. I don't doubt the producers' sincerity, but in their zeal to reach as wide an audience as possible they seem to have compromised their beliefs. The Lord referred to in Thessolonians (and throughout the New Testament) is Jesus Christ whom John 14:6 quotes as saying, ""I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father but by me."" But Jesus is conspicuosly left behind in this movie. Characters, including a minister, speak of, and to, ""God,"" but the deity is referred to only in the most generic way possible as if the filmmakers fear alienating any viewer who worships at a competing altar.
The filmmakers may be devout Christians, but the courage of their convictions never made it to celluloid. This is one time when it really is better to read the book. No, not ""Left Behind"" - The Bible.",1077148800,7,2583,4.79372197309417

The film starts out as occasionally interesting - if something of a straight steal from King's The Langoliers at times. But continues beyond reality.
The reaction to the missing is simply not credible - and an viewpoint that happily sits the antichrist at the UN confirming the views of extremists is simply distasteful and rather scary in a world where some remember that there are fanatics in every religion.
As a film is fails miserably. Nothing to do with funding - everything to do with the creative input.

Well, all I can tell you is I find it highly amusing if people are really using this B rate movie to preach salvation.  LOL!  I guess if you want a movie version of sitting at Sunday church that's great, but if you actually want some entertainment don't expect to find it here.
It could have been so much better -- the concept of going through an apocolyptic time where souls are in the balance is compelling.  The story of the last days of man, of the rise of the Antichrist, of the Tribulation Saints who fight against the coming evil, the tragedy of those otherwise good souls that are lost before they accept Christ.  That makes for some intrigue, some drama, some entertainment!  That is what the books convey, but this movie does not.  All in all I was quite disappointed.",1075420800,2,1267,4.530701754385965

634818,1,6303382347,"I watched this movie last night and was not surprised of its content.  The first point that must be made is that the only scriptural information in the movie is that Jesus is our salvation.  But concerning the eschatology of the movie, there was NO biblical accuracy.  It was sensationalism, making for great fiction, but it had no biblical support.  As a radio announcer once said, it's fine if you want to read (watch) something like, say, Buck Rogers.  But I think it needs to be changed to Star Wars (see below).
I highly recommend that before one falls for the teaching of these and subsequent movies, and for any of the teaching of the books, and other movies and books by other authors that present the same basic eisegeted interpretation, that they read something like ""Last Days Madness"" by Gary Demar.
Finally, how amused I was to find Star Wars in the movie.  That's right.  Nicolae stands in a meeting at the UN, and being the antichrist (which in the Bible is not a specific person and is not the man of sin), and he murders two people.  Then, twice at least, he speaks to the group and waves his hand while he speaks.  Everyone (except for the one believer there, the Christian Jedi if you will), starts thinking what he says, not realizing that he inserted his thoughts into their minds and removed the truth from them.
And so I thought back to Star Wars in the 70's, when Obiwan waves his hand at the Imperial guards and does the exact same thing.
For those who realize the total fallacy of this movie and the related books, stand firm.  For those who have bought into it, take off the blinders and do some more study from alternate views.  If you remain a ""Left Behind"" theologian, either after studying or because you refuse to consider something besides the teaching of the Left Behind magesterium, then may the Force be with you.",1068595200,18,1849,4.539156626506024

In the meantime, several countries have agreed to unite their official currency with the United Kingdom. For different personal reasons, the news reporter who witnessed the aforementioned phenomenon in Israel (Kirk Cameron) and an extramarital-affair-having airplane pilot (Brad Johnson) realize the Rapture has come upon the world. Since they cannot stop the antichrist from converting most of the world's population, they become born again, and commit themselves to the Lord for the 7-year period that the Antichrist will rule the world.
The premise is intriguing and the execution is decent. However, the acting is weak and the message fails to convince a large amount of non-Christians about the end of the world. Most importantly, the film is theologically flawed. For further note, the soft Christian rock portions of the soundtrack slightly ruin suspenseful credibility in more intense scenes.
If you like this film, I also recommend ""The Omega Code"" and ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"".

This movie on the other hand is a joke. Bad acting, bad scripts, bad production. Cheesy music, and it reminds me of a Lifetime special. I really wish the film followed the book better. They left out alot of important details, and summed a 500 plus page book into a 90 minute film. Talk about pushing the envelope. I think the film would have done much better without actors from the Mickey Mouse Club and stuck with better scripts. There are a few good points in the movie, such as when Rayford Steele notices his wife gone, he totally ruled that scene. Great job on that one. Nicolae looks like a choir boy, but once again, the innocent can fool people. I think the film would have been more exciting had they included a more ""orchestrated"" music piece. They stuck with Newsboys and all of those other Christian pop bands that sing pretty and try to be cool (no offense to the newsboys, but yeah). It shuts the film down completely and makes it seem like a pop teen flick.
The story is good, and it is surprising how accurate some of that interpretation was by the authors. Only if they knew that Revelation would soon be unravelling in real life after they wrote that book.
The film leaves alot to be desired by the viewer. The first time that I had viewed it, I had felt empty because I was expecting more. That 90 minutes went way too fast and it didn't hardly touch the magic that the written novel had.
So if you're a fan of the book, it might be a good idea to skip this one if you don't want to be terribly disappointed. Once again, great book, poor movie. Most transcriptions from book to movie are poor in the first place, but alot of this gibberish is unexcuseable.

No arguments, we just bought it as we loved the books. It's a good film, not badly acted - bit dodgy on the special effects, but . . . Well right from the off you notice the differences. Buck is a TV journalist, most of the action takes place in the US, with no proper European/UK scenes. Chloe's story-line is all wrong etc etc . . . Things happen in the book as they don't happen in the film. I think it was the director who said - in the extras - that they felt the weight of expectation due to the fact that so many had read the book/series. Maybe so, but it didn't stop him or the writers & producers producing a sadly lacking movie with little or no relevance to the book, except maybe in the character names. I'm not gonna buy the Trib Force movie, as I can only imagine what they've done to that one(!)",1045699200,,989,4.051020408163265

The movie itself does appear rather cheap. The airplanes look a little too obviously CGI. The sets aren't primo. But for a smaller movie company like this one, it was alright.
My main beef with the movie is this. They failed to present the Gospel message of Jesus Christ (the whole FOCAL point of Tim LaHaye/Jerry Jenkins' novels) in a clear and concise manner. Jesus Christ's name was mentioned, by my count, once. Not good, not good. The operative words are ""faith"" and ""God"". Both key words, but none are more key than Jesus. The only Way is through God's Son Jesus, and this movie doesn't make that clear enough.

634927,4,6303382347,"Based on the best-selling book of the same title, ""Left Behind"" looks at the events of the rapture which is told in the book of Revelation.  The movie centers around the lives of Buck Williams, played by Kirk Cameron, and Rayford Steele, played by Brad Johnson.  Rayford is a commerical airline pilot on his way from New York to London, and Buck is a reporter for GNN, a world-wide news agency, who happens to be on Rayford's flight.  Suddenly, people begin to turn up missing.  All that is left is their clothes, jewelry, etc.  No trace of the people can be found.
After landing at O'Hare in Chicago, Rayford learns the sad fact that his wife and son are part of the missing.  Rayford often felt strange when his wife was talking about events in the Bible, but now he's wondering if she had been right about things.  He finally begins to read his wife's Bible, and soon he realizes the truth; the rapture has indeed occured.  Still filled with grief, Rayford, along with Bruce Barnes, the assistant pastor of the local church who was also left behind, both accept Christ into their lives.
Meanwhile, Nicolae Carpathia, played by Gordon Currie, has taken control of the United Nations and has promised to restore world order.  Many see him as a savior, but Bruce and some others know him for who he really is.  Buck has been witnessed to by Rayford and Bruce, but he still has some doubts.  He is summoned to the United Nations to cover a Carpathia press conference and he then discovers that everything Bruce and Rayford had been telling him is true.  He then accepts God into his life.  Nicolae manages to brainwash everyone at the press conference except for Buck, who knows the real truth of what really happened.

634930,4,6303382347,"Left Behind, the first film in the Left Behind saga, is a promising beginning to the series, blending action and suspense with the Gospel message, also providing insights into Bible prophecy and the end-times of planet Earth. Great plot structure, well-developed characters, and a convincing cast make Left Behind: The Movie a film worth seeing.
Left Behind opens with this saying: ""How does one describe both a beginning and an end? We should have known better, but we didn't. What does it matter what we think we know? In the end, there's no denying the Truth."" That saying perfectly sets the tone for the entire movie, and, without a doubt, for the entire series.
The storyline concerns four individuals who acknowledge Jesus with their lips, but in truth they don't believe in the Gospel message of God's salvation. Then, the most catastrophic event in the history of mankind occurs: millions of people all over the world have vanished; disappeared in the twinkling of an eye, all at the exact same moment. World-wide chaos, anarchy, and devastation strike the planet. Those who remain on Earth find themselves desperately seeking for answers. Among them, the four non-believers, Cameron ""Buck"" Williams (Kirk Cameron) airline pilot Rayford Steele (Brad Johnson) his daughter, Chloe Steele (Janaya Stephens) and Bruce Barnes (Clarance Gilyard).
The four of them eventually meet up with each other in the midst of their searching for the truth behind the vanishings. Together they discover the Truth: God Almighty took His followers to Heaven to live with Him forever. The four left-behinds become post-rapture Christians dedicated to live for Christ, and preparing themselves to try to survive the most chaotic and deadly years the planet has ever known: the final seven years of Earth, known as the Tribulation . . .
As said before, Left Behind is a film definitely worth seeing. The one minor quibble is this: Director Vic Sarin, in creating this movie, has attempted to seamlessly blend action and suspense with the Gospel message. However, the blend of action/suspense and the Gospel message is not seamless. To me, it is part action flick, and part religious message. The film would have been better if the blend had been more seamless. The second film in the series, Tribulation Force, is better in this respect. However, I can still wholeheartedly reccomend both films to anyone who loves all-around good films.",1044057600,,2422,5.0879396984924625

If the people behind this movie wanted to get people to watch it they should have hired better writers, production team, director and a major studio to produce. The books were written for non-Christians and Christians a like. But the movie was made by Christians for Christians(which I am one, but I hated this movie).

I insist that you read the book if you haven't already seen the movie. Of course if you are not familiar with the rapture or don't consider yourself a Christian it would be very difficult for you to find interest in the book or movie. The story does require an open mind and faith. If you read the book Left Behind and find it interesting you will soon discover that you will be tempted to read the rest of the series. You will also notice that with every book you will learn more about the bible.

It was not just a normal Christian book, it was an entertaining novel with interesting characters on the brink of the end of the world. The book had everything the mass market wanted: sex and violence. This film takes the book and deletes the exciting qualities and changes it to create a nonviolent, preachy flick that could only appeal to the most hardcore in the Christian subculture. It is an abomination and embarrasment to its source novel. Where the book appealed to everyone, this film only targets those born-again Christian fanatics that want to watch this kind of stuff. The violence is kept to a minimum, something the book didn't do. There is no sexual content, something the book had. Most of all, there is Kirk Cameron, a mild actor who does better on syndicated sitcoms than in what is supposed to be an action-drama. He plays Buck Williams who is a reporter who gets left behind and soon he converts to Christ because he'll follow Satan if he doesn't, or at least that's what this movie wants us to believe. This film is constantly on its soapbox, never pausing to develop any sort of coherent story or characters to care for. At the end of the film, Kirk Cameron suggests, almost begs, for the viewer to recommend this film to friends and make posters and pamphlets getting people to watch this.

The Cinematography. I have never--never encountered a movie with worse cinematography. You have a hard time making out the faces of people at a distance in this film. Even some close-ups are fuzzy. While I do not feel the Left Behind books or the movie are in any way suitable as apologetics, I know some of the folks on this project believed it could be used as one. How sad that those who would represent God would do such a poor job of movie making.
The acting. Kirk Cameron stands head and shoulders above the rest of the cast here...enough said.
The story. I have written about the Left Behind series elsewhere on Amazon. The first book was actually ok. The later ones continued to degenerate as the writing and theology got progressively worse. The movie starts out with bad screen writing and bad theology. This could have been a decent movie. But movies are usually worse than the books they are based off of.

Unfortunately, there's very little in this film to commend it to viewers. The book has been gutted to fit it into a neat, 90-minute package, though the changes in plot flow fairly well. The biggest problem is that Left Behind never generates much excitement or interest. You never really care about the characters, and what they're doing on-screen is never all that interesting. The four leads are coming to grips with their physical and spiritual fates, while preparing to do battle with the ultimate evil -- but the tone doesn't appear vastly different from our own daily lives.

'The Cross and the Switchblade' stunk mainly due to it's unbeliveability).
The 'Left Behind' series of books do just that. I haven't read one yet where I didn't want to finish it. The pacing is as good as any other contemporary writers, and the lack of profanity and explicit imagery (which I previously thought were necessary to a good thriller) doesn't take away from it at all.
Which is why it's so gut-wrenchingly sad to see the film adaptation come out like a bad USA cable movie. I suppose the industry will need to take some time to develop, but I really wish they wouldn't tout stuff like this as good examples of Christian filmmaking. And by the way, Kirk Cameron still cannot act. Nor should he be paid to.
You need an actor who can say 'Nicolae' and make the audience wonder if they should even be there, it scares them so much. These are the end times: people ought to be, well, wetting themselves to the point that they want to rush straight to church and accept Christ.

It is narratively tight and faithful to the feel of the source novel.  Some of the casting did seem odd, especially comedic actor Kirk Cameron, who seems a bit uncomfortable as investigative reporter Buck Williams at times.  Brad Johnson grew into the role of Rayford Steele quite nicely, although he seemed a tad young for the part.  The offbeat surprise was Clarence Gilyard (Walker, Texas Ranger) as the left behind pastor.  He gives his big scene a personal dramatic weight that the rest of the movie needed.  If Cloud Nine and/or Namesake Productions choose to produce the next book in the series I hope and pray that Mr. Gilyard gets more screen time.
The movie, like the source novel, spends less time on the spiritual/personal belief ramifications of a pre-tribulation rapture and more on the political/conspiracy story line.  A more intimate look at these earth shattering events would have been nice, but that is a pretty minor quibble.  The big one is how the movie ends just as the story seems to be getting started.  Not at all surprising considering the source material was the first book in a projected TWELVE book series, but disappointing still (it's a good sign when you don't want a story to end).

I was excited about seeing Christian movies that could compete with major picture studios.  Sadly, I think we still have a long way to go.  The visual effects and acting were acceptable (though Rayford's ""coming to Christ"" scene was WAY too weepy).  The real problem was the adaptation of the screenplay.  I wish this had been developed a little further.  Still, the Christian community should be proud of these efforts because they are showing that someday we will be able to compete with Hollywood.

635321,3,6303382347,"""In the beginning... it's a little late for that.""
Growing Pains star Kirk Cameron plays Buck Williams in the film adaption of the Jerry B. Jenkins/Tim LaHaye novel, Left Behind which focuses upon the oncoming events during the rapture, in which the Antichrist will be born, and unite ten kingdoms.  Brad Johnson plays Rayford Steele, a husband and father who's wife has been trying to teach him the word of God for years, but he's always ignored her.  After millions of people disappear in a blink-of-an-eye vanish, which includes his son and wife, Rayford and his daughter unite with a fallen priest and Buck to try and survive the very destructive future which they are promised to face.
In a film skipping the theatrical release first in order, and going to video first, then to theaters, we realize that this film wants to get some attention.  The film seemed to be totally blown off at the box office, and little credibility was given, but as far as it has gone, it is passable.  I've never read any of the novels, because I'm not one who can just sit back and read, but I'd say that this film has a lot to show, given such a small budget, and no major actors.
The film opens in the cities, and we sort of gander upon the world today.  We then head to a crop field where Buck and a foreign stand, (Buck being a reporter interviewing him) and all of a sudden planes start crashing and exploding in the air.  This is one of the signs to the earth's destruction, in which God returns to save all of his Christian followers, and leaves the rapture to those who've turned away from him.  So... the visual effects aren't top order, they are credible.
There is a lot put into the acting though.  Kirk Cameron and Brad Johnson are great everyday people put into the position of being caught in a world of darkness.  Because of all the children and a select few of adult people having been gone, Antichrist, Nicolae Carpathia comes to the decision of radiation having killed them off.  The world is in complete chaos!  People dying and hurt everywhere.  In so happening, they are searching for a leader, someone to guide them through these times- Nicolae calls upon himself.
Many readers who've followed the book of Revelation can comply with the film, but those who have no clue of the bible may be totally clueless.  yet, this is a great discipling tool for non-christians- looking for an answer that can be put into 21st Century terms.
Director Vic Sarin has an imaginative appeal to create this film.  He mixes human emotion and explosive trauma to create this disaster film smuthered in cheapness and with a low balance of creativeness.  This proving- that most of the time- the novel is much better than the film.  Yet, with great characters we can relate to, and smooth charisma to show something of itself, toppled with bumpy advertising, releasing, and budget- the film does the very best it can to be an everyday motion picture.  Maybe if Touchstone or Dreamworks or 20th Century Fox had released it would have 10 times the sharpness, but with the small Cloud Ten Pictures production company, it can't deliver a whole lot.
Left Behind, which I hope is followed with a string of sequels that follow the books, is thunderdome entertainment filled with good performances and story, but presented in such a street trash manner, may intrigue some audiences, but bore others.  It is a great discipling tool and good film to see, which I'm sure many will enjoy, but if only a larger production company would distribute it, it would get the praise it deserves.  Check this film out for a thought-provoking trip.
Even though it isn't listed on the cover, the MPAA rated this film a PG-13, a rating it really didn't deserve- a PG I'd say.  But the reason is for Some Violence.",1004918400,2,3773,4.619760479041916

Then, ONLY when looking at the Special Features ""making of"" commentary, did I learn that the movie was an engine of a ""Christian"" filmmaking company and like-minded souls to serve the propagation of a Christian, faith-based message.
I respect Christians and Christianity.  Each to his or her own.  But I resented the misleading packaging of this film.  Not a word appeared on the jacket as to the Christian genesis of this opus.  Nor was the movie that good either.  But at least the ""making of"" piece was candidly honest as to the movie's motivations, and did portray an honest and even engaging effort by a non-Hollywood, likely shoestrings outfit to put together a worthwhile film.

The novels really aren't so much more than pedestrian fiction but the basic message is important regardless of your theological position. What makes this movie so frustrating to me is the fact that the script is so poorly developed and the characters are simply left undeveloped. I felt no empathy for the characters and that's a failure of the director and screenwriter. In a situation like these characters are in, empathy is writers' the strongest tool.
The biggest failure of this film is that the directors' hackneyed attempt at filmmaking distracts from and undermines the essential message of the books. Knowing that anyone who had not read the series would be totally lost by the end of the film, I was just saddened.
People who have criticized the actors are not really being fair. There are way more credible things to criticize. I am glad to hear that LaHaye and Jenkins were disappointed with this film.

Now, don't get me wrong, the message of the story is there.  However, do either of us read Christian novels or see Christian movies merely for the message?  Might as well forget about books and movies and go straight to the Gospels.
Almost everything that made the book stand out in the annuls of Christian Fiction is noticably lacking in this movie.  Captain Steele's long time struggling on a diplomatic method of converting those left: gone.  The sweet shyness between Buck and Chloe before things take off for them?  Gone.  In fact, on this last note, we get the feeling they're already together!

So, I was interested to see how Cloud Ten Pictures would adapt the novel. Alas, this is a boring, unclear and badly-acted movie that never generates interest or suspense. Now, some may say the book is too big, I say this is a wrong assumption because longer movies have been made from shorter novels and have come out really bad.

I think the problem with this movie is the same I see with most Cloud Ten Productions, these guys don't care about making serious movies, they just show their desperation in trying to compete with the big-budget studio pictures. And they can't because I have seen that all their movies care less about really exploring Biblical themes and more about shoot-outs and cheesy special effects. Secular films like ""The Exorcist"" and even ""Stigmata"" seem like more serious undertakings (and they are. ""The Exorcist"" being a masterpiece). In fact, I viewed ""The Making Of Left Behind"" and was disappointed to hear an air-headed producer exclaim, ""if there isn't an explosion, then it's not a movie,"" how stupid is that? Now for examining the movie's content as a whole: This movie is never clear or focused. People who know nothing about Christian theology as taught in groups like Catholics, Baptists etc., will walk out of this movie confused, having not really learned anything. The acting is lame, when the actors are not unconvincing, they are over-acting. This is also a boring movie, which seems much longer than it is. A lot of the good stuff from the book was cut out, like the forming romance between the reporter and pilot's daughter. And it lacks the epic tones the novel deserves. If Cloud Ten really wants to make a name for itself, then they better start thinking harder. Another example of their lack of thought is that they released this movie on video BEFORE releasing it in theaters where it didn't even make the top 10. I really don't keep track of religious-based movies or books, but I was recommended the ""Left Behind"" novel by a friend and I know a good story when I see one, and this is a good story that still is searching for a proper screen adaptation.",996796800,8,2535,4.72234762979684

The answer was simple....I had already read the books....it's just like any book that is turned into a movie...things get slightly changed and shifted around.  If I hadn't already read the books, I do believe I would have completely enjoyed it, as did everyone I have spoken to who has seen it without reading the series.

The Second Coming (or the First Coming, depending on your religious views) is a central event to a big portion of the world's populace and thus prime fodder for movies.  From the various cinematic versions of ""Ben Hur"" to the ""Omen"" and its sequels, the interpretive dramatic events surrounding the anticipated (or feared) appearance of the Messiah has drawn large audiences.  The subject works best when there's a central, accessible character and a story that stands on its own.  LEFT BEHIND is a mutant phenomenon that slipped under the radar but impacted the secular, commercial marketplace.  First part of an evangelical best-selling series of books by Tim LaHaye and Jerry Jenkins, then a direct-to-video release and then, a limited theatrical release.  This is a stupendously badly acted, written and directed sermon that is squarely aimed at the choir.  Based on a controversial interpretation of scripture not shared by all Christians, this story posits a prophetic sequence of events that includes a ""secret rapture"" when all true believers will be bodily lifted from the planet.  Per this interpretation, all those remaining on earth will endure seven years of trouble and tribulation unlike anything in history until Satan and his followers are destroyed and the earth is made new.  But nothing could be as bad as having to sit through this pathetic joke of a movie.  If you still think this end-times genre fiasco is something to see, please note that Kirk Cameron stars as a hard-hitting middle-eastern journalist.

The basic problem is not the plot (of the movie or the series of books), since the idea of developing a whole story of what happens after the ""rapture"" is fairly original. Rather the problem lies precisely with the attitudes the movie tries to stroke, i.e. the attitudes of those ""Christians"" living before the rapture.
Some of these attitudes reflect a basically conspiritorial view of all international bodies, and indeed anything that is not whitebread American. I was waiting for someone to mention the ""Tri-Lateral Commission.""
More distressing still is the idea that ""believers"" will be willing and able to escape all the bad times of the post-rapture period, and would leave behind relatives and other loved ones.

It takes a literal view of biblical content about the end of the world, a lot of which can be found in Revelation and some in Daniel, and I'm sure there is some in other books as well.  The point is, as movie adaptations go, this certainly isn't the best around.  There are a fewminor little details here and there they left out, mostly for creative reasons no doubt.  Some things that work on paper just don't cut it on film, and so liberties must be taken.  If you are a fan of the series of books, give this a try.

I think, however, those who took care in their words had a sense of who God really is and why this movie was made.
I have read all the books thus far, and while I found some to be quite rushed in tone, I found their foundation to facts were based on biblical events. Hence my decision to venture the movie. After viewing the movie I was left a bit disappointed, not because it didn't stay true to the book, but because many of the events were rushed and many more were left out. The first movie should have taken the time the book did in development of the characters. It was confusing to see characters become very familiar with each other only after just meeting. Buck did not get Hattie her position in the Carpathian empire until much later after the disapperance. At the end of the movie, Buck returns to Chicago to the church where he first met Bruce not to the house as was previously suggested by another reviewer. The first book ended with Buck and the rest of the Tribulation Force meeting at the airport,walking through the terminal, thus preparing for the biggest battle yet to come. Suspenseful! I only wish the movie had such an ending, then the desire for a sequel would be much greater. Maybe next time. Kirk Cameron, a true believer, was quite believable as the mild-mannered reporter, Buck. His wife, Chelsea, made the perfect Hattie and Brad Johnson as Rayford Steele was compelling.
Yes the movie leaves you incomplete if you have read the books, but it is a beginning and hopefully a catalycst to provoking thought about the future.

There is hardly any of the building of the personalities of the characters that there was in the book.  The movie is a good movie. Your whole family can watch this. If you have children there it movie is a great way to encourage them to read the books.  I really liked the casting of 3 charcters in particular. The actor chosen to play Nicolae was a great choice. He looks so innocent and doesn't fit anything you would imagine the bad guy to look like. The actor draws you in and convinces you he is just who & what he says he is. Kirk Cameron as Buck, one of the main characters is fantastic. If you have read the book, he plays the character Buck just as you would think Buck would be like. Kirk Camerons wife, that plays the charcter hattie is terrific. This is a movie I would reccomend you buy.

The goal of this film is neither entertainment nor to make a pleasant evening for a couple but to shake the people that the second coming of Christ is closer than many of them thinking about ... Therefore that is absolutelly bad approache to criticize the film that e.g. the Israeli War - Scene is not overcomputerized etc. This movie tried to express the feelings of those guys who really left behind.

636005,1,6303382347,"The Movie: * (1 star for its poor quality storytelling)
 The Book: **** (4 stars for its enjoyment and message)
Why do screenwriters so often seem to be unable to transpose a work of fiction from the written medium to the big screen? Many argue that it's necessary in order to fit so much detail into a two hour movie. The fact that many larger novels have successfully been adapted to the big screen certainly doesn't help to explain why such a light book [Left Behind] was so poorly crammed into a one and a half hour presentation.
By no means will I claim Left Behind is some sort of masterpiece from a literary standpoint, but I will say it was a great read. The movie on the otherhand was rather disappointing. I won't say I was disappointed because of the poor special effects, bad acting, or even poor directing (though this film has all three). I went in expecting it. I will say I was disappointed because the story just wasn't there.
There are many differences between the book and the movie; some small, some large. A few small examples are: Rayford kissing Hattie (leading you to assume he's having an affair; Buck never going to the UK; etc.. Some of the big examples are: the book starts on Rayfords flight about one hour before the disappearances (chapter 1) while the movie doesn't even reach chapter one until at least 20 minutes into the film (that's pretty big considering the film is only 90 minutes long); in the movie all four main characters conveniently know each other before hand; Carpathia is portrayed as a sinister individual pretty early completely detracting from the point that the false prophet will be someone everyone loves and trusts; the book never makes mention of these mysterious 10 tracks of land or bankrupting the U.N.; everyone jumps on the believer bandwagon pretty much instantly without any inner conflict; I could go on..
My point is that the book makes a good dramatazation of what life might be like after the rapture (if it indeed happens the way it's presented). The writers do a good job at presenting various psychologies and creating fictional testimonies. The people in this book (believers and non-believers alike) seem real and believable. The events (so far) stay consistant with those found in the bible (even though the rapture is a vague concept to begin with and much debated). But the movie doesn't capture the message of the book. It is chopped up and brief. The characters are two dimensional with no appearant motivations. The villans/conflicts seem to exist with no reason/explanation. I can't see how watching this film without having read the book would allow you to take much away from it.
If you read the book, you'll probably really enjoy it (unless you let the whole christian thing get in your way, in which case you probably wouldn't read it in the first place). After that if you're like me you'll want to see the movie just out of curiosity. If you do this, you'll at least be able to fill in a lot of the missing parts with what you know from the book (even if you are annoyed by how much they really did unnecessarily change the story around).",982886400,8,3123,4.657608695652174

636180,1,6303382347,"Rapture and Tribulation theology came into vogue in the 19th century, the product of a few select passages of ancient scripture, mostly metaphorical, taken out of their ancient context and pieced together in such a way that the self-righteous can believe they're better than everybody else. This theology is at the heart of the movie Left Behind. It is anachronism at its most sinister, and I'm one of the majority of Christians who just don't believe it.
Jesus, the focus of Christianity, is barely mentioned in Left Behind, and when he is, there is no mention of who he was or of anything he ever said or did. His name is invoked as the one ""to believe in,"" but what is made most clear in this movie is the authors' conviction that every word in the Bible is literally factual, and that those who don't believe this are condemned by God. Scholars today call this ""bibliolatry"" -- the worshipping of the Bible as the literal words of God.
But the Bible was written over a period of thousands of years by hundreds of different human beings. It is not a history book, and it is not a rulebook. It is the epic story of monotheism. It contains much that is true, that is, truths about life as seen through the eyes of those inspired by God throughout the past few millennia. Whether this or that passage is journalistically factual is irrelevant.
Many, many of its stories (including most of the passages quoted in this movie) are apocalyptic -- a type of metaphorical literature that flourished in the Middle East two to three thousand years ago, but that Western culture does not have the mindset to understand. Apocalyptic literature does not predict the future; it was a style of writing meant to give hope to an oppressed culture.
Never mind the neat special effects, the twists of plot, and all the other things our present-day Western culture enjoys in a good movie. The backbone of this project was broken to begin with.
As Madeleine L'Engle once said, ""I take the Bible far too seriously to take it literally."" A literal reading of the Bible produces an image of God as a vengeful, angry, immature, temper-tantrum-throwing creator who can't wait to punish those who have broken his black-and-white rules. I, for one, just can't believe that. I believe, rather, what Jesus said time and time again about getting your priorities straight. Love is the way of the universe -- and what is love? Letting go of fear and doing good for others in this wonderful universe God has created. The universe will be here long after the human race is gone, and it's still all good.

636185,1,6303382347,"I watched ""Left Behind"" when it came out on video in October, and it probably should have stayed on video rather than try to make a theater debut. As a Christian, I was offended by the final scene of the movie, in which Buck Williams seems to question the validity of the Bible's account of the end times, which may prevent non-Christians who watch this movie from accepting Jesus Christ or the Bible since they too may question the validity of scripture. Also, I thought that the characters seemed to be a little unsure of their salvation through faith in Jesus Christ, and seemed to regret not believing in Him before the rapture.
I also thought the acting was rather poor because the actors didn't do a very convincing job of portraying the characters from the books. Even Kirk Cameron, who brought a natural curiosity to the role of Buck Williams, seemed to not bring much depth to the role other than when he was reporting the news.
Overall, I thought that this was a movie more suitable for the junior high school church youth group or the 5th grade Sunday School class rather than an adult audience, because the film somehow neglected to explain the end times in Revelation on an adult level, and failed to truly make non-Christians think about what might happen if they are ""Left Behind.""",981936000,3,1296,4.639130434782609

There's nothing special about them at all.  Even ""Battlefield Earth"" looks like Oscar material next to this befuddled mess of a movie.
There are a number of rave reviews for ""Left Behind"" on this site.

One would be well-advised to ignore the hype.  If you still want to view this movie, I recommend renting a VHS copy as a less expensive alternative to the cost of a movie ticket.
""Left Behind"" is not only the title of the movie, it describes what those thinking of buying it should do...leave it behind!

I am what some may call a ""conservative, evangelical Christian"", but I like to think that I cannot be pigeon holed into a view of Scripture that is ""obvious"".  Why do I say this?  Well, my first problem with the movie is the theology: it is simply unbiblical and dangerous.  I challenge anyone to give a good, clear description of how the rapture and all that goes along with it are what the Bible says.  Where does it say that all the Christians will be ""snatched"" away to leave those who are ""Left Behind"" to suffer the wrath of God.  And to what purpose?  Have they already not been punished for being Left Behind?  Jesus asks, ""When the Son of Man comes, will he find faith on earth?"" - why ask this if he knows that no one who is Christian is there?  Rapture theology is dangerous by being a new fear tactic of spreading the gospel and, well...bad theology!
On to other things...the acting, as many have said, is atrocious, though true to writing style of the book.  Cameron is probably the best, though that should be expected, given that he has the most experience.
The movie plods along and is virtually unbearable to watch - and I am glad that I only saw it in video format.  If I paid a big-screen price, I would want my money back!
Now many Christians who read this will think badly of me for being so negative; but if the movie is so good, why are Cloud Ten Productions trying to get churches to put up money to get this movie on the screen?  If it is so good, why can't it stand on its own?

First off, if you read the book, the scene where Nicolae Carpathia does his devious deed (I'm won't give away anything)...the movie took away a few parts and even CHANGED a few!! There was a lot taken out. One good thing about it is that the movie will give you a good look at what the people look like for your mental picture as you read the book. I suggest that you watch the movie, then read the book.
Second, One of the main part of the book, the part where Rayford talks to Hattie in a mall-resturaunt kinda place about his thoughts for her (sinful thoughts), well that was taken out. cuz that happens 1/2 way through the book. Chloe doen't even meet ""Buck"" until then. It was a rather comical scene in the book. Why they took it out is beyond me.
One GOOD thing (There are ALOT of good things about the movie) is that the characters act like they do in the book, which is a big PLUS...:)

636367,2,6303382347,"I had not read the book series since I am not into conspiracy theories and end-times predictions. I got too much of that stuff in the pentecostal church where I grew up where everything technological was either of the devil or would usher in the antichrist and we were so rapture and heavenly minded that we were not prepared to be earthly good, Great Commission fulfilling Christians. However, at the pleading from a fellow brother in Christ, I borrowed his copy of this movie and watched it. After viewing numerous commercials from other Apocalyptic, rapture movies from Cloud Ten pictures (remember, it was their leaders Peter and Paul Lalonde that went Y2K crazy a year and a half ago. Also another of their conspiracy theory, antichrist of the week predicting buddies Jack and Rexella Van Impe was briefly in the movie on the airplane. I noticed that they did not get left behind in the rapture scene.), I found it hard to watch this movie because every scene filmed inside of a building looked too blurry and too dark on my home theater (also the scene w/ Nicolae killing the two gentlemen appeared very choppy and re-patch-edited over and over again) while scenes filmed outside with natural sunlight looked ok. Also, many of the scenes did not blend in together in natural progression. I had to call up a friend who had read the book to tell me what was going on that the producers left out. Therefore, much of this movie relys on one reading the book in order to know the inside information and the behind the scenes happenings to understand this book. The special effects were not special, with the jets blowing up reminded me of a 1980's video game. I wondered how many airplanes flew over Israel at one time. We did not fly as many over Iraq in Desert Storm. This movie had the quality of a Sunday night made for TV murder movie. Kirk Cameron lacked the enthusiasm and did not show enough emotion to make his role convincing along with the stiffness of the airplane pilot. Chelsea Noble and Clarence Gilyard did decent but Nicolae looked too boyish and immature as the Antichrist.
This movie does take a pre-trib approach that may offend some theologians and the guys at Cloud Ten had to briefly bring up a scene of interpreting some cryptic letters on a computer screen as a ""Bible Code"" that could only be interpreted by the pastor, another controversial and near gnostic concept. Also, there was way too much emphasis on the verse of ""two men walking side by side, one raptured, one left behind"" as everybody that was left behind was with someone who was raptured, plus all the children was raptured which now brings up issues of spiritual accountability. It's a lot better than The Omega Code (aka Mega Crap) in production quality and in theology, and is a natural progression towards better Christian filmmaking that needs to take place. However, I was suprised that Mr. LaHaye's and Mr. Jenkins's names do not appear in the movie credits nor on the packaging. I now question the stragety of releasing the movie to videotape before the theater. If you have seen it once on tape, why go re-see it again on the big screen.",980553600,3,3137,4.664259927797834

The result is mass confusion as driverless vehicles careen out of control, pilotless planes crash to the ground, fires and explosions roar unhindered, and worldwide delirium breaks loose. You're immobilized with terror as you watch in total incredulity at a insane world thrust into an apocalyptic nightmare from which it will never awaken... You've been Left Behind.

636372,1,6303382347,"Perhaps I am missing something.  As a Christian, I have always been taught that evangelism is all about spreading the GOOD news; rather than scaring people into faith, Christians should embrace others into the faith.  More to the point, however, as a film, ""Left Behind"" is sorely lacking in the most important department:  art.  Film should be art, not tripe.  As soon as Christian filmmakers realize this, perhaps we shall find more deeply moving films.  As to the biblical support for the ideals of the ""rapture,"" I must mention (with a strong fear of casting pearls to swine) there is very little, if any.  For instance, the only place in the New Testament where there is any sort of mention of an ""antichrist"" is in 1 John.  In the original Greek, there is no disputing that the author is speaking of more than one antichrist living at his time.  His purpose is to distinguish those who were orthodox (those in the light) from those who had become heretics (those in the darkness).  Finally, I refuse to believe in a God who would take his Church away from those who are in such great need of it, as this ""rapture"" clearly portrays; am I the only one who was disturbed by the scenes of strife in the film after all the ""righteous"" had been taken up?  I have seen that picture before--that is what life is like without God.  I recommend films of better character which have a deeper message, such as ""Elmer Gantry,"" ""The Poseidon Adventure,"" and ""E.T.""",980380800,24,1456,4.60077519379845

The single flaw I find in this movie is that the message of salvation is weak.  The very core of the message is watered down.  It is not incorrect but I beleive it is incomplete.

I highly recommend both the movie and the books to EVERYONE!

Anyone who hasn't read the books needs to do so.  They are straight from the Bible and can help even the most novice of Biblical followers.

636466,2,6303382347,"There's no question that ""Left Behind"" is one of the most popular book series ever created, and for good reason.  From the very first chapter of the first volume, it took hold of me, and has not let go since.  I devoured the first three volumes in less than two weeks, and I'm very much looking forward to immersing myself in the rest of the story.  No doubt you've at least heard of the bestselling series about life during the end times of the world, and now, as is so often the trend, comes the movie.  After I read the first novel, I was very interested in seeing the film version, even though my gut told me it probably wouldn't be nearly as good.  I should've followed.  Don't get me wrong; it's not all bad.  The movie delivers a powerful message and makes a decent effort at summarizing the events in the book in an hour and a half.  But that's pretty much where the lauds end and the critic in me takes over.  It's great when you can enjoy the movie and follow the plot even if you haven't read the book.  It's not exactly a prerequisite to read ""Left Behind"" first, but it sure helps.  You'll understand the main message clearly enough, but to understand the action ""behind the scenes"", like the Antichrist's methods of rising to power, you have to know the supporting characters better than how they're portrayed in the film.  The special effects were average at best, and the action and intensity that makes the book series so compelling is all but missing here.  The acting itself was for the most part decent, but in some cases, I almost wanted to laugh out loud.  Kirk Cameron does turn in a good performance as Buck Williams, and Brad Johnson is a dead-on Ray Steele (if a teeny bit stiff).  All said, though, it seems that the main reason this movie was made was to get people to buy the book.  If the crew had had a bigger budget, and had made the film longer, I think it would have been a lot better.  The biggest shock for me, though, was that the authors of the book series appeared absolutely nowhere in the credits.  You'd think they'd have had at least a finger in production, which I think would've made a world of difference as well.  To put a period on this, if you're going to spend the money, it'd be much better spent on the first four books in the series.",979603200,10,2286,4.3364705882352945

While mid air, millions of people, all over the globe disappear, and no one knows what happened.  Except for Pastor Bruce Barnes of New Hope Church, who was left behind himself.

636516,1,6303382347,"When I heard of rumours of the Left Behind movie turning into a movie, I was exstatic. When I finally received the DVD as a Christmas present, I was filled with excitement. After watching the movie, I was floored with disappointment. Let me just name a FEW of the things wrong with this film:
a) It's only an hour and 20 minutes. The abridged version of the audio book is 3 hours, and the unabridged version is 10 hours! Basically, this movie is way too short!!! All types of shortcuts and deletions were taken from the book to compress this movie into a compact-sized version of the book. Important characters were removed, and even some characters from the 2nd book were introduced. Plot movement and, yes, characters that don't come around until more than half-way through the book took place in the opening 10 minutes in the movie, It was truly a huge disppointment to see all the best things from the book taken apart piece by piece and excluded from the film.
b) The special effects were so corny! I mean, the opening scene was absolutely brutal. I thought I was watching my old plastic G.I. Joe figurines coming to attack Isreal!
c) The acting was honestly, for the most part, terrible as well. I can never seem to tell the difference on Kirk Cameron face from when he's expressing humour and joy to when he's exressing sadness and grief! And did anyone else besides me notice that the dude who plays Ken Ritz is always smiling? Oh, and what about the guy who play Nicolae Carpathia? Obviously the guys who put this whole thing together forgot to tell him that in the book, Nicolae speaks PERFECT ENGLISH and doesn't have a Romanian accent!
d) The writing overall was lousy. You never had to worry about missing anything related to plot movement because whoever wrote this 'script' would have the characters explain it to the viewer anyway. 'Those planes are going down in flames and we haven't fired a single shot' - Chaim Rosenzweig. NO, REALLY?!
Basically I feel that this movie received way too much hype with all the 'high-profile actors' and 'amazing special effects' messages prior to it's release. Frankly, this is just another big let down from Cloud 10 Productions (don't even get me started on their previous releases - ie Tribulation, STARRING Gary Busey, and Howie Mandel!!! or Judgement, STARRING Corbin Bernsen and Mr. T!!!). Let's just hope this new film ""Waterproof"" (STARRING Burt Reynolds!!!) is for once a release that Christians can be proud of.
The only good that has come out of this movie is that SOMEHOW it managed to sell a ton of copies on the shelves which IS a good thing for the Christian film industry. But frankly, for Left Behind fans, the best we can hope to come out of this is a remake of the film 5-10 years down the road.

The acting, the special effects, the story, were all impressive.  I did not know what to expect from Kirk Cameron, whom I could only picture as young Mike Seaver.  While he does not portray Buck as the rough individual I had imagined, he does a fantastic job in his role.  The story flows effortlessly between a glimpse at what those who were ""left behind"" must endure in the immediate aftermath of millions of disappearances, to the rise of a new world leader.  I must also give much credit to Gordon Currie who plays the role of the rising leader, Nicolae Carpathia.  Gordon is masterful as Nicolae.  First appearing as a weak puppet, but then showing himself as the powerful, manipulating, and charismatic leader of the world he was destined to be.  All in all, it is a movie I recommend to everybody.  I also must say that, having seen it on video, it is definitely a theater movie.  So when it starts playing there on February 2, I will definitely be going.",979171200,8,1336,4.309236947791165

There is so much action going on that it is impossible to find a boring spot in the entire movie. You get swept along as people disappear and as those who are left behind struggle in the first hours of this horrific event. The direction was great and the actors played their parts so realistically that I was convinced during the movie that it was actually happening to them! While no one really knows what will really happen at this time in history, I felt that the movie portrayed well things that could happen, as did the authors of the books.

It is riddled with one-dimensional performances and cut-and-paste special effects. And what's with that sitcom has-been in the leading role?  The result might prompt Christians to cut ties with their faith out of sheer embarrassment. Worse, it's boring. Interestingly, when I first purchased the video, I found very few viewer reviews posted on this site. Most were poor. Now there are over 500 reviews and most of them are favorable. Then I remembered, ""Left Behind"" is scheduled to hit the big screens soon. In one of the oddest marketing ploys ever, the film was first released on video with filmmakers urging christian viewers to pack theaters to make it No. 1 at the box office. Something is afoot. I believe the good reviews posted here are fake an attempt to drive the market. But boy won't filmgoers be surprised when they actually pay to see this assinine garbage.

636879,4,6303382347,"Left Behind is one of those movies that you don't want to believe could be real, but have this strange feeling inside that it really could be!  The theme of the movie is something that has always attracted moviegoers' attention...the end of the world.  But one of the things that make this movie different is that it is based on events foretold in the only source that is universally recognized as THE authority on future events, the Bible!  That, combined with performances of some respected veteran actors (Kirk Cameron and Brad Johnson to name a few) keeps the audience riveted on the unfolding events and character development.  Some of that character development happens a bit slowly (i.e., Rayford Steele) but that only helps draw the viewer into the mind of Captain Steele as he wrestles with the meaning of the loss of his wife and son.  His own beliefs are changed as he sees the fulfillment of what his wife and other believers have warned him about, and that belief now begins to shape his actions and perspectives on the new world around him.
The book from which the movie is based takes even more time to develop the characters than the video, not only of Captain Steele but ""Buck"" Cameron Williams, flight-attendant Hattie Durham, and Pastor Bruce Barnes, but that is always the luxury of the printed page.  This movie has done a very good job of showing what could happen in the future if the events of Scripture were fulfilled literally, and in the mode of life in the 21st century.  Also, the lack of any high-tech, spectacular looking graphics draws viewers' attention to the characters themselves.  If the book sequels are also brought to the screen (or video) they should provide an even greater following by those curious about prophetic events of the future.",978912000,,1780,4.7752442996742674

636989,4,6303382347,"Or does it?  We'll find out when the film is released soon.  Hollywood is notorious for skirting the issue where reality is concerned (especially when the issue is based on Christian principles).  Accordingly, most Christ-related film projects (though many of them quite good)have been low budget.  Things may change;  if this film does as good in the box office as expected, Hollywood may have to start paying attention to the Christian film goer.  It's all about money, of course.  Anyway, Left Behind rocks!  The acing is top-notch: especially Kirk Cameron, Brad Armstrong, and the guy who plays the antichrist (the name elludes me at the moment, but he has the ability to kill in cold blood, yet still remain someone the viewer begrudgingly likes: charisma to spare).  Anyone who has delved into Revelation, the rapture, tribulation, etc., will find Left Behind has covered the bases; the authors and screenwriters did their jobs well.  I can almost guarantee that even the most devoted Biblical scholar will find something in the film that he or she did not think about before.  As for the non-Christian public, Left Behind leaves most other action/adventures in the dust.  Rent it AND THEN go see it.

637040,5,6303382347,"The history of Christian and faith-based motion picture releases has not always been noteworthy for high production quality or intriquing screen writing. While many pictures have been Biblically based on the truth of Scripture, far too many left us wanting in the excellence category.  However, director Vic Sarin's LEFT BEHIND is a marked departure from such mediocrity, giving us a film that is clearly the finest that Christian filmmakers have ever thrown upon the silver screen. Based on the first book in the New York Times #1 best-selling LEFT BEHIND series by Tim LaHaye and Jerry B. Jenkins, the film is set in mankind's last days just prior to the Rapture, the disappearance of true believers in Christ from around the globe. While the film necessarily makes some adjustments from the book (for example, Cameron ""Buck"" Williams is a star broadcast journalist, not a star magazine journalist), it still maintains the flavor and occasionally the intensity of the first book. Kirk Cameron, of television's Growing Pains fame, stars as the youthful but talented Buck Williams. Refreshingly, the actor does such a solid job on the screen (along with the bulk of the rest of the cast)that any recollections of past Christian films marked by poor acting quickly vaporize. Technically, from the cinematography to the use of digital effects to the sensitive and artistic use of lighting, LEFT BEHIND is without question the finest Christian motion picture ever made. Having a story framework the likes of LaHaye's and Jenkins' certainly doesn't hurt, and filmmaker Sarin's on screen direction is right on the money. The film is not heavy handed in the sense of dripping with ""hit-you-over-the-head"" evangelistic arm twisting. Rather, it portrays the Scriptural predictions of our perhaps immediate future, and the ramifications faced by  unbelievers who've suddenly and instantly found they've been left behind. In a world now void of real Christians, with the Antichrist preparing to ascend to power, those who knew the truth of Jesus Christ but never had a personal relationship with Him must now deal with unavoidable reality in a world literally going to hell. While LEFT BEHIND may not approach the special effects quality of INDEPENDENCE DAY or the sheer terror of certain scenes from TITANIC, it is nonetheless an excellent and compelling film, and has the advantage of being aided and abetted by prayer and by the truth of Holy Scripture. For Christians, for those fascinated by prophecy, and for anyone who wants to catch a possible glimpse of the future of the last days, LEFT BEHIND is a must-see.",978739200,10,2608,5.119718309859155

TO THE 99 PERCENT OF THE POPULATION THAT HAS NOT READ LEFT BEHIND,  This is a well told story of the end of times as well as visualy stunning.

637088,4,6303382347,"Left Behind: The Movie is a movie I believe every person needs to see. Even non-believers will enjoy it as an action film/drama. The producers deserve a pat on the back, and a hearty ""amen"" for their effort. All in all, they stayed true to the book. There were some differences of course, due to time constraints, but they did not take away from the story being told. The only thing that comes close to being classified as disappointing was due to the lower budget as compared to other movies of the day, ie. special effects, but again, this does not affect the story at all. Imagine what they would have been able to accomplish with a larger budget! The acting is very good, especially considering that not all the actors were Christians.
The story in a nutshell, tells us what may happen when Jesus Christ comes to rapture His people from the earth. We are shown a bit of the chaos that will ensue when drivers of automobiles simply disappear from behind the steering wheel. It shows the pain and fear of those whose loved ones are gone in an instant, with only their clothing and jewelry left in a small pile. Many exlanations are brought forth, from nuclear warheads to UFOs and space aliens, but a small group are led to the truth, by the raptured themselves. A husband remembers his wife telling him what will someday occur. A pastor leaves behind a video tape telling the same, only in more detail. No question is left by the end of the movie, when the most skeptical of all, a dyed in the wool logical thinking reporter, sees the truth & accepts it for himself. In this group, each person comes to know why he or she was left behind.
This movie brought tears to my eyes more than once. I could see myself at different points in my life in these people. I saw friends and family members in these characters. It should make one think long and hard about one's state of salvation, but also about how easy it is for Satan to deceive us. I believe that that it will make Christians, as well as non-believers, think about just where they stand. The scene with Pastor Bruce in the church comes to mind, with the question: Have I truly received Salvation, or am I simply going through the motions?
As I stated earlier, this movie should be seen by everyone. I believe it will touch them even if they aren't expecting it to.
There is no offensive language in this movie, no sex scenes, and what violence was necessary to the storyline is not vile and gory. There are adult themes, though, so I wouldn't recommend this for the smaller children of the family. If I were to use the current rating system, I'd put a PG rating only because of the adult themes.",978652800,11,2654,4.440573770491803
637089,4,6303382347,"Left Behind the Movie was impressive.  Even though the movie is only an hour and half, the movie is packed with action, right from the very start.  Planes overhead, explosions, good looking women-what more can you ask for in a movie!  This certainly is not one of the normal, boring, and usually horribly acted Christian movies that I have seen.  Kirk Cameron and Brad Johnson led this cast with superb performances as Buck Williams and Rayford Steele.  The two characters battle with the spirituality they know and come to find something bigger and better.  And yet they end up trapped in the middle of good and evil every time.  Perhaps one of the best casting moves this movie has made was that of Gordon Currie as Nicholae Carpathia.  Currie portrays the Anti-Christ character as he will be when he really comes-as a great, likable, and all around generous man.  One doesn't realize his true identity until the end of the film.
Amazingly enough, this movie is a great adaptation of the book, and follows very closely with what happened in it.  Had the viewer never read the book, however, the movie would have been just as good, if not better.  The characters are masterfully developed; bringing out who they truly are and watching them change as the movie progresses.  The plot twists, the hidden personalities of the characters, their conversions are all unforeseen when the movie begins.  Knowing nothing about the Biblical story or the Left Behind series would even further express the point that this movie is trying to get across.
The cinematography, directed by Peter and Paul Lalonde, rivals that of some Hollywood producers.  The use of different camera angles, colors, lighting, and overall direction is astounding, drawing the viewer into the film simply with how the film appears.  If you are thinking about seeing this movie a second time, please do.  After watching a second time, I realized that I liked the movie even more than the first.  To be honest, I wasn't too impressed the first time around, but maybe me expectations were too high.  I was able to catch many of the special production tricks that the Lalondes added to spice up this movie.

There was just something that didn't draw us into the characters the way the book did.

I say usually because Left Behind: The Movie is the exception to the rule. For a low-budget small studio production, Left Behind has the excitement and awe af any big budget thriller out there. The Lalonde brothers did an awsome job in casting and filming. The special effects are top notch.
Yes it was a direct to video movie. But that doesn't mean it was too horrible to go to the big screen. Cloud Ten Productions has an inspired idea to release the movie to video then create an excited climate to allow the film to be released in theaters.
This is just the first movie that is based on a series of books by Tim LeHey and Jerry Jenkins. I hope Hollywood can see that there is a audience for a christian themed movie. With prayer and support they will see that the No. 1 one direct to video movie can become the No. 1 movie in America.

Left Behind is, as you read above in other reviews, a story detailing the last days of this earth. It begins with the rapture of the church but its focus is on the non-believers left once the church ascends into heaven to be with Jesus.  It challenges audiences with the question-will you be ""Left Behind""? Although the film lacks the big-budget of most Hollywood films, there is no shortage of explosions, car crashes, and more!! But much more compelling than the special effects is the suspense that grips you! Because you aren't just watching another action movie-you are watching a preview of the future-these are the things to come! It is THRILLING in the extreme!!

Then, there are at least two sequels planned, the previews are on the video (with Mister T !!). But as funds are limited they can only make them if the theatre release is a success.
The thing that I found could be improved is the soundtrack. I guess they just couldn't afford a real orchestral movie score yet.
Another fact that I disliked: the bad guy seams to have a russian accent. That was definitely not a good idea. I think moviemakers should be more careful, especially if the movie has a message of this importance.
Other than that the movie is well done and includes some really god scenes. I was especially frightened by the way Nicolae Carpathia could deceive the surrounding people at the end of the movie. The makers did a great job showing the murders first from the inside of the room and then again but from the outside view of the security guards.

637397,2,6303382347,"I have read all of the books in the Left Behind series to date (latest being ""The Mark""). I can't say I had extremely high expectations for this movie. I usually never do on movies based on popular book series. Although I didn't expect the movie to adapt the book so terribly. The movie omitted a lot of details and focused the story on Kirk Cameron's character, Buck. Is this because he's a celebrity? Instead of starting out with Brad Johnson's character, Rayford, as it does in the actual novel. The scenes that were intense and dramatic in the book come off silly and unrehearsed in the movie.
I do realize though that it is difficult to bring a popular novel to the big screen without clashing with the reader's own thoughts. I just can't see any real consideration towards readers of the book. Nor can I see any supervision by the authors on this project even though they were supposed to have. The screenplay was very poorly developed and written.
The acting isn't the greatest but then again neither was the writing. In the book the characters aren't developed too deeply but the characters in the movie are horribly developed, more like not at all. The characters in the movie basically have mood and personality swings that are totally inexplicable. Kirk Cameron delivers a decent performance. As each of the actors have strong and weak points in their deliveries. The casting of the performers themselves seemed to disagree with the books description. The directing was all around weak as it could not fully capture the emotions. The special effects in the beginning seemed like they belonged in a video game.
The DVD features are decent as the ""behind-the-scenes"" and ""Left Behind project"" are interesting viewings. There isn't much after that. There are a couple music videos and some bios of the cast and crew. The DVD transfer is of below average quality. In a lot of scenes you can noticeably see the pixelation of the film. If you look closely you can see it throughout the entire movie.
I applaud the effort that was made to try to make this popular book series into a full fledged ""Hollywood"" movie. That is why I am criticizing it so hard. It lacks many qualities to do well in the ""Hollywood"" market. I do think a lot of it could have been saved with a better written script. If you do want to see this I suggest you either rent it or borrow a friend's copy. It isn't worth buying or seeing when it comes out in the theaters.

I thought it had very cheap production value, sort of like that of a made for TV movie on UPN. I found it overly preachy and pretentious, even condescending. I guess what I was looking for was some sort of truth, some sort of intelligent explanation that would give me a reason to believe. But, in the end, it came off like one of those religious tracts you find in bathrooms: over the top, irritating, and transparent. Nonetheless, I've borrowed the book and am attempting to read it. So far, I find the writing hollow and amateurish. I'm going to try the Christ Clone Trilogy. I've seen some really good reviews of it here. My aunt is a devout Christian and she loved this movie.

Then I found myself talking about the story to friends and family who also have read the book. When the video came out, I couldn't wait to get it. Not only did I enjoy it, but my 17 year old son did too. It is great. The story line is very intriguing and the acting is believable. What if? The authors of the Left Behind Series have applied teachings from the Bible to modern day life and politics and blended such a wonderful story... it is the next best thing to watching the Greatest Story Ever Told with Charleton Heston on Easter! I encourage you to see this movie - rent or buy it - buy the series of books and hope that the books in this series are turned into films... If you didn't understand all the Bible had to say and don't want to be preached too... then watch this. It will teach you without being preached to",978480000,,925,4.116022099447513

What was so striking about the movie?  I was startled by the reality.  The characters seem real, the story is more than plausible,and the importance of the message is felt immediately. Kirk Cameron's character is easy to identify with.  He, along with the other characters who were ""left behind"", all struggle to explain the happenings.
Most people have a faith or belief in God, but so many people don't go beyond this - they have little or no Bibical knowledge.  The movie made me want to read the Bible - to find out what the prophets have predicted  and to share this with others.

Granted, no movie is ever a straight takeoff of the book, but I think they could have made the movie a bit longer and stayed with the book a bit closer. For instance, Buck didn't get Hattie her job at the UN. In fact, Buck and Hattie didn't even know one another before the Rapture. Buck doesn't meet Rayford until much later. And Chloe's ""attachment"" to Buck just doesn't make sense with the information in the movie. In the book, their attraction is logical. I was just really disappointed. This could have been the first in a great series of movies to go along with the books, but I don't think I'd buy a second one if they made it (despite the fact that I finished the first eight installments of the book series in about five weeks).",978480000,,905,4.329411764705882

While the special effects in this movie are not quite up to a Star Wars calibre, the plot, dialogue, and thrill are all up to par with the Duel of the Fates.

It is an awesome action-packed movie on the first book in the series. While it has some differences, the message is the same. If one takes into account that the producer had over twelve hours of footage to squeeze into an hour and a half, then they did a great job. The only differences I see are that the characters meet up differently, but that isn't what makes the series and the message as popular as it is anyway. The important part of salvation is not introduced in such a way to swamp the viewer with scripture and extra drama. It is given in a comfortable way so that any nonChristian would not feel ""weird"" seeing it with Christians.  Overall, I give it an A+.

When I hear Brad Johnson was going to be in the film, I had some doubts. But he proved himself with Oscar-worthy acting. Great supporting cast, Hollywood-style directing, compelling songs (including the song BELIEVER by the Christian band Jake), a thoughtful score by James Covell, and Visual Effects that are amazing for a film that only cost $17.4 Million to make. But even with all this, the more important message still comes through, that God loves us so much, that he gave his only son Jesus to die for our sins. This is a film that everybody needs to see.

All you have to do is open the newspaper or turn on the news and you are bombarded with stories of death and despair, of tribulations and tragedy, of power and greed. Don't get me wrong, there are plenty of headlines that keep our minds at ease, like sports, fashion, food and stocks, but it still doesn't take away the overshadowing doom of a civilization in a downward spiral.  In spite of all the gloom there are some out there that still have hope, not hope in the American dream or world peace, because it is, if I may be blunt, impossible.  But this is a story of hope and of faith in a time when it will be all you will have left.  Left Behind is a ground breaking film, that was adapted from an earthshaking series of novels. What this movie will show is that in spite of the Hollywood hype and mainstream messages, here is a movie that is going against the flow and opening up the flood gates of a new generation of filmmakers and box-office victories.  2001 will be the year of New Beginnings in a dying age coming to it's end.

I feel that the movie was very well done and pointed.  Whether you're into Revelations or not, the points covered in this movie are real and will come to pass (maybe not exactly the way the movie portrays, but according to the general idea).

Kirk Cameron, of ""Growing Pains"" plays reporter Buck Williams who is aboard an aircraft piloted by actor Brad Johnson where people seemed to have vanished...at 37,000 ft above the earth!
The story unfolds with more intrigue, encapsulating the premise of the bible where those who are saved Christians will be taken up by Jesus to heaven while the rest of the world will spend 7 years in darkness because they refused to believe in Christ, they have been ""Left Behind!""

It's twisting plot held me the whole experience and being a Christian, I very much appreciated the religious references they planted so many times in the book. I am starting to read Tribulation Force, the next book in the series, and let me tell you it just gets better.
  I wish I could say the same for the movie. Let's start by going over the quality of the film. I guess you can rate this a ""B"" class movie, considering their low budget and phantom company name. But the special effects, if any, and the acting and plotline take care of themselves suprisingly enough to almost hold out against theatrical movies.
  As I said there weren't many chances to see some special effects, but the invasion scene in the beginning comes closest. It wasn't as chessy as it could have been, set aside the toy tanks rolling along, but it didn't show much signs of production weakness. Miracle maybe?
  Then the acting. Excellent. Most of the characters pulled it off nearly flawlessly. Rayford could've done the crying thing better. Buck Williams' acting was very professional, so when this movie hits theaters in Feb 1, I'm sure it'll boost his career.
  But as for the storyline, I think everyone who has read the book noticed that they've changed it around a lot and left things out. Leaving things out was what irked me the most. To someone who has not read the book, this will be very confusing. I'm hoping when they elease this theatrically, they'll add some parts from the book that are missing. Like the Eli and Moishe story.
  So all in all, I'm running out of space to write so I will sum it all up in one sentence. The production, acting, and music were great and will make this ""B"" movie able to stand up against ""A"" movies, but this movie is significantly short and leaves out a lot of important points in the story making new comers left behind in the plot.",978220800,,1969,4.4748603351955305

I always thought it would make a tremendous tv series though. I didn't think that the Movie would have the same ""Punch"" the books did. Especially since it didn't have the big studio money behind it.
Man, was I wrong.  I should have had more ""Faith"".  Forgive me.  The Video was exceptional.  I watched it with a friend and the only question he had was ""what happened to the disk Dirk had in his hand"".  I told him it disappeared.
I bought this video for myself when it first came out. I liked it so much I then bought it as Christmas gifts.  This video is for ALL Christians.
Don't be afraid of the Independant Film label.  The film quality and acting are right up there with the big labels. And with some of the duds the big labels have produced lately, it's time to spend our money on more indie films.

The story follows the Left Behind book series written by Tim LaHaye and Jerry B. Jenkins.  It's the story of Revelations as it will actually happen.
To those who have read the book series, you'll be pleasantly surprised to find that this film stays true to the both the Word of the Bible and to the words written by the authors.
For anyone looking for the secret of the Universe and beyond, you'll find it in Left Behind, The Movie.  For those of you who believe any kind of ""religious"" media is hokey or too fantastic, this film will change those views.
As for the technical aspects, the special effects, art direction, and the location shots are spectacular.  In fact, as a retired video producer, I believe this film incorporates the highest production values.
The story and characters, particularly Kurt Cameron as ""Buck Williams"" are compelling and relative. The Story is fast-moving and full of intrigue, as the characters try to deal with the day following The Rapture and subsequent ascention of the antichrist.
In the story, a pastor finds out that ""there is a difference between knowing and believing,"" in other words, some people just don't ""get it.""
I'm not sure Hollywood ""gets it"" either. The kind of revenue this type of film can produce will be monumental.  It's probably the ""step next"" for industry producers and writers to consider, because lets' face it, most of us are pretty tired of  the same old junk coming out of the film industry.

At first I wondered about Kirk Cameron playing the roll of Buck, mainly because of all the years on Growing Pains, but he was awesome!  I think all the cast members did a great job. I don't have anything negative to say about this movie.  If there was ever a movie or series of books to get people to Christianity, this is the one.

Such as, ""Buck Williams"" (played by Kirk Cameron) depics a realistic hero, contrary to the ""catching-bullets-in-their-teeth"" or superman characters. The attention to details is extrodanary.

638083,5,6303382347,"The soundtrack for the movie is excellent. The music is strategically placed at great points. The music helps set the mood.
The movie Left Behind does assume that the audience has some knowledge of biblical prophecies of the end times. However, this is in the beginning and does not take away from the movie. The different events--the rapture, building of the temple, etc.--are explained and the biblical prophecies referring to it are pointed out. The confusion of those who are left behind from the rapture is shown in the movie.
The movie does an excellent job showing how the technology we have now and events taking place make the biblical prophecies more of a reality of our time than in previous generations.
This sparks interest in those unfamilar with the prophecies who want to know more. There are many sources of information about the tribulation due to the demand and curiosity of readers of the left behind series. The movie, more available to general audiences, will spark interest in a lot of people.
This movie will open doors for many to what the Bible has to say about the end times.",978134400,,1102,4.774869109947644

While the books are a masterpiece of storytelling skills, the movie will hopefully inspire those who have not read the books to do so.  The movie is based on the first of the Left Behind books of the same title.  It focuses on the initial events after the Rapture of the Church.  The main characters are caught in a chaotic event that effects all of mankind.  As Rayford Steele an airline pilot and his daughter Chloe unravel the mystery of the disappearances of millions of people around the globe, a bigger story is unfurling in the U.N..  Nicolae Carpathia has risen to power and is now the leader of the United Nations.  But his quick uprising is not just due to political savvy, it is prophecy come to life!

Many authors both biblical and non biblical call this series the most accurate interpretation of Revelation yet.  It may be a fiction series, but I have cryed through all of the books and can not wait for the next book to come out.
The movie truly hits home.  The church I attend in Dalton Georgia is called Dug Gap Baptist Chruch.  My Sunday School class sponsored a showing of the movie and over 50 adults and children attended.  There were 2 decisions made for Christ that very night.  The movie takes into account real people working day to day.  Some peoples jobs take priority in their lives where as others it may be family or money.  But what happens when you wake up in the middle of an airplane flight only to find your children gone and you have been Left Behind.  I do not know about you, but that would get my attention!  To realize that after all is said and done your children have gone to heaven and you left behind would break anyones heart.
Whether you are a christian or not, everyone should see this action packed thriller.  And please read the books as well!  Once you pick them up, you won't be able to put them down.

638156,4,6303382347,"I know it sounds a bit cliche but it's true, the truth can truly set you free.  I saw the best movie one night at a friend's get together.  It was about the tribulation, the rapture and the Bible.  At first I thought, oh great someone else is going to tell me that I needed the Lord to be whole.  That's how I felt before the movie started.  How I felt after the movie ended, that's a different story.  The movie I saw that night changed my life, it was called, ""Left Behind the movie.""  The movie starts out in a battle scene type setting.  From the moment the movie starts, one, has to pay very close attention to get all that's going on.  From the beginning, ""Left Behind"", makes you think.  All of which is depicted could easily be found in today's world.  This includes the movie and the Bible.  It's kinda scary (at the time) to think the rapture is so close.  No one really knows how long there is till the believers are taken.  ""Left Behind"", depicts the rapture in such a way that you can't help but be in awe of the film.  I have never wanted to own a religious video, before I saw, ""Left Behind.""  Heck, I didn't want anything to do with God before the movie.  The characters are so real and I could relate to Kirk Cameron's character the most.  He had to have proof of God's love and power.  I guess I needed the same proof.  It didn't take much coaxing..God had always tugged on my heart.  The movie is great and anyone who sees it will agree.  After the movie ended, I had lots of questions.  I joined a church shortly therafter, and have never loved life more.  I have a great outlook on life now, that was absent before the Lord.  This movie, I know, will change people, for the better.  It will make you cry and feel things somewhat bengin to you.  In the long run, it'll change you.  Maybe not into a complete believer but it sure will put the spark in your heart and questions in your head.  Someone once asked me, if the rapture came today, was I positive I would be taken.  In my heart I knew the answer was no.  After I saw the movie and the events that came after, the same question was asked.  I then could say with faith and love, yes, I would be taken to live with thy Father in Heaven.  It was not until I saw, ""Left Behind the movie"", that I was saved andI knew God truly was real.  I recommend everyone see this movie.  It's something to grab onto and pray that others are made like it.  That way the message can get out that the Lord is real and that he loves everyone one of us.  This movie can also let people know that he may be coming for us very soon.  I know that there are many people who truly do not wanna be, left behind.",978134400,,2661,4.115009746588694

My only DISSAPOINTMENT is that for some reason Hollywood still does not 'get it'. They could make movies like this and appeal to millions around the globe, they choose not.

638217,1,6303382347,"This may be one of the great boners of all time when it comes to so-called ""Christian"" film making.  The movie plays into the siege mentality of easily-led fundamentalists who have bought the books en masse.  At times, it almost seems to imply that true Christians will, at the very least, distrust -- if not oppose outright -- peacemaking, feeding programs and international dialogue.  The UN is the boogeyman (shades of Tim McVeigh?) and, of course, the Anti-Christ (with the help of Jews and brown-skinned peoples of the world) assumes power at the UN. The acting is abysmal.  The players either lack conviction (as if they were sniggering at the sloppily constructed script when the cameras were off) or they lack ability  (witness, Kirk Cameron -- he stunk on TV so why should we expect different here?)  People were miscast - the AntiChrist looks more like a boyscout in a school play.  The ""repentant"" unbelievers who come to faith after the ""rapture"" are unbelieveable.  They get over their grief at mysteriously losing their loved ones in a heartbeat!  And the theology?  Well, let me refer you end-times enthusiasts to Richard Kyle's book ""THE LAST DAYS ARE HERE AGAIN"" or Paul Boyer's monumental work, ""WHEN TIME SHALL BE NO MORE"".  In the meantime, don't waste a cent on this video!  (Oh, and the special message from Kirk Cameron after the movie?  Yeah - it's not a Gospel invitation or even an inside look at the making of the film.  And what do THEY want?  Go to the website and see.  The movie is SO poor, they are trying to convince people to donate at least a hundred dollars to bring it to local theaters around the country.  So it's not just a bad piece of filmmaking...it's also a fundraising scam!  (Your donation's not refundable if the theaters don't agree, by the way.)  Left Behind -- the books and the movie -- are classic examples of how Evangelical Christians continue to sing the same tune.

And that's where the problem lies.  If I was a not a Christian and saw this movie, I would be curious but that's about all.  'The Omega Code' was better.  I think that a TV series on PAX would be more effective--cover all of the books released to-date and stay close to the story line!  Read the books--much better.",978048000,,489,4.426966292134831

Rarely do I find a form of mass media that causes me to evaluate my actions and their reprecussions to the degree that this movie did.  Though the books, which were filled with scripturally grounded truths, insued extreme conviction, the movie captured the same elements without the actual process of reading having to be done.  My roommate, who has yet to read the books, was able to follow the story and catch the intended message just as easily as I was.  The spontaneously occurring incidents kept the attention of the watchers without overwhelming them into confusion.  I walked away with just a glimpse of what one would feel like having walked through the rapture.  I especially admired the way that the director captured the change that occurs in people's personalities when shaken to such an extent.  Buck, although following his investigator instints, is clouded with a sense of confusion.  Rayford sees for the first time the pieces of what his wife was saying fall into place.  I would highly recommend this movie to anyone willing to face the true of what lies ahead for us as humans.  For those who don't want to invest in buying the movie, or for those who want to support the makers of this film, or for those willing to give it a chance on the big screen, LEFT BEHIND will be released on February 2 in theatres.

Bravo to Kirk Cameron for shedding all the pre-conceived notions I had of him (Mike Seaver, Growing Pains) and playing a character so far from what the nation has seen of him before.  Also watch for Janaya Stephens, as Chloe Steel, she is definately going to be on the ""up-and-coming"" list.  She is a very talented actress (and cute too).

This movie is non-stop action.  It leaves you on the edge of your seat.  You become a part of each character as you see them frantically search for missing loved ones in a time that they find no answers.  Then, you see them turn toward God and seek the answers they so desperately crave.

While the movie does not follow completely along with the book, it hits each of the important parts and shows them with great detail.  I highly recommend this movie!

Some of the technology may be a little ""out there"" so to speak, but so is any science fiction.  I enjoyed the video, I believe it a little mild, comparatively for what may actually happen.

638331,5,6303382347,"Have read all the books in the Left Behind Series but was a bit hesitant to try the movie, as most other ""christian"" movies I've seen were just not the quality of acting and production that makes for a really good movie. Not so here! The casting, acting talent, production, sets, effects etc. were as slick and professional as any Hollywood movie I've seen---even BETTER than many!
As an avid reader, I've rarely been able to say any movie was better than the book, but can here. The first book in the series moved a little slow for my taste as it laid a foundation and background for the series. Had even decided not to continue the series at one point---until the shocking end, which was quite a cliffhanger! The movie on the other hand was much faster paced and action oriented.
Regardless of however one's personal beliefs or interpretations of Bible end-time predictions differ with those of the movie plot, it makes for a great mystery/adventure for any ""believer"", ""unbeliever"" or anything in between! I've always believed the book of Revelation in the christian New Testament would make a spectacular movie subject if produced with top-notch special effects and acting. I think the talent behind this movie is on the right track and could pull it off if they can keep up the momentum and get the necessary backing to fund it!
Let's be realistic, all beginnings have an end---that must surely include the history of mankind as we know it, as well. Hollywood film archives are full of thrilling science fiction tales of ""the end"", from Road Warrior to The Body Snatchers and Terminator---many based on very plausible possibilities.

Problems?  Kirk Cameron looks a little young for his role.  This film is the first of a series and that's obvious from the conclusion.  There were a couple of points where pacing might have been a bit better.  (I was going to say that the UN's explanation for the disappearances is preposterous, but having read some of the stuff the UN promulgates, I don't know that I'd say that's unrealistic).

638333,4,6303382347,"""Left Behind-The Movie"" is an extraordinary piece of film work. Starring Kirk Cameron as Buck Williams, ""Left Behind"" tells the story of the final days before the rapture. As people all over the world disappear, a wordlwide disaster is declared. Buck discovers the truth about Nicolae Carpathia, who is coming to power in a time of crisis, and hooks up with 3 other believers, and together the form the Tribulation Force, who must stop the rise of the AnitChrist.  This movie is amazing. It is not preachy at all, which can be a huge fault in many Christian movies, and tells the story just as a regular action movie would. There are surprises and twists, and the story behind it is great. Kirk Cameron does a wonderful job playing the zealous reporter, and has a great supporting cast working with him. While the ending does leave you hanging, it is only based on the first book in the ""Left Behind"" series, and there are 7 more to follow. All in all, this is a great movie, which is not getting the recognition it deserves. Hopefully when it is released in theatres on February 2, 2001, people will finally open their eyes to the wonder that is this movie.",977961600,,1158,4.5673076923076925
638334,5,6303382347,"Left Behind is an exciting production worthy of an Academy Award for the script, music, best actor, Kirk Cameron and best supporting actor, Brad Johnson.
The script stays true to the book, an apocolyptic thriller based upon biblical prophecy. Although the circumstances and characters in the film are fictional, the basis of the film is truth through God's word in the Holy Scriptures.
The music moves with the action, and provides catchy, upbeat rythum.
Kirk Cameron shines as the star actor, Buck Williams, an anchor for a worldwide news station.  His acting is true to character.
Brad Johnson's performance as Rayford Steele is compelling because he is so believeable...as a non-believer in God and repelled by his wife's convictions. He grows with the character and gives a truly award worthy performance.",977961600,,809,5.175572519083969

My dad has never read any of the books and he really loved it.  It provides suspense, tears, and humor.  The cast is a terrific ensemble of people and it is a well made movie.  It was not a cheap B movie that has no point.  The movie's ending also leaves open to a sequel.",977961600,,421,3.8372093023255816
638377,4,6303382347,"For those who have read the books, this film will seem too short and you will know the scenes that are missing.  If you haven't read the books, you will not know that anything else belongs in the movie.  It is sometimes slower-paced that you might want, but overall it grabs your attention and keeps it throughout the film.  The special effects are not as dramatic as other high-budget films, i.e. James Bond, etc., but they are to be computer-enhanced before the film is released to the theaters on February 2nd, 2001.  Not everyone identifies the ""bad guy"" quickly, but that just adds to the film's suspense.  I enjoyed the movie a great deal and expect to watch it again in the theaters.  I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes thought-provoking drama; you wouldn't want to be left behind.",977961600,,802,4.652482269503546
638378,5,6303382347,"Years ago when the Left Behind plot-line was first conceived by Dr. LaHaye, there was no way he could have predicted the impact this solid story would have not only on Christians, but also on those lost in the world today.  For quite some time I had anticipated this movie, and thus had many pre-conceptions of how it should be completed.  When I received it, it was different than I expected, but definitely in a good way!  While there were changes made to the plot of the Left Behind novel, these changes really help the flow of the plot and trim away un-needed details that somewhat made the novel move slowly.  This movie not only has action and riveting suspense, but the acting is the best element.  In previous Christian works, the acting has been the most criticized element, but in Left Behind, each character is believable and will capture the hearts of moviegoers everywhere!  In particular, Gordon Currie takes the character of Nicolae Carpathia and twists it into a ""trust-worthy"" character that takes the audience by surprise.  Clarence Gilyard who portrays the lost minister Bruce Barnes, pulls on the emotional strings of the audience in a way that causes one to realize the truth of the message.  Coming from a past of TV fame, Kirk Cameron does a remarkable job of stepping into the skin of Cameron ""Buck"" Williams, as do Brad Johnson and Janaya Stephens who portray Rayford and Chloe Steele, respectively.  Last but definitely not the least, Chelsea Noble IS Hattie Durham in looks, personality, and every other way.  She is exactly what I imagined Hattie as.  The cast is remarakable even despite the lack of ""blockbuster"" stars.  One piece of constructive criticism I have is on the length of the movie.  I wish it was longer and included more character development, but on the 1 1/2 hours that it runs, it does a very well job of quickly introducing the characters without slowing the action down.  Even with a modest budget, this movie does the job of conveying the horror and terror that will follow the rapture, but does not overlook the feelings of those who will be Left Behind.  It is believable, realistic, and has the ability to change Christian film-making like Star Wars changed the secular world!",977961600,7,2229,4.783289817232376
638379,5,6303382347,"I think that the left behind movie was wonderful, because it had much suspense and followed the book pretty close.

638380,4,6303382347,"This is an excellent movie! I have read all of the currently 8 books available in the series and the movie was very close to the book with some minor variations to assist with overall time compression. Mr. LaHaye and Mr. Jenkins have such wonderful expository styles that every scene and moment could not possibly fit in only 2 hours. You will begin to find a deeper and clearer understanding of the Book of Revelations without the ""Pushiness"" of Hellfire and Brimstone. Make no mistake, the foundation of the prophesies of this movie are in place and this piece could be considered ""Factual Fiction"". Can't wait for the next movie?

My husband bought this movie for me for Christmas knowing how much I am enjoying the books, he had not read any of the books.  We set down together on Christmas Day to watch it and to say the least my husband's interest in the book series is piqued.  He started reading the first book immediately.  Even if die hard fans of these books are somewhat disappointed with this movie I say so what!  If it gets 25% new readers interested then it has done a great job!!

While most action, comedy, and romance movies are now manufactured via cookie-cutter fashion, it is refreshing to see a new and original style.

It also calls you to wonder if you'll be like Pastor Bruce, and only think you believe.  If after this movie you do not question what will happen to you when the Rapture occurs, and it will, then you need to read the series of books that go along with the movie, and be sure to pick up the other Best Seller - The Bible.

With this bieng said I'm happy to say that the movie did not dissapoint. The directors and actors were able to capture the emotion and drama that an only come from such a devastating yet glorious event in the course of human existance. The story line was true to the novel and the selection of characters was excellent. Many of the actors were almost exact to the way I'd imagined them from Jenkins and Lalonde's descriptions. Mannerisms, attitude, and journey' to Christ were true to form. I can say without a doubt that if you enjoyed the novels as much as I did, then you will enjoy the film just as much.

My husband gave it to me for Christmas and some friends came over and we hurried to watch what we felt would be a tremendous movie.  I think that this will be good for people to go and see on February 2, that have never read the series.  Hopefully it will stir them up and they will want to read the whole series.  As usual I must say that the book was much better.  I often feel that way about movies that are previously written in novel form.  But the point of the movie is to help those that do not read the books to understand what all of the rest of us are so excited about.  I have gotten so many people to read these books, yes they are written simply,(as another reviewer wrote)  but, that is so EVERYONE will get the message.  The movie is the same, there are parts that were cut out and some added, but it is very viewable and an excellent movie for those who have questions about what Left Behind is all about.  I encourage anyone to go and see the movie when it is released. Whether you feel production is good or not writing is excellent and The actors chosen are also a good fit.

Watching this film was like reliving the experience of old friends.  It was interesting to me, knowing how future events were going to affect these characters, watching them introduced on film for the first time.  From the sight of planes exploding midair over Israel, to Buck's first prayer before the meeting with Nicolae, I found the movie to be both touching and thought-provoking.

It shows that they will need to make a decision based on the information and circumstances in front of them.

I really wasn't sure how a movie would work with the book's plot.  Both my husband and I were pretty impressed!
However, I must warn any person who has not read the books that this movie will probably be more of a mystery than anything - plot twists aren't explained for lengthy periods of time and the many of the characters' emotional states are extremely simplified.

The trailers from the other films of Cloud Ten really frightened me. Was this to be a film suitable for a religous school retreat or a serious attempt to make a major motion picture.
The answer: Neither.  The film was well done and well acted, however it is suitable for network TV, rather than theatrical release (It's a TV movie).
I've listened to all the books through Audible's service and frankly found the Movie more plausible than the first book. The explanation of Nicolae's rising to ultimate power makes more sense, in relation to the US. The explanation of disappearances provided by Nicolae is reasonable, as well. Belive me, these are two points necessary for suspension of belief.
The Christian music seemed a little heavy at times, but overall I enjoyed the movie. My wife, who had no exposure to the books, also enjoyed the movie.",977788800,,981,4.730994152046784

I have read every last book twice with the exception of the Mark, which I only read once. The movie stays pretty accurately with the Left Behind book....although they did take some artistic license which actually hurt the Movie.
You do have to keep in mind that this movie is low-budget, so some of the blatant miss-castings are going to have to be excused. Cameron was good as Buck, but he looked like a kid. Rayford looked very young as well. Nicolae had the accent but did not have the imposing stature that the book describes. Chaim was excellent casting in my opinion.
I feel that the casting of Bruce Barnes was horrible! First off, he was too young and that alter scene was unconvincing not to mention blasphemous. The crisis Bruce had would be gut wrenching and upsetting....fear and emotional collapse, not anger. That scene had no feeling, at all.
Flaws asside, this movie stayed very true to the spirit of the book and was very enjoyable. The scene with Buck and Nicolae at the U.N. really was powerful and believable. You actually could feel his dilemna and his decision to believe. I feel that although flawed, this movie was very good considering it being low budget.

We get so hung up on our intellectual high-horse that we fail to distinguish between the two very different mediums of literature and film.  If so-called Christians who love to find flaw with anything and everything (like the Pharisees and Saducees of Jesus'time) would let a little love in their hearts, there would be no bickering about whether the film is like the book or not, etc. I became a Christian thanks to the ministry of Hal Lindsey back in the early '70's, and I am here to say that this movie can be used as a great witness tool.

I have read the first 4 books in the Left Behind series and frankly, I know what makes a good book-adapted movie because I have seen so many bad ones.  So far, my favorite book has been ""Left Behind"" and I was extremely excited when I heard that it was being made into a movie.  Overall, the movie is not bad, but it is really not that good either. The Bruce Barnes character seemed contrived and underdeveloped. Further, when he cries to God in the chruch I was totally unmoved because it seeemed so...phony. The realization that he had not been a true Christian in the book was thoughful, profound and soul searching. The realzation in the movie was at best an "" Oh, crap, I guess I was wrong..HMM Ok,well NOW I will be a real Christian this time. No really, I will, I mean it..."".  It really lacked any serious contemplation and sincerity. I am sorry to say this, but simply, it was just really bad acting.  Infact, all of the characters fall short of REALLY expressing their transformation from non- Christianity to accepting Christ in their lives.  Overall,there was much less character developement than there should have been. The book made you feel like a part of the character's lives and if you are a Christian, it made you connect with them and test your own faith--which is good. All very moving stuff.  The movie made me question nothing except why they made this movie.  I am trying not to be too harsh because it was not all bad, and I realize that movie adaptations from books are not usually as in depth, as the books themselves, but the movies should at least try and capture the ESSENCE of the book.

The CGI effects at the beginning, looking as though they were rendered on a 386 Packard Bell, seemed to be the beginning of more fun than even Casper Van Dien (the DeNiro of his generation) and evil rabbi Michael Ironside could provide.  Much to my surprise, despite performances ranging from OK to pretty weak to laughable, the movie actually is good for more than just some unintentional laughs.  It's not The Deer Hunter, but it's a huge step up from The Omega Code.  If Christian film continues to evolve at it's current pace, we may have some genuinely good Christian films out there sooner than I certainly would have ever thought.  As for the quality of the presentation on disc, the transfer is surprisingly pretty solid, with occasional artifacting, and the audio is definitely serviceable (though only Pro Logic).

Now that this is off my chest let's talk about this film. Most movies put out by Christians are tacky and cheesy (i.e., Judas Project, Thief In The Night series, Appocalypse). This movie however has strong performances and a decent script. Kirk Cameron is a lot better than I had expected as Buck. The suspense is there and I think they did a good job of setting up the storyline. I had not read the series prior to the movie and I thought it was very easy to follow. Viewing the film actually inspired me to read all the other Left Behind series books. Though they have their faults, I do believe that future films would be great!

Many discredit this movie for its flat acting, ""cheap"" special effects, and dilution of the message conveyed in the novels. I disagree with all these points. The acting, though not memorable, was adequately convincing. (And yes, I include Kirk Cameron in that statement.) The effects were quite good, especially considering the humble budget available for this movie. And the message was loud and clear, well-conveyed but not obviously overstated.
It's the plot that bothers me. This movie was not an adaptation, it was a near-total re-write! I lost count of the number of scenes which made me realize, ""Wait, THAT didn't happen!"" At first, I thought I just had a bad memory, but then the mangled plot lines grew in number and diversion from the novel. I understand the need to slim down the plot to fit the movie (which was only 90 minutes, another disconcerting point). But EVERYTHING changed, to the point where the movie tells a completely different story from the novel. Only the characters, and the occurance of the Rapture, remained the same.
I won't describe the differences, so as not to spoil this movie for future viewers. But I will suggest that you give up on the movie, and invest in the novels instead.",976665600,,1332,4.872246696035242

Jesus's name was never mentioned in the whole movie. The movie never explained what one should do to ensure that they're not ""left behind"".

I found most of the major characters to be convincing and the story to be captivating. Gordon Currie's portrayal of the sinister Carpathia was especially good. In the climactic scene near the end of the movie he reminded somewhat of Ralph Fiennes portraying Amon Goeth in ""Schindler's List"".

I thought it was lacking in dialog in that they used alot of Christian cliche's such as when the girl tells ""Buck"", ""you can feel Him tugging on your heart..."", that is so overused and plain it's almost a turn-off and puts you in mind of a made for tv movie (surprised they didn't say ""Smile, God loves you"" somewhere in there).

Left Behind is the story about mankind's last days on Earth and what causes it's destruction.  Delicately touching upon biblical verses of Earth's final days, Left Behind takes us through a journey of those left behind after many people have disappeared under mysterious circumstances.  Amoung the cast is Kirk Cameron who plays Buck Williams, a journalist witnessing first hand these odd days and doubting with everyone else that they are happening.
While Left Behind certainly contains Christian and bibilical views, it is also certainly not attempting to convert non-Christians with it's material.  It's a movie with a well writen story, and not intended for only Christian audiences, but for all.
The movie isn't perfect, nothing is.  But with a story so interesting and that could possibly happen, Left Behind has all it needs in it's story and suberb acting by it's stars.  Don't be put off by its above average special effects that you see near the beginning of the film, for they more than aducately do the job.  Like I said, it isn't about special effects, it's about story.
I strongly encourage everyone to purchase this movie, watch it and then spread the word.  The success of this film relys upon the word of mouth generated by those who see the film on video before it's release to theaters in February 2001.

638684,3,6303382347,"With the coming of the Millennium, and the Mideast situation again in the headlines, groups of Christian filmmakers have determined that the time is right to reinterpret the Biblical prophetical books (Daniel, Ezekiel, and Revelations, primarily) and the stories of the Antichrist and the Rapture. The first of the current 'End of the World' films was 'The Omega Code', featuring Caspar Van Dien as a reporter involved with a charismatic leader (Michael York), who was actually the Antichrist; in 'Left Behind', the reporter is Kirk Cameron, with the leader portrayed by Gordon Currie. Both films feature 'mainstream' casts, better-than-average production values (although the FX are bargain basement, at times), and a moral that says that although even worse times are coming, God will prevail (as opposed to Hollywood's earlier Antichrist films, 'The Omen', and 'Rosemary's Baby', for example) that put Satan on top, at films' end.
Where 'Left Behind' and 'The Omega Code' differ is the interpretation of when the Rapture, the Biblical-predicted ascension to Heaven of the faithful, will occur. 'The Omega Code' implies that the Antichrist will already be in place, and world events already twisting to his purpose, when the devout will disappear. 'Left Behind' follows the majority Christian opinion, that the devout will leave before the seven-year Tribulation (rule of the Antichrist) begins. In following this interpretation, the Rapture serves as a Stephen King-like opening to 'Left Behind', and provides a 'hook' that the rest of the film plays off of.
One of the things that struck me as interesting about 'Left Behind' was that, as children, our church hammered into us, again and again, to accept Christ and AVOID missing the Rapture, and being left behind, at all costs! 'Left Behind' on the other hand, says, in effect, 'Hey, most of us will miss the boat, so let's face the worst of times with faith'. This may be a more honest way of seeing things, but it still feels uncomfortable!
The story focuses on Brad Johnson, a career-motivated married pilot with a girlfriend on the side, who has no time to listen to his wife's Christian message (guess which one goes to Heaven in the Rapture?), and Kirk Cameron (looking VERY young!), an international reporter who witnesses first-hand the Biblical prophecies being fulfilled, yet searches for human explanations for events. Both men must reexamine their lives, and discover for themselves God's purpose.
Don't expect a neat and tidy resolution to 'Left Behind'! The first of a four-film saga of the Tribulation, the story serves primarily to introduce characters, place the Antichrist as the Ruler of the Earth, and show that no human can stop or even slow down his ascent. Only faith and the love of God will help those 'left behind' to survive, elements that they lacked prior to the Rapture, but that they must embrace despite the price in suffering they will have to pay, if they want any chance of salvation!
For non-Christians, this message may seem fanciful, and the story second-rate Ludlum; for those who do follow Christ, 'Left Behind' is intended as a 'Wake-Up Call', not as well-done as it might have been, but powerful, nonetheless! Is it great cinema? Not really, but it is better than the standard 'religious' film, and deserves respect for attempting to buck the 'typical' Hollywood product, with a message which may be quite timely!",976147200,9,3411,5.0928571428571425

The story of the rapture was not spelled out clearly, however, this movie gives non-believers just enough information, I think, to peak their curiosity and start to ask questions. It is up to us Christians to get this message out and fill in the blanks. I think it is an awesome witnessing tool and should be a part of every believer's library.

638686,5,6303382347,"Considering that Big Budget studios just aren't interested in Christian story lines, this DVD is a great example of working with what you have. There are a few flaws of course, aside from the fact that yes, it does appear more as a TV movie. I haven't read the books, so I can't compare them to the movie, but being a movie buff, I thought it was great! The acting was mostly pretty bad, like in the Omega Code, but also like in the Omega Code it was thankfully ballanced with some good acting from Kirk Cameron, the antichrist character Nicolae and the Captain's (very cute) teen daughter Chloe. I must say again the antichrist character was excellent! He's going to get creepier and creepier in the sequels, and I can't wait till they get into the Mark! Looking forward to the sequels to the Omega Code too! Anyway, as for other flaws, well, it gets a bit preachy at times, which really needs to be softened up in order to reach non Christians with the message of the film. You can't be too, too obvious, though I know it's difficult in this sort of movie. The Captain's transformation into a Christian was so sudden and strong. It might have been more believable from the Preacher or someone else. The biggest flaw to my mind was the music, it just didn't seem to fit the scenes at times. I'm speaking mostly about the Ballads, not the score. There were scenes with Christian rock thrown in where it didn't seem to fit. Other than that though, it's an excellent movie. Seeing the clothes lying there after the people disappeared seemed a bit of a corny touch at first, but I suppose it does make sense. Maybe they could have been smoking or something. Give them some radiation burn like the shroud of turin. Anyway, it was a great movie, probably better than Omega Code, though that one was good too. I'm looking forward to the sequels a lot now that the groundwork is set. It was really getting interesting toward the end and left you wanting more of Carpathia!

If I had not read the book I would have been totally lost.(I've read all eight books) Pray for a re-make of this exciting series, that could truly be a blessing to the unsaved. But when this comes out on the big screen it will flop and I feel will hurt the book series and the message. I fail to see why a first class production could not have been done.

I must say this, this is a heck of a lot better than The Omega Code(though my review on Omega Code highly favored it at the time).Why, it's less hype,minimal Hollywood special F/X and no melo-dramatics by the actors. It's in the subtlety of the f/x department for Left Behind that lets the acting and story take over this time in a film dealing with the apocalypse ! And, yes, Kirk Cameron has come quite a ways from his earlier teen acting days with ABC's Growing Pains family sit-com. While he may not be on the same acting status as Michael J.Fox in Hollywood terms, he's still commendable for his performance as a top Journalist named Buck Williams. I cannot picture Fox playing the same role with a straight face...
Again, the strength in this film is it's subtlety with regards to effects. Maybe there is another spiritual message there also;Everyone expects the second coming of the Lord to be a huge spectacular laser show when,who knows, it may be a very humbling experience !
Left Behind may not be overwhelmed with a roster of top Hollywood names. Yet, Kirk Cameron and Brad Johnson are ideal for the roles !",975974400,5,1270,4.478448275862069

As a consumer and a person educated in the subject being presented in this movie, I was disappointed.  The film length, loyalty to the original theme and specific actor portrayals of characters and the character conversions was lacking substance. I was pleased with Kirk Cameron's performance as 'Buck', but specifically, [and I am a Brad Johnson fan] Brad Johnson lacked credibility as Rayford Steele. He's good as the pilot, but not as the new christian. He seems to betray the character's true conversion. And it is short on time. Less than 90 minutes is not enough time to explain this historically significant period all these folks are going through. But I leave it to God to bless. I hope it is remade at a later date.

For a book at the top of the best seller lists, I'm surprised that there weren't any big investors in the movie.  However, when it is released in theatres in February 2001, hopefully it will be a big enough box office draw that the future movies will have some real money backing it.  Cloud Ten did a great job delivering the message and creating a movie that satisfies and yet still leaves you wanting more.  If everyone who enjoyed the book (putting it on the bestseller lists) goes to the movie, the movie studio might just be able to produce Tribulation Force and the following books.
And for those of you who think this is fiction .... buy the Left Behind series and read it side by side with the book of Revelation in the Bible.  The characters in Left Behind may be fiction, but the events are prophetic.  With everyone reading the books and seeing the movie, no one should be Left Behind!",975628800,9,1164,4.41588785046729

Compared to other low budget films that get produced every year, this is definitely one of this year's best, both in how the movie was made and in how it looked.  The use of special effects was kept to a minimum, which worked well for this story.  I wish they had expanded and filled the 'normal' 2 hours - there definitely was more they could have covered.  Left Behind did have a lot of exposition and character set up, but this is necessary for any first film in a series.  Left Behind: 2 will have the advantage of picking up right where this one left off.  Don't get me wrong, though, there is still a lot in the plot that grabs your attention.  It's like the book - you want to peek to see what's around the next 'page' but you have to wait until you get there!  Like I mentioned already, special effects were good (in other words, there weren't really any that popped out to this TVR major).  The score was excellent - I didn't notice it at all.  The sign of a bad musical score is that you pay attention to the music instead of the movie.  The script was done well, though I wish there had been more.  There were a couple odd lines, but what movie doesn't?  I enjoyed how it started out differently from the book - that was definitely a better starting point for a movie.
Overall, for a low budget, Christian movie, Left Behind has exceeded my expectations.  Granted, Left Behind is not a 'blockbuster' in terms of money and time spent, future Left Behinds could be - if this movie is as popular as the books.",975369600,20,1548,4.293103448275862

For persons who through adversity and discouragement have lost sight of the benefit of standing firm, and for those who have been ""thinking about"" getting serious, and for those who want to inspire others, see this movie.  Also for those who just need to remember that there is an ultimate goal and to reaffirm their value systems, this movie is an excellent reaffermation.
The movie takes complicated dynamics and puts them in simple terms that anyone can understand.  No if, ands, or buts.  The reality is just that simple.  Either you'll be taken or you'll be left behind.
The video allowed me to put some perspective to the chaos and demorilization of our governmental bodies, corporate america and every manner of workplace and society as a whole.  It provided  some understanding of childhood gone crazy, loss of critical thinking ability in individuals and the uncertainty and stress overshadowing everday lives.
I found myself happy, angry and sad; all in an hours time frame.  I cried in reflecting upon specific instances in the way we treat each other; with back-stabbing, lying, deceiving and manipulating.  I saw underlying reasons for behavior of individuals in my workplace, my family and among friends.  It is a perfect example of how we lose ourselves, allowing fear, insecurity, and a quest for excitement and power to highjack our minds and sell our souls.
There is definitely a better and simpler way to live.  If you want the hope of knowing what that is, to teach it to loved ones and to recommit to the real value of life, this movie is a great start; no special effects needed.  You be the judge.

Why didn't Hattie want to be Rayford's wife, a hero of the first novel?  She wanted to be Hattie because she has read all of the books and she knows that Hattie is still alive.  Therefore the producers will have to cast her as Hattie in the upcoming movies.  No offense to Chelsea, but what is the last movie or tv show you have seen her in.
Lastly, what is up with the guy they have cast as Nicolae?  He looks like he is about four feet tall and 120lbs.  Not too intimidating!

These books keep me turning page after page to find out what happens next. I expected the same from the movie. I really believe if the writers of this series books could get a real hollywood budget and get a script written that follows each book closely, they could create one of the biggest movie sequels ever made. The movie doesn't explain why people disappeared in the first place (which would be important if you're trying to convince non-christians to convert), it jumps around a lot, it doesn't show what people are thinking about during these situations (like the book), and it doesn't go in to any detail about the characters. I hope that I don't sound to condescending torwards the writers, actors, or anyone involved in the books or movie, because they have probably done more for the cause of christ with this story than I have to date.

Second, I've read the book, and I give it 5 stars.  My hats off to the authors - the gospel is CLEARLY stated everywhere in all the Left Behind books.
However, the movie was absolutely terrible.  People will respect you if you pay attention to detail.  This movie gets little respect.  The special effects are horrible.  Where'd the army jeep come from?  MASH?  Where'd those helmets come from?  VietNam?  Actually it all came from a very outdated prop set.  And let's not even get into the high school acting.  To those of you with the misplaced optimism that all that matters is getting the message out, well guess what, you've got to gain people's respect first.  If any of you think that the mainstream public is going to have any respect for this movie, you are badly mistaken.  It is just sad that after all the millions of dollars that the Left Behind books have made, they couldn't buy better talent to produce the movie.
The books have gained mainstream popularity because they are WELL WRITTEN, folks, NOT because of the underlying message!  If it was just the message of salvation (you know, like handing out tracts), the vast majority of people would reject it!!  Read the Bible!!  The gospel is FOOLISHNESS to those who are perishing!!  And there are many that are perishing!
This movie is going to be a laughingstock to the public just like christian music by performers who can't play a tune (which fortunately seems to be turning around lately).
Praise God that at least Jesus can relate to this new generation because the people who produced this movie sure can't!

I especially enjoyed the twists that make this movie unique to the novel with the addition of characters and the evidence being directly tied to scripture.  Those that may be bitter that the movie is not as powerful as the novels must take in consideration that for the novel to be made into a movie and yet hold all of its attributes would create a film up to 24 hours long.

638808,2,6303382347,"That's what I call productions like this, where the reach exceeds the grasp and noble intentions are frustrated.  (Previous examples include the Young Indiana Jones Chronicles).  I have really, really, liked the books despite myself, and was hoping that this would be a great production.  It's not.  In ""Roaring Lambs"" the late Bob Briner advised the aspiring Christian film-maker to not pick projects that would require massive scenery and special effects.  The producers have ignored his advice to their detriment.
There is a reason that Tom Clancy's ""Red Storming Rising"" has never been filmed, and there is a reason Tolkien fans have had to wait FORTY years to see the Lord of the Rings on the big screen.  The scope of the production is simply too enormous and the price of failure very, very high.
The thing that has made the ""Left Behind"" series a blockbuster best seller is the pleasure of seeing a valid, yet controversial system of Biblical interpretation  fully worked out in the most concrete and dramatic terms.  It's not Victor Hugo or Charles Dickens, but it is at least as good as the worst Tom Clancy and Stephen King has turned out.  What makes the books work is the use of realistic detail:  CNN, Time Magazine and the U.N. make cameo appearances.  The world is thrown in upheaval on an epic scale.  Disbelief is willingly suspended.  We are seeing our world in the not-distant future, the only thing different (the crucial difference) is that  the symbols of Revelations are entering reality.
The shoe-string budget of this movie is it's fatal flaw.  International news-gathering organizations and world institutions can only be hinted at.  Certain limited venues can be destroyed.  The illusion of reality is never sustained long enough for anyone to seriously entertain the ideas which the creators are interested in.
Its a real shame, having sat through more than my fair share of movies based on cobbled together clap trap Hollywood eschatology (going back to The Omen and beyond), I was really hoping someone would get it right.  They haven't.
Unfortunately, for the time being, the best place to see the Left Behind series will be the theater of your imagination.

As is true for any movie or book or piece of art, the way people react to them is a very personal and subjective experience, based on their own beliefs and what has happened in their lives so far. So no matter what people say in these reviews, you need to make your own decision about this movie's value. I watched it with my 11 year old daughter and one of her friends. We were all totally caught up in the characters and the story, as well as the music (we have since bought the sound track and love it!). It made us cry, and more importantly, it made us think about what we need to do as Christians to help non believers (including my husband) begin to ask the question: if all of this is true, and if Christ does return to take His believers away from the horrors of the end times, where will I be? If you believe that it could be God's will to get this movie out in as many theaters as possible and move people to change their hearts, then join in the efforts to get sponsorship for this movie in your area. All the criticism about special effects is moot since the movie producers have already enhanced those scenes for the movie release. We thought the actors were very well cast, especially Kirk Cameron as Buck Williams. It was also a treat to watch a movie that you could immerse yourself in with no worries except when it would end.

I also hope that the producers will take the risk and involve the entire book in the next movie: Tribulation Force. The movie mostly ploded along in my opinion, there was nothing in it that truly grabbed my attention, it was something that I just watched, there was nothing in it that grabbed me and made me think at all. I hope the next one will be treated with the respect this series deserves.",974678400,,857,4.535483870967742

638886,3,6303382347,"Unlike many of the people who probably watched this movie, I have not read any books in the series. I would have to say that Cloud Ten made a great effort, but I found that some parts of the movie were a bit confusing and I would have liked more details and background on Ray's family and so on. I thought the movie jumped a little and this made it difficult for someone like me who has not read the book previously. Of course not all details could have been included because of time concerns, but I would have liked some more character building to have taken place.
At the end of the movie there is a word from Kirk Cameron explaining why the movie was released first on VHS. He encourages those who view the movie now to encourage their friends to get out and see it in theaters because it is a way of spreading the gospel. I think this is great, but if I as a Christian who didn't read the book was fuzzy on the details, I wonder how a Non-Christian will understand everything that happens in this movie.
All in all it wasn't bad, I just hope Cloud Ten works on the characters and details more if they make a sequel.",974505600,,1119,4.185185185185185
638887,2,6303382347,"Let me say up front that I'm a Christian who has devoured the books. The first one, Left Behind, on which this movie is based is a thriller on par with any Ludlum or Follett novel. The fact that it deals with what I believe to be the truth, makes it even more impactful. But as far as the movie goes. I was greatly disappointed. To be fair, a 90 minute movie can not do justice to a book like Left Behind. But here's where the movie falls apart. Kirk Cameron still looks like he's 15. He's totally miscast as Buck Williams. However Brad Johnson is excellent as Rayford Steele.
The movie meanders from one scene to the next and I kept thinking that if I wasn't familiar with the story, I'd be totally lost. Part of the problem may have been the fact that neither Jerry Jenkins nor Tim LaHaye had anything to do with the screenplay. And with only 90 minutes to work with, the plot speeds along without establishing any of the characters, much less their relatioships to one another. For example, Buck and Chloe spend a total of about 5 minutes together before they make a love connection.
If you manage to sit through the whole film, you'll be really disappointed in the ending. They just ... Well... They just end it with a scene of Buck coming back to Rayford's house, following Carpathia's mind controlling murder of Stonegal and Carthern and Buck falls into Chloe's arms at the front door. That's it. That's the end! No hint of a sequel, nothing. It just ends.
As a book series ""Left Behind"" is gripping and compelling. Once you finish one book, you can't wait to start the next. But after watching ""Left Behind - The Movie"", I can only pray that they don't make another one. If you're just getting exposed to Left Behind, save your money on the Video or DVD and read the books.
Now I know why they released the film this way. If you'd paid 6 or 7 dollars to see this in a theatre, there's now way you'd schell out $30 for the DVD like I did. Even at Amazon's $20.00 price, it's not worth it. This page also has a link where people who've seen the film can sell their videos or DVD's. The resale on this is gonna be huge.
If you must have this movie in your collection, buy the video, not the DVD. The DVD has no worthwhile extras, aside from the usual Cast & Crew segment and The Making of... segment. There's no language choices and no subtitles. Oh, by the way, did I tell you I didn't like anything about this film? Blessings to you all!!!",974505600,43,2445,4.317391304347826

I was apprehensive about seeing Cameron in the ""older"" role of Buck because of the Growing Pains pictures in my head.  But as the movie rolled on, he sorta grows on you.
The special effects were not as bad as some others had thought.  You could tell the CGI stuff from other effects, but overall they were well done.  Some of the dialogue was little disconnected.  The guy that played Rosenzweig could't seem to carry a thought.  Carpathia was played very well.

So, I picked up a copy of the DVD on release day and promptly invited over the following:  a Christian who had not read all of the books, a teenager trying to make a decision who has not read the books, and a non-Christian who has not read the books.  Including myself, at the end of the movie ALL FOUR of us had enjoyed the movie a great deal!!  The response from the non-Christian was ""How do I get my hands on these books???""  The acting was much better than I had expected, and I feel that the efforts to make a mainstream film on a not-mainstream budget were very effective!  The music especially was terrific and well-placed.  My friends who had not read the books did not have trouble following the film, as several reviewers have mentioned as a potential problem.  Overall, I can't wait to show it to more friends and hopefully it will do well in the theaters in February!  This movie is exactly what our world needs right now!",974246400,4,1125,4.289099526066351
638892,1,6303382347,"""Left Behind - The Movie"" as expected is a major disapointment.
As with every Christian Apocalyptic movie that preceded it, Left Behind suffers from poor production, a poorly written script, and in this case, miscasting.
Kirk Cameron still looks like a 16 year old kid in the role 'Buck', and is unconvincing as a world renown television journalist. Brad Johnson, (by far the best actor in the film) seems a little young to be the middle aged Rayford Steele. However Chelsea Noble as 'Hattie Durham' is perfectly cast in my opinion. As the antichrist, Gordon Currie lacks charisma and the imposing stature that the character requires.
As far as production is concerned, Christian movie making has a long way to go. The special effects in the beginning attack scene look like something from a made for cable TV movie from the late 1980's. I also felt the producers did a poor job in introducing and setting up the characters. It seems as though, they are so familiar with the characters that they assume that you already know all about them.
Lastly the watered down aproach to the Gospel was very disapointing. The Name of Jesus Christ is rarely if ever mentioned (I don't recall hearing it at all). In it's place the general term of 'God' is used. I expect this kind of wishy washyness from hollywood, not from so called Christian film companies.
Overall Left Behind is a big disapointment.
The title of the latest album from the Christian rock group 'Five Iron Frenzy' seems to fit this film perfectly - ""All the hype money can buy"".",974160000,37,1534,4.727611940298507
638893,2,6303382347,"but I had hoped for more. The opening was intense and well-made. . .I was hooked! Yet there were too many drawn-out moments afterwards. All in all, I felt the acting was fine - especially Janaya Stephens as the daughter of Brad Johnson's character. The film was too short. At the end, I wasn't expecting it; it left the door open for another film, but I found myself saying, ""Where's the rest of it?"". I've learned that the next film is to be released this time next year, and is to have the title 'Tribulation Force'. This is also the title of the second book in the 'Left Behind' book series.
Let's not forget that this was made with around $17 million and that CTP is new. The first Christian film production studio. I like what they are trying to accomplish in movies, but this one is rather confusing. I prefer their $7 million ""Revelation"" (Jeff Fahey; Nick Mancuso) to this or ""Tribulation"" (Gary Busey; Nick Mancuso). It's too bad that any of these movies weren't available at my local BLOCKBUSTER video to take the place of the ""Omega Code"".
I have never read (nor even heard of) the 'Left Behind' book  series and have only known of the the movie from the web site of Cloud Ten Pictures. I decided to give it a shot. Go ahead and do so also, but try and get one for less money on e-bay. Maybe a few more to give to friends.

However, my question is, will it transfer over to audiences?
There are several points, which are not made clear, which might end up being very confusing to people, such as:
1. Just what the Eden formula is, and what it means for Israel.
2. The connection between the decimated attack and scripture, including the rapture that was made in the book.
3. Just who in the heck Carpathia is. He just appears, and although the end gives us a sense of who he might be, never once is it even mentioned that he might be the antichrist.
4. The ending. Those that have read the series know that there is more to come, but what about the rest of the world. This lack of closure might turn off some people.

It is a high quality movie, and has some great shots in it.  I rated it so highly because I enjoyed it and firmly believe in what it stands for.  I am so tired of all the violent, lustful, and evil acts portrayed in the movies today.  A lot of courage and effort went into this movie, and for that, I applaud them.  I hope that this film will send a message to Hollywood that people enjoy wholesome movies with quality content more than high budget films with no morality.

I enjoyed seeing what the authors, Tm LaHaye and Jerry B. Jenkins, chose for the roles of the people featured in the books.  A lot of the cast and crew in the movie looked like what I had expected.
This movie does not pick up all key points that were in the book and viewers not reading the book wouldn't know a couple details that were left out of the movie.  (They wouldn't have made a difference if you knew them or not.)
Overall, I enjoyed this movie for its quality content and the suspensful scenes added in here and there.  Though it is only a 90 minute flick, ""Left Behind"" is still in my top ten movies list and people I have talked to enjoyed it also.
I guarentee this movie will be loved by all and anyone who buys it will be guaranteed a winner.
I can tell that the makers of the film took time and effort in the making of this film and deserve a thumbs up in such a great performance.  I can't wait to see future movies based on the books if the authors wish to do so.

638996,3,6303382347,"After watching the movie and the additional passionate speeches by the actors and crew members, I hope their movie does well and it's message reaches a large and varied audience.
That being said I don't know how well the film will stand up by itself for audiences not benefiting from reading the book. Obviously the task of condensing the novel down into a ninety five minute movie is daunting, but I read the book and was still confused. Storylines are thinned down to the point of anorexia, with Chloe living at home at the start of the film, and Hattie already having been hired to The U.N. People not familiar with these characters may be scratching their heads wondering how a gorgeous flight attendant could be hired to such a prestigious position. Maybe frequent flier miles? The positive though is that the screenwriters have managed for the most part to give the actors credible lines of dialogue which is more than I could say for the books.
The actors physicality is all a question of opinion, but I found Brad Johnson as Rayford, and Kirk Cameron's wife, Chelsea Noble right on the money. He's a good actor that actually elevates the material, and she looks like she's in a soap opera, which for the character of Hattie isn't that far off. Kirk Cameron, of ""Growing Pains"" fame, is quite good. And speaking of ""Growing Pains"", Janaya Stephens who plays Chloe bears a creepy resemblance to his former thespian sibling Tracey Gold. The only actor I really had issues with physically was Gordon Currie as Nicolae. He has the charm and the good looks, but hardly the charisma and power necessary for the Antichrist. To me he looked more like pasty faced Michael York waiting for Liza Minnelli in the movie, ""Cabaret"". Maybe it was the accent.
On the disc/video Kirk Cameron explains the ""grass roots"" approach to why the film was released first on video. It's so the readers of the books will get out and spread the word for the folks who haven't yet read them or just have no interest in reading them. Their hope is that it will bring an entirely new group of people to the story and it's message.

638998,3,6303382347,"I must say first that I watched this movie with an open mind so that I would be able to give an unbiased review.  Being an avid movie watcher and a Christian, I was prepared for Cloud Ten Productions to not do the book justice.  The initial flush that I felt was that they did a fairly good job with it.  A VERY brief overview of the movie is as follows:  The Bible talks about Jesus returning to take Christians to heaven and that there will be a 7 year period of chaos in which He will unleash several judgments upon the earth.  Left Behind is about the actual return of Christ and a brief period after His return.  How good is the movie?  The following is my rating of it (everything is based on a 1-10 scale):
 Actual overall movie (best picture award?  No):  7   Acting (in general): 7  Talked about how to become a Christian: 9   Script: 6   Kept to the book: 7  Rating against any other Christian movie: 10  Directing: 8
Specific Actors  Kirk Cameron (Buck Williams):  8   Brad Johnson (Rayford Steele): 8   Chelsea Noble (Hattie Durham): 8  Clarence Gilyard (Bruce Barnes): 6  Colin Fox (Chaim Rosenzweig): 9   Gordon Currie (Nicolae Carpathia): 8  Janaya Stephens (Chloe Steele): 7
The actor who portrayed Ken Ritz did an excellent job.  His small part was actually my favorite part of the movie.  Anyone who watches the film will enjoy him.  One of the disappointments of the movie was the fact that it left out some of the key elements of the book.  For example, the chaos after the Christians were taken was played WAY down.  I won't say anymore because I don't want to give anything away.  To be honest, I really don't know how understandable the movie was from the standpoint of someone who had never read the book.  I kept ""filling"" in the missing parts.  Final thoughts.  As the movie progressed, I was able to ""get into"" it more.  Although Gordon Currie did a decent job acting, I think there could have been a better choice for Carpathia.  It did do a decent job portraying the gospel.  For the budget of the movie, I think that they did a really good job, compared to what others with same budget would do.  I would love to see what they could do with a double or tripled budget for the next book.  One small thing I would like to see changed is the credits.  Yes, it's small, but it looked like someone did them in Word 2000 or something.  Will I go to the theater to watch it?

The fact is, many in our world are as ignorant of Holy Scripture and the reality of Christ's return as those depicted in this movie. It realistically depicts the fact that many of our church members are really good at the knowledge, but they don't have the belief that comes with a personal relationship with Christ. It took me 35 years of my life to come to that relationship, I pray a movie such as 'Left Behind' will reach this generation long before they reach 35.

Besides, what is it with these evangelical action flicks...why do they always pick the lamest lead actor available? In ""Omega Code,"" it was Casper Van Dien, whose only starring role was in ""Starship Troopers"" (classic line: ""This planet crawls!""). Now it's Kirk Cameron from ""Growing Pains""...couldn't they have gotten Alan Thicke to play the antichrist?
On a serious note...I certainly respect Christian theology, though I disagree with it. But it's hard to maintain that respect when their theology is being crammed down your throat sideways, as it is in this film.
Moreover, other films about the same type of Satan/antichrist/apocalypse subject matter (""The Exorcist,"" ""Rosemary's Baby,"" ""The Omen"") were entertaining without being preachy. I suspect that the goal of the producers of this film (i.e., getting ""the word"" out) could have been achieved without preaching, and that's too bad, because this could have been a much better film - and reached a far broader audience with its message - without the Jack Van Impe tone.

The rapture and seven years in itself is a very exciting story to be told.  But the movie, like the book, just captures 1/12 of the excitement.  I doubt there will be 11 more movies, so they should have tried to add a little more biblical prophecy into this one.
The actors were good, but they just didn't have much to work with.  I guess I wish they would have focused more on the characters discovering what the Bible said happened and their reactions to what is going to happen.",973468800,9,1148,4.267281105990784

However, I was a little disappointed after seeing the movie.  I think that it needed to give more details about what was going on because if you are a non-believer and you are not familiar with the Bible, then you are not going to understand what is going on during this movie.  Also, I feel that it should have shown more of what will(or what we think) will happen during that 7 year period so that people will really think about their own lives and want to make a change if they need to. The actors did a good job in this movie, but the movie overall what not as powerful as I had expected.  Please keep up with the movies though because even if you only reach a few people, then that is better than reaching none.",973468800,,884,4.301204819277109

(Me too ) It was a good translation from the book. The story is riveting. It starts out with action. Then goes to ""slice of life"" and picks up from there. The portrails of the main characters are realistic and believable. If you liked the Book - see the move - If you liked both - Read the Book (Bible)",973468800,2,440,4.116279069767442

The movie is action-packed, suspenseful, and frightening.  I watched it with my husband who hasn't read the books.  We both believe this movie will attract non-Christians to the theater and leave them asking questions.
I think the quality of the production is excellent.  However, some of the acting tends to be a bit dry.  I think Clarence Gilyard's portrayal of Bruce Barnes, a pastor who knew it and taught it, but never actually believed it, was fantastic.

639166,2,6303382347,"First of all let us start off by saying that we were very disappointed in the movie-- especially after such an excellent novel.  The presentation of the video tape was well done.  The only problem is that the cover was eye catching, but the pretty box was better than what waw contained inside the box!
The biblical inaccuracy and deviation from the novel were confusing particularly for those unknowledgeable of the Word and it cheats the viewer out of many dramatic images so incredibly portrayed by the book.  The movie had all of the characters familiar with each other from the beginning, which left little room for any type of character development whatsoever.  Buck's tongue interpretation of the stranger in the wheat fields as well as his encounter and stand against the anti-christ is incomprehensible considering Buck wasn't even saved until the last scene of the movie.  The special effects left a bit to be desired as the helicopters looked like locusts and the tanks like toys.  The money they spent on the video's box should have been put into production of the movie itself instead.
It was obvious that the producers attempted to cram the best selling novel into an hour and a half but they did not succeed.  It is disappointing because the core message of the project is that Jesus saves and has plans for His people.  Oh well. . .With the novel, we couldn't wait to get to the next page;  but with the movie, we reached the end and felt like we should not have spent the $30, and instead, should have left the movie behind!

Indeed, I have been a fan of the left behind series for its story telling of end-times.  My fellow Christians Christ will return.  As far as the book is concerned, It is right to the point.  It conveys the message behind it.  The movie conveys all the literary themes that the series covers.  Yes, it is true that the movie only had a few bible quotes, but the fact of the matter is the whole story is linear to what will happen, according to the bible.  I refuse to tell the plot to anyone reading this review.  I simply ask you to get a chance to see it.  It is a thoughtful attempt to replicate the book, but by the same token-- the movie is a story telling-nutshell of what will happen if you are ""Left Behind.""",973382400,2,885,4.245508982035928

(And I have read all of them thus far save for ""The Mark"") The fact that we are saved by grace though faith in Jesus Christ alone was not adequately presented.  Instead, the focus was on the dissappearances and who was behind them.  Little thought was realy gone into the why.
I'm an Amillennialist. I enjoy the books as ficton.  I see both the Law and Gospel within them and am glad of that.  However, I did not find that within this film.  The name of Jesus Christ was mentioned only once. Now, true, I have read the writers did so in order not to be ""preachy"".  But it's a bit sad when Christians refuse to proclaim Jesus's name.

I was very excited to hear that one of my favorite books was going to come out in movie form, but it didn't live up to my expectations.  The plot was a bit too choppy (I had to explain quite a few things to some people I watched it with who had never read the book before), the special effects were mediocre, and the script could be corny at times.  I guess you have to expect some of that in a movie with just a $17 million budget and 1 1/2 hours to tell a 468 page story, but if they would have taken just another half hour I think they could have tied it together a little better.  To the film's credit, I was very impressed with the cast.  Nicolae, Buck, Chloe, and Rayford's personalities and mannerisms were exactly as I had imagined them when reading the book; Hattie and Bruce were quite a huge surprise- Chelsea Noble and Clarence Gilyard did an outstanding job with their characters.  My hope is that a bigger studio with more money will see this and pick up on the fact that they could take this series and run with it, without jeopardizing the content and message in the books.",973296000,3,1157,4.236363636363636

In spite of what some may feel, by not explaining the Rapture up front for ""non-christians"" only lent to the suspense of the event. The movie, though not as extravagant as some of the major blockbusters, offers a good message along with decent special effects. I find in movies such as this, the actors have to portray more and not rely a lot on the special effects to carry them through .Some of the other Tribulation movies, such as ""A Distant Thunder"" while good ,did not capture the moment like this one. Of course, being a christian, I was able to get into the story quite well. I feel that movies such as this ( no sex, no drugs, no filth, etc.) are long overdue. I find this movie refreshing and would reccomend it to anyone looking for a movie with a message. Frankly, I am not one of those ""fanatics""who would get this movie because of the message alone. The ""fanatics"" are those who support awfully made movies with little redeeming value. This movie rates all the way around.

The Gospel was way watered down, but I have to wonder if perhaps the key to reaching unsaved with a movie has to do with making them seek answers to questions this movie may stir up.  There should have been a better set up at the beginning with what it was that Irene was talking to Ray and Cloe about, however.  Overall, the movie was good as a video or made for TV movie.  I can't really see it doing well on the big screen, although the subject matter is the kind that pulls people in.

I almost walked out as Gilyard's character was ""realizing"" his situation. His acting is not convincing at all (I was expecting better of him) but I don't know if he could have helped it as his lines were not written as if coming from a man in his position. Few of the characters seem three dimensional, Buck being a surprising exception. Also, Carpathia's accent rarely sounds East European, but perhaps it will pass for the unsuspecting. The portrayal of Jews in the movie is not done particularly well either. The most prominent Jewish character, Chiam, is a dupe who is portrayed as a starry-eyed and naive. Also, anyone who watches this should be aware that there are MANY different interpretations of the prophecies concerning the rapture. So, please read, and think, about them for yourself.",973296000,4,974,4.735294117647059
639253,3,6303382347,"As my wife is an avid fan of the Left Behind book series, I purchased a copy of the movie two nights ago and sat down and watched. As a story, the premise has a lot of promise; as a movie, it runs a bit slow and has weak production values. Overall, however, I would still recommend the film to anyone who needs a decent family film to watch.
Overall, the film is good, but I was hoping for something more. To be perfectly fair, it is much better than most Christian genre, low budget movies that have come out over the past few years. The acting, overall, is good, and the special effects, for the most part, are authentic. As such, this one rates about the same as movies like the Omega Code: great for a Christian movie / about average for movies in general.
One of the difficulties I had with the movie was the inability to suspend belief. As a film and video major, it was easy to spot that the camera Buck (Kirk Cameron) uses in the desert has no 'live' capabilities, yet is used for a live broadcast. I also had a lot of problem with the staged accident scene after the rapture.
Unfortunately, this is how the rest of the movie plays out as well. To be fair, most people will not recognize these mistakes. And, it certainly isn't any worse than the rest of the tripe that Hollywood has pounded over the past few years.
One area that I was hoping would be better was the production values of the film. This film suffers from the same plague that most low budget films suffer from. As this could be the video transfer, I will use the discount coupons to see the film in the movie theater when it comes out before passing judgement.
If I were asked if I would recommend this film, I would have to say yes. Despite some slow moments, the film has a good story line, decent special effects and, despite my problems with suspension of belief, it is a story you can watch with the whole family without the fear of your two year old picking up some interesting new words.",973296000,6,1969,4.281501340482574
639254,5,6303382347,"It seems like most people give a film 5 stars just because they really like the movie. But only a film that stands out as one of the best films ever made actually deserves 5 stars. Left Behind has earned every single one of them. I'm not just saying this because I'm a Christian or because it has the Left Behind name on it. If I wasn't a Christian, I'm sure I would still love the movie and learn from it.  I do not think there is anything in the film that can be criticized. I have noticed that some reviewers have attacked its special effects and low budget. The special effects are not impressive but it doesn't matter. Usually when a film's success depends on special effects, you get a mediocre script and acting. Be thankful that this didn't happen to Left Behind.
  I think Chuck Anziulewicz's point of view was very interesting but I totally disagree with it and anyone else with a similar opinion. He implied that Left Behind was fictional. Of course  that is not true. The movie even said so. If this movie and the Bible does not convince you then what will? What if the event portrayed in the movie were to happen next week (it is very possible)? You would be left behind just like Buck, Rayford, Chloe, and Bruce. Do you want to risk that? Chuck's review sounded just like Buck before he was changed in the movie. I probably sound like I am ""slapping you over the head"" but why wait?
  Now back to the movie. Left Behind really lives up to the book. The story has been switched around a little bit but it doesn't hurt the movie. The plot and climax are still the same.  I had never heard of any of the actors except for Kirk Cameron until now but they all do a great job. All the characters act almost exactly as I imagined them while reading the book. Buck has always been my favorite character and Kirk Cameron does a great job playing him. The music is the best Christian music I have ever heard. The soundtrack must be good.
  Left Behind is my new favorite movie with Jurassic Park closely following.",973209600,9,2018,4.345744680851064
639255,5,6303382347,"You know how when something touches your heart, you cant help but get teary eyed? For me this movie did just that. Being a very active movie goer has taught me to appreciate quality films.  Because of this, simple summer action films don't cut it for me anymore. This however, is not one of them.
As for the technical aspects: In some of the other reviews, people have mentioned that the acting wasn't great, or that the special effects weren't so hot, and even outdated. First, I had no problem with any of the actors at all, and not once thought that anything was underdone. I know for a fact that Kirk Cameron is a born again christian, and therefore passionate in his role. Secondly, LEFT BEHIND did not use any kind of new technology in breakthrough special effects. Lately, someone in a studio comes up with a new computer technique to make a cool special effect and the company then builds a movie around it.  I am very glad that this isn't the case. In LEFT BEHIND the story, content, and message are what makes it so great, not breakthrough technology.
I know that any true christian will love this movie. Why? Because in this movie God touches peoples lives directly through the Bible, and I have never seen a mainstream movie take this approach.  If you have seen movies like END OF DAYS or STIGMATA, you know that these movies are based on religion, but God's message ends there and suspense takes over. Also in comparison, THE OMEGA CODE was a leap in the right direction but doesn't come close to describing Gods love as LEFT BEHIND.
Final thought: Its sad that the people can choose a depressing, bloody, and demented movie like American Beauty as Movie of the Year because of its CONTENT, when in fact a movie more like LEFT BEHIND should be in its place for that very reason...CONTENT.",973209600,21,1802,4.555555555555555

If I had known I would have saved myself a few dollars in the long run. Cameron and the other main actors were good. And as a Christian,I will pray that the movie does well in theaters despite my opinion.

639258,4,6303382347,"First let me say that EVERY character was casted to perfection!!  Especially Kirk Cameron... THERE COULD NOT BE A BETTER BUCK!  Rayford (played by the former Marlboro Man) couldn't have been more perfect... definitely the kind of guy you would picture as being an ""I'm a hunk who could have it all"" kind of guy (pre-rapture of course).  I've seen a few reviews criticizing the choice for Carpathia, but I disagree.  After all, wouldn't we all just EXPECT the Anti-Christ to be of a ""strong and powerful"" stature?  A perfect example of the wolf who came in sheep's clothing.  Bravo for all the choices of character portrayals!!
I felt the movie lost one of it's possible 5 stars for falling short in 3 areas; the first being in not demonstrating the more far reaching effects of the rapture.  The scenes they did show were EXTEMELY powerful, but it just fell a bit short on the full scale (where were the downed planes, the miles of jammed highways, etc?)... due to the limited budget, however, it can be easily overlooked and left to the imagination.  Another area I felt was a little weak was that they tried to squeeze too much information into 90 minutes.  Why not go 2 hours, or more, the way most movies are doing?  Characters and ideas were too often just tossed into the loop without enough explanation and the viewer who has never read the book might have a bit of difficulty following. But the main area I felt the movie fell short was in its salvation message.  There really seemed to be no clear direction as to what is salvation and how to receive it(which the books delve into continually.... no missing the message there!).  However, knowing that this movie is hoping to catch the eyes of the general public, it is understandable that the producers may have been a bit fearful of turning off viewers and instead hoped to merely raise the questions of ""what if?"" and ""could it really happen?"" and ""how do I get that one way ticket to Heaven?"".
Over all, a fantastic movie that leaves you wanting more and asking yourself, ""when's the next one coming out?""",973209600,,2068,4.604904632152588
639259,2,6303382347,"Having read all 7 of the books currently in the ""Left Behind"" series I knew that bringing even just one of the books to the screen was going to be a huge task.
On a scale of 1 to 10 this movie get a 6 in covering the content of the book. However, it gets only a 2 in covering the message of the book and a 0 for presenting the Gospel. For those who have not read the book it would be hard to tie the individual scenes together to discover the plot progression or the ""why"" behind the events taking place. For those who haven't read the Bible and are not thinking in terms of the rapture... they would be (and are) 'left behind' by the movie.
I think the screenplay writers were so familiar with the content of the book they simply forgot to put vital information into the script. Case in point, in the introduction of Rayford and Chloe the two of them could have discussed the rapture as part of their discussion about ""mom's strange beliefs."" This would have given the audience a chance to understand the significance of the vanishings as well as Rayford's reaction to what he knew when he was the ""empty cloths"" all over the place.  The only use of scripture to tie this whole story to the Bible was the brief quotation of some Old Testament passages while ""Buck"" was being patched-up in the church office.  As for the acting... Kirk Cameron was surprisingly good in his roll (I couldn't imagine anyone doing a better job at being ""Buck"").
Chelsea Noble was too on the ball and intelligent to be the ""Hattie"" of the book but did a good job in making her ""Hattie""  a deep character. Brad Johnson was too young to be a believable senior 747 captain and his acting was a bit stiff. Gordon Currie... good pick for the anti-Christ! He played the deceiver very well. The others all did an average job in their rolls. However, some of the ""extras"" in the crowd scenes are fun to watch!
The special effects were very good for the budget allowed and the sets were fairly realistic (except the 747 with a cockpit crew of only 2).
Overall, this is a good movie to borrow from a friend. Or, you could be that friend and get a copy to lend out. As for being a box office smash... well if the producers go back and get some of the scenes off the cutting room floor they might be able to hold the interest of those who are not hooked on the book and already bought the video.",973209600,26,2362,4.267857142857143
639339,4,6303382347,"Being a Christian, I am intrigued by the Left Behind series and it's fictional interpretation of Revelations.  While the first Left Behind DVD was enjoyable, I found the lack of captioning and 5.1 or DTS sound options to be a minus.  On the other hand, the script, acting, and the theme were a very good interpretation of the original book.  To be able to interpret each book and put them into a movie format would most likely mean a film of about 5-6 hours per film.  The screenplay was well condensed and did raise the all-important, soul searching questions that have plagued non- believers consciences since God created mankind.

There is NO closed captioning, either ""on disc"" or via the normal closed captioning that most shows have, where your TV intereprets the closed captioning signal.  This made it hard for my mother in law to follow along, since she is older and hard of hearing. It didn't help that the sound editing was very poor, making a good bit of the dialogue fuzzy and hard to understand.  The set lighting was pretty dark, and there were unusual shadows, and overall a pretty washed out look.  It reminded me in production values of most ""made for TV"" movies that I have ever seen.  The aspect ratio was 4:3, and I wonder what it will be if it ever makes it to theatres.  The acting was OK, considering most of these actors are somewhat veterans of small parts in soap operas and sit coms, and movie bit parts.  One or two bits of acting were truly bad, especially the second-in-command money guy, whose name I can't recall.  Everyone was very earnest, and it was nice that they all wanted to make this movie with a great Christian message, but somehow the great Christian message just did not come through as I saw it.  The movie itself is extremely mediocre. The CGI effects with the warplanes looked very obviously CGI.  Some of the explosions were pretty good, especially the car explosion.  The budget on this was only $17 million as I understand.  They needed about twice that, better actors, better production talent, and so forth.  I tend to think that this will be the only movie that gets made from this series of books.  I seriously doubt that their plan of filling theatres in February will be successful, because I don't think many people will shell out again for the theatre after dropping money for the DVD or tape.  When I bought this DVD it was a choice between this movie or Titan A.E.  I am pretty sure I made the wrong choice.
Those of you who will violently disagree with this review, ask yourself a simple question.  Did you really think the movie was all that good or are you just entranced with the subject matter. Sometimes it is hard to admit that you can make a bad movie about a good subject, and a good or great movie about a bad subject (e.g. Schindler's List or The Godfather).
One comment by one of the principals in the ""making of"" featurette really gave me a giggle. She said something to the effect that this was the most expensive, involved lavish production of a Christian movie ever.  I just wonder if she ever saw ""The Ten Commandments.""

First of all, the book is complicated, very complicated. The main characters move through such intricate events that to really bring a 100% adaptation, would mean the movie would probably have to be around 2 or more hours...that just isn't realistic. I forgive the movie makers for having to tighten the character ties...that is just how some things have to be. In my honest opinions, the actors do a wonderful job in portraying the unique characters (that are a bit of us...we're all a bit like Rayford, Buck, etc... even in our best of moments, some times we are egotistical, questioning, mad, etc...that's why so many love the series, because the characters are real)...and that's why I love the movie...
I have already bought four extra copies, given two away as presents. The message toward the meaning and the power of the Church and the evil of Satan... most of all, the meaning of the end times...

If you really think about it, you can identify Jonathan Stonagal and Joshua Cothran's real-life counterparts, and the banking corporations they head.  So scoff however you like, but how do you really know that a plan, just like the one described in this film, hasn't already been set in motion?
Turn now to the Middle East.  The rhetoric gets hotter all the time, doesn't it?  And Russia is ALREADY mixing in.  How soon before they and their Arab allies scramble their entire air force to erase Israel off the map?  Furthermore--what is the center of the dispute this time?  Ah, yes--the Temple precincts.
Finally, I leave you with the new ""Digital Angel"" intradermal GPS transceiver now coming to market, ready for every man, woman and child to receive one and be trackable wherever they go.  ""And he causeth all, both rich and poor, small and great, free and bond, to receive a [cattle brand] on their foreheads, or their right hands,...""
As ""Dirk Burton"" says heatedly to ""Buck Williams,"" it all fits.  As I said--watch it now, while you can be sure that it's still fiction.",973123200,,1913,4.843076923076923
639346,4,6303382347,"Based upon the best selling book series of the same  name, this movie obviously has some big shoes to fill. Has it done it?  Yes and no.  As far as the storyline goes, it has stuck, with a few exceptions, to the  storyline of the first book in the ""Left Behind"" series.
 Kirk Cameron turns in a magnificent performance as Buck Williams.  Gordon Currie turns in one fine performance as the man that will epitomize all evil-the Anti-Christ. Clarence Gilyard turns in an excellent performance as well.
 For a small budget, this movie fares quite well.  The scene of the planes exploding over Israel, though, is not exactly up to par, but other than that, special effects, etc. are all quite good.
 Should you buy this?  That's a matter of personal choice, but I would highly recommend it.  This has so much more going for it than other Christian movies of the past (I'm thinking in terms here of the ""late night"" offerings of our local VTN station) and is well worth a look.",973123200,7,971,4.522988505747127

I felt that the movie was so good that I ended the movie wanting to see more.  I felt that the cast did a wonderful job of portraying the characters, and most of all I feel that the writers of the screenplay did an excellent job keeping with the book.  Many times the writers tend to let us down going from book to movie, but everyone is to be commended for the way they stuck to the book.  If you haven't read the series I suggest that you buy this movie or read the series it is well worth you time.  Good work to all involved it the movie it was great.",973036800,,663,3.992424242424242

HIS PORTRAYAL OF BUCK WAS EMOTIONAL AND REAL AND REMINDS ME OF MY DAILY STRUGGLE IN A WORLD AGAINST MY VERY EXISTENCE. GORDON CURRIE WAS A VIVID AND EXACT PICTURE OF WHAT I THINK THE ANTICHRIST WILL BE A YOUNG GORGEOUS VIBRANT INTELLIGENT MAN WHO IS ABLE TO PULL THE WOOL OVER ALL EXCEPT THOSE WHO ARE BELEVERS IN JESUS.

I bought this as a gift for my wife with no intentions of even watching it.  But I did give it a chance. I was instantly turned off by the full-screen ratio.  However two minutes into it, I was really hooked.  It does comes across as more of a slick t.v pilot than a theatrical release.  At the end though, I was ready for another installment.  With all the legal red-tape involving the authors, I don't know how likely future movies will be. However if they make'em, I'll buy'em.  Also, a note to Cloud Ten:  there's nothing wrong with making a HIGH QUALITY ""straight-to-video"" movie series.  So if Feb. 2nd doesn't meet your expectations.

Having said that, I want to say this is a great movie.  Don't watch it trying to pick all of their deviations from the book, just enjoy and watch.  All of the actors did a great job.  I was glad that the movie covers the first book and only the first book, It keeps everything in line, but this may make it feel like an abrupt ending for those who have not read the books.",973036800,2,543,4.046728971962617
639381,4,6303382347,This was great. Many people will be upset because it doesn't follow exactly with the books. But if it did it would take like fifteen hours to get through the movie. They did a great job re-writing the script. It is still a wonderfull ministry tool and that is what it is for! I gave it four stars because I could have handled it being a little bit longer!,973036800,,355,4.159420289855072
639382,4,6303382347,"I have read the first two of the ""Left Behind"" series and they are pretty good.  I own all seven already published and am awaiting the eighth to add to my collection.  Also, I've purchased the books for other people and they love them.  But I think the movie, the screenplay behind it, was far better than the books!  I'll probably start giving copies of the movie to my friends who are interested in this subject.
Some of the conversations in the book were too animated and awkward for my tastes.  Like any movie, the screenplay reads a bit differently than the book, but I think they did the ""story"" justice here in the film.  The action sequences are good, the characters are generally believable and the story doesn't lose focus.
As webmaster for a Bible prophecy website, ..., and a Gospel website..., I am very familiar with pre-millennial Bible Prophecy, the Gog-Magog War of Ezekiel 38-39, the rise of the Man of Lawlessness and Christianity.  The producers treated all of these subjects fairly well without being heavy-handed, preachy or corny.  Nicolae Carpathia's ruthless actions at the United Nations was done far better than that written in the book.
So I give it 4 stars.  Kirk Cameron handles his role better than our expectations of him from his 1980's sitcoms.  Kirk's wife, Chelsea Noble also does a fine job.  Brad Johnson as Rayford Steele is excellent casting.  Clarence Gilyard has come a long way since ""Top Gun"" as pastor Bruce Barnes (can you believe Gilyard is 45 years old?!?!).  Colin Fox is a favorite of mine from the ""Psi Factor"" TV series; here he's Chaim Rosenweig and easily believable as the breakthrough scientist.  Gordon Currie didn't win me over in the trailer but in the movie I came to accept his performance as the Antichrist, a true wolf in sheep's clothing.  And the Jonathan Stonagal character was decently portrayed as a globalist, capitalist who utilizes world hunger and drought to his advantage.
There are a few scenes that probably warranted another take or two, but I think generally you'll enjoy the film.  If you like the book I think you'll love the movie.  It certainly ranks as one of the best, if not the best, Christian prophecy movie we've seen so far.  I expect it will do well in theaters February, 2001.  But you don't have to wait; order it now!",972950400,6,2309,4.713216957605985
639383,5,6303382347,"I watched Left Behind The Movie this evening.  It is a fantastic Christian movie.  The best made yet.  Very professional with good acting.  Kirk Cameron is wonderful.  It may not be Star Wars but it's not meant to be.  It's based on the Christian belief of the ""Rapture"" where Believers are taken in the ""twinkle of an eye"" to Heaven.  These characters were ""left behind"" and must deal with the world.  The books are outstanding and the movie follows pretty closely.  However, to be as precise as the book, we'd be watching a 6 hour movie...they were very faithful to the theme.  Don't miss this whether you believe or not!",972950400,,623,4.581818181818182
639384,4,6303382347,"It almost hurt to put the DVD in the machine.  I wanted so badly for the movie to be good.  Even passable would have been ok.  Why?  Because the ""Christian"" themed movies that I have sampled in the past have mostly been disappointments.  Can you say ""Omega Code""?  The Left Behind Movie was anything but a disappointment!
Admittedly the film did have a small budget and a huge challenge in doing the book series justice as an adaptation.  All things considered Cloud Ten did a great job.  Am I cutting the film some critical slack because I badly want it to win?  Sure, a little.  But no more than most people would give to any budget challenged independent film.
As for the ""video-before-theatrical"" release concept?  Very gutsy.  Then again the whole project was gutsy.  Will I go and see it again in the theatre in February?  Absolutely...  I plan on bringing a ton of friends and I hope you do too!",972950400,,902,4.515527950310559
639385,1,6303382347,"Never before have the motives of the producers of a motion picture been more transparent. Let's see: FIRST, they get every willing televangelist to hype this film as the greatest thing since sliced white bread. NEXT, they encourage as many fundamentalist Christians as possible to purchase copies of the film so as to recoup its paltry production costs and pump up its advertising budget. And FINALLY, when the film hits the theaters, get as many said Christians as possible to see it yet again, bus them into the multiplexes if necessary, NOT on the merits of the film itself, but because a #1 box office opening will be seen as some sort of profound spiritual victory.
But THAT, of course, won't be enough. I imagine that any film critic with the audacity to give ""Left Behind"" anything short of a glowing review will be deemed ""anti-Christian.""
Of course, this shamelessly manipulative marketing campaign shouldn't surprise anyone. It is, after all, good old fashioned Capitalism at work. What DOES surprise me is how many people have been suckered into the whole ""Left Behind"" mindset. As someone who tries to balance his spiritual beliefs with some sense of reason and rationality, it leaves me scratching my head. It would appear that there are many, MANY people who actually believe that sometime in the near future a ""Rapture"" is going to occur, and that millions of people all over the Earth are going to simultaneously vanish INTO THIN AIR. What kind of reality, I wonder, are these people living in? Is this ""Rapture"" something they actually believe in, or is it something they fervently WANT to believe in?
In a way, I almost wish that such an event would occur! What an interesting day that would be! What would be even more interesting is if the Apocalypse were to occur in a more spectacular fashion, not in the anthropomorphical sense the authors of the ""Left Behind"" series have portrayed, but as more of a Stephen Spielberg production, with boiling clouds, trumpets, angels descending out of the sky, Moon turned to blood, the whole nine yards. Imagine coming to the realization that it was all coming true, just as the evangelists had been warning for years, and that there was something more awesome than just the cold, hard, physical reality we inhabit. Wouldn't THAT be something???
Yet in the final analysis, it's that cold, hard, physical reality that I will content myself with. My life is not so meaningless that I need the fear of a ""Rapture"" and the ""End Times"" to make sense of it all ... nor do I need Heaven or Hell to bribe me into behaving decently, thank you very much.",972950400,7,2603,4.773835920177383

The movie has it's moments, but overall it's slow, it deviates from the plot, and the effects are B-rated at best. We all wanted this movie to succeed, because we all loved the series. And we all wanted this movie to succeed because we all believe in the message. But this movie fell short of what it could have really been--as a movie and a message. Loyal readers especially will feel disappointed.
Perhaps the producers were just counting on the ""fanatical followers"" of this series to be an ""untapped billion dollar resource"" in preselling the videos. Too bad they didn't use that resource to make this movie what it could have been.",972950400,28,794,4.638297872340425
639388,2,6303382347,"I can only imagine and hope that the above review title is what LaHaye and Jenkins can say about the screenplay.  To be fair, to turn book one into a movie was a very difficult task.  Secondly, the acting was OK.  Thirdly, for any movie production to stick to a mostly literal Biblical interpretation was admirable.  However.....to say that the film is ""incredible"" or ""anointed"" is going way too far.  Count the number of times ""Jesus"" or ""Christ"" is mentioned throughout the whole film and the BEST one could say is they got a taste of ""Gospel Lite"".  Most viewers will leave this movie still wondering why people are really going to be raptured.  The scenes tend to shift wildly throughout the movie, hurting the flow.  The most moving part of the book (my opinion), when Rayford returns to his home pretty much knowing what he'll find, is well preserved.  Overall, non-Christians will feel it's too preachy, real Christians will say ""where's the Gospel?"".  A nice try, but stick to the books.",972864000,16,996,4.738372093023256

Well they broke their record because this movie was very interesting. Naturaly it wasn't as good as the book. But it comes very close. This movie explains alot and it portrays the book VERY acurately, maybe they took some shortcuts, but that doesnt mess with the quality.

639441,2,6303382347,"Sat down and watched this creation of celluloid last night.  Hmmmm, I guess all those millions of dollars these authors are making aren't taking their chances of losing any of those dollars after looking at the quality of this half-baked movie version of the popular series.  It's kinda sad, I love the books!  The soundtrack is really good too and you would think the premise of this film would inspire many to support it's cause.  Unfortunately, this movie falls on it's face halfway through the film.  This movie requires more action and suspense if you're going to market a film of apocalyptic proportions to win the masses into theatres come February.  I do have to say that the Michael W Smith song in this movie is hands down one of the best songs Michael has ever written.  This movie starts out really well though.  Plenty of action and suspense.  It just loses steam concentrating too much on Rayford Steeles quest for faith.  Kirk Cameron does fine in this movie!  He fits the character of Buck Williams to a T!  I think they need to concentrate the film more on Kirk Cameron in future films.  I also think the characters need to be (I hate to say it) ""more sinful.""  I understand how people would want to steer kids away from this movie but the characters that are ""left behind"" just don't fit the mold of clean mouthed do-gooders gone bad.  The characters need to be much more raw than what is shown here.  Nicolae is a bit disappointing as well.  He's too skinny and weak looking.  When I read the book Left Behind the first time, I visioned someone like Christian Bale playing the role of Nicolae.  He just has that boy next door, cute and innocent but scary as hell quality he so wonderfully possessed in American Psycho. Overall this movie is somewhat entertaining for the simple fullfilment of seeing what's envisioned from a book to seeing it in a movie.  If plans are to create sequels, they need to stick to the straight to video format for now and stay away from theatres because this movie doesn't ride this story simply on entertainment (which is what theatres really are for).  This movie rides on a message that needs to be addressed in churchs, schools, between friends and family.  That just can't happen in a theatre since most people are not going to a theatre to be preached to, which this movie to some degree does.  Proceed with caution.",972345600,21,2370,4.59047619047619

I cannot say the same for the film. The film tries HARD but misses the mark. Kirk Cameron puts in a decent performance as Buck Williams and Chloe is also played well.... but Rayford Steele? Who is this guy? It is one of the WORST performances I have ever seen in my life. I laughed out loud as he delivered some of his lines. For someone who was supposed to have just met the Creator of heaven and earth, he was surprisingly stoic...
I could go on... but why? The filmmakers tried. It wasn't a complete waste, but if you haven't read the book, prepare to be LOST. They crammed 400 pages into 95 minutes...

I have been reading the Left Behind books for over two years now, and I have been EXTREMELY impressed with them.  Never have I read such an intriguing and amazing story.  I have read other end-time stories, but none like this one.
So, when I found out there was going to be a movie, I was excited, but a bit afraid that they would mess up the story, the characters, but most importantly, the message.  I decided that judging the characters' acting ability, based on their looks, was a pretty faulty judgment system.  I decided that, if they played the part well, I would forgive their ""falling short"" in the looks department.
Well, on Sunday the 15th, I was in for a big surprise.  Never have I seen actors who portrayed the parts in a book SO WELL.  The plot was excellently written, the directing, the acting, the emotion, drama, everything - was absolutely incredible.

After completing the other 6 books currently released in a little over a month, I found myself totally committed to the characters and emotionally and spiritually connected to this story.  I am so looking forward to this movie release, not because I feel the directors and producers will be artistically correct, or that the actors will put on an Oscar winning performance, but because the writers and people involved are anointed of God.  Even if the acting is horrible, you still cannot keep from being moved by the Holy Spirit while watching.  I went to a Left Behind convention here in Dallas on October 17th, and Kirk Cameron was there with his wife, and Clay Crosse, and Bob Carlisle, and Russ Lee, and Amy WIlliams, and Jake.

Starting with Christ's Rapture of his church the book lives up  to it's title in the first chapter while the rest of the series unfolds to  tell the story of the main characters, good and evil, and their trials  during the tribulation period that will ensue during the End Times.  I have  seen several extended previews for this movie and what I have seen looks  good.  The only problems I have seen so far are perhaps the actors, most of  which I have never heard.  I hope they will do their parts justice.  Also,  I hate to see story lines changed in the book to movie transition and I  have already noticed several of these changes.  I do look forward to seeing  this movie but I would suggest that anyone who wants to see it should read  the novels first if they have not already done so.
