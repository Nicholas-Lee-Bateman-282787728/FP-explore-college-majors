8210132,4,B000TM0ME8,"Excellent Swedish performance of te musical with the story line being one of the best if  not the best. Two issues DVD is in Swedish with no subtitles and format is not US standard.
I managed to reformat the original copy and have enjoyed the version very much because I am so familiar with the story and songs.
It is like watching a live opera without the libretto. Wish they would publish a translation to follow along. If they did or added English subtitles and format, I believe this would be the definitive version. The sets are outstanding.",1425600000,2,546,4.571428571428571
