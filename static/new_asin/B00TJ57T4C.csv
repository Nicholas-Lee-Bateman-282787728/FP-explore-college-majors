7010905,2,B00TJ57T4C,The acting is certainly not good. It's not terrible but not good. The CGI isn't very good either. It's pretty noticeable but honestly only slightly distracting. What got to me the most was the fight scenes. They use multiple camera angles to speed up the fight scenes but it's not enough. It's painfully slow. Worse than WWE slow and completely unbelievable. The clothing looked none too different from bad Halloween costumes. I wasn't too distracted from the costumes but there were times were I had to roll my eyes. The speed of how everything took place was distracting. How fast someone got away and how fast they sailed. Nearly every night was a lightning storm. There are so many things to nit pick about the movie. Was it not worth watching? kind of. Would I recommend this?  Not really.,1474070400,,794,4.712230215827338

7010923,5,B00TJ57T4C,"This is probably the best modern fantasy film I've seen since The Lord of the Rings and the Hobbit. Sex, violence, and gore are not played up like they are in too many modern fantasy films,  especially Game of Thrones. The costumes and setting look clean and believable. Too many films today feel they have to show everything as being dirty and crude. Perhaps this is the way they would have looked, not like the clean settings of a 50's film. But I enjoy looking at something a lot better that does not show everybody wearing rags, and walking around in what looks like the aftermath of a disaster.
Aside from that its also a good, well acted story.",1472774400,7,650,4.46218487394958

7010929,2,B00TJ57T4C,It wasn't historically correct or even close to realistic. Lame B movie by someone who knows nothing about the Viking Age.,1472342400,,122,4.857142857142857

7010952,1,B00TJ57T4C,The only reason I watched this was because I thought if he was in it maybe it was better than the critics said. Ben died in the first twenty minutes. Probably his idea once he realized how bad it was. I'm sure he's embarrassed to this day.,1469318400,2,239,4.1063829787234045

The movie didn't have the high rollers of the screen BUT it is time others had a chance and the acting was pretty good, story was a little off the normal which was refreshing,  It was really cool how they did the wolves to make them look so big, and actually the snake did have enough dragon appearance to count, I would've liked a dragon like in Hobbit but this just shows some originality to me. No filthy talk, no sex, the right kind of battles, and some good bad guys. What more could you want? It is about time movies got back to being movies instead of sex shows, with filthy talk, I bet the movie makers could find more ratings if they would get back to entertaing..",1500422400,,766,4.175675675675675
