3848356,5,B0025KVNOU,"THIS IS A 'NIGHT COURT' HALLOWEEN EPISODE I JUST SAW FOR THE FIRST TIME HERE LOCALLY ON OUR 'FREE TV' CHANNEL, 'LaffTv' and I was impressed on how they dealt with the subject of real Witches. Even though it is full of discrimination and prejudice; it does show how it was once (not to very long ago) so hard to ""come out of the broom closet. I had to purchase this episode from Amazon; my Awesome partner in entertainment, wares, & miscellany.",1469491200,,443,4.414634146341464
3848357,5,B0025KVNOU,Great show,1468022400,,10,4.5
3848358,5,B0025KVNOU,"Here we go.  Finally, the cast has been completed with the addition of Markie Post as the Public Defender, Christine Sullivan.  Her inclusion to this wonderful cast made them go from fantastic to phenomenal.  There was something about Post's acting and character that properly rounded out the group.

Harry Anderson is still sitting court and presiding judge of Night Court.  As Harry Stone, Anderson injects both slapstick and magic (magician type) into the court.  Throw in the running joke about his love of his idol Mel Torme.  Episode 16 specifically deal with that along with Harry's charge, Leon.

Night Court is good fun, mostly clean comedy - what isn't is supplied by the delightfully lecherous Dan Fielding (John Larroquette).  Grab a friend or two, maybe even one of your kids - if you can pry them off their iWhatevers and initiate them into the wonderful wacky world of Night Court!",1467676800,,896,4.92

3848387,5,B0025KVNOU,Good Humor!!,1461369600,,12,5.5
3848388,4,B0025KVNOU,"When the show really hit its stride. Post became a regular and the raunch/tawdry humor went off the charts. No wonder this was the first year of Larroquette's many Emmys, with plenty of great storylines explored for the whole bunch. The show was always underrated (the Cosby lead-in during NBC's notorious Thursday night reign was a big diff) but deserved so much more credit for its unafraid approach, esp. during Season 3. Eps involving transsexuals, dwarf bosses, teenagers being shot, dementia and runaway children were not typically found on sitcoms back then, even during this non-PC period of the mid-80s. The writers were so skilled at weaving crass humor into true moments of profoundly genuine pathos, all under the mastered eye of late, great creator Weege. Which it why it was all the more disappointing that the following seasons went for more zaniness rather than taking time out for the heart, as well.",1460419200,,917,5.0

3848467,5,B0025KVNOU,"I'd forgotten how funny Night Court was and the first season was a little slow getting started.  But by season 2, they had found their niche, and season 3 builds on that.  I'm ready to move on to season 4.",1424304000,,205,4.1
3848468,5,B0025KVNOU,"Night Court season 3 saw two major cast changes the first being that Markie Post joins the cast as Christine Sullivan and Florence Halop joins as Flo a new bailef to replace Selma Diamond, who died shortly after season 2 ended. It would be easy to say that Flo is the same kind of character as  Selma was but she quickly comes into her own as a slightly more mean-spirited character. This season would also see some of the shows first real attempts at more dramatic work. The season starts out with Bull getting drunk  over Selma's death and not taking it very well, Harry quits his job because of a ruling he made that gets a kid shot and Flo is being forced to retire against her will, and then there is all star 2-part season finale that features a Hurricane, a group of pregnant women that goes into labor and the Night Court crew and a few guest stars find their hands full ending with  Harry talking to God. Sadly this would be Florence Halop's first and only season because she died shortly season 3 wrapped.",1423008000,,1015,4.388297872340425

3848477,5,B0025KVNOU,This show from the 1980s was one of the best written and performed of all the sitcoms of that error.  Noone delivers a bad line and punch lines are performed with perfection.  My husband laughs and laughs at all the antics in this show even though he saw everyone of them back in the '80s.  We are up to season 3 and will probably continue to watch all the seasons available.,1412294400,,375,4.253521126760563

3848530,4,B0025KVNOU,"In this 1985-86 Season, life in Judge Harry Stone's court starts with a tear (as the gang says farewell to Selma) and a horselaugh (as they welcome wiseacre Flo to the municipal menagerie). And it's all fun from there in 22 absurdly hilarious episodes as Harry and his staff, including Christine Sullivan(Markie Post)whom replaced Billie Young(Ellen Foley)whom was fired in the Spring of 1985 for having a too brotherly/sisterly relationship, contend with New York's zaniest nuts and dolts: the usual winos, weirdos, hookers and con artists, plus an orangutan, a rock star, a man from Saturn and a gorgeous witch who has Harry under her spell.

The 3-Disc Set of Season 3 ends on a dark and stormy night, when four expectant moms fulfill their expectations with the panic-stricken assistance of the whole Night Court crew. Lullaby and good Night Court!

This 1985-1986 Season also takes me back to memory lane to when I was 13 years old in the 7th grade and used to watch NIGHT COURT every Thursday night after THE COSBY SHOW and FAMILY TIES and when NBC's motto was ""Let's All Be There"".",1392854400,,1088,4.81283422459893

3848533,5,B0025KVNOU,"The sophomore outing of this 80's sitcom really began to gel. The perfect mix of characters created a hysterical ensemble show. The first 2 seasons are good, but from here on out, Night Court was out of the gate at full rate.

The writing has gone strange, as you have in sequence, episodes about a witch, sex change and Dan's midget boss (a character I'm rather fond of).  They just tried too hard to be edgy, and it didn't age well.  I'm probably alone in this, but I actually prefer Season 1 and 2.

Some of the scenes are deleted for commercial purposes when they air.  Waiting for the final 2 seasons to complete my collection.",1359417600,,455,4.65
3848594,5,B0025KVNOU,"Now that the seasons are actually coming out, I can easily recommend this show. Back when it was on tv it was part of the second golden age of television you had Cosby, Family Ties, Cheers (my all-time favorite)Night Court, and Hill Street Blues. Must See TV that really was MUST SEE. Great Writing great cast, great directors. This show was insane at times, but never really ""jumps the shark"" as the premise actually leaves things rather wide open. The show changed a bit between it's start and this season, but it's season 3 where it pretty much staked its claim as one of the best sitcoms on tv, and then just picked up steam from there. Whereas a lot of shows in the 80s always had that preachy moment/heartfelt moment at the end of the show, Night Court eventually put the ""heart"" into the show itself. Rather than seeming seperate it eventually just interwove itself into the fabric of the show, the result being you got a great comedy show full of clever writing and slapstick, but you never lost the reason behind why they did what they did. They cared. They were just no longer all in your face about it. That last minute preachiness is something that permeated the 80s but faded a bit later. I used to love Designing Women (yes I am a straight male but funny writing is funny writing) and sometimes that preachiness was hard to stomach. And it always came at the end lol. So usually I'd leave the room at that point so as not to ruin the funny moments. Night Court learned fast and changed that, without actually losing that ""heart"". At this point you have grown with the characters and are awarded for your faithfullness with fuller/richer jokes. a casual fan would still find an episode very funny but a devoted fan would find the humore even more rewarding (much like with Cheers). And since this show is being released now in full, I will say that you owe yourself to buy this series as it's fun to watch, it's great to watch how the characters evolve..and well did I mention it's insane? well it's insance in the best possible way lol. Much like Barney Miller (which it's often compared to, given that Night Court was created by someone who produced Barney Miller) it's full  of characters that may or may not exist in real life, but they are presented in such a way that it all seems to fit, and you get to see humanity at it's most mundane, most savage and most humany moments. By this time we have seen many characters come and go but it reemphasises the real world logistics of the show. How many of us have worked for a place (we'll say for nine years as that's how long the show lasted) and have gotten to know someone new only to see them leave shortly afterwards. part of it was intentional I'm sure and part was unintentional due to the unfortunate fact of a few actors passing away far too soon. But, by this time all the characters are in play that will carry the show to the end. And it's one of the finest ensemble casts that tv has ever offered. So definitely watch this series. And prepare to laugh your ass off. I won't use any internet shorthand as you will defintely be laughing out loud...so saying ""lol"" would only serve to lessen the effect of what will really happen:). This is simply a great show. A witty (sometimes ribald) adult comedy set in a new york court room...where the crazies that come in have stiff competition from those who work for the court. and in the end it all works out for everyone. Even if it doesn't who cares...You'll still be laughing through the tears....",1359244800,,3519,4.455813953488372

I dunno what they sourced to master these discs, but the video quality appears to be that of a poorly noise-controlled standard VHS. The image shutters and has a distortion bar at the top on many episodes, but not all. There has been no video processing or cleanup of any kind, which leaves me to think the originals they pulled this from were garbage anyways, or not the studio-broadcast versions.

I was excited when the prices fell, for a short while, and I was able to purchase these for her.

Wednesday nights are the only evenings our entire family is in one place, just after Christmas we started watching her DVD's and we finished all 3 seasons within a few weeks!!

As an adult I can see why my parents loved the show too. This particular season contains the episode where Selma died. It's one of the episodes I remembered most from my childhood, mostly because of how Bull reacted to her death. It was an episode that was both touching and humorous, that tackled the subject of the death of a cast member as well as the character she played in a manner that was easy to absorb. I don't normally like it when a comedy show steers into the realm of sorrow but Night Court handled it superbly, without losing pace. Looking back now I have to imagine the rest of the cast were coping with the very real death of the actress who had played the character they were mourning from the first and second seasons, so it had to have been difficult for them to roll out the punchlines but they all stayed true to form. This season also brings back the one-off character Christine as a permanent cast member.",1282176000,3,1097,4.203791469194313

If you are hauled in to appear before this court, you will find yourself in the company of hookers, petty thieves, squabblers, nudists, and other peculiar strangers.

When its your turn to appear, a bailiff will escort you to the courtroom.  It will be either a tall, head-shaved bailiff named Bull or a short, raspy-voiced bailiff named Flo.  As you are led into the courtroom, a motley collection of spectators turn to watch you enter.

As you approach the bench, Dan Fielding will join you on your right: he is the district attorney.  He is not on your side.  If you are a woman, stand as far from him as you can: while his job is prosecutor, his hobby is collecting sexual encounters.

On your right is a very sexy, dolled-up public defender named Miss Christine Sullivan.  She is on your side.  If you are a man with an overactive libido and an urge to pursue Miss Sullivan; forget-about-it: she is a goody-two-shoes.

The man standing next to the judge is sweater-clad Mac.  He will introduce you and read your charges.  His easy going manner and professionalism will put you at ease, unless his wife''s vietnamese family is in town; they drive him to distraction; you better hope he doesn't read the wrong charges!

Behind the bench sits the black-robed Judge Harry T. Stone.  You wonder, ""How could this quick-witted youngster possibly be a judge?""  If you tell his honor that you are an avid fan of Mel Torme, you may get off with only a $50 fine and time served.  Good luck!

Extras: none.

Season 1 & 2 should have been released together, which would have increased sales as no one wanted just Season 1 (not even me!)

3848648,5,B0025KVNOU,"Seasons one and two of Night Court were good, but season three begins some of the best years of the show with Markie Post joining the cast as Christine, the public defender and Florence Halop replacing Selma Diamond as one of the two bailiffs - Selma died during the summer of 1985. Christine filled what was really missing from the bill that former public defender Billy just never could deliver.  Christine is who we always knew was Harry's soulmate, a fact the two of them dance around for the entire duration of the series. Beautiful, compassionate, and somewhat naive, she also makes the perfect target for Dan Fielding's leachery. Harry's soulmate was something Billy just never convinced me she could be, and she simply wasn't the type to attract Dan Fielding.

This season also marks a full turn away from the ""Barney Miller"" style of the first two seasons as the show turns into full scale mayhem with a courtroom as just an incidental backdrop for the parade of human oddities that come before Judge Harry Stone. This is also the first year John Astin begins to make regular appearances as someone who was married to Harry's mom after she deserted him as a child. It turns out the two met in a mental institution, but - as Astin never fails to mention - ""He's feeling much better now"". Astin's character at first provides a link to Harry's missing years with his mother, but in a later season he is revealed to be much more than that.

Another change that has taken place is that Dan Fielding is now portrayed as someone who has no money, when in the first season he was always going on about his substantial portfolio. Dan's desperation for both s ex and money turns him into the ultimate greed machine, yet he still retains a likability that is comparable only to the likes of Jack Carson and Daffy Duck. No wonder John Larroquette won four Emmys for his portrayal before finally retiring his name from consideration.

Quan Le returns periodically as Mac's wife. Mac is the likable and efficient clerk of the court, and Quan Le is the girl that has loved Mac since she was a girl in Vietnam and he was a soldier there. Unfortunately, she is always having troubles confusing advertising with laws - trouble that usually costs Mac money. For example she believes that ""American Express - Don't Leave Home Without It"" is some kind of statute.

Most humor and movies from the 80's just haven't aged very well, but this show is different. It's timeless in the way that The Marx Brothers and the Three Stooges are, and I highly recommend it.",1257552000,56,2547,4.626106194690266

Still glad they are starting to roll them out.  Season 4 and on are my favorite with Roz Rozline joining the cast-she is great!

There is no firm release date, however.  The same website was spot on with the news about Season 2, so my faith in this terrific news, and for long suffering Night Court fans, is high.  Season 3 was a high water mark for this series, along with seasons 4 and 5.  Markie Post joined the cast full time, and some great storylines were in play.

Judge Harry reaches out to the characters and helps them with a lot of wisdom.  The later seasons will probably sell a lot better than early seasons because Markie Post, Charles Robinson and Marsha Warfield joined show later and became permanent.  The banter between Christine and Dan was priceless which we don't get to see until later.
So for what it's worth to the company that puts out the night court dvds please for the love of excellent programming release the rest of the seasons!",1250640000,7,644,4.573913043478261

8351099,5,B0025KVNOU,"I suppose there are a few people out there who have never heard of the comedy series, Night Court, which ran from 1984 to 1992. But for those unfortunate few, they truly do not know what they are missing.

Night Court broke the usual comic mold. Most comedies are centered around a normal central character witnessing the madness around him or her. With Night Court, everyone is nuts, including Harry Anderson, who plays a judge, a figure society assumes is as solid as a rock.

What made this show so darn funny was clever, well-written scripts, the right combination of identifiable personalities (I mean, who does not know a person like Dan Fielding or Christine Sullivan?), and the choice of actors perfectly suited to match their characters, giving performances of the roles of their careers.

There was also an incredible range in its humor. While most comedy series usually find one level of banality and stay there, the comedy in Night Court covered a greater spectrum. Thus, the humor was sometimes poignant, sometimes philosophical, sometimes slapstick, farcical, or even downright dumb, many times in the same episode. The humor, though, was never boring. The humor was intelligent, smart, ... and just darn funny.

The show never really jumped the shark, even when it easily could. In the eighth season a new character, a ditzy Court Reporter, was introduced. So now there are two comic relief characters in the Courtroom, the Court Reporter and one of the Bailiffs, Bull Shannon (Richard Moll.) While introducing a new character to an established routine is usually fatal to the over-all chemistry of the cast, this new character, through deft comic script-writing, fits right in, adding, not hindering, the comic effect.

Recurring actors include John Astin, of Addams Family fame, Yakov Smirnoff, and Mel Torme, who shows incredible acting flair as Harrys idol.

For all those who have not seen this series, check it out.",1498003200,,1936,5.034375
