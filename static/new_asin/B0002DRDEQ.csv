8026837,3,B0002DRDEQ,"The main thing about this DVD is that it is short. Head into the kitchen for some more chips and you'll miss half of it. What's on the DVD is good content. I don't see too many Broncos games living in the southeast, so it was good to see a lot of the big plays that I missed. I too, thought it was interesting that Clinton Portis got snubbed on this DVD. Even his spectacular 5 TD game against the Chiefs was mentioned only in passing.

Really, the only fault is the length. You would think that by putting it on DVD, they'd give you more material, not the other way around. I can't imagine paying full price for this DVD. I got it for $3 on ebay and I think that's about what it's worth.",1131494400,,688,4.0588235294117645
8026838,3,B0002DRDEQ,"I agree with the above review.  Considering how great of a year Portis had in 2003, and how many great runs he had, this DVD was disappointing in that regard.  The only reason that I can see for this DVD not showing more Portis highlights from 2003, is the fact that by the time the DVD came out, Portis wasn't on the Broncos anymore, and this DVD probably just wanted to focus more on the current Broncos.

Other than that, as a die-hard Denver Broncos fan, I pretty much enjoyed the DVD, except of course for the brief highlights of the playoff loss to the Colts.  At least those highlights, or I should say from my point of view, lowlights, were brief.  My other complaint is that while it showed a lot of highlights of some of our victories from the 2003 season, it only showed a few seconds of highlights from our second victory over the Raiders, the game that was in Oakland.  Being that I intensely dislike the Raiders, to put it mildly, I was disappointed about that.

Hopefully the 2005-06 Denver Broncos DVD will have the title Super Bowl XL Champions in it.",1116028800,,1068,4.418367346938775
8026839,3,B0002DRDEQ,"This DVD has some decent highlights, but only 22 minutes of content.  The focus is on the team's overall performance, but concentrates particularly on Plummer and his receivers.  Strangely, there is very little mention of Clinton Portis, and almost no highlights of his runs.  If you're looking for Portis highlights, like I was, look elsewhere.  It does include a couple of great runs by Griffin, Dante Hall's amazing kick return, and Randy Moss's over-the-head touchdown lateral.",1113091200,,481,5.2894736842105265
