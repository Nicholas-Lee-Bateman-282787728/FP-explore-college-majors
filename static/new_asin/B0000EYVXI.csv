8176677,4,B0000EYVXI,"I just watched this movie for the first time, and I didn't see the change in aspect ratio that the other reviewer mentioned. Am I alone here? Am I watching a different copy? As far as the movie goes, it's nothing amazing, quite cute and amusing, and the lead performers are quite fun to watch together. Juliette Binoche is her usual beautiful self, but if you're looking for a life-altering experience, probably elsewhere is better. Still, recommended as a good date movie, especially given what else is out there right now.",1094169600,,524,4.769230769230769
8176678,1,B0000EYVXI,"This is a warning that applies only to the Canadian dvd version of this film. I've recently purchased two movies distributed by TVA Films in Canada, ""Jet Lag"" and ""Me Without You"" on dvd. I was intensely disappointed to see that neither film was presented in its original widescreen format. Both dvds start at the proper theatrical aspect ratio of 2.35:1 during the opening credits but inexplicably switches to 1.75:1 during the rest of the film. All of the bloopers in the bonus section are in the proper aspect ratio. Why does this company do this? People who don't like the black borders aren't going to be pleased and the cineaste such as myself hate pan and scan, so who is this dvd supposed to please? My only option from now on is to completely avoid TVA distributed dvds.",1084147200,,779,4.611510791366906
