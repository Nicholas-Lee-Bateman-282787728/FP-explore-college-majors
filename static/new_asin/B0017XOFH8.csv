Unfortunately they yanked it and I miss it. It was truly cutting comedy. So if
Amazon is able to find and restock this series I would purchase the entire
Series. I hope you , good luck.

8267723,5,B0017XOFH8,"I love this DVD. It is really good quality and exactly what I expected. I ordered it for a friend and he laughs and laughs at it every time he watches it. The price was a great deal. Will certainly buy more down the road. I was very pleased with the process from order to shipping, I received it when they said I would and the package was just right, perfectly intact. I am one very happy customer.",1347926400,2,398,4.115384615384615
