8185917,5,B000OP3ZOO,"This is definitely as good as it gets in terms of learning the fundamentals and mechanics to this great game that we call basketball. Rick Torbett has definitely put together some of today's finest players in terms of demonstrating different facets of the game from ballhandling, scoring the ball, post play, passing to defense. Without the fundamentals and mechanics to these different parts of the game, you can never and will ever become a true affective basketball player at any level on the court. I've been playing the game for quite a while myself and I managed to cop this set. I highly recommend this dvd for beginners as well as veteran players of the game. Because at times we can manage to get away from the little things on the court. I'd give it 10 stars if I could.",1231545600,3,780,4.578571428571428
8185918,5,B000OP3ZOO,"My ten-year-old son is really serious about basketball.  So I bought this set of training DVDs to help him take his game to a higher level.  We've now watched several, and they are fantastic.  Coach Torbett does so much more than just provide a list of drills - he provides context.  Players walk away understanding what they need to do and why.  Even my younger son (age eight) is watching and learning.

Fantastic set - get them all!",1198540800,4,435,4.512820512820513
