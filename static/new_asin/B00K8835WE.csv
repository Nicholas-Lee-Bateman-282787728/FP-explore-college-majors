6407006,3,B00K8835WE,Cute romantic story. Drinking part was not so cute. It's hard to be married to an alcoholic. I would rather be married to a successful plastic surgeon than an alcoholic writer. :(,1524182400,,179,4.625

6407020,3,B00K8835WE,"in the end, two alcoholic writers got engaged to be married via proposal by woman in a wedding dress. Both lacked self confidence to pursue their dreams because their psychy was out of wack, and they allowed others in their life to compound their own personal and career life difficulties. Not too mention, but to top it off, both were dating the wrong people, wrong career path, and wrong living environments (when single from each other)",1504915200,,439,4.7894736842105265

are the scenes of the northern California coast :
the sea stacks just offshore, the surf coming in to the beach,

6407029,1,B00K8835WE,"Ugh, this was so annoyingly bad. I was looking for something cute and fluffy so I wasn't searching for an oscar winner when I picked this. But according to this being absent minded and clumsy are qualities that shouldn't be annoying but induce deep love and being a guy who lives in a alone in a lighthouse next door to his mother with just radios for company doesn't give off a serial killer vibe but just means ""something deeper is going on"". But I could actually put that aside if it wasn't combined with a horrible script and lead characters were both cheating on their partners and acting like they were some kind of victims when in fact they were both pretty horrible. Oh and the monstrously manipulative mother who was happily dancing away at the end. What?!?  Anyway this viewer is not in love.",1489622400,4,802,4.531034482758621

6407031,5,B00K8835WE,"I adored this movie - the concept of breaking off from expectations and finding yourself and then being able to find someone special.  I wanted to live in a lighthouse after this, until I rememberred the storms, the stone sweating and cold, blah blah.  Such a wonderful emotional trip.  It did take me a bit to get its rhythm but
once I got past that distraction I was in for the whole thing.  It actually helped me open a new chapter in my own life.  Not glitzy - no, but meaningful.  LOVED the club music and songs as well.  Fun to see some men with actual rhythm.  Open window into other cultures.  Seriously on my fav list.",1488672000,2,627,4.2905982905982905

6407043,1,B00K8835WE,"This movie was a real stinker and here is why. I love romantic comedys especially ones that have great character development and an really good plot but I was totally put off by the horrific script terrible acting and ridiculous lead characters.
In the first act you get introduced to the movie heroine and her fiancee who have absolutely zero chemistry. While the main character is very beautiful and flirts with everyone to get her way nothing about her character feels sincere. (It as if this script was wrote for Kim K) She goes through life with her head in the clouds and absent minded at times even though she graduated from Oxford with a degree in law yet her true passion is writing so even though she went to Oxford her only option to breaking into that career is to live with her parents and work at her moms Cosmo wannabe magazine. What angers me the most about this character is that she so weak mentaly and we are never told a good enough reason why. I would have like to see something traumatic unfold from her past so we could see why she is the way she is today. Then further into the movie she meets a new love intrest and again these characters have zero chemistry and through a ridiculous scenario they some how the manage to get together. So angry that such good cinematography went to waste.",1483488000,3,1313,4.452282157676349

6407069,4,B00K8835WE,"It was ok.  The storyline had potential, but the writers tied it up too neatly. And, some of the acting was bad.  Ok for a bit of romance with a happy ending. This is not my usual
action type movie I love, but I need to watch some feel good movies to raise my dopamine levels and not my adrenaline.  Still would recommend it if you like happy romantic endings. I gave it 4 stars for the nice Persian music. And the moral of the story.  Marry someone you truly love that truly loves you.  Arranged marriages and convenience marriages, or marrying for status and money are usually very unhappy.",1477612800,,592,4.345454545454546

6407072,3,B00K8835WE,typical love story of two people from completely different backrounds who find out they aren't as different as they think .. it was nice how they had it end up which in real life probably wouldn't have .. it's pretty much a no no for women from those types of backrounds to marry or fall in love outside their own cultures.. maybe someday it won't be .. but as of now its ok if a man from that culture marries outside his culture but not for a woman ..,1476748800,,452,4.089887640449438

6407106,1,B00K8835WE,This was a terrible movie with wooden acting and bad dialogue. I like Riley Smith so I watched it til the end; however I'm now wishing I could get 2 hours of my life back. The soundtrack made my ears bleed. [SPOILER] I also couldn't get over the fact that she had a nice fiance (even if he was a bit dorky) who seemed to really care for her and she cheated on him and later left him at the altar. Falling in love with someone else happens but she should have at least had the decency to break up with her fiance before sleeping the other guy or running off without explanation on her wedding day. Made it impossible for me to root for her. Plus NO ONE in this movie had any idea what a hippie is. Do yourself a favor and watch a chick flick where the script isn't written by a 5 year old and the heroine doesn't act like a total selfish jerk in her pursuit of happiness.,1473379200,,870,4.034682080924855

She was the epicenter of the film and the actor didn't do that justice. I'd like to say there was chemistry but it came too late in the film. The story and ""love"" didn't build. Shirin couldn't portray a solid emotion even when she was forgetful or ditzy. She was undecided about all her emotions. It wasn't believable.",1472860800,,463,4.590361445783133

It was a pretty film and passed the time as I worked on a project as long as I overlooked huge plot problems. The best actors were the fiance, one of his best friends, the blond and the mother. The script should have been about the fiance blowing off his engagement to go after the blond friend and what the Iranian mom's reaction would be.

Endangering other people just to establish she was absent-minded and create an implausible scenario at the end so she could be arrested was not acceptable.  Cars kill. The eyebrows on the mother were completely distracting and made her look like she was an alien, creating the effect of a science-fiction movie . I kept waiting for the flying saucers to land. The directing was not particularly good either. The  heroine with her arm on the back of the couch leaning in for the kiss made her look more like a hero than the heroine. He had to take her clothes off because she would catch pneumonia. She knew she couldn't handle her liquor so she got drunk so she could sleep with him. All in all it just seemed like they made a lot of excuses to make a lot of bad choices. I'm with others here who do not think this relationship would last. I wasn't particularly fond of Shirin.

Four people out of the entire cast could act; Boniadi, Smith, Medigan and the man who played the roll of the police officer. Sadly however, they were not directed well. The plot and the sense were cheesy and unconvincing. Poor sound and conversation recording. Terrible acting by the Iranian actors, except for Ms. Boniadi, of course.

Maz Jobrani is such a hilarious comedian his character did not deserve to be treated the way this girl treated him. She cheats on him, gets mad at him for coming after her, runs away from him, sees her lover again, then stands him up at the wedding. In my opinion, she's the villain of this story. The romance of Shirin and the author's son would have lasted a year tops anyway. Both characters so easily cheat on their long term significant others, they can just as easily leave each other.

6407337,4,B00K8835WE,"Liked it - predictable young love story. Thought the husband-to-be looked too old for Shirin; she was far too young for him. Hated that within the first 5 minutes she presents herself as a gorgeous, intelligent clutz and ditz which did not seem to carry through the end of the movie. Found myself wondering if it was all an act just to get away from an overbearing mother and the demands of an arranged marriage but that question was never resolved in my mind. I love Amy Madigan and liked her character in this but felt it could have been introduced sooner and more time spent in her environment. Frankly, I wanted to drop-kick Shirin's mother to another galaxy from the get-go and it seemed no shot of the movie did not have her whiny voice or annoying mannerisms in-your-face. When Shirin finally tells her to 'shut up' I almost cheered out loud. Could have used more of Shirin's dad who played his character so very well and a lot less of her mother. It is a nice story, the scenery is amazing, could have used more lighthouse, island and ocean and less big city. All in all, it was a nice movie for a rainy, boring day. I would watch it again - once but not more that and I'd FF the parts with the mother. Ugh.",1449878400,,1215,4.333333333333333

The stereotyping was just awful, if it was supposed to make the film grab a little cultural color, it's a huge fail.  I particularly disliked the mother, with her collagen lips and what-the-hell eyebrows(?).  Gave the woman's face the look of two caves perched over her plastic face. Gross.

6407555,4,B00K8835WE,"Super cute movie!!  Highly recommend it!  Loved the story line, it was original and it took unexpected turns.  Loved Anita Khalatbari as the antagonist in the story.  She was superb as the meddling, controlling, materialistic mother.

I enjoyed the contrast between the two main characters Shirin and William, and the transformation of Shirin as she becomes more true to her real self (even though her real self is not what would please her materialistic mom).  To grow as a person Shirin must continually take risks as she steps away from her comfortable ready made life to become who she is really meant to be.  William helps her in this process because he is already where Shirin wants to be, but William need help himself.  Shirin is the help that William needs to break out of the walls he built around himself.

I also enjoyed the mixing of cultures.  The middle eastern culture made the film that much more enjoyable.

Super cute movie, I was surprised by the unexpected turns in the plot.  However, I didn't give it five stars because the connection between the two main characters could have been developed more with dialog between them.  We get to see them hang out and spend time together in very lovely romantic settings, but many times they don't let you in on the dialog between Shirin and William, if there was any.  In that way the relationship between Shirin and William seemed to lack depth.

In spite of that one negative, I think the movie really delivers as an original romantic comedy.  I was glad I watched it, well worth the time!",1422403200,,1554,4.678966789667896

Some of the other characters are kind of cheesy. Her mother is very unlikable.

If you like falling in love with someone that is real and have it set around a lighthouse/ small town then you may love this.

It is not for everyone.

Movies are  my escape, I like to sit back, relax, and take a trip with the cast and crew, I and they had to work way to hard to make this trip enjoyable. Did get to see comic Maz Jobruni, had only heard his voice on radio.",1414972800,2,550,4.083333333333333

Shirin is engaged to marry Mike.  It is essentially an arranged marriage.  She works for her mother, an overbearing woman, who wants to run her life.  Shirin edits books in her mother's publishing firm, and is especially desirous of getting an interview with Rachel Harson an acclaimed author.  She sets out by car across country.  Her car breaks down along the way in a remote area, and she knocks on the door of a house.  A woman answers and welcomes her in and insists that she stay the night.  Shirin notices that there are numerous copies of Rachel Harson novels in the house.  She then looks at the back cover and realizes that the photo matches the woman of the house.  Shirin meets Rachel's son Will  the following morning whom she doesn't recognize.  He had taken her to his apartment after one of her mother's extravagant parties in which she had gotten drunk.  A strong relationship develops between Rachel and Shirin.  A romantic relationship develops between Shirin and Will.

Shirin's mother does not want Shirin to get involved with Will.  Will comes to the publishing house and Shirin's mother tells him that Shirin has eloped with Mike, which is a lie.  Will is devastated.  He is also overwhelmed because his mother has taken very ill.  There is also a secret that Will harbors which he reveals to Shirin about the books written by Rachel.

Nazanin Boniadi is outstanding as Shirin and is very beautiful.  Riley Smith is also outstanding as Will.  Amy  Madigan is excellent as Rachel.  Gerry Wallace plays a pivotal role as Officer Henderson.",1532563200,,1668,4.771929824561403
