8044616,4,B00074DY6Q,"The story is about the devastating effects of a giant hailstorm on the small town of Rutland, Vermont. Christy Blanchard (Linda Purl) is a doctor at a local hospital, the general manager of which is more concerned with bottom-line profitability rather than patient care. The Blanchards are waiting for a donor liver to be transplanted into their son Jason (Myles Jeffrey) who was injured in a climbing accident. Jason's dad Dan (Ted McGinley), a Forestry Service supervisor, is out on patrol when he sees, first, his rock-climbing daughter Marie in difficulties on a climb so he goes to help. Then he hears that the plane carrying the donor liver for his son has crashed in the hailstorm and Dan goes to the rescue. Jason, seemingly safe enough, goes to entertain customers at a car auction run by Pete Crane (Stacy Keach) but the hailstorm wrecks the auction and the building where it is held. Fires break out when the hail brings down power-lines. Similar freak hailstorms provoked by global climate change have been known over the past decades so the story-line is quite believable, the acting passable and the direction (by Neil Kinsella) quite effective dramatically.",1364515200,,1172,4.98469387755102
8044617,3,B00074DY6Q,OK - not great.  It is not one that I will watch over and over - which is how I rate them.  The story line is too over the top but it does have some great action scenes.,1277683200,,169,3.4210526315789473
8044618,5,B00074DY6Q,"A very good movie,highly recommend. if you enjoyed Day after to Tomorrow you'll get a kick out of this,especially those giant snowballs falling without warning.",1268870400,2,160,5.44
8044619,5,B00074DY6Q,This movie is so cool! It will keep you on the edge of your seat!,1206835200,,65,3.4
8044620,3,B00074DY6Q,"It has been a LONG TIME since I've laughed so hard at a movie.
I know, I know.  It's not a comedy.  Still, it was SOOO funny.
They tried to make a 'serious (yet wholesome) suspense movie' and their effort was pretty good.  It looked good enough, but there was so much that simply fell flat.  I'll list a few (but only a few :)
-The devastating hailstorm ravages an area for a few minutes, but afterwards, there is no hail on the ground (there also should have been a number of corpses, but...)
-The Dad said ""Get inside the house!""  And then we said ""What house?!?!  In the last shot we watched it turn into a burning pile of rubble.  What house is she supposed to get into?!?!"" (Crazy how that hail would set all these building on fire...)
-A girl is being suspended by a rope, and is feriecy pelted by hailstones.  The onlookers keep yelling ""Stay still!!  Stay still!!"" and we yell ""What is she hanging there!  What is she suppsed to do!?!?""
I would still recommend people to get it.  (I'm going to buy it myself.)  Just don't expect some real great movie.  Unless you want a laugh... :)",1120348800,17,1090,4.310344827586207
