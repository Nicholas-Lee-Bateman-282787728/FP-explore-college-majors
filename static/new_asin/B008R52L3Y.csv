5178793,3,B008R52L3Y,"This set containing six of Dimension's Children of the Corn entries (CotC is owned by Anchor Bay and 2 was held but never released on DVD by Paramount.  CotC: Genesis is not included here.) and three of Halloween sequels (1, 4, and 5 are owned by Anchor Bay and 2 and 3 are owned by Universial.) is a good set for those of you wanting a majority of sequels and who want to save space on your shelves.  All 9 films come on three discs; two are flippers while CotC 5,6, and 7 are on one single sided, dual layer disc.  (Why Echo Bridge chose to not to do this with CotC 2,3,and 4 and the three Halloweens is anyone's guess.) and come in one case that holds all three discs on a single hub.  The aspect ratios for the CotC titles are correct (2 is Full Screen and 3-7 run a gannet of 1:85 to 1:77 which I believe to be true.  2 was a direct to video sequel before the advent of widescreen televisions so the 4:3 aspect is probably correct.). It's with the Halloween titles where we run into problems. The Curse of Michael Meyers is correct with it vein 1:85.  Resurrection is correct with 2:35 but the master used here looks messy and scratchy where it's original DVD was much smoother and cleaner.  H20 is where Echo Bridge ran afoul by taking the 2:35 ratio and blowing it up to 1:77.  While the picture is the most beautiful looking out of the entire set, the screen does this weird pan and scan motion I haven't seen since I completely stopped watching Full Screen versions of movies.  Also no bonus material are included which is a real bummer to fans of H20 and H:Ressurection since both original DVDs were rich in extra features. CotC discs had none unless you count previews of Dracula 2000 and Mimic and it's sequels as bonus features.  If you can look past the flaws with ratios and prints, this set is fine but make sure you get it cheap.  Amazon is listing it at $15 when Walmart has it for $8.  I bought this for the CotC titles so I'm happy with my purchase.  For anyone thinking of saving space by getting rid of you stand alone Halloween discs, I'd hold off on that until a more respectable company like Lionsgate or Shout! Factory gets a hold of the rights to Dimension's vault titles and does these movies some real justice.  Echo Bridge and Mill Creek may offer cheap prices on their movies but this low price comes at a cost usually by screwing with aspect ratios or using less than perfect quality masters.  Why Dimension sold the rights to these companies is another mystery waiting to be solved.",1351209600,6,2515,4.355460385438972

8529886,3,B008R52L3Y,"The set was not really good. If you are a horror enthusiast, like me, and are just getting it to make the collection, go right on ahead, but it is not that good. The DVD's are double sided, the picture quality is crap, and ...well you cant really say more.

I only bought this for having the collection; that's really all this is good for.",1409529600,2,339,4.2153846153846155

8529890,3,B008R52L3Y,"This DVD value pack is priced right to own 6 Children of the Corn films with 3 Halloween films. Children of the Corn 2-7 and Halloween 6,7,8 are included. Some of the films are wide-screen and others are full-screen (many of the CotC sequels were released direct to video). Children of the Corn was based on a short story by Stephen King. Halloween is a legendary slasher film directed by John Carpenter. Both films managed to birth horror franchises with many sequels (neither of the original films are included in this set). Children of the Corn is light horror fare and Halloween is legendary for Mike Myers. Admittedly these Halloween sequels are probably the worst of that franchise but you can't beat the price.
