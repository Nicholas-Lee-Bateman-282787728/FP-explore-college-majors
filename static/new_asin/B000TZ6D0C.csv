8211507,4,B000TZ6D0C,"I got this dvd so I could review what I already knew about stone massage, and it was sufficient for that.  On several occations the camera angles were poor and you could not see the therapists hands at all, so minus a star for the production/editing (very basic production quality, like editing was done at a local college). Other than that it served its purpose as a refresher for me. It does not talk much about healing touch, other than general reminders about client comfort, pressure, and stuff covered in the 18 page ""user manual"".

The video covers basics such as the spinal layout, and massage strokes (efflurage, petressage) with the stones performed in real time to give you a feel of how to pace yourself.  It also reminded me that stone massage is very different from basic swedish in that there is no way not to break continuity, you have to stop and pick up/lay down stones, and that is okay: the nature of stone massage.",1228694400,14,935,4.586826347305389
