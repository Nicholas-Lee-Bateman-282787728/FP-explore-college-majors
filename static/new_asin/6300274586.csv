The movie was actually shot on location at The Spanish Riding School in Vienna and has tons of long performances by the stallions under saddle. The time period is of Hilter Germany when Col. Podhajsky (if you don't know who he his you haven't been exposed to enough dressage history) was fighting to keep the school alive.

With a cast of stars from old Hollywood and upcoming stars from the sixties, it was produced with foresight.  Animal lovers will respect the risks that were taken by the group who pulled off this great project of love for the sake of a breed of horse and a tradition they thought was worth any possible danger.

298263,4,6300274586,"I don't know how historically accurate this film is but I found the story fascinating nonetheless.  Even though it takes place during the war, there is no sense of impending doom or desperation.  There are but a few explosions, some scattered fires, and one battle sequence that concludes rapidly, only a hint that a war was taking place at that time.  Instead, they just talked about the occupation of surrounding countries and worried about their Lipizzaner stallions and mares.  It was a bit impersonal, not helped by a strangely lackluster performance by Robert Taylor (yes, he did look silly in that hat).  At least Curt Jurgens and Lilli Palmer took up the slack, giving the best performances of the lot.  Loved all the locations, a good supporting cast, and those fantastic horses performing a routine worthy of Busby Berkeley.  Thoroughly enjoyable.",1394323200,,857,5.035460992907802

It is also the only place where the historic leaps (""Airs Above The Ground) once used on the battlefield are still performed in their purity.
The man (one of the greatest horsemen ever) Alois  Podjhasky who was director of the School for 30 years was also involved in the production. Robert Taylor, the actor who plays him in the film, was terrified of the stallions. They put him on one of the experienced older school horses. Unfortunately, the stallion neighed. Taylor leaped off in terror.  And they finally sent for one of the stallions who had, long before, been retired from the school. So, when you see the scenes of the Lipizanners actually in  performance it it is the great Podjhasky that is riding, not Mr. Taylor!

298979,5,6300274586,"BEHIND THE SCENES & TRIVIA: This Disney Studios production was first released to theatres on March 29, 1963. It later aired on Walt Disney's `Wonderful World of Color' on NBC television as a two part episode on October 17 and 24, 1965. It re-aired on November 11 and 18, 1973. For the television airing it was re-edited  and renamed ""Flight of the White Stallions"". The screenplay was the first Disney project for 29 year old A.J. Carothers, base on the book ""The Dancing White Horses of Vienna"", by Colonel Alais Podhajsky. In fact, Mr. Disney sent Carothers on travel to Vienna to meet the Colonel and visit the school for research.  Walt believed in having a good story as the base of a film, so much so that some writers were allowed to produce or direct their screenplays. The first director hired for this film wanted to bring in a writer to change the script that Walt Disney had already approved.  As a result a new director was hired, Arthur Hiller. The writer Carothers stayed on several years with Disney to write other screenplays including ""Emil and the Detectives"", ""The Happiest Millionaire"", and ""Never a Dull Moment"". The first writer, from England, had been removed from the project when his draft included a characterization of American G.I.'s as  ""gum-chewing soldiers"" according to Harry Tytle's biography.  Walt and his wife had also traveled to Vienna and had a luncheon at the Spanish Riding School while being treated to a performance of the horses.
The solid background musical score is by long-time Disney studio composer Paul Smith, who won an Academy Award  for his work on Pinocchio. Smith worked for the studio from 1934 to 1962, writing the music for most of the Disney True-Life Adventures and many of their short cartoons. He was nominated for his compositions for Cinderella, Song of the South, Snow White and the Seven Dwarves, Saludos Amigos, and The Three Caballeros. The famous composing duo, the Sherman Brothers, were asked by Walt Disney to create a German style song for the production, and so ""Just Say `Auf Widersehen' "" was born.  The film is 117 minutes in length in the theatrical edit version. Released on VHS in 1987, and DVD in 2004.

STORY: During World War II, the Colonel Podhajsky (Robert Taylor) and his famous Spanish Riding School featuring white Lipizzaner horses in Vienna are threatened as the Nazis are moving in. The Colonel smuggles the stallions into St. Martin. The mares of the breed are in Czechoslovakia, and the Colonel fears their fate with the swiftly approaching Russians.  The Colonel hatches a bold plan to appeal to U.S.  General Patton, who is known a s horseman, to help rescue the horse and protect the future breeding. Great supporting cast including Eddie Albert.",1220486400,9,2744,4.869098712446352

If you are looking for Tommy Sands and Annette in this one, forget it cause it has an adult cast starring the Legendary Robert Taylor and the beautiful international star Lilli Palmer, who once was Mrs. Rex Harrison, and Eddie Albert and German star Curt Jurgens.. Although there are nazis and one battle scene at the end, this is not a bloody war film but it does have a fairly adult theme but there are plenty of beautiful horses.. And for sure some scenes in the Spanish Riding school in Vienna with these famous horses doing their dressage routine..

299117,5,6300274586,"The Spanish Riding School of Vienna has been around for hundreds of years, but was nearly lost in WW2 when the Lipizzaner breeding herd was separated from the stud farm of Piber and moved into Czechoslovakia, and then faced with possible destruction at the hands of the Russians.

Alois Podhajsky, the Director of the school, made a bold request of the Americans, especially General Patton who himself had ridden in the 1912 Olympics, to save the horses.  Patton appreciated the tradition of the Spanish Riding School and was able to effect the rescue of the breeding mares along with allied prisoners of war, effectively saving the Lipizzaners and the tradition of the School.

This Disney movie was made in 1963 and has some of the typical Disney characteristics of the time such as blunting the visual depiction of violence and war, but beyond the technical shortcomings, the movie accurately captures the desperate situation facing those who would save a longstanding tradition bound in living beings -- both the horses and the riders -- and how many individuals through both minor and grand gestures worked toward a common cause and saved an institution.

The movie was filmed largely on location, and to watch it is to see a real piece of living history.  I highly recommend it.",1122681600,135,1284,4.925925925925926
299118,5,6300274586,"This is a wonderful movie, one that I can remember being shown - and begging for - when I was a small child.

Some Interesting 'Backstage' Information: The main character, Colonel Alois Podhajsky, is a bronze medal winner and famous dressage performer/trainer around the world. He was famous even before his debut with the Lippizzans. In his book, My Horses, My Teachers (highly reccomended for someone who knows something of horses), he recalls his experiences filming the movie. Obviously, Taylor wasn't the horseman that Podhajsky was, so the Colonel actually rode his parts. The horse he needed to ride (the horse he rode in history, Neapolitano Africa, was deceased) was a young stallion, who only recently had taken the place of Maestoso Alea in leading the quadrille and doing the solo during performances. (I can't remember the stallions name, and I don't have my book handy...sorry) He had a 'bad' habit of ""singing"" whenever another stallion entered the arena, and Podhajsky was unable to break him of it without implementing methods he saw as too harsh for such an intelligent horse. So, the stallion performed, ""singing"" along with the motions of his body. When Taylor mounted him, the horse started neighing. Podhajsky tried to convince him that the horse was only talking and that he would soon quiet, but was unable to settle the rider. The great scene, in performing for General Patton, was ridden by not only two riders (Podhajsky performing and Taylor doing the walking parts) but two HORSES, the young stallion who still had a black mane, and a old longe horse that they had dug up for Taylor. Kinda interesting! Anyway, this guy is a master!!! I just wish that Neapolitano Africa had been alive to perform the part himself.

In another scene, when the horses are being led from the Riding Hall to the bunker during an air raid, there were firecrackers bursting and all sorts of things near the horses to make the scene appear real. Of course, they also frightened the stallions and they reared and tugged and performed just like they should have, as a result of their fear. Podhajsky says that the ""American producers"" enjoyed running many takes, and doing lots of rehearsals. As a result of this, the stallions learned after the second shoot that there was nothing to be afraid of, and walked into the next acting pacified and calm.

Anyway, for more ""behind-the-scene stuff, the book My Horses, My Teachers offers something, and I'm sure the book the movie was based on will give more information, as well.

299119,5,6300274586,"""Miracle of the White Stallions"" has been a family favorite of ours for many years, so much so that when I moved to Idaho to attend graduate school, I had to swipe our old VHS copy from my parents just so I could have the movie with me.  We have been trying to find the movie for sale for a long time and are thrilled that it is finally being released on DVD.  Now, we all have a copy so we don't have to fight over it anymore!

  Why do we love this movie so much that we would fight over it?  Horses, horses, horses!  Not only are the dressage sequences spectacular to watch, but the story behind their near loss and preservation is wonderful.  In a time that is celebrated for destruction, there were a brave few that were willing to put their lives on the line for what many would call ""a few dumb animals"".  (Not me, of course!)  In my profession, I deal with extinction a great deal.  If it hadn't been for those people portrayed in the movie (which was based on a true story), I may have had one more extinction to add to my list.",1107475200,12,1037,4.109452736318408

Colonel Alios Podhajsky (Robert Taylor), the head of the school, does some fancy thinking and persuades a German general (Curt Jurgens) to define the horses as bona fide ""art treasures"" which would allow the animals to be moved out of harm's way. (The real Colonel choreographed all the graceful, spellbinding airs-above-the-ground performance scenes seen in the film.) Based upon the memoir The Dancing White Horses of Vienna by Colonel Alios Podhajsky.

299121,3,6300274586,"Several of the reviews on this site ask the Disney studio to release this film on DVD.  Well, they have and this review refers to the DVD version.
I have been familiar with this movie since I worked at the Disney studio in 16mm film distribution in the 1970s (about 7 years before the VHS blockbuster years began), and am familiar with the original negatives.  In what I am finding to be typical of the Disney folks, this film is presented in a 'full frame' version, rather than a WIDESCREEN version.  The film was shot for a 1:85x1 projected ratio (known as Academy Flat) which presents the picture in a slight retangular format.  However, a full frame, 4x3 video transfer of such a negative isn't all that bad, although it would have distinguised it from the normal VHS format.
Also, I am very surprised that the Disney people didn't make an effort to 'clean up' the original negative, which contains a great amount of negative dirt and scratches.  The DVD does preserve the original look to the film (color and tint), but there has been so much technology invented to digitally reproduce an almost flawless image, that I am surprised it isn't been used.  It is one of trhe major reasons that people have switched to DVD.
Also, look for a mistake in the original negative.  Just after the horses board the train, there are reddish, flash frames (possibly an overexposure to the camera original negative) which could easily have been removed digitally.
A few ""extras"" would have been nice, such as behind-the-scenes material.  This stinginess is becomming something notorious with recent Disney DVD releases.  Walt Disney shot tons of background footage for every movie he made, and this is stored in the studio vaults.  I've seen it in 16mm, although it was shot on 35mm..  You can ignore the lack of a WIDESCREEN image if the DVD contained these precious extras.  Otherwise, it's just a transfer of the old VHS image.  What's the point of that?
As far as Robert Taylor's performance, far from being 'wooden' (as one reviewer wrote) I agree with another reviewer who said that he was protraying a real man (who was also alive at the time and a hero in Europe), and the script and direction decided to present a truthful, realistic portrrait of him.  Don't forget that this movie, and many others (BALLERINA, HORSE WITHOUT A HEAD, ALMOST ANGELS) were shot in Europe after World War II.  They were made chiefly for a European theatrical audience and were intened for an American TV audience on THE WONDERFUL WORLD OF DISNEY.  So, you'll find a different style of acting and presentation: a bit slow for us, but perfect for their intended audience.",1078617600,249,2647,4.746724890829694
