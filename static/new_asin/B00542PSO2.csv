I drove 50 miles from home to see it, and was not dissappointed in any way.  It is not just for horse people, though they may appreciate it more.  Buck told us not just how to treat our horses, but each other in a moving and often very funny way.  I was impressed with his sense of humor after his cruel childhood.  The movie was beautiful, graffic, poetic, and made me laugh and cry.  I need to go ride my horse now!",1314489600,18,537,4.009433962264151
