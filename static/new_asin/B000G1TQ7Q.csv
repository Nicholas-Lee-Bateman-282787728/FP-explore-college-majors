8128615,5,B000G1TQ7Q,"This is a generous offering. The techniques are offered quickly by a pleasant practitioner who only speaks in terms of body work, no extra talk. Sit by with the remote ready to pause and rewind to make sure the information has been received otherwise your mind could become awash in too much information too fast. The model on the table is freakishly flexible and not a representative of an average human body. I would have preferred an average body to see how the techniques would be applied honestly. I purchased this dvd looking for some new ideas for my treatment table and got it.",1204848000,,585,4.634615384615385
8128616,1,B000G1TQ7Q,"it is done very low quality,shows lots of streaches but it is not very well organized, i wish it was separated by chapters etc",1196294400,,126,4.291666666666667
8128617,5,B000G1TQ7Q,"I loved it!!!  There was so much on this DVD!  Massage Nerd does it again!!  I massage a lot of athletes and this video gave me some stretches I hadn't even thought of and some that I had forgotten.  Thanks Massage Nerd!  Great techniques, well done!",1192579200,,250,4.3478260869565215
8128618,5,B000G1TQ7Q,"This is a very good streching tape for only 25 dollars. It has just about all the streching technics MT should know about. If anyone complaint about picture quality and all, I'll say again it's only $25 and you'll get lot more information,worth the money.",1189555200,,255,4.688888888888889
8128619,3,B000G1TQ7Q,The techniques are good. The videography is one dimensional. Cannot see all the techniques. No distinct muscles are addressed in the menu of this dvd so... I have a cllent coming in with specific needs. In order for me to find the stretches specific to this clients needs one must watch the entire video! This is not a user friendly dvd. Also the therapist does not verbalize what muscles he is  addressing. over all its okay.,1174694400,4,426,4.605263157894737
8128620,5,B000G1TQ7Q,"I loved the stretching techniques! There are many stretching techniques I have not seen before and I have incorporated them into my sports massage routine. I haven't mastered all of them, but it's a work in progress. Most of the stretching techniques explain what muscles are being stretched, but not all of them (most of them are self-explanatory). I would recommend this video to anybody who is interested in learning how to stretch a client!!!",1173657600,2,446,4.96
8128621,2,B000G1TQ7Q,"If you can get past the church basement it's filmed in, the single camera angle, the loss of focus, echoing audio and the therapist blocking a few of the stretches this is the DVD for you!

[next stretch, next technique, next stretch....I may hear that im my sleep tonight.]

I have to admit I did burst out laughing a few times watching this DVD. I was trying to imagine doing some of the techniques on my clients! For the majority of the stretches, your clients will have to be clothed in some manner. Draping would not be practical. You will also have to treat your clients quite regularly before trying a lot of these stretches. This isn't stuff you try on someone the first time they come to see you.

It would have been more beneficial to have the therapist explain the muscles being stretched and how he was moving the client. For expample: ""I'm going to laterally rotate the foot to stretch the tib...""  Rather than, ""Next stretch, move the foot this way to stretch the leg.""

Physical therapists could benefit from the DVD and possibly OT's as well.

Therapists who work in a spa or any facility other than a chiro's office or rehab clinic may not use the majority of these techniques.",1173052800,7,1194,4.530232558139535
8128622,4,B000G1TQ7Q,"Just purchased this DVD and have been enjoying it since it arrived. Lot's of information, I've had to watch the DVD several times and find my head spinning well before it's over. Some of the stretches are common but there were many that I'd never used before.

Criticism would be sometimes the shot goes out of focus, and the client on the table is much more flexible than the average client. I would have like to have the muscles identified with each stretch - sometimes they are mentioned sometimes they are not - but once you have the stretch preformed on you or you perform it than the muscles affected becomes obvious.

I would and have recommended to my massage therapist friends.",1158796800,9,686,4.614754098360656
