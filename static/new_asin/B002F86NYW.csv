6429827,1,B002F86NYW,"This documentary was released 15 years ago in 2002 and is incredibly outdated. It is nearly worthless for understanding transgender people and replete with _many_ discarded stereotypes, misleading and even false information.

I cannot recommend this documentary at all as a vehicle for understanding transgender people",1481155200,13,318,5.913043478260869
6429828,5,B002F86NYW,I loved this documentary.  It was Not boring at allabout real people and it reported on their real lives and real issues.  Not boring at all.,1479600000,2,141,4.384615384615385
6429829,1,B002F86NYW,"This ""documentary"" might have been medically current 15 years ago, unfortunately today it's outdated and offensive.  It repeatedly uses the term Transsexual which is poorly descriptive and offensive since sexual reassignment surgery is about proper gender identity, not about sexual preference.  It also refers to Transgender people as having a mental illness, a notion which the psychological establishment as already done away with.  The WPATH transition process isn't mentioned in this documentary because it pre-dates that standard of care completely.
Amazon shouldn't even have this as a viewing option considering that at this point in time all the information contained within is dated, offensive, and even somewhat irrelevant.  It is not something that should be used to educate anyone on this subject.",1479600000,13,810,5.614754098360656
6429830,2,B002F86NYW,Interesting subject but the way they presented it was a little boring.,1479513600,,70,4.916666666666667

6429832,3,B002F86NYW,"I am just wondering what year this documentary was produced and ""whatever happened to...?"" I tried to locate this movie title on IMDB and Rotten Tomatoes (title but no year or review). I did not watch the whole movie, just the first half. It drags a little, not to be facetious but to the point - and there are happier stories. I have to say growing up around many gays/lesbians, I did feel the tug of ""don't do it!"" The male-to-female main character seems pretty alone socially but possibly that is due to filmmaker emphasis on nuclear family and not of same sex peers influencing a decision for a sex change. That is my first impression from the movie 'reveals all' standpoint. I did not see any graphic showcasing of actual medical scenes - but now that Amazon has the ability to fast forward on movies, I guess anyone can view the ending themselves.",1478131200,3,853,4.545454545454546
6429833,5,B002F86NYW,very educational,1477526400,2,16,7.5
8659200,1,B002F86NYW,"The constant misgendering was terrible - they even referred to these men as ""transgender women"" when, literally, its very VERY opposite of the truth.  Out of date and terrible. Move along, you'll find no good information here.",1527120000,,226,5.108108108108108
8659201,1,B002F86NYW,"One star, only because I cant give less.  Not only is this very dated, it is also flat out incorrect in so many ways.  It is full of information that was disproved well before it was produced (2002).  It is offensive in the extreme.",1498435200,4,232,4.2272727272727275
8659202,3,B002F86NYW,Very out dated views but still some good info. The terms have changes and the medical science has gotten better too.,1495411200,,116,4.571428571428571
8659203,5,B002F86NYW,Great documentary not sure why people are voting it down. It's old and outdated of course but I think it's great.,1494201600,,113,4.428571428571429

8659208,1,B002F86NYW,"Claiming to be made in 2016, the narration is horribly, irretrievably flawed. The ""scientists"" consulted to show that being transgender is a disease or that in children it often reverses itself with ""therapy"" (called reparative therapy as had been tried without much success w gays and lesbians) have been all but totally discredited. Dr. Wise of Johns Hopkins has NO credentials that would make him qualified to judge transgender people. There is a group of doctors at Johns Hopkins (or now retired) who have tried to ""prove"" being transgender is a disease. They did NOT do original research, but rather misinterpreted and twisted existing research. Kenneth Zucker is also a proponent of the religious right which claims we're an ""abomination."" They are guided by their bigotry and not by science.
Terminology used in this video is old and very out of date. It is no longer acceptable to say we are ""transgendered"" which would imply a process and that transgender is a verb. We did not change; we did NOT make a decision about our gender any more than a cis-gender male (not transgender) individual chooses to be male. ""Sex Reassignment Surgery"" is no longer a term... it is referred to as ""Gender Confirmation Surgery"". We are confirming the gender we know we are. Sex and gender are two totally different concepts but when they are improperly conflated, it can seem that we ""change our sex"" - again the appearance of making a decision.
DSM 5 does not identify transgender people as having a disorder - a mental illness - but rather ""gender dysphoria"" - suffering negative feelings because our bodies do not match the gender we know we are.
Before a child is even considered for a label of transgender, they must demonstrate persistence, insistence and consistence in their description of their gender. Opponents might say ""a child might say he's a dog. That doesn't make him a dog."" If a child wakes up every day with the understanding of being one gender, will not give up that stance and voices so strongly over a long period of time, it's pretty safe to say the child is probably transgender. Still, medical treatments won't start until a child reaches puberty - stresses of which in the wrong body can lead to suicide (41% suicide rate among transgender people). At that, the first treatments are puberty blockers - not hormones.
Further, the Harry Benjamin standards, while followed by many doctors is slowly being replaced by ""informed consent"", meaning an adult who is totally sure they are transgender (usually after knowing their gender since childhood and suffering for that understanding) after getting complete information, may start hormone replacement therapy.
Well, that's a bare bones start to my objections to this movie. In my opinion is it so bad that it should be taken out of circulation simply for it's inaccuracy. If it is preserved, it should serve as an example of how NOT to present transgender people. I will say that much of the family and trans individual's comments are largely accurate of trans feelings and issues family almost universally face.",1482364800,16,3080,4.936416184971098
8659209,5,B002F86NYW,IT WAS VERY WELL DONE. WE LEARNED A LOT.,1482105600,,40,3.5555555555555554
