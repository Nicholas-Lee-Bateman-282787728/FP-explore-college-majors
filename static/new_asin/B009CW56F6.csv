8539741,5,B009CW56F6,"I'm a Mike Stern fan and enjoy hearing him play and talk about guitar.  What he covers on this video is the basic chord tone soloing he has spoken on in other videoes he's done online, but this is nice because of the excellent video and audio quality.  Unlike other video online you can clearly see his guitar playing to study how he approaches the fretboard.  So if new to Jazz improv and soloing over basic changes this would be a good video for you.",1462579200,,452,4.294117647058823
8539742,5,B009CW56F6,Great to have Mike's tab and video (though the tab is wrong in couple place - so watch the video at the same time),1445558400,,114,3.7916666666666665
8539743,3,B009CW56F6,"Nothing here for intermediate or above. I like Mike, so I supported his video. Easy to follow if you're a beginner in the jazz world. Boring if you've been studying awhile.",1421020800,,172,4.580645161290323
8539744,3,B009CW56F6,"Okay video, not for the late intermediate/early advanced jazz player.  While Mike talks about important detail, it is knowledge that should be already possessed by experienced players: singing your lines, approach notes, a simple autumn leaves dissection, etc. More the 3/4's of the discussion is diatonic, and quite basic.  The only part I really enjoyed and appreciated fully (based upon my particular needs, of course) was the Blues solo at the end and the transcription.  More explanation about what's Mike's playing special could have been shown, as well as what makes jazz elusive to learn (ie altered notes, quartal harmony, etc).  No fault of Mike's, of course, but if you're expecting glimpses of sophisticated playing and explanation, you might be disappointed, as I was.",1418342400,,781,5.274193548387097
8539745,5,B009CW56F6,"I think I own copies of almost every recording Mike Stern has made (including as a sideman). I love his seemless blend of the most soulful aspects of electric blues and rock guitar vocabulary with a thorough harmonic understanding of jazz (especially bop). I also purchased the instructional video he did in 2001, as well as the ""Ultimate Play-Along"" book/cd set. For me, personally, ""Jazz Notes"" is the most informative and easy-to-decipher explication of devices Mike employs when improvising. The same information may be presented elsewhere and/or by other presenters; but it is great to hear Mike clearly lay out these important concepts. This is not a lesson for beginners - except that it may inspire. With humor and humility, this brilliant improviser discusses and demonstrates the importance of chord tones, of the Dorian scale in II-V-I progressions, and also how to incorporate these into playing blues. (Just listening to and watching Mike play the blues towards the end was worth the cost of the disc to me.)",1379289600,7,1021,5.083333333333333
