2267697,5,B00095NX96,"""Wave Explosion"" is a fabulous DVD 2 disc set, that will help you expand your belly dance vocabulary and strengthen your technique with its brilliant and innovative movements and the expertise of the beautiful Anasma, who is an international star as a dancer and teacher, and Future, who will amaze you with his liquid and imaginative dancing.

Disc 1 starts with an excellent ""Warm-up and Strengthening,"" where Anasma urges us to ""go to your maximum,"" but not beyond (it is essential to know one's physical/technical limitations when learning/practicing with a DVD, so as not to injure oneself). Anasma then gives us a choreography demonstration of the liquid fusion style, with its ""popping"" and isolations, and her incredible ""snake arms."" This is followed by a lengthy section where she teaches us slowly and in repeated segments until we can absorb these fascinating movements, and further practiced in depth in ""Drills and Dance.""

The 2nd disc features Fusion, who is a master at his art and has been dancing since 1980. He explains how dance can be a metaphysical concept, where one creates ""the visual illusion "" of a ""current of water"" traveling through one's body. He quotes Bruce Lee as saying that ""when you are like water, you can be everything you pour yourself into."" This is a ""zen/chi-mind/body"" workout, as Future patiently shows us to dance...or at least try...like him. Disc 2 continues with more of Anasma's teaching on arm and hip movements.

The final portion is a fantastic performance section with 2 from Anasma, 1 from Future, and 2 from Megatron. These are a treat to watch. Music is by Vin Scialla, David Starfire, Nikolai Ruskin, Pete List, and more.

Classifying this set as ""Beginner/Intermediate/Advanced"" is difficult. Everyone will get something out of it. You won't dance like Anasma or Future without years and years of training, however, the moves themselves aren't strenuous in the aerobic sense, but require enormous strength and controlled flexibility. Getting a hang of the smoothness of the isolations is hard, but if you have a gift and passion for dance, with some dedication and discipline, much should be learned from these 2 marvelous teachers. Also expert belly dancers will learn a lot from it.  Give this set a try, all 260 minutes of it. It's the dance of the future...and it's brilliant!",1268524800,25,2340,5.020618556701031

8057441,4,B00095NX96,"This is a cool and kind of bad ass DVD. I was a little disappointed that it was so focused on belly dance, and not quite as much popping and locking... and cool swagga lessons... but really this DVD is what it says it is. And it's fun.",1355270400,,235,3.9166666666666665
8057442,4,B00095NX96,"This video exceeded my expectations and my expectations were high!  The production quality is good, the demonstrations are well explained, and the content is as-advertised!  Thanks!  R",1292630400,2,184,5.7407407407407405
8057443,5,B00095NX96,"This is a fun, funky, feel-good DVD.  It has a feel-good warm-up with some kick-butt strengthening moves.
This is an intermediate to advanced program, as you are expected to know basic belly dance moves, and you are introduced to hip-hop concepts and movements.
The instructional portion breaks down locking, popping, tutting and waving and shows how to incorporate the moves into belly dance fusion.  It will take some time to do this program as it has 2 dvds of warm-up, instruction and demonstration, but you will have fun doing it!
If you are looking to add hip-hop fusion to your belly dance repetoire, this is the DVD to start with.  The performance section is fascinating and beautifully executed.  You are sure to enjoy this one!",1269648000,6,737,4.872
8057444,5,B00095NX96,"Wave Explosion is phenomenal! This program is a collaboration of two creative and marvelous hip- hop artists
who lead step to step into what constructs this unique style.  Anasma instructs her second belly dance/hip hop liquid fusion instructional dance program from World Dance New York. This time she is joined by ""Future,"" a hip hop artist/instructor. The program is very rich in content, a tremendous value for the money.  I would categorize this program as intermediate to advanced. If you have acquired belly dance foundations and have conditioned the body, you are well on your way for these fluid and resistant moves.

Liquid fusion is fun and modern and a perfect companion to tribal dance as well. So if you are looking to smooth out and add flair to arm movement, espcecially those arms waves, here it is! The  four hours of this program are packed with instruction and  much detail. Simple moves layered with this technique add the topping to basic moves. The drill section is non-stop so even if you are beginning, you will quickly gain muscle memory. In brief:

DVD 1 Anasma: A warm welcome is followed by warm-up and strengthening section with advanced yoga poses.  The hip hop belly dance choreography demonstration, (5 sections), choose your practice and breakdown: drills and dance flow, all drills, nonstop. Anasma instructs a dance flow which is a fantastic instruction/tutorial. She elaborates on the choreography with plenty of repetitions in this section carefully defining each segment.

DVD 2 ""Future""& Anasma: An absolute fantastic breakdown of Future's  dance theory or ""concepts"" on rhythm dimensions of waving. A complete breakdown on the concepts of timing along with movement, to produce rhythm in an easy and fun pattern from head to upper body, lower body. How to body wave? Future sections the body in ""drawers"" or layers to produce an undulating effect horizontally and vertically. His concept-Nonstop energy  forms water effect-liquid, undulating movement. Aanasma joins in to apply the same concepts to undulations, shimmies, hip infinity loops movements in belly dance.  The result- liquid fusion belly dance-gorgeous movement!  Anasma  moves further in instruction to demonstrate ""tutting, popping, locking, dime stopping"" moves which are usually seen in tribal style and of course traditional of  hip hop.

To conclude the program Anasma presents 2 performances integrating belly dance, liquid fusion hip-hop. Future  and Megatron each demonstrates isolated and intriguing freestyles in a performance of their own.

The underlying veracity of belly dance is beautiful on its own, yet it becomes more so; atop the terrific fusions that have evolved thru time as shown in this program.",1269561600,11,2723,5.280742459396752
