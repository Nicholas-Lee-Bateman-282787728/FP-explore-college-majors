I don't feel I need to say much, I mean come on, it's the Avengers, Earth's mightiest heroes, and if you're a fan of Marvel, you've been keeping up with the MCU, then why not add both of these to your library?  Both are fun films, and yes, both have flaws as any film does, but the fun and action outweighs that in my opinion.  Do yourself a favor and Assemble . . . .
