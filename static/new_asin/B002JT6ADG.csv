8371588,5,B002JT6ADG,My mother is hooked on Cory Street on the Canadian stations so it's always a good gift to find these special dvds on sale - good priced gift for a fan.  She didn't know these existed.,1440288000,,183,4.083333333333333
8371589,5,B002JT6ADG,"Not being able to see one of the most popular Brit soaps,I went ahead and ordered this because it sounded entertaining. Can only say Cilia must be as big a con as Sir Ian McKellen's Mel,he'd guested in several episodes as a writer taking the Book Club for ""a ride"",so to speak. I hope his appearances become available over here in America,he had me laughing,he was such a con artist. This movie was such a treat,I watched it 3 times yesterday. Hope the Romania movie is available in Region 1,too.",1412121600,,496,4.522222222222222
8371590,5,B002JT6ADG,"I've been a Corrie fan for 40 years and this special story was delightful.  The plot and acting are a bit OTT (in the same vein as Fawlty Towers); but then the Battersby's are always farcical.  Altough not my favorite,  this is enjoyable in and of itself  - even if you're not familiar with Coronation Street.",1395100800,,309,4.464285714285714
