8173781,5,B000N0P4K8,"This 24-minute video, narrated by Hugh Downs, provides a rare glimpse into the personal life of Pearl Buck and establishes a meaningful context for the examination of her achievements as a writer.  We are introduced to Green Hills, the 1832 farmhouse in Pennsylvania which she remodeled into the likeness of a traditional Chinese home,  and where she raised her nine adopted children.  Private rooms  for each  family member, each looking out on water, open to a central courtyard where the family could gather.  The furnishings and rare Chinese works of art bring to mind Pearl Buck's life in China and America, her marriage to her publisher, and her philanthropic  efforts to assist Amerasian orphans.  Narrator Hugh Downs artfully weaves together Pearl Buck's accomplishments as a Nobel Prize winner and her authorship of 90 books, establishing her as a distinguished writer whose works did much to create a bridge between the very different worlds of  the East and West.",1218931200,,974,5.113924050632911
