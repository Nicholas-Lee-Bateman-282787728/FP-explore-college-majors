5724927,2,B00CKYHH82,"Five Nickelodeon shows (""Bubble Guppies"", ""Dora the Explorer"", ""Blue's Clues"", ""Team Umizoomi"" and ""Wonder Pets"") are featured in this six-episode collection, which aims to teach preschoolers color basics like identification and mixing.

Unfortunately, just half of these episodes follow the rules.  The Bubble Guppies go on color-themed adventures in ""The Crayon Prix"", which combines color ID and mixing in fun, dynamic ways.  Dora saves a baby duck in ""Quack, Quack"" using colors (English and Spanish) during this simple, interactive story.  Finally, Joe and Blue serve up ""Colors Everywhere"", which actually features the mixing of tertiary colors like violet and chartreuse.

Team Umizoomi's ""Kite Festival"", though slightly color-based at times, doesn't belong here.  This is more of a math and shape-based show...so it's kind of entertaining, but in no way teaches colors.  Finally, the musically proficient but mind-numbing Wonder Pets appear in two shorter episodes (""The Moose in the Caboose"" and ""The Flamingo""), which vaguely revolve around color.  As in, ""they take place in a coloring book"".

So only half of the content actually fits the title, the A/V presentation is weak (""Bubble Guppies"" and ""Team Umizoomi"" are cropped to 1.33:1) and there aren't any bonus features.  It's a tough sell even at $14.95, as most kids would get just as much fun out of a few coloring books, a big box of crayons and a supervising adult that understands colors.  Most parents should probably resist the urge to buy this, even if DORA IS ON THE COVER!!! GET IT FOR ME, MOM!! OMG!!!!1",1375142400,,1580,5.205533596837944

5724938,5,B00CKYHH82,"If you are familiar with Nickelodeon, which you probably are or you wouldn't be buying this, it is a compilation of Nick shows that support color in the episode. Super cute. There are one or two episodes from each Bubble Guppies, my personal favorite, Dora and Team Umizoomie. They also have a cute, very small coloring extra, which is the cover of the movie box turned inside out. You see it when you open it. Unfortunately, you will have no cover if it gets destroyed while It's loose and being colored...lol.",1424304000,,511,4.626373626373627

5724946,5,B00CKYHH82,"My girls love all of the Nick Jr. Shows. This DVD contains six Color Themed episodes (really five full episodes) from different shows on Nick Jr. Amazon doesn't always do a good job on their DVD episode listings so here are the episodes that are included on this DVD:

2. Dora the Explorer - Quack! Quack! (full episode)
3. Team Umizoomi - Kite Festival (full episode)
4. Blue's Clues - Colors Everywhere! (full episode)

5724947,3,B00CKYHH82,"Right now I have a very curious 2 year old.  She is so different than my boys were and asks a million questions and just stands there and soaks everything in.  She also loves Nickelodeon and ""Let's Learn: Colors"" is awesome because it not only features all the characters she loves but its educational.  All the episodes are regular ones that have been on television before, but they are all focused on the theme of colors.  Each episode has something related to colors or coloring, it is great for young kids who are learning their colors or just love these Nickelodeon characters!  With two hours of fun and it broken down into episodes, it is a great DVD to watch a little here and there or all at once.  I am hoping to reinforce colors for my daughter as the episodes make it fun to learn!

I received this DVD to review in exchange for sharing my honest opinion.",1376956800,,867,4.415094339622642
