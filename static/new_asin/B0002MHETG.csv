2104994,4,B0002MHETG,"They're all here!  Some of the best and most entertaining non-skiers, non-boarders, non-smart individuals you'll ever see.  I picked this up to watch in the apartment and the bar during the ski trips.  Perfect for both venues.  Although we'll be skiing Europe and many of the people in the bar won't understand the narration, it really doesn't matter.  It's the agony of defeat that comes across best in these videos.  Thrills and spills a-plenty.

The only reason I didn't give this five stars is that much of the material in Skiing Bloopers comes from Winter Bloopers 3.  And what doesn't come from Winter Bloopers 3 really isn't that hysterical, except for the sumo skiers.  Yep, you read that right!

But this entire disk isn't made for deep thought, so pick it up and enjoy it for the entertainment value.  You'll get more than your money's worth of laughs.",1135987200,8,862,4.756756756756757
2104995,5,B0002MHETG,"I'm a Canadian, my husbands Australian, and we live in Australia with our 3 kids.  I bought this DVD for my husband @ Christmas 2004 and the kids watched it with us.  They now talk about it all the time, spcially the Australian sections!  We all agree that you have to be a skier, or have done some sort of outdoor winter activity to appreciate the humor.

We love Warren Miller's sense of humor mixed with his dry American accent...it had us in stitches!  The kids do a great job imitating his voice and have us laughing every time!

Very funny, a must see DVD!",1107043200,15,562,4.304761904761905
2105006,3,B0002MHETG,"Of course Warren Miller will probably always be the King of commentaries on skiing.  His videos are the best.  Although the price was moderate, we were rather disappointed in this particular video, because it flashes thru way too fast, and there is very little of Warren's humorous comments throughout.",1393459200,,302,5.142857142857143
2105007,5,B0002MHETG,"This is Warren in his earlier years, when filming was done on film.  The feature is a little rough and there are repeats, but Warren always makes it intertaining.",1391904000,,162,4.586206896551724
2105008,5,B0002MHETG,"This is classic Warren Miller humor and makes you glad for the newer style skis and regrets for the changes in ski fashion (or better, the loss of ski fashion). It reminds us that Kodac Courage really exists and riding the ski lift is still the best entertainment. Thanks Warren for the laughs-watching this over and over and over-we're still laughing.  ""Want your skis? Go get 'em""",1388102400,,382,4.701492537313433
2105009,2,B0002MHETG,There was WAY too much talking.  The great part of Warren Miller is the talking parts combined with humor and awesome skiing.  I bought this to show at a ski party but ended up not showing it because it wasn't good enough.,1387497600,,222,4.261904761904762
2105010,5,B0002MHETG,"I would venture to say it's a must have!  Warren Miller classics:  entertaining, good music and great bloopers.  It's a natural ski cabin movie for the entire group to enjoy!!",1367280000,,175,4.766666666666667
2105011,3,B0002MHETG,This video is dated but still stands up. The 'walking-on-ice' scene is absolutely hilarious.  You can't go wrong with Warren Miller.,1366588800,,132,5.285714285714286
2105012,5,B0002MHETG,We watched this over and over until our DVD player broke. I just pulled it out the other day to remind my husband we need to buy a DVD player real soon.,1360713600,,152,3.78125
2105013,5,B0002MHETG,"Classic Warren Miller does not get any better than this. Unlike the new breed of skiporn, this film has style, character, and is all set to the dry humor that Warren Miller is famous for. Anyone who survived the 80s & early 90s ski industry will most likely have plenty of flashbacks of happier times on the slopes if they watch this.",1360368000,,334,4.403225806451613
2105014,5,B0002MHETG,Another Christmas gift.  Son-in-law loves watching extreme skiing and especially Warren Miller.  Haven't viewed it but I'm sure he will let me know how it is,1355875200,,157,5.0
2105015,5,B0002MHETG,i love the bloopers blunders & bailout of skiing. it is always fun to listen to the classy warren miller narrate!,1353542400,,113,4.428571428571429
2105026,5,B0002MHETG,"This is a fun ski DVD to watch.  If you have seen the other Warren Miller DVDs, this one is just to enjoy in a different way.  Great for a good laugh!",1339372800,,150,3.65625
2105027,1,B0002MHETG,"Thought this would include more (and better) material from the Warren Miller films.  Disappointed 90% of these thrills and spills were in the past movies and repeated in the box set I also bought.  Even within this DVD it repeats the falls and skating on ice and chairlift pileups despite being split into two parts.  Where's the continuation footage of those fantastic jumps and you can see the skier's head between their ankles and the clip ends? If you buy the box set, leave this one on the shelf. It's a pooper!",1301788800,,516,4.586956521739131
2105028,4,B0002MHETG,Bought for a friend that loves to ski and goes to see all of Warren Miller's films. Filled with lots of wonderful outtakes & screwups!,1293494400,,134,4.4
2105029,3,B0002MHETG,"I used to love Warren Miller's movies.  I grew in a ski town and they were on every video stores shelf.  However there are so many well-done, blooper shows out there now that are more refined.  I bought this to introduce WM to my kids (ages 6-10), whom I am just getting into skiing.  Problems: 1.) They rarely laughed 2.)There were some inappropriate moments (2nd scene has bikini races, ""Family that skis...B1t@hes at each other"") and 3.) the two films share a lot of material so watched back to back is a little boring.  Sorry Warren, but I think my next ski-film $ will be going to Greg S...
  I was hoping to show the kids somthing to get them excited about skiing the next day and I think all I did was remind them how old I am.",1262908800,,734,4.237410071942446
2105030,2,B0002MHETG,"Being a big Warren Miller fan, I thought this would be a fun gift for my skiing husband. It wasn't up to any Warren Miller standard. It is two segments on one DVD and some of the clips are repeated from the first to second segment. Save your money and buy the boxed set. It has all of these sometimes lame clips plus good skiing and great mountain shots.",1227398400,2,354,4.144927536231884
2105031,3,B0002MHETG,"Initially DVD was great.  Very funny stuff.  However, when you click on the second half of the DVD, about 5 minutes in it starts repeating the videos from the first half of the DVD.",1199577600,2,181,4.294117647058823
2105032,4,B0002MHETG,This is a nice fairly clean review of my favorite winter sport.  Some parts are cuter and funnier than others but you'll enjoy watching it over and over; a good party pleaser.,1180656000,3,175,4.46875
2105033,3,B0002MHETG,I am a Warren Miller fan and always thought that his movies had funny moments. This DVD did not have the scenes which I remembered. It is average for entertainment value overall.,1168300800,,178,4.59375
2105034,5,B0002MHETG,"This is a wonderful addition to any Warren Miller collection.

Even if you aren't a skier, you will be entertained and amazed.",1168300800,2,126,4.7272727272727275
2105035,4,B0002MHETG,"Chances are you watch Warren Miller movies for the same reason you watch NASCAR...to see the wipeouts. ""Bloopers, Blunders and Bailouts"" is a compilation of Miller's best bits from all his movies.  The chances are good you've seen all the scenes before - since they've all been lifted from previous movies.  However, die-hard enthusiasts won't be disappointed with the outstanding footage and typical Warren Miller humor.",1140652800,3,421,5.363636363636363
8029382,1,B0002MHETG,It repeated the same thing over and over again,1509926400,,46,4.222222222222222

8029390,4,B0002MHETG,"I ordered this on a whim and it is just totally silly - crashes and burns, people sliding down hills out of control, (actual) dummies on skis - but gut-splitting funny.  Watch and be amazed.",1398643200,,190,4.428571428571429
8029391,5,B0002MHETG,"Classic outtakes of the famous Warren are really quite good.  This explains and establishes his film style for a new viewer.  We were not sure what we were ""getting into"" when buying this, but we enjoyed the DVD.",1395360000,,212,4.552631578947368
