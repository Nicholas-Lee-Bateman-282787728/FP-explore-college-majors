8166365,2,B000M53GK4,"OK I am writing this review about the presentation and not the 2 movies per se.  Firstly both movies have the option of Japanese audio with optional English subtitles - a big plus for me as I have come across so many Asian movies from the 80s and 90s with English dub being the only option.
Kunoichi: Ninja Girl is presented in 1.85:1 anamorphic widescreen and the audio and video are quite good for a lower grade movie and has the same runtime as IMDB.
Kunoichi: Deadly Mirage is unfortunately presented in non-anamorphic (letterboxed) 1.85:1 which IS NOT what the packaging says. The box cover states anamorphic however the case simply says 1.85:1. Either way, not correct. Also the runtime is 72 minutes whereas the DVD cover states runtime as 80 minutes (same as IMDB) so a few porkies being told here. Video is in fact cut by 8 minutes.
I picked the set up for $3 so can't complain too much.",1468800000,,896,4.530864197530864

8166368,1,B000M53GK4,"I love ninja, I love chambara action, I love the fictional Yagyu Jubei portrayals.  These two movies I did not love.  In fact, if I weren't so familiar with the genre, I don't think I'd ever watch another Jidaigecki again.

There are two movies in this set, ""Deadly Mirage,"" and ""Lady Ninja."" Deadly Mirage takes place during the waning days of the Shogunate and the Satsuma Clan assigns 5 kunoichi sisters to watch for Shogunate shenanigans.  Meanwhile, a demon is resurrected to kill the kunoichi.  ""Lady Ninja"" takes place during the early days of the Tokugawa reign and 7 kunoichi sisters must exact revenge on an evil lord who destroyed their clan - with the help of Yagyu Jubei.

No need to review each movie separately, though Lady Ninja is less painful of the two.  Granted,the filmmakers did not set out to make a serious drama,and were being cheesy on purpose - I hope.  In one of the extras, the director says something about hoping this is the ultimate ""B"" movie. Unfortunately the movies fail, pretty miserably.

The key elements of a ""B"" movie I enjoy are simplistic plot and great action.  The plot and the narrative presentation are extremely confusing and I pretty much stopped paying attention halfway through the films.  This leaves the action. The fight choreography is tolerable, but not really acceptable, and the special effects, which these movies rely heavily on, is also sub-par,except for one cheesy ""ninja"" magic involving women's nipples, which is the reason along with rape and half naked ladies running around in multiple scenes is the reason for the adult content ratings.

The end effect is that I couldn't follow the stories well, and the fight scenes and special effects were not enough to keep my interest.  I kept turning off the film and resuming later.  I saw the films in increments, and that was the only way I could manage watching the whole film.",1261785600,2,1889,4.808049535603715
8166369,1,B000M53GK4,I have no idea who rated this movie and what they were looking at.  The movie had the worse plot with cheesey graphics and fight scenes that had no chance of looking half way realistic. We could not figure the point to this movie even after the end credits were rolling but we laughed all the way thru this to keep from destroying the tv. The only good thing about this movie was the title and the names of the characters supposze to be in the movie.  If not for the semi rape scenes we would have completely hated this movie.  We guessed that was the only way to show women parts but please don't let that be a reason to waste your time or money on this collection.,1210636800,3,666,4.147286821705427
8166370,2,B000M53GK4,"Being a soldier in Iraq and learning Japanese, this set was just ok. I wouldn't pay more than $9 or $10 for the set. Acting was no better than a highschool drama. Special effect we not even subpar.",1206748800,5,197,4.2105263157894735
