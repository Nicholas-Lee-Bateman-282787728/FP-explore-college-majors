7857534,4,6303936997,"This is a very nice summary of Who Wrote The Bible? It looks at this question from a historical, investigative or critical thinking method of analyzing the facts available today. It doesn't take a side but allows the watcher to draw their own conclusions. It leaves you wanting to investigate further. I gave it only four stars because it isn't as thorough on the subject as I would have liked.",1356220800,,394,4.642857142857143

7857536,4,6303936997,"I highly recommend the ""Who Wrote the Bible"" video because it allows high school and college students (as well as adults) to explore some of the big scholarly questions about the Bible in an attractive,  professional format.  It gives students exposure to top scholars and allows  them to engage in questions they often have about the human side of the  production of the Bible.  I would especially recommend its use in  conjunction with Friedman's book by the same title which explains in  relatively simple language the JEDP theory.  While conservative churches  may not buy into the views espoused in the video, others will find the  exploration of the Bible's origins engaging and at times liberating.",911692800,15,705,5.052173913043478
