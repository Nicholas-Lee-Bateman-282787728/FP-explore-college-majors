7950882,4,B00005QVVE,"By the end of its first season ""M*A*S*H"" had established its foundation as television's first dramedy, a show that could combine comedy with drama, as amply proven in the landmark episode ""Sometimes You Hear the Bullet.""  More importantly, CBS saw enough to move the show to its powerhouse Saturday night lineup and put ""M*A*S*H"" in between ""All in the Family"" and ""The Mary Tyler Moore Show"" (think about that: three of the Top 10 situation comedies of all time back-to-back-to-back).  Not surprisingly, ""M*A*S*H"" was suddenly the number 4 show in the Nielsen ratings.
What we see in Season 2 of ""M*A*S*H"" (1973-74) is that Hawkeye (Alan Alda) is the star of the show but the other characters are now being developed as feeling human beings and not just comic characters; the change is most noticeable and ultimately most significant with Hot Lips (Loretta Swit).  This videotape has the first third of the Season 2 episodes:
(25) ""Divided We Stand"" (Writer: Larry Gelbart; Aired: September 15, 1973) is essentially a second pilot.  Functionally this was to introduce the major characters to new viewers, but it also showed returning viewers the new direction of the show.  When an army observer (Anthony Holland) shows up to check out the 4077th for reassignment, everybody pretends to get along--as long as they think the guy is not watching.  Grade A: the observer's critique of the 4077th hits the nail on the head about what the group (and the show) is now all about.
(26) ""Five O'Clock Charlie"" (Writers: Larry Gelbart & Laurence marks; Aired: September 22, 1973) is an inept North Korean pilot who is trying to bomb an abandoned dump near the 4077th.  Everyone is amused by the daily ritual except for Frank (Larry Linville), who gets a really big gun to shoot the plane down.  Grade B+: This is a military comedy episode but written by the show's two best writers.
(27) ""Radar's Report"" (Writer: Laurence Marks; Aired: September 29, 1973) has the corporal from Iowa detailing the odd events happening around camp.  The episode marks the first appearance of Sidney Freedman (Allan Arbus), there to see if Klinger (Jamie Farr) is nuts or not.  Grade B: A nice attempt to extend the ""Dear Dad"" idea to another character.
(28) ""For the Good of the Outfit"" (Writer: Jerry Mayer; Aired: October 6, 1973) has Hawkeye and Trapper (Wayne Rogers) trying to undo a cover-up when the Army accidentally bombs a local village.  Grade C+: The parallels to Vietnam are obvious and the docs have their hearts in the right place, but I have to think the Army would have squashed them like bugs or sent them to a battalion aid station (remember, this is the time of Watergate).
(29) ""Dr. Pierce and Mr. Hyde"" (Writers: Alan Alda & Robert Klane) is simply about the fact that after three straight days in the O.R. Hawkeye cannot slow down.  Grade B: Nice idea by Alda about his character.
(30) ""Kim"" (Writers: Marc Mandel, Larry Gelbart, & Laurence Marks; Aired: October 20, 1973) finally gives Trapper a moment to shine when he decides to adopt an orphaned Korean kid.  Grade B: The ending is a bit absurd, but seeing the serious side of Trapper John is a big plus.
(31) ""L.I.P. (Local Indigenous Personnel)"" (Writer: Carl Kleinschmitt; Aired: October 27, 1973) has the Swamp duo blackmailing an Army officer (Burt Young) so that a young G.I. can marry a local girl.  Grade B-: The plus is dealing with the issue of racism in the military, but the minus is the hijinks to get the guy to do the right thing.
(32) ""The Trial of Henry Blake"" (Writers: McLean Stevenson, Larry Gelbart, and Laurence Marks; Aired: November 3, 1973) has the military judging whether Henry (McLean Stevenson) is fit to command the 4077th.  Grade B+: there are some nice ""Rashomon"" moments in this one as Frank recalls how he remembers events.  Again, one of the cast members comes up with something that makes his character more credible and less of a joke.  It is because of episodes like this one that the death of Henry Blake had the impact that it did.
Although there is only one classic ""M*A*S*H"" episode on this tape, there are several that are close.  More importantly, we do not have any of the lame episodes that afflicted the show during its first season.  Of course, the glory days of ""M*A*S*H"" do not come until Season 4, so the best is yet to come.",1053993600,2,4327,4.73768308921438
7950883,4,B00005QVVE,"This tape provides the middle third of the first season of ""M*A*S*H,"" when Hawkeye (Alan Alda) and Trapper John (Wayne Rogers) were more interested in chasing pretty young female lieutenants than saving lives in the operating room.  However, the foundation was being set for the show to become television's first dramedy/black comedy and not just another military sitcom in the tradition of ""Sgt. Bilko"":
(9) ""Henry, Please Come Home"" (Writer: Laurence Marks, Aired: November 19, 1972) finds Frank Burns (Larry Linville) taking over the 4077th when Henry Blake (McLean Stevenson) is transferred to Tokyo.  Consequently, it is up to Hawkeye and Trapper, with help from Radar (Gary Burghoff) to get their bumbling but beloved leader back home.  Grade B-: Actually, the best part of this episode is watching Frank turn the camp shipshape, because getting Henry back is a foregone conclusion.
(10) ""I Hate a Mystery"" (Writer: Hal Dresner, Aired: November 26, 1972) finds Hawkeye playing detective when all the evidence suggests he is the one who has been stealing things from everybody in the camp.  Grade D+: I do not like this episode because it runs counter to the notion of family that exists in such a unit and because the real thief is so obvious that the final resolution seems forced.
(11) ""Germ Warfare"" (Writer: Larry Gelbart, Aired: December 10, 1972) forces Hawkeye to tap a sleeping Frank for a pint of blood for an emergency blood transfusion only to discover that there might be something wrong with Frank.  Grade B-: A minor outing but interesting because for the first time the guys show some concern for Frank as a human being.
(12) ""Dear Dad"" (Writer: Larry Gelbart, Aired: December 17, 1972) is an innovative effort to stretch the narrative boundaries of the show as a situation comedy.  Hawkeye narrates the episode as a letter home in which he reveals what is happening with everybody in the camp.  Grade A: This format was utilized several times over the rest of the series, including Winchester dictating a tape home, but it also marks the point where it is clear once and for all that Hawkeye Pierce is the star and voice of ""M*A*S*H.""
(13) ""Edwina"" (Writer: Hal Dresner, Aired: December 24, 1972) has the nurses insisting the guys find a date for the accident-prone nurse Edwina (Arlene Golonka).  Grade C-: Back to standard military sitcom nonsense; compare this with the next episode.
(14) ""Love Story"" (Writer: Laurence Marks, Aired: January 7, 1973) has Trapper and Hawkeye giving Radar a course in high culture (""Ah, Bach!"") to impress a brainy new nurse (Kelly Jean Peters) with whom the little corporal is smitten.  Grade B+: The first true Radar O'Reilly episode that provided the character with heart to go along with that ESP.
(15) ""Tuttle"" (Writer: Bruce Shelly, David Ketchum; Aired: January 14, 1973) has Hawkeye and Trapper creating a fictional captain so that his army pay can be donated to the local orphanage.  Grade B+: One of the better military comedies on the show, and the first decent script written by someone other than Gelbart and Marks; again, see the next one.
(16) ""The Ringbanger"" (Writer: Jerry Mayer; Aired; January 21, 1973) is an overzealous colonel (Leslie Nielsen) whose gunho attitude is getting his troops killed.  So the boys decide to do what they can to take the colonel out of action.  This is also the first episode directed by former child star Jackie Cooper, who would become a main director for the series in Season 2.  Grade B+: One of the first episodes to deal with the war against the war and how the doctors periodically tried to fight back.
Overall, the second third of Season 1 grades slightly higher than the first third; there is only one clunker in the lot, which is pretty good.  The show is starting to take things a bit more seriously.  However, it is the next tape, which begins with the most significant episode in the history of ""M*A*S*H"" that shows the series could play both comedy and drama, thereby reaching operatic heights.  To be continued...",1053907200,4,4033,4.882869692532943
