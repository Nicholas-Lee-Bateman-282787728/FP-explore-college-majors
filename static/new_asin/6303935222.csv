736016,2,6303935222,"Gung-Ho!, a war film that takes place 7 weeks after the Pearl Harbor attack and details the volunteers that form the new 2nd Marine Raider Battalion, is a merely decent film with a merely decent DVD. While worth viewing, it is hardly even approaching the peak of it's genre (held, in my opinion, by films such as The Thin Red Line, Apocalypse Now, and The Bridge on the River Kwai: better movies with better DVDs) and isn't worth a purchase. However, those other films come as highly recommended.",985046400,3,496,4.6477272727272725
736017,4,6303935222,"When I was growing up I used to watch Gung Ho everytime it came to television.  No at 50, and a former Leatherneck, I still enjoy this war flick. It is one of the progaganda films made during the war. The story is about the creation of the Marine Raiders and moves right along with the training and battles these men faced in the Pacific. The acting is good, the pace is fast, and it gives a taste of America when we still remembered that we were ""meant"" to Win Wars. Randolph Scott gives a good performance as Col. Carlson, founders of the Raiders.",970617600,2,549,4.278846153846154

No, he was an officer in the navy. He said he was a marine in the Solomons and his sergeant was named Butterfield.
I happened upon an obit while googling, one Franklin Wells Butterfield. He was born Feb. 4th 1927 and after Pearl Harbor was attacked he joined the marines, at the age of 14. He served with Carlson's Raiders. By the age of 16 he was a decorated combat veteran. In San Francisco he met a girl and they married in Reno.

The laboriously lengthy speeches that blocked you from thinking of landing on an island with monkey snipers on trees. The lengthy brother scenes and so forth. And how fast it switched from I hate japs give me Chow to I like Japan and cold war China with Mao and crazy Chang with Rhee in D.C. as socialist pigs ready to run you down with your own stockpiled ammo. How blind humans can be when we fight for God and hell and heaven and hell when instead we look at what we're really fighting for is some visionary future of our dreams on earth. How quickly an enemy can be an ally in a quick turn and friends your worst backstabber for more living space they cannot even tend to in their lazy dreams. And how naive inexperience can be a quicker turn with rising Fury against those when carefully analyzed in their operations are quick to fire their ammo so wastefully against a quick thinking and long haul maneuver. The islands of the Pacific will later be more of a lure instead of Europe as vacation and tourist spots unless art architecture lit majors historians etc. I would think some on female parts would be to just clear those monkey trees for air strips and landings as too dependent on subs while risking air attacks. But that's just me commenting in retrospect of amazing action scenes put into war moving story with digitized and preserved 35mm film.  I love war action scenes where I just want to just jump right in and give them fighting guerillas myself and have them running. And that's just the thing, that as movie watchers we don't realize how physically exhaustive and painful some of those maneuvers can be.  As the Oriental japs fought inch by inch, tooth and nail, and didn't give up until they began to finally see that visionary dreams for the future manifest in business enterprise, technology, and goods into the international markets that they slowly saw the fruits of our labors that they also vied for to finally fling open their cold closed door to flood their goods likewise with blue prints from Japan.  How entwined Japan and China was in their strategic operations was something I always questioned and how much the white house and the president would conceal to the public in their ""fireside chats"" that made them seem so gentle while maneuvering these wars.  My first thought upon entry is food supply, ammo, and how long before they're exhausted into retreat and how much do they want this and what for. To think just devils and so on, is to me too tunnel vision'ed or driven by empty, and then I will pause and wonder how low human can go in times of war, and what I must do to singly see that I remain alive to carry out my future visionary dreams on earth in the end of that tunnel.

737303,3,6303935222,"GUNG HO! is a by-the-numbers propaganda-style war movie shot during WW2. It tells the story of the 2nd Marine Raider battalion -- how it was formed, how it was trained, and its first experience in combat with the Japanese. It is absolutely typical of the films of that period, and labors under a staggering burden of war-movie cliches, some of which have become so anachronistic as to be outright hilarious, but which at the time probably hit close to home; and it remains mildly entertaining and a good example both of American war movies generally, and of wartime propaganda.

The film begins just after Pearl Harbor. The Marines are forming a special unit under the gentlemanly Colonel Thorwald (Randolf Scott, taking off his cowboy hat to put on a Marine cover). This all-volunteer outfit will consist of the roughest, toughest, nastiest S.O.B.'s the Corps can produce, and naturally, that includes guys from every walk of life, including an old-school leatherneck nicknamed Transport (Sam Levene), a cool-headed immigrant officer from Greece (J. Carrol Naish), a pair of quarreling half-brothers (David Bruce and Noah Beery, Jr.), a hot-tempered punk kid from Brooklyn (Harold Landon), a big galoot hog farmer known as Rube (Rod Cameron) and an ex-prizefighter called Pig Iron (Robert Mitchum)...among other soldaten right out of Central Casting. After a long, tough period training, during which we get a comedic-romantic sub-plot which pits the two half-brothers against each other for the affections of a Rosie Riveter-type (Grace McDonald), the Raiders deploy via submarine to attack a Japanese radio base in the Pacific, and test their mettle against the hated enemy, who outnumbers them two to one and can be expected to hold the island to the last.

As I said, this movie is chock-full-to-bursting with cliches. The Americans are courageous, insolent smart-allecks who rarely miss a shot, while the Japanese are cunning, treacherous and extremely stupid. Officers are depicted as warm, intelligent and caring while the NCO's are loveable old salts (I kept thinking of Gunnery Sergeant Hartman in FULL METAL JACKET...not quite so loveable!) The training montages are effectively designed to show the ferocious skills required to be a commando, while the battle sequences are lively and brutal, though ironically the Americans are much better at judo than the Japanese, who invented the art. Oddly realistic moments, such a chilling conversation between Marines about how best to kill a man with a knife (""If you do it like this, he can't scream!""), contrast with Hollywood hokum of the worst sort: guys get fatally wounded and say things like, ""Thy will be done!"" to the tune of the Marine Corps anthem, or, even worse, ""When do we get to Tokyo, sarge?"" Et cetera and so on. Still, the corniness of GUNG HO! is a large part of its charm: it reflected the style of the era, and despite the heavy-handed means by which the message is delivered, there's no doubt that the producers wanted people to understand that this war was not about winning the war but rather winning the peace after it was over -- or, as Thorwald says, ""Constructing a social order based on freedom!"" A bit heavy, but not out of line with what I've been told by veterans of the Big One was their actual motivation for fighting. They wanted to smash tyranny and build a better world, and if that meant 40-mile marches, sweltering temperatures, malarial mosquitos and the very real possibility of dying a horrible death, so be it....and GUNG HO!",1422316800,,3524,5.011945392491468

Remember Roosevelt's famous line ""We have nothing to fear but fear itself"". The president, saying this on national radio, zero's in on what was corroding people's minds at the time. It is not something said when there are giant rousing victories occuring, but when despair is lurking. This film was like a shot of hope. Yes it is simplistic in a way, but it was made for a time when people were not yet jaded and bloated by a constant bombardment of media content. Saw this when I was a kid, and loved it.

My reaction at the more recent viewing was that it was pretty hokey and cornball.  It is a movie that was made in a very brief amount of time and for a very specific reason.  It was propaganda, pure and simple, and designed to get the American public to support the war effort and contribute to U. S. Bond drives.  It was also intended to demonstrate that the U. S. was prepared to take the war to the enemy.  It really was not very different from other movies made during the early '40's, i.e., ""Back to Bataan"", and ""60 Seconds Over Tokyo"", to name only a couple.

737869,4,6303935222,"This 1943 film about the Second Marine Raider Battalion in the South Pacific is based on a true story. Hollywood adjusts the facts to provide dramatic events, even if not a war-time film. Lt. Col. Evans F. Carlson had experience before WW II; he joined the Chinese Eighth Route Army to learn about their successes. The peasants out-fought the Japanese troops because they believed in their cause. (And maybe had a far larger supply of people.) In San Diego they ask for volunteers for a special mission. The volunteers are interviewed and tell about themselves; they all had something to prove. They will receive unique training, but they must cast out all prejudices and work in harmony (""gung ho"" is the Chinese phrase for teamwork).

Rigorous exercises put them in peak physical shape. They learn all the tricks of judo and unconventional fighting to win and survive. These scenes are explicit. Col. Thornwald says the weakness of the Japanese troops is the inability to react quickly to unexpected conditions. [That is true for many others as well.] There were ""Meatless Tuesdays"" and rationing for civilians. The Battalion views the destroyed ships at Pearl Harbor. The battle of Guadalcanal and Tulagi is ongoing. Two submarines will transport the 600 men to their destination, Makin Island. They will invade, kill all the enemy troops and destroy the installation by using the element of surprise. That's the stated plan.

Japanese airplanes (which look like repainted F4F Wildcats) attack the submerged submarine unsuccessfully. [The film shows ""ashcans"" not the small bombs carried by fighter airplanes.] Rubber boats take the men ashore. Jap snipers in trees begin the battle. Heroic action neutralizes a machine gun nest, and the attack succeeds. Walkie-talkies are used for communication. They must next attack the radio station. Two marines take advantage of an enemy vehicle for their attack. The approach of enemy forces cause a withdrawal. Some wounded were left behind! A clever ruse causes the Japanese airplanes to attack Jap troops. They must leave the island before the Jap navy task force arrives. Colonel Thornwald ends with a speech about ensuring freedom after the war ends. [How did that work out?] There are no surprises in this formula movie.

737872,4,6303935222,"I love a good war movie, but there's something extra special about a war movie filmed while the fight is ongoing - especially when it recounts the story of a major victory that has been largely forgotten by history.  America's initial offensive thrust into Japanese-occupied territory took place at Makin Island (Butaritari atoll), and Gung Ho! is the story of that mission as carried out by the 2nd Marine Raider Battalion (Carlson's Raiders).  The strategic importance of the mission is now a matter of some debate, but at the time it was seen as an important diversion intended to disrupt Japanese communications and draw some of their forces away from more important targets (particularly Guadalcanal and Tulagi).  There was no attempt to actually occupy the island - this was a quick, decisive raid designed to take out every Japanese installation (especially the radio tower) and kill every Japanese soldier on the island - get in quick, get out quick, and leave nothing but destruction behind you.

The Makin Island operation provided an important boost to morale back home, and this film obviously was made to further bolster domestic support for the war.  As a propaganda film (and I must say I hate calling any film that passionately espouses the causes of liberty and freedom propaganda), it's a real winner: we lost some boys on that island, but the mission was a complete success, and the patriotic speech at the very end puts a great big morale-boosting bow on the whole package.  As history, the film doesn't hold much water.  Not to take away from the bravery of Carlson's Raiders (which included FDR's son), but the whole mission was basically a mess.  Just about everything that could go wrong did go wrong - but you won't hear any of this in the film: more elaborate plans had to be altered due to choppy seas and heavy rains (one boat never got the new orders); the landing was chaotic to say the least; overestimating the size of the Japanese forces on the island, Carlson chose to withdraw that evening but could not get his men back to the subs due to the inclement weather, which in turn led him to actually surrender during the night - until, that is, he finally learned that his men had all but wiped out Japanese resistance already; and nine men were unknowingly left behind (and eventually beheaded by the Japanese).  Some of his men later questioned his leadership abilities.

Obviously, the true story of Carlson's Raiders would not make for a good movie, especially during war-time.  As a morale booster and as entertainment, however, Gung Ho! is highly successful.  It follows the volunteer recruits who made the cut all the way from their rigorous, unorthodox training to their overseas journey tucked inside two submarines (this was the only landing via submarine during the entire war) - pausing to take in the remains of the attack on Pearl Harbor on the way - to their landing and fierce combat on Makin Island.  The acting is quite good from top to bottom and includes such well-known actors as Randolph Scott, Noah Beery, Jr., and a young Robert Mitchum (who is one fellow I would certainly want in my army).  I was a little disappointed in the actual combat scenes, though - after hearing about all of this unconventional training for the mission (Carlson taught his men how to fight dirty, knowing full well that the Japanese would fight dirty at every turn), the actual fighting turned out to be fairly conventional for the most part (but the hand-to-hand combat does portray the viciousness of the fighting pretty effectively).

Gung Ho! is a notable wartime film from 1943, but it turns out that the true story of Carlson's Raiders and Carlson himself is much more interesting than Hollywood's version of the August 1942 raid on Makin Island.  Carlson is a fascinating man, having fought in several foreign armies (including a stint with the Chinese Communist Army) before America entered World War II.  His Gung Ho! battle cry reflected his training philosophy of ethical indoctrination; to him, every soldier was equal and was to be treated as an equal, for only then could the necessary sense of community make his men the most effective fighting force possible.  He was quite a maverick in the military, in both tactics (drawing heavily upon Mao-ist guerilla warfare) and political philosophy (insofar as he leaned noticeably toward Communism).",1150156800,16,4392,4.880376344086022

737876,2,6303935222,"Some movies really don't age well.
GUNG HO! is a creaky old warhorse.  It tells the story of the Second Marine Raider Battalion from its formation shortly after the Pearl Harbor to its first mission, a raid on Makin Island.  The battalion is a volunteer outfit, so the first question the movie asks of its young stars is ""Why do you want to kill Japs?""  The Kentucky hick and the Brooklyn toughie and the ordained minister all pretty much say the same thing - because I don't like them.
 The film follows the recruits through training and graduation to deployment and finally battle, with a short detour for a sloppy little romantic subplot.  GUNG HO!, released in 1943, is based on actual events.  The Marines' successful raid was big news back in those bleak days.
  This is more a curiosity, a study of the value of propaganda on public morale, than a historically accurate document.  Some of its inconsistencies are pretty jarring, though.  For instance, Colonel Thorwald (Randolph Scott), the commander of the battalion, gives an inspirational speech at the beginning of training.  He exhorts his men to ""Cast out all prejudices, racial and religious,"" and learn to act as a, well, band of brothers.  The men may have taken it to heart, but you can't help but notice there are NO people of color, save for a Filipino volunteer, in the unit.  The only African-American in the whole movie is a cook on the transport submarine.  It probably wasn't noticed when the movie was released, but it does seem a little ironic now.
 Col. Thorwald delivers a few more ""Some of us are going to die for democracy and freedom and equality"" speeches, which are set in stark contrast with the behavior of the Japanese defenders.  Fighter pilots laugh as they strafe ground troops.  A badly wounded GI, begging for water, is brutally bayoneted by a Japanese soldier.
 If you like standard issue war movies, I guess you'll like GUNG HO!  Be warned, though.  On the cover of the dvd case it looks like Robert Mitchum is pictured next to Randolph Scott, and it seems like they're co-starring.  Mitchum has a relatively minor role in this one, much smaller than those played by the likes of Alan Curtis and Noah Beery, Jr.
 And the dvd appears to have been transfers from a handy print.  There are splotches and splashes and scratches throughout the whole thing.  A bargain bin purchase at best.",1082160000,4,2377,4.713592233009709
737877,3,6303935222,"I'm a high school history and American studies teacher, and I sometimes show this film to my classes as an example of Hollywood's role in WW II.  As a piece of cinema, it's pretty bad, filled with a lot of jingoism, ethnic stereotypes, and cornball humor.  Compared to our modern portrayals of combat e.g. Saving Pvt. Ryan or Band of Brothers, the battle scenes are laughable--and I do often hear laughs in my classes, often at the wrong times.
As an artifact demonstrating what the United States thought of its war effort in 1943, however, Gung Ho is interesting.  Like so many other Hollywood war films, it follows a multicultural unit of American soldiers through their training and into their first combat.  The characters' names tell the story:  Sgt. McBride the tough Irishman, Lt. Christopoulos the self-made Greek immmigrant, Frankie Montana, the Italian from Brooklyn who has a chip on his shoulder, the fighting half-brothers O' Ryan and Richter, who both love the same girl.  The unit commander is the resourceful Col. Thorwald (German/Scandinavian), played by Randoph Scott, who molds them into a single fighting battalion, in much the way that the WWII United States was molded into a unified nation of immigrants to meet the international threat of fascist totalitarianism.  Thorwald's motto is  ""Gung Ho,"" Chinese for ""work together harmoniously.""  On a number of occasions he makes extended speeches into the camera to emphasize how important it is for the soldiers/audience to follow the motto, win the war, and establish a just and lasting peace.
Several other aspects of the film make it interesting, notably the presence of future stars in early roles.  The most obvious is Robt. Mitchum in a small part, but you can also spot Noah Beery, Jr. (later of The Rockford Files and numerous other shows) and Rod Cameron (TV westerns of the 50s).  Plus old-time Hollywood character actors like J. Carroll Naish and Louis Jean Heydt.  Another interesting aspect is the (very muted) left-wing influence.  Thorwald is apparently based on Col. Carlson of the Marine Raiders and perhaps Gen. Stillwell of the army, and is an admirer of the revolutionary Chinese communist army of Maozedong (although neither of the words ""communist"" nor ""Maozedong"" is mentioned in the film).  He adopts his tactics and philosophy from Mao!  Although I don't know Carlson's background, I suspect this facet of the film is based on his actual experience and training philosophy, and I do know that Stillwell traveled with the Chinese Red army during the 1930s and ended up admiring it.  (See also the novel Once An Eagle by Anton Myrer, which covers some of the same ground.)
So:  Gung Ho is a bad film with some interesting background/sociology connected with it.  Better WW II films which employ some of the same ideas include Guadalcanal Diary and 30 Seconds Over Tokyo, which I also use sometimes in class.",1063238400,9,2900,4.993762993762994
