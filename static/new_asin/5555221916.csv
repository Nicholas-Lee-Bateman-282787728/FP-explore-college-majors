205001,5,5555221916,"A subtle, overlooked English treat, ""On Approval"" is top high-brow English comedy in the vein of Oscar Wilde and Noel Coward. Though the British upper-class reserve is ever-present, it's integral to the comedy, with the proper English language employed like a rapier. It's also a rare cinematic opportunity to see Clive Brook and stage comedienne Beatrice Lillie in action. Sophisticated, irresistible fun.",1125964800,10,406,5.564516129032258
205002,1,5555221916,"I am a great fan of Frederick Lonsdale's play ""On Approval,"" yet I can not recommend this movie version of it.  I know many people love it and have nothing but praise for Lillie and Brooks' performances, yet I found them so stiff that they appeared like zombies.  Lillie holds a constant frozen smile for so long that she hardly seems human.  Brook, when told he's nothing more than the spawn of illigitimacy, shows absolutely no reaction at all.  He's so stiff that it doesn't come across as the famous British reserve but rather as if he's comatose.

Quite appart from the performances, the rewritten version of the play for this movie isn't as sharp and funny as the original. The new ending is particulary disappointing.

For a excellent version of this oustanding play, and to see how much better it is when done properly according to the original play, try to locate a copy of the BBC-1's version produced in 1982 for the ""Play of the Month"" show.  This version, starring the great Jeremy Brett and even greater Penelope Keith, is absolutely perfect in the delivery of the performances and sticking to the original play.

205003,5,5555221916,"Clive Brook and Beatrice Lillie star in this arch (and, for the time, fairly risque) English comedy about a would-be couple trying out ""married life"" for a month before they tie the knot.  Complications ensue, but this movie is less about the actual plot than about the tart zingers the ""bad"" character toss about like darts from a quiver.  There are some real zingers, perfectly delivered and deliciously, unrepentantly mean-spirited.  A fun movie, considered by many to be one of the best British comedies ever made.",1039737600,9,518,5.0
205004,5,5555221916,"This is one of the best comedies ever made.  An absolute romp through the 19th century outlooks and the problems encountered by four improbable companions two of whom are looking one another over with the prospect of marriage.  The witch, so to speak, of the four makes the movie.  Her performance as the hard to get along with rich widow is magnificent.  The rest of the crew do a great job as well.  The ending is not what is expected but it is a happy ending which makes the movie even more fun.
A must see movie for all comedy fans, especially romantic comedy.",1015804800,13,564,4.384615384615385
205005,5,5555221916,"This is a sophisticated, light comedy of the highest order. It works at every level: acting, directing, pacing, production. Especially for those who tend to appreciate the often higher caliber expertise of movie-making out of the 1940s, this movie will be bright and fresh. It holds its own with the best of that era, yet is so rarely seen today that even connoisseurs of sophisticated satire and gentle wit scarcely know of its existence. For anyone who enjoys ironic word plays, playfully disparaging witticisms, and occasionally biting satire upon upper-class manners -- all done in grand style -- this movie is a joy to experience. The DVD release corrects the sound and other technical problems of the VHS version, allowing the movie to be recommended without reservation for those who appreciate this style of comedy. Don't miss this one!",980121600,17,844,5.079136690647482
205006,4,5555221916,"Circa late-19th century, a shrew of a woman agrees to marry a proper English gentleman ""on approval"", that is, after a trial period of living as man and wife.  Not that he'll be actually be staying with her,  though--there's a hotel across the loch and ""you will find the dinghy  by the jetty"".  Turns out the hotel is ""full up"", and the  gentleman's buddy, a bankrupt, self-important duke is along for the  trip--so's her society friend, so all four end up sharing the house for a  time--when the servants see them coming, they see deviant behavior ahead  (remember the time period) and vacate the premises.  So, there they are:  as time passes, they will gradually drive each other nuts.  Favorite part:  the Duke asks the betrothed and formerly wedded bride ""Is that the  former Mr. Wislack?"" as he points to a mounted moose head on the wall.  Lots of underplayed dry British humor here for those of that bent, and the  movie is particularly creative at the outset, with a false beginning (this  comedy of manners starts with an aerial dogfight), and a wild shared dream  sequence near the end.  Pauline Kael calls this comedy  ""dadaist""--it's wonderfully anarchic at times.  My copy (which is  the same according to the photo above) has rather poor sound quality;  you'll have to listen closely to get most of the jokes, but it's worth it.

205009,5,5555221916,".... greatly enjoyed for many reasons. The play which I saw on stage in my youth, the chance to watch Bea Lilley in action, the crazy fantasy and all in Cecil Beaton costumes. What more could anyone want on a cold night ? It's a shame there are no subtitles as it's not all that easy for non-native English-speakers to grasp the cut-glass accents even if the supposed Americans sound quite British.  Blu Ray should make this more accessible though prive may be an obstacle.",1365638400,2,473,4.564705882352941
205010,4,5555221916,"This classic comedy offers a rare glimpse of the great Beatrice Lillie. This is an old classic film beautifully restored in a pristine Blu-Ray print. The comedy is full of fast comedy cracks and a look at high style British upper class. For a rare look at a comedy gem, this is a classic.",1365465600,,288,4.351851851851852
205011,5,5555221916,This is a must if you are a performing arts history buff. It is one of the very few lead performances by Beatrice Lillie. This alone warrants seeing On Approbval,1365379200,,161,4.4

Such good comedic writing.  A very enjoyable film.",1326499200,,211,4.833333333333333
205013,4,5555221916,"According to Image, this is an uncut British restored print and not the cut American version.  It looks quite good and while watching you can see why it may have had censorship problems here.  No issues other than a 1996 copyright for the restored print during the credits.",1302912000,,273,4.666666666666667
205014,5,5555221916,"In 1943, Clive Brook, a good British actor, produced, adapted and directed this early 1920's comedy of manners by Frederick Lonsdale.  It stars Brook, as well as Beatrice Lillie (in one of her few film roles), Googie Withers and Roland Culver.  Brook changed the setting to late Victorian England, which serves the material even better than it did in the early 1920's, when the original play was to have taken place.

The basic premise:  Maria Wislack (Lillie) is a widowed woman of 41 who's very exacting.  George, the 10th Duke of Bristol (Brook) is poor and down on his luck, despite his title and his very dry, exacting nature.  Richard (Culver) is in love with Maria, but hasn't the funds or the courage to propose marriage.  Helen (Withers) is in love with George, but she cannot get George to think of her as a possible bride.

Maria gets Richard to propose with the understanding that they go off to her house in Scotland for one month's trial ""marriage"", on approval.  What transpires is each finding out much more about each other.

The dialogue is bright, dry and wicked, at times.  Brook did a wonderful job adapting the play, directing the film and working with the designers to produce wonderful sets and costumes.  Everything's absolutely perfect about the production....except for one small complaint.  Googie Withers is a terrific actress, but she's playing an American in London and Wither's British accent is all wrong for the part.

This film has become one of my favorite films...good for repeated viewings.  This Image transfer is perfectly acceptable, without it being a proper restoration.

Highly recommended....if for no other reason, for you to see the legendary Beatrice Lillie in one of her very few film roles.",1272412800,6,1740,4.927835051546392
205015,5,5555221916,This is the classic romantic comedy with all the elements of classic English drama.  The clever wit coupled with fantastic cinematic choices makes this well worth your time and will leave you laughing for the rest of the day/week.,1195516800,4,230,4.897435897435898
205016,3,5555221916,"Several reviewers have given this DVD five stars. The play certainly deserves them, but regrettably not this film. It retains much of Lonsdale's wit , but both visual and sound quality are a disappointment, and the action, translated from stage to screen, waters the material down.

One reviewer urges Amazonians to look for a recording of the 1982 BBC production with Jeremy Brett and Penelope Keith. He's right! It's a much better, more enjoyable production. But until it becomes available, this film version is the best we've got. Pity.",1180569600,5,539,5.056179775280899

The wit is fast and fleet, hitting you in between the eyes, leaving you breathless from its quickness and fury.  The opening vignettes are hilarious, a perfect setup for what's to come.
Also, Beatrice Lillie isn't to be missed; she's absolutely brilliant, especially whenever she's singing at the piano.  She made only a handful of films; such a pity, as she's a gifted performer!",1480982400,2,538,4.763440860215054

7802391,5,5555221916,"Just to see the upper crust dry humor of the late Victorian Era played out in a comedy of manners and potential marital mayhem by a superb cast of Brits who perform the dialogue with brisk and droll delivery as dry as a tin of biscuits left over from that era is worth watching and adoring.  Watching Googie Withers and the incomparable Beatrice Lillie (why oh why didn't she do more films???????) put their two prospective bridegrooms through their thoroughly bred paces is indeed funny.  Clive Brook (who also wound up directing after a false start with another director at the helm...his name escapes me) and Roland Culver, a delightfully amusing fellow indeed, provide the male half of the quartet as they pursue wealth and love from the two ladies who are neither too sure of their prospects suitability.  All of them coming together for a month of trial and error at Bea's Scottish Island Estate.  It is a comedy only the British could do and has rarely if ever been done better.  The attitudes alone will appall modern audiences...but the quick witted asides and oh so veddy been there, done that world weariness of the participants will delight you.  Googie Withers plays an American heiress by the way.  The only yank influence on the proceedings and she acquits herself quite well despite being as British as the other three.  I was tickled all the way home with this one and guffawed more often than I realized til later.  It's a true treasure from the 40's and one of the rarest of rare opportunities to see Bea Lillie on the screen at all.  So if this is your cup of tea you'll find no finer brew.",1393459200,3,1610,4.5979020979020975
