8436124,5,B004MNKPSI,Fabulous. I have only recently discovered Donna's art and love her work. The DVD is inspirational and gives a clear idea of process. If only she could pass on some of her magic too!,1418515200,,181,4.352941176470588
8436125,5,B004MNKPSI,"If you have admired Donna Zagotta's paintings,  and wondered how you, too,  could learn to paint that way,  then this is the workshop for you!  In two and a half hours of instruction Donna takes you through every step of her process,  from selecting a subject and carefully simplifying and refining the design to choosing your colors,  applying them in many layers, until you like what you see!  Donna's paintings are representational,  but not 'realistic'.  She intentionally simplifies and 'flattens' her designs,  focusing on shapes,  contrast,  and color,  and aiming to stay 'loose'.  If you like paintings that look like photographs,  this is probably not for you.

The DVD is expertly produced,  focusing the camera on the painting while Donna explains every decision and every brushstroke.  Not a moment is wasted!  The menu lets you access each of the 32 steps (chapters) individually,  and special features include shape exercises,  an extensive gallery of Donna's paintings,  and 8 pages of printouts: her reference photo,  the preliminary drawing, the light pattern drawing,  the brush drawing,  the finished painting,  Donna's studio palette,  and a list of shape relationships to inspire your own compositions.  These pages can be printed out on your computer,  and are extremely helpful as a reference while you work on your own painting.

Surprisingly,  Donna's palette consists of transparent watercolors with the addition of  Permanent White Gouache.  Her process however resembles that of an oil painter,  as she works up to a thick layer of paint the consistency of toothpaste.  The advantage of this technique is that you can change your mind as many times as you need to,  as you explore where you want to go.  While the carefully worked-out design provides the framework of which only minor details are changed or eliminated,  choosing and applying the paint is a seemingly endless process of discovery. This is at times frustrating to watch,  but actually fun to do,  as it takes much of the anxiety out of painting with watercolor.  To prevent the dried paint from cracking,  Donna works on Crescent board rather than watercolor paper.

The quality and detail of instruction, complemented by a generous gallery of Donna's paintings, make this a very worthwhile investment.",1352160000,13,2297,5.16120218579235
8436126,2,B004MNKPSI,A bit blah....slow. Unidimensional. One demonstration . That's it! Hoped for so much more.  For the amount of time and money there could have been several demonstrations done.,1349913600,5,175,5.25
