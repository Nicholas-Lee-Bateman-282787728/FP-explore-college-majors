4912800,5,B0060MYM3S,"I went into the first season of Game of Thrones without having read any in the popular book series titled&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Song-of-Ice-and-Fire/dp/B004JN1D2I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Song of Ice and Fire</a>.  By the end of the first season I was so captivated by the story that I decided to read the books.

Upon reading Game of Thrones, Book 1 in the series, I was surprised and delighted by how closely the HBO series mirrored the 700+ page book. And it was really cool to have faces and persona with all of the characters...especially that of Tyrion Lannister played precisely by Peter Dinklage.

I am halfway through (as of this writing) the second book (this one almost 800 pages) of the series titled A Clash of Kings and based on how closely the HBO adaptation has once again almost mirrored the written work, I probably will abandon the extremely wordy George RR Martin and just stick with watching the show.

And the show is excellent. Season 2 has taken more liberties from the source material than I noticed with season 1, and some of the detail in some of the most memorable scenes in the book have been lightened a tad for TV (i.e. when Tyrion confronts Pycelle); but it's all good and obviously anyone who has not read the book(s) will be none-the-wiser. I suppose that a standout descrepany from book to screen is that the ages of several of the prime characters have been elevated from teen to young adult. I guess that HBO was not ready to push the envelope with all of the graphic material...especially the sex...involving teens.

We all know the fate of season 1's main character Ned Stark, so this year's main character is certainly Tyrion (even though Tyrion really stole the show last year too). I had hoped that season 2 would continue with more detail of Daenerys' (and her dragons) plight, but there is clearly a reduced role there in season 2.

The best story arcs in season 2 are seen through the eyes of Tyrion and Arya. You don't want to move from your seat when it's their turn for the screen. Tyrion's wit and banter are as sharp as presented in the books, and it's easy to empathize with Arya's perilous predicament and feel like you're right there journeying along side of her as one of her youngling companions. Tyrion and Arya's escapades are more entertaining to watch than anything on TV right now. (I will say that anyone believing that Arya is a boy is a tough sell that needs to be taken with a grain of salt for the first few episodes of season 2.)

As per the book, you also see arcs presented through the eyes of Sansa, Catelyn, Jon, Bran and Theon. However some deviations from sticking to seeing through the eyes of the main characters are present in order to better develop certain characters and/or story lines.

The HBO crew has created magic with Game of Thrones. It is must see TV for any fan of the book series. It's a fantastic drama aimed towards an adult audience, and any fan of the fantasy genre not watching this should be thrown into one of the Black Cells.",1334793600,44,3080,4.711895910780669
4912801,5,B0060MYM3S,"I am unthinkably lucky. My favorite book series of all time has been turned into one of the best television shows of all time.

And I'm not the only one who thinks so! Critics love it, award shows laud it, and record-breaking millions of viewers are tuning in.

The dialog is superb, flowing with hidden subtext, overt emotion, political posturing, unfortunate truths, nave admissions, and much more. And each line is perfectly acted! I don't know how they managed to fill an ensemble cast of this scope with such talented actors, but even the children are impeccable. Joffrey conjures uncontrollable hatred, managing to be one of the most contemptible characters to grace the screen, and at such a young age! I feel bad for that kid. There's no way anyone will be able to look at him the same again.

Season 2 picks up after the shocking events of season 1, which I won't mention in case you haven't seen it. And if that's the case, what are you doing? Go watch it right now!

The death of a monarch has left the land of Westeros in political turmoil, rulers declaring themselves kings on every corner of the map. As the inevitable war ensues, we follow the various leaders, rooting for the most honorable, but simultaneously fearing for their lives, for this is a dark show, and the most just cause is often the most treacherous. Our heroes do not have the strength of numbers, but rather the strength of character, and that does not win wars.

The season launches us headfirst into this maelstrom of a power struggle, introducing us to even more characters than before. For people who haven't read the books, it may be a bit hard to follow, but the show does its best and usually manages to pull it off. The two newest additions to the battle for dominance are Stannis Baratheon, eldest brother to the late king, and Balon Greyjoy, father of Theon Greyjoy and perpetual enemy of house Stark.

From the moment you meet these characters, you'll be awestruck by just how high quality this show is. HBO spares no expense, and their money is put to good use. The new sets are stunning, from Stannis's table carved into a likeness of all of Westeros, to Balon's fireplace, crafted into a giant Kraken.

Back in King's Landing, we once again finds ourselves enjoying Peter Dinklage's Tyrion as he continues to cleverly maneuver the human chess pieces that make up the court. He's definitely this season's hero, and he strikes a perfect balance between likability, morality, and underhanded politicking. As the season goes on, even more people die, the stakes are raised, and a sense of impending doom settles across the land.

If you love the realism of the series, you may be shocked when things take a turn for the magical partway through the season. Still, the sorcery is artfully done, and while it's a bit hard to fathom, there isn't much of it to get used to. By the halfway point, situations have become truly dire. War is most certainly brewing, the lands north of the wall promise ever-increasing danger, and the clash of kings continues.

And what a clash it is! Episode 9 presents us with what is quite possibly the most incredible battle in television history. Only on HBO could a show achieve such heights. The tension of the women awaiting the outcome, the gruesome brutality of war, the chilling fact that no matter how much you prepare, in the end your fate is decided as much by random chance as by skill--it's all awe-inspiring. Whatever stalling the season might be guilty of is justified in this amazing episode.

And it definitely is guilty of some stalling. Daenerys doesn't accomplish much, but the resolution to her storyline is satisfying. And even if you didn't think that was enough of a season final&eacute;, I have just one word for you: zombies. Or maybe two words: zombie horse.

This is a show of deceit and of honor, of love and betrayal and politics, of war and the base desires of man, of monsters and of loyalty, of sex and lies and conniving. It is made with the utmost sincerity, doing service to the source material, and expands upon that material with brilliant scenes we could not have witnessed in the novels.

There is plenty of violence and nudity, so bear that in mind, but that is not the heart of the show. Rather, those aspects serve to underscore the themes of the story. These characters live in a dark world, and they must make the best of it while they can. After all, Winter is Coming.

UPDATE: Packaging is gorgeous, although the DVD case is somewhat flimsy, but what can you do? Getting the digital copy was super easy. I followed the instructions and downloaded all the episodes off Amazon Unbox without any problems, and was able to watch them on my PS3 immediately. Admittedly, my TV is only 720p, but the picture quality of the discs was impeccable. Have only run through everything to make sure it works. Can't wait to watch the extra features and update again!",1334707200,449,4917,4.657439446366782
4912802,5,B0060MYM3S,"Right off the bat the tension and intensity of the show is higher. Coming off of last seasons finale it's almost as if things haven't settled down at all. The war is heating up, the characters are falling deeper and deeper into the complex narrative, the story is getting darker and darker.

The first episode earns 8 out of 10. I don't give it a better score because it was scattered, but to be quite honest this was the best that could be done in this case, with so many plot threads to breath life back into.  Wonderful job, and it only promises to get better as the story moves forward.

I will try and update with every new episode aired. There will be no spoilers.",1333238400,20,670,4.301587301587301

4912828,5,B0060MYM3S,"Most of the poor reviews are all about their media not working correctly or getting the wrong item.

There is a reason why almost everyone who watches GoT loves it:

It is just so well done on so many levels.  There aren't really any plot wholes that I have seen.  Things you would have NEVER noticed in Seasons 1 or 2 were there, and always there, as plot points get fleshed out in Season 6 and 7.......ARE YOU KIDDING ME!!!  Compare this to most shows that have silly plot holes all because they higher a couple new directors and writers who don't give a lick about continuity.  This show has continuity IN SPADES!!!!

The ONE thing that would cause me to ding it a little is the obnoxious use of the word C-U-N-T.  The only people who I know that use this word regularly are GoT watchers.  This series is single-handedly making that a ""cool"" word for nerds to use.  It's over use softens the impact of when it does get used.  It would have been more interesting for the series to have developed some of their own curse words.  Honestly, I'm a sailor, and no one uses c-u-n-t as frivolously as this show.......at least they didn't before this show.",1522713600,,1150,4.423809523809524

The first season started out strong and then they gradually killed off the interesting characters leaving mostly the 20-somethings to take turns screwing and fighting over the throne. Repetitive, formulaic, predictable, boring. By the end of season 2 Tyrion is the only interesting character left. I hope this gets much better ASAP or I don't think I can make it through another 5 seasons.",1506211200,,713,4.796747967479675

4913032,5,B0060MYM3S,"Although the content of the show is a bit much for me personally, there's no doubt about the cinematic and content quality of Game of Thrones. I have nothing super special to say about it that most likely hasn't already been said, but for those who haven't yet dived into Martin's world brought to the screen, I highly recommend it (even if the show does of course deviate from the books). Naturally, the Red Wedding episode of this season specifically will haunt me forever. Great show, if a bit gratuitous for me. I also loved the extras provided with the DVD set, from the bloopers to the book-to-screen adaptation process and more.",1505865600,,635,4.678571428571429

4913137,4,B0060MYM3S,"This could easily be a 5 star series.

Pros:  Interesting story lines, excellent acting, costumes, sets, etc. A good array of special features. Dragons and other supernatural elements thrown in for good measure.

The actor/actresses are especially good.  You find yourself intensely disliking/liking a character very quickly.

Con:  Unnecessary explicit scenes depicting brutality/depravity towards women and children.  Deducted one star from rating for this. Showing less/imply more during these scenes would be a big improvement since many are totally not necessary for the story line.

Best episode was #9 (the Blackwater battle)",1501372800,2,632,5.793478260869565

However, with that being said, I did finish it because the story is phenomenal, the sets are amazing, the costumes are breath taking....and the acting is well pretty darn good...I was disappointed with the unnecessary pornographic sex and extreme violence. The story is so great and a lot of those situations could be ""implied"" rather than camera in your face stuff. I thought HBO could have told the story without all the graphic violence and still maintained a phenomenal fantastical story.  It could have been right up there with Lord of the Rings.....Unfortunately they chose to cheapen it.

4913289,2,B0060MYM3S,"For the show itself, 5 stars wouldn't be enough.  I think it's extraordinary.  But I'm rating the DVD sets here.  I purchased Seasons 1-6 as the separate sets, have watched them all and I'm just shocked and frankly angry at what poor quality these are.  The picture is just awful, particularly in scenes that are dark.  Think VHS quality.  I do not exaggerate. And it's every season, though oddly enough, some episodes are worse than others.

I really don't understand this.  I have many other shows on DVD, including HBO ones, and none of them are like this.  Muddy, blotchy, artifact-laden image quality, and sometimes even skipping.  For disclaimer's sake no, it is not my player, not my TV (I've tried them on a few players and screens), and these are the legit, licensed sets.

Then there's the packaging itself.  The ""fat"" sets that fold out with a disk on each page (versus the ""stacked disk"" sets) are also crap.  The plastic disk holders have a tendency to come unglued from the cardboard backings. I've heard others mention the same issue.  Again, I have other sets with a similar design and this doesn't happen with those.  What the heck is going on with the quality control where they're making these?  GoT deserves better.

Anyway, I can't recommend buying these.  And considering some of the problems I've heard with the BluRay disks, too (and my own negative experiences with BluRay players which makes me steer clear of converting over to that format), I'm not tempted to purchase again.  I'd recommend renting the shows instead and save your money, perhaps check a local library for them.  I may, in fact, donate my sets, as I'm not sure I could stand watching them again.

P.S.  Amazon, FFS, keep the different media and edition review sections SEPARATE!",1491609600,,1772,4.778877887788779

The first season, was a bit hard to keep up with all the different characters and families then on top of that, you needed to know whom each person sought to be ""in a family"" or an enemy of the throne families. Towards the eighth episode of season 1, we were able to see this series really come together. Needless to say season 2 was a lot more intriguing because we both knew, whom stood with whom. This series has the potential to be one of the most suspenseful series I have ever watched. As the series takes you to the bitterness of cold to the fantasy of dragons and magic, it lures you in to a suspenseful story line that keeps you wanting to watch the next episode. Many of my husband and I's friends were regular watchers of GOT's and they are always asking us what part we are up to, so as to not spoil the story live for us. Although the series is a night time, shut your door type of series, due to the appropriateness of the context , if you have children, do make sure they are tucked into bed and asleep, because the series seems to relish in its gore and also blantant in your face ""sex"" and sexual content.  In closing I would say that anyone who watches Games of Thrones will be intrigued by the loyalty and plagued by the disloyalty, for some, are the way of war and for others whom seek out justice.",1486252800,5,1362,4.159090909090909

Even though I have already seen all the episodes to date, each episode is so rich in detail that I learn new details with each watching. I love that I can access all seasons via HBO subscription. There are times that I have to close my eyes during the very realistic, and appropriate to the story, violence. Go figure--a squeamish retired nurse. Otherwise, I love the series. Human nature is human nature whether it is expressed in fiction or in contemporary news reports. I've never read the books and feel no need to do so, as the series is depicted so well that I don't feel as I am missing important details, as I do with so many movies.",1485388800,,745,4.405797101449275

I give it 4 stars instead of 5 simply because the extremely graphic violence becomes tedious for me personally. I realize this is a subjective call, and others may disagree.

New characters are introduced, and new plots unfold, but everything that is done is meant to gain the Iron Throne.  As in the last season, the penultimate episode is the best, and we are given the visual majesty which is the Battle of BlackWater.

I have seen this in audio cd's and video reviews but thought it was a slim chance it would happen to me. If you order from amazon listen or watch as soon as possible.

Well about the series not much but what HBO charges; a whole lot.

I can stream for their competitors like Netflix and Hulu for about half the cost with a lot more diversity of content.  Instead of $15 they should be charging about $4.

It never ceases to amaze me that big media outlets like HBO think that we are so stupid that we don't recognize when we are being gouged. Nobody likes being gouged and gouging your customers is not a good long term business strategy.",1481241600,,506,4.294736842105263

I bought all the other seasons at my closest store but I just couldn't find this box set, and I didn't want to buy the other blu rays because well... it just wouldn't fit with the collection. The moment I saw this particular one was ~$19 I knew it was the one I was looking for. I guess since it says that the digital code expires February 2017. Whatever the case I'm glad I found it. The product it's knew but it did look a little worn out (not noticeable if you aren't looking for it), it was released on 2014 so I guess it makes sense.

4916159,4,B0060MYM3S,"Season two continues the story from where it left off in Season one introducing a number of new faces and deepening plots and stories.  It contains unexpected twists and unexpected surprises and leads into Season three. Some highlights:

Joffrey is now King of the Seven Kingdoms; his Mother defines her powerhold at his side as Queen Regent.  Sansa's father is dead, Arya escaped, Sansa is in Kings Landing alone. Elsewhere her immediate family is in open rebellion to the crown and holds Ser Jamie Lannister captive.  Cercei declares Joffrey is to remain betrothed to Sansa and Sansa suffers the brunt of all of his deliberate childish cruelty.  Joffrey sends his Knights to murder all bastard children who were sired by his buffooned father, the late King Robert.

Tyrion governs well as Hand of the King in his father Tywyn's stread and becomes uncomfortable as he witnesses the common people begin a prelude to physical action;  their hatred of the new King, their knowledge of his true parentage is proclaimed by adept orators on key street corners throughout Kings Landing.

Arya travels North with her Uncle, a knightswatchman who increases the number of men in the watch by inducting new watchmen from the criminals housed in the different dungeons across the land.  She is disguised as a boy and one of her traveling companions is a bastard son of late King Robert Barathian.

Winterfell ..  Bran finally wakes up.  Everything above his waist seems to have escaped permanent harm.  Village idiot Hodor, is Bran's legs.  Bran acts as Lord of Winterfell and listens to and judges complaints presented to him.  He has strange premonition dreams which always contain a three-eyed raven trying to show him something.  Osha, the captured wildling woman from Season One helps care for both Bran and his younger brother, Riccon.

The late King Roberts' youngst brother, Renley makes claim to the throne, allies himself with House Tyrell, gains a large Tyrellian army and marries attractive Margaery of House Tyrell.  A strange knight, Brienne of  House Tarth, secures herself a position as Kingsguard to Renley after winning a public joust with the new queens' brother and Knight of Flowers, Loras Tyrell.
Renley would seem to be the best choice for King until his strict preference for the samesex and the fact that his several weeks old royal marriage remains unconsumated, is revealed.

A grieving Daenarys and a small loyal group of Dothraki and Sheep people continue to wander the Red Waste unable to locate water, food, or relief from the agonizing heat and sun.  Survival instincts force further maturity upon Daenarys.  The newly hatched baby dragons become a unique leverage that can open the ancient gate into their last hope for survival.  An ancient seaport, abounding with water, food, shelter, riches, and ships.

Rob Stark, declared the King of the North also needs ships.  Against his mother Catelyn's advise; Rob sends Theon to meet with his father, King Baylon Greyjoy of the Iron Islands to present his request for ships.

Jon and the Knights Guard go beyond the wall and spend time at a Knights Watch friendly stop, Craster's Keep.  Samwell, Jon's non-violent friend falls for Gilly, pregnant wife/daughter of Craster.",1477612800,5,3240,5.030018761726079

I checked the rest of the discs and it was the same for the disc 3.. I contacted Amazon and they did replace it but the replacement took about a week to get to me so it was a bummer.

4916377,2,B0060MYM3S,"I loved Game of Thrones and had to snag this, after the package arrived I noticed some sticky residue on the outside of the sealed item. Closer inspection I had thought something melted on the inside so I began to open it, further inspection showed fingerprints (with the same sticky stuff) UNDER the sealed and ""Brand New"" item that I was buying from as if the item was handled before resealing. The sticky residue in question (Provided Pictures below) smelled like Potpourri or a strong sweet perfume which was saturating the inside spine of the steelbook and on the outside edges. Nothing was ""Melted"" on the inside since the only thing inside would have been the blu-ray discs and the paper inserts since the entire rest of the case is metal (or some type of aluminum) The Discs at this time of writing work fine, just had to clean them from said stuff above.
About the item itself, it was another amazing Collector's Item with the magnet sigil plus the digital code to redeem to itunes, vudu or your other favorite streaming cloud. I just wished it came in better condition, it would have been alright if the outer case cover had it, since a quick wash cleaned it off quickly.",1472428800,,1181,4.601895734597156

4917533,1,B0060MYM3S,"Warning: If you plan on buying the Blu-Ray versions of Game of Thrones or any other HBO shows from other dealers such as Amazon, Best Buy, Walmart, Target etc and the disk is defective don't expect to return it to HBO to exchange a disk.

Blu-Ray disk 1 of Season 2 was defective. Episode 2 of disk one would freeze at 36:04 and skip to the end. There appeared to be no scratches or damage on the disk. I emailed HBO if I can exchange the disk. An HBO consumer representative name Mary said that ""they only honor exchanges or replacements if it was bought from their online store at HBO not from other dealers"".

What? I never heard such a thing. HBO are the ones who manufactured the disk not Best Buy or Amazon. Professional manufacturers usually take responsibility if the items they manufactured are defective. Buy the digital versions in iTunes or Amazon or subscribe to HBO GO, Netflix, or Hulu. Blu-Ray disks can be as defective as DVD's. Streaming and digital downloads is the way to go not physical disks. Blu-rays and DVD's are obsolete just like CD's.",1466467200,,1062,4.554973821989528

4917692,5,B0060MYM3S,"I bought this mainly for the collectible steelbook and magnet.

 MULTIPLE COPIES 
You technically get three different copies of the series:
1) Blu-ray (physical discs)
2) UltraViolet 1080p HD version (digital copy, HD only available on some devices)
3) iTunes 1080p HD version (digital copy)

The digital code gives you two digital versions (which is rare, and appreciated).

 STEELBOOK and MAGNET 
This steelbook has artwork designed by Elastic, the agency that created the Emmy Award-winning opening credits, and has a magnet on the cover that can be removed and used as a regular magnet, or left on to show off as a collector's piece. Each season represents one of the major houses of the series, and this season two steelbook represents House Lannister of King's Landing with its Gold Lion sigil on the magnet [see photos]. The steelbook is in a matching decorative plastic outer case that holds the magnet in place so it doesn't scratch the steelbook. Depending on how this was shipped, this plastic may or may not be cracked as I've seen a lot of cracked plastic cases with the steelbook intact.

 THE SHOW 
The show is greatin acting, in storytelling, in visuals, in music, and in writing. I've watched everything at least three times, and there are so many new things you see when re-watching, and with the knowledge of future episodes. The second season continues by showing the aftermath of the game-changing first season, which I will not spoil. It has some amazing character chemistry and interactions you would not expect to see, and if you pay attention to what they're saying, you will be glad when the payoff comes. The season ends with an exhilarating battle (now that HBO gave them the budget). ""OMG, geesus, that was exciting,"" was what one friend recently said.

I have converted many friends who previously used to think this was about ""dungeons and dragons and lord of the rings,"" (like I did) who are now *all* addicted to the show. If you don't already know, this show isn't about what you think it may be about.

This is currently THE only good show on television, and if you don't like it, you probably don't understand good television (sorry, not sorry). It has been the number one torrented show in every single year since it came out for a reason (which is a blessing and curse for the producers). After watching this, everything else on TV becomes: ""why I am watching all these other crappy shows?""

This is one of those series that I will buy the individual season sets, and whatever big box set comes out in the future. GAME OF THRONES! Recommended.",1465171200,6,2581,4.773033707865168

Anyway I also have the First Season and can see what everyone has been talking about. This is a great series and I am waiting for Season 3, Season 4 and Season 5 to drop their prices so I can continue the adventure. Peter Dinklage is a fantastic actor (as are most of the cast) and I'm rooting for him to be crowned King before the final season (Season 6) ends since now I have HBO. (I'll still buy that set also anyway.) The CGI is incredibly done (I can not detect any 'cartoony-ness' that you get with some CGI loaded films even though you know dragons especially don't exist but your belief is suspended when they are on the screen). I plan on reading George R. R. Martin's books when this season ends. (Of course from AMAZON.COM) I always hate having to wait for the next episode when they just leave you hanging there for a week going..""What..what...what happens next?!"" I've always enjoyed watching Lena Headey act since she played John Connor's mother Sara on TERMINATOR: THE SARA CONNOR CHRONICLES. In fact the whole cast was an excellent casting decision. If you haven't seen the series. D yourself a favor and buy the seasons box sets. I promise you won't be sorry.",1464912000,,1307,4.495798319327731

4918082,4,B0060MYM3S,"Let's start with the actual DVD extras as otherwise why bother and just go watch this On Demand. There are usually two different commentary tracks to each episode so if that turns your Twinkie, go for it. Before you even start Episode 1 you can see a review of Season One to remind you how we got there. There're also reviews of previous episodes and previews, if you want, before you begin each episode.

On Disc 5 there is an over 30-minute look at how the assault on and defence of King's Landing was filmed. It's actually better than what shows up onscreen to be honest. There's also a 20-minute plus round table (Knights Of?) discussion with the creators and a few of the main actors (and surprisingly Emilia Clarke with her natural dark hair is far cuter than the weird shocking white old lady hair of her Dragon Lady persona in the series). Finally, there's an explanation of the religions in the series which, frankly, helped me as I completely tune out this sort of worshipping of imaginary friends for adults (not that I find religion uninteresting, but I'm with the black dude pirate when it comes to religion).

Speaking of color, we finally see the world of Game Of Scones actually is not so Wonderbread white as it was in Season One. I found the city of Qarth (that's Q pronounced as a K so again with the is it Jamie or ""Hi-me"" spelling of Jaime) wonderful for the eyes from the dark and dreary white people lands to the west. Gold Goalie Mask Lady I want way more of. Even weirdo Bald Magic Chemotherapy Michael Stipey Looking Man/Men are worth their screen time. It's too bad things went sideways there because all the adults are pretty much dumbos even in this gorgeous city.

Anyway, there's still the annoying editing choice to cut scenes off abruptly, move to another location's storyline then return right back where we got cut off. So D- for editing really. Plus Fake Denis Leary, the Kingslayer Hi-Me Lameystair, is captured, escapes...and gets recaptured but we never see how. Why would they not film this? I mean, any prisoner escape and subsequent chase is perfect for building tension. Then of all the tall people in the series, if Jammy is going to be held prisoner, have him onscreen way more than the boring Starks or Bariumtheorys.

Then I'm getting sick of seeing the Watcher dudes by the Wall wandering around in obvious winter conditions with heavy pelt coats but no toques. Do your heads all have built-in heat sources?

It's also pretty obvious that the Scottish Iceland zombies (White Johnny Walkers) are the real threat but even so the stories around brooding boreface Jon Snow and the Wall are still way way too dull. Other than Scarlet Head Captured Woman who rips off some excellent flirtatious lines, I could do with almost zero True North Strong And Zombie World.

Then the flatchested British women whose breasts are apparently vitally important to the story are becoming tiresome. Is this a series made for people who can't use search engines? We get it--sex drives men crazy and sex gets women what they want. I'm going to have to say the ""SNL"" sketch pretty much nailed the nudity--a 13-year0old must have been hired as a ""sex scene consultant.""

The series totally jumps the sharks for those of us who have seen decades' worth of stuff like this when Scary Redhead Lady (Carice van Houten which you should see in Black Book--a beyond excellent movie about the Nazi occupation of Holland that has way more interesting twists in its 145 minutes than a season of Game of Poems) gives birth to a Shadow Smoke Monster who kills one of the two gay dudes in the series. If there are now Satanic black magic forces available, why aren't these being used to end all this nonsense? Just send a few of these Smoke Monsters out to kill off the right people and done like dinner you're queenie on the throne.

The animated intros are similar but different as lands are added as the plotlines start to include them in. It's a pretty cool yet effective trick.

Lastly, what is up when you have a roomful of people often in the middle of a meal and some person comes and wants to have a private conversation with another person? Given these are castles with a zillion rooms, every single time, EVERYONE but the two people who want to converse privately must leave the room. Baffling.

Anyway, Season Two is far more entertaining than One as we get some sunny climes and far less reliance on rapes and beheadings. The political intrigue is great but, in the end, the dopeys in this you know are just wasting their time fighting because the zombies from the North are going to kill everyone in the end. (And, no, I have not read the books nor looked ahead online other than to know about the non-Billy Idol Red Wedding coming up in the next season.)",1462579200,,4780,4.606345475910693

4918268,5,B0060MYM3S,"I won't say much about the series itself as its acclaim can speak for itself. But this specific release on Blu ray, which comes in a slim plastic case rather than the more bulky cardboard case, is marked as being the same standard Blu-ray release that came out in 2013 with the DTS-MA soundtrack. That's what Amazon says, that's what blu-ray.com says, that's what the packaging says. Yet when I opened it up and put the discs in my blu ray player, I discovered that I had the new release with the Dolby Atmos (True HD 7.1) soundtrack. So either this is a mistake during packaging, or the cover was mis-printed, either way it was a very pleasant surprise.

Yeah, that's what I thought.

I was a fan of the books for a few years before the television series came out. I don't know what I expected, but I am SO pleased with the adaptation. There are, of course, a lot of bits and pieces left out. I honestly feel like it's a visual guide for the readers, albeit an excellent one, but my non-reader friends who have watched the show are really, really into it as well. I'm a little cautious on how the series will go after season five, but I have faith in the directors. They haven't made too many errors as of yet.",1460851200,,626,4.208333333333333

I checked all the other discs to make sure they weren't the same and its just the first one. I'm a little pissed off cause I paid $30 for this season and I can't even finish watching the first episode.

First off the Atmos remix is absolutely worth it if you have an Atmos system at home. The audio quality is top notch and the top sounds really add to the atmosphere. As for the video quality, it too is impressive with low compression rates and only two episodes per disk in order to accomplish it.

Like the books, story and character development are exceptional.  I've read all the books twice, so I do know what is going to happen with the story.  Still, it is delightful to SEE the characters, the settings, and the action on screen.  This is very unlike me; I usually read a great book and find I'm not interested in seeing the movie.  HBO's Thrones programs ALL offer GIFTED actors and quality production features -- these programs are just so outstanding, I can't help myself!

There is no new video content, only Atmos sound. That being said, for those who have or will soon buy an Atmos system this edition is well worth purchasing. The new Atmos audio re- mix is ,quite simply, spectacular. Even with my rudimentary 5.1.2 Atmos system the sound is more immersive than anything I have ever experienced from my home system. Rain sounds like it is falling downward. Overhead sounds sound overhead. It really adds a lot to the enjoyment of the program. The metal case is kind of nice and the collectible magnets look nice. Two relatively minor negatives are really weak magnets which slid down mi fridge when I put them up and a really bad (IMO) system inside the case to hold in the discs. Each disc is stacked, 3 on one side, 2 on the other, on top of each other. This makes them quite difficult to remove. You must bend the discs quite a bit to remove them. The stacking also increases the risk of scratching the discs. I have removed the discs and keep them in a disc storage unit. In conclusion if you have orplan to buy an Atmos system, buy the steelbook edition. If not, don't bother.",1446768000,10,1324,4.3861788617886175

in stores in theory Nov 3 2015 - in store price 40 dollars each, online 50 dollars each.
(most likely will be 40 dollars online - target matches its store prices)
Now you know the math on second seller mark up

2) Think its a bit late to be releasing a ""limited set"" two + years latter, for more than
the regular set and not includes high end DVD's as well.

3) At these prices,and you have not been watching Game of Thrones, wait for the super mega box set.
True Blood (series) and an exclusive Disc with it (Best Buy Only)

4) This show is Awesome, you see how events unfold, why they unfold in that way, and it makes sence.

Truly one of a kind, George R.R's series finally punched a hole in the ""nerdiness"" that is medieval fantasy stories with his brutal, heart wrenching tales. Although season 2 isn't as true to the books as season 1, it still parallels the books quite well compared to later seasons. Most story lines stay fairly true, there were some significant differences in Rob's story line but I suspect things will wind up in a similar fashion. As always the show doesn't quite compare in the level of detail as the books, but it really is an excellent rendition. I would recommend reading the books before watching the series. Season 2 captures up through book 2, mostly.",1434499200,,797,4.782608695652174

Too bad, much is lost in humanizing the female roles throughout the entire series, especially season 2.  Season 2 is also somewhat confusing as there are so many kingdoms introduced yet not fledged.

I realize that the author of the books and the producers of the show put the sexual violence there because it's a matter of harsh reality that where there are males and females, there is sexual violence. Still, lost a star for sexual violence due to how strongly I feel about the subject. Wish it wasn't part of the books or the show.

Same as the other seasons. As true to the books as can be.

My only/biggest beef is the gratuitous sex. Although the books did have sex and other adult content, the television series took it too another level, made many scenes more explicit than need be and added sex scenes where there were previously none. I suppose some of that was a quick way to develop the characters as lascivious and teetering on the boundaries of morality, however, I found myself sighing and groaning at times, and I am no prude.",1427673600,,617,4.517857142857143

PARENTAL WARNING: There is a lot of extreme violence, extreme nudity and extreme sexual violence. In my opinion this series is not for teens, even those you would normally allow to watch R rated shows. This is strictly an adult show. Adults are capable of seeing the violence as relative to the times in which it is portrayed and see it in perspective. Teens ARE children as their brains are not fully developed until their early 20's, and are easily influenced by what they see. And this show is raw and base and violent in the extreme and in my opinion it is not for teenagers, even older teenagers.",1425168000,,878,4.353658536585366

4920408,5,B0060MYM3S,"My husband and I almost missed this incredible series!  The first 2 or 3 episodes are shocking in their violence and nudity for my generation.  But our adult children encouraged us to give it another try and we're so glad we did!  It is now our favorite series among many and when it's finished, we'll buy the full set of DVDs and watch it over again without any breaks in seasons.
The quality of the production is amazing, the script, the actors ... the whole nine yards.  Yes, it's violent and yes, there is nudity (though not as prevalent as in the first few episodes) but they are not only bringing the books to the screen but are depicting an era when life WAS violent and crass.  John Wayne war movies were unrealistic and made war out to be heroic and much less tragic than it is in reality.  ""Band of Brothers"" and ""Saving Private Ryan"" gave us a taste of what war truly is and it's shocking for those of us who haven't experienced it first hand.  ""Game of Thrones"" does the same thing for medieval times.  If you want Prince Charming and chivalry, then rent a Disney movie.  They are available!  This is a look at what it must have truly been like, illustrated with rich characters and a wonderful script and plot line!",1424908800,14,1228,4.393805309734513

4920507,5,B0060MYM3S,"The second season of this astonishing epic fantasy sees the ever deepening rifts between the former kingdoms boil over into outright civil war; betrayal, duplicity and back-stabbing (both political and actual) are the order of the day. There is little by way of light relief in any of the narrative threads as the tale piles along at a break-neck pace with only the Jon Snow story arc being somewhat weak and meandering. This second season certainly lives up to the promise of the first; all of the characters from ghastly Joffrey, through treacherous Theon to the ever delightful Tyrion are developing depth as the series evolves making for an engrossing, satisfying and memorable experience. Like season one, we re-watched season two immediately - there's so much going on that a second viewing is essential to fully appreciate the complexity.

It is not possible to heap enough praise on HBO for Game of Thrones; the casting & locations are perfect while the production values and attention to detail are way beyond anything else currently on TV or in the cinema. Even the packaging is a thing of beauty. Simply marvellous.",1421452800,,1126,4.957671957671957

4920576,2,B0060MYM3S,"I'm not going to try and sell this item to you, If you're looking into this then you're probably
some what familiar with the series and what it's about. The problem with the show isn't the
quality of it. but the quality of the DVD's and BluRays themselves.

I bought my copy at the local WalMart, originally I wanted the DVD set but they were out,
so I got the BluRay copy. I can tell you now that, it doesn't make a difference really, both
sets of the series share in the same quality control issues, however, unique to Blu-Ray,
the seasonal sets tend to be overpriced. Packing in a DVD copy of the same season or
Digital Codes does not really sell the extra cost to me, but whatever.

The real issue I have with HBO's love-child is that they botched the dvd and blu-ray sets.
How? Well, seemingly at random, you'll be watching an episode and then the video will
either skip randomly, some times minutes, entire scenes, or it will kick you right out of the
episode to the menu, if not eject the disc entirely. Some times it's just one episode on a
disc, or the whole disc itself, and up to the whole boxset being bad,

I currently own every season of this show except for the newest seasons, and I've had to
return every single one of them except for the very first season multiple times in order to
get a set that worked properly through and through. For as much money as HBO has made
off this series, they should be utterly ashamed for being so cheap on production and quality
control of one of their flagship series.

But judging from the poor standards of their own company security, I can't say I'm surprised
anymore.

I highly recommend the series, it's great epic fantasy grounded mostly in reality with much
political drama, action, romance and mystery. However, I recommend you either stream it,
own it digitally, or read the books. If you go for the dvd/blu-ray sets, just know you're gonna
be gambling each time you pick one up.

Take it from me, buy this thing at a local store, because it's going to be cheaper on you in
end returning the sets to the stores than it will be to constantly ship these things back to
amazon's warehouses until you find a working set.",1419033600,,2177,4.402985074626866

I am beginning to wonder if the ""B"" in ""HBO"" stands for boobs or butts because there are some in every episode. I'd rather see love than violence any day, but there are a few scenes that combine both into one, and that is not as good as it might seem.

It's best not to be overly fond and attached to characters on the is show; they can die at any moment. And, they have.

We are about to watch episode 5. So far, the Caligula-Lite Boy King Jeffrey is becoming so evil and brittle that he is in danger of flattening into a two-dimensional character. Maybe in his case it is one-dimensional? Uni-polar rather than bi-polar. He's just evil.",1414627200,,799,4.306666666666667

The complexity of all the plotlines keeps us interested, and the acting is superb. The scenery is breath-taking and the sets are beautifully crafted.

It's hard to pick my favorite characters to hate and to love. One thing they do very well on this show is to show different aspects of the characters -- they are complex, and are not simply ""the bad guy"" or ""the good guy.""

It's amazing.  Very brutal and serious, but also a lot of fun. There are a ton of different characters, and none of them are given preferential treatment.  The evil people are genuinely evil and intelligent, not the stupid evil that always gets caught in the end and says ""I would have gotten away with it without you meddling kids!""

Don't get me wrong, it isn't the kind of show you watch on Saturdays with your kids. But if you want something realistic and brutal, with humor and emotion riddled throughout, then this is the ideal show for you.

The show hits its stride between this and the next season and keeps barrelling ahead into season 4.  Long episodes, but only 10 a season, and a lot happens in each episode.

There is a moment in this season that will make your jaw hit the floor.",1411948800,,824,4.417218543046357

Game of Thrones is rather adult, definitely not for anyone under 18! But, for older families with everyone that is 18 and older, it's a great series to converse and theorize about. Who is your favorite character? What do you think will happen? Doesn't this character just frustrate you? They are questions usually only reserved for the rare family MOVIE outing.

They are well animated and narrated by cast members (in character). They enrich the entire experience with the series and provide historical context to a show that can gloss over the details.

4920935,1,B0060MYM3S,"While this series seems promising with a brilliant cast of actors, it is unfortunately riddled with what amounts to pornography, extreme nudity, homosexuals have sex, and lesbians engaging in sex.  The plot and lines are beautifully played.  However, the series is not rated for viewing.  Therefore, if you are looking for a great series to share with friends and family, be forewarned that the nudity scenes last for several minutes and are not a passing glance.  The scenes are offensive, lasting in duration, and unacceptable for viewing.  It would have been a great series for all ages if it would have foregone the heavy amounts of nudity and soft porn.  It is a shame really because the cast is first rate actors and the scenery is excellent.  I would not recommend this series to anyone, especially people who have a higher moral character.  You can not keep up with the plot because you have to fast forward too many nudity/sex scenes.  We watched most of the first season, but as the sex scenes/nudity became worse and worse, we threw it in the trash.  We have returned the two other seasons unopened.",1405382400,2,1110,4.7643979057591626

4920991,4,B0060MYM3S,"Love the tales spun and all the characters developed all along. But, after two seasons things are getting very predictive.",1403654400,,122,5.15
4920992,5,B0060MYM3S,"I am relatively new to Game of Thrones. I've had it on my list since it debuted, but as I don't have HBO, I've been waiting. A good deal on the first season DVD set got me, and I've just watched season two via Amazon Instant Video, which has worked like a charm. It would prefer to own the physical set, but the price/logistics situation at the moment lead me to do the streaming. Again, very good service for what it is.

As far as the story content of season two, it may or may not be the equal of season one, but it certainly is not a letdown to me. Additional characters and locations are introduced into the mix, and the visual scope and scale of Game of Thrones continues to be breathtaking. It's easy to get excited and say ""this is the best ever"" but I cannot recall ever having seen something this vastly epic and richly woven outside of a movie theater.

The one thing that motivated me to write this, when there are already literally thousands of other five-star reviews, is the final scene of the final episode of this season. Absolutely...I do not even know what word to use. Extremely powerful, let's say. I was wondering if anything could top ""the reveal scene with Daenerys"" from season one. Yes, it could and it does. This season may not be completely perfect in every single way, but it's still so far beyond virtually anything else that exists in its medium that it gets the highest marks from me, here.",1403568000,3,1422,4.403041825095057
4920993,2,B0060MYM3S,"Season one was great. Fantastic, even. It contained very nearly everything one could wish for in a book to show adaption, telling the story faithfully while still offering its own unique take on certain features. And while season 2 offers some great continuation to that story, other sections miss the mark for a variety of reasons. Let's take it by region.

King's Landing remains the highlight of the show. Tyrion's tale is easily the best done and is solid all around. Yes, there are adjustments to the book, but they fit well and truly serve the story. Sansa, on the other hand, suffers. During the season we see her mope around some, and for good reason. Mostly she's just there to showcase the cruelty of Joffrey, and that's fine. But so much was cut out. Her interactions with Dontos and especially Sandor makes for much missing potential in one of the more interesting storylines within the series, and serves to poorly set up the finale between herself and Sandor which could further haunt the series down the road. Despite this, the climax to King's Landing storyline is an absolute splendor to watch, consisting of an episode-long epic battle in which it becomes difficult to decide who to root for.

Stannis and his storyline is of similar quality, but suffers poor editing. There are multiple occasions where a scene is placed strangely in order with the others, and much of the oomph is lost because of this. Premiere among in this is his inevitable climax with his brother, leaving off at a cliffhanger one episode only to resolve it somewhat anticlimactically the next when it would have been better to resolve and then witness the fallout the following episode. There's just so little flow between scenes despite how well they might be penned due entirely to the editing process.

From here let's take a look at Robb, who takes a welcome deviation from the books so we can witness some of what he is up to. The scenes are welcome and the character continues to shine, but there's other issues present. The show decides upon taking most of his time to develop his budding romance with a camp follower, all the while other plots surrounding him are dropped. Greatjon is cut from the series and while Roose and Karstark are present, we never get to see the bond he develops with his troops or his more loyal supporters while Jaime's escape attempt ends up greatly diminished and somehow even more glossed over than the brief description we received in the books. So while it's nice seeing Robb more, it largely feels like wasted potential for the sake of telling a romance.

And from here, we get to Arya. Now this story ends up a decent adaption, but it never tries to push much beyond that. It doesn't truly detract from the potential of her storyline, but following her travels with Yoren, things never come close to reaching her high in the books. Yeah, we get a small glimpse at the horror of Gregor and her budding darkness of the three kills she receives, and her interactions with Tywin are a truly interesting addition to the series. However, none of this reaches the grim hopelessness and depravity of the books, and the fantastic book climaxes end up cut entirely, leaving this all feeling more like an interesting little side adventure than a clever survival of a truly horrifying situation.

Meanwhile, across the narrow sea...Dany's storyline is hard to judge. It's not as strong as her first chapter, and weaker as well to what follows, but that's sort of how it is in the books as well. Her book tale in Clash is dreadfully dull excepting a grand finale which would not translate well to the screen. In many ways they actually improve upon this in the show, creating some intrigue where there previously was none. Could they have done better? Yes. But they also didn't want to stray too far off the rails and that seems to be much of what keeps this storyline in check. End of the day, though, despite the finale not being as interesting as in the books (largely because that'd be impossible without outright spoiling the rest of the show) Dany's tale is actually stronger here than in the books. Though some characters do exit early, the development and intrigue is much more present and interesting.

But now we go to Winterfell and here's where things begin really getting ugly. Theon tries, bless his soul, and becomes one of the great highlights of the season, but he ends up a shining point of light surrounded by filth. So much was cut down from Winterfell that there isn't much left for Bran to interact with and even those surrounding Theon just sort of end up dull and some of the changes don't end up making sense (like the ironborn's obvious and eventual betrayal when they would eventually have to face the likes of the remaining Greyjoys). Everything floats so much around how far Theon falls and kicking him while he's down that the actual intrigue to the storyline never sees the light of day, all the while the rest of the story has to run to catch up because so many characters who are supposed to be having an impact soon haven't even been introduced. That's truly bad storytelling there, when not only does what is presented not stand up, but weakens what is to come.

If Winterfell weakens future storylines, though, north of the Wall tries its damndest to destroy them. Where last we left Jon he'd gone through a rather important character arc. He'd gone from spoiled brat with dreams of glory to a brother, friend, and protector. Someone who chose duty over passion. So where do we go from here? Well, the show tells us this tale of a an inexperienced kid in over his head, slowly learning what it means to follow. He screws up every chance he gets and generally causes trouble for everyone around him unintentionally. In the end, he begins a bantering friendship/rivalry with a cute wildling woman who is a joy to watch. Ok, a little pathetic, but certainly the storyline will take us to someplace he'll very soon redeem himself a little. Unless you have actually read the storyline and know just how much this one got screwed up. See, Jon doesn't need to learn to follow in the books, he already understands that. He was told this outright in the previous story and has been following to learn to lead his entire life. He's an obedient and hard worker that is chosen for the ranging (not begs for it) due to his training, background, likely eventual position within the Watch, and, yes, his connection with his dire wolf. Here he proves an effective member of the team, always learning and using the skills he has to the betterment of the mission. Where the show bumbles him through mistakes in an attempt to jumpstart his relationship with a wildling half a season early, the books are focusing on teaching Jon the depths of duty and sacrifice, of choosing the right man for the right job and the necessity of having to send men to their deaths in order to accomplish a greater mission or even just allow the rest to survive. It is a grim tale of survival and an interesting character piece...which is entirely cut from the show so we can get quips from a wildling. And the worst part? This character the show sacrificed this storyline for is going to be around awhile. We'll still be able to get these interactions. And that story of redemption you think may be coming? It's not. There's so much time between this point and any real chance at redemption for him that his tale of incompetence here will grow cold. What does this leave then? A kind of boring story where, getting down to it, nothing of particular note happens until the end and even then what happens is mostly just setup for the next season. Really? That's it?

But then what's worse, you have all these promotions for the season and one of the highlights is the three horn blasts. Many know what's coming. We're eagerly awaiting it, eager to see what is largely glossed over in the books. The white walkers arrive. Season over. What? WHAT? All this season you're promoting this singular event only to leave it basically where the promotions left off and give us a cliffhanger? WHAT??? The books went into more detail about this fantastic battle and all we got from those is flashbacks from a guy who was cowering and didn't even participate. It's pathetic. You have this storyline that accomplishes nothing all season long and then, just when it's about to go somewhere, you cut out. Who wrote these sections this season? Who approved of it? This entire storyline wasn't just dull, it screws the story to come.

In the end this season was enjoyable, but there are just far too many problems with it. Some parts are dull when they shouldn't be, others held back too much, and far too many important storylines are going to be running to catch up because of how weakly they were developed this season, often not even due to lack of time or budget restrictions due to casting or effects, but because they ended up focusing time away on scenes which don't serve purpose or otherwise go nowhere. In its own right the season probably deserves three stars, but when I see what could have been and how much it will screw things up for multiple seasons down the road, I think it's lucky to earn two.",1403568000,,9214,4.640931372549019

1. The actual TV Shows are available only in DVD format and not blu-ray, at least, not in this selection. The blu-ray discs are additional material (loads of them) that are equally fascinating.
2. The Digital Copy DOES NOT work in many countries, including India, so it is actually a waste to procure one with a Digital Copy, that is till such archaic rules are removed by broadcasting companies. So legally you CANNOT download the Digital Copy if you reside outside of the US and a very few countries of Europe.
3. When I made this point with Amazon Customer Care that Amazon knew the contents and also the fact that I was shipping to India so they could very well have not shipped this collection with the Digital Copy. Amazon Customer Care agreed to make a partial refund of the total cost back to my credit card.

Only reason we ordered it was because my husband really liked the first book, but does not make time to read like I do. It does allow us to converse about the differences between the books and the series. Anyone just watching this and not reading the books is really missing out.",1399939200,,424,4.108433734939759

4921062,5,B0060MYM3S,"I was prepared to dislike this because I am not into fantasy, probably why I never read the books. However I was amazed at how it grabs you jerks you into the story. At times funny, at times very brutal and violent, and at other times shocking. I would not recommend this for children under 13, especially so for sensitive children. Seems to want to go over the top at times just for the sake of doing so. Almost to the point where I deduct stars",1399852800,,446,4.1976744186046515

4921067,5,B0060MYM3S,"If you like sex and violence, you will love this show.  Do not rent if you are offended by nudity.  Although nudity is not the main focus, there is plenty of it in the first couple of seasons.

I enjoy this show because it is well written.  I do not typically like the ""fantasy"" genre and this has some of that, but not too much.  I enjoy good story lines and well crafted scenarios with the occasional plot twist.  This has all of that and more.

If you liked The Tudors you will probably like this.",1399680000,,500,4.145833333333333

4921075,5,B0060MYM3S,"I purchased ""Game of Thrones"" - Season 2 recently.  The writing is excellent and the variety of characters keep you guessing what is going to happen next.  It is interesting how they killed off one main character (Ned StarK) to make way for some new ones in Season 2.  I don't subcribe to HBO, so I decided it was cheaper to buy the series from Amazon.  Anyway, I think ""Game of Thrones"" is quality entertainment and worth the purchase.",1399334400,,436,4.481012658227848

4921077,4,B0060MYM3S,Second season story line still has its twists and turns.  After season 1 I am finally following the three story lines in this series and the characters are more interesting as the story evolves.  There are several surprises.  The nude and sex scenes which have nothing to do with character development have become less frequent in Season 2.,1399334400,,340,4.827586206896552

4921081,3,B0060MYM3S,"""World is built by killers"" revelation by a fighter called Mad Dog underlies this Second Season incorporating superficial in mere self-important majesties' wars of intrigues and arrogance, run at a very expense of their subjects as usual.

A bit lesser of eroticism screened, this season parades more cynic brutality of the rulers and, to a reviewer's opinion, regrettably slides on a path of clichs and illogical occurrences while, for instanvce, killing the only one top feudal inclined into arts because he was a homosexual, but sparing a sadistic supreme sovereign teen Jeffry from a ghost-murderer for, probably, continuing this Game. Some characters had been appeared miraculously after being surely destroyed by demons etc.

4921088,4,B0060MYM3S,"I read the series from R.R. Martin before watching the series and unfortunately I know it strays from the book at times.  I also think it moves too fast, but these books have to be condensed down.  The only character I do not like that strays from the original is Margery Tyrell.  She seems a little too old and sexed up, from the book version.  Loras is not as good-looking as described in the book, he is the Knight of flowers and the descriptive is what is left out.  Also the scene when Rob Stark meets his soon to be bride in the battle field, that never happened in the book, but I am seeing it happen too often.  HBO had to tighten the script to keep people interested in TV series.  My likes are of course Danny's storyline, and Melissandre is better than expected, I pictured Stannis to be a lot older than the TV series version, however.  The direwolves are a bit CGI'd too much, but everything else from the set looks awesome! I would recommend.",1398988800,,956,4.331460674157303

The show's producers stay fairly true to the original story and manage to keep most of the best storylines and themes intact.

If you haven't seen season 1 yet, I highly recommend watching that first!  This is not a show you can jump in the middle of.  There are so many characters and so many intertwining storylines that you will be lost instantly.  Even the first season is difficult to follow with so many things happening at once.",1397520000,,596,4.324324324324325

4921140,5,B0060MYM3S,"this show gets better all the time.  If you are a fan of the books, however, you will start to see some deviation from the plot in season two.  it's not that they change a bunch of things as much as they rearrange things chronologically and so some of the stuff that is in book three is in season two and some of the stuff that is in book two comes out in season three.

A few changes of characters aren't really that off-putting if you've read the books.  In fact in almost every case where the book and the tv show don't meet, I like the changes the show has made better.  Season one read like word for word almost from the book.  Season two, not so much.

if you bought season one, buy this one too.  If you're just getting into the show now because you're hearing all your friends rave about it, yes you need to buy the DVDs so you can catch up.  It's that good.

Again, there's a bunch of fun features in the set as well as the ten episodes.  Five discs means each disc has two episodes and some features.  That means I haven't gotten to watch all the features yet.  I'm like a kid with a big box of candy.... I'm allowing myself a little here and a little there to reward myself for good work done etc.

Got the leaves raked up?  GoT.
Pulled up some weeds?  GoT.
caught up with reading?  GoT.
Vacuumed the house?  GoT.

The DVD quality is again top notch and the packaging is great.  I'm more than pleased.  Already have season three as well and will be reviewing that next.....",1397347200,,1484,4.154929577464789

Pretty terrific stuff.",1397001600,,328,4.655172413793103

The acting is top notch especially Peter Dinklage as Tyrion this year.

My friends were asking me, have you started watching Game of Thrones yet?, and I told them it sounded ridiculous and a waste of time to watch, I was HORRIBLY WRONG.  I bought the first episode of Season 1 by itself, thinking I would not waste too much money at $2.99, I was a little disturbed by the ""soft Porn"" going on, but I am just a shy person with on screen sex, so about half way through the episode I decided that I would finish this and be done with it, at the end of Episode 1, I mean the very end, I could not buy the second one fast enough, in fact I bought the whole first season!  Once I finished that season I immediately bought season 2, which is where I am now, I have to stay out of conversations with my friends who are waiting with bated breath for Season 4 as not to have them spoil anything for me, I even bought the books for my Kindle......Yes I am Obsessed....lots of things in it still disturb me, the killing of the animals, the full on sex and the amount of blood but if I were to be able to go back to the time of Kings and Knights..........I would think it would be similar to Game of Thrones.....One could dream I guess.",1395964800,2,1184,4.072961373390558

4921194,5,B0060MYM3S,"Striking a near-perfect balance between grit and sensationalism, it takes viewers through a world marked by violence, double-dealing, and racial division, with an emphasis on the ambiguous morality and personal and familial baggage that come with a life lived between the straight world and the criminal one. The machinations of the characters and the twists of the plot are almost operatic, but the show remains rooted in the harsh realities of gangland.

4921209,5,B0060MYM3S,"One of the things I love most about HBOs adaptation is how despite the fact that I read the second book, I was still surprised about major plot turns. It seemed to me that the show strayed quite a bit from the book and yet it was still riveting and entertaining and somehow true to the original.

Major deviations:

Danaerys  The shows changes in her storyline were the most effective since there was very little suspense in the book, where she was essentially trying to get someone, anyone to sponsor her trip to Westeros. The show changed all that and made her story richer and all the more dramatic.

Arya and Tywin Lannister  In the book they never meet yet in the show Tywin Lannister somehow sees through her gender disguise and what more chooses her as his cupbearer. He is perceptive enough on that score and on the fact that shes a Northerner yet doesnt seem as suspicious as he ought to about her true identity. However, Tywin and Aryas scenes are noteworthy in that you can see Aryas begrudging admiration of him fighting against her wish to kill him. The show also makes a more realistic scenario of how/why she doesnt name him right off the bat as someone she wants killed.

Brienne and Jaime Lannister  Im not sure if this is going to be in a subsequent book or the show just completely changed everything but Catelyn Stark letting Jaime free herself was an eyeopener. The actress they cast was perfect!

Robb & his lady  Again, I don't know if this is going to be in a later book but I guess the young wolf should get a little play time for all his warring. Interesting development.

Jon Snow & Egrid  The book hinted at something that might develop later but the show really fleshed out a more prolonged interaction which leads me to believe these two will be tangling really soon.

Can I say how much I love that last scene of the last episode??!!! Amazing. Winter is coming shivers.",1395446400,2,1900,4.491279069767442
4921210,5,B0060MYM3S,Fan of the books but much bigger fan of the show.  So wonderfully realised and executed. Will be a lifelong favorite.,1395446400,,117,4.571428571428571

You will not be able to stop yourself from watching it once you start.  Beware, though, that some scenes are hauntingly disturbing but still reveal and portray the reality of the situation and the true essence of the characters.  You will want to grow attached to certain characters, but stop yourself from doing so to save yourself the trouble; the book and television series is in it's simplicity, a war story.  Therefore, plenty of death occurs.  Beyond that disappointment, the culmination of several kingdoms fighting for dominance and/or independence and freedom results in a wonderfully entertaining story.",1395360000,,753,5.181818181818182

The only reason I didn't give the TV series 5 stars is because I don't understand why HBO has to be so explicit with the sex scenes.  The books certainly aren't.  It seems very gratuitous and is absolutely unnecessary to drive the story.

First we see a knight, under the control of a boy with severe narcissism who orders him to topple his opponent over a wall. He falls about 30 feet with a sickening thud into a pool of his own blood. That is on par with the middle ages, but then a child emerges from the shadows to clean up the mess. What? Is that even legal on a movie set?? Where is the social worker?? Next we try to drown a drunk with a barrel of wine, visit a man who makes babies with his daughters and proceed on to stabbing a baby in a whore house.

The boy, who plays him is a great young actor & I'm sure he will act for years to come. The young Stark sister who is a tomboy does a great job and the imp-the little person.

My only quibble is what they left out from the books. I realize that unless they want the series to be 300 hours long things have to be cut  but some of the things they cut either make certain later things seem improbable or they lessen the impact of those things. I.e. tthe changes they made to when Arya, Hot Pie and the blacksmith kid get captured, the circumstances of their capture in the bookl make their impending torture make sense. Different circumstances in the show make the torture and questions about The Brotherhood merely confusing.

Bit that's a minor quibble. I would only have docked it half a star for that if Amazon let me, Otherwise, it is an awesome series and I would recommend it to anyone, fantasy fan or not.",1391817600,,947,4.46242774566474

I first got hooked watching this on a free HBO weekend and remember seeing some of the last episode of this season first before I bought the books and Blu-ray set of Season 1 and binge-watched it to catch up. Needless to say, I'm hooked for better or worse. While I didn't really care for Robb Stark's love story and was disappointed to have another actor playing The Mountain That Rides, the rest of this season was extremely good and enjoyed it more than the book I was reading at the same time - stalled halfway through reading A Clash of Kings but I'll catch up hopefully. Margaery Tyrell and Melisandre were awesome new additions to the show, as was Ygritte and even Brienne of Tarth. Just hoping my favorite characters live through The Red Wedding episode I've tried to avoid hearing about for so long. Good special features and I also like this set because it has DVD and digital copies, unlike the Season 1 set that I bought.",1391472000,,1006,4.502732240437158

A personal attachment to characters occurs almost immediately. With that being said. There is a real repulsive nature to this film. The moral values of this program are seedy and therefore not  advised for public viewing. Especially not families.  This could have been an all time series or an all time keeper in family libraries Like "" Eragon"" or ""Pirates of the Carribean"" . HBO should wake up!!!! They get more viewers when we can refer a movie on its merit not the number of immoralities and poor language it contains.  FYI more viewers with values= more money. It seems to me defunct moral viewers probably know this show is being pirated and don't pay for it anyway.

I looked the problem up and it seems it might be a region code problem? Meaning this is possibly not made for region one. I put it in my dvd player and it worked fine until it started skipping through scenes. Some of the disks have scratches and I was going to refund it for a replacement, but after reading the other reviews it's not worth it.

It will transform cool dudes and women into empathetic nerds. Some things just know how to transcend time and nerdery. God bless Star Wars as one, LOTR another, and this is the most recent savior of this generation.

How can I say it's nerdery? Just look up any character or character in the show on Facebook. they all have facebook fan pages with thousands of fans. I personally am a fan of the House of Tyrell (because the admin obviously has the best humor of the fan pages).

SPOILER ALERT: While searching for your favorite fan pages to like on FB, you WILL find uber nerds talking about future plotlines based on the book. this will spoil Season 4 for you and beyond.

4921402,5,B0060MYM3S,"I bought this on the strength of the first season. If anyone is expecting it to be like the first one, let that assumption go. It's not. It's s-l-o-w-e-r. I think a couple of days, or maybe weeks, passes during the entire season. Not much forward movement at all, but plenty of shocks and surprises.

The focus is not on the same characters. It couldn't really be because many of the main characters in the first one were killed. This adds some interest, but sort of takes you on a whole different journey too. The characters change. Some, like Tyrion, seem to evolve with the changing events. Some, like Catlyn, make inexplicable decisions that are completely out of character. The new characters are, in many cases, odd additions. It feels a bit Twilight Zonish. (Just a tiny gripe- why did they cast Natalie Dorman? She's so Anne Bolyn in EVERYTHING. Blech).

There is a lot going on. At times I thought the story jumped the shark as the fantasy elements are a bigger part of things now. Not sure I like that part. Dragons and White Walkers are fine, but it's gone off the deep end now. Still there are LOTS of brutal surprises that keep me watching. Just when I think, ""eh, it's time to turn this off"" something unpredictable and quite compelling happens. So, yes, it's a keeper.

Just one more (odd) note. One of the things I found most intriguing is the way that this series does death. In most movies, they slow things way down. Fight scenes last minutes. There can be dialog about revenge, hate, or whatever before foes kill each other. Not so here. It's more realistic. It's ""slash, die"" with no fan fare. Life goes on around you and that's that. It's shocking, and far more realistic.",1390780800,2,1694,4.565789473684211
4921403,2,B0060MYM3S,"Doesn't help that Clash of Kings, which is my least favorite book of the series, is used as a basis for season two and that they really went into another direction with and it was not that loyal to the books either.

Prime example:
No Reek/Ramsay Snow at all this season. A key part from Theon's story and it was completely axed from the show. It's a shame too because Ramsay is a character you'll love to hate and most people do in season 3. And then we have Roose Bolton. He was the one that went to Harrenhal and should have been the one having interactions with Arya, Not Tywin.

The Boltons are key players in the series in book 3 and on and yet they barely get seen/heard from in this season. I think if they had used this season to build them up, Their impact in season 3 would have been a lot more powerful.

I understand that budget problems and things of that nature can effect things but when it's about essential characters, I just can't stand it. That is why I did not care much for this season.",1390780800,,1008,4.212435233160622

4921437,5,B0060MYM3S,"I love this series! It's very engaging and I love that it's unpredictable. No one is safe. As they say, ""When you play the game of thrones you win or you die. There is no middle ground.""

Definitely worth watching!",1389657600,,214,4.35
4921438,5,B0060MYM3S,"Ranks with Lonesome Dove, Band of Brothers and The Tudors as the very best mini-series ever. The acting, story line, writing and inherent drama is absolutely superb. I can't wait for season three to come out in February. ( I have only seen season one and two).
As I mentioned earlier, it is as good as the other three, and that is saying something!
These types of productions are so well done, so very,very good that if they were cinamatic films, they would indeed be firmly entrenched in the Pantheon of entertainment greatness!
As it is, the aformentioned shows are among the precious few finest the industry has given us.",1389657600,,624,4.681818181818182
4921439,5,B0060MYM3S,"Season two was very good.  Each character was well developed and rounded out in this season.  You find yourself liking the bad characters as much as the good because they allowed the actors to show the human dilemmas of why each made the choice they did, you had empathy for them.  Then you saw the results of those decisions.

Season one was flat compared to Two. You had the evil Lannisters and the good Starks. Season was good but Two was excellent.

Then the sets, costumes, etc was the most elaborate and best I have ever seen. Real beats CG every time!",1389657600,,558,4.431372549019608

There are so many details you don't pick up the first time around when watching it on tv. I especially enjoy the commentaries from the producers and actors that the DVD collection has. A fan can learn lots of extra interesting facts about the story line and actors. I would recommend it to anyone who has an interest in the middle ages and fantasy.",1389571200,,469,4.7317073170731705

4921451,5,B0060MYM3S,I wasn't too sure how this complex set of story lines with many major and minor characters would work as a series. I was pleased to see that the story lines were followed and were not shorted. If that had happened it would have made a confusing mess of it. They did a good job and I enjoyed it very much.,1389484800,,304,4.0
4921452,5,B0060MYM3S,"a really well done series. I enjoy it very much.there are many things moving along and the parallel paths are done in a manner that keeps everything moving along. Life in an era such as this would be a bit harsh,not like a well-groomed lawn.",1389484800,,241,4.377777777777778
4921453,5,B0060MYM3S,"The story line continued, true to the book series.  The most compelling characters remain Tyrian, Arya, Jon Snow and Daenerys;  the most irritating, Joffrey Lannister and Lord Baelysh.  The most complicated characters are  Robb Stark, Cerci Lannister and Jorah Mormont.

I look forward to the Complete Third Season, and its successors.  I understand that the Fourth Season will contain elements of Books 3, 4 and 5.  This should make for an interesting blend.",1389484800,,459,5.205479452054795

I was really surprised how large these books were, it took me a moment to understand his writing. I wouldn't have bothered, but everything I read stated that you need to read the books first. I give it 4 stars due to the good plot, but there is so much gore & nudity. I'm okay with the nudity, but the core can be overwhelming.",1389052800,,449,4.294117647058823

I consistently get 50mb download speeds and have no trouble streaming off of Netflix or Hulu in HD.  Streaming off of Amazon, on the other hand, was like watching an etch a sketch.  Don't get me wrong I love the etch a sketch...it requires manual dexterity and a great imagination.  However I did not want to play etch a sketch, I wanted to watch GOT.  So either buy the BluRay or buy an etch a sketch, but for the love of God don't try and stream it.",1389052800,,555,4.219047619047619

4921481,5,B0060MYM3S,"I saw a few episodes of Game of Thrones from hotel rooms while traveling and - to be honest - it looked a little bit hokey to me.  But, on the recommendation of a friend, I started watching the series from the beginning and am addicted to it!  There is an excellent, though at times complex, storyline.

The only downside is that the violence and sexual content borders on being gratuitous.  The story wouldn't be hurt by removing that content at all.  For that reason, I wouldn't recommend it as something for a younger audience.",1388880000,,530,4.536842105263158
4921482,5,B0060MYM3S,"I have been a fan of Game of Thrones for quite a while, watching bits and pieces here and there. For Christmas I finally decided to buy season 1 and 2 to watch it in succession. I have really enjoyed it.

First, lets get the obvious out of the way. This is a HBO series, so with it comes an enormous amount of sex, nudity, and gore. It is certainly not a show for young adults. That being said, if these types of scenes make you uncomfortable I would encourage you to try to see past it to the actual plot of the story. I promise, you won't be disappointed. This story began as a set of books, a series that has yet to be finished, and though I have not read the books yet I look forward to the opportunity. The world that you will find yourself a part of is actually several intricate stories that are connected by various characters and plot motivations. It is exciting, emotionally charged, and surprising at every turn.

The movie magic itself is amazing as well. The sets and locations are all absolutely beautiful and very authentic (for a fantasy) in my opinion. You can tell that a great deal of vision and work went into every detail. The costumes are all well made and beautiful as well. Finally, the special effects are wonderful. From the dragons, to the whitewalkers, to the make up, it does not disappoint.

Finally, the actors in this production are phenomenal. They make the characters believable and make the viewer invest in them throughout their story. The fact many are absolutely gorgeous doesn't hurt anything either.

I have greatly enjoyed GoT so far and I am so looking forward to continuing on with the story. I hope readers have found my review helpful and enjoy the series as much as I have.",1388880000,3,1719,4.464968152866242

I can't imagine why I'd want to pay for these seasons, and especially for the price quoted. The show is action packed, but I did begin to feel like it was an overload of sex and perversity, when it didn't move the storyline at all. By the end of season 3 most of the great characters have been killed off, leaving us with the creepy ones and the ones who are too young to do much about it all.",1388707200,,491,4.168421052631579

If you have read the books, you undestand it would be impossible to follow it exactly and still keep it in ten episodes.  Even with straying from the book, it is still an excellent series and I can't wait to see season three.  My only complaint was that the story changes short changed Tyrion, who is one of my favorite characters.  Whether you have read the books or not, I highly recommend this HBO series!

4921510,3,B0060MYM3S,"The story is interesting enough where you keep watching...yet you skip most of the episode just to get to it. There is so much porn in the show its ridiculous, it detracts so much from it. I've never been one to say this but I was hoping some regular cable network would show it like tbs and cut all of the crap out. Its so out of place feeling, its like this book i read once it was literately two separate authors, there was the actual author who wrote this wonderful tale and the book editor that added material to turn it into a trashy romance novel for women. And you knew immediately when the editor took over because the voice was completely different and because they used modern slang and language in a 16 century period piece novel. There are times nudity may make sense, like when  khaleesi steps from the fire unburned, of course all her clothing would. But HBO has this idea to turn every show into soft core porn frankly to get the male viewers in the target group of 18 to 34 to watch. I have had many of my friends say they find it weird and confusing to them, and completely out of place alot of times. And a few saying if they wanted to watch porn they would watch porn but they don't want to watch game of thrones for porn. They watch it because they like the story lines and many have read the books. And I know some people are disappointed with it feeling like the bad guy always wins but its because its not the good guy wining all the time which is what they are use to. George R.R. Martin was in my opinion saying look in real life bad s*** happens..you could have the most bad ass person who can still die suddenly..and it's predictable to have this main character the series is based on that somehow manages to live through all of these things happening to them...but it isn't realistic...And honestly is speaks of the periods in time such as the medieval times of europe where it was dangerous to be in a position in the monarchy cause your whole family could get wiped out for that reason or you could die of starvation if you weren't...it was a harsh world and so is the game of thrones world...",1388188800,,2124,4.2835820895522385

The sex scenes are rather graphic and we found ourselves skipping a bunch of episode one and going on to episode 2 only to find that it doesn't get any better.  HBO has packaged together violence, sex, and foul language in such a way that the parts add up to a much more vulgar whole than they would be on their own.

I love it. My favorite tv shows of all time are, in order, The Sopranos, The Wire, Breaking Bad, Six Feet Under, Justified, Mad Men. I never though that any show would ever approach The Sopranos for pure viewing pleasure and blanket quality. GOT comes close. Very close. Now for the picture quality. From the first frame to the last is a reference blu ray. If you doubt me just go check out the reviews at bluraycom and highdefdigest. HBO has delivered the highest quality picture ever seen on a television show (or movie for that matter),  by carefully spreading out ten episodes on five discs. The results are spectacular.

Apparently, HBO went bottom of the barrel because through the first pass through seasons 1 & 2, the DVDs started to skip and scratch. I am very careful with my boxed sets so it has to be the materials. I am not longer watching them now. The packaging itself is low quality as well.

This award winning TV series is absolutely superb!  I am so impressed with the excellent acting, the strong, detailed character development, the gorgeous cinematography, the stunning set designs, and the unexpected twists and turns of the passionate story line.

This is as high quality as television gets, and HBO has spared no expense in order to deliver one of the finest series ever produced. This is simply a modern mid-evil masterpiece of a show.

I LOVED Season One, and Season Two continues to deliver excellence and thrilling entertainment after the shocking and intense events of the first season. If you have not watched this series, you MUST START RIGHT NOW!  I cannot wait to see the next season -  waiting for my delivery of Season Three now! Yaaaay!!! A truly beautiful series to own and treasure.",1384646400,,950,4.863354037267081

I have not read the books, but the series does provide some entertainment value. I find the constant tension between clans to gain power a bit boring and a little predictable, though I would not mind seeing Cersei Lannister thrown off the castle peak, her character I find a bit despicable and hateful.",1384646400,,479,4.454545454545454
4921586,5,B0060MYM3S,"Excellent series from excellent books.  Warning:  these are not for the faint-of-heart!

4921587,4,B0060MYM3S,"The quality of the Blu-ray is top notch.  I have no issue there.  The only gripe I have is with the menu system.  You cannot select by chapter or scene.  Almost every Blu-ray disc I have ever purchased has this feature.  Why would they choose to exclude it in this wonderful series.  I would rather have fewer interviews and such just to have had that feature included.  Having said that, would I buy this set again?  You bet!  Unless, of course, someone else came out with a better Blu-ray set that included the chapter select menu.",1384387200,,533,4.46875
4921588,3,B0060MYM3S,"First, I am watching the entire series so it has held my interest.  I read all of the books and both the first and second season seem to follow the books fairly closely.  The characters are well acted and the costumes and sets are lovely.  Because I read the books I have no trouble following the story but I wonder if someone just watching the videos would be able to follow the myriad of characters, plots and subplots involved.  My lower rating reflects what I perceive as unnecessary  carnage, nudity, and graphic sexual content which is visualized excessively throughout the episodes.  The story stands well on its own and the viewer can get the idea of the violent aspects of the plot without actually seeing the heads chopped off or the graphic sexual scenes - added I believe for shock value.",1384387200,2,800,4.638297872340425

I thought Breaking Bad was the most amazing show I had ever seen on TV, but then G.O.T. Came along. Now don't get me wrong Breaking Bad is still my fav show of all time but that's only because G.O.T. Hasn't ended yet 4 me 2 make a decision on which 1 I prefer, but so far I put it up there with B.B.

4921668,5,B0060MYM3S,"Season Two continues the excellent standard of entertainment set in Season One. I haven't read the book this series is based on, so all of the content was new to me. The story continues the efforts of Rob Stark to avenge the execution of his father, the journey of Jon Snow as a man of the Watch, the adventures of their two sisters, the Dragon Queen's trials and, in my opinion the most interesting of all, the development of the Lannister family runt, the dwarf, played superbly by Peter Dinklage. There are also several other new key sub-stories. The power of this series is in the extensive cast and this allows a lot of scope for killing characters off. This continues in Season Two but is offset by the inclusion of many new interesting characters. It all allows for the whole gamut the human condition to be explored. People make poor decisions and risk horrific consequences. There are battles, murders and betrayals. Alliances shift and new players emerge to replace those who fail. There is also a more notable shift to matters supernatural. Note that sex and language continue to be very strong but to me it is all riveting stuff. Some scenes are simply jaw dropping and more big developments are promised in Season Three!",1380672000,3,1233,4.712962962962963

The game of thrones has what every good television show should have, a very well written plot, well performed characters, and no expenses spared in creating the perfect and thrilling visual effect.

But what makes the game of thrones so distinctive from other boring and repetitive and predictable power play television shows, is none of the characters are stupid, they each posses their own individual intellects and even pitfalls. It is exciting to see which character would end up surviving the entire ordeal.

many different Kingdoms , with to many different characters in each Kingdom to to follow . There is to many different plots

after a while you become so confused as to who is who & which kingdom they are from . I didn't wipe it out completely

Wonderful boxset with a beautiful map. I really enjoyed all the commentaries, the director and writers especially since they talk about the process of the series, and little facts you probably wouldn't catch elsewhere. The opening menus for the discs are great, and not too annoying to navigate through with a keyboard (which is a plus lol).

The only lacking part was that the HBO digital files were only available through itunes, and they were HUGE. I was excited for this so I could throw these on my smartphone to watch on the bus or while traveling, but some of the files being 1-4Gigs each, meant that will never happen. There was also no way to remove the 'special features' from these files (probably why they were so huge), which is unfortunate, since I'll watch the blurays for them....not so important while watching on the run.",1379203200,,870,4.76158940397351

4921744,5,B0060MYM3S,"So interesting and intriguing.

The book is very good and more detailed in regards to why which war started, and where which character comes from, but the series do a lot of justice. High quality, good actors.

Can't wait for the 4th season as it promises to be epic!",1378425600,,267,4.428571428571429

Still waiting on Season 3 to be sent to me! :)",1378425600,,296,4.60377358490566
4921746,5,B0060MYM3S,"Beware the kind of addiction that this series will inflict on you. I was hooked after the first season, but Season Two picks up the pace even more. Now fully conversant with the backgrounds, bloodlines and aspirations of each of the primary families, the second season shows how the hopes and plans of each one to rule the seven kingdoms are progressively dashed and frustrated.
All it has done is to make me even more eager to see Season Three!  Bring it on!",1378425600,,459,4.530120481927711

4921748,5,B0060MYM3S,"While the second season is not quite as good as the first, it is story telling at it's best.  There is more deviation from the books during the second season, but in almost every case it aided the story and, actually, improved it from the book.  Highly recommend it.  Will be buying the third season as soon as it becomes available.",1378339200,,332,4.409836065573771

4921752,5,B0060MYM3S,Great show. We own all the seasons and love the fact that the writer shows no mercy to the characters. Any of them can die at any time! Keeps you wanting more!,1378252800,,159,4.0
4921753,3,B0060MYM3S,This season will probably irritate you. HBO took several liberities with it and added in stuff that isn't even in the books.,1378252800,,124,4.681818181818182

4921767,5,B0060MYM3S,"Great story and characters. A little too violent for me, but we can skip over some of it.  Reading the books while watching series. Books are addicting.",1377734400,,152,4.62962962962963
4921768,4,B0060MYM3S,"I like the story overall and a few of the characters, but it's a shame where the series is headed.  The first season was perfect, but this one starts to bring things into the series that weren't as prevalent before, which seems like just bad writing on George R. R. Martin's end.  Knowing what happens in the third season, I know it only gets worse from here.  Hopefully the fourth season and beyond are a lot better and make more sense.  For HBO to continue making great money off of this show, Martin really needs to stop killing off primary characters for little to no reason.",1377734400,,579,4.433962264150943
4921769,5,B0060MYM3S,Comes in a very nice box set.  How could you not like it?  I think that this one of the best television series ever produced.,1377648000,,125,3.96

4921771,5,B0060MYM3S,"This season is even better than season 1. The number of subplots has increased due to the war being fought on multiple fronts and the separation of the Stark family members, etc.; but the subplots all cohere nicely and relate to each other perfectly. I suspect even the Night watch foray behind the wall will eventually marry up with the main plot as the threads converge in season 3. My only complaint is that there is a nude scene of some sort every episode, sometimes 2. They are integral to the story lines, but I believe they (the writers) could forgo the nudity and still make their plot developments work.",1377561600,,612,4.572727272727272
4921772,5,B0060MYM3S,"We were just going to watch one DVD/week, but ended up watching all episodes in less than one week.  I watched series 1 & 2 before reading the books and in my opinion they're equally engaging and I wouldn't characterize one medium being better than the other, except for my bias towards books.  I usually read a book prior to watching a movie and 98% of the time think the book is much better than the film version.  However, between the series and the novels, I think both are power houses, well worth either watching, reading or both!",1377561600,,536,4.448979591836735

4921774,5,B0060MYM3S,"I love Game of Thrones, both the books and the series. My only complaint is that after season 1, the show doesn't follow the books as accurately. Still, it keeps me on the edge of my seat, and I love the characters. Great series!",1377561600,,229,4.2272727272727275
4921775,4,B0060MYM3S,"Was really looking forward to catching up with this season. I was very surprised to find out it came with DVDs and digital copies as well. The first season at the time did not. I was able to redeem the digital copies on iTunes with no problem, but the codes will eventually expire so if you're reading this in 2015, the codes might not work.

One of the best production quality for Blu Ray I've seen. Only a couple of episodes per disk, but they really stand out. I've seen some bad productions in moves and TV shows on blu ray before and I'm glad to see this wasn't the case. Sound is amazing too and really pop in 7.1.",1377561600,,620,4.166666666666667

4921778,5,B0060MYM3S,"I absolutely love this tv series. I am reading the books as well, and they are staying pretty true to them. Although, there are some things that I wish they would have included and some that I wish they hadn't included. The price per each episode isn't too bad, either. I only bought the first episode of this season and watched the others a different way. The quality of the episode I bought is better than the other ones that I already had!",1377561600,,442,4.337349397590361
4921779,5,B0060MYM3S,In Season 2 they expand out and we get to meet new people groups and characters. Justice is swift with beheadings happening without a trial. Love the characters and the costumes are great! Kaleesie is so beautiful and grows into a strong and courageous woman this season. Can't wait for it to start again!,1377475200,,305,4.666666666666667

4921782,5,B0060MYM3S,"It's Game of Thrones.  That's all you need to know but I'll tell you more.  While I have not read the books, I have heard from others that the HBO series follows the books exactly.  In fact it's easier to follow the series rather than the books.  Quite possibly the best show I've ever seen.  If you like a good story and you're not easily offended, you will like this series.

Warning: Lots of nudity, graphic violence, and sex.",1377388800,,429,4.367088607594937

4921789,5,B0060MYM3S,"I absolutely love game of thrones.  After watching a few episodes of the first season I was hooked.  Sadly at the time I had to travel overseas before I could finish the first season.  So I cheated and actually got all the ebooks and read them while I was gone working for a few months.  I actually have read all of them up to the last that George Martin finished which is A Dance With Dragons I believe.  It's been a while.

Anyway if you are a fan of mid evil style action and the usual HBO high drama then this is a show for you.  I have yet to meet anyone that has not liked it.  I will admit the television show strays slightly from the books but not in a bad way at all.  For the most part the story line stays intact according to the books.  So far anyway....

Great show watch it.",1377129600,,788,3.9871794871794872

4921799,4,B0060MYM3S,"Good action and intrigue. Season two continues with many rich and morally ambiguous characters. Just as soon as you are ready to loath a character they reveal a redeeming trait or explanatory event.

Season two features more graphic and gratuitous sex depicted the way a teenage boy would fantasize it. The scenes of male initiation and domination seem plausible. The female initiated scenes and participation seem obviously written by mendont wring true. The authors should have either introduced a woman into their team or at least read Masters and Johnson and the Hite Report.

Season one did not require much belief in the supernatural  dragons, magic and mystical powers. Season two makes that element pivotal. I didn't see that as an improvement.

Delivery via Amazon streaming video was mixed. One episode in non HD was so bad that I purchased the next episode in HDpossible more frustrating. I would recommend downloading and watching non-streaming.

All that said I will proceed to season three.",1376956800,,1004,5.134969325153374

4921808,2,B0060MYM3S,"The first season was pretty good. There were some changes from the book, but the story still flowed. Season two is just getting on my nerves! The changes made are absolutely ridiculous. The Jon Snow and Ygritte scenario made me stop watching and I'm not sure if I can continue. I sorta wish I didn't read the books because then maybe I would enjoy this series more.

The actor and character of Theon's sister is atrocious. The story of Daenerys is horrible. The battle between the Kings guard and the Black recruits was way underplayed, and the flow of Arya's journey was cut and changed way too much. I could go on and on. I know I should expect changes, but this was written and directed as if both writer and director did not read and love the books. And I truly don't understand how the ratings are high from people who did read the books.

Well, finished watching, finally. I'm totally disgusted. I just have no words to say how bad it is. A bitter disappointment. There is no magic whatsoever, like there is in the book. None.",1376784000,,1032,4.455026455026455

4921827,5,B0060MYM3S,"After such an astounding first season it's no small accomplishment that this second season is just as good. New characters are added, but thankfully at a pace which is managable. This is a massive story that's growing all the time and yet it's surprisingly easy to follow. The episodes individually as well as the season as a whole are expertly paced in how they jumps between locations and characters.

It's great video and audio quality with a very nice bundle of extras, including some very informative commentaries and trivia information about any given episode.

The only thing is that it ends on a bit of an off note. The final episode feels more like it is setting up the next season than putting any kind of a button the season that's just past. It's not a bad episode, but it's a bit of a soft note to end on, especially after the spectacular ""Blackwater"" which preceeded it.",1376265600,,884,4.624203821656051

4921830,5,B0060MYM3S,"I was going to hate this show. Surprisingly, I can't get enough of it. It always seems to end, right when you want it to continue. A finely detailed show. The characters are complex, and seems to amaze you with a new emotions, each episode. From the brat King Joffrey, to the tearful cry of Arya Stark tale.

Each character has their own path to follow, although, it hard to remember who is who, and who is related to whom, and who killed whom, and why. I have to watch season 1&2 again.
The graphics are amazing, and the detailed writing, whoa what such amazing details.

Also, very nice to see Carice van Houten, what such a beauty.

My only dislike with the series is that there have been so many films with a similar plot, ideas etc, its really nothing different.
Its like every idea in fantasy, horror, drama is mixed up into one series. Additionally, sometimes its hard to understand the dialogue, ends up sounding like a lot of mumbling.

Yet, the acting is so compelling that you grow to love the show just for what it is, and want to see how the story will unfold.",1376179200,,1073,4.376884422110553

4921853,5,B0060MYM3S,"This is a television show? That's the thought that keeps bouncing in my head whenever I watch an episode of Game of Thrones.

Each dark, tortured, back-stabbing, manipulative, seductive, deceitful, captivating episode is like an hour-long movie. Each one keeps me guessing and on the edge of my seat. The acting is flawless as each actor has been perfectly cast for their part.

I have to admit that I ""gorged"" on Season 2 after purchasing it to stream from Amazon. I spent an entire weekend glued to the screen watching the various story lines continue to unfold from season one.

To be honest, I resisted Game of Thrones for the first two seasons, which is why I am streaming online now (and becasue I do not have cable or satellite). I thought an epic saga with multiple story lines, set in a fantasy world where magic and dragons and undead and brave knights and fair maids and the list goes on...could not possibly maintain superior production values and writing and acting...but it has.

And that is why I am hooked.

The streaming quality from Amazon was excellent. The price was worth it. And I look forward to season three.",1375660800,2,1132,4.668341708542713
4921854,5,B0060MYM3S,"The packaging is pretty good.  Discs weren't moving around inside or anything cheap like that.

There is an outer box and inside are two folded binders.  The bigger one has the Blue Ray and the smaller one has the regular DVD version.  The imagery print on the inside is nice too.  There is a print of some of the main characters on the binders.

The DVD navigation menus were simple and worked.  (I used VLC Player on my computer to play these.)

I discovered on the blue ray there is extra content but I can't watch since I don't have a blue ray player yet.

As far as the whole series goes, I watched one and found I wanted to watch more.  So I watched the entire 12 or so hours worth of episodes in one sitting.  Very beautiful landscapes and costumes, fully developed characters, and very interesting story line.  I found it easy to identify with at least one character which sucks you in some more.  The music matches the overall story telling and mood.  Transitions between scenes in my opinion are creatively done.  It even adds some humor into it.  The setting is in a fictional land.  There is magic, dragons, and prophecy in the story.  There is nudity but not excessive and where appropriate in the story telling.  It would seem the movie is about a fight between good and evil.  So as you watch you will try to figure out each character as far as who is good and who is evil, who is trustworthy who is not, etc but you find it is not so clear cut and events change people.

Overall the story moves along.  Each episode is a clear advancement from the previous.  You will feel something is building up and something big will happen as the story continues to unfold.",1375574400,,1677,4.373376623376624

Life was dangerous in that world, nobody is safe.  You'll be sad when a beloved character bites it and you will love to hate the bad guys.  In fact, it's not very clear who is good or bad, they're just very real to life characters trying to make their way in this fantastic story.

The Blackwater battle was well done but I missed Tyrion's chain. After all, it made the firing of the fleet successful. I'm looking forward to the dragons getting bigger and seeing what comes next.

The season is focused on women and the lead men seem to get very little screen time.  They even introduced a 6' 6"" tall female warrior who kicks male butt.  Sorry, but all these women leaders and warriors offends my sense of reality.  I realize the show is a fantasy and anything goes but season two exceeded my ability to stretch my credibility.  And in any case I, a male, don't relate to queens and female warriors and the show simply became boring.",1374883200,,572,4.4

4921923,5,B0060MYM3S,Challenging story.  Brilliant character development.  Awesome archetypes.  Suspenseful.  Anyone can die at any time...or not.  Scenery is even more glorious than season 1 because it's real.  Good mix of fantasy and reality.  I'm totally addicted.  Can't wait for season 3.,1374364800,,272,5.625
4921924,5,B0060MYM3S,great show to go with great books.  if only HBO would put the seasons out more frequently or let you buy them as the season goes along.  a must see show,1374364800,,152,3.870967741935484
4921925,4,B0060MYM3S,"Action, macabre violence, dragons, magic, plot twists, nudity, surprises - this series has it all. A little darker than I would have liked, which is why I give it 4/5 stars, although others will most certainly disagree. It is an interesting jaunt into a darker world where good men and women who make noble choices do not always win. In fact, they usually end up dead in a most gruesome manner. I would say this is likely the most realistic representation of power struggles and the extents to which the powerful are willing to go to secure their ""rightful place"" in their world.",1374278400,,579,4.631067961165049

4921929,4,B0060MYM3S,as good as the first season - I think the story moved too quickly; a lot left out which was driven by the length of the books. Lots of things happening.  Given how well the first season was done I can't imagine why it was chopped up and parts that were rewritten weren't nearly as good as what happened in the book(s).  Didn't writers/producers think it was going to be a popular series? It could have had more episodes or TV seasons.  I suppose there is another season #4 coming but that won't make up for all the plots and subplots swept aside by season 2.  Haven't watched season 3 yet -- don't feel pressed to buy it or watch it.  Too bad.,1374278400,,643,4.195121951219512
4921930,3,B0060MYM3S,"Thumbs down on the ""digital copy"". You don't get a digital copy. I was expecting a separate disc with compressed versions of the episodes I could copy to my movie NAS. Nope. You get streaming from obscure cloud services that want to install adware on your devices and opt-out-only spam after making you jump through hoops to even get to the point where they let you down. This cloud access will of course disappear relatively soon with no apology and no recourse. This DRM garbage is the reason piracy exists. I recently found a Bluray ripper so I can make my own digital copy now anyway.

The movies on disk are great. The HD and CGI are very well done. The lighting and contrast are clean. The box is sturdy and the disks are safe.

A+ for the show itself. I'll defer to the more verbose reviewers.",1374192000,,800,4.4353741496598635

What was the director thinking when adding this to the show...it's really unnecessary, they could've just had the king give the orders and not show it, people are not that stupid that they can't understand what's going on... Unfortunately, season 2 has the same sick and disturbing crap in it. At the end of episode 2 they show, well, you hear another baby being eaten by some kind of monster...terrible. How can anyone find this entertaining, you have to be one bored sick loser if you do.

4921942,4,B0060MYM3S,"Having read book 1, A Game of Thrones, and being 3/4 of the way through book 2, A clash of Kings, I did enjoy the film, but not without some disappointments due to unnecessary changes from the book to the film.

While in the book there was much color and luxury and detail, the film was visually relatively drab and dark. I also didn't appreciate the changes to some of the plots, e.g. in Arya's experiences.

I felt the episodes were too short, and the costumes and scenery were too limited.

The acting was good, and I liked the film, and loved many of the characters while hating others, but over all I'm disappointed in it after having read the books first. Nevertheless, I'll want to watch season 3 after I read book 3, A Storm of Swords.

Again, the film was to me visually dark while in the book there was such magnificent color and splendor of costumes, scenery, architecture, etc.. Always in my mind while watching the film was the sensation that it looks so dark.",1374019200,,973,4.449438202247191

4921971,4,B0060MYM3S,"The ""Thrones"" books are a great read and I would recommend both the books and the TV series to anyone with an interest in medieval/fantasy style fiction. I enjoyed the fact that the story is allowed to be presented on its own merits, without million dollar special effects or over-glamourized hollywood style makeup, costumes, backdrops...etc. That being said, I was disappointed that the plot strays from the book, and in some cases it is a blatantly obvious attempt to add shock value with flagrant nudity and sex scenes. Don't misunderstand me. I am an adult and I am not offended by nudity or sex. It is only the addition of such scenes when they do not follow the original storyline that I find disappointing. All things considered, I would recommend this series, but I would suggest reading the book/s first.",1373500800,,814,4.821428571428571

4921974,3,B0060MYM3S,"I may step on some toes here, but after watching two seasons it finally became clear what I miss on this series. I love the genre, I love the acting, story is great too and the scenery is splendid. But I missed something. In series two it became clear what it was: the screenplay.

A picture says more than a thousand words. As such it is the hard task of a screenplay writer to translate long sections of text into often just seconds of film. But he or she also must make sure the relevant elements in these segments are still noticed by the viewers. Also sometimes pages of text are to build characters and therefore important. In season 2, this is where it derails on occasion.

Sometimes long scenes are wasted on things which even in hindsight added little character or storyline. E.g. Snow's story is full of these details. Now I like, no love, slow stories and even more so Snow's character, but in the end every second of film is at the expense of another. It is not and-and, but or-or in the expensive business of film. So the result is that on other occasions important events are a bit rushed. Out of now where two new kings with massive 100.000 men pop up, making the hard struggle of the North with its original 18.000 men not so heroic and impressive. Or Winterfell is seen burning with little explanation on where its sieging friendlies have gone.

Note, before someone tries to comment on these specific examples. All of them have explanations, but it is the mapping of the events in the books onto the film in terms of time spend which go wrong on occasion.

That said, the acting is very good, and so is the dcor and storyline itself. I'll be buying season 3 for sure, but season 2 was not as great as season 1 due to the lesser screenplay.

To finish the review. The DVD box itself is of high quality. Except the gluing of the outside inner box is sloppy. Both in season 1 and 2 the paper on it was lose out-of-the-box. Nothing some office glue could fix, but this should not happen with such an otherwise great quality DVD box.",1373414400,,2047,4.3905013192612135

4921982,5,B0060MYM3S,"Series:
After so much teasing about magic in the 1st season, it was very rewarding to see magic slip back into the world. Especially those damn-adorable baby dragons.
Plot-wise, I loved seeing how the 7 Kingdoms reacted to Ned Stark's investigation and wrongful execution.
-3 Kings rise to overthrow one, but the greed of one prevents them from working together to take on the strongest threat. Otherwise, False King Geoffrey's head would be piked by now.

Danny's journey to, and in, Qarth was very rewarding. We see more and more how her love and commitment makes her better suited for the throne than any of the 4 Kings to the west.

Jon's mission beyond The Wall isn't quite what I expected. The north is more tame than most give it credit, with the ever-elusive creatures still appearing as shadows. The Wildlings make the Crows of the south look more desperate than I realized. But the best part of this storyline is easily the last scene of the season.",1373328000,,959,4.7023809523809526

Fortunately, we have not had the ""unskippable preview"" problem....not sure why others can't go directly to the movie by hitting ""episodes"" and ""next""...We do not have TV so we read the books and wait for the ""seasons"" to come available.  We have completed up to through disk 4 of this 5 disk season 2 box set and it has played flawlessly.  However, we don't bother with blu ray because we are not interested in all the ""extras"" and have yet to find them any more ""spectacular"" than the plain DVDs...maybe that is the reason we are not having any of the problems listed by other viewers.

We are enjoying this series very much but, (and I want to state we certainly are not prudes in any way), but we get tired of what we feel is unnecessary and very graphic sex and nudity scenes.  This production would be just as fantastic without seeing an over-abundance of frontal nudity and sex scenes that rival even some porno flicks I've seen....not necessary at all...and I find these offensive especially for a production that is available on HBO/TV.  If the author feels the need to put it in the books, fine....but it is out of place where ""family viewing"" could be an issue.

Eagerly waiting for Season 3 although I've read it will not be available until Feb 2014!  How distressing!",1372636800,,1326,4.6127659574468085
4922029,5,B0060MYM3S,"If you are thinking of buying season 2, you probably are already sold on the the show. The upside to this package is it comes with Blue Ray (which I use at home) and the DVD version (which I take with me if I want to watch it away for home or a friend wants to borrow the series who doesn't have Blue Ray).",1372636800,,306,3.796875
4922030,5,B0060MYM3S,"One never knows when a show picks up and heads into its second season if it will sustain the good from the first season.  Game of Thrones Season Two not only picks up where Season One left off, but carries us deeper into intrigue and betrayal and mystery and magic.

Since so much of this show is based on very believable scenes of a society loosely based in the days of knights and sword-fighting, I was a bit worried about how it would work when they ramped up the magic end of things, but they did very well.  Not only are the special effects very well done, but they are tasteful, as well.

The characters remain fascinating, some of whom you grow to love and some of whom you come to hate.  However, no one in this show is perfect and everyone has their part in the ""game,"" even if they wished they didn't have to.

Tyrion, the ""half-man"" definitely comes into his own in this series as he shows that, deep down, he can not only care, but care deeply.  Joffrey, the current king whose backside polishes the Iron Throne is a horrid spoiled, cowardly at heart, and downright nasty little boy...yet the others who are vying for his position turn out to be not much better.  While, Theon realizes that going after what he thought he wanted has serious consequences that he never wanted.  All the while, winter is coming and Snow, up beyond the Wall in the North (beautifully filmed in a bleak, lonely, and ice -covered landscape)comes face to face with the worst nightmares of those of the South.  Oh, and about those dragons...definitely this season has built into it shades of what's to come.

Despite the magic that crops up now and again in the plot, this show is very realistic in its portrayal of the best and worst of human nature.  It can be VERY graphic at times for sex (both gay and straight) and violence, so it may not be for all.

Can't wait for Season Three!!!!!",1372636800,,1878,4.424418604651163

I have to admit that HBO did a free weekend recently and I was front and center for all 3 seasons.

One of the best things about the dvd are the featured actors commentary on each episode. Very entertaining to see what was going on while certain scenes were being filmed. And being blu ray, the glorious detail on the costuming is astounding.

The ninth episode ""Blackwater"" is my favorite of the bunch. It's focused tight on the battle about to happen at King's Landing, and Peter Dinklage and Lena Headey absolutely shine in this episode. Honestly, Dinklage should have won an Emmy for it.",1372377600,,660,4.780701754385965

4922108,5,B0060MYM3S,"Despite some pacing issues due the complexity of adapting George R.R. Martin's books, GAME OF THRONES is for sure one of the best TV shows ever made. Acting, casting, dialogues, locations and art direction are top notch. The show is unlikely any fantasy show ever made. And finally fantasy is being shown as a adult, thought provoking genre.

4922112,5,B0060MYM3S,So I finally decided to watch this series after putting it off for a long time. First season was decent.. I enjoyed it and wasn't bored but I didn't think it was worthy of the hype... Then season 2 came along and things started to get real!

4922122,4,B0060MYM3S,"Definitely not meant to be watched this children as it is full of violence and explicit sexual scenes.  This show is wonderfully written (most of the time) and expertly acted- which is so rare unfortunately for tv that it's popularity has soared just as the expertly written and performed Downton Abbey is.  You would think the popularity of such productions would get producers to see that talent in the writing room and in front of the camera is the thing audiences starve for most, but alas- for every one good show there seems to be a hundred that are terrible.

I do love season two, but it moves a little slower than season 1 did.  There are even a couple of episodes where- dare I say it?- things get a little bit boring because there is long stretches of not much story moving along.  But even those episodes aren't bad and the acting remains great.  The full frontal nudity that seems to be required of every female actress on the show becomes a bit comical because there is no real point to it most of the time.  In all the sex scenes the women are completely naked (the young and pretty ones that is) while all the men seem to magically be able to screw with their pants and shoes on. Showing blatant inequality between what is expected of the male actors and what is expected of the female ones.  There is one very brief scene with full frontal male nudity, but it is not sexual and only done once. Also espite this being set in an age where women are expected to stay celibate until marriage (except for the prostitutes), all the unmarried women who are not prostitutes too often show to have no problem having pre-marital sex and quickly succumb when asked. It has gotten so that it's obvious the nudity is just the director and writers wanting to see a new actress's goodies so it takes you out of the production a bit. Perhaps a professional critic said it best QUOTE:  """"Sometimes Game of Thrones uses sexual scenes to shed light on character. But quite often, it shows naked women because it can. At times, the show appears to be trying to cover up clunky exposition with naked flesh, and at other moments, the vibe comes off as, 'Hey! It's HBO! Here are some boobs!'"" end quote.

But here's the interesting thing... despite all of these distractions from the story, the dialogue is often so good and acted so well that it still remains an amazing show.",1371340800,,2371,4.493023255813953
4922123,5,B0060MYM3S,Game of Thrones is amazing it is scandalous and fun and raunchy I would suggest it to any and every one I don't know if you need to buy the dvd set or not but I did because once you see it you will want to watch it over and over again.....,1371254400,,239,3.6153846153846154
4922124,5,B0060MYM3S,"Game of Thrones continues to receive overwhelmingly popular reviews (heading the yearly ""best of"" lists of Time and The Washington Post among others) while its plot lines make the front pages of the newspapers.

DVD sales are stratospheric: 241,00 copies of this second series box set sold on the first day of release. On television millions anticipate the next episode on Sky.

""Arya"" is the fastest growing girl's name in the States and indeed ""Game of Thrones"" itself has now become a widely used term for political power-play.

Why? What is it about this cod-medieval drama which has hit the spot for so many people?

Locations are unusual and somewhat unlikely, ranging from Northern Ireland to Dubrovnik; the cast contains few stellar names; the budget, though massive, doesn't allow for grand action scenes on the scale of the movies.

However, underpinning the series are the books, the as yet unfinished collection of fantasy novels by George R.R. Martin. The narrative drive which the books provide means the viewer is gradually immersed in the world of Westeros, and once hooked is then a captive witness to the unfolding drama.

The pace of the storyline is deceptive and unpredictable; long periods of dialogue will be interrupted by a sudden and occasionally shocking event. Characters which one has come to know will meet a brutal end seemingly before their time. The endless capability to surprise means that the story maintains a strange kind of reality, despite its somewhat melancholic other-worldliness.

Production values are beyond those which one might think strictly necessary for a TV epic. A whole new language was created for the Dothraki, entailing months of linguistic development. Costumes and sets reference the medieval and are at times exquisitely beautiful, helping this make-believe pageant to become a functioning totality.

The on-screen detail is such that I at least am content to watch one episode several times before moving onto the next.

If you've resisted so far then I envy you. A fantastic journey lies ahead.",1371254400,,2056,5.15015015015015

When I found out in ""real life"" he's 20yrs old I was surprised. He is a good actor and he does his character justice, making him evil and easy to hate (for me), but I just can't stand him! LOL! This show has a great cast and writing. I tried reading the books but could not, it was too much for me, even an avid reader, too many characters and places and I had trouble keeping track of and understanding everything.

The casting is absolutely superb for ever character. I couldn't imagine it going any other way. There is a LOT of nudity and sex and it is ""rape-y"", but I suppose for the time that this is all taking place, it's (not perfectly but) pretty accurate.

One thing is the TV series does not completely mirror the books; they take a few liberties here and there (some stuff I think they just make up to fill some parts).  However, the acting is usually very good, and I love the drawf character.  Once in a while they throw in a nude scene, but fortunately it is usually somewhat connected to the story or to showing how a character is through his actions.  There's lot of intrigue, and occasionally a battle or something violent, but most of the story is in various double crosses, back stabbings, and other such court behavior.  Since I have read all the books, nothing surprises me except the way they sometimes handle the various scenes depicting what happens (again through their own vision).  If you saw the first season and liked it, you will like this one too (I did).",1370476800,,879,4.531645569620253

Plenty of both sex and violence, drama and exploration of a slightly different world.  The actors really seem to get into these great characters they play.  The costumes, sets, and special effects are all incredible.  It is hard not to get totally absorbed in the story.  While I will admit it isn't for everyone, if this is your genre, I can't imagine anything your won't like about it.  I have a hard time pulling myself away from it once I start watching.

The show does a pretty good job of bringing this to life. However there are times when the show goes on its own path. Season 2 had a lot of that. Several meaningful plot lines were completely rewritten in comparison to the book giving the series a different feel. Not for the better and not necessarily for the worse. The hard part as George R.R. Martin said in an interview a few months back is going to be how is the TV show going to write back in or around some characters they killed off in Season 2 when they should show up extensively in Season  4 and onward. The special features should not leave anyone disappointed.",1370390400,,780,4.27027027027027

4922181,5,B0060MYM3S,Season 2 continues the story of the intrigue between the various houses vying for power in Westeros. It also continues the story of Dany ( mother of dragons) as well as that of Jon Snow who is involved at the Wall in guarding the kingdom.,1370217600,,238,4.311111111111111
4922182,4,B0060MYM3S,"I loved the 2nd Season of GoT. The only complaint I have about this product is the fact that ALL the extra/bonus material is on the Blu-Ray discs. The regular DVDs are 2-sided discs with just the episodes. I buy DVD/Blu-Ray combos all the time, and they've always had the same material on both. I was surprised when I bought this. So for those who don't have a blu-ray player, it is better to just buy the regular DVDs since the extra material is included.",1370217600,,456,4.376470588235295

4922185,5,B0060MYM3S,"Game of Thrones is many things and I won't bother to belabor them. Season 2 has many of the strengths and weaknesses of season 1. If you loved season 1, why are you reading this review? Just buy it. Otherwise, here are a couple comments:

 - This season is probably more sexually graphic than the first. Sometimes, this is woven into the story; often it feels gratuitous. I have no hard feelings towards those who call Game of Thrones ""elf porn"".
 - I think season 2 gets slightly deeper, philosophically, than season 1. Some protagonists make troubling decisions that could inspire good discussion.
 - The music, visuals, and acting are as stellar as fans have come to expect.",1370217600,,677,4.711864406779661

4922189,5,B0060MYM3S,the budget must have been increased as there seems to be far more special effect scenes than in the first. The story continues on at a steady pace while developing an even larger cast of likeable characters.,1370131200,,207,4.621621621621622

There is no difference and the casting is perfect (of course the books have a bit more detail). Although I enjoy this series very much, and generally have no trouble suspending disbelief, I do have one complaint/question.  If the characters are all (mostly) so selfish and ruthless, how did they even survive this long? They're dropping like flies already, and it will continue!",1369872000,,492,4.788235294117647

The heroes are flawed, and many of the ""evil"" characters are conflicted. There is treachery, plot twists, no character is safe.  There is action a plenty, at times, very brutal. Life is very hard. Absolutely viewing for mature adults only.  Can't wait for season 3!

The extra features contained in this season set elaborate on the back-story of the characters, which adds more depth for an audience who may not have read the ""A Song of Ice and Fire"" book series. I know, not everyone likes to read. lolz. Enough talk though. 5 stars all the way.

By time you are watching season 2 you now know who everyone is and you cant wait to see what is going to happen to them next. Oh and you will have the characters that you love to hate (Joffery to name one). You hope to see them get their just desserts. The great thing about having the DVD's is you can re watch an episode as needed. Once again I watched this season within a day or two because I did not want to wait to see what was going to happen.

4922270,5,B0060MYM3S,"Lord of the Rings has ruled the fantasy roost for over 60 years, reinvigorated by the recent 3 part film version. Game of Thrones has much in common with LOTR (not the least of which is that Sean Bean gets killed off at the end of the first installment.) but as filmed works, there are a few really big differences, which are illuminating about the TV versus feature film medium, which has a far higher budget per hour of viewing time. The feature film can have many more elaborate effects, including truly epic battles. LOTR has two battle scenes which would exhaust the budget of a TV series year in that 30 minutes of film. So how does the small screen make up the difference. In a word, it is Sex. The earlier series ""Rome"" had at least one sexually explicit scene per episode. ""Game of Thrones"" is even more explicit, including at least one homosexual bedroom scene. The good side of this is that the lead cast is almost perfectly balanced (roughly 14 out of 30 lead characters are women, if you don't count the headliner, Peter Dinklage, who is in a class by himself.) This is a dramatic change from LOTR, which had only three women in important roles, and that was done by major expansion of Arwen Evenstar's role over what we read in the novels. So, even though I know LOTR has a lot of female fans, ""Game of Thrones"" is a far better narrative for woman's roles, mostly as advisors and behind the back deal makers and game changers for the make kings. There is even a full blooded queen pretender to the ""Iron Throne"".

Regarding the DVD release, I'm really happy with the additions. Every episode has a voice over commentary, but some, from the writers, directors, creators, and lead adult actors is better than those done by the child actors. That is not to say their performances on screen are not first rate. Maisie Williams as Arya Stark and Isaac Hempstead-Wright as Bran Stark are both exceptional.

And... Peter Dinklage clearly deserves the several acting awards he has received for his role in the series. I am now a big fan of his work.",1368662400,,2055,4.536388140161725

Season Two was just a little disappointing after that.  It starts out following the second book, but then jumps around some.  I picked up a few lines from later books, and some were even said by different characters.  If you've read the books you'll be able to follow it, and if you haven't read the books it won't matter, so no harm either way.

The Bad: Lame trading card, pricey for what you get over just buying the episodes.

I absolutely love the narrated animation pieces. Hands down best part of the whole product. Each piece is well executed and provides tremendous insight into the universe that extends beyond the series and into the novels. I always like the DVD combo packs, so that's another plus.

All that aside, I want more. Nay, I need more. I want more in-depth features than Robb and Cat talking about motivations. At least it is better than the Stark kids performing their rendition of the GOT opening theme acapella. How about a bit more Peter Dinklage??

The blu rays are in top quality, and I was thrilled to have the digital copies (although for this and the download of Season 1 digital copies http://www.amazon.com/Game-Thrones-Complete-Blu-ray-Digital/dp/B00AB55BS0/ref=sr_1_1?s=movies-tv&ie=UTF8&qid=1368277822&sr=1-1&keywords=game+of+thrones+season+1, the download took over a week on iTunes).

This show is really one of the best quality shows that I have come across in a really long time. The writing is amazing, the acting is amazing, and the characters are multi-dimensional, real, and in some cases inspiring. I love all of the strong women leads (for me, Daenerys really makes the show what it is). I will also say that those people who are not fans of the books may still enjoy the show. With no disrespect to George R. R. Martin, when I tried the books after viewing the show, I wasn't really a fan of then in written form, which may sound odd considering that the show is supposed to be pretty reflective of the books, but I found that the writing and the ways in which the characters are presented in the show versus the books came off differently.

Wonderful show, and highly recommended once again!",1368230400,,1281,5.203883495145631

Still such rich production and love the way scenes end and transition between multiple story lines. Brings deceit and back stabbing to new level. Great balance of so many sub-plots that are tied together just enough to make you feel like you have a view of such a tremendous, complex world. Never know what to expect with main characters meeting their demise when totally unexpected. Love a story were you can never take things for granted and I am taken to a place I did not expect.

At first I thought it was just me that I could not figure out how to use CC on our tv although I already have it turned on for cable broadcast. I found out after we watched the season that CC is not an option for our tv brand. In fact Amazon Instant Video supports hardly any CC for tvs. Unfortunate since I have tinnitus and need CC especially for those shows that use English speaking actors with heavy accents like Australian or Scottish I ended the trial version of Amazon Prime until they get CC fixed.

Blu-ray is the way to go bc of durability. This series is incredible, read the books too bc you will be addicted and waiting for the new series to be released is so hard to do.

4922342,5,B0060MYM3S,"If you enjoyed Season 1, then there's no reason you won't like Season 2 of HBO's Game of Thrones.  This show is excellent.  Season 2 starts to explore the magical elements of George RR Martin's universe, something that Season 1 largely left obscured from view.  Season 2 maintains the excitement and pacing witnessed in the latter half of Season 1 through out its duration.  More than the 1st season, this one got me hooked to GoT.
This particular box set includes a booklet with the Claimants to the Iron Throne, which is helpful in sorting out the intertwined story lines.  The show looks AMAZING in blu-ray quality.  Although this set is expensive, it is entirely worth the money.",1367884800,,683,4.745762711864407

My favorite character just got killed off, but at least there are dragons now.  I keep waiting for it to get good.  I get really bored with fantasy stuff, I'm more into sci-fi and real world stuff.

4922352,5,B0060MYM3S,"I'm a big fan of the books, but I was afraid of what would happen to them on HBO. Nothing to fear--HBO has followed the books brilliantly and in fact, has helped simplify some of the plotlines and characters so my tiny brain can absorb them. Peter Dinklage is phenomenal.",1367798400,,271,4.44

However, there are very few shows worth watching, very few.  Besides Doctor Who, this is the only other show I watch religiously and wait ever week with bated breath.  The triple combo (BD, DVD, digital) makes it perfect for anyone, prices on amazon are by far cheaper, and the behind the scenes with Emilia Clark will make you fall in love again.",1367798400,,548,4.628865979381444

4922359,4,B0060MYM3S,"There are so many good things about this show. It's like a less refined version of ""War and Peace"" with many interwoven plots and unexpected character developments; it's probably based on a book series but the show is so well done that I don't feel the need to read it. Unlike W&P, many of the characters you like can and some will indeed die, sometimes quite suddenly which adds to the authentic feel of the story.

I normally don't like entertainment media in this genre (medieval fantasy) but this show holds my attention, possibly because it focuses more on medieval politics than magic and swordplay.",1367712000,,605,4.761904761904762

4922364,5,B0060MYM3S,"I liked the combo because people are always borrowing movies from me and I don't like being without a copy.  This way I can lend out the DVD version and keep the Blue-ray for myself.
The special features were nice as there was some information there that was not in the HBO Series or the books, so it helped round out the picture of this setting.",1367625600,,346,4.242424242424242
4922365,5,B0060MYM3S,"Originally, I was privy to a Comcast 'watchathon' for Game of Thrones where I had to watch the whole of the series in about 5 days. I was addicted from the first episode and that last line, 'The things I do for love' shove, heheh. That led me to grabbing both seasons on DVD here at Amazon, and also, the books here locally. They run quite parallel, so fans of one should become fans of the other interchangeably with little grousing. Each season is like watching a 10 hour movie, and it's HBO so all the violence, gore and sex is graphically shown. The 10 hours in each season have been roughly one book apiece; Season one mirroring A Game of Thrones, and season two is near A Clash of King's mimic. Season three, which is currently (May 2013) running on HBO and it has been a fantastic near copy of A Storm of Swords. I'll have to be buying that as well when it releases.

The story, from George RR Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire, is full of palace intrigue, all in effort to win the game of thrones and place their king or themselves upon the Iron Throne. The settings are rich and full, HBO spared no expense, and the acting is of a quality equal or exceeding the characterizations. Peter Dinkledge even won an Emmy for his portrayal, and I'm sure there are more trophies and nominations in this series that I can't recall or will come as things progress. You'll fall in love with Daenerys, love to hate to love Tyrion, cry for Arys and Sansa, and loathe Joffrey and Cersei, and experience any number of emotions for the rest of these deep characters that will become old friends, and enemies.

Gather your wits, for you'll need them, and some popcorn and the beverage of your choice and prepare to be extremely entertained.",1367625600,,1729,4.41692789968652

4922368,1,B0060MYM3S,"I know I order a lot of books, but this is ridiculous when I receive a book instead of the DVD.

Basically it tells you about the religions, history of houses, and events like Robert's Rebellion, but from the point of view of various different characters! Really great way to learn the back story and help to really grasp who they're talking about and why things are as they are!

4922412,5,B0060MYM3S,Show does a decent job of sticking to the books. Such a vast world and story is hard to compress into 10 episodes. Well done though. Best show on TV,1367107200,,148,3.966666666666667

It is a bit more fragmented SPOILER? because groups/characters once all around each other sort of split up END SPOILER so it may seem less cohesive to some but it is done aptly and never becomes confusing. Again,m as with my Season 1 review, I am reading the books (currently almost done with Book 4 (feast of crows) and I am both happy and not at all confused with any changes made for the series. I could see this series going to 7 seasons, so here's hoping they all stay on course!

By the way, Season 3 so far is splendid as well...",1367020800,,662,4.171875
4922418,3,B0060MYM3S,"I loved the first season- it followed the book almost to the letter. I was really disappointed in the second season. A lot of the major and minor details of the book were changed- they even gave Theon Greyjoy's sister a different name. The story of Danaeris is also totally different- someone steals her dragons- she gets them back, but that's not the point. Oh, and Stannis has sex with the Red Priestess. Right there on his map table. I don't remember THAT happening either. Aria's story is pretty true to the original, but that's small consolation in the larger scheme of things. If you don't appreciate a screen version taking artistic license with the contents, don't bother ordering the second season- you will be very disappointed. If you don't care, it's a good story all the same and the filmography is really quite sumptuous.",1367020800,,835,4.76551724137931

4922421,5,B0060MYM3S,"At first I was not sold on it, sounded like another boring lords & ladies drama. Don't get me wrong I like King Arthur, in small doses like a 2hr movie not a Season.

Well thanks to the flu & HBO's talent for TV marathons I happen to catch a season 2  episode where more than a little drama was going on... Not sure if the fever was inducing hallucination's I kept watching & liked it. It kept my attention, the characters, the story, the depth! So now I have to start from the beginning while my DVR records S3 & I don't tell my friends I'm watching it so they don't spoil it for me.

Although I did see S3 opener, it just makes it all the more interesting and draws you in. Yes it's lords & ladies but with Dragons, Wolves, Zombies, Witches, Warlocks and enough plot twists to make your burst. Don't get to attached to anyone, everyone is fare game to be killed in this epic series.

There are commentaries on nearly every episode with some having two.

Amazon is ruining streaming TV.",1366329600,,333,4.771929824561403
4922548,5,B0060MYM3S,"This is a very well-made, well-acted, exciting
film with breathtaking locations. My only complaint
is that it is sometimes so gory I have to close my
eyes and miss some key plot points.

However, there are so many characters I often lose track
of who is who. Many of the men look the same to me in
armor. And even when I know their name I have to
google them to see who exactly they're related to. But
this is not a fault of HBO. When reading the books I
often had to refer to the appendix for the same reason.

Is it just me? Can anyone offer any suggestions?",1366329600,,560,4.081818181818182

All the chapters and stories with The Imp are very enjoyable, specially this season and in the clash of kings book, where we see Tyrion as a political mastermind in all his greatness. Dinklage, two thumbs up!. And add some direwolves action, and you're all set. Excellent blu-ray edition.",1366329600,,425,4.68

If you love the fantasy genre, watch it, you won't regret it. Buy and watch season 1 first!",1366329600,,263,4.717391304347826
4922552,4,B0060MYM3S,"This Blu-Ray DVD combo pack is an exceptional value, especially given the extras that are included. Season 2 of Game of Thrones is possibly even more exciting than the first season - definitely better special effects and more of them.  Also the acting seems even better, I suppose as the actors develop their characters more fully and the plot expands. Dinklage, Rory McCann, Charles Dance, and Maisie Williams are all riveting this season. A couple of episodes dragged for me, but possibly because other episodes were so outstanding that these suffer by comparison. All in all, the season is gorgeous, bloody, sexy, and harrowing all at once. You can't ask for much more than that.
As to the extras, there are twelve commentaries on these discs; some episodes having two commentaries. I'm apparently the noisiest person alive - I adore commentaries. And most of these are interesting, informative and funny, I do have one complaint. This season, like last season, listening to the commentary by the young actors who portray the Stark children is painfully reminiscent of being the chaperone at a 'tweenage' party. These young actors are talented and charming, but I wish the producers would leave commentaries to the adults - especially given the mature nature of some scenes. The behind-the-scene bonus features are all excellent and interesting. My only other complaint is the hidden ""dragon egg"" bonus content. I paid for the extra content and I don't have the time or inclination to go looking for it. At least allow us to opt out of the hunt and provide a link to the dragon eggs.
All in all though, just an amazing season and an amazing combo.",1366329600,,1650,4.892857142857143

So we wait for this to come out every year and have a marathon. The Blu Ray edition is well worth it, a crisp transfer, great storytelling, and a marvelous cast. Worth it for the Battle of the Blackwater alone (is George RR Martin a Doobie Brothers fan?), this is one of the few DVD's we buy, because we will watch it again, The extras are good, you really need to watch it three times just to get them all in.

The show's plots are complex as are their characters.  The scenery and costumes are of the highest quality.  Sex and bloodshed are frequent themes that drive ""Game of Thrones"".  They have created an amazing fantasy world that just sucks you in.  With every episode we ask the question ""Is this when Joffrey gets it""?

The beauty of purchasing the stream through Amazon is that you can watch it at your leisure instead of having to wait a week for the next episode.  What usually happens is that we watch two episodes back to back and before you know it, they're all gone!",1366243200,,741,4.437037037037037

None of which bothers me, but for as much medias as I've consumed over the years, I was still somehow surprised at the levels of all of it. There'll be scenes with important dialogue, meanwhile the supporting cast will be moaning so loud I begin to wonder what my neighbors think I'm watching lol. But you can't turn it down b/c of the conversation...oh well.

The costume design, dialogue, and world they've created are spectacular. I don't usually do this but I even watched the special behind the scenes stuff after I finished the season (spoilers). They really go all out to immerse you in the world. Which...isn't completely based on reality, but borrows a lot from real cultures then mixes in a bit of magic. But not enough to call it a fantasy. It never feels like the main focus of the show, but it's definitely a strong undercurrent.

Season two was *slightly* worse than the first. The dynamics of the show shift compared to season one and I just favor the other. But I'm sure it'll change again in the next season. Still 5 stars.",1366156800,,1208,4.511415525114155

read the books I'll admit, but I didn't want to ruin watching the series. You know that
saying "" the book is better than the series"" well I don't know. I plan on reading the
series when the show goes off the air, which I hope won't be for a very long time.

I love being able to pull up episodes on my phone or computer without needing the disk - the only complaint I have about that feature is that I usually have to limit myself to one episode on my phone at a time, but that is only because I have too much other stuff on my phone - including movies - and videos do take up a good bit of space.

The first season went more slowly and set the stage.  The second season has skipped over a lot of detail that would explain much to the viewer.

Sex and violence are graphically depicted and it most definitely earns an R rating. It is a great series though and from the first episode you're hooked.

I was hooked from the first show of the series. I think I am one of the few people that has not read the book series but I want to. So many books, so little time.

I sat down and had a ""Game of Thrones Season 2"" watching marathon last night and loved season 2 also.

Special effects especially the battle scenes and the frozen north are fabulous. The costuming is gorgeous. I loved Peter Dinklage in season 1 and love his character and superb acting in season 2 just as much.

I love the battles, the strong women, the wildings, the frozen landscapes, the dragons (and can hardly wait until we see more of the dragons).

I don't get HBO so I'll need to wait for Season 3 on DVD. Time passes too slowly sometimes.

Oh, there's tons of female nudity in this season. Let's be equal opportunity and get some nice male specimens for the future seasons.",1365724800,,1061,5.2176470588235295
4922649,5,B0060MYM3S,"The books were great and this show has actually followed them pretty closely.  Peter Dinklage is amazing.  The show is well made and never strays into the ridiculus with the material.  Not for children, as there is lots of gratuitous nudity and sex.  However, much of the sex is used during exposition, which I find funny.",1365724800,,322,4.696428571428571

Season 2 reveals more of the magical aspects of the series.  I felt like this season had a lot of pieces moving around just to get them in place for what will happen in Season 3.  It did not seem as dark as the second book, but I still struggle with watching so much violence.  You know what you are getting with this show in that regard.",1365724800,,439,4.190476190476191

There was something about the story and the characters that seemed to draw me in. The drama these families are going through makes for entertaining television, for certain, but there is more going on than just bloodshed.

4922673,5,B0060MYM3S,"The characters seem so real and you make a connection with them when you read the books or watched season one, so when you see even more bad things happening to these people it really keeps you on the edge of your seat. Nothing ever goes right in the Game of Thrones, but it's met by just enough humor, romance, and dragons to not be over filled with angst. The show has created a great balancing act and so far they haven't fallen.

There are some changes from the book, like any adaptation will have, though it's disappointing to see some awesome parts missing, it's so gratifying when they get most of it perfect or add something that just pulls it all together. Like the scenes where Arya Stark and Tywin Lannister have there little conversations, it's just great and enjoyable while still seems to go together with the whole show. It also makes Tywin more rounded and less of just this embodiment of evil.

Over all it's better than first season and will blow your mind so just watch it already.",1365552000,,1000,4.489010989010989

4922727,5,B0060MYM3S,"or be prepared to lose your head!! There is absolutely nothing like THE GAME OF THRONES on TV or in the theaters. Here is one amazing show that will immediately grab the attention of most people. Wicked teenage King Joffrey shows no mercy to friends and enemies alike and there is danger in the kingdom as several pretenders have a more legitimate claim to the thrown than Joffrey.

Joffrey is the son of the deceased king of Baratheon clan but he is 100% Lannister though his mother and his biological father. Yes, we learn in Season One that the good Queen's children have all been fathered by her brother. We've learned soon enough that GAME OF THRONES is also a game of sexual misconduct - as if the political intrigue is not fascinating enough.

Season 2 does not disappoint anyone who was hooked on Season One. The drama and suspense continues. GAME OF THRONES is not hesitant to shock or surprise us. We lost a lead character in Season One so expect more in Season 2. No one is safe and no one will find mercy. This is a time of fear and violence in Westeros. No one is safe and no one can be trusted. It is a chore trying to keep all the characters in mind and to remember who they are in the scheme of life..who is related to whom and who betrayed a trusted friend..no to mention who is having an affair with a secret lover.

Peter Dinklage is a stand-out in Season Two. Tyrion Lannster, ""The half-man,"" as he often refers to himself, finds love and courage in Season 2. Tyrion is a dwarf who is barely tolerated by his Lannister father and siblings, yet he, alone, has a semblance of decency and humanity in his heart. The self-proclaimed coward finds the courage to fight for the Lannister Dynasty despite the evil and treachery of his nephew King Joffrey and his sister the Queen. Tyrion is redeemened in an absolutely amazing sea battle that is a keystone of Season Two. Tyrion's brilliance helps save the kingdom but praise will not come his way.

GAME OF THRONES is amazing on so many levels. The diverse and beautiful scenery and real. The snowy wastelands scenes were filmed in Iceland and were not computer generated. The amazing crew is beyond brilliant and stunning. Again, the hard part of GAMES OF THRONES is keeping track of everyone. The blu-ray does have a drop down menu to give you information on the characters throughout the episodes. I found it confusing and distracting and hard to read from a distance. I felt the blu-ray had some flaws in its menu and presentation but GAME OF THRONES is brilliant and I am waiting for Season 3.",1365292800,,2561,4.512931034482759

.. its several scratches on the clear plastic packaging in the area around the second disc.  its all superficial, and no discs were damaged, but its pretty disappointing to open a new purchase to see it suspiciously looking used.  (i do know it was not a used copy; as it was a pre-order purchase that was fulfilled by Amazon; and was opened by me only a few days after it was released to the market)

I have been reading the books of the Ice and Fire series for years and except for occasional small changes to the original tale,the TV series is pretty much spot on. The (to me) unfamiliar young actors all play their roles to perfection and it's good to see so many familiar faces amongst the older cast members if like me, one is an avid viewer of British drama.

This review is about the un-skippable ad at the beginning of the DVD, completely loaded with spoilers.

I got this DVD as a gift for my friend who hasn't seen any of season 2. They were spoiled within 30 seconds of watching by this ridiculous advertisement. Why on earth would anyone think it a good idea to force-advertise the show that is already being watched?? What an atrocious marketing department these guys have.

It's this reason alone I have to give this product 1 star, as it manages to completely ruin itself literally within 30 seconds of hitting ""Play"". If you give it as a gift or for yourself, just be warned.",1365033600,311,767,4.503597122302159

4922794,4,B0060MYM3S,"Game of Thrones Season 2

 I am not going to provide an episode-by-episode critique but just provide a few impressions and opinions of GOT 2.

Costumes, sets, locations and attention to small details continue to amaze and provided this viewer with an absorbing viewing experience.

While the actors selected for the roles continue to impress I still was uneasy with the men playing Jon Snow and Robb Stark. I think a more assertive warrior type individuals were called for in these pivotal roles.  My impressions have not changes after two seasons.

Religion played a larger role - or at least it was mentioned more often. Old gods new gods we shall see who prevails.

The fantasy elements were more developed in season 2. Most viewers are aware, I'm sure, there is a fine line between truly frightening images and just weirdness for weirdness sake. So far I have been impressed - in this area less is better, I say.

We saw more damp, dreary courtyards and castles - after a while one looked just like another. Therefore I was so impressed to see the city of Qarth with it's tropical settings and brightly clothed inhabitants. I was hoping we would spend more time in the magicians tower but, alas, a fiery puff from Daenery's dragons put an end to that!

 I do not subscribe to HBO so I am always a year behind the GOT released episodes. When I purchased GOT 2 it had been over a year since I had viewed GOT 1. I was lost! I did not want to jump into GOT 2 unless I was reasonably knowledgeable about who was related to who etc. I purchased and read an excellent guide ""Inside HBO Game Of Thrones"", not only was it lavishly illustrated but provided extensive background on the characters - more that you would learn from just watching the HBO films. Certainly I could have read the books, but then I would ""know"" what was to happen and that would take away from the pleasure of discovery.

 Fortunate folks watching GOT3! Well I have something to look forward too in 2014. I read on the News recently - 4/3/2013 - the GOT has been renewed for a 4th season - great!

Why 4 stars? Well, I found the 2nd season not quite as exciting as season 1.",1365033600,,2144,4.452685421994885

4922896,1,B0060MYM3S,"I love the show itself, but I'm giving the DVD set a 1 star review for one reason, and one reason only - the nearly four minutes of HBO promos that you have to sit through EVERY TIME you put the DVD in the player.  There's absolutely no way to skip them (menu button doesn't work, fast forward buttons don't work, stopping the disc then hitting menu doesn't work).  I PAID for these discs, I shouldn't be required to watch commercials for HBO every time I try to watch them.  I won't be buying any more HBO DVD sets, just because of this issue.  Do the companies putting these unskippable promos on their products really think that irritating their customers every time they put a disc in the player is good for business?

Update - I wrote the above after watching just the first two episodes.  It turns out the remaining discs don't have the unskippable promos before the menu.  Still annoying that disc 1 is that way though.  Complaining about here probably won't do much good, but on the off chance a DVD producing company should be reading this - most people watching your discs would be more likely to buy other products you're selling if you put the promos as an option that can be watched from the menu, rather than ruining the viewing experience with these unskippable commercials.",1364774400,42,1289,4.54978354978355

The package itself was great, and there is one main reason that makes the Blu Ray superior to all other editions (apart from quality): In-Episode Guide. Sometimes there is so much stuff happening and switching between locations, it can be hard to follow. But if you activate the in-episode guide, it can bring up the location, characters present with bios, and recent event history just by pressing the side arrow on a remote. Additionally, there is a lot of bonus content crammed on the fifth blu-ray disc, as well as all the episodes crammed onto two DVDs. Also, if you like that kind of stuff, there are commentaries on each episode. All in all, $30 is a no-brainer, and I would pay up to $50 if I had to.",1364688000,,808,4.3933333333333335

The locations that they film at are stunning and what special effects they use are amazing (wildfire...enough said).  The casting is excellent and I must say that one of the cast members (who plays a certain Stark daughter) even makes their character more enjoyable than she is in the books.  While the show does leave out some things, one does have to keep in mind that it is a TV show.  They cant include the same level of insane detail that the books do but that said I am overall pleased with how well done the show is and can not wait until I am able to see season 3.

If you're interested in what was left out from the show, go buy the books (which you'll likely finish before GRRM finishes book 6) as they are worth reading.  Keep in mind that they do have an insane level of detail and are not short books.

Way to go, George R. R. Martin and HBO!!!  Can't wait for Season 3!!

Also, the special features on the Blu-ray set are the most intuitive and helpful I've ever seen.  Having an interactive sidebar where you can pause the show at any moment and get a reminder of who the characters are in this scene, where it takes place and especially the little extra scenes you can listen to giving more background information on the locations and characters if you choose, is extraordinary!  What a great idea to add to this series in particular, which has so many characters and locations that it is difficult to keep track.  Genius.

I can't believe I got the blu-ray, DVD, *and* the Digital Download copy for such a great price!  1/3 of what I would have paid anywhere else for just one of those things.  Amazon, you rock.

After watching the first season it made me want to read the books which are just as amazing as the show. They pick the perfect actors/actresses to match the characters and they play them amazingly well.
I hardly ever pay for a physical copy of movies or tv since you can pretty much download anything for free these days, however this is one series I gladly will support and pay for.

4923175,4,B0060MYM3S,"George R.R Martin, and the producers have talked about it. With any minor change you make to the series you can end changing a lot of the original material.

Some changes were needed, the age of the cast for example. Daenerys is a 13 years old in the book series, and a lot of the things that happen on the book cannot be portrayed in the television show if she's of that age. So i'm ok with that change.

But there are other things that i don't really like at all. The House of the Undyiing part for example, it's much better the way it happens in the books, i felt really frustrated by the way it ended in the series.

The good part of that is that at least the upcome remains almost the same as they happened in the books.

What i fear is what will happen in the future.

(IF YOU HAVEN'T READ STORM OF SWORDS; DONT READ BELOW)

I see the Edric Storm part as one really interesting of the book. How do you balance the life of one person (one innocent) vs the lives of thousands to go on with Melisandre's ritual?. The problem is that in the TV Show they haven't even mentioned Edric Storm, in fact they hardly mention why Davos has to accompany Melisandre to the lower part of the castle, in season 2 when he does the smuggling part, it was to kill the Castellan that didn't wanted to part with Robert's bastard.  Which leaves me to think they won't mention him. And that means that this part of the plot won't even appear in the TV Show.

I understand the need to cut some things, but this is too iimportant just to be ignored.

This leaves me to think which other parts are they going to just ignore. I hope there aren't too many.

Overall i put 4 stars because of this. If they start at least taking into account the Edric Storm plot i would put 5 stars next season.",1364169600,,1771,4.167155425219941

So far the program is following the first two books.  Love the character development and the setting used throught the series, vivid, and they bring the locations in the books to life.  Don't know if there will be any new surprises in the program since I've finished reading the five books published to date.
I am also anticipating George R.R. Martin's publication of books six and seven, hope they will be coming soon.",1364083200,,602,4.616822429906542

4923214,2,B0060MYM3S,"Similar to the first season, production values remain very high (why I give two stars), but I couldn't recommend this to anyone who has actually read The Clash of Kings. I recognize the almost impossible task of trying to fit the contents of a 900+ page novel into ten episodes, so why then choose to invent scenes and characters, or rewrite them in unsatisfactory or unnecessary ways to extend the narrative in a manner totally incongruous with the book? I realize the convenience of collapsing characters, but why have them doing or saying things that never happen in the novel? What purpose is served by spending what appears to be precious time (ten episodes!) playing out long scenes that never achieve the intended pathos because they never resolve themselves in the intended manner?

I've noticed several reviews on Amazon in which five stars are given by reviewers who proudly state they've never read the books, and are very happy with the narrative qualities of this season. I wonder what they think they actually know, considering the bulk of the story never made it to the screen, and what did is so garbled and confused, or just vague and unfulfilled, that no one who hadn't read the book could otherwise know what is going on? Ignorance is bliss, but it's still ignorance.",1364083200,5,1286,4.819004524886878

The books have some of these parts but the writers of this show really seem to revel in focusing on them. In the few instances in the book where descriptive sex scenes occur, there is usually a good bit of character development that also happens during these scenes. The show seems to gloss over this nuance. I feel like it's distracting and a slight waste of time to throw these scenes in simply because it's HBO, it's shocking, and they can.

But, overall, it was an enjoyable season, and I look forward to season 3.",1364083200,,693,4.372093023255814

I've never read the books, but I am to understand that the show is following the books very closely which I admire.

I always recommend the series, both the books and the HBO series to my friends, but I suggest reading the books first before viewing the HBO series. The surprises in the story are best experienced first from the books. Having read the books makes viewing the screen version a more satisfying experience.

The story is so complicated, with so many characters, sub plots, etc., that one has to watch it more than once to catch everything.  I like the fact that captioning is available because I have some diffictulty understanding British/Irish speech patterns. The series (and the novels) are courageous with cutting edge violence and eroticism.  Not for the squeamish, but that is all right as this reviewer is not  As far as the story goes, as soon as the viewer thinks he has it all figured out, they throw a curve.  People you thought were ""immortal"" and beloved of the author can get killed off!  All bets are OFF!  Anthing is possible. Damn him!

I particularly like the simultaneous interviews in commentary mode.  It is fun to hear the parfticiapnts discuss how they were freezing to death in cold damp Iceland, while the cast in Croatia are having a blast enjoying Dbrovnik night life after the shoots.  Also, it is intertesting to learn that the actors who play the most despicfable creachers on screen are acturally the nicest people one would ever like to meet.  How disconcerting.

Why is it that most of those interviewed cannot resist humming along while the title music plays?  It merely shows how greatful they all are to be involved in a career project of a liftime.",1363996800,2,1336,4.706896551724138

 the series has done a good job portraying the heart of it. Good acting and production.
Attention to detail. Looks like a movie, not a series. Some may call it a fantasy series,
but the characters are real. They show the best and worst of humanity. Looking forward
to future seasons and the final books in the series. Thanks George R.R. Martin for your
books and all involved in the series for making it something special.",1363910400,,509,4.593406593406593

This series is very good and the fact that it is trying to stay close to the book storyline is pretty impressive.  Also the fact that they keep adding more and more characters, just as in the books, is a pretty nice change compared to your average sitcom style show.  Also, the way this fictional world is portrayed with the set designs and costumes is also detailed in making the world the show is set in very believable.  I can't wait for season 3 and also have season 1 on Blu-ray as well.  Almost considered getting HBO just to watch this show instead of having to watch it from a friend's house.

Be prepared for some blood and sex scenes throughout all seasons of this series, but you'll also meet a huge cast of interesting characters who each have well-developed storylines.

You will not be disappointed with this set.  Not only is the picture quality stunning, but the extras really make the set worth while for people that have seen the episodes multiple times.  It also came with a digital copy and dvd copy just for kicks.

The extras include commentary by the writers, director, and actors from the series.  Each episode has interactive guides on which house / character appears in the scene along with some background information on each.  There are also quick video shorts which flesh out more history of Westeros and battles referenced in the episode.

4923385,4,B0060MYM3S,"Having read all the books upon which this series is based, I have enjoyed to note the changes made for the screen version but ultimately delivered on the promise just as has the book.

A few characters were underwhelming in terms of the book descriptions such as ""the mountain""; his debut in the first series was imposing but in this one not so. Brienne delivered a stellar performance though I did quite think she matches the description. The scenes beyond the wall were okay but did not like the encounter between John Snow and the venerable Quoran half hand. The changes for the scene in Qarth was also underwhelming.

In all, these are just cosmetic shortfalls in an otherwise very good screen adaptation of a book",1363910400,,718,4.690476190476191

4923391,5,B0060MYM3S,"Reviewing this set feels like a repeat of season one, in that it is another excellent release from HBO.  They really know how to release a quality blu-ray set, from the handsome packaging down to the special features on the discs themselves.  Here's what you get -

- All 12 episodes, each with commentary
- Special features further exploring the world of Westeros
- Digital copies of both the episodes and the special features

As usual the episodes look beautiful on blu ray.  The color, depth, texture, and contrast visible in virtually any given scene are downright stunning.  This is the hallmark of HBO blu ray releases, and I'm glad to see that the blu ray transfer for GoT season 2 is as amazing as it was for season 1.  The audio is also top notch whether it's quiet moments being shared or the raucous din of combat.

The special features are pretty decent too.  The standout for me is the commentaries.  Each episode gets a commentary track but each track is different.  Some tracks feature writers/showrunners Benioff and Weiss which makes for a very technical, also very interesting, and information heavy commentary.  But then other commentaries feature the actors which are probably my favorite.  For example one commentary features the actors playing the Stark daughters, which is hilarious!  while another features the actors playing the Greyjoy children.  This variation keeps the commentaries from growing stale, is often hilarious, and feels much more intimate - like you're getting to know the people who make the show - than traditional commentaries.  If you're like me you'll find yourself re-watching the episodes then re-watching them again just to hear all of the commentaries.

As to the other special features they're also quite nice if you're interested in exploring the rest of Westeros.  If you haven't ready the books, and I can't blame you if you haven't, these are probably going to be incredibly useful.  Locations, characters, families, and histories are provided for different locales throughout Westeros and Essos.  These special features are by no means comprehensive, but they go a long way to helping you understand more about this world, e.g. what is the significance of ""The Rains of Castamere"" when Bron sings it before the ""Battle of Blackwater"", what does that say about the Lannisters?  Tywin?  etc.  Good stuff.

Lastly you get some digital copies.  I'm not a fan of digital copies as I'd rather simply not watch something as opposed to watching it on a mobile device, but for those of you who dig them this is a nice bonus.  I am glad that HBO seems to be including these on all of their releases now, and it's nice to have the option of downloading them in HD or SD.  So there's that.

In a nutshell the Game of Thrones season 2 blu-rays are the best way to watch and enjoy season 2.  I would recommend this set to anyone.  Period.  Seriously it's great go buy it.",1363910400,,2914,4.802816901408451

4923405,4,B0060MYM3S,"Overall, I quite liked the second season. It followed A Clash of Kings reasonably well and, like the first season, was overall well put together. However, I have a major complaint with it: very important characters were left out entirely, for example Meera and Jojen Reed, who are vital to Bran's subplot. ""Arstan Whitebeard"" and Strong Belwas should have been introduced to Daenerys' portion of the plot as well. The latter two will probably be introduced early in season three, but the Reeds may be somewhat more difficult, due to where the Neck is compared to where Winterfell is.
Another part of my complaint is essentially a part of the same. The destruction of Winterfell was, in the book series, the work of Ramsay Snow, which was immediately shown. I can understand trying to keep him under wraps for those who haven't read the books, to help keep one event of the third part a surprise, but it was some good characterization for the new character, and a solid introduction. I suspect that he will turn out to be the one who did it in later seasons, rather than the implication that it was Greyjoy's men, but this still annoys me.
In short, it's still good, it just has some flaws, which are far from ruining it.",1363824000,,1220,4.626728110599078

what I thought was totally unnecessary content. I'm no prude, by any means, but if this isn't the soft pornography,
I don't know what is. I'm not sure why an excellent story like this needed scenes of very graphic sex acts, including
acts of homosexuality, to enhance the story. They could have been much more subtle and made the same point. It has
actually turned me off to watch the rest of season 2. I'll probably make my way thru it as the Bluray was expensive,
but for those of you who don't find soft pornography ""enlightening"" you should pass on this. It adds nothing to the
story and is quite, in my opinion, cringe worthy.

Well acted, the dwarf, or ""imp"" character is an amazing actor, sets are wonderful, costumes great, and I like the story, but there are graphic
(soft porn) scenes of lesbian masturbation, oral sex, homosexual encounters, full frontal nudity, men included. This advances
nothing in the series and this content is in every episode that you will watch. I don't think I'll finish the series.

4923422,2,B0060MYM3S,"I loved Season One of Game of Thrones. I love the action/drama/mystery dimensions to it. I loved the fact that it was set in the 1100s or so.

I had a hard time with Season Two.

I had a hard time getting through Episode Two's various portrayals of incest. In fact, it made me angry how casually it made this portrayal. I decided to trudge on.

Big mistake! I was then bothered with the Sci Fi / Fantasy dimensions of the Qaarth people. Why bother with the ""magic"" and ""wizardry"" since it was all fake? To me, it really detracted from the realism of the main story.

I also thought the personification of the ""Black Death"" was pretty weak. Why throw in the kitchen sink when you already have such strong acting and such a compelling political and military struggle over on the ""island"" (whatever you call it).

I also thought that the Jon Snow story line was pretty weak and almost unworthy of being covered at all. I don't get why the Hill Peoples are at war with the ""southerners"" if they are also fighting the ""White Walkers.""

Anyway, I didn't even it make it that far. The Qaarth people were just too weird and it was making my head hurt. That's likely a big NO to Season 3, at least as far as ownership.

I thought, maybe I should just read the novels. But then I thought, maybe I would be better off reading a good history of the War of the Roses. That is what I think I am going to do.",1363737600,2,1393,4.233962264150944

DVD copy was on double sided discs. The use of those as a physical media will never get a perfect rating from me

The digital copy promoted that you could also redeem an ultraviolet copy of the show as well. I could not make this work. It's possible I erred somehow.

The only thing I hate is that they create these fascinating and charismatic characters and then just when you've come to like them, they get killed off.

This one was a treat in that it came with a DVD copy AND a digital download code to make sure I've got access to the show no matter where I'm at.

As far as the actual set is concerned, it's great, probably the most ambitious show HBO has put on in a long time, the quality of the transfer to Blu is great, the audio is fantastic and the extras are awesome if you don't have the books handy.",1363651200,,665,3.962686567164179

4923476,4,B0060MYM3S,"I have read all five of the books in the Song of Ice and Fire series, and I have now seen both of the first two seasons of this TV series.  I suppose I could complain, like so many of the book readers, that too many details have been altered to one degree or another or omitted entirely - why, for instance, did they cut Meera and Jojen Reed from the story?  Or what happened to Stannis Baratheon's wife (homely, humourless, introduced him to the religion of the fire god) and daughter (afflicted with greyscale, best and only friend is the foole they brought from across the Narrow Sea to entertain the court at Dragonstone)?  Why does Robb Stark go after an entirely different girl than the one in the books (and who doesn't actually appear until the third book, A Storm of Swords)?  And the scene with Joffrey having the two whores beat each other savagely - is this necessary, especially if we already understood the character to be cruel and capricious, like his mother and ""uncle""?

But what would be the point?  We all know that our favourite books, when made into movies or TV series, will be altered, sometimes for the better (Shawshank Redemption, where the story was made more concise, and Fight Club, where it was given more linear continuity, are two examples that spring to my mind) but usually for the perceived worse.  Grouse though we may, this is what happens.  I think we can learn to appreciate a well-done story, regardless of the changes.

And this one is pretty good, despite the changes I mentioned above.  The writers have still stuck mostly by the original story, easing back on the sometimes burdensome details George R.R. Martin included in the books.  The casting is impeccable - Peter Dinklage as Tyrion Lannister, for one, is absolutely perfect; Natalie Dormer plays Margaery Tyrell somewhat sexier than I'd pictured her in the books, but that makes her more appealing; Lena Headey really shines as Cersei Lannister - and the choice of shooting locations absolutely amazing.  Northern Ireland, of course, has been the stand-in for the North of Westeros; Iceland for the far North, beyond the Wall and to the Fist of the First Men; Dubrovnik, Croatia, has provided both King's Landing and some of the interior scenery of Qarth, with Morocco providing the deserts outside.  The story, of course, continues to be gripping, which makes me wonder how they're going to straighten up the narrative once they get to the fourth (A Feast for Crows) and fifth (A Dance With Dragons) books, where the continuity is stopped for a bit; half of ADWD takes place along AFFC's timeline (read Martin's notes in both books), so it's going to need to be tightened up considerably.  But I'm particularly looking forward to the third season, since the body count really soars in the third book and some drastic changes take place.  Onward!",1363564800,,2848,4.760162601626016

So story aside I will tell you that this season's blu-ray version is wonderful.  I haven't gotten into the commentary yet, but I can tell you one thing that makes these a ""must own"".  That one thing is the wonderful in episode guide.

Having read the books I know some of the back story, but it's great to be able to pull it up while you're watching to refresh yourself with where the characters are and who they are.  If that wasn't enough then you get the wonderful history or Westeros retold to you in these beautifully narrated shorts that are nothing short of wonderful.  Aside from the in episode guide, enough cannot be said about how beautiful the video transfer is.

I watch this show on my TV when it broadcasts on HBO, and it looks wonderful there.  A couple months later I get it on blu-ray and I don't know how they do it, but it looks even more visually stunning.  The colors pop, everything is crystal clear, and the blacks are to die for dark.  So what are you waiting for go ahead, and buy this on blu-ray.  If you don't have the first buy that one as well.",1363478400,,1174,4.243243243243243

4923500,3,B0060MYM3S,"Any TV show that you have to send your child out of the room in order to watch should give you pause. The first 2 episodes of the show were simply ridiculous. Every 15 minutes the drama, for what it was, completely ground to a halt in order to introduce the Bob Guccione Penthouse soft core porn scene, entirely inessential to the plot. In one case you had your now politically correct gay sex scene, in another your few rapes. At some point the directors and writers must have come to their senses because all the sex scenes disappeared - at the start of episode 3. At this point, naturally, the storyline, for what it is, began to improve. By episode 5 or 6 the show got dramatically better and by the end was excellent. But anyone hoping for a consistently excellent show ought to look elsewhere or at least have the patience to wade through the first few episodes. Personally speaking I enjoyed Pillars of the Earth (the TV show) much more. It has more drama, more energy, less inessential sex porn violence, and a more rational story line.",1363478400,4,1044,4.5

All ot it is so above fine! I even like all the blood! The horses are beautiful and I hope humaneley treated! The story, the acting! I actually believe that my girl-hero, Caleesi, is the Mother of Dragons! There are lessons to be learned, there is true heroism, there is scary magic. This is as epic as the Wizard of Oz and I probably haven't been as enthralled by a t.v. show since when I was four and wouldn't leave my grandma's house when The Wizard of Oz was on.

Many have said its not as good as season 1, but I disagree.  I don't want to give out any spoilers, but I will say that compared to season 1, It is maybe not as climactic, but season 2 does move the story forward, and fleshes out (literally and figuratively) the characters more.

I have gone through THREE sets of the standard DVD boxed set. Disc 1 and 2 all looked ok all 3 sets and played ok - maybe that is all they ever inspect! I have had problems with disc 5 in all 3 sets due to random defects that cause pixilation and hang to various degrees. First set by far the worst. Second set looked worse and played better, but still problems. Scratched and slubbed right out of the box. HBO should be ashamed and crack down on the manufacturer for such feeble quality control. Two sets some issue with disc 3 and 4, same story, defects. Defects are not repeatable between the sets so it's not the file they use to make the disc, it's pure and simple quality problem. You can see pits, slubs, scratches on the disks. Some still play but just look bad. Some look bad and have problems playing all the scenes. Third replacement set not a charm. Asking for my money back this time around. You buy a box set you want all the disks to work. Not loose in box either, just ---- right out of the factory. Patience exhausted here for now.

When you get your set check all 5 discs immediately, don't wait to look until you get to disc 5. Most problems I saw were in Blackwater Bay and Valer Morgulis, the final two episodes on disc 5. That's a high irritation factor as those are the climactic end of season episodes!

Amazon very good about replacement sets, but what is the point when underlying production run seems to be all bad. Just trading which scenes are damaged! Just can't watch one more replacement set to find more problems.",1362960000,9,1558,4.347079037800687

What more can be said?

I read books one and two. I've bought both series and other books about the series/ world of Fire and Ice.  I was a fan until now.

Great actors.  Great scenery.  Great sets.  Nice music.

Screen play for series two seemed like it was written by committee. I constantly felt like I was watching a movie trailer that happened to be about an hour long.

I'm ok with the violence.  It was ""realistic"" after all.

The sadistic/ masochistic scenes SUCK.  We have enough senseless violence against women in our world without having to have more of it on our television screens.

Useless scenes not in book 2 (the sadistic beating of that woman while Joffrey watched is one) were added when important scenes were left out.  (Daenerys freeing the slaves for one.)

My favorite part of book two in the House of the Undying Ones was painfully inadequate.  What a wonderful opportunity for a terrific artistic expression and HBO blew it.

Season One was fun.  Season Two wasn't.

Lastly,  HBO promised to ""do it right"" with its onscreen depiction of the Fire and Ice series.  With Series two, they forgot their promise.",1362873600,9,1209,4.6571428571428575

Here comes my complaint, the sixth book isn't due out until 2015.  Hey Martin!  If you're going to write such great stuff, could you light a fire under it please?

The downside is that I have to wait an entire year before getting to watch this amazing show. The upside is that the product is beautifully packaged and if you love the show, it becomes a valuable addition to your library.  Season Two was worth the long wait. I am also getting ready to rewatch Season 1, because Game of Thrones is not a story that you will want to read or watch only once. I was able to purchase Season Two from Amazon for 29.95, which is about the price of two months of an HBO subscription.

4923602,5,B0060MYM3S,"Both my father and my brother love ""Game of Thrones"". Personally, I completely missed the first season, but started watching the second. It took about five episodes of ""compulsory watching"", but then I was hooked! This series apparently slowly gets to you. And poisons you? I mean, it's all just a fictionalized account of the Early Middle Ages, with some Roman orgies thrown in for good measure. Or...? ;-)

It seems that the main weakness of the series (about a dozen story lines with characters whose number is legion) is also its biggest strength. It's difficult not to find *some* character that captivates you, if only for a couple of episodes. Even so, ""Game of Thrones"" probably wouldn't have worked without the previous success (until the last episode) of ""Lost"", which also had innumerable characters and a near-impenetrable plot.

Personally, I'm fascinated by Tyrion, the manipulative dwarf who is actually one of the good guys. His philosophy is to trick evil people into doing the right thing - somehow, that squares with my own view of politics. Arya is another interesting character, and then there's Daenerys Targaryen, Melisandre and her pseudo-Zoroastrian religion, and ""The Others"" beyond The Wall. (The Others are coming!) However, I readily admit that I can't make out all the Starks, Lannisters, Baratheons, mercenaries and prostitutes...yet.

Be that as it may, I will nevertheless award this quasi-high fantasy series five stars. But here's a prediction: George R. R. Martin will probably die before he finishes ""A Song of Ice and Fire"", making the last episode of ""Game of Thrones"" even less bearable than that of ""Lost"". All this will take place at some point in 2020.

The production values, acting, script, and overall maintainence of the integrity of the source material is still very satisfying.  Given the complexity of the books and the labyrinthine plot the writers do a very good job of telling all the sub plots clearly and making you care about even the most despicable of characters.  I'd love to see the ""extended"" cuts of all the episodes with all the scenes that were probably elimnated because of time contraints.  I only wish they had a way of linking/subtitling each storyline via a sort of ""calendar"" or dating the way Tolkien did in Lord of the Rings.  Then one could more clearly understand each event in a temporal context.  Such as:  Meanwhile across the sea, or a few weeks later, or the following spring...etc.  But I quibble.

The show is still one of the best available on cable right now though. The acting and effects are top notch, and despite a few unnecessarily drawn out parts, the plot moves along rather well.

In conclusion, book fans be aware this is not GRRM's Game of Thrones. HBO is making their own living breathing entity. It's like living in the alternate reality of a book you love. It's the same, but very different.",1362528000,,711,4.419847328244275
4923622,5,B0060MYM3S,I really liked the second season but as a person who has read all the books a couple parts really pissed me off where they left out entire MAIN characters like the Reed children and I won't spoil it for you but something that never took place in Quarth. I don't have HBO so I just wait for the series to come out but I remembered way back when the second series was premiering on HBO and my hairstylist said something about what happens to the mother of dragons in Quarth and I thought she was joking because that never happened in the books.,1362528000,,542,4.221153846153846

4923630,5,B0060MYM3S,"I'm a diehard GoT fan although I've not read all the books in the series (I finished the first three and haven't continued beyond that). I love the HBO series which I find to be the perfect culmination of excellent casting and plot, beautiful sets and cinematography, and a haunting score.
Since I don't subscribe to HBO, I waited almost a year for this series to be made available on DVD and I think it is worth all the wait.

Season 2 picks up where Season 1 left off, with political turmoil within the Seven Kingdoms being the backdrop. With regards to the books, this season dramatizes the events found in the second book of the series, i.e. A Clash of Kings (HBO Tie-in Edition): A Song of Ice and Fire: Book Two. One thing I have to mention here is that the series is not 100% faithful to the books but certainly worth appreciating on its own merits. I love the series for its strengths, independent of the novels. The series is to be commended for being able to capture the complexity of the inter-connected story lines, a spider's web of court intrigues, supernatural machinations, romance, and adventure, all of which commingle to provide viewers with one of the best small screen experiences ever. I consider GoT to the be one of the best TV series I've ever watched and certainly ranks as my all time favorite fantasy series.

Btw, for those (like me) who like to develop a better understanding of all the characters and their specific roles in the stories, then there are several sites that do a good job of providing all the relevant background information -

I received a free HD digital copy through Amazon because I bought the Blu-Ray season. Amazon.com is proving once again that it's Prime services will always be the better against the DRM filled and very much loathed by me iTunes. This season of Game of Thrones is probably the main reason I am never going to buy anything from iTunes ever again.

About the product: it is well made as the first season, however HBO decided to include a small case with 2 double sided DVDs with the season's 10 episodes, making the box thicker than season one's.

4923674,2,B0060MYM3S,"The first season was outstanding so I was looking forward to these episodes. However something has gone seriously wrong. I haven't read the books, so I can't say whether it is the source material or the adaptation, but this season bogs down into endless tte--tte discussions about past lovers, current lovers, future lovers, their disappointment in children, how they have been treated by siblings, and what they feel about their fathers. Sort of a ""Days of Our Medieval Lives"" soap opera.

In addition, the plot jerks forward through an endless series of improbable coincidences and fantastically unlikely events. This is deus ex machina operated in assembly line fashion. It actually gets dreadfully predictable. At one point the Night Watch patrol is digging in the snow, and there is a metallic clang. I turned to my wife and said ""time for them to find a relic of the First Men"". The characters cleaned snow from a large inscribed disk, and the first line spoken was, ""That's the mark of the First Men!"".

Characters are able to lead small bands through hundreds of miles of enemy territory just so they can meet to talk about their fathers. In the last episode, characters hiding in a besieged castle come out after the siege is ended and instead of finding the victorious army in the city or camped around it, no one is in sight. Everyone has gone home (probably because of sequestration) and so they tramp off to the north.

With so much of the time spent on meetings and discussions, I thought perhaps they had engaged David Weber (Mr. Roberts Rules of Order) as a script writer. But no, it is a junior Ms. Roberts Rules of Order who bears this responsibility.",1362268800,3,1669,4.748275862068965

The Blu-Ray's were fine and all of them played perfectly; the digital code was also included so no problem there. The DVD set was the issue as both disks were marked up and disk one had several deep scratches. The display box that the disks sit in has damage as well. The corners were all nicked up and had paper peeling away from the cardboard around the edges.

Amazon's packaging was perfect as usual, so it must be a factory issue considering the DVD's were sealed and scratched inside the shrink wrap. This is actually the 2nd HBO set I've bought that's had damage to the display box and inner cardboard, but the first with disk issues.

Also, there was no order summary with the shipment. There were 2 items in the order which arrived on time, but this is the first time there was no packing slip. Weird.

That said, I love this series. Hate that HBO waits until the new episodes are about to start before they release the previous season on disk.",1362182400,,477,4.230769230769231

4923688,5,B0060MYM3S,"Many times over the years I have been dissapointed when I read a good book and later saw the movie.  The director had a much different intrepretation than I had.  This is not the case with ""Game of Thrones"".  It is very well done and true to the books.  There are so many plot lines and characters they can't possible go into the depths the written word can.  Having read the books I have a better understanding of what  is happening on the screen.  Knowing ahead of time what is going to happen doesn't spoil it for me in the least.",1362182400,,533,4.217821782178218

I had thought the five books was the entire series only to realize upon starting the fifth book, there were going to be two more.  I was very impressed that the TV series was so honest to the written word and I enjoyed it very much.",1362182400,,297,4.016949152542373
4923690,5,B0060MYM3S,"I'll be the first to admit, I have not read the books (yet).  So as an outsider, I must say that this adaptation is a masterpiece.  Unlike with the Harry Potter franchise, where major plot elements are left unexplained in the adaptation, no such thing happens here.  This series doesn't feel like it's a summary of a book; rather, it feels as though it naturally belongs in this treatment.  I preordered the Blu-Ray Set through Wal-Mart (sorry, Amazon) for 35 dollars; however, even if it had costed the normal 50 dollars, it would have been a great deal.

The picture is beautiful; the soundtract, stunning as always.  The special features are a nice add-on (particularly the Histories and Lore on disk 5).  It is obvious that this season was given a substantially higher budget than season 1, as evidenced by the battle scenes and visual effects.  The new characters like Stannis Baratheon and Balon Greyjoy are well portrayed and are quickly acclimated into this fantasy world.

I won't give too much away, but I will say this: fans of Tyrion Lannister, will like this season a lot, as he has replaced Ned Stark as the show's most central character (if you can say there is one).  Peter Dinklage is an amazing actor, and you really get to see him shine in this season.

Furthermore, the digital download code allows for downloading over a variety of formats including itunes and Ultraviolet.  However, I strongly suggest downloading over Amazon instead of itunes (though my guess is if you have an ipad, this will fall on deaf ears).  This will allow you to have it saved in the cloud permanently, so you can delete it off of your computer/tablet to free up space and re-download it later.  You can also stream it.  Additionally, you are permitted to redeem an additional copy of the season over Flixter.

The season also includes DVDs, which are a nice bonus, though I doubt they will see much use, as the HD quality really shows with the blu-ray.

One more thing.  I think this goes without saying, but just in case.  Do NOT start the series with season 2!  This is not Big Bang Theory or How I Met Your Mother.  Watch the episodes from the beginning and IN ORDER.  You will not have a clue what's going on otherwise.",1362096000,,2222,4.614795918367347

Talisa, Ros the whore, every one of Dany's scenes as well as that House of the Undying scene) & also I discovered, when I was watching the Dragonstone featurette, that Disc 5 of the BD was scratched so it skips which sucks because it was the first thing I watched from the BD set.",1362096000,3,539,4.510204081632653

4923698,4,B0060MYM3S,"I am a HUGE fan of the first season of Game of Thrones, as well as the entire book series. I waited almost 2 years to order this as I no longer got HBO. I have watched season one at least, and not kidding, 50 times since I bought it. I recommend it to EVERYONE, gushing about the amazing story lines and characters and the genius of George R R Martin as a writer.

HOWEVER, season 2 SUCKED. Not nearly the depth of the first season, and even the actors that stayed are not as true to life. The story line is choppy, with soooo many IMPORTANT scenes missing from the books as well as adding long, boring scenes that weren't in them and make no lasting impression. Leaving out important secondary characters and missing whole scenes that I feel were necessary to the the tale was a mistake. That kept this season from being as full and rich and complete as the first.

Sorely disappointed. If I could send a movie back because I didn't like it, I would.

CORRECTION: I HAVE WATCHED THIS SEVERAL TIMES NOW, AND SEPARATED MY FEELINGS FOR THE BOOK FROM MY FEELINGS FROM THE MOVIES. THIS ACTUALLY IS A GREAT SEASON, IT JUST INCLUDES SEVERAL LONG AND BORING EXTRA SCENES AND IGNORES OTHER ACTUAL IMPORTANT PARTS OF THE STORY.

From the very first episode I was hook and decided to read the books. It is more than a fantasy story. It is about human nature as all good stories are. There are good characters and there are bad characters, but good and evil have never been as black and white as more shallow stories have portrayed. This is what I like about it. The good guys have bad, even disgusting aspects to their nature. The bad guys have good and even honorable values. They only difference between many of the characters is simply the side fate has landed them on. This makes the story very real to life. Of course, I also like the depth of the plot, which cannot really be told fully in the TV series, the richness of the world with all of its history, and the terror of the white walkers.

4923710,1,B0060MYM3S,"Foremost - before you purchase this POS I urge you to see the first episode on the first disk by way of NetFlix or Amazon to confirm that which I write next.

The costumes, dress, are good.  The sets are just ""good""  Lots of close ups so you don't get a feel for any width or depth.  The directing, to the extent it exists, is good.  And the goodness stops there.

First, the dialogue is mumbled.

Second, the dialogue is mumbled in a Scottish or Irish brogue.

Third, there are as many plots and subplots as there are arrows in the air in a battle.  it is like watching a tv series on steroids at the end of season 4 or 5 ... .. except you can't understand the dialogue to figure out who's doing what to whom, where, or why.

Fourth the directing is of no moment because in each scene (a collection of usually three people) each actor delivers their one-liner twice, and then the scene switches.  No width or depth.

Fifth, the box set includes a large map.  However, you need a magnifying glass to read the tiny tortured print.  It is like mumbling.
- and looses a great opportunity to convey a great deal of information.

Addendum:
After having seen all the episodes modification is in order.  The worst of the episodes about which I whine is the First Episode directed by Alan Taylor.  The remaining episodes are far better in content, audibility, and continuity.  There are lapses.  The map is still garbage.

Not only do you get the high quality blu-ray version with a plethora of special features, but this also comes with the entire season on DVD as well as a code for the digital copy.

This solves that problem, which is great for people that have multiple tv's but only one blu-ray player or perhaps people that have dvd players at work and are allowed to bring in entertainment while on shift.  I have noticed that some people have complained about not recieving the code for the digital copy.  I did notice that the portion of the package that houses the dvd's also has ""& digital copy"" printed on it, yet the code was located inside the blu-ray disc package with the rest of the paper booklets and advertising that accompanies this set.

Pros:
Very noticeable increase in production budget, scenes are grander and the Dire wolves are done right!
Several scenes not in the book add to the character depth
Wonderful immersive story
Salidor San was casted perfectly

Cons
Some parts it deviates much from the book, Stanis' family, the faith of Davis, and the continues relationship of renley- all go away from the book which is a disappoi ntment
It does feal a bit rushed as well fitting a 40+ hour book into a 10 hour season will cause that

The actors throughout are well chosen and impressive, with particular kudos to Sean Bean as Eddard Stark and Peter Dinklage as Tyrion Lannister.  Worldwide film locations are astoundingly beautiful.  The script writing and production team of David Benioff and D.B. Weiss are capturing the mood and tone of the novels well, moving the quite elaborate plot forward in an entertaining fashion without missing or altering much detail from G.R.R. Martin's books.

Only gripe is that the film production is a bit more raunchy with the sex and nudity than it needs to be, but this is inline with the books, I suppose.

This is the treatment that The Lord of the Rings deserved.  Several years of high production value one hour televsion series.  I hope to see that some day, still.  The reason being, is that this allows for the capturing of much more detail and to remain more faithful to the books.  That isn't to say that Peter Jackson's 3 film adaptation of The Lord of the Rings wasn't well done or enjoyable....and I hear that the 3 films slated to cover The Hobbit will delve into the Silmarillion and flesh out the backstory of the ressurection of Sauron....which is nice.  (Though I can do without the gimmicky 3D nonsense).

Well done.  Highly recommended.",1361750400,,1415,4.754098360655738
4923742,5,B0060MYM3S,What an amazing show. I'm addicted to every second of it. All the characters are so well played. I watched this entire season in 1 day. Hoping for many seasons to come.,1361750400,,168,4.28125

My Blu-ray player is from 2010.  Maybe it requires an update but I don't have the motivation so I returned this Blu-ray boxset.

Long story short: open the cardboard shipping box in a way that you can reuse it in case you find yourself returning the boxset",1361750400,8,419,4.52
4923744,5,B0060MYM3S,"I'm not going to go into details on the storyline itself in this review, but I will stress that you really should see the first season of Game of Thrones or read the books before you start on this one. This series is very serialized, with one episode containing vital information for the next one. This isn't a show you can just start on any random episode with. That said, the story is wonderfully detailed with a completely engrossing world and is definitely worth your time to get into. This season ups the action with a few episodes and deepens certain character relations even better than the books do. This DVD set is worth picking up for the story alone.

The DVD set itself is also a fine part of any fan's collection. This season set is similar to the first season set, where there is a slipcover with a nice raised picture on the front with the show's title. The DVDs themselves are protected by a sturdy box with the title and the sigils of the main houses of Westeros printed on one side. The Iron Throne is printed on the other. Inside the box, the insert unfolds into six panels with pictures of major characters on the outside. There is also a pocket with the standard HBO ads, coupons for their store, and sweepstakes entry. Most importantly, they decided to tuck in an episode guide that folds out to a serviceable map of Westeros and Essos. The writing is a little small and difficult to read, but it's come in handy for me when I'm trying to explain the world to someone who hasn't read the books.

The special features are high quality as well. Readers and show-watchers alike will appreciate the character profiles. Most of interest to me were the 12 audio commentary tracks, each with enlightening and entertaining features. Last year we found out about the George W. Bush head used as a prop in one of these commentaries. I look forward to finding out what details people get interested in from this set. I mainly loved the young actors beatboxing over the theme song.

The bottom line? Buy this DVD set. You get a good deal from Amazon and a really excellent show to add to your collection.",1361750400,2,2114,4.514360313315927

I think this show is much better not having read the books since i have no idea whats coming, Im just watching it play out. ill read the books when the show is done to see whats different. but this season packed a way bigger punch than the first, the wolfs are big as hell(but id like to see them kill more), the dragons have arrived(all though very small at this point), john gos over the wall, bran has become a very interesting and most likely powerfull character, there is quit a bit of magic in this season, the special effects look great and last but not least we get our first look at the white walkers(and they don't dissapoint). so i cant wait for the third season to start and everybody go buy this one its better than any movie your going to watch.",1361750400,,949,4.191256830601093
4923746,4,B0060MYM3S,"I have enjoyed watching Games of Thrones Season 2, but I must say I was quite surprised to have finished the entire 2nd season in one Sunday afternoon sitting and watching each blu-ray disc back to back (5 disk (10 episodes)).  All episodes are just too short and so many intrigues, actions, plots, schemes are omitted from many episodes of season 2, A Clash of Kings, that I was/am just sorely unhappy about this HBO Game of Thrones 2nd season.

Because HBO/GRRM casted Renly Baratheon as a gay king romantically involved with Loras Tyrell there really was no room for the episode to depict Brianne the Beauty's extreme secret love for King Renly Baretheon to the point that she disguised herself as Renly during Stannis' ground attack against Casterly Rock, and exacted vengeance on Stannis while he fought Tyrion & the Lannisters aptly dealing a great blow to Stannis and contributing to his losing the land battle to overtake the castle.  That the men who'd left Renly to fight for Stannis after Renly's death thought he (Renly) had returned from the dead (it was Brianne) to lead them and they turned on Stannis and slew many of his bannermen.

Why was the part when Tyrion used massive chains to close up the outer harbor (from beneath the sea) that lead into and out of castle waters, and trapped Stannis' ships in that harbor at castle during the sea battle with no way to escape the wildfire, left out?  There was no need to omit this important battle strategy that revealed Tyrion as superior battle tactician (planning and bravery).

The episode that depicted Jon and the Qhorin Halfhand was so short and choppy that it would be hard for anyone who had not read the novels to know that it was their (Jon and Qhori'sn) plan to have Halfhand and Jon intentionally fallout and fight and that Jon was to kill the Halfhand in combat to get closer to Mance and his free people beyond the Wall and learn their plans.

Daenery's trip to the House of the Undying was just too short and omitted her search through many doors having many experiences before she finally happened upon her dragons having them burn the entire House of the Undying down.

Don't get me started on Sansa's, Arya's, (Gentry's) Rob's, Bran/Richon's stories and how much is just left out from what's given us of them in A Clash of Kings novel.

HBO & GRRM stop lessening/shorting stories of ASOIAF episodes because you can and still achieve thrilling stories that are good, but not great as is all stories as they are depicted in the novels!",1361750400,,2515,4.659142212189616

Season Two is equally complex with new characters added and old ones more fully developed.

The second season is well worth owning if you want to see more of the saga from the first season.  If you are new to the series or haven't seen the first season in awhile I suggest you see the first season first.  I watched this straight through after year since viewing the first season and found myself wishing I had went back and watched the first season before starting.  This is complex story with pieces and moves like a chess game, but of course even the best layed moves can be foiled by outside forces.  The addition of magic, undead, and dragons adds to the tapestry it weaves.  If you enjoy complex dramas with some medieval fantasy you will probably like it.

4923769,5,B0060MYM3S,"Who ever HBO gets to design their Season Box set of this show is awesome. Like the previous set of Season 1 we get the episode guide/Disc Menu guide and all the content on one side with a giant map of Westeros on the other that was taken from the books only with color and full size map and not 2-3 pages of different maps. So kuddos.

The next improvement is with the menus themselves on the discs. Season 1 you go to the extras or the episode menu and it would show the full season list of the show for each episode but obviously you can't access all these episodes on a single disc, even on a Blu Ray disc. Same with extras. What I didn't like from before was never any real clue as to what specific disc held what extras. I had to drag out the menu guide and look at each disc to see which ones had commentary, what extras were on what.

Now, you go into the menu and each extra is given a disc number to tell us the viewer where that specific extra is. Love it when it makes navigation more easy to understand. I'm not saying I'm too lazy to do all that, if push comes to shove I'll do all that to see what is where, but it's nice when the people making the menus put in these nice little touches.

Now I haven't watched all the episodes yet, I'm only about half way to 3/4 of the way through but so far the show is still just as fantastic as when I saw it air on TV.

I also am happily surprised at the large number of commentary tracks added on compared to Season 1. There are even multiple tracks for some episodes. One is director/writer/crew commentary (mostly David Benioff and D. B. Weiss) and the other is the cast commentary. And of course George R.R. Martin himself gets his own commentary track for Blackwater, the episode he wrote himself. Which is another reason why I love this show over other book adapted TV shows or even films is this show actually allowed the author himself to contribute in some meaningful way to the show. He doesn't have complete authority over the show but the show creators respect his input. And again, he got it in his contract to be allowed to write an episode per season.

Once again too, Peter Dinklage steals the show again with Maisie Williams a close second for actors who really know how to play these characters to the sheer limit.

Now I got to wait for Season 3 to come out. I'm not gonna say what will happen (I've read and own the books) but I've a feeling its gonna be even bigger and more awesome then before and this show has gotten pretty big and awesome already.",1361664000,2,2526,4.208677685950414
4923770,3,B0060MYM3S,"I spent the extra $4 for the blu-ray/DVD/Digital copy for both the DVD and digital copies.  The DVD copies are two double-sided discs that play OK in my portable DVD player, but I'd have preferred four or five single sided discs just to minimize the possibility of damaging a disc during use.  The digital copy doesn't play in my mac on iTunes after almost 5 hours to download the entire set.  Apparently I need a monitor that is HDCP compatible.  How I fix that on a laptop I'll take up with my Apple dealer.  My iPod isn't capable either, though I'd die from eye strain watching it on a 1.5 inch screen.  I don't own an iPad so I'm not sure if the problem goes away with them.  I like the series, and I'll enjoy the blu-ray at home, but it would have been nice to take it with me on travels and thats why I'm glad it wasn't that much more for something I really didn't receive.",1361577600,2,879,4.196428571428571
4923771,4,B0060MYM3S,"The show itself is marvelous. Definitely seek out the discs or download through iTunes.

I'm a long time Amazon Prime member, but I will never buy another Amazon Instant movie or TV show again. I have a new iMac, 40mps internet connection, Netflix Instant, iTunes, and Hulu and NONE of those ever pause or show lower resolution. But I can't even try to watch Game of Thrones Season 2 again, as just watching (or trying to watch) the first two episodes has resulted in the player pausing every few minutes, and then jumping to a different part of the show when I finally get it to resume playback. The pop-out player shows captions that I can't turn off (and looking over the forum threads I'm far from alone in this) and the quality of the stream keep bouncing to very high compression for no good reason. Again, I stream Netflix nearly every day and have yet to encounter a fraction of the problems I'm having with this one program. I've tried multiple browsers, an iPad and my PS3 and none of them resulted in anything but frustration.

At this late date, Amazon has no excuse to be so far behind the field, especially when you cannot get a refund for their terrible service. Shame on me for buying the full season upfront.

UPDATE: April 4, 2013.

Amazon apparently just read my review, contacted me to let me know that there were problems with the show files on their end, refunded my money AND send ""new copies"" of Season 2 to my instant account.

THIS is how you do customer service. They can't give me back my frustrated weekend, but they can make sure that I'll still be a satisfied Amazon customer, and earn another chance at their service. I've bumped up the review to 4 stars (instead of the original 2) to reflect my satisfaction.  Their response is below:

""I am sorry that you have had a bad experience with Amazon and streaming our Game of Thrones Season 2 videos from Amazon Instant Video.

I am contacting you to let you know we hear your voice and we are prepared to do something about this horrible viewing experience with us. I have went through and refunded your money for this video seeing as how you were not able to view it at the quality that it should have been at. We pride ourselves on the quality of our videos and we will make sure we do better in getting a video to you with higher quality.

It seems that we had issues with the Game of Thrones at the time that you had issues with playing it and it was the file it self which was giving you the errors. We apologize deeply for this issue and I hope you can give us a second chance at making things right.""",1361577600,26,2587,4.372916666666667

4923773,5,B0060MYM3S,"My wife and I love Game Of Thrones and it is one of the best shows on TV.  We could hardly wait for this second season to come out on DVD because we enjoy the show so much that once we start watching the series we cannot stop until we are done.  The season was very good and there was a lot of action, particularly in the last two episodes.

This season spends a lot of time building on the plot and the inter relationships between the characters.  I won't go into the story line and give any spoilers, but let's just say that it was fun to watch.  My wife loved it and she gave it a solid 5 stars.  I thought it needed some more action in the early part of the season and that the last two episodes were spectacular. The acting was exceptional and the story just keeps you on the edge of your seat waiting for the next thing to happen.

While I love all of the characters, even the evil and the good, I particularly like Tyrion Lannister (Peter Dinklage) as this role is just special.  He possibly plays the smartest character and the best leader out of the bunch who are vying to be king and yet no one considers him to possibly be the king because of his size.

This season is fast moving with old characters making great strides in achieving their goals in the war and new characters coming into the story.  It is a great show with good cinematography, acting and storyline and it is enjoyable to watch.

This is another wonderful HBO hit series!",1361577600,,1450,4.217391304347826
4923774,5,B0060MYM3S,The first word that comes to mind is the word riveting.  I can't wait for Season 3.  Money very well spent.,1361577600,,107,4.0476190476190474
4923775,5,B0060MYM3S,"The second season of ""Game of Thrones"" shows us the chaos that results in the execution of Eddard Stark and the death of King Robert Baratheon; ""King"" Joffrey finds challenges from Stark's son, Baratheon's two brothers and the threat of Daenerys Targaryen with her infant dragons overseas. Only Tyrion Lannister (Emmy award winner Peter Dinklage)seems to have his wits about him enought o try and restrain the sadistic stream that Joffrey demonstrates.

The second season receives a stunning transfer for Blu-ray. Blacks are rock solid throughout. This is a nearly flawless presentation in terms of the quality of the video and is presented in 1080p, AVC encoded transfer (1.78:1). Audio sounds terrific as well with an active surround mix even during the subtle, dialog driven scenes.

I have read about some issues with the packaging on this set here from other reviews but, aside from minor scuffs on the enclosed extra DVDs/digital copies (which are dual-sided and, let's be honest, most fans HATE dual sided DVD's)which are packaed in their own cardboard container, the set I received had all the discs and there was no problem playing any of the discs. I wonder if having BD-Live enabled MAY play a role in the issues with some of these discs playing (as that has been an issue before with some discs).

Having said that, though, it might be wise to take a look (briefly so that if you haven't seen the entire series before you avoid spoilers)and briefly play all of your discs to make sure there aren't any issues.

The special features are terrific and include the following commentary tracks:

""The North Remembers"" - Executive Producers/Writers David Benioff and D.B. Weiss
""The Night Lands"" - Alfie Allen (Theon Greyjoy) and Gemma Whelan (Yara Greyjoy)
""What Is Dead May Never Die"" - Writer Bryan Cogman and Director Alik Akharov with a secondary commentary track with Sophie Turner (Sansa Stark), Maisie Williams (Arya Stark), and Isaac Hampstead Wright (Braan Stark)
""Garden of Bones"" - Carice Van Houten (Melisandre) and Liam Cunningham (Davos Seaworth)
""The Old Gods and the New"" - Kit Harington (Jon Snow), Rose Leslie (Ygritte), and Co-Executive Producer/Writer Vanessa Taylor
""A Man Without Honor"" - Executive Proudcers/Writers David Denioff and D.B. Weiss
""The Prince of Winterfell"" - Nikolaj Coster-Waldau (Jaime Lannister) and Michelle Fairley (Catelyn Stark)
""Blackwater"" - Co-Executive Producer/Author of Game of Thrones, George R.R. Martin / Commentary 2 with Peter Dinklage (Tyrion Lannister), Lena Headey (Cersei Lannister), and Director Neil Marshall
""Valar Morghulis"" - Rainer Gombos and Steve Kullback of the Visual Effects Team along with a secondary commentary track featuring Emilia Clarke (Daenerys Targaryen) and Director Alan Taylor

The quality of the commentary tracks vary a bit and, to be honest, I haven't had time to listen to all of them yet particularly the multiple commentary tracks but the three or so I've listened to have been pretty informative and provide interesting background including changes from George R. R. Martin's novel.

Other special features include character bios presented with interviews of the various cast members, ""In Episode Guides"" which give fans (both those who have read and haven't read the novels) background on Martin's universe as portrayed in that particular episode and a terrific featurette on the Battle of Blackwater Bay.

Additional extras include ""War of the Five Kings"" a featurette on those vying for the thorne as well as ""Game of Thrones Inner Circle"" a great roundtable discussion between the producers/writers and cast members about the evolution of the series and characters.

""Religions of Westeros"" gives us the motivation behind the action for some of the factions in the show. There are also a number of ""Dragon"" eggs and I haven't found them all just yet.

Winding things up is a fold out booklet that tells us about the various characters, factions on the show which also includes episode information.

The set is handsomely packaged in a box and the Blu-rays are in an accordian style fold-out holder with, as mentioned, the DVD/digital copies housed in a separate cardboard container.

The second season of ""Game of Thrones"" continues to be as challenging, involving and intriguing as the first with some unexpected plot developments. For those who have read the novels there may be some disappointment over how the battle on the bay is presented or the briefer presentation of Jon Snow and his ""captive"" wilding but, over all, this is still a terrific presentation of a terrific show.

""THEY WERE NOT"", Your ""MUST BUY THIS SET FROM AMAZON"".
This set of Amazon's not only includes Blu-Ray, DVD and Digital Copy but the ""BEST PART"" is that it Includes ""EXCLUSIVE BLU-RAY FEATURES"", Interactive looks at the ""Wars of the Five Kings"", ""Histories and Lore"", ""In-Episode Guide"", and what I am excited about the most, ""Hidden Dragon Eggs"" (they state it uncovers never seen before content).
There are even extras:
Experience the ""Creating of the Battle of Black Water Bay"", ""The Religion of Westeros"", ""Audio Commentaries"" ( w/ 12 Cast and Crew including our FAVORITE ACTORS and last what they call the ""Inner-Circle of Game of Thrones"", which are where 5 of our favorite actors speak of their experiences while shooting the Second Season, in a roundtable discussion.
Last but not least, it gives you the ""7 New Profiles"".  Uh! Oh!, Let me say, the new actors better ""bring it on"", even though I hate that saying, but, because we lost so many of our favorite actors ""The First Season"".  These new guys better make us fall in love fast given that we, as the watchers, were not only shocked but even heart broken over ""The First Season"" actors.
Good thing HBO had a great final episode for 'The First Season"", otherwise, I would not have been as thrilled about ""The Second Season"".
""HBO"", knows what they are doing when it comes to their Series shows, being that I am a ""True Blood"" lover too.
That being said so does ""Amazon"", when it comes to just about ""EVERYTHING""!!  But of course their ""Movie/DVD"" sales and options.
So by saying all the above, it is all said by just looking and reading the differences between these two sets.

The quality of the writing, acting, along with the elaborate sets and story line make it one of the best shows in years.  Perhaps not since ""Rome"" has HBO released such a compelling drama that seems more like a movie each episode than a show.  I can only hope that ""Game of Thrones"" is not prematurely canceled due to high production costs, like ""Rome"" was in the past, despite high viewership.

That being said, as a regular viewer of this show, I was disappointed with the extras on the Blu-Ray.  There is the commentary included on every episode and a decent amount of featurettes, but beyond that not too much.  Most of the interviews with cast and character biographies are very short in length as well.  In addition, there is a guide that you can have added to each episode, but if you watch the show regularly it really doesn't help much and blocks the screen.  I really hoped for more behind the scenes footage and other creative bonus feature ideas from HBO.

4923810,5,B0060MYM3S,"These are my overall impressions. I haven't read the books in awhile, so take that into account.
First, it should be obvious that you really need to either have seen season one or read the first book before watching this season.

I didn't think this season was that much worse than season one. However, there is a decline in the quality of the acting simply because we lost two great actors in season one and the several new actors don't measure up:
Boring new actors: those playing the roles of Stannis and ""Yara""(Asha).
Okay new actors: those playing the roles of Margery Tyrell, Davos, Melisandre, Balon Greyjoy (Theon's father), Craster, Talisa (a character invented for the show, Robb's love interest this season - takes the place of Jeyne Westerling), Jaqen, Ygritte, Xaro, Brienne (is she only 6' 3""? They make her look 7 feet tall), Pyat Pree
Outstanding new actors: none

I didn't have any major problems with the actors of season one, only how their characters were written (for example, Cersei was too nice in season one. She gets meaner in this season.)
Littlefinger - almost too nasty this season. Well, alright, season one firmly established him as one of the bad guys.
Theon - People who haven't read the books will be confused by him. In season one, he appeared to be completely loyal to the Starks. Now, he is shown to be otherwise. I've read 4 out of 5 of the books at least twice each and still don't get his character. Does ""selfish traitor"" cover it, or is there more to him?
Jorah Mormont- looking too old to be a potenetial love interest for Dany.
Old Man Mormont on the Wall - not as respectable as in the books.
Pycelle - the writers messed up the ""manhood"" joke.
Arya - too old to pass for a boy.

Other reviewers have noted the various discrepancies between the novels and the series. These may not be large enough to damage the story, but since we don't have the entire story yet, it's too early to tell.

Features on the 5 Bluray discs
(I haven't gone through all of these, so my advise is to avoid them until you've seen the episodes, to avoid spoilers.)
-19 ""animated"" (motion comic style) history clips-these are about 2-5 minutes long and are told from the viewpoint of individuals characters, with their biases. This helps give the viewers who haven't read the books (or those of us who need a refresher) a lot of back history that they couldn't cram into the episodes. To unlock these, you have to play the episode through; if you fast-forward through the episode you won't be able to watch them. This feature is part of the
-an In Episode guide, which also gives you brief descriptions of the characters in the scene you're watching, as well as showing where (on a tiny map) the scene is taking place.
-War of the Five Kings- an interactive guide to the ins and outs of the war
-Hidden ""Dragon"" eggs- So far, four of these have been discovered- each containing a deleted scene
-12 commentaries
-The Religions of Westeros- Martin and the writers discuss these for 7 1/2 minutes
-Game of Thrones Inner Circle- roundtable discussion between 4 of the actors, Benioff, and Weiss
-Creating the Battle of Blackwater Bay-
-History and Lore- the 19 animated history clips all in one place

Features on the 2 double-sided DVD discs
-None. All the special features in this set are on the Bluray discs.

Also included: A fold-out map showing the ENTIRE Game of Thrones world.
-A digital copy authorization code.

And, if you buy the set from the same massive chain store I did, it comes with an additional disc with one 20 minute clip on the special effects

There's a scary little slip of paper that warns that there may be playing issues if your Bluray firmware hasn't been updated, but so far I haven't had any problems, except for the amount of time it takes for the disc to start playing.",1361404800,,3817,4.586510263929619

Besides the bluray disks & the double sided DVD's you get ONE code that works with itunes AND either Amazon Instant, Vudu, or Flixster (Ultraviolet).

Note: sign up/in at Flixster/UV and then LINK your VUDU account.  This allows you to get the 1080p copy onto your PS3 and still keep it stored in the cloud that is UV/Flixster.

I do not keep anything in Amazon's cloud (yet) but the option is there for you.

summary: Season2 is on my apple tv [iCloud](1080p/720p), and its also in the Vudu cloud (1080p) so I can watch it on my PS3.

sadly, the box does not state this nice 2 way digital copy code, but its all in there, which is nice that HBO realizes that people might want to watch it on a computer, iOS device, or PS3 AND gives you this flexibility.

4923823,5,B0060MYM3S,"There are plenty shows that I love and are completely brilliant, and I can't say I spend all my time around GOT. However, GOT is the best show I have ever seen. The level of quality this show maintains is spectacular.

The writing and story: Inspired by George R. R. Martin's ""A Song of Fire and Ice series,"" GOT revolves around a very creative and captivating world. I have yet to read the series, so I can't speak directly for its staying true to the series. Although, from what I have heard, it stays true. I also know that the author is active in the show and has even written some of the episodes. My point being, its a creative bombshell of a show. But beyond creativity, the writing, the dialog itself is fantastic. The most disappointing thing a great creative show can do is have poor dialog. It needs to be compelling yet realistic, and this show does not fail at either. Creativity and good dialogue, that is one of the most important characteristic to a great show.

And of course the acting: For a creative and well written script to be successfully it needs good casting and talented actors and actresses. The cast is fantastic. There are some known faces and some unknown. However, even the smallest of parts do their characters justice. And there are those that excel even more than most.

Lastly, a show has to be visually stimulating. A good show needs good special effects and directing. GOT is filmed in various locations in Europe; I don't know exactly where. The locations engulf you into the world of GOT, and leave you begging for more.

Now this is the second season, so I suppose I should talk about how has progressed. I thought it was just as good as the first season. In fact, I thought it was better, but that is mostly because I like the direction it is going becoming more magical. Of course its more than that. Its the politics mixed with a creative world of wonder that never ceases to amaze.

Oh, and a quick word about the packaging. Naturally, the amazon packaging was efficient enough. The Blu-ray package is beautiful. The cardboard cover has an image of the iconic golden crown. It evens includes a level of texture to the embroidery of the crown, which is nice touch. I also think the image is a better representation of what the show is about than that of the first season. Of course that's just my opinion.

SPOILER-SKIP TO NEXT PARAGRAPH IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE FIRST SEASON--The first season showed Eddard Stark. He was a major character, but I figured being represented on the cover made him pretty damn important therefore safe. Well, imagine my denial and shock upon his death. Of course, that just speaks to the shows compelling writing.

Anyways, the crown shows the main conflict that this show revolves around.

Now, as for the rest of the packaging, it was clean and seemed to be secure. The Blu-ray cardboard case did have a line along the spine like it was folded before it had even been opened. It was caused by the pocket where slips of info were stored which caused it to deform. It wasn't major but noticeable. Still not worth more than half a star on a 5 star scale.

I also want to add how great a value this is. With a DVD, digital, and Ultraviolet copies in addition to the Blu-ray. At $30, its even cheaper than the DVD copy. it

And here is a TIP to amazon buyers:
when you go to the website to get the digital copy, select amazon. It will then produce a code (different from slip provided) to which you go to Amazon and redeem it.

4923826,4,B0060MYM3S,"I feel as if a 4-star review is necessary for what was still a very enjoyable season of Game of Thrones, if only to drive home the point that there was a lot to be disappointed about in Season 2.  Spoiler alert - The absence of a Ned Stark-like character as a central point of reference leaves the story chasing after several different narratives.  While the acting is generally quite good (Peter Dinklage remains excellent), it can be quite jarring to hop from story-to-story, all while introducing several new characters.

Much of Season 2 culminates in the naval/land battle in the penultimate episode, which was outstanding.  When Game of Thrones is at its best, it's the closest thing to a summer action blockbuster you'll see on network or cable TV.  But if every episode were like that one, HBO would go bankrupt.  As such, much of Season 2 was spent following Emilia Clarke trying to find her dragons, or watching scenes with heavy dialogue as the writers tried to develop characters 8 minutes at a time out of a 60-minute episode.

Still a great show, but the writing lacked the focus of the very excellent Season 1.  Much of that may be due to the source material, but it's still the job of the writers to apply that material (or deviate) from it in a manner necessary to fill a compressed 10-episode season of television.",1361232000,3,1332,4.638297872340425

I would if I hadn't read all the books YEARS ago and already know exactly what happens.
Still, I think there's been some truly bad casting to this series.
I suppose HBO was trying to keep it on the cheap, so had to settle for what was in the budget and got several budget actors.
Sean Bean, the most accomplished actor and no doubt, highest priced, was killed off in the first season.
Lena Heady is all wrong for Cersei.
Never heard of nor seen any other single actor in the series. Hence the cheap casting.
I'll admit the scene settings and costumes are good, but I find nothing special in any of the acting.
If you've read the books, don't expect much more than a mediocre showing.

4923833,4,B0060MYM3S,"A Clash of Kings is not my favorite book in the Ice and Fire saga, in fact besides A Feast for Crows it is the weakest book in the series, even still I was excited about this season of Game of Thrones. The first season had its problems, namely it had a hard time keeping tension and intrigue like the book did, but it succeeded greatly for the most part. So now season 2, and I am happy to say I was not disappointed. Season 2 took some initiative and decided to stray away from the books a bit. This worked for it splendidly at some parts and hurt it at others. The story of Tyrion, Cersei, Joffrey, and Sansa all benefited from the changes. It stayed loyal to the books overall, but the small changes really made them stand out. Theon Greyjoy was also a great character this season and season 2 really made his story work out. Characters like Jon Snow and Arya Stark, however, were more of a mixed package. The problem with Jon Snow is not the writing, it was the performances. Kit Harrington is a terrible Jon and really has a lifeless performance the entire way through. I was constantly bored by his travels through the North and was all the more disappointed that they cut some of the amazing chase scenes in the end of the book for some forced Ygritte/Jon shipping. Arya's story in season 2 was exciting, and I was never bored for a moment during her time on screen, however, much of the character development she had during book 2 was not present here. Clash of Kings was all about Arya losing her identity, and season 2 did not show that in any way. Also there were a few cheesy chase scenes that were unneeded. The biggest disappointed for season 2 was Daenerys. Her entire plot was rushed and convoluted. I knew that they would have to stray from the books with her (she has like 4 POVs)but her entire plot was laughable. We got no developments for the politics of Quarth and I didn't know why I should care with what was happening on screen. Worst of all, Dany turned into a one dimensional little bitch. Despite these grievances, season 2 worked out. I was happy how they portrayed their new characters (Stannis, Davos, and Melisandre) and Margaery Tyrell was a gem on screen. Overall I would give this season a 4/5. Here is hoping they succeed with season 3.",1361059200,5,2272,4.411904761904762

4923842,5,B0060MYM3S,"Once again, HBO proves they are the leader in original programming with the second season of their critically acclaimed Game of Thrones series. Not only is this currently one of the most exciting and well-acted shows on TV, it's one of the best shows in recent memory. It can be a tricky task to translate a book to the small or big screen, but the creators behind GoT have really nailed it; the locations, the costumes, the imagery, the culture...it's all there. Much like Peter Jackson did with the LoTR trilogy, the show runners have picked all the right locations for filming and have made the viewing experience as authentic as possible.

Above all, and what makes the show so great, is the performances given by the actors. Each role was cast wonderfully and there aren't any changes, in my opinion, that would make the show better or more watchable. I could try to name a few standouts but honestly the entire cast is undeniably great.

There are several changes the show made compared to the original book, but at no point did I feel like it took away from the overall story. If you haven't read it, I won't spoil anything but there's some awesome storylines in this season, including Jon Snow's, Arya's, and Tyrion's.

I know it seems like I'm being vague with this review. I could try to pick out a few scenes or moments from this season that stood above the rest but from the opening scene in King's Landing to the unforgettable climax beyond the Wall, this season is great in it's entirety. If you enjoyed the first season, you'll continue to love this one. If you haven't yet started watching this incredible show, do yourself a favor and see what all the hype is about.

4923852,5,B0060MYM3S,I love everything about the books and the HBO series. Sadly it lakes Goerge r.r. Martin about five years to put out a book and he leaves you on tenterhooks,1360022400,,155,4.2
4923853,5,B0060MYM3S,"I no longer bother with writing reviews of any kind, however this Series is so beyond special, that I feel compelled to do so, if only to reaffirm the masses and wake the ones who have not yet followed this series.
The novel written by George R.R. Martin is already a timeless and treasured ""Must Read"" series of books (5 so far, with a 6th being written) is a fictional journey that has been loosely compared to the breathtaking adventures of Lord of the Rings and the Hobbit, but be warned this story is not for children. It is absolutely for mature audiences only. The HBO translation and depiction of this story is mostly accurate to the books (so far) and therefore most readers will be very pleased with the video interpretations of the novel, but I for one am very thankful for both.
The violence, nudity and sexual situations are NOT gratuitous and obligatory, but are very heavy at times. Aside from that I consider this series to be the best mature audience adventure ever and the story, characters, and cinematic landscapes will absolutely astonish and amaze the audience into loyal obsession.
If I had any complaint at all it would be that 10 episodes per season are not enough and the waiting between seasons is agonizing. Book 3, for example, will have to be told in 2 Full Seasons which means it will take almost 3 years to watch. I'm therefore assuming this entire story will take over 10 years to complete. I wonder if the audience loyalty is patient enough and especially I wonder if HBO is successful enough to complete it without running into budget issues like so many other series seem to do. It would be devastating to watch 50-70% of the story only to end it abruptly and prematurely leaving the loyal audience hanging (like they did with 'Deadwood', which I'm still upset over, due to HBO being unable to sustain growing actor salary demands and costs)
This concern however, is nowhere near enough for me to rate this anything less that a FULL 5+ Stars and consider it an absolute marvel of novel and theatrical entertainment.
HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!!!!!!",1360022400,,2079,4.698630136986301

I really enjoy rewatching it to pick up those little details I missed, but it's there.  I'll see what I think after finishing the second book.  I cannot WAIT for season 3 !!!

4923855,5,B0060MYM3S,"When I saw the first series I was absolutely hooked.  My reaction from the start was that someone finally got Medievel right - just as the recent Lord of the Rings movies finally got Tolkein right - finally - heavy sigh.  My next step was to get the Kindle version of all five books and was able to finish the second book before the second series appeared on HBO.  While I understand that some creative license must be allowed to move the story along within the allotted time limits, I was a little disappointed that there were some actions given to other characters to perform and that some time-lines were misplaced as well. This world and all its characters is very tightly interwoven, especially with the Stark family flung to the four corners of that world amid war and chaos.  Some sacrifice to minute detail must be tolerated.  This being said though, I'm going to be disappointed and disillusioned if the third and subsequent seasons stray any further from the books than was seen in the second season.  I am almost finished with the fifth book and am anxiously awaiting the sixth, which is advertised to be released sometime in 2013.  George R R Martin has created a wonderful world, rich and accurate in detail with fascinating characters and story lines.

On the show, Bran, Hodor, Osha, and Rickon stay together, at least for the final episode of season two. Do the changes bother me as a viewer of the show? No, I had no issues.

4923892,2,B0060MYM3S,"First off, I haven't read any of the books, so I have no idea if they ""butchered"" A Clash of Kings or not, and frankly I don't care. I'm a huge HBO fan - The Sopranos, Six Feet Under, and Deadwood are some of the best shows of all time, and of course there's The Wire which is in a class of its own. I'm not much of a fantasy guy, though I've always been a fan of The Lord of the Rings films and the first few Wheel of Time books. I wasn't sure what to expect with Game of Thrones, but dived in with an open mind.

The first season was absolutely enthralling. A detailed and morally complex world with vast scope, intriguing characters and politics that (ironically) feel more realistic than your typical premium cable period-piece, despite doubling as an epic fantasy. The cast is more-or-less first-rate, as is the direction, cinematography and music. The first season invoked a child-like sense of wonder while simultaneously providing a rich, adult-themed story to chew on - the best of both worlds. Every plot-point, from The Wall to Winterfell to King's Landing to the eastern lands - all of them displayed an incredible amount of possibility and potential.

Season Two, on the other hand, is poorly paced and sloppily written, and feels more like a soap opera at times due to the simplified camerawork and excessive two-on-two character scenes (reminds me of the Star Wars prequels where 90% of the dialogue takes place between two characters in a room, usually both sitting down. Very, very lame). The characters and storylines that once held me on the edge of my seat now begin to bore me, as we're subjected to some slow build-up to a big clash of conflicting leaders that results..in..something? This Game isn't half as interesting as the first one.

Not much changes by the time we're finished with the season...Joffrey still has the throne. Stannis still wants the throne. No one knows what Varys wants. Littlefinger hasn't developed at all. We still don't know what happened to Benjen, and the story beyond the wall moves at a snail-pace. Theon is still a moron. Robb is still planning his big war. Sansa is still stuck in King's Landing, and the Kingslayer, while released, is still in Stark (er...Catelyn)-influenced capture by Brienne. Hmm. I'm all for a slow build, but throw us a freakin bone at some point! Some of these storylines just simply don't merit the amount of time they take to unfold, and the lack of resolution rubs me the wrong way (The first season managed to provide some epic payoffs alongside the juicy cliffhangers). The shifts in narrative, which were handled deftly in Season 1, feel awkward this time. Even the music has taken a step down toward cliche melodies and melodrama (whatever happened to the cool, chilling stuff like the White Walker theme?).

There were scenes I can tell were *supposed* to be epic (the brutal murder of a character at Winterfell, for example) but just lacked any real emotional impact. There was always something missing, events just sort of happened without moving me at all.

The dialogue is also very hit-or-miss, and when it misses, it's some cliche, cringe-worthy stuff. The only episode with great dialogue is Episode 9, Blackwater, written by George RR Martin himself. Maybe he should have written all the episodes?

There were a few moments I enjoyed (particularly the Blackwater episode and the finale, which were quite good) but for the most part, this was a massive disappointment, and I have no idea why it's getting such glowing reviews. I'll be back for Season 3 though! :)",1357344000,34,3558,4.767857142857143

4923906,5,B0060MYM3S,"Perhaps the best thing about this series is how you can never know just what's coming next. After the shocking end to the first season (about which I won't go into detail, for those who have yet to see it), it's hard to imagine how the series could top it. But the plot twists and turns, as we learn this season, are only just beginning.

The season premiere opens on a scene of brutal strength and violence (though followers of the books know that it's mere child's play in George R.R. Martin's Westeros). The cruel, sadistic nature of Prince Joffrey is particularly expounded upon throughout the season. Ofttimes, the villainous character in a show will garner support and sympathy from a select number of viewers, but thanks to the writing and superb acting by Jack Gleeson, the entire audience is just dying to get their chance to slap the evil prince.

On that note, it has to be said that this show would not be what it is without its incredible cast. A particularly special find is the sheer amount of talent in its child actors. Sophie Turner, for example, plays Sansa with grace and sensitivity, effortlessly bringing the character from the naive, sometimes bratty, girl she was in season one to a matured, tragic woman in season 2. In addition, Maisie Williams hits the nail on the head with her portrayal of Arya. While in the previous season, Arya could simply be written off as the token tomboy character, she gains new, sometimes disturbing, depth when she and her two new companions, Gendry (Joe Dempsie) and Hot Pie (Ben Hawkey), are captured. From endearing banter to murderous glares, Williams has it all.

While die-hard book fans may be disappointed with some of the changes from page to screen, the series still manages to impress. Admittedly, the dialog is a bit touch-and-go at times. At some points it seems to lag, while at others it's as melodramatic as a soap opera (e.g., ""Where are my dragons?!""). However, overall, these things are only a minor annoyance- and mainly just to fans of the book series.

Whether you've read the books or not, however, the show is a sheer pleasure to watch. The budget seems almost limitless as the locations are more remote and more stunning, the costumes are more real and immersive, and the special effects are, quite simply, art. It's impossible to simply watch this series; with every episode, you become more and more invested in the characters and their stories.

For those who have yet to see this season and are waiting until the discs come out, be prepared to set aside a good 10-hour block of your time. Because once you start, you won't be able to tear yourself away.",1355356800,,2638,4.701298701298701

4923921,5,B0060MYM3S,"My review of the previous season of GAME OF THRONES was that it was really good, but did have some glaring problems, such as how the characters of the Lannisters, particularly Jaime, who just seemed to be, for the most part, intensely unlikable villains with no real reason to exist other than to hate.

I was very glad to see that problem was cleared up in the second season, which is superior to the first in just about every way.

I might get into some spoiler-ish territory here, so tread lightly.

Now, I am coming at this from the perspective of someone who hasn't read the books, so I'm not going to get too heavily into specifics of what I think didn't work, because there still were some problems. The most glaring issue to me was that of the relationship between Robb and Talisa, but there's so much going on here that I'm willing to overlook the speed in which their relationship grows from slightly adversarial to nuptual. I'm assuming that certain plot points needed to be handled with a degree of expediancy to catch up with the rest of the story, which is unfolding slower in some areas but with greater effect.

The change of allegiance of Theon Greyjoy also seems a tad forced from a dramatic point of view, but again, this could very much be a product of the world these characters live in, rather than a more modern world.

The adventure of Jon Snow beyond the Wall is really riveting, and I'm very much looking forward to the appearance of Mance Rayder.

The various troubles of of Arya and Sansa are also very compelling, and I am absolutely in love with Charles Dance as Tywin Lannister.

Of course, while the cast does really compelling work, it's ultimately raised to that AMAZEBALLS level by Peter Dinklage, fully embracing his top billing on the program and episode after episode crushing the role of Tyrion Lannister. While his work continues to stun, also much credit needs to go to Alan Taylor, director of many of the episodes of this show. While he's now just breaking into feature films with the next THOR feature, we have a veteran of feature film coming and lending his expertise to what is by far the best episode of this season.

That director is Neil Marshall (DOG SOLDIERS, THE DESCENT, DOOMSDAY, CENTURION) and that episode is ""Blackwater"" as the forces of Stannis Baratheon begin their siege of King's Landing. It hits every beat it needs to, from the actual assault to Tyrion's St. Crispin's Day speech to the breathless last moments of the episode with Cersei, and it does it with such cinematic assurance that it's an award-worthy piece of directing.

Also a big step up for the show is making Cersei and Jaime a little more three-dimensional (even though Jaime is still a tad less crisply characterized), and that's due in large part to Lena Headey and Nikolaj Coster-Waldau. Also still bringing majesty to her role is Emilia Clarke as Daenerys Targaryen, and Iain Glen as her most-trusted aide Ser Jorah is excellent as well.

4923924,4,B0060MYM3S,"Winter is coming. War is here. Season 2 of the epic GAME OF THRONES rolls out ten episodes, expands on its cast roster, meets and then surpasses expectations. Somewhere lurking nearby, George R.R. Martin is cackling maniacally as his brain child keeps on getting lauded. I encourage those with a yen for full-on gratification to NOT read the books until the television show has adapted them. Sucks for me that I read the novels years ago and so what happens next is still seared on memory.

Seven kingdoms at war, is where we're at. Sundry contentious nobles, nursing dreams of conquest, all playing the game of thrones, with Robb Stark shockingly emerging as a charismatic warlord. We track seven or eight anchor characters, and the wonder of the show is that it retains clarity and manages to keep us absorbed - to one extent or another - with each plot trajectory. I think one of the most eagerly anticipated characters is the sinister fire priestess, Melisandre, or as I like to call her, Miss ""The night is dark and full of terrors."" Carice van Houten portrays her with dangerous and enigmatic charm, and, even in a show packed with accomplished femme fatales, she stands out. And yet she's only one of several new and intriguing female characters introduced in Season 2. My favorite is probably the spunky Ygritte (played by a lively Rose Leslie). She gives Jon Snow's arc a much needed boost. Jon Snow and the Night's Watch, beyond the Wall, sort of needed to get a move on with their narrative. Even Joss Whedon is impressed with George R.R. Martin's strong portrayal of his women characters. Whedon may even be appalled by the frequency with which Martin kills off his characters. Or maybe not.

So a sprawling cast sprawls on, too many to mention, really. It's a busy show. Inasmuch as someone in an ensemble cast can dominate attention, Peter Dinklage, fresh off his Emmy win, is that culprit. He takes over from Sean Bean as the series' predominant focus. I think we were all looking forward to Tyrion Lannister's arrival at King's Landing as the newly appointed Hand of the King. We realize that the imp is galaxies more devious than the foolishly direct and honorable Ned Stark. And, yes, Tyrion doesn't waste time carving out his sizable niche, bedeviling his adversaries by dint of clever retorts and wily strategies and a healthy bump of self-preservation and pragmatism. In a pit of vipers, Tyrion finds himself at home and very much enjoying the game. I say, pencil Dinklage in for another Emmy. One of my very favorite interactions are those between Tyrion and his fabulously sarcastic bodyguard Bronn (Jerome Flynn). Not lagging too far behind are those marvelous exchanges between Jon Snow and Ygritte and between the disguised Arya and Lord Tywin.

There's only so much room, only an hour per episode, only ten episodes a season. To service new characters and new story arcs, several of the established characters get short shrift. I feel that Daenerys's arc suffers the most. The Khaleesi still wanders the desert, her lips all chapped, her tribespeople slowly dying around her. When she arrives at a fabulous desert metropolis, she finds herself quickly at odds with the unimpressed city council as she tries to gain support for her cause. I'm frankly disappointed in her lack of character progression. I'd venture to say that she even regresses some in Season 2.

Cersei recedes into the background for most of Season 2 but makes a roaring comeback in the ""Blackwater"" episode. Lena Headey is always sensational when given camera time, exuding brittleness and venom and a sort of twisted maternal tenderness. We get the sense that Cersie has realized to her horror that she'd allowed things to slip away from her control. There's an unforgettable moment between her and her despised brother, Tyrion, - dang, I forget which episode but you'll know the scene - which pretty much encapsulates their relationship. In that moment, a desolate Cersei was in dire need of comfort and you could feel Tyrion wanting to reach out, but...

GAME OF THRONES is currently the best show on television, good on HBO for going all in with George R.R. Martin's vision and sparing no expenses. Everything about the series is top notch, everything. The sharp writing, the exceptional cast, the production values, on and on and on. Even the sex and nudity are classily handled and work to propel the narrative. In Season 2, the magical elements ramp up. We glimpse a witch at work and her smoke monster, a faceless man, and revenants. In the backdrop hurtles a meteor, signifying mystical portent. And, as always, there be dragons. In a season comprised of magnificent episodes, the highlight of highlights is the effing brilliant ""Blackwater."" This is the episode to which the showrunners dedicated most of the season's budget. ""Blackwater"" features not only some indelible character moments but also the most number of wicked awesome kill scenes.

And maybe now we can ease off a bit on Sansa. Turns out, she's not too shabby at playing the game.

And that depraved boy king Joffrey... how much do you want to wring his neck? Even Carter Burke from ALIENS says Joffrey is a tool. Dolores Umbridge agrees.",1345334400,10,5209,4.865839909808343

4923926,4,B0060MYM3S,"Since the home video release has yet to come out I'll mostly be commenting on the merits of the show itself as opposed to the forthcoming additional features.

While the show's writers did an excellent job of adapting the first novel (A Game of Thrones) into a ten episode season this time around the challenges were far greater than even they may have expected. Based upon the second book ""A Clash of Kings"", season two had the intimidating job of trying to cover a continent-wide war for the Iron Throne along with the continuation of Daenerys Targaryen's story arc within the same amount of time as the first run. Suffice it to say if you thought the scope of season one was significant this time around it's even greater.

Unfortunately for hardcore purists who expect a nearly identical translation of the novel it doesn't happen as many liberties are taken with this season in order to make everything fit properly. The general tale is still intact but you'll find that quite a lot of content from the book doesn't make it into the season or in certain instances is augmented and tailored to get the general idea across but isn't as fleshed out. Season 2 also sports quite a bit of created scenes in order to support the inclusion of the character Robb (who is no longer a viewpoint character in the novel) as well as to support an entirely new series of events for Daenerys whose original story-arc is mostly left on the cutting room floor.

Despite all of these changes and fixes getting under some fans' skin, comfort can be taken in the fact that season 2 continues onwards with brilliant performances from the cast, both old and new, as well as some awe-inspiring set pieces and locations (Northern Ireland, Croatia, and Iceland). With Sean Bean and Mark Addy gone there was some concern on both the audiences' and writers' parts about how well the rest of the actors and actresses would hold up. Thankfully quite a number of them stepped up to fill that void: Theon (Alfie Allen) finally gets some screen time as we see him struggle between his ties to Robb and his disapproving and cold family, Arya (Maisie Williams) has to use her wits and her lessons from her father and Syrio Forel in order to survive amongst enemies, and Tyrion (Peter Dinklage) in an unexpected way replaces Eddard Stark (Sean Bean) as being Joffrey/Cersei's main combatant as he seeks to bring the young ruler and his mother to heel.

The second season brings other changes as well. For instance the overwhelming amount of nudity and sex from the first has been vastly curtailed. I think I can count the number of times sex happens on screen on only one hand and honestly that's perfectly alright to me. In a lot of ways the sex felt absolutely useless in the first season (most of which was purely created for the show) aside from possibly the attempt of the writers or HBO to attract viewers through such things. Now that a large audience is secured and critical praise is running rampant it appears as though the program doesn't need to feature it as prominently. Replacing the sex however is blood and guts. This season is a lot more violent than the last which isn't only a reflection of Martin's work but also indicative of the additional funding which the show received as a result of its highly positive reception. Fans will be ecstatic to see that Stannis Baratheon's attack on King's Landing actually makes it into the season (having an entire episode dedicated to it) in all its fiery, blood soaked glory.

Overall the second season is right on par with what the first established in terms of quality. The acting is still great, the locations are beautiful, and the story-telling is gripping. Once again though - those that wanted a direct copy of A Clash of Kings will not be entirely happy. However those people can take solace in the fact that the heart of the novel is still very much intact and effectively adapted to the screen.

If there is one flaw to season two though it has to be the number of viewpoints. Season one told its story using the nine different perspectives from the first novel - a feat made a little easier for the show in that many of them were actually together in the same place (though thinking and doing different things). Season two on the other hand pulls from nine characters once again but also stays with Robb who is only referenced to by others or appears in dialogues with Catelyn in the book. On top of this most of the characters are on their own as opposed to a couple being in one place and others being somewhere else. The result of this is a lot of transitions within a single episode. Although the shifts are still fluid and not confusing at all it makes for potentially disappointing episodes if your favorite character or story-arc only gets shown for about seven minutes out of an hour. This is also undoubtedly the reason why so much from the source material either gets severely cut-down or left out entirely.",1345075200,16,4956,4.6261363636363635
4923927,3,B0060MYM3S,"Daniella Obraztsov IMO has done an excellent review on this series, and that being the case, I can't see the point in repeating what she has commented on here. I basically agree with her review, and to anyone reading this, please read the books first, then watch the DVD/recorded series. You will not get an accurate portrayal of the stories otherwise. The producers strayed so far the books, it was in a word, pathetic. The Undying scene for instance, wasn't anything like the book. There was so much more to Jon's story left out. The battle scene towards the end in the book, was nothing like the DVD. Tyrion was in the heat of the battle on one of the sinking ships, when saved by his squire, not out side the castle walls. There was no mention or sight of his famous chain in the river. There was so many important parts of the story left out, that to me, the series made little sense. The producers should have taken the time to write the adaptation more acturately and include a few more episodes if necessary, to get it right. Yes I realise they have a budget, but it's the old story, do it right, or don't do it at all. Fantastic books, and I take my hat off to Martin, how he kept track of all those story lines is beyond me.

4923928,5,B0060MYM3S,"I must say that I agree that Season 2 greatly deviates from the book ""A Clash of Kings"".  However, each can be appreciated in their own right.  I was greatly disappointed in how Arya is portrayed in the series.  She shows more initiative and guile in the book; I found her a little annoying in the series.  One of my favorite characters is Tyrion, played to perfection by Peter Dinklage and the other Jon Snow.  His (Snow) characteristics, I like are that he is strong and silent (meaning that he pay attention to what is happening and reserves judgement) with a sense of right and wrong.  I actually enjoyed the series so much that at the end of season 2 I had to buy all the books available in Jamaica on the  ""A Song of Ice and Fire"", as I could not wait to find out what happens in season 3. Though with all the changes, I am glad that I started with book 1 and not book 3 as I would probably be perplexed.  I am half way into book 2 and the book version is better in most ways than the series, however the battle for King's Landing in the series was excellent.  I prefer Shae's character in the series to the book.  All the actors were excellent.  Really a stellar cast.  HBO, keep up the good work.

- Meera and Jojen Reed and Edmure and Brynden Tully are held back for another season.  In books, Edmure Tully is in part responsible for Tywin Lannister being close enough to King's Landing to rush back with the Tyrells when Stannis besieges the capital.

However, if the show wasn't so good, no one would bother.  Game of Thrones is the best series on TV, in spite of a few flaws.  HBO should hire the crew who put together that parody, because of their exceptional work, and keen perception of the material!

Season 2 was fantastic, the highlight being Episode 9, written by George R.R. Martin himself.  It was like a top-notch feature film.

The TV version of Game of Thrones is an interpretation of the original books.  David Benioff and D.B. White use their own expertise to bring the books to the screen.  It's not child's play. They are thoroughly familiar with the source material and bring it to life in an entertaining way.  Their work is groundbreaking.

My only complaint was in Episode 10.  While I've been able accept CG direwolves and dragons, I was disappointed with the CG White Walker on a horse.  A cartoon isn't scary enough.  Hopefully, the production team can come up with a better idea...

4923934,5,B0060MYM3S,"Dear fellow Game of Thrones viewers, potential and current alike,

As an avid A Song of Ice and Fire fan, I cannot resist the urge to say that any reader should experience the epic and tragic tale of Westeros. Nevertheless, this review is about the current HBO spin-off of the rave political fantasy brawl.

I will not spill the bloody details or shocking twists and turns of the show, nor will I layout a treasure map of the plotline for Game of Thrones. That is not the point of a review, the reason is to advice potential buyers and viewers whether or not the item is Aye, or Nay.

With that, the Second Season of Game of Thrones is simply put, amazing. Do not expect your typical Lord of the Rings fantasy adventure; expect bloody plots, devastating climaxes, and gripping horror. Game of Thrones is not for the light of heart, that loose their grip on the present to a splash of blood, or a glimpse of a nipple; or the young of age, whom should not even be in the same room when this show is airing. (Shame on you if so)

However, do not strife. This is not one of those shows that is merely sex and blood. No, be prepared to be floored by the twists and turns of the devious plotline. You will be enthralled, gripped, and captivated by the talent on and off screen.

To put it simply, Game of Thrones (both season one, two, and beyond, based on the novels) is astounding. You might get a little confused by the cast of thousands and dismayed by some of the events, but Game of Thrones is entertainment at its best.

I would now like to address the unhappy viewers that are distressed about the show detouring from the novel. Let me share some words of wisdom from a quote written by George R.R. Martin, himself, from his A Game of Thrones The Graphic Novel: Volume One,

""The comic book is not the book; the graphic novel is not the novel. The same, of course, is true of the films and television. When we move a story from one medium to another, no matter how faithful we attempt to be, some changes are inevitable. Each medium has its own demands, its own restrictions, its own way of telling a story.

There are aspects of my epic fantasy series, A Song of Ice and Fire, that make it an especially difficult work to translate to any visual medium. The sheer scale of it. All those scenes. All those settings. A cast of thousands. The complexity of my plots and subplots. The structure: tight third-person narratives, interwoven from the viewpoint of many different characters. In the novels, I make free use of some techniques that work well in prose, and less well, or not at all, for a visual medium: internal monologues, flashbacks, unreliable narrators. I strive to put you inside the heads of my characters, make you privy to their thoughts, let you see the world through their eyes. Screenwriters and comic-book scriptors cannot do any of that, not without resorting to clumsy devices like voice-overs and thought balloons. For all these reasons, I went for years thinking A Game of Thrones and its sequels would never be adapted. Not for film, not television, and certainly not for funny books. Just. Could. Not. Be. Done.

Shows you what I know.
...

For my part, I love television series, and I love the comics...er, graphic novel...too. This is my world, these are my people, and this is still my story, now being told in a different medium, where a whole new audience can enjoy it.
...

A series of novels.  A television show. A comic book. Three different media, each with its own strengths and weaknesses, its own pleasure and frustrations...but all ultimately telling the same story.""

There you have it folks. I understand it can be slightly frustrating when a TV show, movie, etc. does not follow the book verbatim, however, it is its own story. Reading Martin's Preface to his Graphic Novel allowed me to understand and relinquish any hostilities toward TV shows or movies that did not honor the ""complete"" storyline of personal favorites. Take the previous words to heart, and you will realize just how marvelous Game of Thrones Season Two is, by itself, as its own story.",1341878400,46,4099,4.568119891008174

4923938,5,B0060MYM3S,"We've got kings climbing out of the woodwork vying for the coveted Iron Throne.  We've got a little girl wandering around the countryside just trying to get home, and what she does just to survive, and another young lady just trying to stay alive, living among her enemies.  We've got one little boy left in charge of the homestead and trying to keep the home fires burning.  We've got a young man trying to find his place upon the Wall and beyond it, and another who could possibly jeopardize his war for independence due to his hormones.  Add into the mix, two brothers who can't seem to come to terms, a trusted friend turned traitor, a stalwart amazonian female knight charged with the daunting task of protecting a prized prisoner, a red witch, dragons, emerging magic, a cameo appearance of a familiar face from season one, and an awesome season end shot of what creeps and crawls beyond the Wall.  This is a recipe you can't wait to sample when it's done cooking!

The cast is amazing, but then, was there any doubt?  Who does not love the irrepressible Tyrion, (Peter Dinklage)?  He's accused of many things he hasn't done, but doesn't get the credit for the good things he has done, yet he always seems to take it in stride.  Close on his heels is Jamie, (wonderfully played by Nikolaj Coster-Waldau).  Next to Tyrion, he's got some of the best one liners, ""Where did you find that massive beast?"" (referring to Brianne (loved that!).  Bronn (Jerome Flynn), is great as Tyrion's muscle.

We get a couple of brief glimpses into Cersei's (Lena Heady) attempt at humanity when she laments to Tyrion about what her and Jamie's actions may have brought about.  But it's not enough to allow us to sympathize with her a whole lot, as she's still a hateful manipulative person.  Tywin (superbly executed by Charles Dance) is cold and unyielding, but delightful to watch.

Arya (Maise Williams) is magnificent as she's thrust into an unknown world and tries to adapt as best she can.  Sansa, (Sofie Turner) although still naive in a lot of respects, is starting to use her wits somewhat, and knows the right things to say and do to keep from getting beat by her ""beloved Joffrey's"" henchmen, or worse.  She's learning the game. Littlefinger, (Aiden Gillen) and Varys, (Conleth Hill) are, as always, the snake and the spider. Both are wonderful in their roles.

Bran, (Issac Hemstead Wright) tries to run Winterfell as best he can in the absence of his brother and mother.  At least he has Maester Luwin for council, as well as wildling Osha, and let's not forget his surrogate legs, Hodor.

Jon's (Kit Herrington) oath and loyalty will be tested as the Night's Watch ventures beyond the Wall to gather information.  The constant badgering and harassing of Jon by wildling Ygritte is delightful to watch.  She definitely gets under his skin.  Robb does his best to continue to win battles and loses his heart, while Catelyn (Michelle Fairley) will do whatever it takes to bring her girls home.  Speaking of loyalty, Dany (Emilia Clarke) finds out who her friends are and who aren't.  We see a different side to the Theon (Alfie Allen) we've known, and see a much more sadistic side to Joffrey (Jack Gleeson), (me thinks the apple doesn't fall too far from this family tree).

I am a ASoIaF book reader, (on book 4, a Feast for Crows).  After watching spellbound to season 1, I decided to pick of the books.  I'm glad I did.  Having watched the show before having read the books allowed me to put faces to names, got a sense of places and of course the magnitude of the ever imposing Wall.  It greatly helped in understanding this immense world known as Westeros.  Let me tell you, it can get confusing, it's that big!

And, because it's so big, HBO had to streamline some events and/or characters.  Keep in mind, this is an adaptation.  If the show followed the books word for word, that would be boring, because we'd know everything that was going to happen.  At that point, why watch at all?  There is no element of suprise, such as there is now with these (what I feel is minor) changes.  This way, it keeps book readers on their toes.

Some events which were not in the books are in the show.  Does that devalue the story of the books?  In my opinion, no... not really.  While interaction between Arya and Tywin never took place in the book, I loved the fact their paths crossed in the show, and personally that's an event which would have played out well in the book.  The scene of the council of 13 in Qarth with Pyat Pree was fabulous, and I could have easily seen it as part of the book.  True, there was no ""weasel soup"" but with an undertaking of this massive size, some events just have to go, some characters have to do double duty to knit the storyline together.  Yes, they've deviated from the sacred books, but I do understand the necessity of it.

A couple of places in the show were muddied just a little bit.  They should have gone more in depth and been more succinct over the importance of Arya's ""list"", as well as clarifying what was happening between Qhorin Halfhand and Jon.  It can be a bit confusing to non-book readers. While I thought they could have done the House of the Undying a bit better, it was nice to see a familiar face.  Other than that, I've got no complaints about the season.  The story and our characters progressed, some a little more than others.  Even with the changes and deviations, this is by far, the best show out there.  It bites that we have to wait almost a year before season 3.

Definitely a keeper.  It is known....  : )

4923939,4,B0060MYM3S,"After watching the epic-ness that was the first season, and previously reviewing it on Amazon, Season 2 earned 4 fours. Why? Mainly because they deviated from the book. As a long time book fan, it was quite surprising to see the writers of Game of Thrones remove themselves a little bit from the plot of the book; it was, at times, annoying, yet not all that unpleasant. The fact that George R. R. Martin continues to be consulted on his magnum-opus-turned-hit-TV show is a redeeming factor. I mean, who else would you ask for approval? Martin also wrote the last two episodes, which were arguably the best two episodes of the season.

As with the first Season, the visuals were absolutely, positively stunning. Filming sets in Croatia and Ireland were extremely well done, and though I was never quite as enamored with TV Quarth's lack of book-inspired opulence, the shots of the surrounding landscape were magnificent. The HBO team certainly kept up with the great work they did on filming locations. I was also impressed in regards to the costumes and props incorporated into the show. The grit, dirt, and grime added an element of authenticity to the medieval feel of the books.

My biggest gripe with the second season was the lack of characters that were introduced in the book but not the show. *SPOILERS* Where were Jojen and Meera, the crannogmen of Greywater Watch? Did the writers make a mistake by choosing to include them later? Wtf is going on with the girl from Volantis (Jeyne Westerling in disguise?) *SPOILERS*

There are a plethora of things to love about Season 2, though, despite my petty complaints.

Peter Dinklage can do no wrong - Because Peter Dinklage. He has made the role of Tyrion his own. If by some unfortunate, hypothetical incident Peter Dinklage is unable to act as Tyrion, no one, and I mean NO ONE, will be able to step into those shoes.

Cersei, oh Cersei - I love how much I hate Cersei. Her vulnerability is expanded upon in this Season, and its actually beginning to grow on me. One of those liberties taken from the book that turned out pleasantly surprising. Best line of this season in response to Sansa's ""But you were Robert's queen!"" --> ""And you will be Joffrey's, enjoy."" *drinks herself blind*

Theon - For some odd reason, I can't latch on to Theon's humanization in this season as much as Cersei's. The writers tried to show a vaguely sympathetic side to Theon's story, but I wasn't as captured by Alfie Allen's performance. There's plenty of time to change that, though.

Brienne the Badass - My flawless queen. That is all.

Daenerys - I wasn't as interested in Daenarys this season because she had such limited screen time and because her character seemed kind of just... there. There were bouts of fierceness that really suck you in (for example, the Quartheen entreaty), but there were also scenes that seemed boring. To be fair, much of the action was focused on King's Landing in Westeros, and much more time was devoted to those scenes.

Joffrey - Where is my fabulous Joffrey slap? Every episode requires a fabulous backhand across this little punk's baby-bottom smooth cheek. Very much looking forward to his death in Season 3. Hoping Bronn will say something snarky about him dying a virgin.

Tywin and Arya - Personally, for me, the quadrumvirate of Arya, Tywin, Brienne, and Tyrion MADE this season. Hands down. There was such a fantastic chemistry between Maisie Williams and Charles Dance, and for the writers and directors to make use of that said something about the amazing quality of this show. My favorite scenes of the season, no question, were the interactions between Arya and Tywin. It reminded me a lot of that visceral scene in season 1 between Tywin and Jaime when he was gutting the deer (?). This is Emmy-winning material.

Stannis and Melisandre - Just... ew.

Jon Snow - One of the fan favorites of the show and book, Kit Harington has yet to live up to the vision of Jon Snow that the book has fleshed out. Make no mistake, I'm sure he will get there, but right now, rugged, dark-bearded Kit Harington is too naive a Jon Snow. There aren't enough scenes to show his growth (maybe in Season 3). He may know nothing, but at least his taste in women is immaculate. Ygritte is hot.

Special mention: Roz - Because Roz has come so far. Roz was barely mentioned in the book, but if George Martin included her in the TV show, she's got to have a role in something. She's really, really enticing, and her role is one of those minor changes that actually surprised me in a good way.

Season 1 set the standard. Season 2 didn't quite live up to that standard, but it was still pretty damn good. And it kept me at the edge of my seats with anticipation. This fan is certainly won over.",1339718400,6,4758,4.648809523809524

I will not read the books as there are too many spoilers [really??] and I so do NOT want to have any preconceived ideas or expectations other than a continuation of the superb directing, acting, costuming, scenery, and in general, everything. As another fan wrote above me, even the child acting is simply top drawer. The wolves even seem in tune with the directors wishes! Are there issues: of course, as some who have read the entire series pointed out the ""license"" related to relative ages of the characters and story lines [the marriage of a 13 year old common in our real not so distant past will not occur in this presentation. No loss there in fact, at all] and there are others I am sure when I do break down and eventualy buy/read the series I will recognize. But for the vast majority of people, HBO has hit a Home Run and pitched a No-Hitter. I fully agree with the senitment, and can recommend this series TO ADULTS without hesitation. There IS nudity and other adult behaviors/language, as the stories are mostly about the machinations and conniving of ""Those Who Would Be King"" and those who for whatever reason, help put him there. So, not for the immature. A great series so far and well worth the now-twenty hours of seasons 1 & 2 to watch. Enjoy.

4923941,4,B0060MYM3S,"I LOVE this show.  Yes, I'm a hugeee book fan and don't appreciate all of the changes in the show, but overall I am a huge fan.

Rating guide:
Non-readers: 4-5 stars
General book readers: 3.5-4.5 stars
Book purists/fanatical: 0-2 stars

This is a great show, but in my eyes it's just not as good as season 1.  It is definitely better compared to most of what is on television and the acting is superb and extremely well cast.  However, my problems with this season revolve around two main issues:

#1) the severe deviations from the books that the D.B. Weiss and David Benioff have taken.  In the first season deviations existed, but mostly to the point to help with time/budget constraints.  The writers still generally stayed true to the characters.

Season 2 is a whole different story.  GRRM has spoken many times of the Butterfly Effect.  The more the writers change things, the more the story is going to change in the long run.  With the huge amount of characters in the series, seemingly little changes can have huge implications.  While season 1 generally stayed true to the novel (which I gave five stars to), season 2 took a life of its own.  Many story lines were completely invented or so heavily modified that they barely were anything like the books.

I know that television/movies adaptations MUST be different from the books.  However, I think it's crucial that the writers still accurately capture the essence of the characters.  When the writers started to play with the characters and get cute, I decided that they weren't doing it due to budget/time constraints, but because they thought they were *better.*  And they're not.

#2) It isn't as nearly as good overall this season compared to last, REGARDLESS book deviations.  Storylines drag, some dialogue is so bad that it seems like it was taken out of a cheesy soap opera (cliches abound), there are really disjointed and awkward scenes, and they can't seem to do much else except have two people in a room talking to each other.  The pacing to me was just off this season.

More in-depth look at my problems with season 2:

*Important scenes and character arcs are modified beyond recognition.  While some changes must be made for the sake of adaptation, that's not true for everything.  There was no reason to completely change The House of the Undying scene, which was one of the most interesting scenes in the entire series to something that was so irrelevant and had nothing to do with a ""song of ice and fire.""  it wouldn't have hurt to use a little more caution with Jon's character as well, because his famous ""kill"" was confusing and its intentions unclear to many viewers.  Arya's storyline was not a bad one in the show, but looked like a Disney version of what was in the books.  I was looking forward to seeing the gritty brutality of it, and instead it just fell flat.  Robb Stark....I don't even want to go there.  It may be his storyline that infuriates me the most out of them all.  In the books he was a fool that I could sympathize with; in the show he's not only a fool, but a jerk (to put it mildly). I won't go into details due to spoilers and you may not understand if you haven't read the books, but his character is butchered beyond redemption.

*Women are dramatically different in the show than the books.  The writers feel the need to make the majority of the female cast ""badass,"" ruthless, and/or bratty.  An example is Tyrion's whore, Shae.  In the books she is very obedient to Tyrion and very much acts like a prostitute (which she is).  She shows signs of cleverness, but most of their interactions are based on sex and lust.  In the show, Shae has a huge potty mouth, acts like a big ""tough girl,"" and doesn't treat Tyrion like someone of high noble birth in the slightest.  The writers think they are making a more complex and dynamic character by making Shae witty and rebellious, because that seems like Tyrion's type of gal.  However, nothing's ever so simple.  One of Tyrion's biggest weaknesses is his naivety in love and even though he *knows* Shae is at the root, just a whore in it for money, he can't stay away from her.  It's a richly layered story that doesn't need assistance from the writers.  They also changed Robb's love interest to someone completely different, and once again she was more of a ""bratty rebel.""  Dany is another character that is also much more cruel in the show.  The writers have no imagination when it comes to writing/modifying the women in the book.  And Sansa, one of the main characters in the books, is hugely neglected for most of the season.  I guess she just isn't ""cool enough.""

Not to mention, Dany's entire storyline in Qarth was different.  Hardly any of it was from the books.  I understood and expected that, considering she was rather inactive for most of book two and her chapters were admittedly pretty boring, but instead of changing it for the better, they somehow managed to turn it into a ridiculous soap opera that made little to no sense.

*Cheesiness.  One of the things I love about GRRM is that he is never a cheesy romance writer.  I DO enjoy scenes that show true emotion and express things I can empathize with, such as love for others.  I DON'T enjoy super contrived, cheesy romance stories that are so cliche and boring that not even my most ""hopeless romantic"" friends can enjoy it.  And there was just too much of that in this show, especially between Robb and a certain love interest.  The dialogue was just atrocious.  But David Benioff DID write Troy, so that explains quite a bit.

*Two characters talking to each other in a room.  It seems like practically every scene is two people in a room talking to each other.  The writers don't seem to excel particularly well at writing group scenes, and like the one-on-one talks.  This is alright to an extent, but I think sometimes it makes it come off as a cheesy medieval soap opera.  Not good.

An example of this is Arya Stark and Tywin Lannister in Harrenhal.  Charles Dance and Maisie Williams have amazing on-screen chemistry together and are a joy to watch, but they had their little back-and-forth banter for what....4 episodes?  It got a little old.  Arya is supposed to be going through a living HELL while at Harrenhal, not hanging out with Daddy Warbucks all the time.

*All of the little mistakes.  A few mistakes is normal and expected - a ton is not and a sign of lazy writing.  These writers claim to making a somewhat faithful adaptation of ASOIAF, yet they continue to mess up religions, locations, and simple Westerosi facts the entire show.  And these weren't things that had anything to do with budget constraints.  Having northern men referencing to praying to the Seven for instance, is completely unfaithful to the books, and the only reason I can come up with them changing it is simple - lazy writing.  The Old Gods were already mentioned several times in season 1, so there is no reason to have men of the North praying to gods of the South.  A bunch of little things like that add up over time and seem like a disservice to book readers.  Most of us highly appreciate the little things in the books being acknowledged and done correctly.  Not to mention, these errors could be seen by even a non-reader, considering religions have already been established and explored to a degree in the first season.

If you are a book reader and can completely separate the books from the show in your head, you can still enjoy this.  It's entertaining, suspenseful, and brutal.  It moves at a rather uncomfortably slow pace, but gains some momentum toward the end.  Also, the show is mostly very good at staying true to Theon's arc, which is one of the most interesting in the series.  The Battle at Blackwater Bay Episode (8) was also phenomenal, and written by GRRM himself.  It is possibly the greatest battle scene in television HISTORY.  If only he could be a writer in every episode!

I would also like to add that GRRM does NOT have any sort of veto power or control over the script and final decision making.  He can loosely be called a ""consultant"" and has one episode a season to write, but that's it.  He has said himself that D&D can do whatever they want (turn the characters to zombies or getting abducted by aliens is all within their right - HIS WORDS) and he can't stop it.  The show is D&D's baby, not his.  He doesn't ""approve"" or ""sign off"" on anything.  I know that D&D probably for the most part kind of want to stay true to the books, but they DO NOT HAVE TO.  Proof is in my second comment - and that's in reference to the very faithful first season, not season 2.

Great things about this season?
-Amazing CGI and battle scenes, including the direwolves.  Grey Wind is fierce and Ghost is just beautiful.
-Superb casting.  Peter Dinklage as Tyrion Lannister, Lena Headey as Cersei Lannister, Nikolaj Coster-Waldau as Jaime Lannister, Conleth Hill as Varys, Charles Dance as Tywin Lannister, Alfie Allen as Theon Greyjoy, and the list goes on and on.  We also have the addition of Gwendoline Christie as Brienne of Tarth and many other new characters, and Christie as Brienne is just perfection.  She IS Brienne.
-With a few exceptions, Theon Greyjoy's storyline was an excellent book to television translation. It's a shame how quickly the seasons have to move, because it's one of the most intriguing storylines in the entire series.  Alfie Allen also gave a stellar performance as Theon.
-Brienne/Jaime scenes were classic and they have great on-screen chemistry.
-The behind the scenes look at the Loras/Renly/Margaery triangle was very well done.

And that's just a few.  It's great in MANY ways and is beautifully done on so many levels.
I would also make a list of things that book purists wouldn't like, but that would be about 20 pages (not kidding).

So, do I recommend this?  Definitely not to a severe book purist, but yes in general and definitely to a non-reader.  I personally don't enjoy the major deviations and wish they would stay truer to the novel, but it all depends on the viewer.  I'm not trying to say that this a terrible show, because it's not.  It's beautiful and I'm thrilled to see some of my favorite characters ever come to life.  It's simply just becoming more and more different from the books, and for some people like me, that's not appreciated.  Just remember, this isn't A Song of Ice & Fire this season, but a loose adaptation of it set in an ASOIAF world.  And not to mention, in my opinion this is a downgrade from the first season, book reader or not.

I have faith though that things will become better in the future, however, because A Storm of Swords will be broken up into two seasons.  That will give the writers some more leeway and time to develop things (hopefully).  Also, we have some great new cast members for next season, such as Iwan Rheon (probably as Ramsay Bolton), Ciar&aacute;n Hinds (as Mance Rayder and played Caesar in HBO's Rome), Tobias Menzies (as Edmure Tully and was in HBO's Rome as Brutus [funny, huh?]), Clive Russell as Brynden ""The Blackfish"" Tully, Diana Rigg as Olenna Tyrell, and a host of other new cast members.  Lots to look forward to!",1338940800,547,11185,4.614799797263051
4923942,4,B0060MYM3S,"I was amazed and pleased with series 1, especially how close it followed the book. I base this review on the first 4 episodes of series 2. As others have already pointed out that HBO  took some liberties with the source material and added scenes that were not even mentioned  in the book and changed some characters completely mostly to titillate the audience. It is still a great show, however I wish they would stay true to the original story. I just reread the 2nd book again and it is pretty clear in my memory. (SPOILER AHEAD) - nowhere in the book do you find any mention that Lord Renly is gay. Nowhere in the book is any description that Joffrey (as evil as he may be)tortures 2 naked prostitutes - one apparently to death. Arya's escape with the assistance of the black brother does not come to a sudden halt by being captured (and most of them killed) at their first rest stop, as a matter of fact they beat the Lanister's knights back and NOBODY was killed - what happens later is another story. And there are more of these inconsistencies just in the first 4 airings of series 2. The story also gets a bit ahead of itself and I have to agree that viewers who did not read the books might find it confusing to figure out the new characters, which where not already introduced in series 1, since there is no explanation of relationships, different houses, loyalties to one or the other, etc., which might become clear later, but by then a few uninitiated viewers might very well have given up trying to figure it out.
All in all I enjoy the series so far - just hope they do not get too far away from the original story - which happened with ""True Blood"", which is not recognizable any more in relationship to the books and frankly is getting just awful after a promising start.",1335139200,5,1788,4.398791540785498

8490466,5,B0060MYM3S,"When I first saw ads for Game of Thrones I immediately was super turned off and was sure it was ultra stupid and knew it sucked.  Somehow I wound up watching about 5 minutes of an episode and was instantly hooked.  I've since bought every season.  Every single episode/season is the bomb.  Best TV movie ever made.  Super engaging plots, music, interior and exterior settings, color, characters, suspense, eroticism and everything else are top of the heap.  I've bought entire seasons and watched 2-3 episodes a night.  Can't begin to recommend it highly enough.  I can't believe that  Season 8 isn't going to be aired until next year.  When I heard it was going to be aired this summer I got freaked out wondering how I could wait an entire year without seeing a new season.  Recently learned that it won't come out until next year (2019) and that it will only have 6 episodes.  What an immense bummer.  But I'm sure it will be more than worth it.
