2017129,2,B0001MZ7B4,"Okay, I say this since I own the Japanese originals of this anime, and have seen the episodes dubbed by 4Kids Entertainment.
Firstly, the music in this dub is terrible. Why they ruined the soundtrack with something this 'kiddy' is beyond reason. The original soundtrack was perfect for the series, highlighting drama and action, while this music is always happy and over-used/enthusiastic. There is probably not one scene when this music is not played.
Secondly, though the dubbing process takes time, they refused to allow the original Sonic Team voicecast (e.g. Ryan Drummond) to voice the characters, saying since they did not live in New York they could not. Even when they offered to move to New York to dub, 4kids refused. Though the dub is done quite well, there are obvious faults with the translations. They say Eggmans first base IS Chaos Control, while Chaos Control is actually what causes them to be transported. These are obvious problems which 4Kids probably deemed 'unnoticeable'.
The only reason why I give this 2 stars is because the animation itself is very good, attention to detail is immaculate.
If you want to see this anime to its full potential, I recommend that you import the original Japanese DVDs and find translations for it/learn japanese, as this dub is sure to disappoint versus the original japanese versions.",1078012800,2,1343,5.0

2017152,5,B0001MZ7B4,"I know I'm going to be killed for saying this, but I like the edited versions of this show.  The Japanese version contains some fairly strong swear words and a little more violence.  While I certainly wouldn't mind a little more action, I appreciate the editing out of the swear words.  Also, while this editing isn't the most popular among many hard-core Sonic X fains, keep in mind that this show is geared towards kids (at least in America); and despite the fact that is IS geared towards kids, this show can appeal to ""older kids"" as well (such as myself).  Most of the storylines are good, there is a great deal of continuity throughout the entire show, and (I'm going to get killed for this too), I love the voices.  The acting CAN be a little off at times, but it really doesn't take away from the enjoyment of the show.  The animation is also pretty sweet most of the time.

...and did I mention I was a fan of the first two Sonic series as well as all the old (and some of the new) video games?  This show is awesome no matter what generation of Sonic fan you are ;)",1180915200,,1075,4.261083743842365
2017153,5,B0001MZ7B4,"Man Sonic X is cool. Not only does sonic get warped into another world but they also have epsoides based on the games. I a littlw woried that the seires would be like Sonic Underground with all that junk but I was wrong. Also it's anmie and I orderd the orginal uncut japanse epsoides of Zstore and they are even cooler. Also it has all the orginal charecters such as Tails, Knuckles,Amy,Cream, and Shadow. There are also new charecters that are Chris,Chuck,Danny,Ela, and Matt. The Foxbox did a good job makeing this and makeing sure that Dic didn't get away with it's terbile cartoons agian which makes me vary happy.

2017165,2,B0001MZ7B4,"This show is no good to the Sonic series. It recreates moments and environments  from the games very badly. Why didn't they just hire the same people who did the voices in the games? The guy who did the cool, punker Sonic voice for the games auditioned for voicing on this show. But guess what, instead of his great voice they hire some idiot that makes Sonic's voice sound totally retarded. The show is reall corny, unnesesary, and unneeded. All the voices are bad, they add some new characters, and that's just dumb. Do yourself a favor, and just throw out any Sonic X DVDs and Sonic Heroes(see my review for that), and pretend that neither of them have ever happened.

2017166,2,B0001MZ7B4,"Kids, Theres' nothing more cool than watching Sonic if its' something you like, but if somebody tries to sell you a badly edited 4Kids version with sans intense violence and bad dialouge, and it comes off as something that makes you feel uncomfortable, thats' NO Good. Its' your Sonic, noone has the right to butcher the original Japanease version if you dont' want them to, so what do you do?

2017167,5,B0001MZ7B4,"While it's understandable that anime fans would be disappointed in the Sonic X adaptation that ran on Fox Box, Sonic X is nevertheless an excellent series in its own right. Not being a fan of other 4kids reversions, I was prepared not to like the series, but it soon became one of my favorites. From the great rock theme song to the cute style characters to the overblown plot lines to the light, offbeat humor, to the many anime staples sprinkled throughout the show, it's one of the best anime style cartoon series in a long time.

Episode one, ""Chaos Control Freaks"" (#1), starts the action right out of the (Fox) box when Chaos Control sends Sonic into a new, unfamiliar world. How many of his friends (and enemies) are here? Where lies the way home? He doesn't know. When he meets Chris, the two become fast friends, and he progressively finds and rescues Cream and Cheese, and discovers Knuckles and Tails. As in many anime settings, Chris' father is rich and his mother is a movie star, and there is the obligatory host of eccentric relatives and staff.

Having said that, Sonic X makes better use of the numerous car chases and crashes, mecha in the employ of the nefarious Dr. Eggman, and the various odd characters (many from Sega game scenarios) encountered along the way. Volume one for some reason costs more than later volumes and gives you fewer episodes: ""Sonic to the Rescue"" (#2) and ""Missle Wrist Rampage"" (#3). For some reason the bonus episode is #27 ""Pure Chaos"" which falls chronologically after ""Countdown to Chaos"" on volume six. As with the difference between Gatchaman and G Force, seeing Sonic X makes me want to track down the Japanese originals, but Sonic X is nevertheless a smart, exciting, visually arresting, imaginative series the whole family can enjoy.",1126483200,5,1789,4.767741935483871
2017168,3,B0001MZ7B4,"I saw Sonic X in Japanese before the dubbed version hit tv here.

I was a bit disappointed that the original music and many of the fantastic jokes were taken out for the dub, they were part of what made the series so great and I found the show less enjoyable without them.

When the DVD came out, I snapped the first two up in the hopes that it would include the original Japanese as well as the dub.  It does not.

I will not purchase another SonicX DVD unless it includes the original Japanese episodes.

I do not enjoy the dub half as much as I do the Japanese.

Aside from that failing, it's an entertaining show, and the DVD plays well, even including a bonus episode.

It simply isn't as great as it could have been.",1124582400,5,722,4.188405797101449
2017169,4,B0001MZ7B4,"Yo it's Chewie here with a review on *Sonic X - A Super Sonic Hero*. As an Anime Fan, a Sonic fan, and a Cartoon Critique, I give this DVD a 4 star rating. I know most people that watch Anime are Hardcore Japanese Anime fans (meaning that they only really like Anime made in Japan and in its original context). But I have an appreciation for both American and Japanese Animes. I agree with many reviewers that the American version of Sonic X (on this and other DVD's) have changed much from the original, but are still Sonic Anime, non-the-less. To get to the nitty-gritty, much of the dialogue has been changed so that not only teens and adults will like this Anime series, but kids as well (hence the placement of SonicX on '4KIDS tv'). If you are a parent wanting to know more about these Sonic episodes or are a Sonic fan, heres the low-down.<br />
The episodes on this DVD introduce you to Sonic and most of his friends, Dr. Eggman (the bad-guy if you will), and other events leading up to his appearance in Station Square<br />
(Which brings us to Sonic Adventure, originally for Dreamcast). Basically, if you have a young child they will like and understand most of what's going on. If you have a teen or pre-teen who likes Sonic and/or Anime, and they don't mind random childish jokes, then they'll like this DVD and the other ones as well.. Hope this helped- Darthsonic[JK]",1106611200,3,1382,4.488095238095238
2017190,1,B0001MZ7B4,"I'm not going to even waste my money with this DVD.  The origional uncut Japanese episodes are funny and whitty, but when this series was cut and dubbed for U.S. audiences the dialog became really stupid, and they even changed the music!  I say wait for a professional uncut subtitled release.  Even push for it!  I can't watch 5 minutes of the dubbed version without shaking my head in disgust at how poorly it was done.",1088208000,6,421,4.5
2017191,3,B0001MZ7B4,"The first two Sonic X DVD releases have come to the shores. There's a problem though, and that's the content on each DVD. The dub of Sonic X is below-average, and kind of goofy: the script varies from accurate to inaccurate, most of the cast's voices are off, the editing goes from okay to bad, and the Japanese music is replaced.
On this DVD, we've got four episodes: ""Chaos Control Freaks"", ""Sonic to the Rescue"", ""Missile Wrist Rampage"", and ""Pure Chaos"". As to why they skipped from Episode 3 to Episode 27 (even if it is a ""Bonus Episode"") is beyond me. But it gives a nice preview of the next season.
This DVD is good for fans of the dub, or kids. The price is great, so I might pick the two up. 2 Stars for being dub-only but the price (around 10 dollars online) brings it up one star.",1087344000,5,792,4.251655629139073
2017192,5,B0001MZ7B4,"The first three episodes of Sonic X, are totally cool, espically the first and third one. This DVD is worth having even though it doesn't have as many episodes as the second DVD. Sonic X just plain rocks the house.",1084579200,,214,4.375
2017193,1,B0001MZ7B4,"If you didn't know who 4Kids (who dubbed Sonic X) is... you might want to know. They are the ones who take great popular animes from Japan and turn them into crap.... just a few of the animes they have done are Pokemon, Yu-Gi-Oh!, Megaman NT Warrior, and now Sonic X. While Sonic X is the best dub they have done so far, it's no where near a good dub or even a poor dub, uncalled for edits and cuts make an anime which should be for older kids for all kids now... it's like taking ""The Simpsons"" and editing it for very young kids.
I have grown up on Sonic the Hedgehog ever since he first appeared on the Sega Genesis way back in 1991... while I am totally happy that we finally have a real Sonic the Hedgehog TV show that is an anime, I am disapported from the dub version, the voices are really bad, and they didn't even allow Ryan Drummond, who voiced Sonic in all the games from Sonic Adventure and up... due to the fact that he didn't live in NY... when he even was going to move... they put in dumb lines and voices are bad enough as it is... the music is even changed (OK, I have to admit that I'm a fan of the English opening, but still...) when will it end?
If you want to watch Sonic X, go out and look for the Japanese Version... you can find them around the net... I am not going to pay around 20 dollars for a DVD like this... they don't offer a Japanese track, unedited version, all they give you is 3 episodes that you can see on TV for free and maybe a character bios that are totally off with spelling errors most of the time. If you offer only 3 episodes... at lease give us uncut episodes with the japanese soundtrack... or offer an Unedited and Edited DVD's... which they don't...
I do not recommend this DVD or any DVD's of Sonic X Dub version... only buy them if your super hardcore fans (in which you need EVERY Sonic the Hedgehog Item) or a parent who has a child under 5 years old who likes this show. If your a big fan, find the Japanese Version of the Show. I will wait till Uncut episodes come (which will never happen)",1083974400,6,2048,4.109725685785536
2017194,3,B0001MZ7B4,"Well, 4Kids did a good job for this anime (but not all that great). But to be honest, out of the animes under the 4Kids label, this would be the only best 4Kids dubbed anime.
I mean, if you understand how 4Kids handles their animes. They don't have a really good record of doing their animes. First of all, they cut the japanese intro and make original intro themes of their own from unknown U.S artists (rather than japanese artists). Where as if Bandai Entertainment or VIZ picked this anime up, they would keep this anime intact with the japanese version (with Ryan Drummon at the helm, voicing Sonic and the rest of the crew of the U.S version of Sonic Adventures 1 & 2).
But I'd have to give them some credit, cuz this'd be the only anime I would watch that's from 4Kids. The rest of 4Kids animes would be a waste of money (except for the Pokemon movies).",1078358400,3,860,4.3478260869565215
2017195,2,B0001MZ7B4,"I've been a hardcore Sonic fan for years, and finally we have a new anime based on the hedgehog. Unfortunately, as someone who has seen and owns the Japanese version on DVD, I can't really recommend this to only but the hardcore fans. The show suffers from bad editing. (Most notable is the absence of the Japanese sountrack, which is replaced with a much inferior soundtrack.)It's not unwatchable, however, and any hardcore Sonic fan should give it a shot. I'm sticking with my Japanese DVD's though.",1078185600,3,501,4.837209302325581
2017196,3,B0001MZ7B4,"Do you know who 4Kids is? 4Kids is an Anime company who freeloads off TVTokyo Co. to get their Anime. With this system they've acquired Pokemon, Yu-Gi-Oh!, The Star That is Kirby (English adaptation called ""Kirby: Right Back At Ya!""), Kinnikuman 2 (English adaptation called ""Ultimate Muscle: The Kinnikuman Legacy""), and most recently, Shaman King and Sonic X.
This DVD is the first in a series of estimated 17, containing the first three episodes - Supersonic Hero Appears!, Escape From Area 99, and Dr. Eggman's Ambition (The alternate titles, which are much more common (also used on this DVD), are ""Chaos Control Freaks!"", ""Sonic to the Rescue"", and ""Missile Wrist Rampage""). The episode count on this disc is disappointing - a 4-episode-per disc system would work nicely, considering the length of the entire series is 52 episodes (4 episodes per disc = exactly 13 discs). Besides, the Ultimate Muscle and newer Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles discs have 4-5 episodes, and are the exact same price - why not this series?
The dub itself was kind've disappointing. All of the music was changed for the US - the Opening theme ""Sonic Drive"" was removed as well. The new music is much more artificial, and doesn't measure up to the quality of the original. Naturally this continued on throughout the dub series. This creates a continuity loophole, as the Sonic OVA (Original Video Animation, known as Direct-To-Video in America), which this series continues from, keeps the original music. The dub voices, okay most times, can get annoying at points. The dialogue is mostly kept faithful. They kept in Sonic's PSA (Public Service Announcement) about playing in the highway, although it was twisted around a bit (the original was simply playing in the highway, the dub makes it about chasing hedgehogs on highways with racecars). Various cuts, adding up to TWO WHOLE MINUTES were made mostly for... *sighs* commercial time. Yes, because it seems that ruining the art of Anime is okay as long as you get money from advertising. I wouldn't mind if they were restored for the DVD release - there's nothing to cut out content-wise, and I don't think timecuts are neccessary on Home Video. The more disappointing feature about this disc is the lack of a subtitled, Uncut/Uncensored Japanese version. The absense of it is very disappointing, and I know sales would defenitely increase if it was added.
It's not a very good dub, but it isn't too bad either. It's watchable. In the case of Sonic X, the storyline and action are kept - something that keeps me watching.
Something that confuzzles me however - ShoPro lists Sonic X on their official website, as the distributors for the series, although this is clearly a joint FUNimation/4Kids product. Odd.",1078099200,5,2744,4.967391304347826
