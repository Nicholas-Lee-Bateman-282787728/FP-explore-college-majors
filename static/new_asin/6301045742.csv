Got it for  my sister but enjoyed the movie as well.",1357516800,,108,3.6956521739130435
318411,5,6301045742,"I could watch this movie weekly....there is so much going on in the interactions between David and Kathy that seem new every time I see it.  Martin Short and Annette O'Toole play their parts so naturally that you almost forget it is a movie.  Both actors use their body movement, their voices (particularly Annette), and their facial expressions (particularly Martin) to perfection.  The characters are extremely likeable and even though you know they both are hiding things from each other, you are pulling for them both every step of the way.  Technically, it is a rather simplistic movie, which fits perfectly with the premise of this being a single evening in the lives of two mutually attracted singles, even if this is the ""all important 3rd date"". Technically, the camera work and the film editing was very, very good in that you really feel that you are looking at the other person through the eyes of the other character...which really goes a long way towards your empathy with the characters.  You actually feel like it could be you in their shoes.  I'll be watching many more times, you are welcome to join me!",1341273600,,1121,4.782383419689119
318412,3,6301045742,"This often how I pictured my dates would have turned out.  But, none such was the case, and never will be at this point.

""Cross My Heart"" is a fun little film that has some moments of unbelievability, but also a lot of ""1980s""-ness going for it as well.  I don't have too much to say about it.  Supposed third date jitters are the topic of this flick, as well as the veil of secrecy that both man and woman put up to impress the other.

It's warm hearted and well meant.  Me, I never thought anyone would be daring to show dating on such an intimate level and with a name cast, but I guess it had to happen at some time.

Fun 80's stuff for those who were 20-somethings or 30-somethings during that time.  Keep in mind the film's rating if you want to watch it with company.",1287705600,5,775,4.12
318413,3,6301045742,"""Cross My Heart"" is an unpretentious and often humorous depiction of misrepresentation as an all too common part of dating. Though often a bit silly and unbelievable, it's nonetheless worth seeing.",1286841600,3,197,5.387096774193548
318414,5,6301045742,"This movie is one of my favorites. I really enjoy the plot, humor, and the spontaneous antics. Everyone should see this movie at least once. I can't believe it took so long to come out on dvd!",1279584000,,192,4.216216216216216
318415,5,6301045742,"Thank you for the vid. It is a used video as advertised and was exactly as discribed. It also arrived before it was due, so I have no complaints, and would happily use this source again.",1273968000,,186,4.194444444444445
318416,4,6301045742,"I get a kick out of movies like this, in that it is 23 years old and the music and the clothes are so dated, and the stars look so young. Annette O'Toole looks amazing. This was a fun comedy, and I got it at a good price.",1268611200,2,221,3.625
318417,5,6301045742,This is a funny movie and well written for the part played by Martin Short. Some of the funniest comedic lines ever. I wish they would put it out on DVD as it's a lost comedic gem in my opinion.,1121472000,6,194,3.875
318418,4,6301045742,"""Cross My Heart"" went virtually unnoticed upon release in 1987, (following on the heels of Martin Short's success in ""Innerspace""). I hope it's headed for sleeper status, because  it's a *wonderful* little seriocomedy, about two people with a remarkable  amount of attraction to each other, who lack the confidence and courage to  be open about their lives and their feelings during a third date. The  characters are three-dimensional, Short and O'Toole have a sizzling  chemistry, and the script is appropriately low-key and subtle. It isn't  accurate to call ""Cross My Heart"" a ""date from hell""  movie, because it doesn't fall into the same category as comedy-of-errors  films, like ""After Hours"" or ""Into the Night,"" where  two people are thrust into a series of disasters. Instead, most of the  characters' problems and conflicts spring from slight inadequacies and  insecurities, and they retain a basic compatibility that *will* enable them  to succeed, if they can only overcome a few obstacles and be straight with  each other. The film is a little stagy (three or four major sequences, with  the two leads carrying all of the weight), but remains touching, funny, and  relatable; it has a emotional aura over it (like Emile Ardolino's  ""Chances Are"") that is rare in romantic comedies. As usual,  Annette O'Toole demonstrates why she is one of the most gifted, appealing,  and underrated actresses in American cinema. The film is a pleasant  surprise -- definitely take a look, you'll be rewarded.",961804800,22,1506,5.148760330578512
7810155,5,6301045742,"To one of the top reviews, I certainly don't mind mild nudity when it involves the very beautiful and equally talented Annette O'Toole. The review on the box is spot on correct but a good deal of the action between Annette and Martin is  third date painful. You will wince along with  each of them as they say the wrong thing. It seems silly to suggest that Annette's character is trying to hide a nicotine addiction, any non smoker can smell a smoker especially after a kiss. I recently re discovered Annette watching a made for TV version of Stephen King's IT.  She was excellent in a cast of TV actors. So I looked for other movies of that era and bought this one. It is low budget, great talent, pretty much just the two of them in an apartment. But with Aaron Spelling as a producer, how did  he miss the on screen chemistry?  William Powell and Myrna Loy had a big hit series with the Thin Man series in the 1930s.  As one reviewer puts it, it does not appear they are acting at all but we are watching a real third date. It manages a happy ending.  And who wouldn't have 'tuned in' to a sequel to see how the on going romance turned out?  Essentially a 90 minute tv pilot which begged for sequels.  Too late now, what a shame.",1514332800,,1233,4.235042735042735

7810157,5,6301045742,"I remembered this movie from long ago and wanted to see it again. It is even better than I remember. A truly funny story of the expectations we have of others, the false fronts we put on in light of those expectations, and what happens when those fronts start to break apart - in this case in a hilarious set of mishaps. It seems very real as these two people try to figure out each other. Martin Short and Annette O'Toole both are quite believable in their roles. It almost didn't seem like they were acting, but rather we were watching them on their third date. I can't say that about the other characters in the story, but they generally play such small parts. One exception is the scene at the convenience store. That is priceless. There is a fair amount of sexuality and some nudity, but it is such a natural part of the plot that it never seemed gratuitous or out of place. The ending made the whole movie worthwhile. I highly recommend this movie to those who like positive movies, but not for the cynical or snide.",1499472000,,1022,4.38421052631579

7810162,4,6301045742,"A great ""date"" movie, if one doesn't mind a bit of mild nudity and sexual shenanigans.  For those ""transgressions"" this movie is rated ""R"".  Martin Short is great and the chemistry with Annette O'Toole is excellent.  It is a REAL look at those awkward dating rituals, wherein we often have tried to be something we're not to impress someone.  The writers and director knew that and it all turns out that being honest  and yourself  is the best idea!  Short is wonderful as an ""everyman"" kind of character (see ""Captain Ron"") and what man cannot help being drawn to the lovely, redheaded figure of Annette O'Toole (""Superman"", ""Cat People"").  Good acting, a realistic view of the world and Lawrence Kasdan's production make for a good film experience.",1429747200,,750,4.850393700787402
