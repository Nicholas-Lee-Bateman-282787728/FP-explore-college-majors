8275734,1,6304356706,"This video was very very boring.  We purchased it because we were going on holiday to Australia, and taking the Queenslander.

We had an incredible trip, and loved our ride on the train while we were there.

The video did give us a little idea of what the train journey would be like, but was just too boring to watch more than once.

If you like trains, I wouldn't recommend this either, because there wasn't much information about the train itself or it's history.",1208736000,,466,4.511904761904762
