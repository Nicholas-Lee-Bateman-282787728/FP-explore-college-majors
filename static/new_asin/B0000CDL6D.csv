1919122,2,B0000CDL6D,This is just a collection of song videos rather than a film of an actual concert.  Quality is disappointing unless you're a real diehard fan.,1401494400,,141,4.64
1919123,5,B0000CDL6D,I have enjoyed watching the tour DVD and hope that I can find a way to get my TV to relinquish the disc! This was the first time I've used the DVD player built-in with the TV and I'm hopelessly non-technical!,1394668800,,208,4.097560975609756
1919124,1,B0000CDL6D,"I was expecting the DVD to have the same songs as the CD, but it only has 6 songs on it. It says it is suppose to be 70 minutes, it might be 15 minutes at the most. I believe you could call it false advertising, not real pleased!!!!",1391731200,2,232,3.7551020408163267
1919125,5,B0000CDL6D,Been a fan all my life.  Saw them live 3 times and wish they were still touring but this is the next best thing!,1355270400,3,112,3.6666666666666665
1919126,1,B0000CDL6D,"It's really a shame that a record label as RCA edit a dvd with only 6 tracks. I don't care if I have to pay a litte more, but I like to watch a great dvd. Besides I bought this because its title ""American Farewell Tour"". I believed this is was a concert, but only video clips.",1294099200,3,276,3.8596491228070176
1919127,1,B0000CDL6D,this was very disappoing...nothing here to review...not much to this video..I would not encourage anyone to purchase this,1285459200,,121,5.777777777777778
1919128,1,B0000CDL6D,"The American Farewell Tour consists of six videos.  If you expect a concert, your as stupid as I feel.  Very deceptive to call it a farewell tour, their fans got, shall we just say, ""misled"".",1270684800,8,191,4.428571428571429
1919129,3,B0000CDL6D,"This DVD is ok (thus 3 stars).  Seller was fine.  Condition of DVD was fine.  However, the title (Alabama: American Farewell Tour DVD) is very misleading.  This is purely a collection of previously released individual music videos.  All of the videos included are the videos that ran on CMT or GAC or whatever; not any live concert footage.  We love Alabama; but were hoping for a live concert DVD (and didn't get it...).",1253059200,,421,4.698630136986301
1919130,4,B0000CDL6D,"This is a great DVD even though it only has a handful of videos on it.  The video and audio quality are great.  Between this and the already released Alabama Greatest Video Hits DVD, there are still several videos missing.  Pass It On Down, Song of the South, Tar Top, She & I, High Cotton, Angels Among Us, In The Mood, She's Got That Look In Her Eyes, & How Do You Fall In Love are just to name a few.  Hopefully, this release is just to hold us over until a full Alabama Videography is released on DVD.",1066003200,20,505,4.070707070707071
