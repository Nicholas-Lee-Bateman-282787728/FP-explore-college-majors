6487433,5,B00LHCJ0FQ,They are both great movies and $5 for both. What a deal!,1457136000,,56,3.75
6487434,5,B00LHCJ0FQ,"I sure wish I had found this before I ordered Pretty in Pink separately at Christmas, but since I've been hunting for Some Kind of Wonderful at a decent price for a while now, I was tickled the appropriate color to find both in a set for such a low price. This is NOT both movies on one disc...it's a case with two separate discs. The former is the Everything's Duckie edition and the latter is the anniversary edition. I love both of these movies but I'm always surprised at how such classic ""teen"" movies can really do some hard hitting drama, especially SKOW. These movies are timeless for a reason and I enjoy seeing my teen daughter fall in love with them like I did. She also gets a kick out of seeing some big stars before they were parents on television shows.  Molly Ringwald was the mom on one of her favorite shows, Confessions of an American Teenager, and of course, Jon Cryer from Two and a Half Men...now I just have to find Eric Stoltz and Lea Thompson, and Mary Stuart Masterson in something recent as well.",1456617600,,1023,4.38421052631579

6487438,5,B00LHCJ0FQ,"This is an AMAZINGLY good deal on two great movies.  These two are both must have's from the 80's and the DVD versions look outstanding and have some really nice extra features including interviews with the actors 20 years later.  The movies do come on separate disks but are in the same box.

Watching these on a Saturday afternoon made me feel like I was watching them on the USA channel back in the day, except for no commercials and none of the funny word replacements for the swear words.",1446768000,5,493,4.455555555555556
