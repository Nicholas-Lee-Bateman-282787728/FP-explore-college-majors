8161964,5,B000LJF6NQ,"Only seen this concert on you tube, but why  it isn't available on DVD I'll never know, Al Morgan was one of the great pianist/ singers, and now virtually forgotten, far as I know this is the only video of him, and it's unavailable?  He had a massive hit with 'Jealous Heart', and with his easy to listen to smooth voice, put so much feeling into the lyrics of the songs he sang, coupled with his brilliant piano playing, he was a great entertainer the likes of which just aren't around today. Surely someone must have the rights to this great little concert, and have it re issued on DVD, I'm sure it would be a hit!",1499558400,,617,4.264957264957265
