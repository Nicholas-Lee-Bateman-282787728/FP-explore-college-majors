8302788,5,B001FVK5W6,This is an excellent deal.  I love this series and purchased this after having seen this series before.  I am thrilled with the condition of this item.,1396828800,,151,4.555555555555555
8302789,5,B001FVK5W6,"The Women are loving this study.  Cheryl is an excellent teacher just like her father, Chuck Smith.  On the mp3 studies, I was missing the last study.  Contacted Word for Today and they e-mailed it right to me.  If you lead a ladies group and are looking for a new study, I highly recommend this one.",1383955200,,300,4.303571428571429
8302790,5,B001FVK5W6,These are must-see messages. Cheryl has an incredible gift of teaching that both exhorts and challenges you. She encourages women to be strong in the faith--how to be victorious and joyful all in the midst of trials. You can watch this on DVD (which I prefer) or listen to the messages on MP3. And it even comes with homework you can print to get even more out of the lessons.,1237507200,,376,4.385714285714286
8302791,5,B001FVK5W6,"These Bible studies teach women how to pray relentlessly, how to develop faith while in the furnace of affliction,  and how to prepare for eternity.  Comes with homework lessons you can print from your PC ... good for women's groups or personal devos.  I sent this to a friend (a missionary-pastor's wife in the South Pacific) and it thoroughly ministered to her, especially as she was going through a trial at the time.  Highly recommended!",1236902400,,441,4.84
