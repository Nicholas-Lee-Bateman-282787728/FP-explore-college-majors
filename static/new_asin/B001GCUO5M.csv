3601360,5,B001GCUO5M,"""Shutter Island"" is excellent! This is how the story goes: Two U.S. marshals, Teddy Daniels and Chuck Aule, are summoned to a remote and barren island off the coast of Massachusetts to investigate the mysterious disappearance of a murderess from the island's fortress-like hospital for the criminally insane.

The cast led by Leonardo DiCaprio (in his fourth go-round with Scorsese) (as Teddy Daniels) is excellent! The directing by Martin Scorsese (who also produced) (who won an Oscar for his work on ""The Departed"" (2006) is excellent! The screenplay (based on Dennis Lehane's novel, he also executive produced) by Laeta Kalogridis (who also executive produced) (who also did the screenplay to ""Night Watch"" (2004) & the upcoming ""Battle Angel"" (2011), story and screenplay to ""Alexander"" (2004), she also executive produced ""Avatar"" (2009) is excellent!

The cinematography by Robert Richardson (who also did the cinematography, recently, to ""Inglourious Basterds"" (2009, for which he is nominated for an Oscar for his work), he also done Scorsese's ""Casino"" (1995), ""Bringing Out The Dead"" (1999), ""The Aviator"" (2004, for which he won an Oscar for his work) & ""Shine A Light"" (2008), he also did the cinematography to ""JFK"" (1991, for which he won an Oscar for his work) is excellent! The film editing by Thelma Schoonmaker (who also did the film editing to Scorsese's films since ""Raging Bull"" (1980, for which she won an Oscar), she also won Oscars for her work on ""The Aviator"" & ""The Departed"") is excellent! The casting by Ellen Lewis (who also did the casting to Scorsese's films since ""Goodfellas"" (1990) is excellent! The production design by Dante Ferretti (who also did the production design to ""Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber Of Fleet Street"" (2007) & ""The Aviator"", for which he won Oscars for his work, he also done Scorsese's ""The Age Of Innocence"" (1993), ""Casino"", ""Kundun"" (1997), ""Bringing Out The Dead"" & ""Gangs Of New York"" (2002) is excellent! The art direction by Max Biscoe, Robert Guerra (who also did the art direction to ""Bringing Out The Dead"" & ""The Aviator""), Christina Ann Wilson (who also did the art direction to the upcoming ""Alice In Wonderland"" (2010) is excellent! The set decoration by Francesca Lo Schiavo (who also did the set decoration to ""Kundun"", ""Gangs Of New York"", ""The Aviator"" & ""Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber Of Fleet Street"", for which she won Oscars for her work) is excellent! The costume design by Sandy Powell (who also did the costume design to ""The Aviator"" & ""Shakespeare In Love"" (1998), for which she won Oscars for her work, she also did the costume design to ""Gangs Of New York"" & ""The Departed"") is excellent!

This is an excellent mystery-thriller that's different than most mystery-thrillers out there. This is another excellent film that was adapted from a Dennis Lehane novel. This is another hit for Scorsese & DiCaprio.",1266624000,3,2894,5.050209205020921
3601361,4,B001GCUO5M,"A supernatural thriller seen through a Federal Marshall's perspective, ""Shutter Island"" is a suspenseful edge-of-the-seat movie. A brisk pace helps heighten the tension, as U. S. Marshals Teddy Daniels (DiCaprio) and Chuck Aule (Ruffalo) are sent to Shutter Island, an Alcatraz Island for the criminally insane, to investigate the mysterious - and seemingly impossible - disappearance/escape of a beautiful female patient, Rachel Solando (Mortimer) from Ashcliffe Hospital. As the two uncover further clues and interview the physicians and staff, they quickly realize Shutter Island has skeletons in the closet, a possible background of illegal and experimental treatments on patients, and the misleading facts about the facility are hindered by hospital medical personal who are not telling the whole truth.

Parallels can be drawn to various other suspense thrillers - most notably&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Sixth-Sense/dp/B001BRZ5J2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Sixth Sense</a>&nbsp;- but they're not so obvious as to belie the paranoia or to minimize the success of the intricately twisted psychological storyline. Determining the villains and truths is the primary enjoyment while watching Scorsese's interpretation of Dennis Lehane's novel.  The plot and lack of action causes the movie to drag at times, and the ominous feeling desired by Scorsese is somewhat lacking.

The acting, however, is top notch except for a few characters.  While DiCaprio is as intense as ever - and further displaying why he might be the best young actor of his generation - and Ruffalo is adept as his partner, the staff at Shutter Island, with the exception of Ben Kingsley as a caring, competent psychiatrist, are simply not enjoyable.  Ted Levin, someone I usually appreciate, is insignificant as the warden; John Carroll Lynch is just as bland as the Deputy Warden.  And Max von Sydow may as well have looked into the camera and whispered, ""I'm cashing this one in.""  There are two bright spots, however, and they are Jackie Earle Haley as patient/prisoner George Noyce, and Elias Koteas as Laeddis.  While Koteas is scary, and his makeup job memorable, it's Haley who deserves recognition.  Just like his performance as Rorschach in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Watchmen/dp/B001FB55H6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Watchmen</a>, he steals the show when he's on screen.  Seen in a dark, filthy cell, he delivers a chilling warning with the passion of someone who actually might be crazy.  Mesmerizing performance.

There are a few minor differences from the book that can't be held against anyone involved with the movie.  Even though I really wanted a specific scene with an armed ferry to be included.  Overall, however, something else is definitely lacking.  I don't know if the hospital staff needs to be more evil, or the story needs to be more foreboding.  Either way, it didn't feel as terrifying as I expected it to be, despite the overall impressive quality of the film.  Accolades for cinematographer Robert Richardson (Inglourious Basterds, Aviator, Kill Bill 1 & 2, Casino) are deserved.  While the actors don't necessarily deliver consistently throughout the entire movie, the island itself stars in Richardson's capable hands.

Overall, a very good movie, definitely worth seeing at the theater, but missing that je ne sais quoi.

3601362,4,B001GCUO5M,"""Shutter Island,"" based off of the book by Dennis Lehane, is a frighteningly great film that continues the artistically lucratively partnership between Martin Scorsese and his star of choice Leonardo DiCaprio.

DiCaprio plays a US Federal Marshal in the early 1950's who heads with his new partner, played by Mark Ruffalo, to Shutter Island, an island off the coast of Massachusetts that houses a hospital for the criminally insane. One of the patients, a woman accused of drowning her three children, has gone missing, and DiCaprio and Ruffalo are sent to investigate. The investigation quickly leads the two lawmen to believe that there is more going on at the hospital than meets the eye. Ben Kingsley and Max von Sydow, who run the hospital, seem less than cooperative, and it becomes apparent than DiCaprio has ulterior motives for investigating the goings on at the hospital.

Part gothic love story, part psychological story, part horror story, and altogether shocking, this movie weaves a complex, paranoid story into a stunningly surprising story that entertains, scares, and in the end, leaves you satisfied by the plot twists and turns. All of the performances are solid, particularly DiCaprio, who reminds any viewer of the film that he is one of the cinema's best actors.

Shutter Island takes us to a place that no one would choose to go. When it's over, the viewer is very glad to leave, but appreciative of what they have experienced along the way.",1266624000,2,1464,4.991803278688525
3601363,4,B001GCUO5M,"Since a few of the reviews give away a bit too much, I'll stick to what will keep the film totally enjoyable for first-time viewers. If you're in the mood for a movie that goes for the quick thrill, Shutter Island isn't for you.

Scorsese paints a somber and foreboding painting that slowly draws you in, with just enough tension to keep the pot bubbling. Finally, as the plot descends you deeper into the nightmare, the rug is completely pulled beneath your feet. And that's when the film really gets good.

Leonardo DiCaprio shines as U.S. Marshal Teddy Daniels, who finds himself plunged into a world of confusion and disbelief. The visuals are dark and utterly sinister, and the score is beautifully haunting. The only reason why I gave the film four stars instead of five was because director James Mangold already shot a film with an identical concept (telling you any more would simply spoil it). Take my advice: the less you know about this movie before watching it, the more you will enjoy it.",1266624000,,1002,4.6875
3601364,4,B001GCUO5M,"Shutter Island seems to be getting a lot of love or hate from the critics, but I happen to fall into the love circle of opinion, with maybe just a foot sticking out. The story really drew me in and even though I figured out the final twist early on (it's somewhat obvious and it's a BIG one), I didn't know how it would get to that point and why.

The acting is terrific by everyone. Leonardo DiCaprio gets better and better with each passing film. Just look how far he has progressed since his weak turn in Gangs of New York (or maybe it was just Daniel Day-Lewis stealing his thunder). Ben Kingsley is always fascinating to watch and all the other big names in roles large and small put forth very good efforts, from Mark Ruffalo, Max von Sydow, Patricia Clarkson, Ted Levine, Emily Mortimer, Michelle Williams, all the way to Jackie Earle Haley.

Martin Scorsese is considered by most to be one of the finest directors to ever live, and while Shutter Island is better than his average works like Cape Fear or Bringing Out the Dead, it's not one of his best. Still, you can't deny his visual style, the atmosphere he can create, or the way he can capture the inner torment of one's soul (by using some really freaky dream sequences in this case).

Now, on the slightly negative side. I think I would have liked it even more had it not reminded so much of David Fincher's film, The Game. If you haven't seen that movie, you will probably have your mind blown with this one.

Shutter Island is not flawless in any sense, but it's a well crafted mystery with plenty of chills. Now, what idiot moved this film's release date from the month of Halloween to February? I guess SAW VI had them running for cover. What a sad statement that is.",1266624000,,1736,4.398753894080997
3601365,5,B001GCUO5M,"Martin Scorsese's ""Shutter Island"" is not an easy film to define. It's simplest to say that it's an experience - suspenseful, taut, brooding, mysterious, and engrossing from the moment the first shot appears, in which a ferry emerges from a veil of dense fog. A story that begins with something emerging from nothing is a very telling sign of what lies ahead, because in that moment, you're forced to ask yourself what lies beyond the veil in both directions. We're told that that ferry set sail from the mainland, specifically Boston, although we never actually see it. For all we know, the boat might have been spawned from the sea. Within the veil lies the titular island, on which sits a former Civil War fort that has been converted into a mental institution for the criminally insane.

The fort looms off in the distance like a harbinger of doom, surrounded by nothing but open water and gray skies becoming heavy with rain. Approaching it by boat are two U.S. federal marshals: Teddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his new partner Chuck Aule (Mark Ruffalo). Their story takes place in the year 1954, when they're assigned to a case involving the disappearance of a Shutter Island inmate. Once they arrive, they meet the institution's chief physician, Dr. John Cawley (Ben Kingsley), a calm and collected man who has an air of knowing more than he lets on. Everyone on the island comes off the same way - the doctors, the orderlies, the nurses, the security staff, even the patients all seem to be hiding something.

The missing inmate is Rachel Solando, who drowned her own children and, according to Dr. Cawley, has deluded herself into believing that she's still in her home and that all the patients and staff members are her neighbors. Her disappearance, Teddy and Chuck quickly realize, makes absolutely no sense. Her cell was locked. Her window was bared. She would have had to pass a number of people to exit the compound. The island's botanical and geographic configurations wouldn't allow her to travel by foot, especially since she's presumed to have no shoes. She couldn't have fallen off a cliff and drowned, for her body would have already washed up on shore. The weather alone, indicative of an approaching hurricane, would have stopped her. Everything about this woman's situation is impossible.

As the mystery of Rachel Solando deepens, so too does the mystery of Teddy Daniels, who seems lost within his own painful past. In due time, bizarre visions and frightening dreams seem to merge with his desperate need to find the truth. Sometimes, this involves his dead wife, Dolores (Michelle Williams), while at other times it involves memories of liberating a Nazi concentration camp during his last days in World War II. For both himself and the audience, reality becomes less and less definable, pretty much to the point where you no longer believe your own eyes. Clues lead to outlandish discoveries, which in turn lead to more questions. Everything is open to interpretation.

What, for example, is Teddy to make of a note found under a floorboard in Rachel's cell? What about an encounter he has in Ward C, a place reserved for only the most dangerous of inmates? It's here he's forced to roam gloomy stone corridors with nothing but matches to light his way, which is to say he's seeing things only in fragments. What is he to make of Dr. Cawley's colleague, Dr. Naehring (Max von Sydow), a German immigrant who asks the most sinister of questions? What goes on inside a lighthouse seen off in the distance? And what of Rachel herself? Has she truly escaped, or is she still somewhere on Shutter Island?

What makes this movie brilliant is that it isn't really about the plot, nor is it about the ending, which on all rational levels is utterly preposterous. The film's purpose, as I understand it, is to take the audience on a purely emotional journey, to consistently evoke feelings of uncertainty and terror as the dark recesses of the mind are explored. Relying heavily on the conventions of film noir, where heroes are troubled souls and shadows conceal all kinds of secrets, Scorsese doesn't tell a story so much as establish mood for just over two hours. When it comes to the mind, whatever form that may take, story is inconsequential; we can go in just about any direction and wind up just about anywhere.

Which brings me back to the ending. It may seem like a typical Hollywood plot twist, but it offers no real payoff, and that's because the reality of everything leading up to it is in doubt. If we can't trust the beginning and middle sections, how on earth can we trust the end? I don't think we should even try. ""Shutter Island"" is not about a logical sequence of events or a mechanical resolution. It's about keeping audiences in a perpetual state of confusion and apprehension (as Teddy Daniels seems to be) through the talents of the cast and filmmakers. When it was over, I thought not about the technical details or the narrative trickery, but about the overall effect it had on me. It played its game, and I wanted to play right along with it. What a captivating movie.",1266537600,,5121,4.767756482525367
3601366,4,B001GCUO5M,"This film is downright excellent. The thing is, you cannot walk out of the theater, no matter how horrible it seems for an hour. The ending comes around and all is explained, illuminating the audience as to why it seemed so horrible for awhile. Watch this movie; you'll love it.",1266537600,,278,4.58
3601367,4,B001GCUO5M,"Shutter Island is a difficult film to review. The way the film unfolds is an interesting one, but is difficult to put into words without spoiling everything from the film. It strings you along so many different paths that guessing how the film ends is nearly impossible. While watching the film, however, nothing really made sense until the last twenty minutes or so. Between Teddy's hallucinations and what's transpiring on the island, it's almost exhausting trying to grasp what's actually happening in the film and what's occuring in Teddy's head. The finale to The Departed, another Martin Scorsese/ Leonardo DiCaprio pairing, was (and still is) one of the most talked about endings when it comes to recent films. Shutter Island doesn't necessarily top The Departed, but is along the same lines. Its ending gives new meaning to at least one repeat viewing of the film.

There's no denying that I've been a fan of Martin Scorsese's films for quite some time. Films like Taxi Driver, Goodfellas, Cape Fear, Casino, and Gangs of New York are prime examples of some of the best films ever. I can't say the same about Leonardo DiCaprio. While I can't argue the fact that I enjoy quite a few films he's been in, he didn't really do anything for me as an actor. I didn't see this potential or charisma that everyone else seemed to. Until now. His work in Shutter Island puts his acting skills on display for the world to see. His devastation towards the end of the film is not only believable, but absorbing as well.

The cinematography is on a level you'd come to expect from a Scorsese picture. The way Ward C, the ward built during the Civil War that contains the island's most dangerous prisoners, is filmed in particular may be the high point as far as cinematography is concerned. The never-ending darkness makes you think something is going to jump out at you at any moment and its metal cage-like structure that constructs the walls feels claustrophobic; like you're a prisoner yourself. That ""rat in a maze"" line from the trailer really fits the film well. Everything in the lighthouse with the spiral staircase is pretty amazing, as well.

An interesting note about the film is that the soundtrack is used sparingly. I didn't notice one throughout the majority of the film. It seemed to only be used during dramatic moments. There's also a gunshot towards the end of the film that is going to make you jump because it's so damn loud. Seriously. It's insane. For an R-rated Scorsese film, it seemed pretty mild in the language department. The F-word is said 422 times in Casino, 296 times in Goodfellas, and 237 times in The Departed while it's only said a handful of times in this film. Just seemed a bit odd for a Scorsese picture.

Shutter Island is pretty confusing until the finale (basically from ""Why are you all wet, baby?"" to the end). It's pieced together slowly and is a combination of Teddy's memories, hallucinations, and what's actually occuring in reality. The way it unfolds is kind of like trying to solve a Rubix Cube. It takes time and a little bit of effort, but is well worth it in the end. Shutter Island is a film that makes you think. Remember that going in. Teddy has quite a few lines towards the end of the film that are going to stick with me for a very long time. It's a film that will only get better with repeat viewings. When it's all said and done, it was well worth waiting an extra four months for this film.",1266364800,88,3449,4.621533442088091

3601750,5,B001GCUO5M,"Martin Scorsese's film, ""Shutter Island"" (aprs Dennis Lehane's 2003 novel), was premiered in 2010, and is a brooding, menacing masterwork.  It traces the mental degeneration of an unfortunate man, and gives Scorsese an opportunity for many startling images and useless profanity.

The plot is ingenious, and one will feel compelled to see the picture twice.  The superb cast is led by Leonardo DiCaprio, Mark Ruffalo, Sir Ben Kingsley, Michelle Williams, as well as Emily Mortimer, Patricia Clarkson, and Max von Sydow.  Especially outstanding are Ruffalo (who looks perfect in the nineteen-fifties fashions) and Miss Clarkson (one of our finest actresses).

The real ""star"" here is, nevertheless, the sound-track, which was complied by Robbie Robertson from various schools of the contemporary avant-garde.  It is tremendously exciting, even thrilling.  Composers included are Krzysztof Penderecki, John Cage, Gyrgy Ligeti (""Lontano""), Morton Feldman, Giacinto Scelsi, Lou Harrison, and Alfred Schnittke.",1501286400,,1005,5.842465753424658

Suffice it to say that you'll probably get a sense that something's amiss about halfway through and that you'll have that moment when you lean back in your chair and say ""OK, yeah"".  The acting,directing and photography are tight but the writing seems nebulous - how could ALL of this seem plausible?  It just doesn't work.

This guy not only chews the scenery, he regurgitates it and chews it again and again.  This could have been a better movie if it had an editor who had the power and sense to cut it down by about an hour -- it's well over two hours and it seems like more, much more.  As it is, it just comes across as a colossal ego trip on the part of DiCaprio and Scorsese.",1487980800,2,482,4.1063829787234045

I wish I could spend more time with her other aunt, Shelly. But she lives in LA. I wouldn't be trumpeting about that right now. Aldous Huxley said that genius was the ability to carry the spirit of childhood into old age. Play, in other words. The world is not ending, and you are not alone. I'm not old. Can I sell New Zealand citizenship on here? We could use some greening. The opposition have a big PR firm from Australia. How unpatriotic is that?

3602358,5,B001GCUO5M,"I am a fan of Leonardo DiCaprio and love his acting very much. The first movie I saw him in was ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape"" starring Johnny Depp. ""Shutter Island"" is one of those movies you keep going back to. It's a psychological thrill ride with new twists and turns around every corner. This movie has one of those plots that keeps you guessing and has a surprise for you just when you think you've figured it out. You can't tell if something is all in DiCaprio's character's mind or if it's actually reality.
DiCaprio did an amazing job playing the character of a mentally disturbed psychopath with homicidal tendencies. I would highly recommend this movie to people who is a fan of this type of character and loves a good psychological thriller. It's also a great addition to any Leonardo DiCaprio film collection for his fans.",1478995200,,834,4.680272108843537

Some moments are very sad and moving, and the quote at the end is one of my favorite movie quotes.  Everyone should see this movie at least once. Just don't watch it if you're feeling depressed... it won't help with that.

The acting is top notch. The filming is beautiful.  The story is strong and moving and I felt strong emotion for the characters and their plights.

This time he move to a completely different script which keeps the audience humored and thrilled from the first scene till the last! The movie( which i saw at the Berlin film festival!) blew away the minds of many people, the plot being so strong and thrilling which kept the audiences guessing!

When it comes to acting Leonardo lets no stone unturned! The supremely talented actor has once again showed that why Martin casts him in his every movie as he is simply superb! He not only fits into the role smoothly but delivers a terrific performance every time! Sir Kingsley being the head psychiatrist of the asylum has also done a marvelous job!

The film is full of flashbacks and haunting dream sequences that range in location from the island itself to the concentration camp at Dachau.

3602763,2,B001GCUO5M,"Mediocre at its best, this movie tries to be the 'brain-pulling' type but, like all brain-pulling movies, winds up falling short. The music's good, the acting is great, but this movie definitely does not require a second viewing like so many people seem to think it does - if this movie is that complicated for you, then I don't really know what to say. The story is not complicated, even if it tries so hard to be.

Slight spoiler, if you couldn't figure out the ending the moment both of the main heroes put on the asylum's gear, then you're probably the type that tells me most indie games have some kind of grand meaning behind them when in reality, the creator is just incapable of making a real story.

3602907,4,B001GCUO5M,"3.5 Stars. [Spoiler Alert!] Martin Scorsese takes a break from his crime and other epics to make a psychological thriller in a psychiatric facility that gets better on the 2nd viewing. Scorseses sometimes muse, Leonardo DiCaprio, stars as U.S. Marshal Edward Teddy Daniels. In 1954 he and his new partner, Chuck Aule (Mark Ruffalo), are assigned to investigate the disappearance of a patient on Bostons Shutter Island Ashecliffe Hospital, a psychiatric facility on a vast cliff-lined island. Daniels had pushed for the assignment for personal reasons, as the killer of his wife may be on the island. Soon he believes the hospital is employing unethical treatments and hopes to expose them. When a hurricane hits the island, it gives Daniels and Aule the freedom to explore the case and island more, but past memories and clues on the island make Daniels doubt everything from his partner to his own sanity. With a twist ending like Fight Club (1999), its worth the 2nd viewing to see how the clues and scenes play out knowing the ending. Were as Fight Club is a little more convoluted with the clues, Shutter Island lays the clues out in front of you from the opening scene where Daniels doesnt have his cigarettes and armed guards receive him and his partner at the dock. More clues follow as the hospital doesnt want to show Daniels its records and nurses are snarky to his questioning. Scorsese employed his and Quentin Tarantino cinematographer, Robert Richardson, to make a gorgeous movie that captivates with every frame. Its also good to note that the music for the movie is from pre-existing sources. While I didn't like it on the first viewing, it definitely is more fun the 2nd time and worth checking out either way.",1468454400,,1727,4.857627118644068

3603550,3,B001GCUO5M,"Theres no denying that Scorsese and Richardson (cinematography) have created a powerfully atmospheric film. SHUTTER ISLAND is dripping in gothic noir and is visually very inventive. The performances are pitched just right for the lurid format, with a vaguely manic undercurrent bubbling beneath the surface of all the main characters. And the location and hard-boiled dialogue also add to the vivid tone of the film. But sadly the style is greater than the content. This is basically a high value potboiler, and when the denouement arrives it fails to impress, leaving a bitter feeling of disappointment given what has gone before.",1453593600,,631,5.257425742574258

DiCaprio KILLS it scene after scene... the skill and craft of all the creative dimensions are unfolding at a master level.

But it was also a good story line and the characters - particularly Leonardo DeCaprio - were engaging.

I do think this is a really good movie, even though his last line sounds more like something an audience member would say, than a person who just had his delusions explained to him. The delusional mind protects itself by grasping onto things in reality that can't be argued with, and making that part of the delusion. I have delusions sometimes, and even when I know my thinking is unhealthy, I can't be objective to myself, or self-aware enough to know what parts are not reality based.",1435104000,,702,4.669354838709677

Or are they really ALL mentally ill? And are ALL of the staff really sane? Delicious movie. You have to see it. The ending is not what you expect.

After some less than satisfying interviews with the heads of the facility (Ben Kingsley and Max Von Sydow), DiCaprio's suspicions are aroused. Interviews with some of the patients provide Daniels with puzzling information, and he decides to 'nose around' with his partner.  At the same time, he suffers from headaches and fitful sleep punctuated by nightmarish visions of his past and. increasingly, struggles with a seemingly hallucinogenic reality.
  This production is a head-long trip from film noir into the psychiatric stratosphere. Quirky, spooky, and strange. A marvelous film. Things are never what they seem in the confines of Ashecliffe Hospital.",1434067200,8,950,5.583333333333333

The first movie I saw him in was ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape"" starring Johnny Depp. ""Shutter Island"" is one of those movies you keep going back to. It's a psychological thrill ride with new twists and turns around every corner. This movie has one of those plots that keeps you guessing and has a surprise for you just when you think you've figured it out. You can't tell if something is all in DiCaprio's character's mind or if it's actually reality.

DiCaprio did an amazing job playing the character of a mentally disturbed psychopath with homicidal tendencies. I would very much recommend this movie to any person who is a fan of this type of character and loves a good psychological thriller. It's also a great addition to any Leonardo DiCaprio film collection for those who collect movies of their favorite actors.",1433721600,,872,4.8133333333333335

The movie was very intriguing and interesting AND confusing, so having it as a DVD is invaluable for watching it over and over again (at least, certain parts). I read many plot summaries and reviews about Shutter Island, and I don't want to give away its plot, but I assure you that if you TRULY WANT TO UNDERSTAND this movie, you WILL need to see it more than once; and, you may need to see a few scenes many more times.

3604437,4,B001GCUO5M,"Hmm... interesting film. Firstly, it isn't scary although there are a couple of good `jumps'; it is more of a darkly psychological mystery. Without giving too much away, it is also annoyingly reminiscent of another film in the placing of `clues' (a bit like the `red' thing in Sixth Sense) and the little deliberate continuity slips are a dead give-away. We guessed what was going on after the first 35 minutes, but the film is so well crafted and artfully directed that even after we had guessed, we were still not entirely sure that we were right until near the very end.

The atmosphere is great; lots of film-noir camera angles, suitably creepy setting and excellently acted. It is definitely a film to re-watch (again, like Sixth Sense) as I'm sure we will continue to spot the more subtle clues we missed on the first viewing. All-in-all, an unusual, interesting, strange and entertaining film.",1420934400,,900,4.8441558441558445

3604559,5,B001GCUO5M,"Leonardo Dicaprio gave a stellar performance here and the plot is great.  I really enjoyed watching this.  It is one of those movies that makes you wonder at the end is it reality or is it not?  This movie's ending kinda remind me of the end of Inception, which leaves the audience to ponder if the protagonist is still in his dream or in reality.

***SPOILER ALERT, DO NOT read below if you don't want to know the ending***

As for the ending, I contemplated about a few possible explanations.  But I think the one that makes the most sense to me is that the protagonist has been ""cured"" finally and no longer has relapses because he finally comes to term that this is the reality that he must face.  However, he also can't live in that reality anymore, so he intentionally fakes that he is still delusional so that they can lobotomize him.  That's why at the end, he asks ""Is it better to live as a monster or die as a good man"" and when the doctor calls out his fake name Teddy, he doesn't turn around or respond to that fake identity.  He feels that it is better to ""die"" by being lobotomized so he can't feel the pain anymore than to live intact but faced with monstrous memories.",1417392000,,1185,4.301801801801802

3604565,5,B001GCUO5M,"One of the most celebrated directors of our time has created one of the best psychological thrillers of our time. Martin Scorcese builds anxiety and tension like a pro, winding us through the story of a widowed U.S. Marshall who is now investigating the practices of a mental hospital on a remote island. We are, at times, bombarded with the intensity of the environment: a 1950s asylum with its blend of old-style and modern treatment practices. At the same time, we are hit with the lead characters own psychological trauma. The film builds to a climax, and we see elements drawn from such previous legendary films as The Wicker Man and The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari. Truly a masterwork by a master director and featuring a master cast (not just anyone can pull Leonardo DiCaprio, Ben Kingsley, and Max von Sydow into the same film).

The period setting is very well done and in addition to the sets, the cast does a fine job of conveying the mannerisms and attitudes of the period.

Its a shame because in this stupid stupid story is some great dialogue, great ideas, performances.  The image is kind of flat and glassy, I did not find the photography terribly impressive.  On technical level sure, but it just felt kind of bland.

S{POILER

Lazy.  The utterly preposterous explanation of the 1st 2 hours in the last15 mins could have been massaged into something reasonable, but I guess that would take too much work.  Think of the enormous resources and planning involved, the incredible risk of injury, death, etc. The writer will have you believe this all these brilliant docs could come up with?  It's what I would have done.  I'm not brilliant.

Or you could go with the other explanation, that what we see for 2 hours is reality, and Teddy has been ""driven crazy"" as part of this big old scheme.  Which is just insulting the viewer.  Modern audiences know no one is ""driven crazy"" by the events of 2 days, even of 2 years. A rational person, when seeing something supernatural or bizarre would think there is a tick going on, or they had been drugged.  They would not snap to the point of volunteering for a lobotomy.",1410134400,,1151,4.638613861386139

My only complaint with this kind of movie is that it is not the same once you watch it a second time, but there are quite a few good-great movies like that.  And for those of you wondering what genre this movie falls into horror or thriller or drama, maybe all three - I would not put this into a horror slot although there are some scary moments.

3604854,3,B001GCUO5M,"Perhaps with a few more viewings, I may develop  more of an appreciation  for Martin Scorsese's 2010 screen portrayal of Dennis Lehane's novel.
  The setting is Boston Harbor's Shutter Island in 1954, specifically  the Ashecliffe Hospital for the Criminally Insane, to which two U.S. Marshalls, Edward ""Teddy"" Daniels( a frequently, and as we will learn justifiably grim Leonardo Di Caprio) and his partner  Chuck Aule (Mark Ruffalo) travel by ferry to investigate the disappearance of the patient Rachel Solando, whom as the mystery deepens, is played by Emily Mortimer, and later, when Daniels climbs  around the cliff, by Patricia Clarkson, who hides in a cave, claiming to be a doctor trying to escape the experiments done on patients (into which she herself was made by authorities).
 This Solando, whoever she may be, was incarcerated for drowning her children, and as the mystery unravels, Daniels suffers from migraine headaches  due to the bad air, as well, as post-traumatic-stress disorder related flashbacks to his wartime experience as a firing squad member liberating Dachau(and in a confrontation with a high-ranking Nazi, Di Caprio impresses with a few lines of his own mother's native German), and we learn the roles of Dr. John Cawley (Ben Kingsley), Dr. Jeremiah Naehring(Max Von Sydow), George Noyce( Jack Earle Haley), Deputy Warden McPherson(John Carroll) will have in the matter. A storm confines them to the island where things become more hairy and unsettling.
  In flashbacks, amid the sound of Johnny Ray's contemporary song, ""Cry"", we see Daniels' deceased wife Dolores Chanal (Michelle Williams), inform him about the case in dreams. Ruby Jerins plays his daughter Rachel.
 While I generally found the plot a bit too hard to follow, although I got the gist of it, DiCaprio, who could have done well in the Silent Film era on facial expressions alone does his best  acting during the film's tragic climax.
 As the mystery is solved , however, all one can really muster  after such a journey is the tragicomic thought of Napoleon XVI's 1966 novelty chant, ""They're Coming to Take Me Away!"" as  the ""young men in their clean white coats"" help bring closure to this tale.",1405123200,2,2196,5.092178770949721

It seems crazy that the producers would miss this (as well as just about everyone else who has seen the movie).

Think about it - if Mark Ruffalo actually WAS playing ""Dr. Sheehan"", then why wouldn't the credits say either ""Chuck Aule/Dr. Sheehan"" or ""Dr. Sheehan""?

3604967,5,B001GCUO5M,"I went to see this movie with my wife back in early 2010, not long after it was released. Directed by the legendary Martin Scorsese, it stars Leonardo DiCaprio, an actor who routinely turns in great performances, with no exception here.

Afterwards, I read some of the online discussion. What I found was a disappointment. Not that I went looking for very long, but of the reviews I did come across none of them talked about the political dimension of this film. Why not? (spoiler alert!)

For those who haven't seen this movie, here's one reviewer's quick take on how it begins: ""Two U.S. marshals, Teddy Daniels and Chuck Aule, are summoned to a remote and barren island off the coast of Massachusetts to investigate the mysterious disappearance of a murderess from the island's fortress-like hospital for the criminally insane.""

As the story unfolds, viewers encounter a common narrative device: the difference between perception and reality. Things aren't as they seem, which raises the challenge of distinguishing the two. But here's what I found really strange about most of the interpretations and reviews that I read about this movie. To a one, they all considered Shutter Island a psychological study of the main character. I saw it much more as a political allegory.

Why? Well, for one thing, lest the viewer miss the point, at least three characters on Shutter Island make references to things like atomic weapons and the House Un-American Activities Committee. Not to mention that at an earlier time in his life, the main character had been one of the American soldiers who liberated the concentration camp at Dachau. Several other related parts of Shutter Island convinced me that this story isn't so much a ""psychological thriller"" about Teddy Daniels, the main character. Instead, it's more like a parable about the craze-inducing responsibility of being the United States of America, the world's superpower.

For example, why is it significant that the main character was a U.S. soldier in WWII, one who liberated a death camp no less? Sounds like American guilt to me. . . . Sure we got involved in the War. But that was only after Pearl Harbor dragged us in kicking and screaming. By then it was way too late for millions of European Jews. And it wasn't like we hadn't heard news about their plight. We just didn't want to believe it.

The good news, of course, is that we--the good guys with right on our side--successfully ended the war, . . . by dropping atomic bombs on two cities. But we would make up for any sins of omission or commission, we told ourselves. Or at least we could prevent those sorts of ugly things from happening again. How? By becoming vigilant. So vigilant, in fact, that at one point in the 1950s we were more than ready to see a Communist behind every tree. Of course, almost all of these people protested that they weren't Communists. But what would you expect them to say?

At the end of the film, Teddy Daniels, the DiCaprio character with a history he barely knows, has a question: Which would be worse? To live as a monster, or die as a good man? That's the question that won't leave the U.S. alone. Even when America exercises its power with the best of intentions--and our intentions are never so pure as that--it's not uncommon for many thousands of people inside and outside this country to experience our actions as nothing short of monstrous. The movie insinuates that if your American patriotism reacts with thoughts like: ""But what about our commitment to international freedom and liberty?"" and ""What about all of the good that we do?"" then you're Teddy Daniels, the man who knows only one part of his story, only one side of his identity.

But what other alternative is there, except for the monster to cease to exist? The ending of the movie insinuates that that is exactly what could happen in the future. The moral order, the law of sowing and reaping could eventually neutralize, lead to the undoing, of the United States.",1397520000,,3989,4.779390420899855

It's Teddy's (Leonardo DiCaprio) job to reach the bottom of these mysteries and find the missing patient, but everything is not as it seems.  Based on the 2003 novel of the same name, Shutter Island is an expertly crafted mystery thriller about the search for a mental patient gone missing at the Shutter Island Psychiatric Facility; it has shocking suspense, danger around every turn, and a surprising ending that will leave your mind blown.  From the moment the two U.S. Marshals, Teddy and his partner Chuck (Mark Ruffalo), step foot onto the island until the unexpected climax projects into your eyes, this fantastic thriller rendition of a great novel will have you on the edge of your seat.",1396483200,,907,4.876623376623376

So my comments will be restricted to the experience of watching the film.  While I am not a big fan of DiCaprio, he gave a strong performance.  He drew the viewer into his plight and ultimately had the viewer invested in his cause.  The plot does weave down a path of unpredictability.  But I found the use of flashbacks and appearances from individuals from the past a little heavy handed.  The ending while not expected is not satisfactory.  I was not anticipating a happy ending.  However, I found myself expecting more of a moral victory for DiCaprios character or at a minimum a triumph in the humane treatment for the mentally impaired.  Bottom line: overall a fairly well made and performances are strong.  But not a very satisfying ending.",1389225600,2,890,4.641025641025641

I think I committed early to the players in their starting roles and felt cheated of the consummation of that story line which, of course, never happens.  The failure of the thriller aspect is the gradual revelation of the plot twist - to have worked (at least for me) it needed to be fast so that your head was spinning at the undoing of your expectations.  As it was, there was a gradual revealing which failed to convince.  The twist could have just as easily gone the other way such that he was made to think he was insane but an event near the end made it clear that he wasn't.

Then take three blasts from the foghorn, but not just any foghorn, an extremely loud, extremely discordant foghorn.  The director wants to make sure you know this is going to be dramatic.  Follow this with myriad other cliches:  there's only one boat and no other way off an island full of the insane.  Then the guns of the two federal agents are taken, protocol you see, and, oh yes, there's a storm brewing, further isolating these two hapless souls come to investigate misdoings at the asylum.  Mix in crypts in the storm, excessively made-up inmates, a couple of creepy doctors, and soon those old Vincent Price and Roger Corman movies begin to look Oscar-worthy by comparison.

3605231,4,B001GCUO5M,"I am not really a fan of Martin Scorsese.  His films do not really interest me and ones that I have actually seen I found to be boring.  However, Shutter Island is the exception.  I found this to be a great mystery story and the one Scorsese film that I really enjoy.  It has a great look to it, great atmosphere, great score great suspense, and a great cast.

The cast is great.  Leonardo DiCaprio gives a great performance here.  DiCaprio gets a bad rap from many people because of Titanic.  I personally did not think he was bad in Titanic.  It is just that the script that he was given was not very strong.  Plus, ever since then DiCaprio has definitely proven that he is a great actor by doing films like Inception, Django Unchained, The Departed, and this film.  Honestly, Shutter Island has actually become my favorite DiCaprio film.  I even like this film more than Inception.  In this film he plays a feral marshal and World War II veteran named Teddy Daniels.  He is hired to investigate a disappearance on Shutter Island.

Mark Ruffalo is in this too as Teddy's partner.  Ruffalo does a great job here as well.  I think he does a great job in anything he is in even if the film is bad.  Mark Ruffalo is one of my favorite actors working.  Although, truthfully I actually could not tell that was Mark Ruffalo at first.  He looks very young here compared many of his other recent films like Zodiac or the Avengers.  Ben Kingsley also stars on the film as the doctor who runs the island who may be more than who he appears.  Kingsley does a good job at playing a creepy and shady doctor.

The main thing I love about this film is the atmosphere.  This film has a very eerie and mysterious atmosphere to it.  The look of Shutter Island was quite creepy.  This place really looked like a real insane asylum.  The actual crazies were creepy too.  I would not want to be around any of those people.  The score also really helped create the atmosphere.  The score was brilliant.  At times I thought the music was a little over-played, but overall the music was great.

I was also very intrigued by the story and mystery behind Shutter Island.  It was fun watching Teddy try to uncover everything.  The third act was very fun until we get to the very end.  This is the one issue with the film.  There is a very M. Night Shyamalan esc twist that I did not entirely buy.  However, it did not ruin the film for me.  Some people will probably not like the twist, but I did not outright hate it.  This is probably because I saw it coming.  I got spoiled to the ending online before seeing the film so I was somewhat prepared going in.  I still thought was a great movie.

Overall, I highly recommend Shutter Island.  It is both my favorite Scorsese film as well as my favorite DiCaprio film.  It is a fun and eerie mystery film.  You should enjoy yourself.",1376611200,,2853,4.3606870229007635

3605267,5,B001GCUO5M,"As I mentioned in a previous review, one of the pleasures of my teaching job is that I am sometimes called upon to teach a class that is out of my ""jurisdiction"", and ""Film and Literature"" is one of them. The last two times I taught it, I used Dennis Lehane's Mystic River followed by Clint Eastwood's adaptation. This summer I thought I would change things up and use Lehane's ""Shutter Island"" with Martin Scorcese's adaptation. It turned out to be a great decision; the class ate them up.

Many of my students remarked that they were chilled while reading the novel; one even compared it to reading a Stephen King novel. And this jibes with my impression (and the impressions of many reviewers here) that ""Shutter Island"", at its core, is a Gothic/horror novel. My students were equally engrossed with the film. Scorcese follows the novel up perfectly. He uses his classic techniques--the long tracking shot, the split second editing and choppy points of views--to make a truly tense and often horrifying nightmare come alive on film. Several episodes involving ""migraines"" are bleached white to enhance the photosensitivity of those headaches. These blanched scenes are often surrounded by shots of haunting darkness or blood red phantasms. The performances all around are on the money: DiCaprio, Rufalo, Kinglsey, etc. are all perfect. The result is a strangely sad film--there is that haunted melancholy that is so characteristic of Lehane's novels that translate so well into film--given the right director. Scorcese was the right director in this instance. This is a terrific film.",1375401600,,1588,5.061068702290076

3605287,5,B001GCUO5M,"Shutter Island, based on the novel by Dennis Lehane, is a psychological thriller about two Federal Marshalls who travel to the mental asylum on Shutter Island to find out what happened to a missing patient. But when the investigation turns into a disturbing game of cat-and-mouse, Marshall Teddy Daniels starts to see through the cracks and begins to uncover a conspiracy that can only end in tragedy. Leonardo DiCaprio is a phenomenal actor who keeps getting snubbed at the Oscars, especially when he deserves it, and his performance here is by far his best. Mark Ruffalo, who usually did drama/romance before this, was great as Teddy's partner, Chuck. Then, there is Ben Kingsley, who is fantastic as the mysterious warden of Shutter Island. Martin Scorsese's directing is superb, capturing every paranoia-filled moment with finesse, and dug deep into your skin whenever the tension starts to rise. The script was award-worthy, being one of the few novel-to-film movies that is just as good, if not better than the original work.

Overall, Shutter Island is a hailed thriller that both shocks and awes audiences with its mind-bending twists and turns that truly challenge your mind. If Inception was just imagined as a thriller and not a sci-fi action movie, and more confusing, this is it.

3605345,3,B001GCUO5M,"Scorsese has made a near perfect masterpiece this time. Shutter Island represents some truly breath-taking film making that truly astounds. In fact Scorsese reaches an almost Kubrickian style of film making that is a wonder to behold. Nothing about this film resembles the style of film making we have been used to seeing from Marty over the past 25 years. This movie feels more like a Welles or Kubrick work of art. My only complaint is that I didn't like the end of the story its self. I was hoping(without giving too much away) that the US marshal DiCaprio plays might have been right and it was as he first suspected. The end left me feeling a bit unsatisfied. Certainly not the fault of the cast and crew, just not the ending that I would have wanted to see(I never read the book). Beyond this, the film is a gripping, often masterful achievement. I was very pleased to see Mark Ruffalo in a strong supporting role in this film. He also played the lead detective in the superb Zodiac. His SFPD character was my favorite in that film. Interesting tidbit about Ruffalo, he was stricken with a brain tumor and nearly died, but survived after surgery to remove the tumor. Amazing that this superb actor is still here with us. I love this actor very much. Also along for the ride is Ted Levine, who played the killer in Silence of the lambs, as well as the great Max Von Sydow(father Merrin from The Exorcist). He looked older in The Exorcist than he does now, and that was filmed between 1972-1973. The guy is like a timex watch, he just keeps on ticking. Glad he's still around after all these years. And as ever, Leo is excellent (when is he not?) This film is a top notch superb production from start to finish that kept me electrified the entire way through.

3605351,2,B001GCUO5M,"Last night's bargain-rack movie was ""Shutter Island"" staring Leonrdo DiCaprio Martin Scorsese directed the film. I found the film in the five-dollar bin at Wal-Mart. It was just a coincidence, but a  couple nights  ago I also watched ""GoodFellas,"" also directed by Scorsese and a superb movie. The ""Shutter Island"" film started out rather well. Two federal investigators met as they were traveling by boat to a nearby island known as an imprisonment for the criminally insane. They were  to investigate the disappearance of a woman inmate. I followed the story for about an hour and it became more and more murky and harder and harder for me to understand. Finally, I lost it. From then on the story just made less  and less  sense.

Now, if I was really interested, I'd go back and re-view he film. Sorry, I just didn't find it that interesting. The setting seemed  contrived and aimed at producing horor. It didn't work for me. The  characters in the movie seemed like mental hospital cliches. The acting of the main characters was quite good, but just couldn't carry the story as it badly drooped. It's a highly-thought-of  film and  some of the 3-, 4-, and 5-star reviews obviously have a better handle on it than I do. I'd suggest going over their reviews and seeing if they are of interest. For me, the story in the film was not overly interesting in the first place and became less and less interesting as the film ground down to the final credits. I'd regard it as a failed film, but certainly a lot of critics and reviewers would not agree with my opinion. See for yourself.

3605353,5,B001GCUO5M,"There are a sufficiency of precedents for this movie, but that fact matters little. Everything has some  preceding model.  Where this film  stands out are the performances which director, Martin Scorsese, elicited from his cast and the suspense he was able to create. It is the kind of film in which revealing almost anything can help undo some of the pleasure of watching. Suffice to say, DiCaprio is a Federal Marshall, on assignment to an Alcatraz type of island in Boston Bay, home to a  Federal Prison for the Criminally Insane. He has been assigned a new partner; their job being the capture of a dangerous escaped patient. All but the opening scenes take place in or about the hospital on the island. Quickly the Marshall comes to the conclusion that something is amiss. What are the real problems? Who are the good guys and who the bad.

I've seen a lot of DiCaprio, since Titanic, we all have, and this is by far the best he's ever been. How he didn't win an Academy Award for this role is beyond me! The story is very strong and very smart. It's evident that they took their time with this one, in order to get every detail right. The ending is of course the best part.

Atmospheric, intense and visually stunning, the opening scene sets the spooky tone that pervades this movie.  I read the book also, and the movie does not disappoint.  This film is not driven by special effects, it is driven by the story, something I miss in many films.

Anytime DiCaprio is on screen you can look no where else.  His intensity came through, as in all his films, in the character.  Honestly, I do not think anyone else could have played his part.

Scorsese?  What can I say that begins to heap enough praise on this filmmaker?  Even in the film The Age of Innocence the deft touch of a master is evident, so too in Shutter Island.  While I prefer live theater, the advantage of film and literature is the freedom to go back and look at the entire opus (body of work) of an actor(male or female) or director.

I recommend this movie to people who like puzzles, mysteries, those interested in mental health, and most of all, to those who just enjoy fine Cinema.",1358553600,,1053,4.518518518518518
3605448,4,B001GCUO5M,"One thing for sure:  when Martin Scorsese and Leonardo DiCaprio team up for a movie, the final product is deeply disturbing.  Scorsese is a genius at presenting haunting images, while Leo is a natural for playing troubled characters with loads of baggage; accordingly the pair excels at creepiness in the blunt thriller SHUTTER ISLAND, a dark tale that will definitely have you peeking under the bed before turning out the lights.

A female inmate escapes from SHUTTER ISLAND, the home of a hospital for the criminally insane.  Two G-men (DiCaprio and Mark Ruffalo) are assigned to investigate the escape, and from the get-go, the viewer immediately ascertains that something at this eerie place is horribly awry.  Whether it's the pro-lobotomy antics of the hospital's administrators (Ben Kingsley and Max von Sydow), or the dark, damp creepiness of the maximum security block, or the goosebumps-inducing machinations taking place inside an isolated lighthouse--or the mind-bending flashbacks of DiCaprio's character, everything lends itself to an overwhelming sense of disturbia.  Suffice it to say DiCaprio's Detective Teddy Daniels is not the man he thinks he is, and the plot device that springs this snippet rings a bit hollow, yet it's still must-see viewing.  Ted Levine, Jackie Earle Haley, Emily Mortimer, John Carroll Lynch, and Patricia Clarkson each enhance a stellar cast, while Scorsese and DiCaprio aptly tweak the ""ick"" factor in a subtle, carefully-nuanced manner.  SHUTTER ISLAND may induce nightmares, yet it's a dark journey worth taking.

I love Martin Scorcese and really do concur that he is probably the greatest film maker of his generation.  However, after finally getting around to checking out this one, I was really expecting something a little more memorable.  Maybe I got my hopes up, or maybe I read too much into the eerie previews and assumed a more supernatural tone, or maybe it's that Scorcese does what he can adapting this from the novel.  Either way the final product was a better than average mystery that left me underwhelmed.  I also remember reviews claiming it had a great ""twist"" involved in the finale.  It might have been a surprising twist 30yrs ago, but in todays world where every movie seems to have a twist of some sort I was able to peg the twist well before it occurred about 10-20 minutes into the film.  It was so simple and obvious that I actually kept wondering if I was wrong or if there would be some sort of double twist, but sadly there wasn't.  The acting is great.  DiCaprio has steadily morphed into someone who can't have a bad performance and the always great Mark Ruffalo and Ben Kingsley are wonderful in supporting roles.  The movie is well made and you can tell the quality that went into it all around.  This elevates it slightly from other general popcorn fare, but only so much.

3605577,4,B001GCUO5M,"It's refreshing to see a genuine movie replace all of the numbingly repetitious Criminal Minds/Sexual Predator series on television.  (""Shutter island"" is showing on USA cable 2 days after Black Friday.)  I can just see Scorsese and the writer of the original story brainstorming this film before shooting it. Each movie mind becomes more excited than the other guy while drawing upon sources like those in my title.  Doestoevsky's ""Notes from the Underground""--which pushes to the limit questions like who's insane in a world where insanity rules and where, I, at least, am ""on to"" the pervasiveness of insanity? And since I have sufficient self-awareness to acknowledge my own insanity, doesn't that set me apart as less insane than the other inmates who imagine themselves as free agents in a ""normal"" social order?  And since we're talking about a world where God is the script-writer/institutional monarch/rule-maker, why not bring in the director of ""Through a Glass Darkly"" (Ingmar Bergman) and his filmstar/ theological quester/avatar (Max Von Sydow)? And let's borrow some of the cultish sci-fi philosophy of Chris Marker's penetrating film lobotomy of love and human memory (""La Jetee"").  Also, for good measure, let's put Alfred Hitchock's signature on it (just as he would have done) for a bit of inside humor. And let's call it ""Shutter Island"" as a reference to existential closure within our  dehumanizing, isolated, inescapable reality (which has become a digitalized, virtual simulacrum), but simultaneously gratify those viewers whose memory of a cinematic medium extends to that French neo-realist (Godard) who defined film, in terms of shutter speed, as: ""truth 24 times per second.""

It's a dangerously unwieldy, chaotic mix, made cinematically possible through an artifical, Gothic mis-en-scene, all of which is captured on non-realistic, grainy, high-contrast film stock in addition to montage that, more than recent similar products, virtually ""ferries"" the spectator between the external world of the protagonist's present and the psychological, internal world of his past.  And to a great degree it all works.  Unlike the irrelevant fantasies and pointless mind-games of DiCaprio's own ""Deception""--cinematic fluff unworthy of a grown-up's time--""Shutter Island"" has backbone, tradition, and significance--and a powerful, driving theme--that make it possible to follow the purposefully unstable narrative while making us as viewers ""care"" enough to actually ""want"" to sort through the dream/reality sequences.  We care, moreover, because we sense that somehow the position of DiCapria's character resembles our own situation at the end of the new millennium's first decade.

The paradigm, if not actual blueprint, for ""Shutter Island"" is Robert Wiene's 1919 German expressionist psychodrama ""Cabinet of Caligari"" in which we follow the struggles of the protagonist Francis to deal with a murderous killer-somnambulist, Dr. Caligari.  In the end, we discover that Francis--who is, like DiCaprio, our point of reference--is actually an inmate in a mental institution. Moreover, the insidious murderers--Dr. Caligari and his somnambulist-agent, Cesare--are projections fabricated by Francis to protect himself from his own guilt. American audiences in 1920 were unprepared for such strong stuff, and so an actor was appointed to walk out at movie's end and assure the crowd of theater spectators that Francis would be cured and returned to normal, ""sane"" society.  (This was before the rise of the Third Reich!)  In ""Shutter Island"" DiCaprio's failure to break free of his obsessive guilt and identity-destroying defense mechanisms sentences him to a far more depressing cure--the loss of all humanity and memory.  In effect, he pronounces sentence on his insane self from the vantage point of a newly sane mind.

There is a flickering light of hope when, before being escorted to the ominous tower, DiCaprio asks: ""Is it better to live the life of a monster or to die as a good man?""  His partner (actually, his psychiatrist) momentarily sees this as a sign of hope for the man who up to this point had denied his identity-- and the shrink appears about to delay DiCaprio's execution (or brain operation).  But its a cruel hoax that Scorsese plays, if ever so briefly, on his viewers.  Reality is not so easily and quickly attained--all the more so in the virtual world, or simulacrum, that is the 21st century.  DiCaprio's character opts out, choosing to undergo the lobotomy rather than carry the knowledge of his guilt.

The movie frequently shows its seams, with lots of phony studio shots (no doubt intentional-reminiscent of many B films); in fact, there's enough apparent shoddiness and even amateurism to cause the film to look careless and hasty, much as was Adrian Lyne's ""Jacob's Ladder""--perhaps the reason that both of these worthy films did not come up for serious academy award consideration.  Maybe Scorcese will try for an improved remake, or a sequel that's more willing to confront our strange new world, bringing us face to face with a bizarre digital reality that even the anachronistic postmodernists have yet to catch up with.

[Later: The film is less open, ambiguous, complex that I had first imagined.  Like its primary predecessor, ""The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari,"" we are left to decide whether Teddy Daniels is better off living in delusion and denying his responsibility for the deaths of his wife and three children (my initial impression); or whether he deserves to be ""cured"" and released into ""normal"" society (a self-awareness that the evidence in the last scene suggests that, contrary to the conclusion drawn by his psychiatrist, he has attained).  But, in fact, Teddy chooses a 3rd option: indeed, he has attained self-knowledge but does not want to live with the memory of his heinous crimes.  Instead, he ""chooses"" his own punishment--and by dying a good man, he does not have to live as a fully-conscious ""mad man"" in a society that will remain as mad as he once was.  Right or wrong, few of us would blame him for making that choice.]

[Later: This is a film I would consider for use in a film or lit class (if the opportunity once again presented itself).  When given the option of presenting their own selections for the class, most students disappoint--most recently, all we saw were post-""Matrix"" movies that seemed to clone themselves over and over again--gimmicks and special-effects that, moreover, were ""about"" nothing more than gimmicks and effects, along with the dream/reality device worn to death in pointless scripts. Even a cinematic masterpiece that uses illusion/reality to the end of the most powerful ""liebestod"" outside of Wagner's ""Tristan und Isolde""--Hitchcock's ""Vertigo""--seemed incapable of raising the filmic literacy of no more than1-2 members in a class of 30. ""Higher education,"" insofar as the humanities are concerned, is an abysmal failure. All we witness today is ""additional education.""]",1353801600,,6984,5.300724637681159

3605624,5,B001GCUO5M,"Excellently directed by the champ Marty Scorsese, SHUTTER ISLAND is a black and white psychological thriller that lets in little light as to what's really happening in an institution for the criminally insane off the East Coast (Boston Harbor) in 1954. U.S. Marshal Teddy Danials and his  partner Chuck Aule arrive at Ashecliffe Hospital due to the disappearance of murderess Rachel Solando. A wretched storm prevents Daniels from leaving the titular complex. Lead psychologist Cawley refuses to hand over records; Solando's Dr. Sheehan has left after the disappearance of Solando, and Danials and partner are barred from the lighthouse with word that it has already been searched.

Daniels starts having migraines, waking visions of his involvement in Dachau massacres of Germans at the end of WWII, and disturbing dreams of wife Dolores Chanal being killed in a fire set by arsonist Andrew Laeddis. To the viewer, all is running amuck with the storm raging, Daniels' mind slipping from reality, and not knowing if the so-called doctors are true-blood loyal practitioners. The overtones of dark, threatening, evil faces with patients attempting to warn Daniels to ""Run!"" and hurricane forces continue to perplex us, especially when Daniels breaks into another compound where a naked inmate attacks him. Supposedly, he learns from patient Noyce that lobotomies are being performed and everyone on the island, including Aule, is playing a game designed for Daniels.

Finally, we discover what's up (but that won't be revealed here). It's a shattering, unshuttered experience--and one we think Daniels won't ever understand. This is not the kind of movie you watch for a happy, uplifting experience, and a cherry on top. It's a mindful film, one that will haunt you and touch you inexplicably at different moments in your life. It will be a film you will watch a second time, but a few years down the line.

Also Ben Kingsley is great as Dr. Crawley.  The atmosphere and scenery are appropriately dark and ominous.  Also I enjoyed seeing Mark Ruffalo as Leonard Sheehan -- he was very convincing as Chuck Aule, Teddy's partner in solving the mystery of where and how did Rachel Solando escape from mental institution.  This is a roller coaster ride, taking you into dark and frightening realms, getting lost on an island with hurricane winds threatening to wipe out everything.  Your nerves will be shattered by the end of the movie.  It will boggle your mind as nobody is what he appears to be.

3605632,5,B001GCUO5M,"Scorcese movies are distinguished by an almost nonstop placement of contemporary pop music as background to the action in the film. Such use of pop music is understandable. Scorcese was at Woodstock and is credited with editing the documentary film. In the past, Scorcese's use of contemporary pop music has had mixed results. Much of the time it seems that Scorcese is placing these standard pop tunes in the movies for no apparent reason. After all, what relation does ""I ain't Superstitious"" have to gangsters in Las Vegas? Not much. The background music should relate to the action in the movie.

The most effective element in Shutter Island, on the other hand, is the choice of music. It matches the ethereal other-worldly atmosphere of the penal hospital to a tee. In this movie the music was chosen by Robbie Robertson of the Band. It is primarily Twentieth Century music of the John Cage type. The music is brilliantly and effectively chosen and used in the film.

3605646,4,B001GCUO5M,"Alot of people (both critics and moviegoers) were calling Shutter a middling, mediocre film when it first hit theaters. I guess when you compare it to Martin Scorsese's classic films, which have become some of the best ever made, it may seem that way. In my opinion, this is a damn fine movie. It does start off kind of slow, only at times. I have to say, I was pretty disappointed at how short Jackie Earle Haley's role was, considering he was one of the draws for me. I thought he would have a little more time at least, but he only had a brief cameo. That doesn't really matter because Leonardo DiCaprio completely owned this one. He was just fantastic. I've never gushed over any of his performances before (even though The Departed is one of my all-time favorite films), but there is absolutely no denying his talent in this one. His character covered every emotion that I can think of, and DiCaprio did a fine job at keeping us along for the ride. Actually, to be fair, the entire cast was perfect.

Everyone from Ben Kingsley, to Mark Ruffalo. They all give convincing performances. There really is no reason for me to even talk about the acting. It was simply perfect. As for the screenplay. It was gripping. I don't read many books (except for graphic novels), but this movie made me seriously consider picking up the novel. Now I've read a few reviews for this movie, and complaints about the music being intrusive came up a couple times. Some people said that it was distracting at times. Well, I tried very hard to hear what they were talking about, but I didn't. I do have a couple of complaints though. I actually have the exact same complaint about this film, that I had about The Bad Lieutenant. Personally, I like it when nightmare and hallucination scenes appear real, but in Bad Lieutenant, and some of them in Shutter Island are obviously not. In the movie we are supposed to believe that some of the hallucinations are actually happening, but you can tell that they are not right of the bat. That's not my only problem with them. Some of the hallucinations (especially the ones we are not supposed to believe) are just stupid. Like why did we need to see a thousand rats on the cliff, or his wife turn to ash and crumble? That's just me though. That's probally a complaint that not too many people share. And it really isn't a major problem, because it was not an accident. It was just a directional decision that I do not necessarily agree with. Nevertheless, that did not ruin the movie for me.

I'm surprised at how alot of critics and moviegoers are reacting so negatively to this film. It's certainly not a bad movie. Not in the slightest. Of course if you compare it to Scorsese's other films, it will not hold up. But if some rookie director would have been behind the camera, alot of people probally would not have been so harsh on it. I think this movie has one of the biggest, and best mind-effing end twists that I have ever seen, although it's not hard to see coming. It's still a must see. And the transfer, as expected from a modern release, is top notch. Beautifully translated to Blu-ray. The extras on the other hand are lacking. Very much so in fact, but that doesn't hinder this from being one of the better thrillers on the market. Highly Recommended!",1344816000,,3292,4.5125628140703515

Set in the gray cold war year of 1954, DiCaprio's Marshall finds himself immediately enmeshed in a Kafkaesque maze presided over by the aloof chief psychiatrist played by Ben Kingsley.  As if being trapped on an island insane asylum accessible only by ferry in the midst of a terrible storm is not enough to face, the Marshall is also plagued by his own personal demons.  His dreams are marked by the beseeching eyes and voices of the dead, from his late wife (played hauntingly by Michelle Williams) to the inhabitants of the Nazi concentration camp at Dachau that he had encountered as an American soldier at the end of World War II.  The troubled and numerous dreams of the protagonist cause the audience to wonder which events correspond to reality and which exist only in his own mind--to the point where the movie becomes something other than a classic thriller.

They only recognize the truth through the efforts of an alter ego. In this case the prison's medical staff decides to try a drug treatment rather than a lobotomy on a patient. Marshall Teddy Daniels arrives after the patient disappears from Shutter Island and slowly discovers the truth. He is the patient and now remembers why he was sent to the hospital for the criminally insane on Shutter Island. At the time lobotomies were still quite common and drug treatments were only making an appearance. Dr. Cawley has been impressed with the results and quite pleased that in this case Teddy remembers that he is really Andrew Laeddis but he worries that he'll regress once more to Teddy and send him for a lobotomy. Well, Andrew Laeddis does apparently regress to Teddy Daniels and on his way for his lobotomy he remarks, ""one can live as a monster or die as a good man"". He would rather regress from his true self and live as Marshall Teddy Daniels than deal with the memories of Andrew Laeddis on Shutter Island. The medical staff may have failed with Andrew Laeddis but did Teddy Daniels escape? After what happened Andrew Laeddis wanted nothing to do with himself and found escape from his past in the role of Marshall Teddy Daniels. Somebody he really wanted to be. Like Mulholland Drive, Shutter Island is a thriller but both films are downright strange. There are no heros or heroines in these films only protagonists and they are dark, bizarre tales. One film concerns a woman who can't escape the past. Another film concerns a man who may have done so. Are Teddy's regressions involuntary or voluntary? Is it really a failure of the drug treatment or a choice for a lobotomy by Andrew Laeddis who just can't handle the past?? What's frightening is the past that they are trying to escape and the audience discovers with Teddy Daniels over the course of the film.

3605674,5,B001GCUO5M,"I avoided this movie because I rarely enjoy horror and I heard it wasn't much for a Scorsese film.  But I had access to it one day and played it out of boredom.  It's not horror by a long shot.  Some definite disturbing images, but from the trailer I thought it would be much more graphic.

Instead, it's a mystery thriller with a noir flavor.  The plot is telegraphed from the beginning, but lucky for me I'm not really a plot guy.  Atmosphere, acting, and ethos are what draw me in, and this movie is soaked in those.

This is the rare movie where I didn't mind style over substance.  I was never invested enough in the lead character to be deeply sadenned by his plight.  For this reason, I was safely detatched and could just enjoy the show: a winking you-already-know-who-dunnit spectacle of men in hats smoking cigarettes.

I took a class on Film Noir and, while it didn't become a favorite genre of mine, I learned to like haunted, life-weary men walking around in shadows and delivering bittersweet lines with panache.  When movies like this one (and like The Man Who Wasn't There) cash in on that atmosphere smartly I usually have a good time with it.

3605697,5,B001GCUO5M,"Based on Dennis Lehane's novel, Shutter Island works well as a claustrophobic experience, mystery, and physiological thriller. Scorsese does a superb job of creating an unsettling, Gothic mood, with a music score that adds tension and effective, creepy imagery of the island. There's a deliberate slow moving pace to the film, but I think this works well to build tension and lead up to the dramatic conclusion. Some may guess the ending, or at least have clues where it is heading before it reaches the film's final minutes, but, nonetheless Shutter Island is a great film, a successful, stellar adaptation of the novel. The cast particularly shines, especially Leonardo DiCaprio, who turns in an excellent performance, giving depth to his role as Teddy Daniels. Ben Kingsley also does a superb job as the institution's Dr. Cawley.

Teddy Daniels arrives to Shutter Island with his partner to unravel the mysterious disappearance of one of its patients, Rachel Solando. As Teddy and Chuck explore the institution, and find out about Rachel and its inmates. However, Teddy learns more about the mystery and the institution, flashbacks and visions begin to surface that further complicate the plot.
Shutter Island begins with one mystery only to add on another mystery that needs to be accounted for. There are several layers of twists, but these are revealed in fragmented pieces that we put together.

As far as editions to the film, I'd stick with the blu-ray over this edition, as the blu-ray has two featurettes about the film: Behind the Shutters and Into the Lighthouse. The quality is a bit sharper as well.

Over all, Shutter Island is quite an effective, atmospheric experience and, as one reviewer noted, a film that you can view multiple time to pick up clues and meanings. Creepy and weird, but in a good way. Definitely one of Scorsese's best.

4 1/2 stars",1324857600,,1869,4.980769230769231
3605698,4,B001GCUO5M,"I don't know if it was something I ate, or the fact that my head was arced back from choosing the very front of the theatre over the nosebleed zone way up high, but Scorsese made me a sick man for two hours.

Shutter Island will make you feel genuinely ill; given its elements, some may consider that an intentional effect, one successfully executed.  Consider me in that party, at least, because it's easy to feel that the longtime director of masterful craft has finally met his match upon reflection of this acquired taste of a thriller.

Incessantly frolicking back and forth between the lines of needlessly rushed and lethargically paced, Island nonetheless remains compelling and supremely disquieting throughout, succeeding in no small part to Scorsese's homage to vintage, Hitchcockian nail-biters and his dependence upon committed actors.

The plot drags you through the muck in every which way, perhaps a little too confident in its ability to paint a picture of deception; I suspect that many will be seeing the twists just around the corner before they make themselves known.  But ""Shutter Island"" certainly has its unpredictable moments, and you'd be surprised how difficult it can be to accept anything as legitimate by the time the story reaches its crescendo.  It leads you to treat nothing as the truth, and does a good job of it.

Speaking of deception, nothing would come to pass had the lead performances not been up to par.  Fortunately DiCaprio makes one of his best efforts yet as the distraught and manipulated deputy; not unlike his career, he becomes more and more convincing and affecting with time.  It's a dynamic, powerful performance that will earn him a nomination - maybe even an oscar.

Supporting performances are maintained by some of the best right-hand actors and actresses that money can buy:  Kingsley is ace as the enigmatic head doctor of the psychiatric ward, and Ruffalo continues to let us know that he's one of the most underrated actors out there.  Longtime cult favorite Earl Haley even makes an appearance, succeeding in creating one of the more memorable scenes in the film.  And I haven't even gotten to Von Sydow and Levine; simply put, the producers are to be commended for such a perfect assemblage of talent.

In the end, I'm not certain if I can recommend ""Shutter Island"" to everyone; its stylistic decisions won't appeal to everyone, and if you're not convinced by the drama, then it can be a real slog.  But there's no denying that Scorsese could really be on to something by tackling a genre more than a little alien to him, and I personally can't wait to see more of this side of him.",1324166400,2,2645,4.820796460176991

I guess I should have read the negative reviews first.
All I can add is that I didn't absolutely hate it, but I saw nothing of real merit either.  It didn't engage me on any level.  I found it cold and detached from start to finish.  Everything about it was euphuistic: the grandiose score that never felt appropriate to the matter at hand, the mismatched acting styles that gave the BIG secret away, the intrusion of too many flashbacks (misleading clues), the dead slow pacing.....  Not to mention having to watch DiCaprio scowl/squint and misplace his accent for 137 minutes!
On an amusing note, the very qualities that people raved about were the very qualities that irritated me.  I found them more gimmicky than artistic.  Which brings this down to a matter of taste.  I can guarantee you'll either love it or hate it, or like me, not be moved to have any deep feelings for it.

3605724,5,B001GCUO5M,"I don't make a habit of watching Leonardo DiCaprio films, but the premise of Shutter Island intrigued me.  It looked like a dark and moody thriller, and that's exactly what it turned out to be.  Setting the story in the 1950s grants the film a strong film noir quality that works hand in hand with the gritty cinematography to produce an atmosphere that mirrors the psychological darkness hanging over the entire story.  This is a place with more than a few similarities to Alcatraz, and much of the story takes place during hurricane-like conditions that only intensify the lonely desperation of a place completely cut off from the normal world.

DiCaprio plays Teddy Daniels, a U.S. marshal who goes to Boston Harbor's Shutter Island to investigate the disappearance of a patient from Ashecliffe Hospital.  Rachel Solando is no ordinary patient, and Ashecliffe is no ordinary hospital.  Shutter Island, you see, is home to the criminally insane, the kind of people that society and the system - but not Drs. Cawley (Ben Kingsley) and Naehring (Max Von Sydow) - have given up on.  They are on the cutting edge of psychiatric medicine and are attempting to rehabilitate the likes of Rachel, who bought her ticket there by drowning her three kids in the lake behind her home.  The case is not an easy one for Daniels.  He's working with a brand new partner in Chuck Aule (Mark Ruffalo), the docs aren't all that generous in terms of sharing data on the patients and staff members, and it looks very much as if Rachel Solando simply disappeared into thin air.  Daniels also harbors some psychological demons inside his own head - his disturbing memories from the liberation of Dachau and the death of his young wife.  He also has an ulterior motive for being there, as he has reason to believe the man responsible for his wife's death is there on the island.  Additionally, his research into Ashecliffe makes him suspect that the good doctors there are actually up to no good at all, conducting the kinds of research and tests that the Nazis pioneered during the Third Reich.

The plot takes a number of unsettling twists and turns, as Scorsese brilliantly manipulates the audience in a number of mesmerizing ways, constructing a psychological labyrinth of sudden dead ends and hidden chambers.  Every time you think you have the story figured out, it twists away from you in a new direction.  You're routinely left wondering what is real and what is imagined throughout the film's 138 minute runtime.  It takes a great script, a great director, and a great actor to make a film like this work, and Shutter Island is blessed with all of the above.  Leo's not one of my favorites, but I do concede the fact that he is a talented actor.  Brilliantly conceived and executed, Shutter Island is a thinking man's suspense thriller that leaves certain aspects of the story open to interpretation even after the final truth is revealed.  As such, it is one of those rare films that prove just as fascinating the second time through as it was the first.",1319500800,2,3042,4.76

3605726,4,B001GCUO5M,"Title: Shutter Island
Author: Dennis Lehane
Genre: Psychological thriller
Publishing Information: April 6, 2004 by HarperTorch

Where I got it: Borders liquidation sale

One sentence: In 1954, U.S. Marshal Teddy Daniels is assigned to investigate the disappearance of patient Rachel Solando from Ashecliffe mental hospital on Shutter Island, only to find that he is somehow connected.

Themes: Mystery, detective, psychological thriller,

Main character: 3.5/5
Teddy Daniels was an intriguing, well-rounded character. Lehane dropped in so many additional details and quirks that created additional layers and made Teddy complex. His relationship with his wife was particularly revealing, although I wish I would have seen more interaction of him with his children.

Secondary characters: 3/5
Chuck was a fun secondary character, providing some comic relief while still moving the plot forward. He was a good foil to Teddy, and definitely helped to make clear the roles and limits of each character. I became confused with the many doctors around, and kept mixing them up, so I wish their personalities were clearer.

Writing style: 4/5
While I can't call Lehane's writing fast-paced, it definitely kept my interest. The writing was remarkable and descriptive; the action fascinating and entertaining. Lehane was incredibly skilled at leading the audience along his plotline, pulling them along with his twists and turns until they finally reach the ending.

Plot: 4.5/5
One major disappointment for me was that I watched the movie before reading the book, so I pretty much knew what was going to happen. One thing that I liked better from the movie (which is saying something, because the movie wasn't very good), was the spooky aspect that was incorporated in (or at least shown in the previews). That was sadly missed in the novel, which focused more on the mystery part. However, I adored the premise, and the twists kept me guessing throughout.

Ending: 5/5
Superbly done, fantastic in both execution and action. I can't tell you anything more except I adored it.

Best scene: The ending, hands down. Didn't see it coming.

Positives: Well-rounded main character, writing style, plot and premise

Negatives: Less than perfect cast of secondary characters,

First Line: I haven't laid my eyes on the island in several years.

Cover: My version had Leo and scenes from the movie, which was a little disappointing, but it still evoked the feel it needed to.

Verdict: A thrilling and thought-provoking psychological thriller that left me wanting to read more from Lehane in the future.

3605727,4,B001GCUO5M,"The film begins just as another thriller - 2 men on a mission.
Actual puzzle opens up much later - when the 'cat' himself discovers that he has become a mouse - or in trap much bigger and sinister in nature.
It is rather a complex film - better followed on repeat viewing.
Reminded me Hitchcock (Vertigo in particular) as well as little bit David Lynch.
A tight and gripping film but I will mention two points:
The film ends rather abruptly.
Also all through the color and camera were too inclined to typecast this as a mystery or a scary movie - as if something to happen; all persons in the island behaved strangely to strengthen the impression - that could have been avoided.",1315008000,,678,4.432
3605728,2,B001GCUO5M,"Plot spoiler. Do not read if you think this film should surprise you with its 'shock' ending.

There are great 'bad' films and bad 'great' films, and SI is of the latter type. The problem is film requires coherent characterization and narrative for it to be film (unless film of the experimental type no one watches). I could never embrace the idea that a psychiatric roleplay could be so realistic and yet hallucinatory. Or that hallucinations could add up to anything so coherent that they could be integrated into a narrative film. Besides it's a bit too much coincidence for this guy to have horrifying war experiences (including possibly war crimes) and a crazy murdering wife who drives him over the edge too. About the only outcome I could understand for this character, a man of action, would be to kill himself after he killed his wife (for murdering their three children). This is Scorcese making bad films, and he has made plenty of them. Surprisingly DeCaprio is bearable, but I can't help but think Ruffalo would have been better in the lead role.

In a nutshell, this film is a bit like Kubrick's 'The Shining' colliding with the 60s TV series, 'The Prisoner'. Even if you are taken and distracted with the cinematography, one has to question if the psychiatric underpinning of the story makes any sense at all. Perhaps Scorcese, if he wants to deal in pure images, ought to abandon plot the way Greenaway and Lynch have.",1312070400,5,1435,4.736
3605729,3,B001GCUO5M,"I'd heard that Shutter Island wasn't that great but I was really surprised at just how weak it really is. Leonardo DiCaprio plays a U.S. Marshall in the 1940's sent to `Shutter Island', a facility that houses the most unmanageable of the criminally insane. His objective is to investigate a patient who's gone missing. DiCaprio's character brings along a tremendous amount of baggage being haunted by his witnessing first hand the horrors of a Nazi concentration camp and the subsequent slaughter of the guards as well as the death of his wife from a pyromaniac. The main problem with the film is its total lack of subtlety. DiCaprio is driven up to the prison gate to blaring strings as if it were the climax of the film and the movie rarely lets up. When DiCaprio has one of his nightmares featuring either memories of the concentration camp or his dead wife or some woman who killed her three kids it's all handled in such a ham handed way that it's more laughable than shocking. When DiCaprio is stricken with a headache Dr. Cawley (Ben Kingsley) describes a migraine to DiCaprio's partner as being akin to having your head cut open, filled with razor blades and then rattled around. As someone who's suffered migraines even I think that's way over the top and why would he need to describe a migraine. It's a rare person who's never had or known someone who has migraines.

As I was watching the movie I kept thinking that the problems were clearly the fault of the director. The pacing was off, the scenes failed to deliver what they were trying to convey and the suspense felt overly forced. It had the feel of an inexperienced director trying way too hard. As I watched the closing credits there appeared the name of Martin Scorsese. I totally forgot that Scorsese was the director and by and large I've enjoyed sometimes loved his movies. I have no idea what happened but I know that I am not the only one who thought this movie failed. In one scene DiCaprio is interviewing patients about the disappearance of the inmate and sets off one by continually scratching his pencil on a notepad. The guy goes absolutely ape[you know what] for no apparent reason. It wasn't THAT annoying. It's like Scorsese wanted DiCaprio to come off as a master of manipulation but to me he just lucked out and found a guy who was extraordinarily sensitive to pencil scratching.

One place where the movie succeeds is in casting. The thing about Leonardo DiCaprio is that he has such a high likeability factor that it's easy to become emotionally invested in his characters. When you care about the character it becomes much more compelling when he's in danger even if the movie is silly. Ben Kingsley is excellent as Dr. John Cawley and Mark Ruffalo did a great job as DiCaprio's partner in the U.S. Marshall's. Max von Sydow and Jackie Earle Haley had small but well acted roles. The movie also has a high quality look to it although the sinister prison for the mentally insane with possible dubious rehab methods seems eerily similar to other films I've seen but I guess as the old saying goes ""there's nothing new under the sun"".

What kept me watching the movie was the mystery but the ending telegraphs itself about half way through and the conclusion makes the rest of the movie seem highly unlikely. I would not call this a terrible movie but I'd call it a poorly executed movie. I'll bet a lot of people enjoyed this movie but it just didn't work for me. One last aside; I like Leonardo DiCaprio as an actor but he really needs to quit trying to grow facial hair. It's just not working.",1311811200,6,3583,4.604068857589985
3605730,2,B001GCUO5M,"""Shutter Island"" is a mystery with a twist, and I don't want to give it away.  So, I won't go into a lot of detail about the plot.  Leonardo DiCaprio and his partner travel to an institution for the criminally insane on an island, and nothing is as it seems.

As my wife put it, about 60 minutes in, you know it's going down one of a few paths, all of which are cliches.  Sure enough, an hour and 15 minutes later, she was proved right.  The problem with the twist ending in the 21st century is that we've all seen a ton of movies with twist endings, and it has become harder and harder to actually surprise the audience.  Also as my wife put it, there's a good movie buried in here somewhere.  The characters are interesting; the idea of a mental hospital at the dawn of modern psychiatry is interesting; and the location is fantastic.  Strip away about 30 minutes from this languidly-paced film, do a few more drafts of the script, and this could be a winner.  The way Hollywood works, the remake/reimagining in 2030 will win an Oscar.

On the plus side, DiCaprio turns in a tour de force performance, as usual.  The guy is a fantastic actor, and this is an actor's film.  If you like watching a great actor do amazing things with a character, you will enjoy this movie.

At best, ""Shutter Island"" is worth a rent.",1311811200,23,1316,4.344262295081967

Perhaps some can but there is absolutely no need to go to movies to be bothered with such hocus pocus.  Try linking the beginning of this movie and its end -  the two have absolutely nothing in common.  That's the major problem of this movie - it only exists for real in the head of its scenarist.  Scorsese skillfully directed although with lots of quite cheap horrors tricks (rats, hurricane), a forgettable piece in his career.  Di Caprio and Ruffalo do well, the best part of the feature.  There is so much cockiness in other roles and such posturing that I find it really hard to bear (not actors' faults though).

3605735,5,B001GCUO5M,"*spoilers* It just suddenly hit me out of the blue today that this movie is a great movie for normal people to understand a paranoid schizophrenic in general. The intense looks and the delusions suffered by Leonardo DiCaprio with a trauma in his life taking center stage over and over again. From my personal experience, traumas resurface during schizophrenic episodes. While lost in your own deluded world, hearing voices and possibly seeing things, you do notice things in the real world as you walk about and encounter people and places. He was able to notice things like his ""partner"" not being able to handle a gun in its holster properly and men's shoes in the room that was supposed to be the female patient's room. If this was a real life situation, while already crazy, things like that would be driving the character mad as he tried to figure it out and was exploring possible explanations. I love the ending where he is alright and does know what is going on, but chooses to fool the doctors so that they give him the lobotomy (if I remember that correctly as being the procedure they would give him if this radical attempt to fix his sanity failed). I know firsthand when I am in one of those paranoid schizophrenic episodes and start getting better, I would choose to be given a procedure if it would take away the schizophrenia forever. I would not choose a lobotomy as I have read things about them since the time frame this story took place in and they are not often given anymore, I believe. If there was a procedure, however, where I could be myself, but not remember any of the schizophrenic episodes and have the schizophrenia taken away forever, I would choose it. No normal person can begin to understand the schizophrenic experience and how hard it truly is. I believe it is the most difficult illness in the world as it takes away your mental sanity and can radically change even your firm, long held beliefs in the blink of an eye. You change overnight into someone else yet to everyone, you are still you. Then, if you recover and regain sanity, it is so very difficult having to relive over and over again things you did when you were in a schizophrenic episode when your memories recall them. This movie is a way for normal people to get an idea of hard a schizophrenic episode can be and how they can recur over and over again. Leonardo DiCaprio was perfect in this role. I cannot even comprehend another schizophrenic's experience as they are each so highly individual even though they may share some commonalities. Intense emotions sometimes, isolation as you are the only one who can hear what is going on nonstop in your mind, delusions that feel so real and seem to make sense until you become sane if you become sane again. If you don't care to know, it's just one heck on an entertaining movie. I upgraded my rating from 4 stars to 5 stars.",1308441600,,2876,4.564796905222437

Leonardo DiCaprio and Mark Ruffalo play two federal marshals circa the 1950s who've been sent to an isolated institute for the criminally insane, run by Max Von Sydow and Ben Kingsley, to investigate the mysterious disappearance of one of the patients there, a Medea-like figure who killed her own children a number of years back.  DiCaprio's character is also haunted by memories and dreams of his young wife (Michelle Williams) who died in a fire, and by his own traumatizing experience liberating Dachau at the close of World War II.  The two investigators soon discover that everything is not quite what it appears to be on Shutter Island and that indeed something quite nefarious and sinister may be going on there.

Ever the agent provocateur, Scorsese brings a healthy dose of his trademarked purple-prose filmmaking style to the proceedings.  He sets his tale against a backdrop of howling winds, crashing waves and falling trees, punctuated by thundering chords pounding away on the soundtrack.  It may make the movie seem preposterously pretentious at first, but we soon learn that there is a method to Scorsese's madness, as what appears initially to be gratuitous showmanship on the part of the director becomes an integral part of the work once the details of the story emerge.

This theme of who-is-truly-mad-and-who-is-truly-sane in this world has been played out many times before in the movies, but ""Shutter Island"" brings a level of sophistication to it that is really quite impressive.  The movie keeps us guessing at every stage of the drama, with the twists and turns of the storyline drawing us ever deeper into the surrealistic, fractured world it's created for itself.

DiCaprio and Ruffalo both turn in outstanding performances, but this is Scorsese's movie all the way.",1308182400,,1905,5.135922330097087

3605742,5,B001GCUO5M,"What makes films like SHUTTER ISLAND so exceptional is that perfect blend of subject matter, imagery, music, settings.  The combination of all these different elements makes these films memorable and sets them apart from the films you see and forget about almost immediately.  SHUTTER ISLAND, like THE SHINING, APOCALYPSE NOW, THE GHOST WRITER, THE GODFATHER, AMADEUS, THE EXORCIST, EYES WIDE SHUT, 2001, VERTIGO, to name only a few, keep haunting you afterward, and I think this is because they have, above all, atmosphere.  A strong premise, great acting, unique sets, compelling image and sound, but in particular an original approach by cleverly combining all the tools of the craft to create that strong atmosphere makes these films so much more.  Take, for instance, the use of music in SHUTTER ISLAND.  It's brilliant.  Every time I listen to the soundtrack now (just take the menacing Penderecki piece - Passacaglia) I want to see the film again.  This isn't always the case, and when it happens I know it's a film that may only get better with more viewings, even though you know how it ends.  Take, also, the sets:  the use of the madhouse, the island, the lighthouse.  Again, Scorsese has created something special by paying attention to every detail (weather - the storm!), and made the sort of film you escape into for a couple of hours and which afterwards feels like a memory of something you truly experienced, whether scary, blissful, exhilarating, disturbing.  I think this is because these films grab you not only on a conscious level but also on the subconscious one. Splendidly executed!",1303948800,,1608,4.98501872659176

3605768,4,B001GCUO5M,"""Shutter Island"" was actually a pretty good film. It has a great 1954 setting and while the ending is a bit cliche for psychological thrillers (hope I didn't give much away), it really is worthwhile. The first time I saw it, I was a bit underwhelmed. I thought it really wasn't worth for watching again, but almost a year later, it's actually a good movie. The cinematography was one of my favorite things in the film, also. Some scenes look full of color and detail and some scenes look drained in color, with only one thing in color (similar to Schindler's List).
  The setting was also great. It had good acting, and explains a lot (it IS 2 hours long). The island does look really creepy, along with some of the patients with their disturbing stories and a couple with freaky-looking faces. All of the scenes are executed extremely well and there are different things that make the film Oscar-worthy (although it didn't get nominated), but it still doesn't take anything away from the fact that it's a well-crafted film. Some of the scenes are also pretty disturbing and have an eerie vibe to them. There is an amazing climb-up of subtle scares and intense sequences into it's shocking finale (I guess it's kinda shocking in a couple ways).
  ""Shutter Island"" is a movie any detective-mysery, thriller, or horror fan should see. It's a great film that wouldn't be torture to watch a few more times, unless you can't stand movies that are a bit on the long side, but if you like 2 hour movies, then you should probably see it.",1301443200,,1529,4.610294117647059

3605770,3,B001GCUO5M,"This is a decent movie -- which puts it at the low end of the spectrum for a Scorsese film.  I thought DiCaprio's performance was also subpar for the movies he's done lately.

* SLIGHT PSEUDO-SPOILER ALERT *

Plot-wise, this is one of those movies that probably would have been revelatory if it had been made, I dunno, 30 years ago.  As it is, audiences have been trained to expect at least one twist in any kind of suspense plot, so what comes across to the characters as a surprising turn of events really isn't surprising at all to most viewers.  Case in point: if you're watching a movie about some sort of elaborate heist made at any point in recent memory, you basically know someone's going to get double-crossed.  It doesn't register to you as a twist until that double-cross is revealed as all part of somebody else's triple-cross, and there's maybe even a quadruple-cross going on.  This movie felt to me like it stopped at the double cross and then went, ""Ta-da!""

Other reviewers have made good points about it not being all about the twist, but I ultimately disagree.  The movie itself seems preoccupied with the question of what's going on, and once you know definitively, there's not a lot left to care about.  Yeah, there's some psycho-drama here, and asking of big questions, but I've seen that done better in lots of other movies, including Inception with DiCaprio in the same year.  And that movie was a lot more fun to watch.  (Christopher Nolan also did Memento, another movie that did the cerebral parts of this movie way better.  I think Scorsese should stick to crime and stylistic violence; he does those better than anybody else.)

What really bothered me about this movie, though, is that DiCaprio just doesn't convince me at all in his part as a tough guy everyman.  His mannerisms and facial expressions look to me like someone doing an impression of a '50s tough guy rather than someone actually smoking or grimacing or whatever.  He constantly thrusts his lower jaw forward to look salt-of-the-earthier, and it does not work.  Really, his performance in this movie could be summed up as his role in Inception plus an impression of Marlon Brando in ""On the Waterfront"".",1300233600,2,2199,4.714659685863874

A patient has escaped, and the head psychiatrist, Dr. Cawley, wants Teddy and his partner to find out what happened to her. While Teddy hears about how that woman ended up on the island in the first place, he starts seeing strange visions about his time in the military. And he constantly hears stories about the psychiatrists practicing corruption and violating ethical codes. What's right and wrong is a recurring theme in this movie.

The story can get really confusing at parts. There was at least one scene in the movie that did not make sense to me even once I had sat through the whole film. Even the ending is somewhat ambiguous so the audience can come to their own conclusions. But I would say it's worth the watch.

These same people didn't get ( understand ) the movie fight club by stating. i don't get it. whats the big deal with the movie that deals with fight clubs?

Shutter Islnad is just like that. You have to pay attention to the dialogue. If you have to stop to go to the bathroom or get some popcorn or ice cream then pause the movie because if you miss one line in this flick there's a big hole in the plot when you get back.

Use your brain. follow along. At the end you'll find out who Tyler Durden really is..... oopsie. thats fight Club talking.

The movie is ""Popcorn"" okay and watchable, and it's NO surprise why it was a such a huge box-office hit. But ironically, the twists and turns of the adapted screenplay (I haven't read the novel), most especially the twist at the end, is MUCH closer to the now too-familiar style of M.

3605791,4,B001GCUO5M,"You ever sit down to watch a film, mainly because someone has raved a particular performance and you really want to see what all the hype was about, only to find yourself scratching your head over that said performance, wondering how it is that anyone found it `rave-worthy'?  You're sitting there staring at the screen waiting for that moment when it all comes together, you know...that `ah ha' moment, but the movie is nearly over and you still haven't seen it yet.  You're just about to give up all hope and then it happens.  You're awestruck but what you're witnessing, and suddenly it all makes sense and you realize just how GENIUS the performance was from start to finish.

I had one of those this year.

With Oscar nominations due to be announce next week, I've given a lot of thought to performances that are NOT going to be nominated but really should.  Colin Farrell's subtle yet moving work in `Ondine', Kirsten Dunst's stunning work in the train-wreck of a movie `All Good Things', JULIANNE MOORE IN `THE KIDS ARE ALL RIGHT'...and right up there is a brilliantly crafted performance by Mr. Oscarless himself; Leonardo DiCaprio.

`Shutter Island', the film, is a little uneven for me to completely rave.  It has its moments, and when Scorsese does it right he nearly nails it, but the films textures are a tad mismatched for me to buy it completely.  The whole noir vibe seems to overlap the horror aspects of the film without meeting them for a full mesh; and the films overall construction is far too revealing to be fully effective (those flashback sequences were just a total mess).  I had previously read the novel, and so I knew the ending (which is pretty clichd, if you ask me) but the film doesn't try and shield you from the truth at all.  It basically hits you over the head with the eventualities which take away from the sting.

That said; it is within that ending that Leonardo DiCaprio does something remarkable.

Throughout most of the film I found Leonardo to be serviceable at best; but to be honest I kind of leaned towards `this performance is downright bad'.  He was a poor mans Humphrey Bogart and it showed.  His accent work was a tad spotty (no where near as consistent as in `The Departed' yet no where near as dreadful as in `Blood Diamond') but overall he just came across like a bad actor.  His reactions to situations played too heavily on the `amateurish' side of things.  You could see right through him.  He seemed so out of place.  As the film continued to delude into preposterous scenarios (it is pretty faithful to the novel, which was also too obvious for its own good), DiCaprio continued to strip away any credibility to his character.  Granted, I knew the eventual outcome and so maybe that's why DiCaprio was so `obvious' to me, but it still bothered me.

And then there was that moment, in the lighthouse, where Teddy's world came crashing down.

In a gutting sequence of raw human abandonment, Leonardo transforms Teddy into Andrew and delivers enough shocking reality to the screen to mask the fact that we saw this coming a mile (two miles even) away.  Yes, the shtick is gone; the scared, confused man pretending to be something he's not is thrown completely out the window and instead we have replaced him with a man very much inside his own private torment.  The anguish on his face as the falsified tremors start to take on a more honest tone is ever reaching.  And then comes the dreaded flashback that has been hinted at from the moment the film started, when the `truth' is revealed.  In that moment, DiCaprio `goes there' in every sense of the word.  His gut reactions are pure and understandable.  His complete collapse is everything it needed to be to sell the moment.

His sobbing mirrored mine, so I knew it was legit.

And here is the most remarkable part of all.  As I watched him completely flip his character and the way he was approaching him it shed so much light on the character he had created, the character that Andrew had created.  Every moment of the film where I felt Leonardo was phoning it in or where I felt he was in over his head were now moments where I felt he was, without question, flawless.

He built a character within a character within a character; take that `Inception'.

In the end, I wish I could pimp this out for the Oscar this year, but my opinion carried no weight.  If DiCaprio could just pull out a surprise nomination; oh how wonderful that would be.  What he accomplished here was no easy task, for his character shifts create tonal shifts in the entire film.  He controls where this film goes, for the better.  He understands that only he can elevate this film, and he does it with an ease that is undeniable.

3605838,4,B001GCUO5M,"`Shutter Island' is a thriller set in the fifties which follows two US Marshals who are investigating an escape at an institute for the criminally insane. The asylum is on an island and they get stranded there after a big storm sweeps in after their arrival. They have to work out how the patient escaped and what other sinister things have been occurring on the island before it is all too late. Di Caprio plays Edward Daniels, one of the Marshals, who is also traumatised by his past during and after the war and he relives some of this history via flashbacks throughout the film.

This had a dark, sinister feel to it from the word go and you are very quickly drawn into the intrigue and mystery on the island. You are unsure whether the head doctor is trustworthy or not and the other patients also add a surreal element to the proceedings. Everyone plays their roles very well and Kingsley is especially noteworthy as the head doctor. This is excellently directed by Scorsese and the soundtrack also adds to the tension, as any good score should.

This has a twist in the end, that although fairly predictable, still ties things up neatly and gives you food for thought long after you've finished watching. More and more scenes become clearer as you think back and characters motivations make more sense.

3605842,5,B001GCUO5M,"This movie is one of my absolute favorites. It is not often that I buy movies unless they are a movie I really enjoy, so this was one of them! The movie basically takes place at a mental institution where the main character (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his partner are told to investigate an escaped patient. She was said to have ""vanished through the walls"" so they are basically trying to figure out what could have possibly happened to her. She could not have gone very far, seeing as the mental institution is located on an island that is miles and miles away from any nearby land. As the story continues our main character begins to realize things are a little strange. Things are not as he originally thought they were.

That is as far as I will go with that. I do not want to give out any more information, otherwise it'll ruin the movie for those reading my review. I will say this though. Throughout this movie you will continually question everything that is going on. Even by the end of the movie, when you figure out the conclusion to it all, you will still look back and wonder what certain things meant or why it happened the way it did or why certain characters behaved the way they did.

All in all, if you are a person who loves to view a film multiple times in order to figure out what everything meant, then this movie is for you. I myself enjoy watching a film repeatedly if it means I'll learn something new with each viewing, so I enjoyed this movie. It is one of my favorites!",1293667200,2,1494,4.351254480286738

3605846,1,B001GCUO5M,"I am so glad I got to see a library copy before I went out and bought this movie. It is a really bad movie. The plot is corny and unbelievable. It wasn't gripping or scary or anything besides boring. I found myself fast forwarding through much of it. Why would a simple cop with no special Arnie Schwarzenegger type training and who was in on the liberation of Dachau, yet who suffered no PTSD from this, go bonkers because his mentally ill wife killed his kids, kill her and then go insane himself, thereby becoming one of the most dangerous men in America, so dangerous that he needs a lobotomy to save the rest of us from him? Since he keeps looping like the guy in Groundhog Day, I say, leave him to it. And the crimes that brought the other people to this Shutter Island, a place for the most criminally insane people in America, so insane they cannot be held anywhere else, are laughable by today's standards. Even by the standards of the 1950s, they are laughable. We had the guy who used to kill and eat people, dressing them out like deer, in a hospital for the criminally insane right in the middle of our town. He was there until he died.
They missed the boat on this movie. I thought it was going to blow the lid off the bad things that used to (and maybe still do) happen in mental institutions, or the secret Nazi experiments in the US (we gave top Nazis a pass for their crimes in return for their sharing their knowledge with us), or the terrible things we did and do in the name of healing the mentally ill (the guy who invented the lobotomy just stuck an ice pick at random in people's heads, through their noses, I believe). Instead, it turns out the cop is the bad guy and the Nazi looking doctors and police are the good guys. What gives with this?
Personally, I think it is not worth watching. Borrow it from the library or rent it before you decide whether you want to plunk down dollars for it.",1293321600,15,1918,4.2865013774104685
3605847,2,B001GCUO5M,"There are two ways to look at ""Shutter Island"".

If an average director made it, then it would be a pretty decent movie. However, since it was made by Martin Scorsese, I expect a lot more. When you are among the best directors, you have high expectations...which I felt that this movie did not fullfill. This movie looks a lot better in the trailer than it did played out over it's full length.

Most of ""Shutter Island""is pretty good, as far as the casting (Leonardo DiCaprio and Ben Kingsley are great), the scenery is effective, and the sound lends to the atmosphere.

I just thought that the story was lame (NOTE, I am purposely not going into the plot since it will impact/reveal the mystery). When the film is all done, you feel as though you watched a ""Scooby Doo"" ending.

This atmospheric movie is a weak Scorsese film. It would best be compared to ""Cape Fear"" whic was far more effective.",1293148800,7,898,4.5246913580246915

I knew what was going to happen but i still enjoyed watching the movie. People just get soo caught up in the ending, how would you of liked it to end? I'm sure if it was ended a different way it would still be ""cliche"", ""predictable"" or ""confusing"".",1292198400,,664,4.1875
3605850,4,B001GCUO5M,"The setting: 1954. A deliciously forboding rocky island 11 miles from Boston, home to a mental institution for the worst of America's criminally insane.

The plot: Two federal marshals arrive as a storm is brewing, to investigate the disappearance of one of the patients. It soon becomes clear to the cops that it's not just the patients who are spinning tales around here.

The ambience: Gloomy, gothic, and menacing.

Cast and characters: Leonardo DeCaprio as senior investigator Teddy Daniels, a WWII vet whose wife died in a fire a few years after he returned home from the war. Moody and still reeling from his traumatic experiences, Daniels rapidly becomes suspicious about what's really going on, in secret, of course, on Shutter Island. Mark Ruffalo as Daniels' partner, allowing him to take the lead. Ben Kingsley as the chief medical director, a man of subtlety and ambiguity, concerned for his patients and devoted to dragging the treatment of the insane out of the dark ages. Michelle Williams, playing the ghost of Daniels' wife, who haunts his dreams, waking and sleeping. Finally, there's an array of creepy denizens among the nurses, orderlies, inmates, and guards, to create and maintain the sense of doom and hopelessness.

Whether or not you guess the ending early on (I must confess I did not), Shutter Island is a first rate production. Its visuals, though often bleak, are stunning, particularly the steel maze that is the high security building and the craggy cliffs on the backside of the island.  Scorsese's technique of layering flashbacks into present day action ratchets up the viewer's sense of anxiety along with Daniels', till it isn't always possible to differentiate fact from dream from hallucination. Scorsese has become every bit as skilled as Hitchcock in creating restrained horror.

3605873,5,B001GCUO5M,"************************************SPOILER ALERT****************************
***DON'T READ THIS REVIEW BEFORE SEEING THE MOVIE****************************

This is a difficult movie to describe and that's a compliment to Mr. Scorsese. He's created an eerie thriller that's also a homage to Hitchcock and Kubrick and lots of other great cinematic influences as well as every excellent film noir ever made. It starts off in a surrealistic, dreamlike manner: Leo is seasick below deck on a small ship and is mightily struggling to hold his sanity together. He's a U.S. Marshall and he then meets his new partner Chuck topside, seemingly for the first time. They never met before this moment? And the backdrop seems blatantly fake - the ocean is all around them but the deck never moves. Is this Mr. Scorsese's small tribute to Hitchcock and his sometimes oddly obvious sets or is the scene a fantasy of some sort? So right away the audience is confused and unsure, and only gets more so when Chuck fumbles with his pistol and holster and seems completely unfamiliar with them. Their investigation then encounters nothing but obfuscation and denials and contradictions. The situation spirals into ever-increasing weirdness, complete with mazelike corridors and winding staircases and Leo's extremely disturbing flashbacks. What's real? Who's real? Who's crazy? Who's sane? The viewer is on unsteady ground that constantly shifts underfoot the entire time.

SI also has some of the finest acting around. The supporting cast is uniformly superb: Michelle Williams, Ben Kingsley, Max Von Sydow, Mark Ruffalo and Jackie Earle Haley as well as all the minor characters and an uncredited DeNiro cameo. It's necessarily hallucinatory because most of it takes place inside an insane man's tortured mind. Mr. Scorsese deserves a lot of credit for crafting something so original out of such derivative material and he definitely knows how to hold an audience's interest. He's also a victim of his past successes - some people seem to expect ""Raging Bull"" or ""Taxi Driver"" every time out. SI is a very creepy, disturbing movie that takes close attention to follow and features a very flawed and non-dynamic hero.

Sometimes you're in the mood for a big juicy steak and a baked potato and a few ice-cold beers and other times all you want is a bag of microwave popcorn and a can of Pepsi. This is a steak-type movie, that's all.",1291680000,,2413,5.182051282051282

While everything appears to be normal, as far as normal would go for a mental institution in the 1950s, there is always an unsettling element in the mix. The music and the camera angles used also assist greatly is setting the mood for this film.

This movie unfolds like a maze, and it has you going down different rabbit holes, firstly, there is the issue of the missing female patient, that has disappeared under almost an impossible situation. Then there is a former Nazi doc, that raises the question of experimental brain surgery.

The suspense develops as the weather deteriorates, the Federal Marshals get soaked in the rain and must dodge falling trees. Subsequently, they are provided with in-mate clothes and now sleep in bunk beds provided. The question that now presents itself, is: will they ever be allowed to leave the island? More questions and paranoia is thrown into the mix to keep you at the edge of your seat.

This is a very gripping suspense thriller and keeps the maze going, and blurs reality and hallucination until the very end. A great movie that keeps you thinking as the plot turns and bends.",1290556800,,1175,4.721951219512195
3605877,2,B001GCUO5M,"Look guys, I do get it. The film is a study of insanity before a thriller/horror. Doesn't make it good. Furthermore, if you read the book you'd see my point.

I read the book nearly a year before the film got released and I loved it. Quite possibly the most edge-of-your-seat book I read in a long time!!!! Furthermore when I saw the trailer and heard Scorsese would be doing the film adaptation I got ecstatic. Scorsese is one of the best filmmakers, and he directed my favorite film of 2006- The Departed. That movie was just spectacular, and it changed the way I saw movies forever. It blew my then-teenage mind, and I'll never forget the first time I saw it.

So could tell, I was excited, and flocking to the theatre on opening day, I was ready to place this at the top of my list.

The film is true to the book, yes. Is that a good thing? It depends. I was happy they stuck with the book, as basically it seemed like they used the book as the film's screenplay.

However, I have the feeling that this would be a one star review if I hadn't read the book. For one, even my girlfriend, who hadn't read the book, knew the ending about 10 minutes in. The plot worked well in the book, but as a movie, just simply fails, again showing that not all books that are great make good movies. The movie is pretty alright, as it is lush and colorful in a few scenes and at times even seems like a gothic horror film.  Again, pretty pictures does not equal good movie.

Another thing ruining the film is its ""punch in the face"" musical score. Come on, the score was ridiculous. Spooky tingling piano music!!! Nazi-marching-into-town-music!!! LOUD BRASS music!!! Whoever did the score needs a kick in the teeth. The murder scene near the end was hilarious due to the inappropriate spooky tingling piano music.

3605880,5,B001GCUO5M,"I didn't know what to expect on Shutter Island, the movie's title is sort of off-putting and I thought it was going to be a relitively cheesey pocorn movie.  Then I realize it's directed by Martin Scorsese at the last minute and I enjoy most of his films.  If Shutter Island were directed by anyone else, it potentially could have went into another realm and direction and collapse from within.  I loved Leo Di Caprio in The Aviator and Titanic so he's gained my approval as a decent actor who really commits himself into the roles he's playing.  I was a bit apprehensive when I first heard the east coast accent he devolped for this role and I thought to myself, ""am I going to have to listen to this crap all night?""  But then it seamlessly blends into his character and it just becomes him, which is quite impressive.  There is also something attractive about him that I can't quite put my finger on.  There's this subtle sexual undertone thing going on with him and I don't know if it's because I'm sexually atracted to him or if it's just because he's aging well and looks more handsome now.  This has nothing to do with the movie but it can influence your oppinions about his acting and the film itself.  Actually that's not true because I think Russel Crow is hot but I hate all of his movies, he's a crap actor. Never mind, I'm sorry.  I'm off on a strange tangent.  I enjoyed the intersting story in Shutter Island and it does throw you for a loop at the end when u find out that Leo is actually a patient at the facility.  It's sort of in the same vein as the ending in Nicole Kidman's ""The Others"" (another great movie).  It's very Twilight Zone-ish and creeps you out.  Shutter Island is the first movie I've seen this year that's actually entertained me.  Good movies are hard to find these days, just like men.  I wonder if Leo Di Caprio's single?

3605882,4,B001GCUO5M,"Hard-drinking, migraine-suffering US Marshall Teddy Daniels is called out to Shutter Island when a violent criminal escapes from the mental hospital on the island. Teddy has problems; his memories of WW2 haunt him, as does the death of his wife in an apartment fire. He struggles to keep it together, as he wonders, privately, if he doesn't belong in a mental hospital himself. Teddy and his partner have to sift out the truth from fantasy as they interview the patients. But there is a common theme--the inmates are terrified, and there is a mysterious 67th patient who no one seems to know anything about. As they are drawn deeper into the asylum, toward Cell C, for the most violent patients, Teddy's grasp on reality slips further and further away.

The character of Teddy is excellently played by Leonard DiCaprio; we feel his pain at his wife's death, share his trauma from the war; the dream scenes are particularly bittersweet and heartrending. And we get a glimpse into the horrors that passed as ""medical treatment"" in the 1950's.

Shutter Island will constantly keep you guessing--what is real? What is sanity? How should the mental ill be treated? It is a thought-provoking and emotionally wrenching story that will stay with you for a long time.",1289779200,,1258,4.901408450704225
3605893,4,B001GCUO5M,"Within the last few years I'm amazed at Leonardo DiCaprio's transformation. He's come a long way from playing the annoying little street rat pretty-boy in Titanic to playing leading roles that one could call... manly! I feel this transformation started in Gangs of New York (a film that I don't like) and culminated in Blood Diamond. Since that time he's gone on to do films like The Departed and most recently, the critically claimed Inception.

Perhaps one could say that Shutter Island is more of a psychological thriller rather than a horror film. While I would argue that many of these things are one in the same; I will say that for those who are looking for horror there are plenty of those elements to be found. Leonardo DiCaprio plays U.S Marshal Edward Daniels. He's been sent to investigate the disappearance of a patient at Ashecliff Hospital, a mental facility for the most dangerous and psychotic of the criminally insane. The hospital itself is on a remote island located just outside of Boston. On the fairy ride over, Daniels meets his partner, Chuck Aule. It seems that the patient the Marshal's are looking for has simply vanished into thin air. What's more, things at Ashecliff seem strongly amiss. For example, the doctors and staff are less than willing to cooperate with the investigation. What's worst is that a hurricane is fast approaching, threatening to make Shutter Island even more chaotic.

The description above is indeed bare bones but there are reasons for that. I'll simply say that there are plenty of psychological twists and turns that will keep you on your toes and have you wondering just what in the bloody hell is going on. Few films are able to keep me in the dark these days but Shutter Island truly managed to do just that.

The atmosphere is captured perfectly. When we first arrive on the island, a storm is approaching yet Ashecliff Hospital (at least on the outside) is presented as a peaceful, well-kept facility with its perfect green lawn and tended flowers. Still, we as an audience know that something is awry from the sinister sounds of the musical scores haunting tone. Of course, much of Shutter Island's brilliance can be credited to Martin Scorsese, a man who has directed such classic gems as Goodfellas.

While Shutter Island isn't a perfect film (there are a few scenes I felt dragged on a bit too long) it is in essence one of the most pure horror films you can watch. It plays on many of our fears including mental sanity, darkness and remoteness with the inability to escape. With it's cryptic story, great acting and unforgettable atmosphere, Shutter Island will indeed make you shutter at least once... if not more!

3605894,4,B001GCUO5M,"US Marshal Teddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his partner Chuck Aule (Mark Ruffalo) are sent to Ashecliff Hospital to investigate the disappearance of a patient.  The hospital is a unique institution, the only one of its kind in the world.  It houses the most severe of the criminally insane and is located on an island twelve miles from the nearest shore.

I was expecting a lot from this movie.  Many of the reviews I've read have hailed it as a true horror movie, but after seeing the film I'm not so sure about that assessment.  While there were some suspenseful scenes, I think I only jumped one time, and that was just because the speakers were way too loud.

Perhaps the problem with tagging Shutter Island as a horror movie is that there is no accepted definition for ""horror.""  What may terrify one person might make another laugh.  There are things in the movie that are creepy, macabre, strange, even ghostly, all the elements of a classic horror motif, but I failed to have any real fear.

That's not to say that the movie is bad.  No, in fact, I enjoyed the movie, with reservations.  The meat of the story (though somewhat predictable... I had one character pegged from the moment I first saw him) centers on guilt.  Teddy served during WWII and helped liberate a death camp and he has severe post-war trauma.  His wife died while he was at work and he feels responsible for that.  Teddy is a walking bag of mixed emotions, trying to come to grips with life and accept it.  This, truly, is the main story, but even it was not altogether engrossing.

The best thing about Shutter Island was the island itself.  The set design was beautiful.  The film takes place in 1954, and Scorsese's directorial eye captured this time period gracefully.  The Ashecliff hospital's grounds are beautiful and well manicured.  The buildings are old but attractive.  The costumes are perfect.  Then there's the darker side of the island.  The prison side.  Ward C, an old Civil War-era building that's home to the most violent of the patients, was definitely the creepiest part of the film.  The lighthouse and its mystery.  The caves.

Indeed, watching the film was enjoyable.  I think I went in expecting something grand, and my sights were set to high.  I felt the conclusion was underwhelming, and I was certainly prepared for it.  The film was slow at times, especially Teddy's flashbacks to the War, but there was just enough intrigue to keep me watching.

Overall, I enjoyed Shutter Island, but at the same time I was a little disappointed.  The acting was superb.  The set was beautiful.  The sounds were pleasant.  The plot, however, the main crux of any movie, dropped the ball.  I can recommend seeing the movie, but waiting for a matinee or the DVD release wouldn't be a bad idea.",1288828800,,2790,4.680412371134021
3605895,3,B001GCUO5M,"I had only seen small previews of this movie and had never really paid attention to it or had an interest in seeing it.  However, when it was on the discount rack at the local movie store I decided to give it a try.  Directed by Martin Scorsese it should have been a good movie.  And while it wasn't too bad, I'd rate it a high average compared to some of his other excellent works.

Leonardo DiCaprio plays Teddy Daniels, an FBI agent who has been sent to Shutter Island to investigate the disappearance of one of the inmate/patients there.  You see, Shutter Island is home to the Ashecliff hospital for the criminally insane.  Most of the people sent there never leave and are too dangerous to hold near the general population.  In fact, the woman who disappeared is accused of murdering her three children by drowning them in the lake.  His partner, Chuck Aule (Mark Ruffalo) is along to help him solve the case.  The problem is, things keep going from bad to worse when they start suspecting that no one wants this case solved after all.  Not a single person is being helpful and Daniels starts to suspect that the head psychiatrist (Ben Kingsley) is out to make sure he never leaves the island and expose their deadly secret.

There is a lighthouse on the island and this is where Daniels thinks they are doing horrific experiments.  The head psychiatrist Dr. Cawley claims they only use medicine and therapy, but Daniels believes they are doing lobotomies in this horrible place as well.  He is determined to get to the bottom of it even though when the missing woman is found there is no reason for him to stay on the island.  However, strange things keep happening to Daniels (his dead wife keeps haunting his dreams) and he can only hope he won't fall into the madness that is Shutter Island.

DiCaprio does a good job in this movie.  He's believable and while he does come on as an incompetent character sometimes (only because he couldn't hear me screaming at him to get out of there!) he plays a pretty deep complex character and does fair job of getting the nuances just right. As a whole I'm not a big fan of DiCaprio as I think its too easy to remember his previous films when he's acting and that can be mildly distracting. His partner doesn't have much of a part aside from a few side things so I didn't really feel I had enough background to critique his part in the movie.  Kingsley is always fantastic and it was great that he easily made the watcher suspicious of him from the get go.

There was quite a bit of music in this movie and it does have an impressive score.  That said, it wasn't my type of music and therefore wasn't very memorable for me.  The genre of the music was mainly classical.

An interesting premise. but it can be quite predictable at time.  Because of this I really didn't feel surprise at the end and some of the scenes in the movie could get quite boring as they were trying to build story without anything happening.  Definitely three stars, it wasn't bad but it wasn't excellent either.  I did enjoy the locale of the movie as well, it was hauntingly beautiful.

3605896,4,B001GCUO5M,"I'd heard a lot of hype about the big twist in Shutter Island. However, I never heard what it was. We finally rented the DVD and watched it last night.

The movie is creepy enough to be a good semi-horror thriller. The island and sanitarium just reek of atmosphere. Scenes are played out in a meticulously creepy manner. However, about ten minutes into the movie we figured out what the twist was.
Maybe that type of thing has been done just too many times, I don't know.

Aside from that, for an easy-to-figure-out plot twist, this was a well-done movie. I enjoyed the buildup even if the ending was what I expected. The only scene I didn't like, which unfortunately, was a big key to the plot, was the family scene, the real motivation behind this whole thing.

I'll admit that I was left guessing as to who the real bad guys were until the end, just in case my assumption was wrong. I enjoyed not being sure.

Great actors, creepy scenery, well-built story. I only give it four stars instead of five because of the lack of surprise at the ending and the disturbing family scene. I'm sure others have given plenty of spoilers with so many reviews already on here, but I'm not going to add to it. Recommended.",1288310400,,1210,4.461538461538462
3605897,4,B001GCUO5M,"My favorite part of this book was the ending! This book has an ending that will shock you but at the same time make you wonder why you didn't see it yourself. The ending is freaky and I loved it!

This book is about a U.S. Marshal that is sent to Ashecliffe Hospital for the Criminally Insane on Shutter Island in Maine to look for a missing patient. He has to crack all these different codes while looking for the patient. The thing is though is that somehow his life with his wife (now dead) is somehow involved in the missing patient, Ashcliffe, Shutter Island and more...

This book kept me guessing...and as soon as I thought I had it all figured out it threw me a curve ball. I couldn't put this one down! During the middle of the book I got a little restless with it just because it was a little confusing and a little crazy, but it picked back up soon enough! This was a great scary story read for Halloween...now I can't wait to see the movie!",1288051200,,952,4.225274725274725
3605898,3,B001GCUO5M,"Inception was a mind bender of a movie and people loved it but I fail to understand that the same people have ignored a similar themed Shutter Island. Based on Dennis Lehane's book Shutter Island is the story of two U.S. Marshalls, who go to Shutter Island to investigate the disappearance of a patients Rachel Solando who has disappeared from a mental asylum on that island.  The duo set out to investigate the mysterious happenings and confront a shocking ending.
I thought the movie was excellent in all respects and a great adaptation of a fine book. It is hard to adapt great books but the movie does just that. The direction was first rate which was expected of a director like Martin Scorcese. Leonardo Caprio delivers a fine performance and I think is on his way to become one of the finest actors of his generation. The end of the movie was haunting and the viewer has to watch the movie carefully or twice to understand the twister. If you cannot, I suggest watch the making of instead.

3605899,5,B001GCUO5M,"""All Those Who Enter Here""...OK...Shutter Island is NOT Hell, but what is Hell anyway? Our hero, Leo C. sets out on a quest for the truth about a disappearance at a mental institution on Shutter Island. Will he uncover the truth, and what is the truth anyway?

I will let others go into a synopsis of this movie. What I will tell you is that even if you have been given the entire plot...watch it anyway! I am one of those annoying people who almost always gets it 5 minutes into the plot, and I did with this movie. However, watching the acting, the interplay of characters...each little gesture of hand and eye...each struggle, internal and external, to dredge away the lies and reveal the truth is exquisitely portrayed!

For all its complexity and ""other-worldy"" atmosphere, Shutter Island is filmed with scrutiny, careful attention to detail and a love of the genre. The acting...excellent...LOVE Leo now that he has matured into a finely-honed actor. Mark Ruffalo is perfect in his role as the trusted sidekick. Ben Kingsley...well, as always a total joy! The storyline is inventive and well planned...executed to perfection!

I am a tough critic....loved this movie....will watch it over and over and each time I am sure I will get more out of it! Movies that make me think, surprise me when they can, make me delve into my own inner depths...that's what I call entertainment!!!!!",1287619200,,1387,4.819327731092437

But if you like to be kept guessing and don't mind getting inside the mind of the character and enjoy psychological suspense and good crime films then you have got to see this one.

3605901,5,B001GCUO5M,"This really is a return to form in many ways, for Scorcese the film-maker.  We're in Cape Fear territory here, inasmuch as our Martin clearly wants to show off his directorial skills, and his movie knowledge.  This is not a case of the director being invisible to the process to serve the story - here he is key in using all sorts of tricks and magic to entertain and surprise, visually, aurally and narratively.  Movie referencing is rife (look for the scene running up the stairs in the lighthouse, then go watch Vertigo again), and the nature of the story itself lends itself to some startling imagery.
So what's it about?  Well, the less said going in to the movie the better.. suffice to say, that DiCaprio (on blistering form) and his colleague (Mark Ruffalo - understated yet also excellent in the role) arrive in 1954 on the eponymous island as two Marshalls, sent to investigate reports of a missing person.  The island is a sanatorium for the criminally insane, lending a creepy and unsettling atmosphere from the first moment it appears through the mists.  They meet the doctors, Ben Kingsley and Max von Sydow in their wonderfully Gothic setting, crackling fireplace and thundery soundtrack from the brewing storm.  However, as time goes by, DiCaprio feels his grip on reality loosening.  Is there a conspiracy on the island?  Is his past trauma in the war catching up with him?  Why do the facts signally fail to add up?  It's a great build - and even, if some have said, the plot is somewhat easy to guess at early on, the machinations to get there never fail to be interesting at the least, and mesmerising if like me you really get into the atmosphere of the movie.
Much credit to maintaining the atmosphere goes to the cinematography which is simply magnificent, lending an eerie, sepia toned hue to the period setting, and yet some startling colour imagery in the dream scenes.  The soundtrack too should get an honourable mention, using  modern classical music to create the off kilter feel, rather than one sound from one composer to unite the tone.  You really get the feeling that Marty was enjoying himself to bits making this - if giving him an Oscar encourages him to have this much fun without the weight of expectation, for goodness sake give him another one.
Bluray serves this movie very well - the clarity of those sounds, the storm, even the aforementioned crackle of the fireplace, all feel exactly where they should be, and the images are so vivid and startling in high definition it's worth going blu on this one.  If I didn't have a BR player already, this may well be the one that would tempt me to get one.
In a nutshell, this is utterly brilliant - at the same time revelling in the love of cinema of old, while adding his own distinctive Scorcese touch, topped with a performance from DiCaprio which roots you in the drama, this is one for those who love pure cinema.  It's eminently watchable, and as the best movies are, eminently rewatchable too.  Recommended.",1287187200,,3002,4.67680608365019

Not content to rest on his laurels after wresting the elusive Oscar (if he ever pursued it in the first place) Scorsese pushes and challenges himself and creates a work unlike anything in his canon.  Though the influence of Kubrick and Hitchcock are apparent ""Shutter Island"" is unique and original and totally Marty.  I could also see the influence of Shyamalan before he fell out of favor.  It would behoove Shyamalan to view this film so he can get his career back on track.  ""Shutter Island"" is a complex film that demands close attention sort of like a jigsaw puzzle where the true picture isn't apparent until all the interlocking pieces are connected.

As I watched this movie, it seemed really interesting, with tension created from the first moments and continuing throughout.  But as I started to reach the end, it seemed that the plot was reaching a conclusion which made the whole movie rather pointless, if not depressing.

Then the ending of the movie turned me upside down and gave me a serious case of vertigo.  I was being told that most of what I had come to believe and become attached to during the movie was flat out wrong.  In fact, the shock to my beliefs regarding the characters and plot was so profound that I had to watch the bonus materials on the DVD to finally believe and accept what I was now being told.  Never before have I had an experience like this with a movie, and the movie is thus uniquely brilliant and certainly worth watching more than once.

The general lesson which is illustrated with tremendous power is that, even among those of us who actively try to be objective and critical thinkers guided by evidence, we're still very prone to developing false beliefs and then bending over backwards to resist evidence which contradicts those beliefs.

3605929,2,B001GCUO5M,"SHUTTER ISLAND, the Martin Scorsese film starring Leonardo DiCaprio, is one picture I really wanted to like but didn't. I just couldn't.  SHUTTER ISLAND is slow, pretentious, stilted, and clich&eacute;. The ending is worthy of M. Night Shamylan on a very bad day (which is saying a lot considering his many failures.) But maybe I'm getting ahead of myself. Let me start at the beginning.

Leonardo DiCaprio plays a US Marshall who is headed to SHUTTER ISLAND to find out what happened to an escaped mental patient. There he meets Ben Kingsley and Max von Sydow who are the scientists in charge of the place. After several CGI flashbacks, we learn that DiCaprio's character was a witness to the infamous ""Dachau Massacre."" You'll realize, after the movie is over, that this has no bearing whatsoever on the movie, despite a good amount of time being spent on it. (The film's account of the incident also seems to be at odds with the contemporary history.) We also learn, through flashback and clumsy exposition, that he is on SHUTTER ISLAND for a very personal reason - to find the man that killed his wife, whom he still sees in visions. So we have maximum security mental hospital on a secluded island with only one way off. Did I mention they are in the middle of a hurricane? And all their electricity goes out? And the crazies escape? And there's a horde of rats? And... And none of that even matters to the movie, but it's all in there. There are secret messages, warnings, crazies who seem sane, the obligatory shock therapy and frontal lobotomies, and an ending that for the life of me I believe was tacked on at the last minute just because. It's as though they took elements from several movies and soldered them together. It just doesn't work.

All-in-all, I cannot recommend SHUTTER ISLAND.  There are many better movies for each of the genres that this film tries to represent. Here's a sample:

-  Mental Health: One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest
-  1950's Crime Drama: L.A. Confidential
-  Stuck on an Island: And Then There Were None
-  I See Dead People: Sixth Sense
-  Escaping from a Prison on an Island: Escape From Alcatraz

I began by disliking Leonardo Di Caprio's character, but the actor, who turns in a performance that is both creditable and ultimately moving, won me over by the end of the film. Ben Kingsley and Max von Sydow lend their usual touch of class to the proceedings.

The Blu-Ray format shows off the splendid cinematography, which ranges from almost impenetrable darkness to over-saturated hallucinatory colours. Hurricane-force winds and rains emphasize isolation and discomfort, both in the protagonist and the viewer, and images of chains and patterns of cages contribute an intense claustrophobia.

Out of all the Scorsese films I've seen in the past decade or so (let's say, from Gangs of New York and up), I have to say Shutter Island is certainly the most surprising. Like a lot of people do, I'm sure the mere mention of the director's name is, more often than not, associated with gangster movies or gritty character dramas. But here, he delves into something new - a psychological thriller. Shutter Island follows U.S. Marshall Teddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio) to the aforementioned facility for the criminally insane, in which he's been asked to help find an escaped patient. During his investigation, he stumbles upon revelations and discoveries that lead to even more mysteries as he starts to question the true intentions of Dr. Cawley (Sir Ben Kingsley), the rest of the staff, and even his own partner (Mark Ruffalo). But with dreams and broken pieces of his past beginning to haunt him, paranoia, distrust, and denial are bound to distract his attention and twist his beliefs. Without spoiling the plot, Shutter Island is an excellent film set in the 1950s with an old-school detective feel to it that manages, not only to intrigue, but also present a good deal of empathy for the characters (something Scorsese excels at). In addition, it also manages to put something into perspective that I've never quite appreciated, and that's the acting ability of one Leonardo DiCaprio. I didn't particularly care for any of his roles in the '90s outside of The Quick and the Dead, but ever since seeing him in this, I've been playing catchup from Gangs of New York till now, and I have to say he's certainly developed into a fine actor with a lot of screen presence and charisma. Equally supportive of his work in the film, though, are some stellar supporting performances by Sir Kingsley, Ruffalo, and what little parts there are for Max von Sydow and Jackie Earle Haley. Shutter Island is a great psychological mystery/thriller that managed to keep me suspended from beginning to end and also has a good deal of replay value as well. You'll know what I mean when you see it.

Video - 5.0

By far the best quality of this video presentation is the colors. I was amazed at how vibrant the different shades of primaries were from scene to scene and in-between reality and Teddy's memories/dreams. From the cold and murky flashbacks of his days during the war and the snow-covered fields that covered the dozens of corpses in his path to the bright yellows and oranges of his wife's dress and their apartment, Robert Richardson's eye-popping photography makes for an equally tripped-out vision of the many layers residing in the film's visual progression. Black levels and contrast are perfect, giving the movie that dark and gritty Scorsese feel, but also complimenting the atmospherics. The fine lines in clothing, the blades of grass and lush tree leaves in the courtyard, and all the little cracks and crevices within the island's surrounding rocks and cliffs look astonishing. This is by far the prettiest gritty picture I've seen from Scorsese yet and is something I'm very pleased with. One of my favorite shots is the scene where Teddy and Chuck (Ruffalo) are standing on the cliff with the deputy warden looking down at the water. I'm not sure whether or not the clouds and background behind them were green screened, but something about that shot just feels dark, spooky, and ominous and very befitting for the kind of movie this is. The picture is pristine and free of any artifacts or debris and shows no signs of any kind of manipulation whatsoever. Here's hoping to the same kind of quality for Scorsese's future projects.

Audio - 5.0

Complimenting the reference video is an equally reference audio track. While it's certainly lacking overall LFEs, I have to say I absolutely love what it does for general atmospherics and ambiance, regardless. Robbie Robertson's music supervision and use of pre-recorded compositions from various sources does a splendid job from the very beginning with the foghorn piece to string, brass, and other classical pieces played throughout. Dialogue is especially crisp with its varying amounts of indoor-voice, whisper, and scream volumes and never becomes muddled or lost in the music. Directionality of sound effects disperse themselves from the fronts and rears adding that extra sense of calm and craziness when need be in the form of screaming patients, storm noises outside the facility, metal doors slamming shut, waves washing ashore, birds chirping during the daytime, wind howling at night, the crackling of a fireplace in Dr. Cawley's study, and the dripping of water droplets within the silent tension of Ward C. Separation of said effects, music, and dialogue never bog one another down and really help to showcase the wonders of, yet, another commendable lossless track. While this probably won't hold up to the sound designs of modern day blockbusters, it was perfect enough for me and works very well with the subject matter of the plot.

Extras - 3.0

Shutter Island only comes with a mere 38 minutes of behind-the-scenes interviews from the cast, crew, author of the novel, and a mental health consultant. In the first vignette they explain bits and pieces of how the film came to fruition from book to movie, what Scorsese wanted to do with it, and a little bit of the actual filming process like set design and music. The second feature focuses more on the medical perspective and history of mental health from back in those days and talks about the transition that was occurring at the time, how the practice evolved between then and now, and the accuracy of how it's depicted within the film itself. While an audio commentary or a more in-depth look at how the movie was made would've been nice, the extras still provide a good deal of information about the story's themes and really helped me, personally, understand the kind of perseverance and dedication it takes to be a mental health professional. But given how fascinated I've recently become with Scorsese and his approach to film-making, I really wish Paramount had gone all out with a whole second disc of extras and one or two commentaries, at least. As much as I hate to double-dip, I actually wouldn't mind doing it for this, pending on what they might add.

Overall - 4.5

I took the film to be something more along the lines of a conspiracy thriller when I first saw the trailer, which it is in some fashion. But the big twist at the end really threw me in a loop and caught me by surprise. Some people may find this too ""different"" from the norm of Scorsese, but I found it quite refreshing and very entertaining at the same time. Shutter Island is certainly a mystery, but also a finely-crafted thriller that will more than likely have you duped the first time around. Thankfully, it has a lot of replay value and should make more sense a second or third time through.

I remember someone once telling me about a similar situation, that these types of mental illness render the sufferer unable to create a cohesive explanation of their life story, and this is masterfully depicted here. For those who have lived with this kind of illness, the film will be fascinating, wonderful, deeply moving and, given its intelligence, its closing question will leave you troubled. Few films have challenged me to this degree (one thinks of Eyes Wide Shut, for example).

Leonardo DiCaprio is brilliant in the lead role of this film.  It is easily his best performance since 'The Aviator' in 2004.  His performance is one of the most down to earth, believable ones in recent memory.  When he emotes he doesn't downplay or exaggerate for the sake of the film.  He reacts in ways I could easily imagine a real person.  DiCaprio may not have starred in a movie nearly as successful as 'Titanic', but as far as acting is concerned he is 10x the actor he was in 1997.

Scorsese is a genius.  That goes without saying it.  Martin Scorsese ranks up with the likes of Stanley Kubrick, Alfred Hitchcock, and Orson Welles as far as influence of cinematic techniques is concerned.  Some were disappointed by Shutter Island, saying that it doesn't live up to Scorsese's reputation.  I don't think there is anything wrong with the directing in this film.

The decision of composer and Scorsese-collaborator Robbie Robertson and Scorsese to use only classical music for the film is very Stanley Kubrick, but it also works very well in Shutter Island.  Every piece of music manages to capture the scenes.  It is a marvel how they make these pieces almost seem as if they were written for the film.

Make sure to give 'Shutter Island' two viewings, and don't let the first viewing define your view of the film.  You will learn most from the film after two viewings spread out over a period of time.  After seeing this movie for the second time, having thought over the first viewing for a period of six months, the film took on a new dimension of greatness.  Somethings become more clear, while others remain a mystery.

Don't write this film off after one viewing.  If you do, you're missing out on the power of Scorsese's fresh masterpiece.",1282262400,,2322,4.6905940594059405

3605967,4,B001GCUO5M,"Martin Scorcese's 'Shutter Island' may not be as praised or praiseworthy as his recent film 'The Departed,' but it is nonetheless a successfully tense viewing experience. Leonardo DiCaprio is, as expected (lately), powerful, almost overwhelming, as the tumultuous marshal Teddy Daniels. He has been sent to investigate the disappearance of a woman on an island off Massachusetts that consists solely of a prison for the criminally insane. On the ride over, he meets his new partner Chuck (Mark Ruffalo), and at the institute, he encounters a variety of cryptic doctors and disturbed patients.

Dr. Cawley (Ben Kingsley) appears to be a forward thinking psychiatrist, while the German Dr. Naehring (Max von Sydow) espouses harsher beliefs about the mad. Between unfruitful interviews, Teddy dreams of his dead wife Dolores (Michelle Williams) and recalls the liberation of the Dachau concentration camp, of which the fenced in island is eerily reminiscent. Kingsley and von Sydow are reliably subtle. Emily Mortimer and Patricia Clarkson are likewise excellent in very different roles.

Progressively surreal circumstances make both Teddy and the audience increasingly uncomfortable. The surprisingly straightforward ending has been criticized as cheap and predictable. However, it has enough substance to make the viewer consider seeing the film twice.

Problems include one too many smiles by crazy folks. Instead of creepy, they come across as cliche. Also, though visually astounding, flashbacks and dream sequences lack intriguing dialogue. Per usual in adaptations of Dennis Lehane novels (Gone Baby Gone and Mystic River), the love interest is more a foil to the male protagonist than a fully developed character.

The movie's slow pace resembles the similarly scored Stanley Kubrick classic 'The Shining.' Though 'Shutter Island' doesn't reach those heights, it is good in its own right, especially towards the middle of the piece, when viewers don't know what to think or hold on to.",1282003200,,1991,5.496732026143791

This movie is the complete opposite of the movie Coma, made back in 1978.

And yes, this movie is disturbing, just like the movie Coma.  In a way, it is what the sales agent would tell you, ""they are doing the sales, caring for you and for your own good.  If you think they have other plans, you are thinking too much.""  Oh well, these days, I find it closer to the version of that instead of the version in the movie Shutter Island.

Yes, and in fact you do need the rust proof under your car for $2500, and $800 for the stain proof for your seats.  And they sell you the extended warranty really to hope you have the best product experience, that's why they are pushing it so hard.

It is like other popular events these days too: they give you a bowl of something that tastes good -- it is not real taste -- it is MSG.  They give you something that taste sweet.  It is not sugar, it is High Fructose Corn Syrup, something that the body cannot register as food.  They tell you to recycle the paper, and at the same time they use all those recycled paper at a lower cost to send you all the junk mails they want to.  More and more, I can't tell the meat is really chicken or pork.

3605971,4,B001GCUO5M,"I love this film.  I did not read the book on which it was based so I can't comment on its transfer to film but I can say that as an atmospheric, edge of your seat thriller this film is superb.  It is not perfect by any means.  The first time I watched it I was enthralled till the ending which sort of left me perplexed and made me unsure of the whole experience.  But this film is one where when they say it must be viewed twice they mean it.  Knowing the ending actually made a repeat viewing even better than the first.  I must note that after the first viewing I did enjoy it enough to purchase it.  I have now viewed it three times.  Of course we have two masters here - Martin Scorsese and Leonardo DiCaprio.  In less talented hands than Scorsese this film could have turned into a regular B horror film.  But Scorsese treats the slightly flawed script with respect and the directing, music, photography, editing and most of all acting make this a grade A film all the way.  Leonardo DiCaprio is now proving film after film just what a skilled actor he is.  For me this was the best performance of his career and shows him to be one of the best actors of this deacade.  And perfect performances are elicited from Mark Ruffalo and Ben Kingsley as well.  Actually this film was made with such precise decisions that even all the supporting roles down to the smallest ones are pitch perfect.  Of most note are Michelle Williams and Patricia Clarkson.

The film begins with Leonardo DiCaprio as U.S. Marshal Teddy Daniels going with his new partner played by Ruffalo to Shutter Island which is an asylum for the criminally insane to investigate the disappearance of a female inmate.  But no one is actually as they seem and truths about the island start to appear to Teddy and he realizes that things are sinister and there are many secrets here.  Then we get twists and turns galore that build to a very dramatic ending.  This is a film that must be viewed for it is cinema at its best.  We have the master director Scorsese turning an ok script into a suspense masterpiece.  From the beginning boat ride with the spooky atmospheric music you can sit back knowing you are going to have a super suspenseful ride.  Let the grade A directing and flawless acting bring you to another world.  I can't give this film 5 stars for the script is slightly flawed but I will view it over and over for the superb piece of film making it is.  And it makes a brilliant showing on blu ray.  The picture is very crisp and clarity superb.  Colors are brilliant and the whole experience will make you feel as if you are there.

Some of the flashbacks were overdone and could have shortened (perhaps less graphic).

If your looking for a movie to unwind after a hard days work and can't find anything on the 300 channels of cable like me. This movie won't disappoint. If you liked movies like ""The secret Window"",""Fraility"",or ""stir of Echos"" than this movie is for you. If you hated these movies stay away. You probably will not like this movie either.

Also Edward is trying to find a patient who supposedly set his house on fire and killed his wife!
  Overall, if I could give this movie 4.5 stars I would, but since it's not quite a five star movie I'm going to have to give it a 4 star rating.

This work shares something with Mulholland Drive and A Beautiful Mind in that it shows us the alternate version of reality before we (seemingly) see the consensual one.  I find this to be the only really revelatory way to explore the realm of insanity.  The fact that we are not even sure at the end about what the external reality actually is makes the film even more thought-provoking.  Those looking for something more straighforward and conventional already have plenty of that sort of movies to choose from.  Thank you, Mr. Scorsese, for this wonderfully meditative masterpiece.

Watching this movie has left me not only scarred by the realization of the climax, and ending, but HIGHLY impressed at how Leonardo has matured in his acting. Scorsese has AGAIN created a masterpiece that will not only leave you breathless, emotionally scarred, amazed, and distrought by the plight of every aspect of the protagonists life.(partial spoiler!!!!)

It started out promising, but soon fell to mediocre  after the first 35 min or so.  I kept watching because I already bought the movie, and because the shinning reviews promised there would be something redeeming in the story line.  It was not to be.  If you just like to look at Leonardo and don't care about the story, then by all means get the movie.

3605991,1,B001GCUO5M,"I'm not sure why I'm bothering to review this movie. but I just saw it and I thought it was so awful I had to express my disgust. Basically what we have here is a movie that throws in everything but the kitchen sink (Nazi death camps, Cold War brainwashing, mind-altering drugs, hallucinations, dreams, evil doctors, a government investigator held captive and trying to escape, an assortment of lunatics, etc.) and then tries to redeem itself with a dreary twist that deconstructs everything that preceded it. Is that really worth two hours of anybody's life? To boot, the ""twist"" is totally unfair as the only ""hints"" earlier in the movie are an anagram (which goes back at least to ""Rosemary's Baby"") and a reinterpreation of an obscure line of dialogue (which goes back to ""The Conversation,"" where at least the line is repeated several times). This one is what you might call an unfair mystery, since we actually see one movie and then find out what we saw wasn't real (like one of those old movies where everything turns out to be a dream). The problem is compounded by an overwhelming and corny musical score and some truly dreadful ""acting"" by Leonardo diCaprio, whose technique consists of knitting his brows, looking serious, and affecting a hopelessly hokey ""New England accent"" (""I'm a cawp, a mahshal""). When he 'emotes' he also manages to look really stupid. How on earth did this guy become a star?  He can't act his way out of a paper bag. As for Max von Sydow and Ben Kingsley, they seem to be doing self-parody here. They need a new act. The film is loaded with idiotic lines like, ""He's here. Laeddis. I can feel him!"" By the way, the name is spelled this way because it's part of the immortal anagram. (Gimme a break!) The rest of the actors seem to be having a hard time keeping a straight face through the absurdities they are forced to utter. Some viewers seem to think this movie is about personal identity or something. It's not. It's about a poor screenwriter and a frankly over-the-hill director playing silly mind games with their audience.",1280275200,23,2067,4.678571428571429
3605992,4,B001GCUO5M,"Shutter Island is not a film I expected to like. A psychological thriller with touches of horror and jump scares? Boring. And it would be too in the hands of literally anybody else. Instead, we have Scorsese making moods like it's nobody's business & creating atmosphere while still balancing those pesky things called plots and characters. Leo makes good use of the accent and brings some humanity to an otherwise messed up man.

Granted, one could only come to this conclusion after the end of the movie since the movie lives or dies by its 3rd act. Personally, I think they did a great job with it. It's unrealistic as all get out, but Scorsese sells you on it, and rest assured if you go back through the movie, it still mostly holds up with the twist. But here's the thing, without the twist, it would be a fairly generic and boring film, even if everything else was the same. The ending and the reveals/twists bring a quiet intensity to the proceedings which lead to some good emotional and dramatic moments, and somehow makes the rest of the film worth it.

Overall, if you like a good Scorsese mood piece, then by all means watch this movie. It's not a brilliant movie, and we could debate the warrant of that ending all day long, but in the end, Shutter Island is pretty entertaining.",1280275200,,1293,4.545064377682404

3606014,4,B001GCUO5M,"While I need to watch this movie a second time before I can say if I buy into it completely, I can say it is effective. Scorsese does a wonderful job of getting you wrapped up in the world of Shutter Island, an asylum/prison where the criminally insane are treated. The music, set design, and cinematography do an excellent job of providing a creepy, discomforting atmosphere.

Leonardo DiCaprio plays Teddy Daniels, a U.S. Marshal called to Shutter Island with his new partner Chuck Aule (Mark Ruffalo) to investigate the disappearance of Rachel, a patient there because she drowned her 3 children. Dr. Cawley (Ben Kingsley), one of those in charge on the island, treats the people there as patients who could be rehabilitated if treated with respect; in contrast, Teddy sees them more like criminals, the same way the prison guards and Warden on the Island view them. Likewise, other doctors believe the patients must be controlled either via lobotomies or drugs.

Cawley and others appear less than cooperative with Teddy in his investigation, although he is allowed to interview the staff and patients. Nothing about the disappearance makes sense - Rachel left behind her shoes, nobody saw her leave, and there's been no evidence aside from a strange note Teddy finds in her room. Eventually Teddy confides in Chuck, telling him why he took the case - the man who started the house fire which killed Teddy's wife and kids was a patient there but has since disappeared. Teddy spoke with Noyce, a former patient from the Island, and got the idea that strange experiments might be occurring on the Island. Having served in World War II and helped free a concentration camp, Teddy was aware of the horrors people are capable of and continued to have disturbing visions and dreams. His dreams also feature his wife Dolores (Michelle Williams) in various settings such as their burning house. These visions and dreams also seem to provide clues for the investigation. When Rachel suddenly reappears safe and sound, Teddy still continues his investigation into the island and the whereabouts of his wife's killer.

A hurricane crops up while Teddy and Chuck are on the Island, providing for an even moodier atmosphere and more tense moments. The structure of the Island with its isolation and rocky cliffs add to the feeling of being trapped. The acting is great, the dialog fits perfectly, and Scorsese's directing makes you feel like you're there. All of this is important for the twist ending. The movie as a whole left me feeling disturbed and needing to see it again to clarify some things.",1280275200,2,2592,4.9132420091324205
3606015,5,B001GCUO5M,"I'm sure there will be comparisons made between the two films now that Inception is out. IMO, the latter is superior, but this one is just as cerebrally challenging. I think I took the view that what we see we see through the character's eyes, eyes trained to investigate all the facts of the case. Everyone plays along with him. They know he is good at his job and must tread carefully so as not to spook him. He has come to the island to investigate a case. In so doing, he interviews everyone and that information is what we get until the end of the film when we realize all the clues have been laid out all along. The flashbacks to Dachau are critical. Today we would call it PTS syndrome. He hallucinates; at an early point, we begin to see the confusion in his observations and to question his own circuitous logic. But I don't think anybody would have guessed what is revealed at the end.

When Dicaprio & Ruffalo's characters first get to Shutter Island- the music was a little much. There was a crescendo as if something terrible was about to happen as they approached the gates- then...nothing. I thought I had the story figured out within the first 30 minutes and literally had my finger on the stop button. Blood was displayed as a bright tomato paste, which annoyed me, but later made sense. I figured I had made it so far into the movie I should go ahead and finish; I could at least make fun of it. I am glad that I finished.

Spoiler alert, there are a lot of things Dicaprio does in the film that are questionable considering he is a detective. He is left alone in a dark stairwell to fight a half-naked crazy, he climbs up and down a 100 foot cliff, he trusts his partner who is obviously in on the plot, etc. There are a number of situations that most people would have questioned but he just accepted.

The story is set in ""Boston Harbor Islands 1954"". A ship sails in the fog. A passenger is seasick. They both smoke. [No FDA warnings?] The island is a prison for the criminally insane. There was a fort from the Civil War time, now used for the most dangerous prisoners. The two Federal Marshals are there to search for a fugitive. Dr. Cauley made this a unique institution. Rachel Salender escaped last night. She is a war widow who murdered her three children but believes they are still alive. How did she escape from a locked room?

Teddy Daniels has dreams of the past (a nightmare?). Should patients get lobotomies [never proven to work] or doses of thorazine to make them tranquil?

Patients are interviewed. [Is this believable?] Is this for comedy or satire? What kind of glass does Mrs. Kearns drink from? We learn why Teddy Daniels chose this case. Where did Andrew Laytes disappear to? The storm blows down trees. Daniels recalls his past in the war at Dachau. [Were those guards really shot after they surrendered?] Daniels tells about George Noyce and how he was put in Ashcliff. Can he be believed?

[The film begins to drag again.] A scream starts a new dream. ""See!"" Teddy dreams of his wife again. Then they visit Ward C, the oldest and most dangerous ward.

Andrew pops up for a dramatic surprise. There is a fight. A guard shows up. Teddy wanders off, and finds George Noyce. ""They knew."" [The film starts to drag again.] Is the story credible? What is happening on this island? Teddy wants to see the lighthouse. [Wouldn't a lighthouse be located on the top of that island? Would Teddy climb down those slippery rocks? The real Rachel Salender is hiding in a cave. [Food and water?] She asked about sodium amytal shipments and lobotomies. Could patients be brainwashed into automatons? ""Any funny dreams or trouble sleeping?"" [Is this the message of this movie?] ""You'll never leave here"" says Rachel. The guard says ""God loves violence"". Teddy was wandering.

Dr. Cauley tells Teddy he had no partner. A doctor meets Teddy. ""Don't go, Teddy."" Hallucinations? [Swimming in ice cold water?] Guards with rifles? Teddy climbs the stairs to the top of the lighthouse. Chloropromazine for the past 24 months? [Can you believe the ending? Isn't it too incredible?] ""We're telling you the truth."" There is another flashback to years earlier that explains it all. Or does it? [Unbelievable?] Just when you think this film can't get any worse a shot is fired. Then we are back to the present to hear the confession. ""We're too smart for them."" So Teddy goes for a walk.

Perhaps Leonardo with his superior acting range tipped the balance, but whatever changed my initial impulse to avoid the film, I now have to add my voice by stating without any hesitation that this is a truly remarkable experience and a film well deserving of an award. In fact, I consider it one of Scorsese's very best.

However, I am inclined to agree with one reviewer that Kingsley, Ruffalo and some of the other actors may have been miscast, but it doesn't really matter as the film finally belongs to the director and Mr Di Caprio who continue to astound us with their undeniable ability.

3606049,5,B001GCUO5M,"Martin Scorsese delivers one of the best brain-twisters in film history using old movie techniques like a great story, excellent acting and one heck of a ride. Hitchcock would be proud to tell Martin, ""You nailed it."" DiCaprio is allowed to be outstanding even in the presence of the greatness of Max Von Sydow and Ben Kingsley as Scorsese effortlessly crafts a thriller with some many dimensions it is breathtaking. Still, Sydow and Kingsley add a dimension of surreality.

Shutter Island is surreal. Leo and Mark Ruffalo (nice work as his sidekick) are Federal Marshalls looking for an escaped mental patient. Ruffalo's downplay of his part again allowed DiCaprio's character to dominate while not dominating. Tough thing to do. Scorsese does it like Hitchcock did. The weirdness blends into the dark island but familiar uses of familiar sets adorns the film like a tight glove.

Is it psychological or mystical? Is it real or not? Who is sane and insane? It ain't Tommy Lee Jones looking for the Fugitive. The Departed (also Martin's creation) was excellent and sucked you in but Shutter Island never lets you leave. After the movie ends, you'll still be on Shutter Island for awhile. The movie opens and closes. Doors slam and open. The ferryman, Scorsese, isn't about to let you leave till you look deep inside yourself. Now, that's why Shutter Island is his finest work to date.

If you love special effects, it ain't here. If you like action, it ain't Iron Man 2 but far more exciting. Shutter Island is like a painting in reverse or a beautiful flower unfolding and withering. Shutter Island, like many like it, is why we have movie screens. Other than Ordinary People, it is the only perfect film. No gimmicks just a story worthy of telling many times over.",1279497600,9,1766,4.821782178217822

3606076,2,B001GCUO5M,"Shutter Island (2009) with Leonardo DiCaprio was a tremendous dissapointment to me. For its nice cinematic and fine camera work I rate it at 4 stars, very good acting 5 stars, and basic story only 2 stars.  I guess it was because of the many TV spots and DVD commercials promoting this film and the fact that it starred Leonardo DiCaprio that I was especially dissapointed, as I expected something much better.  This movie substituted mental illness for a good mystery, as have so many films going back to the late 50's, but especially since the mid 90's which have all made mental illness a fairly common theme or sub-theme. I did not like or enjoy this plot and I actually felt cheated when everything was explained, once again, by a simple case of insanity. It is just not fair to build up what the viewer believes to be true and then switch all the ground rules. I guess I should have rented it before buying it.

I love surprise endings which are earned by the story, as in Vertigo, Sixth Sense, and Unbreakable, but this film just cheated.",1278806400,4,1045,4.518518518518518
3606077,5,B001GCUO5M,"This movie was about a federal officer who goes to an island to investigate a missing fugitive. The island has a supernatural feel to it, that gives off a creepy vibe. The staff are very odd when it comes time to answer questions. The missing girl is a criminal patient in a prison mental health facility. The explanation on how the girl went missing was again unexplainable and mysterious. Leo who is the key character and lead officer feels frustrated because he is not getting answers and is starting to pitch out signs of anxiety. He is thinking he will write up his reports and leave due to the staff and head adminstrator's lack of cooperation. He has eerie flashbacks before leaving which prompt him to stay and give us a clue to his character. He is holding onto a painful memory that haunts him. This memory is also including dreamlike episodes with his deceased wife, who helps him to gain access to solving particular problems or guiding him in his life journey. Her image is also suspense building and dark. The story leads to the runaway being found. She is living in a world of her own and cannot grasp the reality of her circumstances. She has killed her children and been on the island to serve out her time while being treated. She meets up with Leo's character and sees him as her dead husband. Until she shifts abruptly and realizes he is not what she thought. Here the story starts to become quite interesting. It is hard to go into and there are a few twists which are quite arresting and thought provoking. The plot takes on a whole new avenue of development. Is Leo actually a patient who is suffering from a delusion. A delusion is a fixed fact that cannot be broken or is he being turned into this because he has stumbled onto some possible damning evidence that could hurt others. This is where I think the viewer has to decide. It could be easy and he could just be a patient not wanting to face his actions and living out his delusion or he really could have been erased, meaning his identity taken from him by mind control and drugs. I won't go further with this. What I took away from this film was an uneasy feeling of coincidence, won't go into why. I liked the isolation of an island and the rocky cliffs with the crashing waves. I guess it gave off a remote piercing kind of feel, wild and beautiful. The isolation fed into the eerie hospital and adminstrator's personality. The apparation of the woman doctor,or was it, seemed intriguing again lending a question. Do you believe it? Could something like this be done? Absolutely. Would one want to be in a mental hospital like this. Was it pretending to be caring and concerned about unlocking the psyche from its unending hell or was it experimenting on people for the benefit of science or something else. These are again thoughts, questions. The atmosphere feels secretive and guarded so that suggests a possible dysfunction. The staff could have been looked at thru the eyes of a delusional patient so its all uncertain. There are parts that i would have liked to have viewed again but did not. Memories being taken? Feelings being medicated.",1278720000,2,3131,4.5828877005347595

It was occasionally difficult for me to determine when I was watching scenes from the past or in the present.  However, having said that, I must go on to say that all of the performances are excellent, especially DiCaprios and Ben Kingsleys.  The script, though confusing, is nonetheless well written and the production values are top-notch - as one has come to expect from a Scorsese film.  A perfect depiction of what it would be like to be a visitor stranded on a rain soaked island, in an asylum staffed by a sordid and disturbing cast of characters.",1278720000,,636,4.601769911504425
3606079,5,B001GCUO5M,"It has really nice scenes for HD viewing.  Dicaprio does a great job in his intensity and his confusion in dealing with his days attempting to solve a puzzle at the institution. Is he going after someone, trying to expose a conspiracy, or what? Ruffalo, Kingsley and von Sydow are just excellent in their delivery. Kingsley comes across as compassionate, then he is adversarial, then down right confusion. Since the movie takes place just a decade after WWII, you don't know if von Sydow's character is a former Nazi or not. This all adds to the issues that Dicaprio is attempting to uncover. I would have viewed this earlier if not for thinking it was more of a horror film. Overall, the plot is engaging and you are wondering when the next 'big thing' is going to happen. This film may only be a one time view for some. There are so many questions that you have throughout the movie and it seems they are answered at the end. However, the last shot creates a question, so, is what you have at the end the reality or not? Similar in ways to movies like 'The Green Mile' in its depiction of the death of three children or like the surprise you may remember at the end of 'The Sixth Sense.' This movie is sometimes very riveting and you are wondering if he is getting deeper into problems as the movie progresses. To me, there may have been a better viewership of this one if the trailers did not make it look like a horror movie. At least to me, seeing what they portrayed made it look like that more than a suspense thriller.",1278633600,,1526,4.392226148409894
3606080,5,B001GCUO5M,"If you don't like watching films twice, then I suggest you not view SHUTTER ISLAND even once. But if you do, you need to click over to the extra features on the DVD and watch ""The Making of Shutter Island."" It is here where you will begin to realize how important it is to restart the disc from the beginning.

Shutter Island is a film-within-a-film, about a character-within-a-character. The multiple layers and textures are unbelievably inviting in a very twisted sense. The entire film screams thriller, but after you view it a second time, it'll scream ...something entirely different.

Dividing audiences and critics, Shutter Island reveals itself to probably be too dense for many, but a revelatory success for others; I'm obviously in the latter category.

Leonardo DiCaprio (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Departed/dp/B000M5AJQI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Departed</a>) has rapidly become director Martin Scorsese's muse (and rightfully so). The two have been nearly inseparable since&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Gangs-of-New-York/dp/B002XUBDVK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Gangs of New York</a>. ""Marty"" saw something inside Leonardo and knew that he had the acting chops needed for some fairly tough roles. And here, on Shutter Island, Marty gives him his toughest role to date.

As soon as we see Federal Marshals Teddy Daniels (Leonardo) and his partner Chuck Aule (Mark Ruffalo,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Where-the-Wild-Things-Are/dp/B001HN699K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Where the Wild Things Are</a>) arrive on Shutter Island to investigate the disappearance of a mentally deranged prisoner, we get the immediate sense that things are off-balance. The guards look at Teddy and Chuck with great apprehension; their weapons pointed in Teddy and Chuck's general direction.

And as Teddy's investigation winds up, so do clues that don't match up. The possibility of a 67th patient being on the island, even though the warden and his charges claim there are only 66, tips Teddy (and the viewer) off that something is amiss.

The dark edges surrounding the island also leads Teddy into flashbacks of his time in WW II, and into other muted corners of his past that he'd rather not see.

It is these dark corners that intrigue Dr. Cawley (Ben Kingsley,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/You-Kill-Me/dp/B000UAE7KO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">You Kill Me</a>) and his partner Dr, Naehring (Max von Sydow,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Seventh-Seal/dp/B001WLMOG4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Seventh Seal</a>), themselves being psychiatrists. But we quickly garner that these two men are at opposite ends of the same field. And are they fighting each other over Teddy? If so, why?

It is here that I'll stop any further possibility of spoilers for those who choose to read this review. And it is also here that I need to reaffirm the requirement that you watch this movie twice.

When I first saw the trailer for this film, I was hooked...and deeply so, and wanted to go right out and see the film. However, after pondering on it for a day or so, I decided that it would be wrong not to read Lehane's book ""Shutter Island"" first, since I already knew he was a first class author/story teller from previously reading ""Mystic River"" a few years back (again, before seeing Clint Eastwood's film based upon that title). So, I did read the book, and then I became really worried that the film would not/could not live up to this absolutely jaw-dropping, heart-racing, horror story from hell and beyond; and so I waited until the dvd came out to see it. I'm sorry....to have seen this film in the confines of a blackened theater, with thx sound, etc., must have been overwhelming!

The horrors of this story are multifold, and bounce all over the place....stricken victims in the Nazi death camps, horribly-realistic revenge executions thereupon, booze, depression, drownings, murder, suicide, schizophrenia, experimental drugs and surgery on mental patients, and more are all alluded to here...and given a terrifying ""mix"" that will grab you and keep you locked in suspense and horror until the final gasp of the story.

Martin Scorsese deserves great thanks for NOT spoiling or watering-down this story in order to get it onto the screen...he has done a very commendable job here. Naturally, an entire book is difficult to ""translate"" and ""present"" in a movie, and certainly much is missing here....but not so much that the story does not work, nor carry the ""punch"" of the book.

I am not a DiCaprio fan, but I must say the man certainly has done his homework and applied it into his portrayal of Teddy Daniels....believe me, you WILL believe!

There are wonderful cameo roles throughout the film, certainly the stellar job done by Ben Kingsley, and those of Michelle Williams, and a great turn by Max von Sydow that will chill you deeply. Mark Ruffalo as Teddy's partner Chuck Aule is particularly fine throughout the film.

This story never lags, drags, or becomes boring in the least....the heat is continually being turned up another notch, and builds to a shattering climax....one that you will remember for a very very long time!

This film is a keeper, will entertain you many times over, and is believable enough, and deep enough, to remain true, and make you think deeper each and every time you see it!

Kudos, Mr. Scorsese, and your crew of actors and production people, for remaining true to Dennis Lehane's great book,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Shutter-Island/dp/0061703257/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Shutter Island</a>&nbsp;.

The movie just ends out of nowhere. The credits started to roll and I had to check and see if I had a bad disc that skipped to the end or something. Half of the movie was decent. Laying down clues for you to attempt to figure out what was happening. But it just ends out of nowhere with no solid crux to it.

Hollywood just loves to make the movies about mental wards. Why do they always show the scene with a patient raking the lawn. It's always the same scenes in these movies; tunnels, mazes, lighthouses, barred prison cells. Hurricanes, knocking out the power. On and on.

The cinematography was well done, except for some gore.

3606140,5,B001GCUO5M,"Shutter Island is an exquisitely crafted horror film noir that garbs your attention by the throat and never lets go until the very final frame of the picture. The acting is very convincing; Leonardo DiCaprio in particular gives one of his very best performances. The casting was thoughtfully done and this makes the film even more powerful; and the cinematography combined with the choreography pack quite a punch. The script was well written, too.

When the film starts we meet US federal marshals Teddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his new partner Chuck Aule (Mark Ruffalo) who are on their way by ferry to an eerie island off the Massachusetts coast where Ashcliff hospital for the dangerously criminally insane is located. One of the patients has escaped from her locked room; and the staff, including Dr. Cawley (Ben Kingsley) and Dr. Naehring (Max von Sydow) simply have no clue as to how she escaped and where she could be on this remote and foreboding island with its rocky cliffs--and no transportation to and from the mainland except for a single, highly guarded ferry boat. Unfortunately, however, Teddy and his partner Chuck are thwarted by Dr. Cawley, who refuses to make staff records available to them.

There's so much more that I can tell you without giving too much away. Right from the very beginning we can see how Teddy can't handle the water; his seasickness on the ferry boat to Shutter Island is just the beginning of what will prove to be a series of unpleasant and even horrifying things that happen to him. Moreover, Teddy's new partner doesn't know the real reason Teddy wanted this assignment. Teddy found out that the man who started a fire that killed his wife and daughter, Laeddis (Elias Koteas), is in the hospital there and Teddy wants revenge. Teddy also wants to ""blow the lid off"" what he thinks is the hospital's ability to secretly experiment on the mind using lobotomies and other questionable surgical procedures. In addition, slowly but surely we begin to see how Shutter Island resembles a concentration camp from World War Two that Teddy helped to liberate.

There's still so much more, but suffice it to say that gradually Teddy's flashbacks and other visions become more and more frequent and unsettling. His partner Chuck goes missing; will Teddy be able to find him? How does Teddy's World War Two experience factor into this? Will Teddy and his partner ever find the missing patient; or will they have to retreat and experience the embarrassment that they failed in their mission to locate the missing patient and, for Teddy, to get even with Laeddis?

It may well appear that I've given it all away; but there are still so many surprises and unexpected plot twists that I assure you I haven't. Indeed, the final fifteen to twenty minutes of the film provide such a, unexpected, shocking conclusion that it will haunt you for quite some while to come. Look also for good performances by Jackie Earle Haley as George Noyce and Patricia Clarkson as ""Rachel 2."" Michelle Williams is exceptionally good at playing Teddy's late wife, Dolores.

The DVD doesn't come with any extras; I would have loved a commentary with Scorsese, DiCaprio, Mark Ruffalo or even all three; but we just don't get it.

Shutter Island may not be for the faint of heart; but for those of us who choose to watch and own this movie on DVD will not be disappointed. There's so much suspense in this psychological thriller that it's truly remarkable; this will have a lasting impact on you. I highly recommend this film.",1277942400,2,3541,4.825370675453048
3606141,4,B001GCUO5M,"I go to the movies to be entertained, so I won't watch mind-polluting slasher horror movies. I watched the trailer for this movie in the theaters, and it turned me off. The movie certainly looked like a violent slasher movie, even though it was made by arguable the best director in the business Martin Scorsese. Scorsese usually has good taste. So I didn't see this till it came out on DVD.

Set in the mid fifties, Federal Marshall Teddy Daniels (Leonardo diCaprio) and his sidekick Chuch Aule (Mark Ruffalo) go to a maximum security metal institute for the criminally insane on Shudder Island. (You've seen this place before, in the Batman movies it's usually called Arkham Asylum, a reference to the books of HP Lovecraft).  The marshals are going to investigate the disappearance of an inmate who vanished as if she ""evaporated through the walls"". Daniels sees sights which stir his memories, as a WWII soldier he was amongst those who liberated the Dachau Concentration Camp. On Shudder Island he finds the creepy Dr Cawley (Ben Kingley) and creepier German Dr. Nehring (Max von Sydow) and wonders if they are hiding something.  DiCaprio searchers and unravels mysteries during a hurricane on the atmospheric, gothic Shudder Island.

I won't describe the plot and ending further, others have said far too much already. I will say the violence and tension is mostly  psycholgical, not graphic. And I'll say Marty did not disappoint me, despite the trailer, its is a well-directed, well-shot, well-acted, with a good screen play, a suspenseful movie to the end without gratuitous violence I'd feared. DiCaprio is turning into one of the best actors in America.  Having seen the movie, I should go back and re-watch it and see if it is logically coherent, seems like there may have been loose ends, maybe not.

It's not ""The Aviator"", ""Goodfellas"" or ""Gangs of New York"" but it's a better movie than I'd expected.

Severe mental illness had been dealt with in the past by locking away patients, chaining them to the walls or even beating them. By the fifties, there was the seemingly barbaric electroshock therapy, zapping their brains with high voltage (which I've read actually sometimes works). There was the more barbaric lobotomies, taking a knife, going between the eyeballs and the brain and slicing off the connection between the prefrontal lobe and the rest of the brain which left the violent patients passive zombies. (This happened to singer actress Francis Farmer and many others before being banned) . Then there was the new drug therapies like Thorazine. That was about it. Into this mix came Dr RD Laing who argued, with the non-violent patients, why not let these crazies walk around, act out their delusional fantasies, and talk to doctors like real people. Eventually they will logically conclude they aren't really Jesus Christ, Superman, or who ever these delusionals think they are. And they will be cured with logic and not psychiatry, drugs, knives or electric shocks.",1277856000,,2995,4.987975951903808

Similar in ways to movies like 'The Green Mile' in its depiction of the death of three children or like the surprise you may remember at the end of 'The Sixth Sense.'  This movie is sometimes very riveting and you are wondering if he is getting deeper into problems as the movie progresses.

To me, there may have been a better viewership of this one if the trailers did not make it look like a horror movie.  At least to me, seeing what they portrayed made it look like that more than a suspense thriller.

Dicaprio does a great job in his intensity and his confusion in dealing with his days attempting to solve a puzzle at the institution.  Is he going after someone, trying to expose a conspiracy, or what?  Ruffalo, Kingsley and von Sydow are just excellent in their delivery.  Kingsley comes across as compassionate, then he is adversarial, then down right confusion.  Since the movie takes place just a decade after WWII, you don't know if von Sydow's character is a former Nazi or not.  This all adds to the issues that Dicaprio is attempting to uncover.

3606166,4,B001GCUO5M,"I posted a question on Facebook asking what movie I should see, listing a couple of choices.  ""Shutter Island"" being one of them.  The overriding feedback all led to the eerie thriller starring Leonardo Dicaprio.  Of course I never really listen to anyone, so I chose another movie and ended up having to drink a couple glasses of scotch just to get through it.  Since I was blowing off the entire day I decided to take a shot on the horror classic remake, and to my surprise found it absolutely wonderful.  I am surprised at some of the negative reviews since I thoroughly enjoyed this film.

With most movies I pride myself on being able to predict the surprise twists or endings, but I have to admit, with this one I was totally shocked.  Leo is a freakishly tuned in investigator being sent to Shutter Island to investigate the disappearance of a psychiatric resident.  The island is a home for people who are not of sound mind.  The issue isn't as much about the disappearance of a lost woman, as it focuses more on the questionable practices of the island hospital staff.  It seems they might be conducting some freakish Nazi type experiments on a few of the patients.  Can we say ""water-boarding""?  Wait that is torture, anyway.........

Leo teams up with his new partner Mark Ruffalo and the two of them start deciphering the clues left by former doctors and some of the unstable residents.  If there ever was a reason not to smoke a cigarette, other than the cancer thing of course, I have now discovered that doctors sometimes lace them with narcotics.  Never trust a German doctor who attempts to hide his accent.  Sadly we quickly discover that Leo has some ulterior motives for taking the case as well.  Apparently his wife was killed by an arsonist, who happens to be living in one of the cell blocks.

So the movie meanders along, finding clue after clue and just when you think you know what is happening, bam, somebody hits you in the stomach and throws the entire plot and story into a frenzy.  I admit again, I had no idea where the movie was headed.  The only issue I had with the movie was believing some of the staff really went that far to freak old Leo out.  It makes sense to go the extra mile but hiding out in a cave with the only access coming from the side of a cliff, might require me to be paid more than a little overtime.

Overall I really enjoyed the film, and I would highly recommend seeing it.  It was a pleasant surprise in more ways than one.  Set aside the believability issues and you have a fantastic movie.  Even when you add them back to the equation, you have a very entertaining flick that will keep you guessing.  Assuming you don't already know the story of course",1277510400,,2712,4.472505091649695

If the Dr. Caligari story had not been done repeatedly so many times over the years, this film may have been surprising and more enjoyable. As with all hybrids, there were some tossed in dashes of ""The Manchurian Candidate"" (1962), ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" (1956) and maybe the kitchen sink for good measure and voila. Does Marin Scorsese think no one goes to the movies? He cannot be that naive. At least the actors (well known) were really acting and not walking through the script. Leonardo DiCaprio is believable as Teddy Daniels. The music is also a character and does not overwhelm the dialog. A nice touch was any blood looked more like theatrical makeup so it did not overwhelm the story.

As he starts to dig deeper and deeper into the case, he begins to wonder if somehow he is part of a much larger and twisted plot. Teddy quickly realizes that he must solve this case and get off the island before he loses his own ""sanity"".

This movie really deserves 4.5 stars. Scorcese is such a master of building a ""real"" world in his fims. You feel like it's 1954 from wardrobe to attitude. The acting in this film is wonderful! DiCaprio's range is incredible, which makes him a great actor. We will be watching Leo for decades to come. I will not spoil the movie in my review (I never do), but like the box says ""it deserves multiple viewings"". That is because once the mystery is revealed, you will want to watch the movie from a different perspective. An excellent film!

BLU RAY THOUGHTS: Paramount really does a nice job here. The colors are toned down to reflect not only the time, but the mood of the island and hospital. The pictures still remains crisp and every detail is captured to immerse you into the environment. The audio mix is good. SPECIAL FEATURES: Not much here, but the 2 featurettes included are great!

3606169,3,B001GCUO5M,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***

I have to liken 'Shutter Island' to another mystery-thriller: 'The Sixth Sense'. Both have a myriad of clues planted throughout the narrative, leading to a highly entertaining twist ending. I'll confess that I was pretty much fooled up until the climax but I did have my suspicions that things couldn't be what they seemed. At first, it seems that 'Shutter Island' is going to be a tale about some evil psychiatrists (aided and abetted by a corrupt staff) who are conducting secret experiments on a hapless population of psychiatric patients. Dr. Cawley (perfectly played by Ben Kingsley) does everything he can to stymie Federal Marshall Teddy Daniel's investigation including his refusal to hand over staff personnel folders. Before you know it, there are rumors that lobotomies are being performed at the lighthouse, on a different part of the island.

I became quite confused after the hurricane when Teddy and his partner Chuck (later revealed to be psychiatrist, Dr. Sheehan) are so easily able to walk into Ward C, where the most dangerous patients are housed. After all, if this was where all the really bad things were happening, wouldn't Cawley and his guards make it a point to prevent Teddy from learning Ward C's dark secrets? My best reasoning held that the marshals were able to slip into the off-limits area due to the confusion in the aftermath of the storm. But it didn't look right; the guards supposedly knew who Teddy was and they were simply letting him casually walk into the house of horrors where he does in fact learn that patients are being mistreated (i.e. lobotomized).

Was this simply an example of poor screen writing or was something more sinister afoot? As it turns out, Teddy's beliefs that everyone was out to get him on Shutter Island, was simply a paranoid fantasy. In fact, Teddy's 'investigation' was simply an elaborate role-play set up by Dr. Cawley, designed to break down Teddy's defenses. The ubiquitous Rachel Solando, who supposedly murdered her three children, was one of Dr. Cawley's staff members, pretending that she was a murderer in order to help Teddy realize that it was actually he who had murdered his wife after discovering that she had murdered their three children.

Because all of this calls for a great suspension of disbelief, Shutter Island ranks up there as a solid piece of film entertainment but holds it back from being considered a true 'artistic masterpiece' (as some have argued it is). There are three big problems with the film's narrative.

Firstly, there's a big assumption here that such role-playing could ever lead to such a huge improvement in a paranoid schizophrenic's psyche. Cawley and Sheehan concede that the role-playing can lead to a regression (as it did with Teddy nine months earlier, as they candidly admit). They call it a new ""experimental therapy"" but role-playing has been around for centuries. It looks awful nice how they get Teddy to confront his demons, but I would think that role-playing (as it's shown here) would tend to aggravate the patient, much more than it would lead to any kind of meaningful revelations.

That leads to the second problem: why would the Board of Overseers countenance such a therapy? After all, those are the guys who approve the lobotomies at the slightest hint of violence amongst the mentally ill population. Back in 1954, lobotomies were actually believed to be helpful for patients. Why would such do-gooders, such as Cawley and Sheehan, be given the chance to turn Teddy around? Not only don't I believe such people would be in charge of a Federal lock-up for the criminally insane but even if they were, they would not be allowed to conduct such a role-play experiment.

In reality such an experiment would place both the staff and the prison population in jeopardy. In a ridiculous scene, after Teddy bursts into the lighthouse, Cawley asks him, 'did you hurt the guard very badly?' In real life, he would never have been allowed to put any of the guards in jeopardy. Just imagine if Teddy actually had killed the guard by slugging him over the head with the rifle? And would Dr. Cawley allow his expensive European convertible to go up in smoke just to help the most dangerous patient on Stutter Island--simply out of the goodness of his heart?. I know he's a liberal but no one's that liberal when it comes to their own property that's worth so much money.

So without the role-play taking place, there's no twist ending and no accolades for Dennis Lehane, the author of the novel along with Director Martin Scorsese. Nonetheless, there's much to admire about this picture. Scorsese has a terrific way with camera angles. I love all the subtle closeups such as when the Dachau Commandant reaches for his gun, as he lays wounded in his office along with the old Victrola, with the record playing over and over. Scorsese sometimes overdoes things, especially with those scenes involving the murdered children at the end of the film (just a little too much blood for my tastes). All the performances are quite good here including Kingsley (as noted earlier) along with a very cool Max Von Sydow (who at first glance is supposed to be the bad guy but on second viewing, is quite benign).

Scorsese also smartly added the ambiguous line at the end suggesting that Teddy is cured but pretends to be insane since he can no longer live with the guilt of failing to save his children at the hands of his murderous wife.

This is the type of picture worth watching twice. The first time around you'll be in the dark; the second time you'll watch it for all the clues missed. But after that, there are no profound ideas here to sift through. In other words, an Ingmar Bergman film it ain't! But as a solid entertainment--it hits the mark!",1277337600,,5806,4.820281124497992
3606170,2,B001GCUO5M,"""Shutter Island"" is set in 1954 and the main character, Edward ""Teddy"" Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a former World War II soldier.  Teddy is now a U.S. Marshal that investigates the disappearance of a patient from a strange prison-like mental hospital on the rocky formidable East Coast Shutter Island.  The hospital is for the criminally insane.  Teddy is shown traveling on a boat to Shutter Island with his Deputy (Mark Ruffallo).  The waves and wind make him sick and he has to sit down when he reaches the office of the head of the institution. Ben Kingsley plays the man in charge and explains the radical treatments they perform here.  While Teddy is trying to get his ""land legs"" he is given a pill for headaches.

Teddy has strange dreams, flashbacks, visions during his investigation and paranoia sets in that he is being drugged or poisoned.  Teddy quizzes the head of the institution along with most of the staff on the disappearance of Rachel Solando (Emily Mortimer), a patient admitted after she murdered her three children.

The movie is filled with flashbacks, as you wonder why a U.S. Marshall was sent to such a place.  More and more psychological issues arise and Teddy suspects the authorities in charge are not telling him the truth.  The remote Ward C looms large in his mind, he thinks they are holding the arsonist who murdered his wife.

Secrets are unraveled that Teddy fights hard not to believe.

""Shutter Island"" is not that engaging and the abundance of eerie visions end up being more of a sideshow.

Scorsese had all the right ideas here, but at 140 minutes this was 30 too long for my taste, and didn't leave me feeling anything but somewhat disappointed, despite fine performances and a good story.

DiCaprio is excellent as usual, as is Kingsley, but the script takes too long to unfold, and after a while I began to smell the coming twist {spoilers on the way}. The bummer for me is that this film flirts with the incredible cinematic potential of the MK Ultra project, but backs off just when it could truly have broken new ground. Jacob's Ladder addresses many of the themes here much more convincingly, and if you liked this make sure to see that one. Both JL and Fight Club came to mind while watching this, but both of those brought it all home with much more weight.

This film looks very fine on blu-ray, and the subtle CGI adds to the paranoid feel. The music is rather too obvious and telegraphic, but clearly that was the idea. MS sure knows how to move a camera and compose a shot, truly a master. But this one needed way more editing to have the impact it wanted, and it all drags long enough that the ending is more a relief than a surprise.

Back to the MK Ultra theme, and the brief nod to Operation Paperclip (look them up if you don't know of them, and prepare to learn some incredible American history they left out of your schoolbooks): these are topics that are DYING to be turned into a truly classic film, and Scorsese is a perfect candidate. For a while here I was thrilled to think that these vital missing links in our post-war history would finally be looked at in depth, but they're merely passing fragments. Come on, Marty! You or Francis could make a movie about those topics that would change the way we see ourselves as a country, and maybe even influence present political culture for the better...so please do!

But in the meantime we get a very good-looking gothic throwaway, based on Lehane's novel but with little of his special touch. The Aviator and The Departed both blow this one out of the water, and while Scorsese and DiCaprio still make a fine team, I'm looking forward to another outing from them of higher quality once again, with more incision and less scattershot intensity.",1277078400,8,2237,4.51358024691358

3606203,4,B001GCUO5M,"Master filmmaker Martin Scorsese has returned to the big screen with his first full-length feature film in four years (2006's The Departed-winner of the Academy Award for Best Picture). Shutter Island tells the story of U.S. Marshall Teddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his partner Chuck Aule (Mark Ruffalo). The two Marshalls are called upon to investigate the mysterious escape and disappearance of a dangerous patient (Emily Mortimer) at Ashecliffe Hospital, an isolated and stark facility saturated with dark secrets, and run by the ominous Dr. Cawley (played magnificently by Ben Kingsley), and his associate, Dr Nehring (Max von Sydow). Everyone on the island seems to be hiding something, including the patients, who are mostly there for horrific and violent crimes.

Daniels and his partner begin to suspect that Cawley and his institution have hidden agendas, and as they dig deeper and deeper into the island's secrets, their investigation takes strange and startling turns, which lead them to wonder if they will ever be able to leave. The story is set in 1954, which allows Scorsese to skillfully play around with genre, and to tie in post WWII themes and looming Cold War fears and conspiracies. Daniels' traumatic experiences at concentration camps weave in and out of his dreams, as do visions of his deceased wife, Delores (Michelle Williams).

A great admirer of Scorsese's films, it's no surprise to me that his newest work has managed to seep deep into my thoughts, and to lurk there long after I've exited the theatre. Notice the words ""seep"" and ""lurk"". The diction I've decided on here is no accident, but rather a fluid way of describing the means by which the film works on our senses. It slowly and meticulously grinds its rusty gears toward the fascinating climax, and the foreboding hurricane approaching the island heightens the stakes and greatly enhances the atmosphere that Scorsese and veteran cinematographer, Robert Richardson, immerse us in. This will inevitable be compared to Scorsese's remake of Cape Fear in 1991, as well it should be. They are both exercises in pure style, and I myself went into this with Cape Fear in mind. It's better to examine this as a separate entity, and to appreciate the stylish elements by which the characters come to realizations and revelations.

Dennis Lehane, whose previous novels Mystic River and Gone Baby Gone were also made into excellent films, wrote the source novel. His material seems to translate very well from page to screen, and I look forward to reading the novel in the future. This may not be the best adaptation of his work, but it is certainly the most prominent of the three films, and that has everything to do with Scorsese's ferocity and craftsmanship. He doesn't make wimpy movies, and this is no exception. It's a B Movie, but its one made by a director who knows exactly what he's doing every step of the way. It's fragmented, sure, but maybe it needs to be that way.

Leonardo DiCaprio manages to deliver one of his finest performances as the tortured and hard-edged Teddy Daniels, and Mark Ruffalo does some excellent work here as his timid partner. Scorsese plays off of Hitchcock a lot in this film, and like in any Hitchcock movie, everyone is suspicious, and the truth is buried beneath layers of deceit. As more and more layers are peeled away from their surroundings, they become part of something much grander and enigmatic that they were sent for. The facility is a fortress, surrounded by electric fences and treacherous cliffs, which stormy waves slosh and grind against, corroding away the rocks below. It's a long way down.",1276905600,2,3637,4.967159277504105

3606205,3,B001GCUO5M,"This is one I really just assumed I would like. I did but not in the same ways I anticipated nor anywhere near as much as I expected. The direction and acting are all up to snuff, of course. The camera work is great, depicting a stark and spooky place that none of us would want to go to, be it as a guard, physician or inmate. This is a crew who really know movies from each of their respective roles and for the most part I don't think you will be dissapointed.

The problem, to me, is the story, which really keeps you interested and guessing...until you figure it out , which really won't take that long. I'm not saying you will work out all of the details but when you get that little tickle early on and think you have the gist figured out, guess what? You do. The only thing worth staying to the end for is to find out why and how, which is really not that satisfying or even remotely believable.

Of course you may think it's great and if so, great, it's money well spent. Let's just say I went to the RedBox for this and if I had shelled out more than a buck to see it I would have probably been a bit more critical.",1276819200,,1125,4.040358744394619
3606206,5,B001GCUO5M,"I'm a fan of Dennis Lehane, the author of the book, and was thrilled when I found out that Shutter Island was going to be made into a movie with such a renowned director and talented cast. I still remember reading the book for the first time and calling my husband at work -- he'd all ready read it - just to say ""wow"" and to discuss it with another person. I think I'd figured out the big bad secret by the end, but loved how the author pulled it all together.

So, when I saw the movie I did so from a ""knowing"" perspective and so my experience was actually vastly different from someone who hadn't read the book. If you're unfamiliar with it, I think it's easy to go in and think that the ease or difficulty with which you figure it out is the point -- and it's not. Because I knew, I got to enjoy the execution of the story and the acting and directing choices that were made and could only be noticed either if you have the knowledge or in retrospect. I had extra moments of delight because I could think, ""Oh, I see what he did there! What a great reaction shot under the circumstances!"" The movie rewards your understanding what's going on. So, even for the people who figured it out and were perhaps disappointed, it's worth another viewing with complete understanding. I also loved that one of the extras on the bluray discusses this exact thing.

The movie is atmospheric, Scorsesian, and Hitchcockian. The story and direction compliment one another. I think, at its core, this is a very human stories about both the limitations and the limitlessness of the mind and heart. The protagonist, Teddy Daniels, remains a complex and compelling figure. Dicaprio clearly respected that complexity and committed to bringing it to his performance. The rest of the cast also does a stellar job and it is impossible to single anyone out, because they were all up to the challenge.

I absolutely recommend this movie and this author. So, even if you don't buy the movie but are a reader, you might want to check out more from Dennis Lehane.",1276819200,7,2038,4.487870619946092

There is nothing original about that movie, and the Hong Kong version which it was based upon is superior. That is just the way things are in Hollywood. What is Scorsese trying to do here? Make another 6th Sense? At the end of 6th Sense, there was this revelation, ""ah, everything all make sense now"". At the end of this one, after following the plot the whole time and it just spent five minutes trying to convince you that this indeed was the truth, there is just no way it could work.

3606211,4,B001GCUO5M,"Shutter Island is a very ambiguous film. I knew exactly what direction it was going in about halfway through it, and yet, after the credits rolled, my mind was a jumble trying to decipher what I just watched. In my opinion, I don't think the ending was as crystal clear as the film would like you to believe. The 'Is Teddy sane or insane?' arguments are abundant on the internet. The movie would like you to believe that he is indeed, insane and there is proof from the very beginning. However, one can counter that for all the evidence, it can still very easily be twisted so that the other argument wins out. It is not as dry cut as it appears, or as they state. This movie desperately needs multiple viewings.

In my mind, the final truth that confirmed the 'sane' argument was that final haunting shot of the lighthouse. The people that saw this film know what I am talking about. There are so many theories going around and I honestly think the whole point of this film is to make people crazy trying to figure everything out.

Many people who don't like Shutter Island call it a cop-out and a huge 'gocha!' joke. I can see how that would frustrate someone-that is, if you believe the 'insane' argument. This can go back and forth. I haven't seen a movie like this in ages, where you go back in your mind days after watching it and still try to reason things out.

The performances are top-notch and the cinematography is just stunning. The colors are bold in a non-colorful way, but they stand out nonetheless. The imagery and lighting really sets the tone and I actually loved the over-the-top musical score. It almost made it seem like you were in the middle of a horror film, which this is not. But it still fits so perfectly because it really is the ideal way to set the scene, especially when it revolves around a creepy mental asylum.

Truly, I would go into this film knowing as little about it as possible and allow the suspense and mystery to overtake you.",1276560000,2,1971,4.4515235457063715
3606212,5,B001GCUO5M,"Something has happened on Shutter Island and it is up to two law enforcement officals to figure out what. One is a seasons veteran and the other is his new partner, and they both find themselves pulled into something that seems much more difficult than a case of a missing woman. This leads the lead detective to question what is going on, and before long he finds himself wondering what secrets lie in this place that holds so many secrets about everything - including himself.

On many levels, I thought this film was a great piece of work. It had all the elements one would want from a movie develing into a place that treats the worst types of criminal minds, with it looking at everything through the eyes of both patients and detectives. It has secret plots and twists, a lot of things you can't trust, and a plot that leaves you wondering what Leo really knows as he walks through his investigation.

There were a few times in the movie I found myself able to predict what was going on, and some of that really hurt the ending. I think that is because movies have to have some catch these days, but this catch is one that is both interesting and hard to talk about without saying too much. If, for instance, you review for content, you will say too much. Even discussing characters says some things that possibly shouldn't be said. So, instead of going that route, I will simply say that the plot is great, the effects have an impact, and the end is one that completes a puzzle and makes you feel sorrow at the same time.

Would I say buy this film? I'm torn on that one. I would say that you would like to watch it more than once, and that it would be something that makes more sense as you catch all the little pieces. Still, I didn't benifit from the buy itself because I watched all these parts all at once, but cannot find a reason that a person would not want to buy it simply because it has so much to offer.

Read reviews on it, be really careful if a person says anything about spoilers, and enjoy your film. You will enjoy it, too, because it is hard not to. Its like a puzzle you have to put together and, when you do, you find yourself rewarded.
Personally, I liked what Leo did here, and the way his character brings everything to light.",1276560000,,2257,4.316037735849057
3606223,4,B001GCUO5M,"Having never read Dennis Lehane's novel, I didn't quite know what to expect of Shutter Island, which re-unites Leonardo DiCaprio and Martin Scorsese but finds the legendary director in a bit of a change of pace with this suspense/thriller as opposed to his past few works.  DiCaprio plays Teddy Daniels, a U.S. Marshal who, along with his partner Chuck (Mark Ruffalo) come to the island to investigate the disappearance of an inmate of the island's hospital for the criminally insane.  What begins as a ""whodunit with everyone hiding something"" develops into something else entirely, with a twist that you will more than likely see coming almost a mile away.  That aside though, Shutter Island as a whole is a more than competantly made thriller.  DiCaprio is quite good, as are Ruffalo and Ben Kingsley as the facility's head doctor, with smaller roles from Michelle Williams, Max Von Sydow, Patricia Clarkson, Jackie Earle Haley, Emily Mortimer, and Ted Levine; while the film boasts some wonderful cinematography and film editing.  With a fairly unsettling conclusion, Shutter Island may not be the kind of film that one would expect from Martin Scorsese, but if there's anything that the legendary director may be familiar with, it's with providing audiences with the unexpected, and that in itself makes the film so worthwhile in the first place.",1276560000,2,1351,5.095022624434389
3606224,4,B001GCUO5M,"Martin Scorsese has given us a film depiction of the inglorious book written by Dennis Lehane. The book was an abrupt turn from the kind of books Lehane had written. The book was a best seller and this film should be right there up with the novel.

Leonardo DiCaprio delivers an exquisite performance as the Federal Marshall who comes to Shutter Island to solve the mystery of a lost woman patient. Shutter Island is an Insane Asylum for the Criminally Insane, and quite an island it is. Off the coast of Boston Harbor this island is one of your worst nightmares. Marshall Teddy Daniels and his new partner, played by Mark Ruffalo, team up together to solve the mystery. But, what they find is a series of mysteries upon mysteries, and the more they
look, the more bizarre the situation becomes. Bit by bit Teddy becomes more involved and caught up in the nightmare of the treatments that are occurring on this island. The anxiety that becomes Teddy becomes our anxiety and the old Nazi captains and the stories of children drowning become more real. Take a ride with Teddy in this insane, mad world. What you will discover is so antithetical to anything you ever believed possible. This is a glorious tale, told with the majesty of Martin Scorsese. The  soundtrack from Robbie Robertson is ominous and stunning.

Highly Recommended.  prisrob 06-15-10

There are some very disturbing images throughout the films:  dead, frozen bodies in a concentration camp; other dead people; horrible conditions in the ward for the most dangerous prisoners, etc.  Be warned. This might not be for you if you are easily upset or prone to nightmares.

3606228,3,B001GCUO5M,"I actually watched Shutter Island twice this past weekend. Wait, that's not 100% accurate. The first time I watched it I kept falling asleep; at one point I think I was out for a good 20 minutes. So I watched it again in the daytime on Sunday, and it turns out the movie wasn't quite as bad as me falling asleep might have made it sound.

After a clear-minded viewing (versus my original attempt after an exhaustingly long week and a couple of beers), I can say that Shutter Island had some decent moments. I don't know why but even in the first few moments of my initial viewing, something seemed very familiar about the movie. I already knew what the twist was going to be. I mean, I didn't predict all of the intricacies leading up to the twist, but I knew...I just knew!...where we'd end up when the final minute of the long 2 hours plus of a movie's credits rolled.

I'm telling ya, I saw a Twilight Zone, Outer Limits or SOMETHING that had the exact same kind of twist...I just can't put my finger on it. There are great movies with great twists all the time (like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Sixth-Sense/dp/B001BRZ5J2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Sixth Sense</a>) that catch me totally off guard at the end, but Shutter Island just didn't.

Making matters worse was a storyline that you really have to take with a grain of salt and give the benefit of the doubt to. Not that the trauma of Shutter Island's 67th patient wasn't indeed traumatic. It's just I had a hard time swallowing the whole idea that such an elaborate scheme could be pulled off. I guess that in a perfect world (poor choice of words for a place like Shutter Island) it could happen, but boy did the stars have to line up perfectly.

What the film lacked in believability and 'keeping it simple' (and short), it made up for in atmosphere. I don't know about everyone else, but Director Martin Scorsese made me feel like I was on Shutter Island and that was a creepy, helpless feeling; the movie gets an extra star for that. Scorsese created a living, breathing&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Arkham-Asylum/dp/1401204252/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Arkham Asylum</a>&nbsp;where the only things missing were the most notorious villains and the Caped Crusader himself. When did the nuts take over the nuthouse?

Oh, and a final word on the acting: great. If you like a psychological thriller and you have a lot of patience, you'll probably like Shutter Island, so move on to the 4 or 5 star reviews for advice that's probably more in line with how Shutter Island will affect you. I think 2+ hours was a long time to get to the point, and I could have used a little more action and suspense to get me to the end...in a conscious state.",1276473600,3,2803,4.905063291139241

3606231,4,B001GCUO5M,"Though not quite be amongst Scorsese's very best (like Goodfellas!) in my opinion it is in the next tier down and comparable to ones like ""The Departed"" (and unlike that, this isn't a remake so far as I know...).

As the movie begins the primary protagonist (played by DiCaprio) is an outside investigator en route to ""Shutter Island"" (used by the government entirely as a mental institute) to investigate the disappearance of one of the inmates...even though escape from the cells is supposedly impossible!  As the movie proceeds the main character notices certain things seem off  and that he does not seem to be getting the full story by the institutions' authority figures. Dicaprio's character is also unstable and suffers flashbacks of his experiences in WWII as well as other experiences....  As the plot deepens it takes on one of a good mystery...the protagonist and the audience clearly know there's some secret behind ""shutter island, but we don't know what it is.

This does have the feel of being a bit of a ""throwback"" to previous movie eras- it's set in the fifties and is just a good-old fashioned mystery/suspense/thriller not tied to current events or overtly to politics.  Also, in an age we seem to be in of movies with ambiguous endings - either for the sake of not having a good ending or setting up a sequel - this movie has a definite good old ""beginning,"" ""middle,"" and ""end.""  In other words the audience is given answers...even though there may be aspects left for the audience to determine the meaning of.  The movie did start to drag slightly at the latter parts, and I was ready to just get to the ending already.  Also, although the movie reminded me of a couple other older movies, it had a different ""twists"" from those.

Some have implied this is ""weaker"" Scorsese...I would not describe it as that, though it may not be the type of movie that he will ultimately be remembered for.  He may have wanted to dabble in the suspense/thriller genre....and I think we're lucky he did!  After all I think some of his historical movies like ""Gangs of New York"" and ""The Aviator"" dipped at least slightly in quality in comparison to earlier ones.  This probably puts him somewhat into the Spielberg camp- making important drams, but also a few adventure movies along the way like this....

3606254,1,B001GCUO5M,"Scorcese would get the Ed Wood award with this awful movie, except Wood's movies are so bad and campy they are fun to watch. This thing takes itself very seriously.  The whole premise is evident in the opening scene where DiCaprio and Ruffulo are the only people on a big ferry crossing a harbor, dressed in standard G-man costumes (trench coats, fedoras, etc.). When they arrive at the dock of the wacko hospital they have to surrender their guns to the guards. Ruffalo, who is supposed to be a veteran lawman, can't even get his pitiful little revolver and holster out of his waist band.  So it's evident these two clowns aren't really federal marshals but some amateur's misconception, like a child playing soldier not knowing how a gun really works.  This may have been ""borrowed"" from A Beautiful Mind, or Angel Heart or some pretentious French movie.

It's evident in the first ten minutes that the LD character has some heavy mental issues, including the inability to stay in reality - there are gruesome scenes of him as a GI liberating Dachau with the bodies of murdered Jews everywhere, some that open their eyes, tell him he should have helped them, etc.,  and a scene where he and the other GI's massacre the concentration camp guards, which of  course did not happen. On the other hand a lot of the people who watch this crap probably don't even know which decade WWII was fought in.  The plot borrows from the real life horror story of Andrea Yates, the Houston psycho-mom who drowned her five children in the bath tub.  This movie is a grab bag of ""ideas"" and incidents - Nazi medical experiments, CIA mind control and experiments on humans, and a rip off from the old t.v. soap opera Dallas where we find that  nothing in the whole season where Bobby supposedly died really happened, but was just a bad dream, except in this case SPOILER COMING NOW - the main character wakes up from his nightmare/delusion to find that he is - guess who - the husband of the Andrea Yates character whom he murdered for drowning their children, and went wacko and got sent to the nervous hospital, where he is about to get a lobotomy.

What makes this movie such a waste is the presence of some great actors including LD, Ben Kingsley and Max von Sydow, and very good, atmospheric cinematography.  It has to be depressing to them and Scorcese to have wasted a year or more of their lives on this, but maybe the money salves the wounds.",1276387200,21,2434,4.572413793103448

3606256,4,B001GCUO5M,"When I first started posting reviews here umpteen aeons ago, I swore to myself that I wouldn't read other people's reviews before contributing my own. Then I got too curious & broke my own rule. Now I generally read one good review & almost all of the really bad (one star) ones. It never ceases to amaze me that each group saw the same film. Personally, I think a lot of it is sheer emotional reaction, but I still find it informative.

Take SHUTTER ISLAND. I agree with the people who found DiCaprio's performance less than stellar, but not too bad. There are two problems I've experienced with his acting as seen in other films. He does this sort snear, curling his mouth up & then combines it with a sort of sorting look. I think it's supposed to look ""working class tough,"" but it lacks authenticity to me. [Tom Cruse did the same sort of thing in WAR OF THE WORLDS, but then I don't think many people expect authenticity from him.] The other thing about DeCaprio is that he doesn't handle accents very well--actually, not well at all. Following his outstanding portrayal of an autistic boy in WHAT'S EATING DELBERT GRAPE? there are fans who do expect authenticity from him.

All that aside, feminine eyes might glow in the scene where his character wears a ""wife-beater"" (tank top style, white cotton undershirt, ain't post-modern fashion grand?), clearly indicating that the lad has been working out.

Well, that's about all the sex you'll get in the movie, but that's not so bad...?

Being an unrepentant 60's Tripster, I liked the psychedelic overtones in the film, as well as the cinimatography, set design, use of color, the highly atmospheric overall ""feel"" and, of course, the direction of an American Master. The end left things unresolved, but it may always provide a hook to watch this mysterious ISLAND again.

Oh yes, Ben Kingsley was appropriately diabolical looking & acting. Max von Sydow was almost unrecognizeable & diabolical as well.",1276300800,2,1958,4.781065088757397
3606257,5,B001GCUO5M,"I think that some of the mixed things I'd heard about it come from the fact that some audiences were a) expecting something different and b) don't like to think. To be fair the studio mislead them by selling Shutter Island as a fun, edge of your seat, thrill ride.  It's really a psychological drama disguised as a B grade horror movie. It indulges in all the gothic tropes: the isolated mental hospital, the hurricane that cuts everything off from civilization, hints of Nazi experiments, even the music plays into it. But really that's just the setting. If you take it as the whole thing, that's where you'll run into disappointment. It's more about what's happening in the mind of the main character- which is a puzzle in itself- than the big twist ending.  I think that The Sixth Sense and others of it's ilk did a disservice to audiences in a sense. People look for the ""trick"" in movies, studios advertise the ""big twist ending"". But this isn't a movie about a twist. Yes, there's a big reveal in the end, and  the ""what"" of the reveal is fairly obvious. It's the ""how"" and the ""why"" that we should be thinking about. These are the answers to the psychological puzzle of the film. People get so into the ""what"" after being groomed on twist endings that they forget there is a ""how"" and a ""why"". When the big reveal comes it's more about the catharsis, the coming full circle, the emotional confrontation, than the twist itself.

Yes, it can be confusing not to know whether the main character is dreaming or hallucinating, or really seeing what is. But with patience that becomes clear and the beautifully photographed, eerily haunting dream sequences are worth watching without trying to ""figure them out"".  Just enjoy the performances (impressive across the board), the score, the cinematography, and go where the film takes you. Some might call the ending a cop out.

3606262,4,B001GCUO5M,"In 1954, U.S. Marshal Edward ""Teddy"" Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his partner, Chuck Aule (Mark Ruffalo), go to the Ashecliff Hospital for the criminally insane on Shutter Island. They are assigned there to investigate the disappearance of a female patient who apparently disappeared from a locked room. The chief psychiatrist Dr. John Cawley (Ben Kingsley), explains that she was committed after drowning her three children.

The Marshals run up against one wall after another in their investigation including the refusal by Cawley to turn over patient files and a generally uncooperative staff that includes Max Von Sydow as Dr. Naehring, another psychiatrist.  Daniels and Naehring quickly form an intense dislike of one another as Naehring is German and Daniels was part of a U.S. Army battalion that liberated the infamous Dachau Death Camp during World War II.  As a storm prevents the Marshals from returning to the mainland, Teddy begins to lose a grip on his own reality, having flashbacks to the horrific images at the death camp and suffering debilitating headaches.  He is determined to get to the island's lighthouse, convinced that it may hold the key to the mystery despite having been told that the guards have already searched it.  The mystery only deepens when the escaped patient is miraculously found.

Directed by Martin Scorsese, Shutter Island is based on Dennis Lehane's 2003 novel of the same name.  Lehane also wrote Mystic River and Gone, Baby Gone, which has some of the same elements as Shutter Island.  What strikes you first is the amazing visuals and the foreboding atmosphere of Ashecliff.  Built atop the rocky island off Boston, part of the facility had formerly been used as a fort during the Civil War.  It hints of the gothic castles and mansion from old Universal Studios horror films.  The island quakes with thunder and lightning, jolting you off the comfy confines of your sofa.

Scorsese positions Cawley and Naehring as sinister forces, purposely keeping the Marshals at bay to deep their dark secrets hidden.  Daniels and Aule soon theorize that the facility might have a more ominous purpose.  The pair scurry about like rats in a maze, checking every corner but making little progress in their investigation.

Scorsese indulges himself a little too much with the scenery, liberally borrowing bits from noir films and even cannibalizing some of his own films like Cape Fear.  The many flashbacks to Daniels' experiences during the war only serve to reveal Scorsese's hole card much too soon.  About halfway through the film you think there's no way that it can be going down THIS path with a twist that has been done all too frequently in other recent thriller/horror films.  Despite this near fatal flaw, Scorsese manages to pull it all together in the end.

DiCaprio gives a solid performance, even if he does look silly in his fedora.  You can feel his growing unease every step of the way. The show stealer is Kingsley whose character combines equal parts creepy and campy.  The fine supporting cast includes Jackie Earle Haley, Patricia Clarkson, and Ted Levine.

Despite some of its flaws, Shutter Island is a worthwhile view thanks to its nightmarish imagery and strong performances.",1276214400,,3239,5.048872180451128
3606273,5,B001GCUO5M,"It goes without saying that Martin Scorsese is an incredible filmmaker. He has added another classic to his resume with the mind-bending thriller, ""Shutter Island"".  The film stars Leonardo DiCaprio as a federal marshal who is investigating the disappearance of a patient / prisoner from a mental institution for the criminally insane.  DiCaprio shines in his part, perhaps brighter than he has in any other Scorsese film. He is accompanied by Ben Kingsley, Mark Ruffalo, Max von Sydow, Ted Levine and Jackie Earle Haley, amongst others. ""Shutter Island"" does a great job of playing mind games with the viewer.  This film makes for a great DVD to own, because you can watch it as many times as you would like and you can discover new clues in the plot over and over again. Also, after viewing the film the first time, once you know the outcome of the plot, subsequent viewings are really terrifying if you put yourself in the main character's shoes, knowing the ending.  That's what I do when I watch the film now, and I think it's genuinely scary because it is so competently written. Scorsese's direction is excellent, as are all the actors' performances in the film.  The film is a dark noir styled trip down the rabbit hole that is frightful and tense throughout.  Definitely a modern Scorsese classic here, folks.  Well worth checking out, multiple times.

3606274,4,B001GCUO5M,"SHUTTER ISLAND is Martin Scorsese's venture into Alfred Hitchcock territory.

This is one of those movies that makes me a bit angry.  At 90-105 minutes, it could have been a classic of the genre, but like so many of Scorsese's movies (e.g. GANGS OF NEW YORK, THE AVIATOR), he lets it go on far too long.  137 minutes to be exact.

Don't misunderstand.  I think that Scorsese is one of our finest living filmmakers, and SHUTTER ISLAND is an extremely well-made picture.  However, what Marty doesn't seem to get is that ""less is more"".

Without going into plot specifics, the first act of the picture works very well.  Scorsese creates a wonderful spooky, haunted house-like atmosphere that totally draws you into the story.

But, the second act is a total mess.  It wanders all over the place and, rather than my jumping in my seat when the director probably hoped that I would do so, I found myself wondering when the movie was going to get to its overdue climax.  In other words, I was bored.

However, there is a twist that leads into the third act that totally took me by surprise and from that point on, I was back with the movie.

I just wish that Scorsese and company could have gotten to that point sooner.

This is definitely no criticism of the actors, but I would have cut the roles played by Ted Levine and Elias Koteas.  They were totally unnecessary and their scenes did not move the story forward.  I would have also cut some of Michelle Williams' scenes for the same reason.

3606275,5,B001GCUO5M,"Too rarely are we offered films that are so well written (Laeta Kalogidis does a marvelous adaptation of Dennis Lahane's mesmerizing novel) that after viewing the audience is almost afraid to leave the theater or home screen for fear they may have missed some important information that will help them figure out why the story is so successfully enigmatic.  Such is the case for Martin Scorsese's brilliant film, SHUTTER ISLAND. It is only in retrospect, after the shock of the film is over, that the magic of quality cinematic achievement can be appreciated.  Then in rethinking the events the film portrays so well the story is as straightforward as Scorsese's vision.

The film opens in 1954  nothingness - from out of the fog slowly appears a ship headed toward Shutter Island, a terrifying prison for the criminally insane, and almost incidentally we meet US Federal Marshal Teddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio) emetically cloistered in a ship's lavatory while his newly assigned partner Chuck Aule (Mark Ruffalo) awkwardly waits for him on deck.  The two are on a mission to investigate the escape of a female prisoner.  They are greeted by curious wardens who escort them onto the terrifyingly ugly and ominous island to meet with the famous psychiatrist Dr. Cawley (Ben Kingsley) and Dr. Naehring (Max von Sydow).  Curious restrictions are placed on the Marshals who decide to return to Boston because of lack of cooperation from the psychiatrists.  A hurricane prevents their exit and slowly the story unwinds: Daniels is haunted by memories of his war experience in viewing the concentration camps in Dachau and delusion of his wife Dolores (Michelle Williams) in nightmares he cannot explain.  The various aspects of the Marshals' investigation lead them to all of the compounds where prisoners are kept and treated and surgically altered and the terror mounts.  To tell more of the story of one man's descent in to madness would distract from the viewer's own grappling with the conundrum of this tale.  It must be seen to appreciate the brilliance of the story.

In addition to superb performances by DiCaprio, Ruffalo, Kingsley, von Sydow, and Williams there are astonishing well crafted cameos by Patricia Clarkson, Elias Koteas, Emily Mortimer, John Carroll Lynch and a very large cast of bit players. The cinematography is superbly crafted by Robert Richardson.  The music score for this moody piece is a montage of works by such brilliant composers as Gyrgy Ligeti, Krzystof Penderecki, John Cage, Morton Feldman, Schnittke, Lou Harrison, John Adams and even Gustav Mahler whose rarely heard 'Quartet for Piano and Strings in A minor' plays a significant role in the film.  On all accounts this is a superb film. Why it did not do well in the theatrical run is puzzling: perhaps it is a long film that is way ahead of its time.  Watch it on DVD and become absorbed by all the bizarre mysteries it captures. Grady Harp, June 10",1276128000,3,2941,4.985685071574642
3606276,5,B001GCUO5M,"SHUTTER ISLAND is not what I expected. From the previews & trailers, I expected that I would be scared. I wasn't scared, although I was completely compelled from top to bottom. Thank the lord that great Directors like Martin Scorsese are still around who prove that you don't have to do 'popcorn movie' stuff to keep audiences rivoted. You can capture an audience with perfectly timed scenes and haunting sounds of a lonely and secluded Shutter Island, home for hundreds of the criminally insane... or just with a great and subtle performance from a really good actor.

When you think of Martin Scorsese, you think of Goodfellas, Casino, Taxi Driver & Raging Bull. With SHUTTER ISLAND, you forget about who made the movie, and that's a good thing. You get sucked in, you don't have expectations. From the quiet opening scene where you hear the horn of the fishing boat approaching the Island as the waves hit the side of the boat to the crippling finale, Scorsese paints a beautiful picture.

SHUTTER ISLAND isn't gonna get the accolades that some of Scorsese's film have, but to be perfectly honest, it should have been nominated for best picture this year. DiCaprio should have been nominated. Scorsese, in my mind, proved this year that he's above and beyond the working directors today. He's still an artist. While everybody else is answering to their studios to apease the BLOW IT UP & NOBODY CARES ABOUT EMOTIONS crowd, Scorsese is still the great artist that he's always been.

necessarily, I will say that it took the long route to get to the point!
They could've easily shaved off 20 to 25 minutes of this film,
tightened up the storyline and overall flow, and then I would've
said  ""ANOTHER BRILLIANT SCORSESE MASTERPIECE!!""...but alas, I can't
call this one masterpiece by any stretch of the imagination. (-:

Now don't get me wrong, Martin Scorsese is a true genius, a master
storyteller, and an icon of cinema whose work will be discussed and
studied for as long as there are people on earth who watch movies!
He has given us some truly brilliant films over the years, acted by some
of the most brilliant actors of our times...mainly one Robert DeNiro and
as of late, his new muse for the last few films, Leonardo DiCaprio,
who is cut from the same cloth of artistic excellence and total commitment
to whatever his current role requires.
But I'm a fan of Scorsese's more straight ahead masterworks like
""Taxi Driver"", ""Raging Bull"", ""King Of Comedy"", ""Casino"" and of course,
""Goodfellas"", which is argubly one of his best!
His films are always multi-layered, deep, well-developed, well-acted, etc.
even when they are straight ahead stories which everybody can follow and
get right into away. Even with those films, every time you watch them,
you catch a subtle nuance that you missed before that makes you like it even more.

But as of his last few films, mainly ""The Departed"" as well as
""Shutter Island"", I think he is taking the multi-dimensional thing a
bit too far and getting a little too cryptic for his own good!
Just my opinion. (Though I later came to appreciate ""The Departed""
more with time and 3 or 4 viewings.)
To me, there is just too much going on in this story that,
by the time it all comes together in the end, it isn't as much a
surprise as it was a bit of a relief that the mental rollercoaster ride is over!
Yes, yes, I know...it's supposed to be a mind-boinking of sorts,
but it could've done it and brought us all to the money shot in
much less time than it did!
Having said that, I completely bought Leo DiCaprio's, Mark Ruffalo's
and Sir Ben Kinsley's performances hook line & sinker, and applaud them
for what they brought to it. There are some stunning visual sequences
as well, but the cinematography is usually always on point in a Scorsese film.
I must say though, that I'm much more happier that I rented it instead of
buying it just on the strength of Martin Scorsese's reputation.
(That's what happened when I bought ""The Departed"")
Again, I would hardly say this was a masterpiece, but it's
interesting enough to watch at least twice, then if you want to buy it for
your home DVD collection, then that's on you!  (-:",1276128000,2,2756,4.550403225806452

In a nutshell, the Good:

1.  Visually this movie is tops - plenty of interesting set pieces, camera angles and deliveries, lighting, and design from the opening scene where I couldn't tell if the ocean was genuinely part of the scene or super imposed- maybe it was just me but Im assuming the director did that on purpose.  The sky in the movie reminded me of Cape Fear.  I also watched this movie in 1080 blu ray HD.

Set pieces are engaging, especially the ""haunted house like"" interior of the doctor's office/ library.

One of my favorite shots was at one point Leo is in this staircase that looks like an M C Escher print - possible tribute maybe? Cool!

2.  Sound and score fits the mood

3.  Acting is good enough but other attributes of the movie gripped me more.

4.  Story is interesting - its not formulaic like 80% of the US summer movie slate.

5.  Atmosphere and mood- the director knows whats he's doing here, and ill leave it at that.

Not so good

1.  Pace of the movie is choppy.  Film starts off building a noticeable uphill, sustained tension and intrigue until about halfway thru the movie at which point I felt the movie flat lined until the final 20 mins or so- dunno maybe it was just me.

2.  30 mins too long filled with too many drawn out flashback/ illusionary scenes.  Dont get me wrong, I enjoyed the numerous flashback scenes but felt they were all too long and drawn out.

3.  From above point, too many flashbacks.

A lot more positives than negatives, and I was captivated the entire time, even thru the slow middle, but the film seemed to be missing the oommphh that the Departed, Goodfellas, Taxi Driver, etc had.",1276041600,,1866,4.4147058823529415

The latest outing by the incomparable Scorcese is this woooooooooooooooooonderful mind-play, multi-layered film with Leonardi DiCaprio playing the ""rat in a maze"" to perfection.

The simple plot revolves around a federal investigator who is sent to this insane asylum to investigate the disappearance of one of the patients. As it turns out, this is the ONLY simple thing about the film.

This is an intriguing, thought-provoking, visually captivating tapestry that explores the recesses of the mind in an intensely driven psychological torture chamber the likes I haven't seen since ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?"".

Looking at this also brings to mind the aaaaaaaaaaawwwwwwwwwwesome acting chops of Leonardi DiCaprio.  Here he is off the chain as the federal investigator whose life is crumbling all around him and his performance here evokes memories of the positively flawless performance he gave in ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape?.""

3606314,5,B001GCUO5M,"Sometimes, schlock borders on art.  In the hands of Martin Scorsese, it not only becomes art--it becomes a whole new kind of art entirely.  SHUTTER ISLAND is equal parts thriller, noir, mystery, and horror, a darkly humorous and atmospheric film filled some outstanding acting and truly stunning visuals.

The film revolves around a very simple premise: U.S. Marshal Teddy Daniels (DiCaprio) and his partner (Ruffalo) are going to Ashecliffe Island on Shutter Island, outside Boston, to look for a missing inmate.  She hasn't escaped: she's on the island somewhere.  But where?  And what exactly goes on at Ashecliffe, what mysterious activities have really drawn Daniels there?  And the ultimate question: will he escape with his sanity?

The film is very closely based on Dennis Lehane's spectacular novel, with a few minor twists (and one not-so-minor twist near the end).  DiCaprio is a wonder in the lead role; he has really grown into his own as an actor, and this film gives him a breadth of range he hasn't yet seen before.  As for the rest of the principle cast: Ruffalo is in traditionally fine form; it's nice to see Ben Kingsly actually acting again (as opposed to just treading water in a bunch of slop); Michelle Williams is amazing as Daniels's deceased wife (viewed in flashbacks/hallucinations); Max von Sydow is chilling (if underused); Emily Mortimer turns in a haunting performance in her limited role; John Carroll Lynch doesn't have much to do, but does it well; and Jackie Earl Healey, in his small role, is fantastic.

The level of the performances, and the solid script by Laeta Kalogridis, aside, the reason to view this film--repeatedly--is for Scorsese's atmospheric directing.  Remember CAPE FEAR, his slight misfire of a horror film (though still far better than most horror films of the 90s)?  SHUTTER ISLAND doesn't misfire, not once.  And it's filled with some absolutely stellar visual shots, scenes and imagery that borders on performance art.  Haunting in its breadth and emotional resonance, SHUTTER ISLAND ranks among Scorsese's best.  Watch it to see what a noir/horror film should be.",1275868800,3,2124,5.095375722543353
3606315,5,B001GCUO5M,"This eerie neo-noir, mystery, madness movie reminds me a bit of Scorsese's other foray into madness, ""Taxi Driver."" but the hallucinatory nature of Shutter Island is cinematically more interesting to me, although the DeNiro character may be slightly more powerful than DiCaprio.

Having worked for the Massachusetts Department of Mental Health as a psychologist in the 1970's, the authenticity of the settings is amazing (not surprising in that some of it was filmed at Medfield State Hospital where I worked). The brick exteriors and the institutional green interiors brought back some unsettling memories. Although this transpired in a more gloomy period of  psychiatric history in the early 50's, where lobotomies were still in fashion and the applications of ECT (aka shock therapy) was almost equally as gruesome.

The delusional world of Teddy Daniels  was quite convincing, and extremely well done. The concentration camp sequences, the visions of his wife, the psychiatrist in the cave- psychiatry was very primitive then gave an excellent representation of full blown paranoid schizophrenic. And DiCaprio pulled off this arduous scenario very well. Ben Kingsley was also well cast as the psychiatrist/superintendent, with his aristocratic airs and the pictures of the more grizzly bygone days of psychiatric torture adorning (e. g.screws in the head to let the demons out) his sumptuous abode. Seeing one of the finest actors of all time, Max Van Sydow, of Ingmar Bergman film's fame,as Kingsley's colleague was a real treat.

However, the idea that DiCaprio's law enforcement ordeals where part a vast psychotic psychodrama, initiated by Kingsley, seemed a bit nutty, and pushed the idea that cinema to be effective to the audience requires a ""suspension of disbelief"" to the limit. Nevertheless the mystery and suspense was excellent, and Scorsese came of looking like Bergman, orchestrating masterful shifts between fantasy and reality. Sure Martin overdid it a bit, on one hand, by having Shutter Island resemble a semi-gothic Alcatraz,and, on the other, having Shutter Island seem not nearly as scary on the inside as Bridgewater State hospital, the Massachusetts hospital for the criminally insane, memorialized in Joseph Wiseman's classic, and gruesome, documentary, ""Titticut Follies."" To reach that level would have required a character like Anthony Hopkins' chilling characterization as Hannibal Lecter in The Silence of the Lambs, the gold standard of the criminally insane leading man. The criminally insane patients who, for the most part, seemed remarkably subdued, a symptom of the then new, chemical straight jacket, Thorazine.

Anyway I think the official Amazon reviewer who saw this as one of Scorsese's lesser works is crazy, or at least needs to get his head examined. I think this ranks up with ""Taxi Driver"" as one of Martin's finest movies. Also, I thought its portrayal of the Bostonian mindset was way better than in The Departed,"" in which DiCaprio was excellent but, as usual- like in last year's ""Revolution Road,"" not fully appreciated. He won an Oscar as a young, developmentally challenged character, in the second rate ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape,"" However, he will surely be passed over here because a ""madman, who's frightening behavior,won't appeal to the pseudo liberal, PC, tastes (""Hurt Locker,"""" Milk"") of the Academy Award's self congratulatory, aesthetically challenged, voters. Maybe my somewhat scattered  review is a bit delusional as well, like one the guard's said: ""madness"" is contagious in the madnouses, and I certainly did my time as a member of a front line treatment team in my own Shutter Island.",1275782400,8,3661,5.367595818815331

But, at second sight, the movie is a merciless metaphor that emblematizes the dark years after the WW2. it's not a mere coincidence the arouse of the Noir genre began precisely since 1946, in which the ghosts, phantoms and dragons nestled during these oppressing years got out from the Pandora' box. The dark experiments about genetics well known during the Nazi Germany (Do you remember QB VII from Leon Uris ?) didn't come at end when the War was over. Furthermore, these cruel exercises of experimentation continued with or without the total consent of many regimes around the world. Brainwashes, hypnosis, subliminal messages, induced behavior patterns intermingled with many needs of an emerging market that desperately needed to blossom -if you may- as cathartic device in order to forget the horrid memories of a recent past.

Dark films like Stalag 17, Shock corridor,  Psycho,Invasion of the body snatchers, Them, The man with the golden arm, Bitter victory, Catch 22, The planet of the apes, The island of Dr. Moreau, Dementia 13 or THX 1138, were part of many films that explored and felt the necessity to express the dark side of the moon as product of a brave new world that now had to deal with the consequences of the nuclear issues, radioactive residues, contamination and pollution. But there was something more in the air, the political environment (the well known witch's hunt undertaken by then), was also at its most algid moment. Spies everywhere plus the tensions derived from the Cold War were motives far enough to forge a social corpus in which the insanity and the spiritual wounds made to blossom the birth of the rock, the cool jazz and the new rebel kids of the Literature as Alan Gingsberg, Jack Kerouac or Camus, Sartre, Andric, Hamsun on the other side of the Atlantic.

These reflections are present and suggested in the film, through audacious metaphors and apparently coincidental facts.

Kingsley as always steals the show (He is one of the ten greatest actors in the world); Max von Sydow is superb too in his brief cameo, Mark Ruffalo plays a sensitive but crucial role and Di Caprio exhibits punch and talent.

A worthy to watch film.",1274227200,3,2290,4.861538461538461
3606334,5,B001GCUO5M,"I am not a fan of Scorsese or DiCaprio, that is not to say that I do not appreciate that they are skilled in their trade, just that I wouldn't get a movie just because it was directed by Scorsese.

I got this movie because of the trailer which I watched on another DVD. It looked compelling.

The film is so exquisitely crafted that after it ends, you continue to think about it and are tempted to watch it again to confirm something you may have missed or wasn't so sure about. If you've seen Secret Window, this is something like that, except better. And that is saying alot because I enjoyed Secret Window immensely.

DiCaprio, as mentioned by another reviewer was great in this movie, he was thoroughly believable. And Ben Kingsley was exceptional, as usual. Dark in this movie - one wouldn't believe he 'was' Ghandi once.

I still haven't made up my mind what happened, and am likely to be watching it again shortly to work out what was real and what was imagined. Somehow I feel there should be a sequel.

If you enjoy psychological Thrillers, I would highly recommend this movie. This is one which is a definite must-get.",1273968000,5,1128,4.509803921568627
3606335,1,B001GCUO5M,"This isn't a very good movie in my opinion.  It doesn't go anywhere and after awhile you figured out whats going on and once that is done, then all you doing is watching the movie to see if you were right.  I am hugely disappointed because I like Leo's movies and Martin Scorsece's movies and yet this didn't work at all.  The movie is just moody and what I mean about that is that I think it tries to hard to be some type of film noir.  DiCarpio's performance will drive you nuts, the dialog, the accents are just bad.  Mark Ruffalo doesn't seem to have anything to do and it reminds me a lof of Eyes Wide Shut.  In fact I call it Scorsece's Eyes Wide Shut.  Now I am not telling you not to see it, but this is a rental only.  You sit through the whole thing and when it's over you will say to yourself, ""What in the world did I just watched!""  I said it, my date said it and the rest of the people coming out of the theater said it.  Everyone and I do mean, EVERYONE I know, was disappointed in this movie and we all really really wanted to like it.  Some people say you have to have an open mind and that it is more deep.  But when you peel back the layers, you have nothing.  The previews make you think its a supernatural thriller... just skip it.

3606337,4,B001GCUO5M,"I have said this before and I will say it again. If it wasn't for Kevin Costner, 'Goodfellas' would have recieved the best picture honor in 1990. Martin Scorcese for the past 20 years has given us some of the most meorable movies of our generation. They have a very similar theme and tend to use the same actors as well. Now, we are given 'Shutter Island', which is a step away from the usual and giving us something fresh.

I had no idea that this film was based on a comic book, but seeing the trailers and knowing how well DiCaprio works with Scorcese I was very eagar to see how this movie turned out. The movie was a good watch, but there were a few flaws to it. Still, I don't want to rip this film because this was a brave move by Scorcese. He decided to break the usual mafia mold and give us a psychological thriller. We do have the Scorcese elements such as the large amount of 'F' bombs and the whole 1950s/1960s gangster/detective vibe which he loves to do. Still, The acting was great, especially in the every end when the truth about Shutter Island was revield. DiCaprio's performace throughout the movie was good, but bland at times until the very end. His character took a huge twist and the dramatic turn her took was just incredible it made up for the last hour and a half. The movie I felt was too predictable. I pretty much figured out what was going on about half way into the movie. As a whole package it was definitely something new from a director who's work I enjoy.

My thoughts on 'Shutter Island', take the time to see it. It was a new step in Martin Scorcese's career I would love to see if he intends to continue trying new genres of film. While predictable it is still enjoyable.",1273363200,,1710,4.307453416149069

Regardless of how predictable I found the film, it didn't at all take away from the enjoyment.  DiCaprio gives a wonderful performance as US Marshall Teddy Daniels.

3606341,4,B001GCUO5M,"Scorsese,freed now from the Oscar-chase,revels in the tool-box of cinema styles and genres. He is a magician of film-making. He loves film and can quote from film-noir of the 40s and 50s. This is a B-movie with A-listed actors,production design,effects and cinematography,adapted from a Denis Lehane novel. This is not the Scorsese of great films like Taxi Driver,Mean Streets,Raging Bull,Goodfellas,King of Comedy,no, this is the Scorsese of `entertainments'.We know,before seeing the film, he's paying homage to Hitchcock(Vertigo),Tourneur(Out of the Past),Fuller(Shock Corridor),Preminger(Laura).Themes of the 40s and 50s were of post-war trauma,cold war paranoia, McCarthyism,mind control,the abuses of psychiatry,Nazism,neo-noir,madness vs.sanity. We have elements of the Haunted House of horror in the lead in and the build up,with the boat chugging through the fog and Penderecki's fog-horn quavers as Teddy Daniels(DiCaprio) throws up,telling himself to ""pull yourself together"".This being a call to sanity in a realm where people may lose their mind. Teddy and his partner Chuck Aule(Ruffalo),US Marshalls, must negotiate an isolated asylum,Ashecliffe Hospital for the criminally insane,where identities shift,and the greatest threat comes from what cannot be seen. They are searching for Rachel Solando,a patient who murdered her children,and mysteriously went missing. As in film-noir,the character of Teddy comes with baggage. Daniels is tormented by migraines,by dreams of his dead wife,Dolores(Williams) and by memories of the liberation of Dachau. The subtext is more important than the main subject. Each scene is densely packed with visual significance. Daniels tells Aule he requested this mission to find a patient named Andrew Laeddis,an arsonist he believes killed Dolores. He also believes that Ashecliffe is conducting secret experiments on its patients and he intends to tell the truth. Daniels,searching for Aule,finds a woman hiding in a cave,who says she is the real Rachel Solando,a psychiatrist imprisoned for questioning the hospital's practises. He's told in Ward C Lauddis is in the Lighthouse. What goes on there?

Does the film work? No. How do we know the narrative's real events are not themselves dreamed?Are rats pouring over a cliffside a gothic folly(a mental figment)or real?As Daniel's hallucinations take over and push the movie off balance from a necessary baseline of reality and the forward momentum is lost in the many one-to-one explanations that Teddy receives. The sudden shift into psychodrama undermines the thriller framework. Daniels is also infused by psychotropic drugs. Can we trust our senses in this shuttered world?Scorsese is the arch manipulator of the fragments Teddy must shore against his ruin: a study of madness in which the protagonist conflates the evil he has been exposed to with his own crimes and associated guilt. Out of this dark labyrinth and creep-show shocker looms a world of H-bombs and Nazi-styled surgical experiments and brain-washing. As Noyce tells Teddy:""This is a game. All this is for you...If you don't let it go,you'll never leave this island"".The acting cameos are superb,Kingsley,Von Sydow,Mortimer,Clarkson,Haley,Lynch,Williams.

3606363,2,B001GCUO5M,"I have not read the book and hence will only review the content based on the movie.

It's a show where the plot tried to cover too many topics at a time, and its not sure of its central topic. Mainly it tried to let the audience imagined that the plot was related to Supernatural, Psychotic and/or Mind Control conspiracy in the post war era. It tried to slot in reminder of the Nazi's death camp too.

I won't dwell on the content of the show. But credit must be give for the director who tried hard to impress onto the audience that our identity is strongly reinforced and affected by those around us. Thus, the perception surroundings can easily cause one to shift his/her perceived own identity.

The show fail miserably as it ended without a proper ending. This is unexpected of a big-budget production. Regardless of the director's intention on having an open-ended conclusion, the way the movie ended, made it appeared like during production, it has ran out of budget!

Therefore I will give it only a 2 stars. Its not because the theme was confusing or that the director did not deserve credit on highlighting external perceptions can strongly shape how a person view their own identity. But the fact that a movie ended with an inconclusive ending, tells no story at all.

If there's a certain saving grace with the ending, it's the fact that you can watch this movie again and again and walk through the most probably ""What Ifs"". Either Marshal Teddy Daniels was right or Dr. John Cawley is correct.

And while I'm not the biggest Leonardo DiCaprio fan, I still consider him a good, serious actor.  And when I viewed the film, I was taken aback by Scorcese's cool visuals accompanied by a ridiculous score, which Scorcese and musician Robbie Robertson attempted to pull a ""Tarantino"" by mixing various style scores/compositions into scenes.  Unlike Quentin Tarantino's talent at this style, I found Scorcese and Robertson's picks to be completely out of place.  Whereas Tarantino scrounges every possible genre of music, this selection was still limited to music that had that cheesy 1950s horror film feel to it.  And I get why the filmmakers chose this music since the film does take place in 1954. However, the music becomes more of a distraction rather than a seamless, blending, artful, expressionistic character for filmmaking - the effect that any score should have on a film.

All music aside, the film was good. The ending in no way lived up to the ""twist-you'll-never-see-coming"" status it was given by most movie critics and audiences, but it still was worthy of any mystery fan's money.  The acting is all spot-on with a great cast including Mark Ruffalo, Ben Kingsley, Michelle Williams, Max von Sydow, Jackie Earle Haley, Patricia Clarkson, Emily Mortimer, Ted Levine, John Carroll Lynch, and Elias Koteas.  All of them great actors with very pivotal parts, yet, in my opinion, sadly, not used enough in the film. DiCaprio acts well enough but there is something slightly missing from this film, preventing it from being one of the year's best.

I wish I could put my finger on what exactly is missing, but it's difficult to identify.  Scorcese pulls out all the stops and the filmmaking is sufficient, however, the story itself on celluloid is too outlandish and too pretentious.  The ending was open to interpretation but that's not what put me off - in fact, I liked the ending.  What put a bad taste in my mouth was the lack of explanation into how the entire surprising twist of a plotline could have been executed in the first place. For the sake of surprising the audience at the end, the filmmakers don't show or explain how our protagonist is placed in the position at the beginning other than simply alluding to a fact that the audience has to assume.  This may not sound like much to make the movie ""so-so"" but it is a big deal in terms of the story's progression, and should be treated as such. Also, being a father, I wasn't too crazy about the flashback scene involving kids.

Nevertheless, ""Shutter Island"" does take a Hitchcockian twist and turns out a decent story. I am a fan of the novel's author, Dennis Lehane, because his stories are so cinematic and I love his attempt to mix film noir mystery with a period piece. And there are some movies based on books that although not as great as their literary companion are still great adaptations and worth watching (i.e.,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Battle-Royale-Director-s-Cut-Collector-s-Edition/dp/B000F4LPJ6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Battle Royale: Director's Cut (Collector's Edition)</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Watchmen-The-Ultimate-Cut-Blu-ray/dp/B002IYEQR4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Watchmen: The Ultimate Cut [Blu-ray</a>],&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kick-Ass/dp/0785134352/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kick-Ass</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/High-Fidelity/dp/B002CLBJV4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">High Fidelity</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Let-the-Right-One-In-Blu-ray/dp/B001MYIXAW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Let the Right One In [Blu-ray</a>]). However, this film unfortunately doesn't quite make that cut. If you've read the book, the movie will be somewhat of a disappointment only because the book (when it first came out and I read it) was so surprising and great. But, maybe that's the rub; if you read the book, there's almost no need to see this film 'cause most of the book was put on screen.  The movie's ""Good"" status -- rather than ""Great"" -- is not because of the acting or directing, which are both satisfactory - it's simply the adaptation.  Acting and directing: satisfactory; story structure: mediocre.

Scorcese has always had an artistic take on film and moviemaking, whether he's shooting the grimy, grainy black-and-white world of a boxing ring, or the flashy, colorful casinos of the Vegas mob. He's an icon in the truest sense of the word. His take on Dennis Lehane's 1950s-set thriller is a new territory for him and he shoots it well. The story is a must for any noir mystery thriller fiction fan, but viewing the movie should only come after experiencing the ultimate ""director's cut"" -- the book.",1271980800,2,5314,5.954068241469816
3606365,3,B001GCUO5M,"Contains spoilers.

'Shutter Island' begins with a very interesting start and I went into it ""clean"", having avoided all the publicity and reviews. I really had no idea what it was about, or who was even in it (other than Di Caprio). The basic setup is handled very well and is fairly snappy, getting to the point quickly. In short, we're presented with the two feds (previously unaquainted) on a ferry to the asylum to investigate the bizarre disappearance of a female inmate. The presentation is superb and it all feels very ""noir"".

However, around the hour mark after the feds have been on the island for a little bit, the film tends to trail off somewhat. That's not to say it gets boring, it doesn't, but I certainly felt my interest going. One of the main reasons for this is the fact that the punchline is rather obvious and anyone watching the film will come to the same conclusion that presents itself at the end. In addition, the investigation is so outlandish and Di Caprio's character seems like a tourtured individual from the outset, that it becomes difficult not to see this train coming from a long way away. Something is obviously wrong in the world of 'Shutter Island' as well as Teddy Daniels and putting 2 and 2 together ain't that hard. Any fan of the 'Twilight Zone', or stories of that ilk will have the ""twist"" sussed out in a flash. Which, is extremely unfortunate for the film as a whole.

Apart from that, it's generally handled in a competent manner. But I feel that Scorsese has pulled back from his form of old and is content to go by-the-numbers too often these days. As far as I am concerned he still hasn't made a ""great"" film since 'Goodfellas', which is very difficult to top I admit.

On a side note, I find it extremely hard to watch anything with Di Caprio in it. He's one of the most overrated actors working at the moment. He's quite hammy in this at times, or maybe it's the fact that the other actors around him show him up for what he is. Although, in fairness he has the hardest part to play. There's great support from Mark Ruffalo, Ben Kingsley, Max von Sydow and everone else concerned, but the story itself is the film's greatest letdown...

...and on the whole it's just not as smart as it thinks it is.",1271635200,5,2253,4.472019464720194
3606366,5,B001GCUO5M,"Like many people who follow upcoming movies fairly intensely, I had the ending to Martin Scorsese's newest spoiled for me months ago.  Don't worry dear reader, I'm going to try my hardest not to do the same to you.  But I'm not sure that it mattered so much, really, for me - I think I would have guessed that SOMETHING funny was going on pretty quickly.  It's a film that builds slowly and steadily towards the final revelation, piling on clues in almost every scene - some are quite subtle, some I think would be picked up on even by viewers not so sharp-eyed, by viewers who haven't seen as many films as I have.  To the film's credit, though, I think even people following pretty closely probably won't figure out precisely what is strange about, or wrong with Teddy and his partner Chuck, though most ought to know that something is pretty rotten in the state of Denmark before the halfway point.

Well just who are Teddy and Chuck then?  Teddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Chuck Aule (Mark Ruffalo) are a couple of US Marshalls come to investigate an escaped prisoner at Shutter Island, a facility for the criminally insane and dangerous in Boston Harbor, in 1954.  Apparently a woman, Rachel Solando, who was committed for having drowned her three children, has escaped from a locked room and cannot be found anywhere - though the island is walled by sheer cliffs except in a small beach area where the pier stands, and the weather is so inhospitable that no one could have gotten off to the mainland.  Something's not right though, and as Teddy and Chuck try to figure out what happened to Rachel they begin to wonder just what the doctors, led by Dr. John Cawley (Ben Kingsley) are doing with the patients - and Teddy starts to experience nightmares and flashbacks to his own experiences in World War II, which seem to mirror some of the feelings he's having, and perhaps even the events that are occuring in the present day.

To say too much more about the film risks revealing too much; suffice it to say that for me this was a beautifully put together psychological thriller and puzzler, and that far from being an example of the director in ""mainstream"" mode as some critics have asserted - selling out and dumbing himself down - it's in fact a tribute to the glossy studio filmmaking of old as much as it is a contemporary work.  The whole film has an aura of uber-reality or just classic ""Hollywood studio"" reality that fit both the noirish setting and the increasing psychological fantasy angle.  Notice how the sky in most shots looks a little odd - a little digitally altered I think.  Various elements of the landscape often seem to stand out more harshly than they should - or, occasionally, they look softer.  When Teddy's in the cave and the camera looks out it appears completely fake and set-like to me; when he's in the jeep with the warden it's done with rear-projection, or it beautifully mimics the process; the effect is much like that in a Hitchcock film from the mid 50s - THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO MUCH or VERTIGO.  The blood in the fantasy scenes, in particular that of the Nazi commandant, is overly rich and bright - the phonograph too looks really burnished and bright like old Technicolor.  SHUTTER ISLAND for any flaws it might have as a narrative, is one of the most beautifully shot and lit films I've seen in a long time, with impeccable art direction and production design.

About the narrative, again - without revealing too much, I will say that the revelation, when it comes, is a little too tidy, a little too wrapped-up-nice I think, given the wild fantastic moods that the film has developed up until this point.  And for me that was a bit of a problem - I think it could have stood a more ""open"" ending, and I think many will agree that it's just a bit too talky, a bit too much of the ""now, this is why this happened and what it REALLY meant"".  But at the same time - this isn't David Lynch, though at times there's a faint Lynchian surrealism at work.  This is Scorsese channelling Hitchcock at times, and perhaps Samuel Fuller (whose film SHOCK CORRIDOR is also set in an institution for the criminally insane), and his late friend Michael Powell, whose color films of the 40s had a similar glossiness and artificiality, a heightened or altered reality that wasn't quite fantasy but wasn't everyday either.  I was also reminded, interestingly enough, of Alex Proyas' film DARK CITY which is another film with a very hermetic, closed-in and noirish pulpy atmosphere (SHUTTER ISLAND takes place entirely on the island save for a couple of flashbacks, just as DARK CITY never leaves the eponymous city, and involves a hero with a possibly faulty memory).

The use of music recalls other films as well - most of it is rather scary late 20th century classical work by composers like Scelsi, Cage and Ligeti, with a significant role played by the earlier Mahler Piano Quintet.  This isn't the world of the film noir or old Hollywood, more likely something out of a Stanley Kubrick film, and there are some moments where SHUTTER ISLAND seems ready to ascend to the heights of 2001 or THE SHINING.  I'm not trying to suggest that Scorsese is aping or copying all of these other great filmmakers - merely that he is building on their foundations, and giving cineastes like me an extra level of fun; and I don't think the film requires any great cinematic knowledge to succeed, either.  If he doesn't quite, in my opinion, reach the level of some of these great masterpieces, it's probably because the narrative at the end can't really break its bounds and reach for the stars - or for the madness - that it seems to be heading towards.  But darn, it's a fun ride.

The cast is excellent, particularly I think Ruffalo in a subtle and very demanding role that has to reveal itself very, very slowly; but for the most part this is Scorsese's show and that of his behind-the-camera people including screenwriter Laeta Kalogridis (adapting a Dennis Lehane novel), music supervisor Robbie Robertson, his usual editor Thelma Schoonmaker, and perhaps especially cinematographer Robert Richardson.  SHUTTER ISLAND creates an environment of dread and unease, a just-not-quite real world that will bear many repeated viewings even though the secret is known and the story unravelled.",1271462400,3,6313,4.679313459801265

3606368,5,B001GCUO5M,"It is in many ways a great film. It questions the ""heritage"" of the Second World War and the horror the American soldiers discovered in the camps, in this case here Dachau. It is also more than clear on the passage of some of the researchers of Nazi Germany to the US to continue their research in peace, including if necessary with human experiments when dealing with medical research. It is unluckily well-known that prisons and orphanages were places of hellish torturing and violence in the name of research or reform. That's the first level of the film. The second level is: what can society do with the few human beings who are so bad that they can't be reformed? Various solutions are available: lobotomizing them to turn them into docile pets, pharmaceuticalizing their cases so that they become chemical zombies, or manipulating their minds to make them convinced of what they have done and of the necessary punishment called treatment they are receiving. The film goes even as far as imagining the production of human killing tools that could be used in wars. Surgery, drugs or mental manipulation, that's the choices envisaged here. The three of them are all just fully wrong. But the film is a lot more disquieting than that if we deal with the simple fact that the decision of a psychiatrist to classify you as anything psychic or psychological is absolutely irreversible and everything you may say or do to prove you are not will be turned into the evidence that you are and will be used against you. In other words the lady always protests too much. That's the Kafka aspect of the tale. But the film is even better than all that because Scorsese in his personal style builds a story in which we do not know at all at the end if the two cops were really what they pretended to be at the beginning and thus were kidnapped by the doctors to make sure nothing will seep out of their concentration camp, or if it is the doctors who are right at the end and that the two cops are what these doctors pretend, one is a killer and the other his doctor and that the whole tale was a medical procedure to reach treatment. At the end there is only one choice left: to live as a monster or to die in dignity. But what is dignity in such an environment? We are happily doubting everything at the end, which may create a feeling of frustration in the audience.

There are a lot of compelling reasons for this theory, but most are missing one thing.  In the movie it is stated that the project at the island might be to make unfeeling sleeper soldiers.  Someone saw Teddy, with his troubled background, (somewhat obsessed with the killer of his wife, a guilt-wracked soldier from WWII) as a perfect candidate fit for the ""job"".  Thus the drugging and psychological brainwashing to make him think he is the insane Andrew.  The verdict on his ""healing"" (brainwashing) came out negative.  They couldn't break him.  He would not be a sleeper.  That is why he said the last line.  He would rather die a good person (lobotomized or whatever -- for sure never leaving the island) than live as a monster, meaning an unfeeling killing machine for the military.

Those who like the film are speaking of the way the film messes with your sense of reality but then so do films like Kubrick's The Shining and just about everything else in the psychological suspense/horror genre.

This is psychological suspense amped up with a good dose of gothic horror. Scorsese is certainly bending genres here, but the content is pretty typical of those genres that he borrows from--good v. evil, trauma induced identity crisis, alternate realities as coping mechanisms for the horrors of the real one.

I'll admit that the film does some masterful (CGI enhanced) things to create mood & atmosphere but I think most film fans want something more than a thrill ride from this filmmaker.",1269734400,,934,4.89873417721519
3606371,5,B001GCUO5M,"WOW!--in caps!
This was an excellent movie--a Martin Scorsese picture.  I call it a psychological thriller because it really messes with your head.  Through the whole movie, I didn't know what was real and what was imaginatory.  It had me hooked. I was engrossed in the story from the very beginning right through to the end, and the time passed so fast.

Our story begins in Boston Harbor Islands, 1954.  Ted/Teddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a U.S. Federal Marshall traveling on a small boat with his head in the commode, barfing away from motion sickness.  (Don't worry.  You don't see anything.)  Charlie/Chuck is another Marshall traveling with him--calls Ted ""Boss"".  They are enroute to Shutter Island, a one-of-a kind Federal psychiatric treatment and housing facility for the severely criminally insane.  Of course, this is a high-security facility, surrounded by an electric perimeter and police or guards (not sure which, but will call them ""guards"" here), and is on an island with high, rocky cliffs.  The only way in or out is via ferry, and the ferry is controlled by the federal facility.

As Teddy and Chuck's ferry docks at the Shutter Island pier, they are met by guards and transported to and inside the facility perimeter.  The outside grounds are beautiful!--pretty as an English mansion.  Some of the ""guests"" are manning the grounds as the guards explain to Teddy and Chuck that buildings A and B house the better adjusted guests while building C is for the most dangerous ones.  These are the incurables.  Building C is an old fort.

We soon meet the primary doctor, played by Ben Kingsley.  He explains basically that the concept of the hospital is to provide treatment for the severely criminally insane who are beyond help at other facilities.  If the hospital cannot help the guests, they claim to at least try to provide a means of comfort for the guests to live in.  We also soon meet Max VonSydow (Needful Things, Buck Rogers, Three Days of the Condor, and many other movies) as another doctor and primary member of the hospital staff.

Teddy and Chuck were sent to investigate the disappearance of a guest, Rachel Solondo.  Rachel drowned her three children in the lake but believes they are still alive.  She also believes the facility is actually her home in the Berkshires and the others are all attendants, so it is unlikely that she would try to leave, besides--there is no way to get out and no where to go if she did.

Teddy also has his own demons to deal with.  He was one of the WWII soldiers who got to bust up the Krakow concentration camp at the end of the war.  Seeing the piles of dead bodies (men, women, and children) and the living victims of the camp left him with nightmares and flashbacks.  In addition, he is tormented by the memories of his pretty wife dying in a fire caused by an arsonist.  In the midst of his investigation and a raging hurricane, he becomes convinced that this facility is a house of medical experimentation in the use of psychotropic drugs, brain surgery, and barbaric torture.  Although he is told to ""RUN,"" he is determined to find out the truth.

As I said before, this is a ""WOW"" movie.  It kept my mind completely engaged throughout the entire movie.  DiCaprio did a fantastic job in his role and you really could not second guess what would happen next.  Even though I know what happens, I would watch it again in a heartbeat.

Note that I do NOT suggest this movie for your children.  ADULTS ONLY is my strong recommendation--as in age 18 or older.  I believe the concepts are too harsh for a developing mind. So please, watch it first by yourself--then decide.",1269648000,4,3648,4.698738170347003

It hit me about midway through the movie that there were two possible endings to this film. One, the story is as it is told from the outset - he's a detective that has uncovered some horrible Nazi-like mind experiments of mental patients on Shutter Island; or two, he himself is crazy, and this is all just an elaborate story he has created in his mind. I was happy with the ending we got, but I thought it would have been a nice twist at the end to leave it sort of unknown whether he was really crazy or whether they had simply succeeded in convincing him that he's crazy, and Shutter Island really is a place that carries out these horrible experiments.

The story itself is good though a bit slow moving for a thriller of this type, and not entirely original. For those that have seen ""Identity"" (2003) or ""Memento"" (2000) this movie treads on similar ground, especially similar to ""Identity"" where the ""hero"" of that film actually turns out to be a killer with multiple personalities. However, this film brings a certain philosophical debate to the idea of being ""crazy"" that the other aforementioned films did not. As DiCaprio's character says at the end of the film ""is it better to an alive murderer or a dead hero?""",1269648000,,1247,4.5874439461883405

""We are duly appointed Federal Marshals."" Reading it in plain text may not sound that cool, but try saying it out-loud with a Boston accent and a rough attitude. Leonardo DiCaprio does in Shutter Island, and it sounds wicked-awesome!

DiCaprio plays Federal Marshal Teddy Daniels. His sidekick of a partner is Chuck Aule (Mark Ruffalo), and they are sent to the mysterious `Shutter Island' to investigate the disappearance of a woman.

After she drowned her three children in the lake behind her house, Rachel (Emily Mortimer) was sent to this eerie island. It's an insane asylum for the kind of insane people that we love the most in dark and gritty films similar to this; the criminal kind. When she miraculously escapes from her cell, with a barred window and a sealed door locked from the outside; it's up to Teddy and Chuck to track her down. With a horrific storm on the horizon, they don't have much time and chances don't look too bright that she will survive. As if matters aren't bad enough on their own, Teddy is suffering from severe post traumatic stress from his involvement in World War II.

The island is very much a huge character in the film. It's comparable to the islands of Deep Rising, King Kong and The Lost World: Jurassic Park. Shutter Island's legendary director, Martin Scorsese, brilliantly introduces the island to us early on in the film. It's massive in size and lurks in its murky waters, surrounded by a heavy thick `turn back now!' fog. It's introduced to us via creepy boat ride and is accompanied by a daunting score, every bit as chilling as those of The Shining and Jaws.

As he has for years, Scorsese knows exactly what he's doing with the camera. He captures chilling images that pay homage to Stanley Kubrick and Alfred Hitchcock.

The film constantly gets under your skin and makes you repeatedly ask yourself, ""What the hell is going on?"" It's not hard to follow; it's just bizarre and unsettling. It's no secret that weird things start happening; even if you haven't seen the trailer, you are almost suffocated with this constant vibe from the first scene to the last.

The ending is the pay-off. I'm not going to say that the movie is too long, or that it's boring, because it's not in the least. But it is long and you are literally drained by the end of it. It just takes so much out of you. You're left with island fever I guess, and Scorsese has ensured that his island has bogged you down, along with his characters.

The film takes us back to the 50s which is always a blast. It's creepy and disturbing but not over the top with the gore. It's cleverly written and I'm sure the novel of which it's based, has sent one or two of its readers to the Looney-bin. It's a fun ride and while it embodies several different elements we've seen a thousand times before (eerie island, insane asylum, post World War II, where'd the girl go? etc.); it boils all of them in a pot together, creating something very unique indeed. The film will surely only get better and better with repeated viewings.

The acting is superb, and now that I think about it, the film is also resembles a videogame; Resident Evil, Tomb Raider and Silent Hill come to mind. There are several powerful characters that Teddy visits on his journey, that give him advice or a piece to his puzzle. Ben Kingsley is terrific as the doctor. Mark Ruffalo is very much like a videogame sidekick and you believe he'd do anything at all for Teddy. And Jackie Earle Haley and Elias Koteas play a couple of the island's mentally tormented misfits, astonishingly well. Jackie Earle Haley can be jotted down as a candidate for an Academy Award in the supporting actor category; a flawless performance.

Having worked together on Gangs of New York, Aviator, The Departed and now Shutter Island; it's clear that DiCaprio and Scorsese know exactly what they will get from one another. It's pure movie magic as far as I'm concerned; they make one of the best Hollywood duos out there.

Here's the first of the potential Oscar candidates for 2010.",1269475200,2,4516,4.741071428571429

The so-called twist was telegraphed at the very beginning of the movie, which is OK, cos at least it made some sense. Much rather have a little predictability than some totally outlandish ending that is not supported by anything you have been shown.

The general premise of this film is not too interesting unfortunately. Mental illness, illusions, effects of past trauma. Not very engaging. You do keep watching though cos you wanna pat your own back that your hunch in the beginning was correct, even though you hope it wasn't.

The ending is not satisfying at all. Overall not an uplifting experience.

3606377,4,B001GCUO5M,"Given the insanely talented cast and crew that assembled this film, one would certainly expect a lot going in. Shutter Island delivers in fine fashion, thanks to the great screenplay and the performance of Leonardo DiCaprio.

Shutter Island stops just short of greatness, in my opinion, because of a lack of subtlety and nuance on the part of Scorsese. As a veteran director, and likely the best one living today, he undoubtedly had his way with how this entire film played out. On a positive note, there was little wasted time. Those reviewers who claim the film to be a bore were obviously attending the wrong film - Shutter Island is far from that. But Scorsese makes two errors. First, he assumes that bombastic, overbearing musical interludes and occasional dialogue attempting to inject humor into the film are tantamount to the noir quality that classic phychological thrillers typically have. That type of subtle ingenuity was what made the film ""Memento"" so great. For those of you who have not seen it, Memento is widely considered the greatest psychological thriller ever filmed. By comparison, Shutter Island is a very loud film with endless spoken dialogue, and a huge Hollywood star around every turn, even in bit roles. Films like Shawshank Redemption and The Sixth Sense work so well because of the subtlety of the characters, and therefore the ""twists"" are more effective in making the viewer take a step back and think rather than go for shock value. (The scene at the end of the film with DiCaprio and his wife at the lake was one of the more overwrought scenes I have ever seen).

Having said that, this is easily in the top 5 films of the past year, and certainly DiCaprio's best performance. Without him, the film would not have had the sincerity and integrity to pull it over the line. But DiCaprio proves he can carry more than his share of the weight, and the rest of the cast (VonSydow in particular) makes sure his performance is not in vain. If not for the ego of Scorsese (and I realize he has the right to a huge ego, but films like this can have absolutely NONE), this could have been the greatest psychological thriller ever filmed. When a film relies so much on atmosphere and character development (and there is enough of that here to make any professional writer turn green with envy), the grandiose Hollywood effects must take a back seat, at least some of the time. When directing Shutter Island, the legendary Scorsese should have reminded himself that sometimes less is more. As it is, this film is an excellent psychological thriller, one that cracked the glass ceiling but stopped just short of shattering it.",1268956800,2,2650,4.771241830065359
3606378,2,B001GCUO5M,"I love Martin Scorsese. I have enjoyed almost everyone of his films before this (with the exception of the last half of goodfellas). But this film is just nothing to write home about.

The story is about these 2 federal agents that are sent to an insane asylum to investigate the disappearance of an inmate. The longer the two federal agents stay there, the more suspicious they become of the asylum and the directors. The investigation slowly turns from looking for the inmate to trying to figure out the ""deep dark secret"" of the asylum.

The acting in it is superb. I am not that big of a fan of Decaprio but I have to hand it to him, he does very well in this movie. All other actors were great as well.

The story however was just uninteresting and predictable. I fealt that it was about an hour too long and for me at least after about 45 minutes into the movie I figured out the ending (and I'm usually the last person in the theater to figure out an ending before it happens). To me it was cliche and very predictable. For a movie that was billed as something that ""messes with your head"" and ""keeps you guessing"", it certainly didn't. After about an hour and a half I found myself checking my watch. I never do that in even the just ""ok"" movies I go to.

The sound design is masterful (a consistently unsettling horn signals danger). The suspense is palpable. I would recommend it fully, despite the ending revelation being a bit obvious. There is little blood and gore, relying instead on macabre imagery and good old fashioned scare-tactics (mood lighting, a scary storm, dark mental hospital environs). There is some violence in the form of WWII flashbacks that do a lot to characterize Leo's oddball protagonist.

3606381,4,B001GCUO5M,"I tend to look for movies that draw me in and that provoke an emotional response. Martin Scorcese's ""Shutter Island"" did indeed draw me in, even though I found the film disturbing. Scorcese explores difficult questions of guilt, personal identity, and mind control.

The movie takes place in 1954 on a craggy, remote and forbidding island off the coast of Boston. (I have some familiarity with a United States possession called Navassa, an uninhabited, little-known island in the Carribean surrounded by steep, inaccessible cliffs and was reminded of Navassa by the movie.) Shutter Island serves as a hospital and prison for the criminally insane operated by the United States government. A United States Marshall, Teddy Daniels, and his ostensible partner, Chuck Aule, who calls Daniels ""boss"", are ferried to Shutter Island to investigate the disappearance of a female inmate who has apparently escaped.  The inmate is said to have drowned her three children before her incarceration. Daniels himself carries with him many emotional issues.  He witnessed the liberation of the Dachau concentration camp and has had problems with alcohol. His wife died in a fire set by an arsonist. Daniels sought an assignment to Shutter Island because the arsonist and another individual from Daniels' past are incarcerated there, and Daniels wanted to see for himself what was going on.

At the hospital, Daniels meets the head psychiatrist, a bearded, crafty and intelligent individual named Cawley, and his sinister German assistant, Nehring. He meets with staff, with prisoners, both male and female, and with inmates of the ""C"" ward, used to house the most dangerous prisoners. As the movie progresses, Daniels suffers increasingly from tremors and from hallucinations, most of which are in the form of his dead wife warning him about the island.  Daniels also receives warnings and augurs from the patients. He senses that something is not right about the investigation but cannot let it go.

The movie has the makings of a gothic horror film, but it gets beyond that genre by its seriousness and development.  The movie builds slowly and inexorably to itconclusion and most parts of the story contribute to the effectiveness of the whole.  The feeling of isolation and doom is inescapable, with a mental hospital on a remote island, a hurricane which cuts the Shutter Island off even further from the mainland, and the chilling, hidden natures of staff and inmates on the island.
The movie includes scenes of cliffs and danger on the island, pounding waves, wild rats, a mysterious lighthouse, and lost souls. A difficult and troubled individual, Daniels comes to challenge his understanding of himself in a radical way.  I found the confusion in sense of selfhood, in circumstances of isolation and helplessness, chilling.

The movie is based upon a 2003 novel by Dennis Lahane called ""Shutter Island"" which I have not read. The acting is convincing throughout and the musical background is erie. The movie has received mixed reviews.  Scorsese's movies such as ""Taxi Driver"", ""Raging Bull"" and ""Gangs of New York"" with their portrayal of violence, illusion, and rawness have always fascinated me. ""Shutter Island"" did so as well. The movie has attained a large success at the box office, and perhaps can be viewed and responded to on many levels. I don't think it is for the faint at heart.

3606382,5,B001GCUO5M,"Five stars for Leonardo's brilliant acting in Shutter Island, a film that keeps you on edge from beginning to end with its numerous twists and unexpected turn of events, with its fusion of dream and reality, making it impossible to discern where one ends and the other begins.

Leonardo Dicaprio plays the role of Edward Daniels, a U.S. Marshal who has been given the authority to investigate the case of a missing female prisoner on Shutter Island, a prison for insane criminals. The woman has disappeared under obscure and inexplicable circumstances; circumstances that defy common sense.  Edward and his partner Mark, (Chuck Ruffalo) set about to unravel the mystery of the disappearance with the reluctant assistance of the two psychiatrists,Ben Kingsley and Max Von Sydow.  Shutter island has three wards, A, B, and C ,the last being the one where the extremely dangerous inmates are held.  This ward looms menacingly over the island as it is situated on a hill, its grey stone walls shrouded in mystery and foreboding,  entrance being restrictedto to personnel only.  Edward is immediately drawn by the place, sensing that the solution to the mystery resides within the gloomy depths of those high walls.

While on Shutter Island, Edward is haunted by images of Dachau and emaciated prisoners, bodies of women and children piled up, frozen in time, an eerie monument of accusation for the indifference shown by the rest of the world in its criminal reluctance to act promptly and thus avert one of the most horrendous crimes against humanity. He relives the U.S. Army's entry into this place of  horror and is persecuted by feelings of guilt,  guilt which haunts our hero Edward throughout the film; he is also haunted by dreams and visions of his dead wife during his stay on the island. She acts as a kind of Cassandra warning him about the place, telling him that all is not as it seems.  Sinister practices may in fact be taking place there, particularly in the isolated and inaccessible lighthouse, which as its name implies, is where our hero will be enlightened about his case and the facts about Shutter island.

The film is splendid in depicting the workings of the mind like ""a wheel within a wheel, never ending or beginning, like an ever spinning reel"". The flashbacks and his dreams are filmed in a bright yellow light, whereas his reality on the island is shrouded in mist.  After a certain point in the film it becomes hard to distinguish whether what he experiences is real or delusional, whether it is his dreams that are part of reality and his presence on the island a dream. The chase scene in ward C is stunning as it is an allegory of Edward's mind, dark and unfathomable, full of perilous routes and dangerous pitfalls. This scene is fraught with suspense and tension, worthy of old cinematographic masters, reminiscent of that brilliant chase scene in the sewers in ""The Third Man"". Scorsese portrays with brilliance the labyrinth our hero is caught up in, his mind being a dark and inscrutable maze from which he has to exit to see the 'light'.

Ben Kingley is the epitome of the ambiguous psychiatrist whose real motives we are never quite certain of.  Is he, in fact, an altruistic scientist or an evil twisted genius involved in unethical practices with a nazi doctor (Max Siddow)?  As a viewer one must be on the alert, prepared for the unexpected and to be aware of symbolism and metaphor in interpreting the events as they occur.  There is a lot of Freudian psychology so if you are fond of psychological thrillers then this film will most definitely keep you at the edge of your seat with its fascinating plot and superb acting.",1268524800,,3666,4.795238095238095
3606393,4,B001GCUO5M,"Mild Spoiler Alert. The story unfolds with two marshals searching for a patient missing from a secluded mental institution on Shutter Island that houses society's most dangerous, demented individuals. The edgy score tells us that something sinister is going on, that someone at the institution is hiding something, and that the marshals' lives may be in danger. It becomes clear that marshal Teddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio) has some hidden personal problems, some related to his g.i. days as flashbacks show him participating in the liberation of Nazi concentration camp victims and the execution of the camp guards. As Daniels and his partner probe deeper into the institution, and as Daniels suffers increasingly troubling hallucinations, you become anxious for resolution. This is answered in a gripping reality twist as Daniels' problems are painfully revealed by staff psychiatrist Dr. Cawley (Ben Kingsley).

Acting is excellent. DeCaprio gets increasingly better with each role he takes on. I first saw Van Sydow in two 70's thrillers, The Exorcist and Three Days of the Condor, and even though he's near 80, he still adds a chilling, evil flavor to any film even with only a minor role. On the downside, unnecessary and disturbing views of murdered children tell me that as much as I enjoy Scorcese, this film will not be as appealing to most viewers nor as successful as it should have been.",1268265600,,1402,5.122270742358078
3606394,5,B001GCUO5M,"Shutter Island marks the fourth collaboration between director Martin Scorsese and actor Leonardo DiCaprio. The film is Scorsese's follow-up to his Best Picture-winning The Departed and is adapted from the novel by Dennis Lehane, whose novel Mystic River was the basis for the terrific Clint Eastwood film. Shutter Island is a different breed of film from both that film and previous Scorsese films. As a director who has been working since the 1960s, you wouldn't expect him to have anything new to offer as a filmmaker, and you would be wrong. Shutter Island is a psychological horror film with shades of similarities to films like Secret Window and The Game (story-wise; specifically in the conclusion), but it's the way Scorsese handles the material rather than the material itself that makes it as good as it is. Shutter Island has beautiful cinematography, lovely art direction, and a haunting score...It's not the story that stays with you as much as the atmosphere.

DiCaprio (who is in every scene) plays Edward ""Teddy"" Daniels, a U.S. Marshal from Boston circa 1954, who is sent to investigate the mysterious disappearance of a patient at Shutter Island's asylum for the criminally insane. With his new partner Chuck (Mark Ruffalo) in tow, Teddy is immediately baffled by the woman's disappearance and suspicious of the ominous doctors (Ben Kingsley & Max Von Sydow) who run the asylum. Haunted by dreams of his dead wife (Michelle Williams) and his time in the war; Teddy slowly unravels the mystery housed at Shutter Island with shocking, albeit semi-predictable results.

I've compared the film to Secret Window and The Game, but this comparison is a reflection of various parts of the plot. As a film, it's much more reminiscent of Stanley Kubrick's The Shining and Lars von Trier's Antichrist sans the sexual mutilation. The cinematography led me to specifically recall Antichrist as both films share a similar artful quality and creativity in the area. There are scenes in Shutter Island that are breathtakingly beautiful, some even capturing that beauty in the grotesque and horrifying. As for the comparison to The Shining, Scorsese has made a film that is so atmospheric, it draws you into both the setting and the mystery of the film in the way The Shining did. To say this film evokes Kubrick is an understatement; it's the closest thing I've seen to a Kubrick film since Kubrick died and I doubt Scorsese would deny that influence.

As you could expect from a Scorsese film, it's filled with terrific actors giving terrific performances but it's DiCaprio who carries the film. DiCaprio is a misunderstood actor, equally loved and hated by moviegoers/critics. Some think he's wooden, incapable of evoking any real emotion while some see him as one of the greatest working actors. This performance should sway some of his naysayers, as DiCaprio gives one of his best performances as Teddy. This is a complicated character, with many dimensions to him and DiCaprio embodies those dimensions perfectly with plenty of nuance. The supporting players are all perfectly cast as well, sometimes making quite an impression with only a single scene, such as the terrific Jackie Earle Haley.

Certainly some will find it slow-moving (although at 138 minutes, it never feels long) and even more will see the long-winded ending as a bit of a cop out. I wasn't disappointed by the ending due to the inclusion of the haunting scene at the Lake House and Scorsese leaving his audience with just a little bit of ambiguity. This is a terrific film Scorsese has made here. It's a horror film of the sort that isn't made anymore; an intelligent horror film for intelligent people. It's the first great film of 2010, proof that DiCaprio and Scorsese bring out something special and powerful in each other.

3606395,2,B001GCUO5M,"Leonardo DiCaprio  is fantastic as Teddy Daniels. Also this fim does a great job of making you the viewer feel delusional.  That being said I thought this film was quite dark and perhaps even evil.
Humanity loses out in this film.

Furthermore it was a thinly veiled attack on those unfortunate few who are attempting to thwart the system.

For example Project MK-ULTRA, or MKULTRA did exist.  (Project MK-ULTRA, or MKULTRA,) From Wikipedia
 MKULTRA was the code name for a covert CIA interrogation research program, run by the Office of Scientific Intelligence. This official U.S. government program began in the early 1950s, continuing at least through the late 1960s, and it used United States and Canadian citizens as its test subjects. The published evidence indicates that Project MK-ULTRA involved the surreptitious use of many types of drugs, as well as other methods, to manipulate individual mental states and to alter brain function. And worse hospitals and Doctors did partake in such experiments.  This sinister Dr Ewen Cameron was just one of the few to partake in mind control experiments.

The experimental treatment they use on Marshal Daniels I felt was a bit over the top as well.

This film in terms of suspending disbelief and creating a dream like hell is even more sophisticated then Avatar.

I though this film should also have been Rated R.",1268179200,3,1365,5.0
3606396,4,B001GCUO5M,"I'd have to see ""Shutter Island"" again to really gage whether it is above or below Scorsese's potential--my original viewing of ""The Departed"" was quick, rushed, and though I recognized it was above average, I made the mistake of not realizing how intricate and masterfully crafted it really was.  A long standing Martin Scorsese fan, I think his hardcore fans must have the feeling that the man's mind is moving in darker and darker avenues these days.  Though the end of this one is a little less ""doom wins"" then ""Departed"", it echoes a similar sentiment: mankind can never really grasp truth, and oftentimes lives in elaborately constructed avenues of corruption rather than facing the truth and dealing with it. Scorsese's grip on his Catholicsm has become tenuous at best.

There are questions Scorsese deliberately evades to make us wonder a bit more.  What was in the cigarettes so generously passed out in the asylum?  Why are Max Von Sydow (echoing Dr. Mengele and the Nazi threat) and Ben Kingsley (with plans that may be real? for an unethical ""energy treatment"" of the mentally ill, echoing the A Bomb) conducting such a ridiculously lengthy experiment on this patient in particular?  How did they know a storm would take place before the ""ferry"" left?  Is the director also making a negative comment on the advent of psychotropic drugs, hospitals, etc before they were thoroughly developed and maximized by the state?

The revelation about Teddy Daniels at the end of the film did not at all surprise or shock me.  There were times--for instance, when Daniels is questioning a ""patient"" about her role in the disappearance of a fictitious child murderer--where it seems as though David Lynch had stepped in to Scorsese's shoes to say: ""Everyone's insane!""  The flashbacks to the concentration camps were so disturbingly effective that I'd put them on par with quite a few quality holocaust films, though of course it isn't *just* about his experiences at the camps.  Mahler blasts, roses fall, SS officers die, and Teddy winds his way through a psychological maze right to his own--also uncertain and vague--ending.  Why would a guy who shot someone under those particular circumstances consider himself a complete, unredeemable monster?  That was my main foible with the film--Teddy loathes himself *that much* for snapping when his children have just been drowned, etc?  His crime was capital, of course, but anyone could have argued for an insanity plea.  Indeed they could have.

But this only points to the moral heart of the story.  We do not know everything, we cannot know everything, and some ideas of right and wrong, what we have or haven't done, can never be clearly and crisply answered.  This is the darkest Martin Scorsese movie I have ever seen--it is to his film canon what ""Hour of the Wolf"" was to Bergman's: a thorough exploration of the artists' subconscious.  While I won't say at all that this matches up to ""The Departed"", it is certainly one of Scorsese's more vulnerable films and not to be missed.",1268006400,,3038,4.933202357563851
3606397,4,B001GCUO5M,"I was excited to finally get in the theater and see this movie.
As I sat and watched this movie play out, I got a really uneasy
nervous, queasy feeling, it was such a visually moving piece of cinema but
not always easy to follow. Great acting and directing, the scenery, especially the weather helped give the movie a nice surreal  tone and I just love being in that dark, dank, institution for the criminally insane. Creepy. I think the movie
plays with you and makes you think with its constant twists. Leonardo DiCaprio
is excellent in his role from start to finish. It certainly wasn't a perfect movie but its well worth seeing for it period in time and the twists.",1268006400,,669,4.483606557377049
3606398,3,B001GCUO5M,"Martin Scorsese brought what he could to Shutter Island but something gets lost on the journey.

The acting is strong as ever, with under-rated Mark Ruffalo as a solid co-lead against Di Caprio's. Every character is filled with somebody especially adept in their roles at every turn from Ben Kingsly and Michelle Williams to Jackie Earle Haley. Max von Sydow rounds out the cast with chilling effect and Elias Koteas manages to steal one scene.

Production and costume design was top notch, with everything you would expect from a 1950s period piece.

The scenes that work are chilling and disturbing. Several flashback scenes and dream sequences are the strength of the movie, with images and subject matter that I'm sure Mr. Scorsese and the crew had trouble filming. While Martin has never strayed away from violence in past movies, the awful horrible things in this movie are far more provoking and deeply disturbing.

Unfortunately it never amps up the tension. The Departed was more taut which is a let down. The introduction to the island is ominous and brooding with a tense score, but for some reason I never felt any danger being on the island. Even as it seems like Di Caprio's world is falling apart most of the danger happens in his own mind, so you never venture to the edge of your seat. The editing could of been tightened up as well. The plot kinda clunks around with no real flow, going abruptly from one scene to the next.

(minor spoiler)
The biggest thing that kills the movie Di Caprio's character uncovers a conspiracy that never feels believable. The movie would have been far stronger if you could believe that his character's paranoid delusions could be real and he will never be able to uncover the truth and escape the island but its never credible. I never felt that it was possible for what he believed to be going on at the island to be true.
(end spoiler)

Leo's last line is the best part of the movie. It leaves what you have seen somewhat ambiguous of what his last action of the movie means. I can't explain more of that without completely spoiling the ending.

Overall, the movie could have been stronger. All the pieces were in place but something felt missing and it tumbles and fails to seriously impress. The parts that work give you chills, the parts that don't are because they feel too similar to other additions to the genre. It's all very unfortunate.",1268006400,33,2397,4.679334916864608
3606399,5,B001GCUO5M,"Martin is always trying to give you the proper mood depending on the movie.  He has done it again.  A great film that we all kind of know what is happening but we love to see it thru Martin's eyes.  For someone who studies film, we can appreciate this film and what it does to us.  It basically gets us dizzy from the start of the movie, and keeps us light headed, because that is the only way to make you enjoy this movie.  Why is this Marshall feeling so sick in the boat?  Why can't his partner get his gun out the proper way? Why are there so many guards greeting these two officers?  Martin gives away the reality in the first 5 minutes of the movie but we become part of Edwards or Andrew's Fantasy and we enjoy every minute of the lie.  Will most likely get nominated for an Oscar for director, film, and maybe even actor (if D. Lewis and S. Penn don't make a film in 2010, he might finally get his well earn Oscar, mainly because of Martin)  If you did not enjoy it, I can understand, it is not meant for some, the way he directed it might come across as clumsy, but actually that is exactly what Martin wanted.  He is no rookie, no one can direct that movie any better.  Perfection and always paying respect to other film makers in order to make it even better to watch.",1267833600,15,1279,4.137651821862348
3606400,4,B001GCUO5M,"Filled with surreal imagery, supported by strong performances from Leonardo DiCaprio, Ben Kingsley, Mark Ruffalo, the marvelous Max Von Sydow and Jackie Early Haley ""Shutter Island"" has some magnificent moody movements and while it isn't great Scorsese it is very good indeed. A mystery thriller based on Dennis Lehane's (GONE BABY GONE)novel the moody mystery revolves around a patient that has simply vanished from an island for the criminally insane and the pair of federal marshals Teddy Daniels (DiCaprio)a troubled veteran of World War II still disturbed by the images he saw when he helped liberate a German concentration camp and his new partner Chuck Aule (Ruffalo) trying to determine why they are being stonewalled about her disappearance. It's clear from the beginning to Daniels that the staff at the isolated hospital seems to be hiding something the trouble is that everything seems to be hiding in plain sight. On the surface they get cooperation but it's also quite clear that there are members of the staff and even some of the patients that have been carefully rehearsed to hide something.

While ""Shutter Island"" isn't among the best films that Scorsese has made it does demonstrate what a talented film director can do with good source material. At turns spooky and suspense ""Shutter Island"" probably could have been trimmed about 10 minutes. The main flaw of the film is that it doesn't pander to its audience by using rapid fire editing techniques to generate an artificial feeling of suspense and unease instead relying on craftsmanship and strong, intelligent performances by the performers in the film. Keep in mind that ""Shutter Island"" is an example of a slow, moody thriller and, in many respects, is a throwback to the type of thrillers we might have seen in the 70's (which isn't a surprise given that Scorsese came of age as a film director during that time). Don't expect the rapid fire editing of ""Final Destination"" or linear narrative of most contemporary films. ""Shutter Island"" has more in common with ""Memento"" or Chris Nolan's mixed genre thriller ""The Prestige"" than ""The Bourne Identity"". I'd also note that the film is a moody homage to Hitchcock's thrillers.

Scorsese has never been a director that has focused on complex plots (although there are exceptions in his career but those exceptions have usually been when he's been paired with a strong writing collaborator) as much as complex characters. Perhaps that's the Achilles' heel of ""Shutter Island"" as the occasionally careens out of control as we watch Teddy dig deeper and deeper into the mystery that drives him to want to discover the evil at the heart of ""Shutter Island"". Working with the novel's strong more conventional narrative may have been too much a challenge for the director and his creative visuals. Nevertheless even if he does stumble the film manages to hold together fairly well and continues to be entertaining. Fans of the novel, suspenseful mystery thrillers, DiCaprio and Scorsese will still find much to admire and the last sequence in the film still cuts deeply.

The conclusion of the film particularly the last dialogue exchange between DiCaprio and Ruffalo validates the film. Scorsese makes ""Shutter Island"" a suspenseful thriller that echoes some of Hitchcock's classic psychological thrillers (particularly ""Vertigo"" in its stylized look)producing a film that isn't afraid to look into the abyss of a lost soul in fear that the abyss might look back.",1267747200,3,3483,5.096322241681261
3606401,3,B001GCUO5M,"Let's be honest...how could this film not be any good?  Best living director in Hollywood? Check. One of the best and most reliable actors working today? Check. Ovah tha tahp Bahstan accents? Fahkin Check. That being said, I was a bit worried when Paramount Pictures decided to move Shutter Island from its Oscar-ready time release in November all the way to movie wasteland in February with Dear John and When in Rome (sorry ladies). That type of change usually only means one thing--the movie isn't any good. With Shutter Island, however, we have an exception. Sort of...
  Based on the novel by Dennis Lehanne, Shutter Island takes place in 1954 at a mental facility for the criminally insane along the coast of New England. Detectives Teddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Chuck Aule (Mark Ruffalo) have been sent to investigate the seemingly inexplicable disappearance of one of the hospital's female patients. From the second they arrive on the island, it is clear that there is something eerie and mysterious going on. Everyone from the prison guards to the doctors seem to be hiding something. As they dig deeper into their investigation, they realize that there is much more to this place than what meets the eye.
  Scorsese holds nothing back with this film. He is one of the most talented and innovative directors out there and he uses all the tools he has here to create over 2 hours of relentless tension. DiCaprio also turns in another brilliant performance as a troubled US Marshall trying to focus on his job while still being haunted by the memories of his missions in WWII at the Nazi concentration camps and the recent death of his wife. Beyond this ambitious directing and stellar lead performance of DiCaprio, however, the movie as a whole isn't anything to write home about. The story itself isn't anything we haven't seen before. Scorsese does his best to gloss up the material as much as possible and he does manage to elevate this film from an otherwise average script.
  As you watch the movie unfold and start to put the pieces together, many people will be able to see ending coming before the final twist is revealed.  This doesn't necessarily make it a bad film, but at the end of the day, this is nothing more than a minor entry in Scorses's incredibly impressive filmography. Shutter Island is basically what happens when you give B-list material to an A-list director. If nothing else, the visceral experience that the movie offers is well worth the price of admission. Just don't expect another Departed or Goodfellas with this movie.

3606402,5,B001GCUO5M,"It is well known that Martin Scorsese is a master filmmaker. Decade after decade he has continuously defied conventional formulas and provided artful films that explore all sides of the human condition. Granted, most of his films delve into the darker recesses of the human mind, and Shutter Island is no exception. It is a haunting experience, a film which uses both abstract and concrete techniques to tell a story. It may connect with mainstream audiences and it may not - but this much is true: in a society where Avatar can gross over six hundred million dollars and receive a nomination for BEST PICTURE of the YEAR, Shutter Island is a welcome luxury. It's like a drink of cool water after a particularly dehydrating hike in a desert abounding with the sort of intellectually devoid effects- driven action films, inane romantic comedies, and manipulative tearjerkers which are transforming American audiences into mumbling, drooling philistines year after year.

Shutter Island is the rare type of film that is difficult to review, only because it contains many plot twists which are crucial to the fantastic finale. In an attempt to avoid unnecessary spoilers, a brief outline of the plot will be provided, followed by a technical and artistic critique of the film.

The film opens in 1954, as a lone ferry arrives on an island which is reminiscent of Alcatraz, only it is not a prison in the usual sense. Rather, it is the location of a prestigious mental institution which houses only the most threatening patients, most of which have been committed for murder. After the disappearance of a vastly disturbed female resident, two U.S. marshals are summoned and arrive on the site to investigate, and fall upon one shocking revelation after another.

This film is drenched in atmosphere from beginning to end. From the opening strains of Gyrgy Ligeti's haunting chamber piece ""Lontano"", to the initial appearance of the island itself, there is no doubt - you ""feel"" this film. Once the mood settles in during the first few moments, it stays with you until the credits roll. Through this expertly crafted juxtaposition of atmosphere and musical selection, Shutter Island springs to life.

The performances are uniformly amazing. Leonardo DiCaprio gives another knockout performance as Teddy, one of the marshals assigned to the case. Like Robert DeNiro and Harvey Keitel before him, DiCaprio's acting sensibilities have captured the attention of Scorsese, who has continued to cast him in several notable roles over the past few years, the most significant of which is his role in The Departed. Through Scorsese's direction, DiCaprio has been able to grow as an actor, and the results of this partnership are clearly on display in Shutter Island. Mark Ruffalo plays Teddy's partner, Chuck. Ruffalo exudes the necessary amount of intensity required by his character, and is wholly convincing. Scorsese also manages to draw some fantastic performances out of screen legends, Ben Kingsley and Max Von Sydow. These two men convey a palpable sense of dread throughout the film in varying degrees. Watching the two men work under Scorsese's sure-fire direction is worth the price of admission alone. Patricia Clarkson also appears and in a memorable supporting role, and the same can be said of Michelle Williams.

As far as the direction itself, if you want to see a master at work, look no further than this film. It is a marvel in all aspects. This is Scorsese in top form. This is a film that simply cannot be missed.

Rated R for disturbing violent content, language and brief nudity. 138 min.",1267401600,4,3599,5.0201005025125625
3606433,4,B001GCUO5M,"...doesn't mean they aren't after you!

Do we really need to state Martin Scorcese's brilliant craftsmanship and talent at this late date?  It is all on display here, in his latest collaboration with Leonardo DiCaprio.  Moody and dark and imbued with an atmosphere of paranoia and dread, of deep mystery and conspiracy, I was completely caught up in this effort to take genre material and find new energy and inventiveness within it.

The early scenes were so overlain with sombre music and portents I was afraid it was going to be too much, but quickly was mesmerized by the tension Scorcese creates and the imagery he creates to bring the movie down into the realm of conscious and unconscious fear and nightmare, of reality and memory. And it is great imagery and flawless technique that continues to spin the tale as it pitches through raging storms without and within toward a conclusion that I was afraid might be a let down, but I found, while not unexpected, surprisingly workable and satisfying.  And, there is even a final kicker that really makes it all worthwhile!

I have to admit I find some critics mystifying.  I think the two doofuses on TV said to Skip It.  Really? Compared to what?  I have to wonder why some people go to the movies.  Is it an intellectual exercise?  Sure, there's that sometimes, but can't they ever allow themselves to be seduced by the sheer ebullience of people working at the top of their game with familiar yet re-imagined material?  To suspend belief just for fun? Shutter Island didn't spring from a world where themes of insanity and conspiracy have never been dealt with before, but it does so with originality and force!

I confess there is still a kid in me that can put aside pre-conceived notions and intellectual pretenses and simply be swept up in the vision of master craftsmen working with good writing and interesting material. It worked for me here.  I can understand if it doesn't for you, but anyone saying the movie doesn't have punch and interest, well....aw, whatever.",1267401600,4,2030,4.7793696275071635
3606434,3,B001GCUO5M,"The plot is interesting at first and the first one hour fifteen will have you hooked. Di Caprio is good at first but soon you will find the movie goes into a very sketchy study of schizophrenia, war, guns, dark walls, island, revenge and disappearing acts in 1954.

Let's talk about the director. Having done just about every sort of classic, Martin Scorsese seems to have made Shutter Island as a homage to Kubrick and Hitchcock. I read somewhere that this is a bit like a modern day shining. I beg to differ, The Shining had a good story while Shutter Island tries very hard to confuse and make sense at the same time. Some people might have even guessed the mystery, some people like me would have waited till the last scene only to be told something that would make sense but still seem a little lofty.

Leonardo is Martin's favourite actor without a doubt. They have always made a great team but with Shutter Island, I found myself a little disappointed because it left me feeling a little robbed of a worthy end. The climax leaves too many things unanswered. I fear this movie is terribly slow and difficult to be watched at home so I'm glad I went to the movies. BEWARE of the loud pangs of horns and music that will hit you time and again, every time an ocean shot is shown.

Gandhi, I'm sorry, Sir Ben Kingseley was a relief with a very clean little important role. The names will confuse you no end. Mark Ruffalo has done better films but I found his character quite meak though he gave it his best shot. From start to finish, the film centers around Di Caprio. He's in every single scene.

What I liked about this film is how despite being slow it holds you by the end of your brain's wits. You will forget your life for that 2 hours and 30 minutes, you will switch your blackberry off and not want to speak a word to anyone. That disconnect truly highlights Scorsese's great potential for drama.

This film is definitely beyond the attention span of my generation.",1267401600,,1976,4.432506887052342
3606435,4,B001GCUO5M,"What can I say? I liked the film. This seems to be Scorsese's first foray into the ""pyschological thriller"" genre and I think he pulls it off fairly well. It's not a perfect film, and probably not all that original, but it's suspenseful and disturbing and it provoked a significant emotional and intellectual response from this reviewer. There's some interesting cinematography as well. It would be hard not to sympathize with DiCaprio's character Ted Daniels, a US Marshal who travels to an island in 1954 Boston harbor to ostensibly investigate an escaped mental patient. Upon his arrival, of course, things get a bit fishy, and we soon learn about Daniels' own tortured history which becomes inextricable from his work. From there, there's a few twists and turns which ultimately end in a fairly surprising and satisfying denouement. A good thriller and an insightful peek inside the world of the mentally ill.",1267315200,,913,5.052980132450331
3606436,5,B001GCUO5M,"Martin Scorscese's ""Shutter Island"" recieves Masterpiece Rating. One star means don't bother, two stars means wait till it comes out in pan and scan on HBO. Three stars means see it at the theater and rent the dvd. Four stars means  see it twice at theater and buy dvd. Five stars means the film transcends it's genre, ( in this case it is important to note this is an ADAPTATION of a novel. see it more than twice, buy the blu ray and immediately listen to the directors commentary upon first viewing. (smiling)
Only a Director of Scorscese's stature could command the resources to adapt Dennis Lahane's novel. Dubbed alternately ""speculative"" fiction, or ""meta"" fiction, the film captures the elusive gravity of the original prosaic presentation.
Make this movie with ten directors, and of course, you would have ten versions. I can only comment on the Scorscese version, NOT the one that film critics or Lahane fans wanted to be made.
In another directors hands, the films style, aided by long time Scorscese collaborators in Production, Casting, Art Direction, Director of Photography, Musical Score, and Costumes, would border on parody. In the master's hands, it becomes the finest adaptation of a novel into a ""Thriller"" yet made.
If one were to name the 20th century, in particular, the first half of the 20th century, my nomination would be ""Century of the Psyche"". Medical Science faced and empirically proved the validity, and reality of the soul, the psyche. It was also the American Century
It is fitting then, that the film takes place in the 1950's in America.
The story centers around a Federal Marshall, Teddy Daniels, and a new partner ""from the Seattle office"", Chuck, journeying on a prison ferry, to an island 11 miles off the coast of Massachusets.
Investigating the disappearance of a female prisoner, we soon learn that Daniels lobbied for the assignment, and that he has an agenda of his own, involving the arson death of his beloved wife.
The late Doors frontman and singer, Jim Morrison, in a paper he wrote while attending UCLA film school, remarked that film attempted two basic things. To present Dreams as ""real"" life, or to portray ""real"" life in a dreamlike quality. ""Shutter Island"" acheives the rarified status of fusing the two categories.
Disappointingly, after a week of so-so reviews nonetheless not having the slightest effect on a 40 million dollar plus opening, a marketing blitz mentioning "" a twist "" causes the slightly more than normal intelligent viewer to arm themselves with guesses and hunches that distract from the artistic genius of the film.
Regardless, the film delivers in every category.
English, it is said, was a gift to the world in that the language, fluid and protean, ever changing, describes more accurately than all others, emotion. It is in the emotional expression of that language that Leonardo DiCaprio's Oscar worthy performance outdoes any other in this, the fourth collaboration with Scorscese.
A note: the symbol of the Monster arising from the collective Psyche of the human race has a simple origin. It is simply the soul's snapshot of its own ""unfinished Self"". Searching for, finding, and coming to terms and integrating the Monster, is a Hero's Journey, and Teddy Daniels is heroic.
Left guessing between real and fantasy, dream and reality, hallucination and actual, we accompany Teddy on his journey.
At the end of our journey, we are left with our own unfinished Self. Asking the same question Daniels does to his partner Chuck. ""Is it better to die a Monster, or to live as an Honest Man?""
Owing to Scorscese's and DiCaprio's Stellar efforts, and Lahane's genius in donating a container to hold and answer the 20th century's greatest question, those affected by this film, will ask it of themselves each time they view the film, and each day as well.
Note; The films final credits roll to a hybrid song combining Dinah Washington's ""This Bitter World"" and classical string music. This haunting song presented by Robbie Robertson perfectly encapsulates the journey as well, letting the viewer down gently to go and meditate on the lesson's learned.
A work of unqualified beauty and power, wholly unique in the history of Hollywood Thrillers,it is, I repeat, a Masterpiece.",1267056000,3,4253,4.981715893108298

It's very hard to write about the plot of this film in any detail without spoiling it.  Suffice to say that I was engrossed by the masterful direction (Martin Scorsese), the intriguing setting, and the magnificent cast (which includes Ben Kingsley and the always delightful Max Von Sydow).  However, I also felt that the film did not play fair with me.  Early scenes set the stage in such a way that I felt cheated by certain revelations that came later.  While those revelations did give an added dimensions to some plot points that had seemed incongruous, they also seemed to open some holes in other respects.

3606438,4,B001GCUO5M,"There are in this world mental institutions that are brightly lit, orderly and clean. These places are filled with disturbed patients, and an overworked, but determined, staff of orderlies, doctors and nurses who all do their best to help the people under their care. They are kind and do everything they can to improve the lives of their patients in the hope that some day these sad people might be released.

You will never see one of these places in a movie.

The asylum in Shutter Island, the latest film from famed director Martin Scorsese, is a dark, sullen place. It is filled with shadows and dripping water and fading light. The staff is occasionally helpful, but mostly obstructionist and occasionally downright dangerous. This is the movie asylum taken to the nth degree.

To this asylum arrives Teddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio), a US Marshall investigating a locked-room mystery where, somehow, a patient, who was in there for killing her three children, has managed to escape. With his newly-assigned partner, Chuck Aule (Mark Ruffalo), he meets the deputy warden (John Carrol Lynch), who, as usual in these pieces, explains the rules of the asylum, takes their guns and shows them inside.

Once inside they meet Dr John Cawley (Ben Kingsley, in his best role in ages), as well as a German, one Dr Naehring (Max von Sydow). Daniels doesn't trust the German, and hasn't exactly had a warm spot in his heart for any Germans since he was part of the squad that liberated Dachau.

From there things get strange. A storm lashes the island. The missing woman turns up. Someone else goes missing. Memories get confused and Teddy's ability to tell reality from fiction starts to fade rapidly, bringing up the question of how contagious insanity might be.

This is a very good film. It's not Scorsese's best, but it's easily up there with The Aviator and is better than Gangs of New York. True, he's not at the top of his form, but his second-best is still better than most director's mangum opuses (opii?).

The acting, especially by DiCaprio and Kingsley, is truly top notch. The cinematography and sets are nicely creepy without being too overwhelming. The ending is perhaps a bit muddled and might take a couple viewings to make sense, but this is a film that's worth seeing again and again. It is easily the best film of 2010, at least so far.

From the trailer you'd think this was a creepy, nearly supernatural thriller, but it's much better than that. It's a voyage into the mind and to a place where you really, really hope that all your dreams don't ever come true.",1266969600,2,2580,4.756152125279642

It is a period film that takes place in the mid-1950s and follows two US Marshalls played by Mark Ruffalo and Leonardo DiCaprio, as they make their way to an island off the coast of Massachusetts that houses and attempts to rehabilitate the very worst criminally insane patients.  Scorcese uses both intense personal drama and the story's winding and mysterious premise to create a remarkable and intriguing suspense that feels like a hybrid of Hitchcock and some of Stanley Kubrick's later films.  It is a movie that will go over the heads of most of its audience during the first viewing, but to its core it is a psychological thriller that not only displays madness in a palpable frame but does so with astounding cinematic flair, and goes even further in making a commentary on the great flaws of violent men.

Funny how some of the most savvy film critics have derided Shutter Island for lacking some of the elements I've already praised, but I can't help thinking they were preparing their judgments well in advance simply because of the film's delayed and altogether unconventional release date for an esteemed veteran filmmaker like Scorsese, who like anyone else at or near his level should release their films in the fall, just so everyone knows what movies to give awards to.  This actually might be one of my favorite Scorcese films, not only because it is one of his few movies that deviates from being simple gangster glorification, but because it is not a genre film at all.  I had a hard time pigeon-holing this movie as a horror film or just a general suspenseful drama when its means are far greater than just giving us a puzzle or scaring the hell out of us.  Either way it blows The Departed out of the water in my humble view, but then again my favorite Scorcese movies are&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Age-of-Innocence/dp/B00003CX8S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Age of Innocence</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Last-Temptation-of-Christ/dp/1559409037/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Last Temptation of Christ</a>, so take that for what it is.  We all have our opinions I suppose.

Scorcese is a great director but not necessarily because he makes great stories and creates cutting edge films.  It is because at times he takes already great stories and makes them into shiny and exciting films, and also because he possesses his actors so well that they almost always get the credit that he might often deserve.  For years it was Robert De Niro, who outside of the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Godfather-part-II/dp/B0007Y08MY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Godfather part II</a>&nbsp;has only been truly great under Scorcese.  The same can be said for the way that Scorcese has contained the frenzied method acting of Daniel Day Lewis.  But now, and perhaps in the future surpassing both aforementioned actors, is Leonardo DiCaprio, who in my view might deliver his most touching and satisfying performance to date.  This is a guy who simply should not care whether or not the Oscars of 2010 remember his movie, because it is just another highlight in what might possibly turn out to be the greatest Hollywood career of his generation.  Neither should the rest of the cast that includes great work from Max Von Sydow, Ruffalo, Emily Mortimer, Michelle Williams, Ben Kingsley, Jackie Earle Haley, and Ted Levine.

Shutter Island also captures New England in a way that few films have and growing up there myself certainly helps my appreciation of that.  Its cinematography is what we've come to expect from Scorcese's films but that doesn't mean it shouldn't go without specific praise.  The movie is visual perfection in addition to being a challenging, perplexing, and powerful motion picture. Despite a curious release date, and one that keeps it from competing in a 2009 Oscar awards ceremony that it would likely do quite well in, this is a layered commentary and an impeccably well-made production, and I must give it my highest recommendation.",1266969600,3,4444,5.500734214390602
3606440,2,B001GCUO5M,"Take a brilliant director Martian Scorsese (Taxi Driver, Goodfellas, Cape Fear,) Mix in an outstanding cast, Leonardo DiCaprio, (Titanic, Blood Diamond,) Ben Kingsley (Schindler's List, Gandhi) Mark Ruffalo, (Reservation Road, Eternal Sunshine of a Spotless Mind) and Michelle Williams, (Brokeback Mountain) and one instantly concludes Paramount Pictures likely has another iconic hit movie in ""Shutter Island.""

Filmed in Massachusetts around my neck of the woods, Shutter Island is the tale about the disappearance of a criminal insane patient. Federal Agents (DiCaprio) and partner (Ruffalo) are sent to this factitional island off the cost of Boston to investigate. DiCaprio's character soon finds the search is on for two missing patients, discovering one missing patient is not listed on the hospital roster.

The whole scenario would seem to make for an intense wild ride in this quote advertized ""mysterious psychological thriller."" In reality, ""Shutter Island"" may have been best pushed off the island cliffs into the deepest part of the Atlantic, all the way to Davey Jones' locker.

Through the first half hour plus a ""Jaws"" like theme plays but nothing happens that warrants the unending annoying scary music. The soundtrack is also so loud it is a distraction to the dialog of the movie. However, this mismatched music score does not turn out to be such a bad thing when I realized the entire movie is nothing but one line of dialog after another. The dialog never stops. Shutter Island is all talk, talk, talk, and more talk with no action. I personally became so tired of the continuous rambling dialog, I thought about hanging myself in the movie theater just to escape Shutter Island myself.

In less than a half hour I already knew the probable ending to ""Shutter Island."" I thought to myself, ""self, the movie just can't be that lame and simple,"" but it was. I ""shutter"" to think this movie made it off the shelf.

I read Paramount did not have money to promote the film for its original release date in 09 causing a delay till February, 2010. Paramount broke? I searched the internet looking for articles which suggest Paramount Studios is broke. I found no such articles. Maybe the truth is Paramount executives watched a preview of ""Shutter Island"" and decided they should all disappear too, rather to face the music.

This so called ""thriller"" is no thrill. The mystery of ""Shutter Island"" is quickly discovered by any average movie goer. If however you are a fan of mismatched music scores, cameras that pan to quickly and people who talk a blue streak and another blue streak and yet another and another, so on and so on, this movie may be just what you are looking for. Otherwise, just like the Bismarck in World War II, someone should put ""Shutter Island"" out of it misery and sink it, or sent it to the island of misfit movies.",1266796800,3,2855,4.912863070539419
3606441,4,B001GCUO5M,"Relax. This review won't give away the ending which comes as somewhat of a surprise, although many will admit to guessing the overall situation pretty early on.

If you like your mysteries drenched in atmospheric surroundings, look no further than SHUTTER ISLAND. Director Martin Scorsese starts out with murky skies and a foreboding of doom as two men (a sheriff and his partner) approach a rocky coastline on a ferry as an ominous looking island looms into view. The plot, although keeping the viewer in a sea of confusion as it unravels, only becomes clear toward the last thirty minutes--but until then, the less you know about the outcome, the more you will enjoy the satisfying ending.

None of the exposition is direct. Instead, we see the story from the viewpoint of a man (LEONARDO DiCAPRIO) who is obviously very troubled about tragic incidents in his past and who only gradually begins to see things in a different light. His journey is compelling right from the start, thanks to the marvelous performances of DiCaprio and MARK RUFFALO who begin their investigation into happenings at the island housing the mentally insane--some of them very dangerous cases.

Director Martin Scorsese has the benefit of an excellent cinematographer, ROBERT RICHARDSON, whose camera work makes every frame of the film captivating. All of the exterior scenes along the rocky coastline of Maine have a sinister look. The story is told in a leisurely way but there is always an air of mystery in the relationships between the main characters, including BEN KINGSLEY as the psychiatrist in charge of the institution and MAX VON SYDOW as a suspicious looking German doctor.

It's best not to dwell on the final outcome--but let's just say it probably won't come as a complete surprise to everyone. Nevertheless, it's the sort of thinking man's psychological thriller that any mystery fan should be able to savor.",1266796800,,1902,5.0094936708860756
3606442,2,B001GCUO5M,"Scorsese is the Man.  When he's great - more often than not - he is the greatest.  Even some films of his not accorded much praise(such as ""King of Comedy"" and ""After Hours"") are terrific. ""Age of Innocence"" is, for my money, his best film, with ""Raging Bull"" a close second.  When he is great, he is untouchable.  When he is middling, he sinks.  ""Cape Fear"" had nothing over the original - and ended with the most absurd river-ride of attempted terror ever put on film.  ""The Last Temptation of Christ"" makes Mel Gibson's ""Passion"" look like ""Citizen Kane.""

Anyway..now we have ""Shutter Island.""  Lots of people loved it, lots hated it.  Same with the critics.  It is that sort of flick. To me, it has to be one of the most lugubrious, leaden, sleep-inducing, yawn-energizing movies I've seen in some time.  It is shot with a muddy, murky, somewhat Hammer-horror look to it. That's fine and dandy, but the story drags on and on and on with a plot that would be almost impossible to follow if one didn't surmise the ending about midpoint in the film.  Blame the story then, and not the great Mr. S.  If you took the backbone of ""The Wicker Man"" (the original), big chunks from ""A Beautiful Mind"", the noir and period ambiance and jaw-drop ending from the old Mickey Rourke film ""Angel Heart"" and mixed in some jiggers and teaspoonfuls of certain Twilight Zone episodes and lots and lots of bits and pieces from the original television series ""The Prisoner"" (even parts of the just-made remake)....well, if you took all of those sources and put 'em in a blender out would come ""Shutter Island.""

There are alot of other movies very similar to this one, thematically, but I can't remember all of their titles.  One starred Jeffrey Hunter in the early sixties, another had Warren Beatty roaming around an institution with a twist ending.  Anyway....once upon a time Martin Scorsese had the ambition to film a biopic on the life of George Gershwin.  That would have been one hell of a movie!  Scorsese already had practice on musicals with ""New York, New York"" (another maligned film that I thought was very good.)  Too bad he never filmed the life story of one of America's greatest song-writers who died so tragically at age 39. The young DeNiro would have been perfect in the part. Just like there was alot of talk about a filmed biopic due out in 2009 on the life of Poe to commemorate his 200th birthday - and Robert Downey Jr. was touted as a possible Poe.  He would have been perfect in every conceivable way!  But the Gershwin pic falls through the cracks and a terrific part for Downey ends up nowhere...and instead of what could have been another ""Chaplin"" for Downey  we get his talents wasted in ""Iron Man II.""  Sometimes, the best laid plans are, indeed, of mice and men...

I digress...but only because I was very disappointed in the Maestro's latest offering.  But God bless him for all he has given us.",1266710400,4,2915,4.602713178294573
