8494048,5,B0066E6UNK,"Two great Movies from the 1930s. Joan Blondell and Glenda Farrell are of the same genre of Laverne & Shirley 35 years earlier. If You are into Fashion, the costumes are Creative Plus. Acting is great. For black-white movies, they are very Colorful.",1467504000,3,248,4.790697674418604
8494049,4,B0066E6UNK,Joan Blondell is sexy as hell in both pictures. An extra treat with I've Got Your Number is it shows what was high tech in 1933.,1417564800,4,128,3.9615384615384617

8494051,4,B0066E6UNK,"I really enjoyed these two pre-Code comedies.  They are funny, fast-moving and pretty racy.  I've Got Your Number is the better of the two -funnier and more toward modern tastes.  If you like Joan Blondell or enjoy pre-Code movies, you should watch these fun movies.",1390003200,9,266,4.866666666666666
8494052,4,B0066E6UNK,"Two old movies on one disc, neither being famous or familiar, so the selling point is the leading actress(es). With the recent splurge of older films being made available on DVD, it's fair to ask: are these really worth it? and the short answer is Yes.

""I've Got Your Number"" is a light thriller/romance/struggle [which is to say, a typical early 30s Warner Bros film] that makes good use of the telephone company. Pre-Code elements are little more than some suggestive dialog while adding a phone line for peignoir-clad female customers. Blondell first appears 20 minutes into the film; it's really Pat O'Brien's film, a duty he almost manages. Good roles for Eugene Pallette and Allen Jenkins, and strong pacing makes for good replay value.

""Havana Widows"" would be better titled ""Gold Diggers of Havana"", though it doesn't have any songs in it -- or even Havana for the first 18 minutes. No matter; it's energetic, with typically strong roles for Guy Kibbee & Frank McHugh, while Glenda & Joan are great at both parading improbable gowns and being wisecrackin' blondes [though Joan seems to be a red-head here]. Allen Jenkins is strong enough in his scenes that you may find yourself more sympathetic to him than the actresses. Another well-paced programmer.

Both films are in great condition & well-transferred, capturing George Barnes' lovely photography of his new wife and her co-stars. Neither are landmark films: at most, we might say that ""Havana Widows"" is the best of the Farrell-Blondell brassy-blonde films. Both run just over an hour with few challenges to the Hays Code. In other words, a fine double feature worth the price. 7/10 = 4/5 stars",1388448000,8,1661,4.946236559139785
8494053,4,B0066E6UNK,"I've got your number is a pretty good B-movie,a little bit comedy,a little drama
just what you expect from a WB B movie.
Havana Widows is I guess you would call it a screw ball comedy,",1332720000,8,184,4.138888888888889
