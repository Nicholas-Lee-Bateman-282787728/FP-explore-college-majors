6141878,4,B00H91LVOM,The film was enjoyable but not great. It was dark in places which I enjoyed but the character development was a bit poor.,1395532800,8,121,4.304347826086956
6141879,2,B00H91LVOM,"GREAT ATTEMPT...but more on par with a syndicated TV series like HERCULES or XEAN...corny script and eye rolling acting with laughable fight sequences...and OMG how much was the WATER BUDGET for RAIN sequences! (you've never seen so much RAIN in your life). It tries to be WATCHMEN, HELLBOY with a dash in SIN CITY but it just doesn't cut the mustard! If you can sit through the whole thing, you must have SUPER POWERS.

6141880,5,B00H91LVOM,"I write this review neither as a professional critic nor as someone directly involved with movie making. Instead I am simply a long time fan of movies in general and of the various genres that make up the melting pot that is Sparks. Sparks in its simplest description is a combination of noir style and superhero action with a late 1930s to early 1940s backdrop. It is a wonderful film and should be included in anyones personal catalog of DVDs. That having been said, getting down into just what makes this film special will yield even more impressive details.

Sparks is based on a graphic novel of the same name written by Christopher Folino. During the original run of the comic he and William Katt (yes of Greatest American Hero fame) decided to try to bring it forward as a film. Theres more to it than that but this is supposed to be a review of the film and hot a historical treatise of it. However, it does bear to point out that the film was produced completely independently. It is very much a labor of love and it shows in the finished product.

Visually the film is a study in contrast. Scenes are shot in a way that is similar in feel to a combination of Sin City and a theatrical production. Because the production was completely independent and was shot quickly in one location, a lot of green screening was used. Much like it was in Sin City but it doesn't take anything away from the shots. Its the same kind of feeling you would get watching a play where you know the characters aren't actually in the location they're pretending to be in but you accept the conceit and go along for the ride anyway.

The effects overall are magnificent. Yes certain nitpicks could be made about their quality if you were to go frame by frame but given that all the visual effects were the work of TWO guys alone, its a marvel of artistry and talent. For a superhero movie, there aren't that many big, in your face effects (no city destroying climax here) but how and when they're used is done to perfectly illustrate and forward the plot which is a lesson that many effects heavy blockbusters could learn.

The musical score is perfectly interwoven to the film and blends in with the entire package to nicely frame things and add to the flow without being blaring or overpowering the dialog. It is dramatic without being corny. No noticeable dead girlfriend violin.

The acting was spot on with Chase Williamson (John Dies At The End) going from adorably dorky one moment (the meeting Lady Heavenly scene is perfect illustration) to pissed off world weary the next with ease as Ian Sparks. Ashley Bell (Last Exorcism) is wonderful as Lady Heavenly in every aspect of the character. To say more about her portrayal would be to spoil a bit of plot. Clancy Brown, Jake Busey, and Clint Howard all turn in stellar performances but William Katt deserves special note for his chilling portrayal of Matanza. He delivers his lines and presence with a gravitas that is calm and sinister without being campy.
The plot and writing is where the movie shines the most. Like most noir works (at least that I've seen) the film makes heavy use of flashbacks. Sometimes repeating the same moment but from different points of view or with people admitting things they hadn't before. Sparks will not spoon feed you everything up front but by the end of the movie you will get what was going on. Fair warning though that it will not happen until quite literally the last minute but the film does tie up all the loose ends in a very satisfying way. More than once you will find yourself going Ohhhhhh so thats what that was.

So to sum up, is the film absolutely 100% completely perfect? No. But it is a masterpiece of ingenuity, storytelling, and a perfect demonstration that for all the jadedness in the world, theres still some magic to be found in movies. Beyond all that, its just a fun movie to watch with a great story and the world needs more great stories. Heres to hoping theres a sequel somewhere down the road.",1395187200,27,4004,4.5464632454923715

If you like comics, superheroes, noir, good actors, Watchmen, 300, occasional violence, good story, cool characters, and just an entertaining movie, see Sparks, period.  It's unlike anything you've seen up, I'd bet.  It is rare for independent films to have more than one or two well known actors...that speaks to the strength of the story.  The cast for a film like this is remarkable, and to me says a lot about the film by itself.

6141884,5,B00H91LVOM,"This doesn't have big hollywood special effects, but it has what's missing in a lot of hollywood action films: an actual story and plot.  It's a film noir super-hero movie, with lots of dark murky tones.

The acting is overall, pretty good, everyone does what they need to do to move the story forward.  The effects are just good enough to do the job, but you can tell that they saved a lot of budget here.  But I'd rather have a  movie like this, where it's obvious everyone involved really worked on it and loved it.

Not saying that this is guardians of the Galaxy, but that this a great example of low budget movie making.  I'd love to see more things like this, so we have more creativity.  Certainly this movie has a different feel than all the marvel movies (which I love).  It's nice to see someone trying to do their own thing.",1418515200,14,836,4.341935483870968
6141885,4,B00H91LVOM,"First of all, I would like to correct the ""not-rated"" designation. A warning to all parents and those with weak stomachs: this movie is not for the faint of heart. If you cannot handle dismemberment (including fingers getting bitten off...literally), I suggest you fast forward through those parts.

On the other hand...

I saw this movie sometime earlier this year (or perhaps last year), and I immediately fell in love with it, not because it is a film about superheroes, but because of two different reasons. First, this is an independent film that does not fall under the label of any big brand industries (not that they produce bad films...of course), and that the director and the graphic novelist took the liberty of working together on this project. For an independent film, this was a pretty good piece of work. Second, I love the story. It definitely has the same feel as Watchmen, Sin City, V for Vendetta, or even 300...combining good drama with great dialogue. While simple, it is really fun. Sometimes simple stories are more entertaining than complex ones. Am I right?

Next, I must talk about the awesome cast. Chase Williamson is brilliant as the titular character; you can almost feel his pain, regret, and loss during intense scenes. Ashley Bell is absolutely adorable and sexy and charming as Lady Heavenly (a corny name, but a name that really, really works nonetheless), and of course we have Marina Squerciata as Dawn, the ""lovely creature"" who also wins Ian's heart. Jake Busey plays a really awesome jerk in the form of Sledge, a character whose costume is obviously a nod to Juggernaut from Marvel. And, of course, William Katt is brilliantly evil as Matanza.

Then...who can forget Clancy Brown as Archer, the ""guardian angel"" of Ian Sparks. Now, for those of you who are familiar with Brown know him to be an incredibly versatile voice actor who has played dozens of roles, from Mr. Krabs from SpongeBob (a surprise for me!) and Savage Oppress from The Clone Wars (oh yeah!). But I just realized that he is actually a pretty decent actor. I recently watched him as General Wade Eiling on The Flash (CW), and he plays such a great bad guy! But the role of Archer was practically made for Clancy Brown, and he fills this role so well.

All in all, a great, simple, fun, fast, and furious independent film about the dark side of superheroes. My only complaint? The film was not long enough! And not enough action!

Other than that! Great job to everyone who worked on the film.",1416787200,,2502,4.740229885057471

This will be partial background on the movie itself for those who need more info on the movie's background, part review. I will admit I've been a fan of the series since the comic books first came out a few years ago. This first started as the comics series of six parts, but was incomplete due to an omission by the publisher's previews, costing them orders (only four were made). It recently was fleshed out into a graphic novel, adding the remaining two parts and additional panels.

In addition to the series, the creator of the comic - Christopher Folino, decided to produce a movie on it because he said he didn't want to look back and wish he did, and along with William Katt and others, got a well rounded cast of folks who have a passion for film to be a part of the movie. Some casting was twist of luck and fate (Clancy Brown) others had been part of the animated comic early on (William Katt, Ashley Bell). There are several names who have been in the industry in this - Katt, Brown, Clint Howard, and a few newcomers as well - Bell, Williamson and Marina Squerciati (now on Chicago PD).

But the one thing people need to understand is this was an independent movie, not done with the millions of dollars that you see in say ""Hunger Games."" When you don't have millions of dollars to spend, you use what you have - even sometimes having to temporarily stop production to raise funds, and get creative.

And for an independent movie having to use what they had and be creative, it's very good. It's a nice escape from the traditional superhero and even crime shows we see today. You have the atypical hero in Sparks (Chase Williamson), who is anything but the chisled and perfect superhero, and then you have Lady Heavenly (Bell) who does her best to do good and fight crime. You have your overall bad guy in Matanza (Katt) but there are a few surprises here and there.

There are twists and turns that will surprise even the most ardent of readers of the series.

Now, is it perfect? - no. There are times if you focus on the details you realize repeated items in the background and if you don't have a working knowledge of the series - even just watching the trailer will explain a bit, it can confuse you in areas, but compared to many independents out there that DO have funding through other sources, this can compete with the best.",1402531200,,2394,4.454337899543379
6141900,4,B00H91LVOM,"Sometimes, a movie is great for greatly exceeding expectations. Sparks: The Origin of Ian Sparks exemplifies such a movie. I did not anticipate a low-budget DTV being so good.

This superhero-noir hybrid amalgamates plot elements from Kick-Ass, The Spirit, and Batman; however, it makes all of those elements darker. Watchmen inspired this movie. This tale's ""heroes"" operate with all of the morality of the Watchmen. Therefore, like Watchmen, Sparks becomes a morally complex tale appealing to adults.

The story's plot, a mystery, is likewise admirably complex, and a person might have to rescreen the DVD to fully follow the movie's events. I admire such craftsmanship. I compliment the Sparks film-makers for creating such a challenging and thought-provoking work. The setting even has a good aesthetic. Like Sin City or Burton's Batman, the setting mixes time periods and certain landscapes. Thereby, it re-presents successfully a fantasy world relatable to our own. Please, check-out this fine movie. We need more like it.",1402531200,,1028,5.41875

6141905,4,B00H91LVOM,"This is a film that people seem to really love or absolutely detest; I actually thought it had some very strong points and fell a bit flat elsewhere. It is a `superhero' tale and based on the graphic novel which tells the story of a meteor crashing to earth causing a genetically mutated group of people who become known as `the Rochester 13'. Then we have the story of the hero or rather `superhero' Ian Sparks (Chase Wiliamson - `John Dies at the End') whose parents are killed in an exploding car incident that was partially caused by the cops.

We jump ahead a number of years and Sparks has decided to go out righting wrongs and in the end teams up with Lady Heavenly played by Ashley Bell (`The Day') then they come up against a super villain and the rules of the game change forever... type thing.

Well all of that is pretty predictable and I quite liked the suspending belief as you swallowed their stories of woe. It unashamedly plays for the `noir' feeling and in many ways copies `Sin City' with its use of graphics and live action. However, it lacks the pathos of that film and is never consistent with the noir feeling, so at times it feels like we got only half the film that the makers wanted us to see - that may have been down to budget. The action is ok at best and sporadic and you will be amazed at a shotgun that causes no damage to the moving vehicle  it is fired at, whilst killing the passenger.

Some have criticised the acting, but I think they had to play it in a kind of cheesy tongue in cheek way as the whole thing is quite unbelievable and some would argue that is as it should be. If you are a fan of super hero type films this will tick some of your boxes, if you are hankering for a noir then look elsewhere - if you just want some not too sensible viewing fun then this more than passes muster.",1400889600,3,1830,4.22

6141907,5,B00H91LVOM,"Graphic novels are perfect source material for film making; they feel like storyboards, after all. While reading the Graphic novel this movie was based on I knew it had to become a film. The noir sensibility was spot on; dark, red and shocking dread. I needed to see it on ""film"". There is always some trepidation when someone translates from a comic book (or any book) to the screen. So, with my expectations deliberately held in check, I went to the screening... Boom! Man, I was so happy with what the director(s) did. No spoilers here, but if you read the novel (which I highly recommend) you won't be disappointed. Ashley Bell is beautiful and perfect for her role. Bil Katt is spot on and tough. Chase Williamson is the only person who could have balanced the title character's role. What can you say about Clancy Brown?

6141908,3,B00H91LVOM,"The problem with Sparks is that it's unfocused. Its seems as if the script writer tried to make both plot and character equally important and as a result each suffered from a lack of attention. I wanted to know what happened in the movie, which means that the it had elements of suspense and a potential for excellence, but then the plot got stalled in order to focus on the characters childhood or his thoughts and feelings and then that got stalled to return to the plot. This is not necessarily a bad thing, except one of these (plot or character) should have taken a back seat.

The premise (good vs. evil) of the movie was also chewed up in the way the story was told (boy gets a power and uses it for good. Villains also have power, which they use for evil). It felt as if I were on a roller coaster ride that kept stopping and then jerking to start again, moving forward so far and then again jerking to a stop until finally the movie reveals the hero's truth.

6141917,4,B00H91LVOM,"In todays world of $50 to $150 million plus budget films, even the ones with the smallest casts, there comes a film once in a while - on a low budget  that comes out with a sharp sense of style, intrigue and uniqueness that while watching the film, you know there was a lot of heart and passion that was put into making it. Sparks is definitely one of those films.

Taken from his Graphic Novel of the same name, screenwriter and co-director Christopher Folino brought a lot of imaginative style and a film noir-like ambiance to this project. Along with co-director Todd Burrows they brought together a very unique cast and crew to make a very ambitious concept work on the big screen. I applaud the directors for their inventive design and nature of making this feature look and feel very good.

Basically its the story of supers, those with special powers and abilities, that were granted to them by a fallen meteorite back in 1920s and their legacy both hidden and feared surfaces in the life of Ian Sparks  a super who cant seem to find his place. Chase Williamson (Video Game High School, The Guest) stars as Sparks. A strong character who goes through many challenges of the head and heart as various things in his past are revealed. (And, not all them good!) Chase gives a good straightforward performance and has nice on-screen chemistry with his co-star Ashley.

Now as for Ashley Bell (The Walking Dead, The Penguins of Madagascar) playing Lady Heavenly, a super with her own history and ideals that eventually intertwine and mix with Ians and in ways you don't see coming. Ashleys performance is honest and true and she has a beautiful on screen presence that makes her character bold and venerable at the same time while keeping a sharp edge to her own mysteries. Ashley, also doing her own stunts, was pure excitement to watch and the camera really likes her.

Another really powerful performance with duality and intrigue came from Clancy Brown (Starship Troopers, The Shawshank Redemption) as Archer the man who has more twist and turns thank Ive seen in a character in a long time and he plays each mystery with a sharper edge than the one before. I liked his energy and almost coy shrewdness toward Ian, but as you learn there is a lot more to him than meets the eye.

Jake Busey (Contact, The Killing Jar) also plays an amazing multi-leveled goodie/baddie not quite sure where hes coming from or what hes about type of guy. I liked his on screen presence and energy when he makes it clear what his mission is about in finding the supers and its not exactly what you are going to expect.

Playing the main baddie, but well hidden with his super ability is William Katt (The Greatest American Hero, Carrie) who does mean and nasty very well. Youll not like him very much when you understand his agenda and what he does to get there. And William plays the witty evilness with a creepy edge.

Clint Howard (The Grinch Who Stole Christmas, Apollo 13) gives a fierce and over-the-top performance as the exactly you would expect the film-noir editor to be like. He reminded me of the old film chiefs who always barked their thoughts no matter how crass or inappropriate they were. Clint jumps off the screen when he is on camera.

Marina Squerciati (Chicago PD, Gossip Girl) plays Dawn a real Super with a not so super past but a truly amazing power. Marina plays it to the tee and in her scenes with Ian and Ashley there can be seen a lot of fireworks both visible and not visible.

I want to make note of the two wonderful cinematographers Josh Fritts (Turn and Burn) and Jackson Meyers (Escapeseeker) who did an amazing job at giving the warmth and tone of the old film-noir-type films of the past with such vibrant shadows, lines and colors. Even the visual effects made me feel like I was turning the pages of a real live graphic novel but on the big screen. Also the chilling, powerful and haunting score of Jacob Shea (Beyond the Wormhole) really set the mood and tone for the film and was humming that fierce backbeat when I left the theatre.

Overall Sparks is a very stylized film with some great performances, a wonderful score with a real nostalgic look and feel to it and except for some slow moments in the very middle, it has a very interesting beginning and a very insightful unraveling of its characters at the end. It has action, sex, violence, mystery, super powers and a lot of passion.",1397520000,2,4417,4.584283903675539

8631068,5,B00H91LVOM,"I didn't know what to expect from this low budget Indy film but it was really good. The acting, story and direction is great. This movie is based on a graphic novel of the same name. Chase Williamson who plays sparks is excellent and Ashley bell who plays lady heavenly is great this movie takes place in the 60s and is in the style of dick Tracey. Great movie for being independent. I will give this movie cinematastic. If you have not seen this movie then I recommend you do",1521417600,,476,4.3

8631072,5,B00H91LVOM,"I read quite a few reviews before purchasing this movie. Some of the reviews made some interesting accusations, almost causing me to reconsider my purchase. They were outweighed by some very positive reviews, and I must say that I'm ecstatic that I went with this movie over any other.
This movie is a perfect recipe and not your average, run of the mill superhero tale.
All I can say about it simply is Pay Attention. Don't look for deep meaning or intellectual quandaries. Go in not expecting much. At the price, it's worth a shot.",1453075200,,533,4.621052631578947

8631074,1,B00H91LVOM,"I was excited at the film noir styling's of this flick, having grown up on a heavy does of the old Superman show. I enjoy low budget slower paced pieces with fun character development but this movie fell far short of the mark. This movie just seemed to be trying to hard to be clever and the characters are so painful to watch. I wasn't sure if this was supposed to be satirical or actually paying homage to film noir. There was no one to like and the story just felt forced and pointless, I really don't understand how something like this got made.",1438992000,,549,4.288461538461538
