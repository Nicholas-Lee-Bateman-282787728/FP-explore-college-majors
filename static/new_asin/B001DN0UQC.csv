3534866,3,B001DN0UQC,"Negi and his girls go on a seaside vacation. After accidentally seeing Asuna naked, Negi is depressed about her being mad at him. The other girls come up with a silly plan to reconcile them. After that, They all go to a spa resort. Nothing important happens. Nodoka spends most of her time wit Negi while the other girls try to get his attention away from her.

This special is fun, but that's about it. It's rated TV MA. I think that's overdoing it a bit. It's just a bunch of girls in towels and bathing suits, with an occasional suggestive scene or 2. This should really be TV 14. It's everything you expect from Negima!? Just a little more risque.",1354060800,,651,4.380165289256198
8294187,2,B001DN0UQC,I loved the series but this.. Is just a sad fanservice that focuses too much on just one girl.. It's watchable but you have to be a hardcore fan  to enjoy it.,1524441600,,158,3.9375
8294188,5,B001DN0UQC,"While I found this an invigorating romp of comedy/fanservice which being a subplot to the series, only being a two episode OVA special, unless you are a diehard fan of the series or enjoy a little off-hand humor, I'd say skip it.",1495497600,,229,4.476190476190476
