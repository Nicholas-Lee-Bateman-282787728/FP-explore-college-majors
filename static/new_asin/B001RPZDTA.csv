8338559,2,B001RPZDTA,"The opening credits for this little film seemed to be dragging on far too long, especially when the music ended but the credits didn't. Then there's voice-over, two people, one of whom is asking the other what happened to the music. Later in the film, a similar attempt at humor occurs when the actors suddenly start speaking in Spanish. It was as if at times the film tried to be&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Airplane/dp/B000B5XOWA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Airplane!</a>, albeit unsuccessfully.

The story itself is simple. A student inherits a house from a relative. Alas, the relative dabbled in black magic, something the student is unaware of before he decides to host a Halloween party there. In many ways, ""The House of the Demon"" is reminiscent of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Night-of-the-Demons/dp/B0001ZX0GK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Night of the Demons</a>&nbsp;though not nearly as good. The acting is mostly competent, and the presumably tiny budget, though evident (as in a scene at the school that is supposed to be in a classroom but looks for all the world like a stage at a small theater), does not interfere too much with the film. But the awkward dichotomy between comedy and horror never meshes (unlike, say,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Feast/dp/B000GLL1U6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Feast</a>), and I found myself singularly unimpressed.",1243209600,5,1502,6.51
