3133301,5,B0014I7AQO,"It would take some nerve to write a story based upon a well-known book by none other than Charlotte Bronte (Jane Eyre). Wide Sargasso Sea is successful, and in it's own right. So why did the beautiful wife of a young Englishman get locked up and get labeled mad? Why the fire?

Jean Rhys story has been beautifully brought to film with Rebecca Hall making the romantic loves and losses of Antoinette believable. Her nude scenes leave little to the imagination inside the honeymoon Jamaican house. She throws herself into assuring the young Edward love her. If nudity and sexual situations offend, stop here.  It's unrated but probably should be considered an R due to the fleshy parts.

It is 1830s, and Antoinette forfeited all control of her 30,000 dowry. Does she not deserve passionate romance?  But secrets and whispered tales abound. Antoinette is caught between the English and Jamaican worlds, owned by no one except...her now suspicious husband.  Will her history destroy the future? You will feel for the heartbroken Antoinette through her unsuccessful attempts to lure back her Englishman's love. Who's right? Who's betrayed? Who's mad?

This is a 5-star book adaptation worth a second viewing, and then the third watch can be coupled with ""Jane Eyre"".  Very well done by BBC Wales (Kudos) and then Acorn Media with the DVD.

3133304,5,B0014I7AQO,"Jean Rhys came to fame following her novel Wide Sargasso Sea. Most often the novel is read as a colonial-feminist corrective to Charlotte Bronte's Jane Eyre. The madwoman in the attic is here given a voice through her daughter who reenacts a self-same fate. The merits of the novel are manifold, and it is an exceptional feat that here is a rendition of the narrative with such vivid emotional energy and lush psychological initmations that it must be regarded as a magical piece of moviemaking. Mind you, my ratings are on the main consevative, but it would be best to append cum laude to this quiet production. The cast is outstanding so much so that the nuances of the tale are diffracted with dexterity while retaining the ambiguity of the textual equivocations, whereby no one character is easily packaged in an easy interpretation. Rather we see the coils and wranglings of passion, culture, conceit, pride, diffidence and the allure for the ""other"" with such sparkling clarity through a spectrum of carnivalesque dialectics that each character unveils a personality both complex and of vertiginous depth. The texture of the plot thickens with every turn and the allusions to Jane Eyre transcend the indulgence of the passions lived by the two main protagonists and the ""colonial markings"" are traceable everywhere. Adumbrations of postcolonial trauma, the wretched of the earth of the Carribean so to say, inform the espousal of two culture with that jarring brush of victimhood that stems from a people of insurmountable resources and affectations that are illegible to its counterpart. History is brought in as necessary but always contextual and well-pleated within the unfolding of the story. The music, the landscape, the overall pulsing energy makes of this tale of madness a prism through which women speak the candor of their inner turmoil as men betray themselves in an attempt to civilize the mind and soul of the truly free. And please there is no romanticizing involved here. In fact, even nostalgia proper is absent. Romantic reservations climax upon a crisis of identity that is ostensible and undeniable. It is a snapshot of a picture that bleeds with emotional beauty, and where the mixing of blood is frustrated by a magical hex that seizes the protagonists in an impasse that is heartfelt and indelible.

This TV version is filmed, like its predecessor, in the fantastically beautiful green island of Jamaica, and it's certainly beautiful to watch.  It stars several lesser-known young performers; as the young Englishman Edward Rochester, Rafe Spall(&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Masterpiece-Theatre-Room-With-a-View/dp/B0015LPRSI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Masterpiece Theatre: Room With a View</a>;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Shaun-of-the-Dead/dp/B0006A9FKA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Shaun of the Dead</a>,); as beautiful Creole heiress Antoinette Cosway, Rebecca Hall (&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Prestige/dp/B000LC55F2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Prestige</a>); and as obeah woman/servant Christophine, Nina Sosanya, (Peter O'Toole's recent TV film&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Casanova-Masterpiece-Theater/dp/B000HEWGWE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Casanova (Masterpiece Theater)</a>). All inhabit their roles fully, giving us a well-balanced cast.  The film script follows Rhys's book in shifting the action of Bronte's from the 1810s to the 1830s, shortly after slave emancipation.  It was adapted for the screen by Stephen Greenhorn; directed by award-winning Brendan Maher (""The Road from Coorain"").  It tells the unhappy backstory of West Indian heiress Bertha Mason, as she was to be known in her later life, the first Mrs. Rochester; the madwoman in the attic whom Jane Eyre must defeat in order to become the second Mrs. Rochester.

Surely, in the history of Western literature, there can have been few more inspired ideas than that of Rhys's; to develop the tragic kernel at the heart of ""Jane Eyre,"" and few writers better equipped to do it.  Rhys, a twentieth century novelist, was herself born in Domenica, a British colony in the West Indies; she was the daughter of a Welsh doctor, and a third-generation Creole woman of Scottish descent.  She knew the snobbish, repressive, patriarchal culture very well; and also the uneasy social position of the Creole woman - generally understood to be not necessarily entirely of white ancestry, but accepted as such for necessary social reasons. (At one point in the story, a servant calls Mason a ""white cockroach,"" a slur that I understand was frequently directed at Rhys in her own early life.) This dichotomy, of course, creates a tension that will be very difficult for such a woman to handle, and can be seen as a major cause of Mason's madness; in addition to the fact that she fails to understand England, or the English, properly: she just cannot see that Rochester is a typical proper Englishman of his time.

Rhys, born in 1890, led a wandering, alcoholic, bohemian life all over 20th century Europe.  She is widely esteemed as a feminist author these days, as are all her works, but most particularly ""Sargasso,"" and its heartbreaking tale of a woman at sea in an alien culture.  She had an affair with noted novelist Ford Madox Ford, reputedly had a threesome with him and his Australian wife, published a novel&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Quartet-Norton-Paperback-Fiction/dp/0393315460/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Quartet (Norton Paperback Fiction)</a>&nbsp;about it all, and certainly benefited from his literary advice.  She also had a relationship with omnisexual British jazz singer/author George Melly; she and his bandleader John Chilton wrote a sardonic song about it: ""Living with You."" Most of her books utilized modernist techniques and West Indian sensibilities, to deal with wandering penniless women, no longer as young and pretty as once they were, seeking one more generous man.  As a writer, Rhys fell silent for many years mid-career, until she published ""Sargasso"" in 1966.  The novel won the prestigious W.H. Smith Literary Award, also the Royal Society Literary Award.  She said about it, ""It has come too late."" She was made a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature in 1966, and a Commander of the British Empire in 1978, a year before her death.

Mind you, this is not to take anything away from Bronte, herself, also a deservedly feminist icon these days, as is her Jane.  Both remind us that it was possible for women to snatch achievement from even the most patriarchal culture.  Furthermore, Bronte may have written a great romance; but she was realist enough to recognize that it was built on the misery and misfortune of the shadowy madwoman in the attic.

We have here a great, fresh story, well-told, that was filmed alongside a new version of ""Jane Eyre;"" and adds a lot to it. You should see them together if you can manage (and, thank goodness, it's got subtitles).",1211068800,34,6021,6.255139056831923
3133307,5,B0014I7AQO,"This movie is so beautifully made and what a great story.  The crazy woman from Jane Eyre was a young woman who just wanted to be in love.

3133308,2,B0014I7AQO,"In it's own right, this slight tale may have had something going for it, but its spurious connection to Jane Eyre lays it to waste.

Rochester was always a flawed character, but this Rochester is irredeemable.  He does not bear any relation to the Rochester of Jane Eyre who loves Jane for her goodness and precisely for what she is not: disingenuous, conniving, sophisticate.  This Rochester is all of those things.  He marries solely for money; he is cruel and faithless.  On hearing of the fate of his wife's mother, he comments heartlessly, ""Oh how dramatic,"" which is such a betrayal of Bronte's Rochester as to be offensive.

There is absolutely no sense of conflict in this movie; incredible given the subject matter.  The characters are both cardboard cut-outs.

Then there are the production idiocies and howlingly bad devices.  Rochester fearfully contemplates his wife's impending lunacy while gazing upon a full moon.  At times the music telling the viewer how they should be feeling is so loud that it overwhelms the dialogue, which cannot be heard at key moments.

This has atmosphere, but that's all that can be said for it.",1385510400,2,1139,4.9109947643979055

Still, it's visually well-done and there is significant character development of Antoinette though Edward Rochester's character feels lack-luster here.

3133312,2,B0014I7AQO,"The original 140 page novel on which the film is based was short enough that the filmmakers felt they literally needed to flesh it out a bit.

The original had heaps more content, actors that better fitted the parts, better costuming and magic. I found this version boring and it didn't do a good job of telling the story - probably partly due to the fact that half of the story seemed to be removed.

I thought that the movie managed to get across some of Rochester's cultural disorientation, and was, like the book, not immediately harshly judgemental of him.  It was beautifully filmed, emphasising I thought the overwhelming and faintly threatening nature of the vegetation, and Rochester's culturally determined antagonism to the coloured servants who were freed slaves. Altogether a good experience, a movie I will watch again.  Delivered promptly, in excellent condition.",1282953600,,638,5.489795918367347
3133315,2,B0014I7AQO,"Wide Sargasso Sea is one of the best books I've ever read, but the movie does not even compare. In fact, if you haven't read the novel, I think this film would be really confusing because key parts are left out. I cannot believe that there is no filming of Antoinette's childhood, or the plantation fire, or her time in the convent. All of this is left out - the only mention of it is when Antoinette is telling the story to Rochester.  During this narration, it seems as if the film is just BEGGING to have a flashback showing the action of what she is saying, but nothing. The ending is also really confusing - again, unless you have read the book you probably will not understand what is happening.  The only thing I liked about this film was the actress playing Antoinette, which is why I gave the film two stars intead of one.",1257292800,6,831,4.32051282051282

The prices for the used copies here are somewhat reasonable, but the Amazon price is ridiculous for this 84 min. movie.  I'm glad I rented this movie because it was not at all what I expected it to be...

There are many ""lusty"" scenes if that's what you like, but to me it felt like the movie was very short and not your typical British romance.  It was interesting enough, but I don't think I would ever watch it again.  I have not read the book so I may not be the best critic...

Also, I know it's probably supposed to be like this, but Antoinette's voice/accent in this movie was very annoying.",1255564800,3,702,4.28030303030303

3367805,2,B0014I7AQO,"In it's own right, this slight tale may have had something going for it, but its spurious connection to Jane Eyre lays it to waste.

Rochester was always a flawed character, but this Rochester is irredeemable.  He does not bear any relation to the Rochester of Jane Eyre who loves Jane for her goodness and precisely for what she is not: disingenuous, conniving, sophisticate.  This Rochester is all of those things.  He marries solely for money; he is cruel and faithless.  On hearing of the fate of his wife's mother, he comments heartlessly, ""Oh how dramatic,"" which is such a betrayal of Bronte's Rochester as to be offensive.

There is absolutely no sense of conflict in this movie; incredible given the subject matter.  The characters are both cardboard cut-outs.

Then there are the production idiocies and howlingly bad devices.  Rochester fearfully contemplates his wife's impending lunacy while gazing upon a full moon.  At times the music telling the viewer how they should be feeling is so loud that it overwhelms the dialogue, which cannot be heard at key moments.

This has atmosphere, but that's all that can be said for it.",1385510400,2,1139,4.9109947643979055
3367806,1,B0014I7AQO,"A great post-colonial novel, one of the great ""writing back"" texts reduced to such schmaltz. Seedy and seething but about all the wrong notions.",1378080000,2,144,5.041666666666667
3367807,3,B0014I7AQO,"This version lacks the vividness and intensity of the older adaptation featuring Nathaniel Parker and Rachel Ward. Still, it's visually well-done and there is significant character development of Antoinette though Edward Rochester's character feels lack-luster here. Although I had no problem finishing the film, I really recommend reading the novel and even watching the earlier film adaptation to fully appreciate the story.",1377302400,2,426,5.887096774193548
3367808,2,B0014I7AQO,"My first thoughts during the film were that it is indulgent and pointless.  My second thoughts echoed the first, so I turned it off.  I thought that a pre-quel to Jane Eyre might be enlightening when it came to Edward Rochester's character, but I found the movie just stultifying.",1373068800,,280,4.6938775510204085
3367809,2,B0014I7AQO,"The original 140 page novel on which the film is based was short enough that the filmmakers felt they literally needed to flesh it out a bit.  Well filmed, well acted, beautiful setting.  Story line also reflects growing tension that we expect from this alternate view of the Rochesters'  marriage.  I was disappointed in that emotional complexity being overshadowed by more graphic depictions which I thought wasted the talent.",1366934400,3,428,5.159420289855072
3367810,1,B0014I7AQO,"Oh god, where to start. This version doesn't even compare to the original 2003 film. The original had heaps more content, actors that better fitted the parts, better costuming and magic. I found this version boring and it didn't do a good job of telling the story - probably partly due to the fact that half of the story seemed to be removed. Why would you bother to re-make such a great movie when you aren't even going to come close to the original?

3367811,5,B0014I7AQO,"As I am doing a University course on critical approaches to Jane Eyre I have been intrigued by Jean Rhys's retelling of the story of Rochester and Bertha Mason.  I thought that the movie managed to get across some of Rochester's cultural disorientation, and was, like the book, not immediately harshly judgemental of him.  It was beautifully filmed, emphasising I thought the overwhelming and faintly threatening nature of the vegetation, and Rochester's culturally determined antagonism to the coloured servants who were freed slaves. Altogether a good experience, a movie I will watch again.  Delivered promptly, in excellent condition.",1282953600,,638,5.489795918367347
3367812,2,B0014I7AQO,"Wide Sargasso Sea is one of the best books I've ever read, but the movie does not even compare. In fact, if you haven't read the novel, I think this film would be really confusing because key parts are left out. I cannot believe that there is no filming of Antoinette's childhood, or the plantation fire, or her time in the convent. All of this is left out - the only mention of it is when Antoinette is telling the story to Rochester.  During this narration, it seems as if the film is just BEGGING to have a flashback showing the action of what she is saying, but nothing. The ending is also really confusing - again, unless you have read the book you probably will not understand what is happening.  The only thing I liked about this film was the actress playing Antoinette, which is why I gave the film two stars intead of one.",1257292800,6,831,4.32051282051282
3367813,3,B0014I7AQO,"I completely agree with the previous review about renting this from the Library if you have to see it.  The prices for the used copies here are somewhat reasonable, but the Amazon price is ridiculous for this 84 min. movie.  I'm glad I rented this movie because it was not at all what I expected it to be...

There are many ""lusty"" scenes if that's what you like, but to me it felt like the movie was very short and not your typical British romance.  It was interesting enough, but I don't think I would ever watch it again.  I have not read the book so I may not be the best critic...

Also, I know it's probably supposed to be like this, but Antoinette's voice/accent in this movie was very annoying.",1255564800,3,702,4.28030303030303
3367814,1,B0014I7AQO,"As a previous reviewer noted that Jane Eyre devotees will likely be disappointed....I will offer a second to that opinion.  Further, we were forced to resort to subtitles because of the affected and wandering accent of the heroine and incoherent mumbling of the hero.

8255809,4,B0014I7AQO,"Hmm. I like the version with Nathaniel Parker and Karina Lombard better. They had better chemistry. Rafe Spall is more Rochester from Jane Eyre - gruff, superior, English. I always thought it was a leap from Parker's wide-eyed innocence to Bronte's character, even after everything that happened to him. And this version seems to make it clear that Antionette/Bertha isn't crazy in the slightest, which certainly puts an enormous dent in Rochester's character. I'm not sure how Rhys wrote her because I can't find it on Kindle. But still a good movie, beautiful scenery, as with the earlier version, but that one had the benefit of a haunting score, and also fleshed out Christophene and Antionette's mother. There was a nice line where Christophene says ""You will burn for what you did to her"" which I don't remember from the earlier version. By the end of this movie, you certainly want him to burn and badly.",1494288000,,911,4.846153846153846
