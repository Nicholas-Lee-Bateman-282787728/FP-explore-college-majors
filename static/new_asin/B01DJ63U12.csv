7712581,4,B01DJ63U12,"I am an artist myself, having studied many of its disciplines. And although my heart has wandered about so that now my medium is that of making tapestries - I feel, or sense that Holbein painted with or through, the Eye of his SOUL. Meaning that his portraits were the Veritable pulling of his sitters' souls, out and on to the canvas. Therefore, I believe he had a Naturally-Born talent to see, and then portray what his sitters, truly were. As an artist myself, I draw the souls I sense from the sitters before me. And that is a truthful a pulling forth onto the canvas, or, onto to live within the clay, which will be a TRUTH to be trusted.
ART IS TRUTH!",1512259200,,657,4.306451612903226
7712582,3,B01DJ63U12,"Started off interesting but I couldn't finish it, the presenter goes to great lengths to convince the viewer that certain people MUST be ""good guys"" because they're more attractive.  ""Because he was THERE!""  Well, yes he was.  Viewing events through his own personal bias as anyone else, the presenter even tells us Holbein's religious leanings so that to me discredits his role as ""expert witness.""  He should stick to presenting art.,",1508025600,,436,5.098591549295775

7712586,4,B01DJ63U12,"It's an interesting watch, although I agree that the presenter overdoes it at times.  I have my doubts that the paintings are why people are interested in Henry VIII, as opposed to the mix of religion, sex, violence, etc.",1500163200,,221,4.666666666666667
7712587,3,B01DJ63U12,"Entertaining, but when I checked out the presenter's assertions concerning the symbolism in the paintings, I could not find anyone who agreed. For example, he says lizards represent old age in art. Couldn't find that anywhere. I have my doubts about his knowledge.",1499904000,,264,5.162790697674419
7712588,3,B01DJ63U12,"I really enjoyed learning about Holbein and some of the people he painted. I absolutely HATED the presenter. He was here, there and everywhere. It was confusing as he went back and forth, bringing in other artists that I really didn't care about to explain one portrait he did. He was tiresome. They should have chosen someone else. There are any number of English Presenters I'd much rather have listened to.",1497916800,2,409,4.774647887323944
7712589,3,B01DJ63U12,"One other commentator summed my view up quite well:  "" I suppose this man couldn't get over what the nuns taught him at the private school he attended, but nevertheless that is not particularly relevant to an objective evaluation of the facts and a balanced view of the historical situation as a whole.""  England was in the throes of its breakout as a great notion.  Throwing off the yoke of the Papacy along with Germany, both countries still are very relevant today but not so much for those (Spain, Italy, France) staying subjugated to the Pope.  Yes Henry VIII was violent but that was necessary to get out from under the yoke of Rome.  He broke those bonds for whatever reason. Elizabeth I, a Protestant, oversaw some of the greatest achievements in England's history.
The talking head made this about himself and how great the Catholic Church is and totally denigrates the the Protestant's very positive influence of the growth of great nations.",1497744000,2,951,4.809815950920245
7712590,4,B01DJ63U12,"Absolutely fascinating--particularly when looked at as the narrator has done and also how, if interpreted correctly (and I must believe that is definitely the case by Holbein (the Younger); the genitor, of all this extremely informative artwork. I knew immediately who it was, that was first drawn to our collective attention in the very first portrait of the much younger (not to mention profoundly slimmer)--had to be Henry V111!  I  have been drawn to all of European history since early childhood and have been so because history itself draws me in and almost literally holds me (and hopefully holds most of us all, in the palm of its proverbial & powerful hand). Henry the Horrible (not the 8th!) will always serve as one of the all-time-greatest examples of power being corruptive, if not altogether totally corrupting! of our entire history as humans on this planet! He always will be such!",1497225600,2,897,4.973333333333334
7712591,4,B01DJ63U12,Interesting and insightful.,1496707200,,27,8.333333333333334
7712592,5,B01DJ63U12,"Every documentary I have watched by Waldemar Januszczak has been top notch.  I love his style, his depth of knowledge of art history, and how he breaks down a painting to really explain what the amateur would seldom notice.  This documentary on Holbein is no exception - just outstanding work!",1496534400,3,293,4.84
7712593,5,B01DJ63U12,"Not many historical art documentaries are as interesting as this one, so if you are just starting your journey into the world of Renaissance art, this is a great first movie! Plenty of interesting characters are presented in great detail and the narrator even adds in how his own life was affected by the revelation of the art that this man created. Such masterful work, Holbein holds his own to some extent in this age torn asunder by religious ferocity.",1496102400,2,455,4.7
7712594,4,B01DJ63U12,"Worth a watch for sure. In regards to the reviewers that criticize the ""narrator,"" Mr. Januszczak, the film's point sails well above their heads. Beside being the film's writer and director -- he is an art critic -- and thus his POV is necessary for him to do his job. Complaining about his voice, gait or waist size is pedantic at best. Sit back, watch it and enjoy his entertaining slice of Tudor England through the prism of Holbein's brush. If you do, you will be rewarded with an interesting and entertaining portrait of a man, his art and the times in which he painted.",1494460800,5,575,4.485714285714286
7712595,5,B01DJ63U12,"I gave this 5 stars, for the way in which is was presented (narrated) and filmed. It was History in beautiful portraits. The upbeat personality of the presenter made this worth watching more than once!",1494115200,2,201,4.771428571428571
7712596,1,B01DJ63U12,"The classic example of an awful, self obsessed, on-screen narrator ruining an otherwise interesting documentary.  I defy you to watch more than twenty minutes minutes of this POS.",1493596800,3,179,5.392857142857143
7712597,5,B01DJ63U12,"Excellent documentary. I had just watched ""Wolf Hall"" and this popped up as a recommendation.

I'm glad. I've been curious about Holbein for most of my adult life, yet never tried to learn about him.

For those who didn't enjoy Mr. Januszczak's narration, I can kind of understand. But I've watched several of his art documentaries on another streaming service that begins with ""a,"" from the UK, and enjoyed them all. I was happy to see that he was behind this documentary. He offers a penetrating and highly informed presentation of his art subjects, whatever they might be. Enough that I looked for more on YouTube after I watched the first batch.

He doesn't disappoint here. He builds his subject in a long, slow crescendo, ending in a masterly and thoroughly inspiring interpretation of ""The Ambassadors."" He provides a comfortable balance between history, historical context, and his own way of looking at Holbein's art.

Just wish there had been more paintings to see.",1493510400,4,975,4.96319018404908
7712598,2,B01DJ63U12,"The style and voice of the narrator are so annoying, I struggles to watch passed 10 minutes. Apart from that, the narrator overshadows the characters he is describing by drawing too much attention towards himself. It was very distractive. I will try to find a story of the Holbein told by somebody else.",1493510400,2,303,4.735849056603773

7712600,3,B01DJ63U12,"You learn a lot about Holbein's life and paintings but it is hard to enjoy this documentary because of the narrator, a obnoxious, fatty little man with the unpleasant, annoying, irritating high pitched voice. You could perhaps stand him if he did not speak so much nonsense. ""Holbein made the Tudors"", ""We only know them because of Holbein"".  I am sure the producers cab do better next time.",1490054400,2,391,4.75

7712603,4,B01DJ63U12,"Waldemar Januszczak does not have a relaxing or engaging voice or presence. Get past that, and enjoy this great documentary on one of history's most recognized painters! Holbein's work is amazing and worth viewing in this documentary format.",1487548800,,241,5.368421052631579

7712629,4,B01DJ63U12,"Very Intersting documentary on the artist, Hans Holbein who painted the most familiar portrait of Henry VIII as well as Thomas More, and Cromwell.

7712631,5,B01DJ63U12,"This is an excellent overview of Holbein's work and it is suitable for those just discovering him and those that are more than familiar with his amazing talents.  It is well-paced and the presenter is very approachable, knowledgeable and entertaining.  Parents may wish to screen it before sharing it with their children, but I do not recall anything that was particularly rude or vulgar.",1485734400,,388,5.046875
7712632,4,B01DJ63U12,Interesting to learn how Holbein became the portrait artist for Henry 8th and how he learned to manage being in the court and the country at that time.  Fascinating history of his life and how he transformed his primary art focus from religious works to portraits and how he made some political statements through his art.  His art was genius.,1485734400,,343,4.7

7712643,5,B01DJ63U12,"I greatly enjoyed this documentary! The narrator's use of humor and personal interest in Holbein brings the story of Henry VIII's court painter to life. His discussion of Holbein's paintings of Sir Thomas More and Thomas Cromwell are particularly noteworthy, as is his interpretation of ""The Ambassadors."" The production is an excellent portrayal of a figure in Tudor history who tends to be overlooked.",1485388800,,403,5.3125

7712662,5,B01DJ63U12,"An engrossing, insightful, and humorous look at Holbein's life. Waldemar's style is funny (he has the habit of walking into establishing shots and planting his feet in a pose reminiscent of the actors in an episode of Black Adder) but clearly passionate about his topic. It made me look for more of his work (both Holbein's and Waldemar's). Highly recommended!",1484784000,,360,5.016666666666667

This short, one-hour documentary goes well beyond Holbein's famous portraits of Henry VIII, Anne of Cleaves, et al.  For one thing, I finally 'get it' with regards to his ""The Ambassadors.""

7712704,3,B01DJ63U12,"You will learn a bit about Holbein's work in this documentary, but it almost goes out of its way to reveal very little about him as a person. For example, when Holbein returns from London to Basel in 1526, the narrator mentions that he has a wife and two children there. Wait--when did he get married? When did he father two children? And then just as quickly, Holbein's family is ignored again. The documentary also curiously chooses to show invariably young, pretty ladies looking at Holbein's paintings, so when the narrator talks about attractive women, you don't know whether he means the subjects of the paintings or the ladies looking at them. The narrator also has a strange habit of talking while facing away from the camera and often while actually walking away from it. He also makes some curious statements, such as this one of Catherine Parr: ""There is no Holbein portrait of her, so we have no idea what she looked like."" Yet a quick glance at Wikipedia, for example, turns up multiple portraits of her, so, yes, we do have some idea of what she looked like. He also calls Henry VIII ""the terrible"" multiple times, but that is not a proper epithet for him. Overall, this documentary is OK if you want a quick overview of Holbein's work, but there are quite a few areas where it is wanting.",1484006400,2,1303,4.5965665236051505

7712723,3,B01DJ63U12,Possibly If you are considering this video you are familiar with the Tudor legacy.  You have heard of Henry VIII and his six wives at the least and maybe have read in detail of the entire Tudor period. So  Holbein's paintings of the clan spark your interest.  That was my thinking when I happened upon this title in my Prime videos.  I enjoyed the background information regarding Holbein and the perspective regarding his portraits of the Tudors and their ilk. However the narrators' style was often excruciatingly slow and dramatic.  Overall the subject matter could have been covered in half the time.  Probably worth a viewing if you are not in an impatient mood.,1483574400,,667,4.807017543859649

The movie was great and it brought that historic period to life, but then having watched Holbein, a wonderful document that depicted not only the life of the artist...but a broader view of that period. The artist's work is beautiful and the way he painted all of the important people of the time was see inspiring. I will purchase this movie.",1483488000,,512,4.829545454545454

7712737,5,B01DJ63U12,"I learned a lot about Holbein and the sacrifices he had to make in order to keep working as an artist in the 16th century. I'd never thought before about how his work was so instrumental in the popularization of the Tudors throughout the centuries...the 1500s equivalent to present day social media.

I'm still on the fence about Thomas More, whom I admired from his portrayal in ""A Man for All Seasons,"" and despised in ""Wolf Hall."" Waldemar Januszczak helped me see him in a more balanced way, and with the history of Holbein, helped me realize why I cared at all.

Januszczak is funny, smart and so down to earth. I really enjoyed this. Plan to watch more.",1483401600,,659,4.529411764705882

I suppose one could google or wikipedia a lot of that biographical information, but it was presented in an entertaining way here. On the minus side: Didn't like the strong bias in this documentary-- was very anti-Tudor in a global sense (based on a few events) without trying to weigh in a bigger picture of the 16th century as a whole and that dynasty's contributions to it. I suppose this man couldn't get over what the nuns taught him at the private school he attended, but nevertheless that is not particularly relevant to an objective evaluation of the facts and a balanced view of the historical situation as a whole.

As historians try to rewrite history, the Januszczak lets the paintings tell the real truth behind the makers and shakers during the reign of Henry VIII.

Poor Katherine Parr got to finally marry her beloved after Henry's death, but he didn't seem to care that much about her, and the fact that nobody knows  very much about their daughter is sad.

He gets in the way of the subject matter. Literally. There are shots where he's standing in front of the paintings and then steps out of the way to reveal the work. It's a gimmick that doesn't work.

7713000,1,B01DJ63U12,"I love the art of Hans Holbein. I have always been deeply fascinated by his unique historical vantage point, his dazzling technical virtuosity and startling artistic honesty. I wish this movie had been about him, about the Tudors, and their interaction, but it is not. The first few minutes unfurls normally enough -- a bit boring... quirky, distracting sub-par production... but with some promising background information and a look at a few of Holbein's famous works. Quite soon, however, another view-point overtakes the narrative: religious hate. The narrator is hot to re-litigate the religious strife of that long ago time, and appropriate Holbein's work as his weapon. By two-thirds of the way through the film is not about art at all.  The narrator is literally poking and pounding a bible, twisting facts freely and flinging hate. I'm willing to be entertained by the odd crank, but this fell short there too.  Really, I came for the art, so I left. This is a vanity film: unattractive, personally indulgent and boring as your drunken uncle's ranting at Thanksgiving.  It is the very last thing we need right now. Steer clear.",1481068800,5,1135,4.994708994708994

Waldemar Januszczak, was extremely effective in arguing his central thesis--that Henry VIII and those who surrounded him are better remembered because of Holbein's ability to capture their vividness/personality on canvas.  Januszczak's ebullient personality (not dissimilar, I think, from that of Henry VIII himself) conveying a magnetic enthusiasm for his subject, along with his expertise as a respected art critic, enhanced his subject, including the broader scope of Holbein's historical context.

He's definitely a departure from the stuffy, academic BBC presenters of yesteryear.  As to the show, well... it's full of interesting details about the art and times of Holbein and the people he encountered and painted.  Since I have never had the opportunity to see the originals, this was the next best thing.  And, oh... those paintings!

The narrator strives for a light hearted point of view of how Holbein left his family in Germany in order to be an underpaid skilled artisan for Henry VIII. I'm sure Holbein produced more oil paintings and sketches than shown in this film  I had to chuckle a few times out loud at the narrator's side jokes. Nevertheless, he made his points: Holbein was a very great artist, in spite of the unfortunate times in which he lived. One other fact I learned: There's no one place that holds all of Holbein's work. Now, to go check out a few of the other videos on Holbein in YouTube. Maybe they'll share what else he produced?",1478822400,35,678,4.467741935483871

Luther and Zwingli, after numerous debates, determined they had irreconcilable differences over the question of transubstantiation. Zwingli's friend and ally, Johannes Oecolampadius, was the reformer in Basel. Waldemar is a historian and that little bit of history is 1) kind of important, 2) easy to research and get right.

Why do BBC and other makers of documentaries in Britain insist upon putting the hosts in front of the camera so much when they are not the story? And they are almost always annoying.
 I almost avoid anything that comes from England about history in a series for this reason...

Still this is very much worth one's time if you can screen out the black clothed presenter.

Holbein was not familiar to me as a name or an artist, but... all of his art was and certainly... the presenter's observations is true, that art can be effectively very political... and mold historical perspective... and that especially includes portraiture.",1478563200,6,660,4.771929824561403
