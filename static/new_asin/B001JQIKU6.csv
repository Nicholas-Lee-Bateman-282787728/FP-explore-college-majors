8446451,5,B001JQIKU6,"This collection of interviews is essential viewing for budding screenwriters. My favorite interviews are with Phil Rosenthal (EVERYBODY LOVES RAYMOND) and Doug Ellin (ENTOURAGE). The Write Environment delves into the personal stories of each screenwriter, how they got their start, what their writing process is like, and advice for aspiring screenwriters. I also picked up Phil Rosenthal's book, ""You're Lucky You're Funny"" as a used book on Amazon.com for $3.16, including shipping. Highly recommended.",1320192000,3,504,5.824324324324325
