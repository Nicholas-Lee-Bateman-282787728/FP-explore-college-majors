8155257,1,B00005RERD,"I had ordered this DVD so I could show it to my students who are reading O Henry stories.  I was disappointed; the acting is so amateur; and the ""frame"" for presenting the stories is so corny.  So I hunted for the 1951 film ""O Henry's Full House"" (Fred Allen, Marilyn Monroe) and finally found it on eBay.  It may be 50 years older, but it's much better!",1089849600,14,354,4.176470588235294
