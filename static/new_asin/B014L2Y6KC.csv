8731237,5,B014L2Y6KC,"I actually like this movie very much!!! The scenes where it is filmed is creepy. The plot is good and i always loved Frank Finley. Sad that Suzanna Leigh passed away in Dec, 2017.",1522972800,,179,4.294117647058823
8731238,4,B014L2Y6KC,"I just wanted to vote favorably for this film and Blu and chuck in a few additional words . I own this film in no less than several formats . As part of the triple feature Cult Horror Collection along with The Skull and The Man Who Could Cheat Death . That's a spectacular set of Hammer and Amicus offerings but was not where I first saw The Deadly Bees even though I acquired that collection first . I bought an independent copy of Bees as it was so reasonable at the time and watched and was taken with it for all it's modest charms some may regard as demerits or some such thing . Got the Blu now and wouldn't part company with any of the various copies . It's very fun . Granted , it telegraphs it's ""secret"" about mid way through (if not earlier) . It's a keeper though friends (pun intended) . Particularly if you enjoy bee films (The Swarm , etc) .",1463788800,2,855,4.125748502994012
8731239,4,B014L2Y6KC,"Though it starts off in an unpromising manner, with a silly musical performance by the Birds (no, not the Byrds), THE DEADLY BEES turns out to be a surprisingly good mystery-thriller from British production company Amicus, known for its Hammer-quality '60s and '70s horror movies. Robert Bloch co-wrote the screenplay, Oscar-winning cinematographer Freddie Francis directed it, and actress Suzanna Leigh (Elvis's love interest in PARADISE, HAWAIIAN STYLE) stars as a pop singer sent to a remote island to recuperate from an on-camera collapse. She promptly becomes embroiled in a conflict between two rival beekeepers, one of whom has found a way of training his bees to kill on command.

While this movie was riffed in MST3K's ninth season, it's less risible than one would assume; in fact, it generates some genuine suspense as the very small cast is picked off one by one, and the jump cuts -- slightly disorienting in such a staid, typically British type of visual storytelling -- keep things moving quite swiftly.",1448928000,3,1018,5.132530120481928
8731240,3,B014L2Y6KC,"a B film that has some surprises also some corn.
still entertaining and best of all it's on blu ray and I got a good price .",1447804800,,124,3.6296296296296298
8731241,4,B014L2Y6KC,"I do love my British movies, they are so well done even when they do it in an understated way. for all intent and purposes this is a 5 person movie. Each person does there parts perfectly. More mystery than a horror type of movie, the question comes down to who is training bees to attack and these are giant mutant bees or bees from the planet mongo, these are....bees. An overworked singer needs a rest and goes to some small farm for rest. then the trouble begins! is it corny and hokey at times...sure it is but it is also a well acted and well paced and thought out little movie. Even though sometimes you want to scream....really...don't do that or are you really going to do that! Suzanna leigh was never a favorite of mine but she was fine here.",1446940800,3,753,4.309859154929577
8731242,3,B014L2Y6KC,"Anyone who is a fan of ""Mystery Science Theater 3000,"" This is a must. Even without the riffs from the show, It's still an okay movie.",1444262400,7,134,4.1923076923076925
