8021936,5,B0002475PC,"I have watched this documentary about ten times so far. Lord Kitchener is so great. It's an absolute pleasure to watch him perform and even better to see him sit there with just his acoustic guitar and explain about Calypso music. Although the time this was filmed dictated that the music captured on film is mostly Soca, it's still great to watch these legends in action. I'm not a big Calypso Rose fan and could have done without that thread but it's still interesting. An added bonus: whenever my 3-month-old baby is agitated and inconsolable I put this film on and dance with him. He quiets down immediately. I guess he'll be a Calypsonian.",1331251200,6,644,4.657894736842105
