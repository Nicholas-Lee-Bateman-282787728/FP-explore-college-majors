3042615,5,B000ZLUWAM,"I rank this movie to be as good as 'Midway,The Longest Day.'or any war movie that speaks about loyality,duty to country and comradeship. In all of those characteristics,it is absolutely stunning. Considering that the replacement crew members were as young as 15 years old,they knew the mission was a one way ticket,yet they never wavered. The personal interaction between the characters is real and intense and honest,if you're sensitive to the good in us,this story will make you cry. I can't speak on culture,movie making,sub-titles,all that was lost in the story. There was no vivid sex scenes or undue violence. It's 5 Stars.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/2007-Japanese-Drama-Movie-YAMATO-w-English-Subtitle/dp/B000ZLUWAM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">2007 Japanese Drama Movie - YAMATO - w/ English Subtitle</a>",1236384000,9,852,6.417391304347826
3042616,3,B000ZLUWAM,"Being a foreign movie buff, especially Japanese movies...I was pleasantly pleased with Yamato.  The movie was a lot like ""Letters from Iwo Jima"" and if I didn't know better drew quite a bit from the plot.  The scenery and the special effects were decent but somewhat repetitive.  My hats off to the CGI of the ship itself not to mention the gun platform sets.  This would have been better for me if there were actually english subtitles on the disk.  My rudimentary japanese came in handy in a strictly purist sense.  This would have fared better with an english dub.  All in all a good movie.",1235174400,2,593,4.537735849056604
3042617,5,B000ZLUWAM,"I feel like I saw a different movie than some of the reviewers here.  I suppose there was a lot more that could have been done in this movie, but what I saw was a film about the crew of Yamato, how they lived and died in their final days.  In this regard, I thought the movie did a fine job.

If I had to compare movies, I would choose Black Hawk Down.  Geopolitical issues nothwithstanding, the movie was about the sailors.  How they fought and died together as brothers.

I'm a simple man, and I cried watching Yamato.  I saw the film at a festival and the packed crowd of fairly sophisticated movie goers barely had a dry eye in the theater.  The festival was in Hawaii, and the crowd was made up of various ethnicities, so I don't think race was even a factor in how people reacted to the movie.",1203552000,69,799,4.176470588235294
3042618,1,B000ZLUWAM,"I am sure the film's two five star reviewers will quickly launch with a confused attack playing the race/culture card as they have on the other reviewer here who seemed to like this film far more than most Japanese did. They would be wrong to do so or to make any assumptions about 'not understanding Japanese culture' since they do not understand modern Japanese culture in their reviews.

This is a film that caused a great deal of anger in Japan. Not just because of the way it rewrites history that so angered the Chinese. The Yamato is for many in Japan the great ""acceptable"" tragedy of the war (Hiroshima and Nagasaki still carry a stigma to this day). Many Japanese think of it in the same way many Americans think of 9/11 as a moment that changed the way they saw the world. It was the moment the war was publicly lost even if the fighting was to go on. It was the moment the people realised they were expected to die with no hope of victory. Nothing would ever be the same. The survivors stories of the sinking of the ship are heartrending and known to everyone in Japan. This film does not do them justice. It turns a hugely important moment in Japan's history into an imitation American-style war movie. Not even a good war movie. Only two scenes show that this could have been the film the crew of the Yamato deserved. One is when the ship sets out on its final mission and the crew are given lessons in how to die with honour and to let go of their pain and sorrow. The other is when the men realise that their commanders at home who expect them to die will not die themselves. Everything else is a missed chance. Everything else is pure Hollywood. What the Yamato meant and what the Japanese people learned from its destruction are ignored for more cliches, each cliche taking the place of a real tragedy. I expect at least two ""not helpful"" votes for this review but that does not change the low quality of this film.",1199059200,86,1933,4.3844011142061285
3042619,3,B000ZLUWAM,"Leaving a trail of controversy in its insubstantial wake, Yamato turns out not to be the dangerous far right bit of revisionism excusing Japan's conduct in WW2 many Western pundits have claimed but instead a horribly clich&eacute;d attempt to fuse Titanic with Saving Private Ryan and ending up with something distinctly lukewarm instead. Yes, it ignores the realities of the dictatorship on the home front that drove Japan to disaster during its scenes ashore and doesn't seem to have more than a passing interest in historical context (it gives the days and dates but never the rationale behind them), but it does both acknowledge that the war was started by Japanese aggression (though the subtitles curiously date Pearl Harbor as 8th December 1941!) and that not everyone was driven by banzai patriotism (one character only joined up because his family needed the money). There's even some limited superficial discussion about the Bushido code's fallibility being that it prepares people for death where genuine chivalry prepares people for life and the possibility that the crew's pointless deaths will at least kick Japan out of its fatalistic stupidity if future generations learn from its mistakes. But for the most part it opts to take no real stand on anything, aiming to be all things to all demographics. Or, in this case, all clich&eacute;s.

Obsolete before she was even built, in many ways the Yamato is a great metaphor for the impotent stupidity of the Japanese military regime who ordered the destruction of their navy and army from the safety of their bunkers, its unimpressive war record achieving nothing but the death of its crew. Set during the period that Japan was reduced to fighting a defensive war and losing heavily, there's not much in the way of mounting dread as it becomes more and more obvious that the ship's final sortie will be a pointless suicide mission because there's little hope of identifying with any of the cardboard characters among the experienced crew and raw cadets, so that when the inevitable disaster finally strikes you're more of a disinterested observer. For all the Saving Private Ryan camera-work, there's no sense of immediacy or personal involvement to the scenes: the audience is kept firmly outside the film. For the most part the special effects aren't quite up to snuff - not bad enough to be laughable, not good enough to be entirely convincing - and the film often seems horribly studio bound. Unlike Titanic there's never even any real sense of how the ship works or its basic geography, with the Yamato itself remaining an indifferent backdrop rather than a character in itself.

The crew's final shore leave offers a couple of effective vignettes and there are some interesting moments in the last half hour as Japan's defeat and subsequent survivor's guilt are touched upon (though this one gives The Return of the King a run for its money in the most endings stakes), but this is so over-reliant on tapping into local sentiment that it never develops any real resonance for foreign audiences. Horribly over-reliant on the usually excellent Joe Hisaishi's surprisingly derivative and ineffectually sentimental score (think Philippe Sarde's Tess without the power or emotion), in many ways it's like the Yamato itself: big, expensive, redundant and at the end of the day more notable for the way it sank than anything it ever did while it was afloat.

The Chinese 2-disc DVD includes numerous deleted scenes that are, like the film, presented in 2.35:1 widescreen with Japanese soundtrack and an English subtitle option. Trailer and music video are also included in an otherwise somewhat skimpy package.",1196380800,23,3671,5.054455445544554
3042620,5,B000ZLUWAM,"This DVD recounts the story of enlisted crewmen aboard the ill fated IJN Yamato, the largest battleship in history.  The DVD is in Japanese, with English subtitles.  When ordering, make sure that you order the version that is good for all regions, otherwise it will not play in American DVD players.  Region 2 and Region 3 are no good for American DVD players.  The Japanese title is Otoko Tachi No Yamato and is from 2005.  I bought it from the seller nanakiwi on Amazon.com.  This is a good quality DVD, with a clear picture and good sound.  The bonus features are rather skimpy, and are text only.

There is combat in this story, but it is mainly a story of how men deal with a losing war and imminent death.  Secondly, it gives a good recreation of the rather intense and physical discpline that was inherent in the Japanese navy in World War II.

This film is pretty accurate from a military perspective, as the Japanese film makers have gone to great pains to recreate authenticity, even down to how the food was cooked!

The story is told in flashback, as the adopted daughter of one of the few survivors wants to visit the wreck site of Yamato on the 60th anniversary of its sinking.  Later we learn that she scatters his ashes over the site where Yamato was sunk.  The man who drives her there in a small boat is also one of the few survivors of the ship.  During the voyage we learn more about this man and in the end he finally comes to grips with his life and his role aboard the IJN Yamato.

This is definately not a ""rah rah"" pro-nationalist type movie, but a moving human drama about the waste of war, and the people who are devestated by it.  The soundtrack is excellent and the acting is first rate.  I highly recommend it to anyone interested in the Yamato specifically or wartime drama generally.  Viewers who do not know alot of Japan may find it to be instructive as well, since the Japanese view of war and sacrifice offers interesting contrasts to the standard American view.",1196035200,50,1998,4.457300275482094
3042621,5,B000ZLUWAM,"Over acted but you don't often get to see the enemies side like this. Mostly its a story of kids who have to go to war and know they are going to die but its a must have for a student of Showa era Japan. The CG is pretty good but be prepared for some gruesome scenes of the exposed AA platforms of Yamato being strafed by the 0.50's and 20mm cannon of the USN Hellcats, Helldivers, and Avengers.

In a lot of ways the movie explains why this small Island nation attacked a super power it couldn't hope to beat. Hidden in the dialogue is the 16'th century culture that doomed the 20'th century Navy that was the best in the world at the time Yamato was launched.",1498089600,,661,4.124031007751938

Finally!! I was able to get the Blu-Ray on Amazon. The picture and sound is excellent, however, the English Subtitles were a little off at times i.e. one place read that the IJN was defeated by the U.S. Army at Midway . . . really now, but they were sufficient to let one know what in general was going on.  Further, it was delivered much sooner than expected.

I like this movie and wish that I could buy it on Amazon if it is affordable.

Regarding the event. I find it to be a despicable waste of life on the part of the IJN and or the Japanese government of the time; they knew that the crew and ship had absolutely no chance. Some what like the horrid crap that the German military did to those U Boat crews at the close of the war.

3042625,5,B000ZLUWAM,"This is simply put , one of the VERY BEST War Films set in the Pacific War , and especially interesting as it is set from the  Japanese viewpoint .
Yamato"" opens at the in Kure City, where Makiko Uchida is visiting the Yamato Museum in an attempt to understand what her father experienced during his service aboard the Yamato during World War Two. After viewing the museum, which allows the filmmakers to use narration to bring the viewer up to speed on the importance of the Yamato itself, she heads to the Makurazaki Fishermen's Collective to find someone to take her to the spot where the Yamato sank, a journey of 15 hours. The harbormaster turns her away with a laugh so she heads to the waterfront to see if she can find someone willing to take her on the voyage. She meets with about the same amount of success there, however her request is overheard by seventy-five-year-old Katsumi Kamio, a veteran of the Yamato who served under Makiko's father. Eventually Kamio agrees to take Makiko to the spot where the Yamato sank. During their voyage Kamio remembers his time on the Yamato, beginning in 1942. From this point on scenes of Makiko's and Kamio's voyage to the Yamato's grave serve as chapter breaks in the story of Kamio the Younger and his compatriots, including Mamoru Uchida (Makiko's father), Moriwaki, and Karaki when they served aboard the Super Battleship
The Battle scenes at Leyte Gulf , then Okinawa are brutal , but realistic and tell the story of the suicide mission that the Japanese Navy sent this Battleship and the Light Cruiser and only a few Destroyers as escort - I saw this film when it first came out and loved it , and its still really , really good",1485734400,,1684,4.59468438538206

3042628,4,B000ZLUWAM,"A sort of Japanese Band of Brothers, or Generation War, and a valuable look at one of the great disasters (from the Japanese point of view) of the war.  I'm glad I saw it, and I will watch it again and try to keep the characters straight, but the subtitles are a wonder in themselves, and just short of absolutely no help understanding what's going on (the product of a Middle School English class armed with a not-very-good dictionary?).  Rather grainy, and the sub- or super-plot intrudes too much.

3042643,5,B000ZLUWAM,"I was engrossed by this film, its sympathetic treatment of several friends, members of the Imperial Japanese Navy, and crew members of the YAMATO.  While not neglecting the military/action aspects---the war scenes are very realistic portrayed---it is, above all, the human aspect and the interaction of these buddies that captures our attention, helps us identify with their turmoil and misfortunes, and it is this that lifts this movie above the level of a simple ""war movie.""  Highly recommended.",1388188800,3,498,5.371794871794871
3042644,5,B000ZLUWAM,"It was mainly a human drama and as such was a fine movie.  The purely Japanese perspective was really interesting.
  As a avid modeler, I was impressed at the level of detail on the sets they built and all the CGI of the ship in general.  It is not perfect no, but it was really well done,  especially the way they sandbagged the AA guns which I had read about but finding photos was challenging.  To see how they  did it in the film was entirely plausible and fits the descriptions.
the crew fleeing the deck to avoid being killed by the main armament firing was also a accurate and interesting scene.
The last mission was accurate, the other ships in the mission are there , despite one reviewer claiming otherwise they are evident in  many scenes,  several moments of dialog refer to the squadron communicating, and they were quite evident at the end.  So they played a background role but were clearly there...
The violence of war is very graphic in this film, but that too fits descriptions of the US Navy pilots  "" painting the decks red""  all in all it was a excellent film, fun to watch and a great inspiration for WWII enthusiasts.",1384819200,4,1140,4.454106280193237

The Yamato was the largest battleship ever constructed by any nation at the time. I don't want to give the story line away but the fact that the Yamato was sent on her last voyage as a suicide mission is well told in this movie. The effects are superb and the acting is very well performed. I'm just glad they didn't allow English over dubbing of voices. Having the subtitles makes it more interesting.

3042649,5,B000ZLUWAM,"I'm not a naval historian, so any Inaccuracies in this film aren't apparent to me. Having served on two different aircraft carriers in four years, I appreciate that this film got the look and feel of serving aboard a ship down pat. It's nice to see the ""human side"" of the opposing Japanese forces in World War II. The ""book ends"" of the film, set in contemporary times, are extremely well done and add a poignancy to the characters that you meet in the story. I love that the characters we follow on board ship are enlisted men and petty officers-something you don't usually see in big budget naval epics. I love movies like MIDWAY, IN HARMS WAY  and TORA! TORA!TORA!, but they always have Commanding officers and such as the main characters, and we seldom get to see what the ""little guys"" are doing. YAMATO does an excellent job of making you feel like you've just been ""piped aboard"" by the Officer of the Deck, enroute to your first tour of duty as a new recruit aboard this steel behemoth!
Warning: This film can be extremely brutal in scenes, and especially gory during the battle scenes, so it's not recommended for younger children.

At the beginning, you have to navigate over to ""English"" and then ""Resume"" on the menu to get the English sub-titles to appear.  I was distracted during the AA gun position scenes when the triple gun tubes seemed to be flapping around independently.  A precision gun mount would have all three gun tubes fixed in the same direction.  Also, commands were given to aim the guns at a specific direction and elevation.  That's OK for targets at sea, but not in the air.  Planes have to be tracked with direction and elevation continuously changing.",1361145600,3,733,4.716535433070866

3042656,2,B000ZLUWAM,"This movie disappointed me greatly, for many reasons:

1. It was clearly made with a little budget and it shows immediately in the two battle sequences (the battle of Leyte in October 1944 and the final ""Yamato"" sortie during Okinawa campaign). It is especially disappointing for the final fight, when ""Yamato"" and her screen (cruiser ""Yahagi"" and the eight destroyers) faced hundreds of American planes (Avengers armed with torpedoes, Helldivers carrying bombers and Hellcats and Corsairs using their guns and rockets to suppress anti-aircraft guns). Do not expect a fair reconstruction of this apocalyptic fight - all the ""American"" planes look exactly the same, they fly in the same way, they are always hit in the same place, etc. The way the fire of main battery of ""Yamato"" is shown is extremely disappointing - the biggest guns ever mounted on a warship are barely audible and the terrifying effect of their salves is missing in action. The few CGI effects are barely noticeable and it seems that their only reason to be is to figure on the back cover of DVD to encourage (deceive?) the buyers. Oh, and finally, ""Yahagi"" and the destroyers are not even shown during the battle - when in the real story they valiantly and stubbornly stayed with ""Yamato"" to the end, ""Yahagi"" and three destroyers being destroyed in the process. (a fourth destroyer, ""Asashimo"", which was earlier separated from the rest of the group because of engine troubles, met also her fate this day, sinking with all her crew of 326...).

2. The scenario is a subtle mixture of patriotic propaganda and Hallmark family drama, without absolutely any feeling of authenticity. You will not find there any elements of real life of Japanese soldiers and sailors during WWII: the brutality of relations between officers and rank and file (and even more between NCOs and rank and file) is totally absent, you will not find anything about Japanese occupation of conquered countries (even if sailors go out on land in occupied territories), the backbreaking effort of hard daily work on a warship is absent, conflicts between people are barely there, dialogs are incredibly empty of any interesting content, etc. All sailors are squeaky clean, in good health, well fed, well behaved, never having any doubts or even a bad mood, drinking with moderation, never going to a cathouse (and we talk here about 2300 sailors 3000 miles from home!), always volunteering for more work, daily writing letters to the family and aspiring only and exclusively to die for the Emperor.

3. The crucial moments when the operation ""Ten-Go"" (the last sortie against Okinawa) is announced are very poorly shown. In the real history, many high level officers of Imperial Japanese Navy strongly objected against this madness, arguing that ""Yamato"" ""Yahagi"" and the eight destroyers could be better used in the defense of mainland. When the orders were maintained, they requested at least the air cover - which was denied (all available planes were send the same day against the American invasion fleet near Okinawa). There were more protests even after that - but all this tense and tragic situation is barely shown in the movie!

Considering all this, I believe that this movie is UNWORTHY of the tragedy which was ""Yamato"" last battle and the - useless and avoidable - death of 3700 sailors from ""Yamato"", ""Yahagi"", ""Asashimo"", ""Isokaze"", ""Kasumi"" et ""Hamakaze"". I really hope that another movie, better and more realistic, will be made one day. And for that reason, I advise you against buying this film, except if you are a total history freak (like me) and do not mind wasting a couple of bucks and some shelf space on a little, not very good, exotic curiosity.",1283817600,4,3713,4.955056179775281
3042657,3,B000ZLUWAM,"First, I lived in Japan for six years, was in the U.S. Navy, toured the Battleship Mikasa and two U.S. Battleships, and read Admiral Yamamato's biography.
I ordered this DVD with the PBS Nova DVD, ""Sinking the Supership"", which re-uses some of the footage from this film. I'd also read the Wikipedia entry on the Yamato a few times.
With that background and a little knowledge of Japanese, I was able to watch this movie; I thought the CGI was cheap; the whole ships shakes when a small shell hits, but the ship doesn't roll in the sea, or even list when the ship makes a fast turn.
The star of the show, at least for me, was the English subtitles: ""By 1941, Japan controlled Hong Kong, Singapore, Formosa and the Filipino."" About every two minutes, the words on the screen are the opposite of what's going on in the movie. I wondered if they'd sail to Okinawa by way of Denver.
The character ""Uchida"" (right-hand face on the cover displayed here) looks like a Japanese double for Sean Penn. When he barks one-syllable orders in combat, he sounds like Sean Penn, too!

If you liked the movie ""Pearl Harbor"", this is for you. If you preferred ""Tora, Tora, Tora!"", I'd suggest the Nova DVD ""Sinking the Supership"".",1279411200,25,1212,4.559633027522936

If it was re-released with correct subtitling, and new packaging, for the english speaking audience in the US, I think it would be very well received. My wife and I enjoyed seeing a movie that showed the Japanese side of WW2. Showing the human side of the war, from a Japanese standpoint, allows us to understand that no one thinks that they are the bad guys in war. Every side believes that it is in the right. And every side has their reasons for doing what they do. This understanding can help us to see our ""enemies"" as real people, with real feelings, instead of sub-human beings that we should hate and kill. If all sides, in any given dispute, maintained this awareness, perhaps we would fight each other less often, and with less viciousness. Sadly, our tendency is to de-humanize each other, in order to treat each other viciously, supposedly to win. How tragic this is.",1278201600,2,948,4.58235294117647

Realistic and brutally honest about the physical abuse common in the Imperial Japanese armed forces. However for a film with such production values the translation and subtitles are the worst I have ever seen. The English is at times unintelligible. Think of the worst set of Japanese to English instruction you have ever read for a stereo. Now you have the idea.
  I can find better English speaking Japanese going to a DC sushi Bar. The translation is so bad one wonders if it was done by machine? Perhaps it was farmed out as a grade school project.
  Over 5 million Japanese speak English well, they could not hire one of those ?",1276560000,3,738,4.653846153846154
3042660,4,B000ZLUWAM,"""Otoko-tachi no Yamato"" has often been described as ""Titanic"" meets ""Saving Private Ryan.""  While I don't disagree with that assessment I think it overlooks this film's greatness as a rip-roaring naval epic, the likes of which we haven't seen in decades.

Full disclosure: I've been wild about look of battleships since I was a kid.  This movie is such a perfect orgy of battleship sets, props, and special effects that I was destined to adore it even if the characters had been muppets and the sound track had been 1970s elevator music.  Fortunately this blockbuster has a rousing sound track and memorable (though somewhat clichd) characters.  The best part is that at least 80% of the film takes place aboard the Yamato, so the fantastic sets and digital effects dwarf the fleeting warship shots we saw in ""Tora! Tora! Tora!"" and ""In Harm's Way"" and even ""Pearl Harbor.""  If you want to see life aboard a battleship then this is the film for you.

The central plot is historically familiar, following the WWII adventures of the crew of the Japanese battleship Yamato from their first day aboard until the ship's inevitable destruction under the onslaught of American bombers.  As their relationships grow through cruelty and adversity the story is framed within the 2005 story of a woman's quest to connect with the past.  This simple plot arc moves pretty quickly for such a long film.

""Otoko-tachi no Yamato"" is full of the expected clichs, but they didn't bother me.  Unfortunately I was bothered by the English subtitles, which were so poorly translated that they became distracting.  Whoever translated them did not understand English verb tense, number, and pronoun genders.  This caused humorous juxtapositions, such as the beautiful leading lady constantly referred to as ""him.""

For better or worse, the grisly battle scenes pull no punches.  You'll get plenty of guns, fire, explosions, screams, and blood.  In fact the point of the movie seems to be to show the viewer plenty of heroic death scenes.  I will never forget the ocean pouring in as men struggled to save each other, or men out on deck desperately clawing to the wooden planks as the great ship rolled slowly over to meet its doom.

Watch ""Otoko-tachi no Yamato"" with the same buddies you would want with you during ""Saving Private Ryan,"" or better yet deactivate the subtitles and watch with someone who can translate Japanese.  Fans of drama and melodrama will love this epic, but if you want to set the mood for a romantic evening with a woman, then ""Otoko-tachi no Yamato"" is not a good substitute for ""Titanic.""",1275955200,4,2593,4.892448512585812
3042661,3,B000ZLUWAM,"After seeing final battle scene action clips of this film on Youtube, I decided to order this.  I found it
it was a very good movie.

The honor and corporal punishment portions were reinforced in the film.  I liked the way the story was told in flashback format.  I thought the storyline was very well told.  The action scenes were maybe not great compared to
Hanks-Spielberg-Eastwood style, but very good nonetheless.

The movie starts out with a narration of how the Japanese were justified in Pearl Harbor due to oil embargo placed
on them by Allied countries. Seemed to skip over the part where you have to let those countries know you are declaring war first, not the cowardly way they did it. They also rip the US in the narration a couple of other times in the film.

Whoever did the English subtitles must have told the distributor he was bilingual and spoke fluent English...he lied.  It is about 75% good on syntax and grammar.  I think that some parts may be too literal of a translation and it does not come across as intended.",1273190400,2,1039,4.543010752688172

The most obvious flaw in the film are the absolutely risible English subtitles that are so off the mark as to render the film almost incomprehensible.  The device to tie the present and past together just doesn't work, is often confusing and detracts from the narrative.  The acting is wooden which matches the less than convincing model of the ship and the rather obvious use of CGI.  It is hard to understand how such a powerful story could be rendered essentially meaningless.  Credit (or blame) should start with the director and all his enablers.  What this film needed was a coherent and compelling narrative and a director with the vision and sensitivity of a Kurosawa.  In the hands of a Kurosawa this would have been a story for the ages.  As it is, we learn little new about how the Japanese people viewed the Pacific War, the symbolic importance that they attached to the Yamato and why the ship was sent off on its doomed mission.  The Yamato story needs to be told.  Let us hope that we will see that film sometime in the future.  It's too big a story to be ignored.",1271203200,12,1249,4.453744493392071

Again, this movie does not paint a pretty picture of the Japanes Government at the time, showing the mesures they took to ensure victory for Japan, who by the way thought they were losing the war.
Being American, for the first time I had a chance to see that the Japanese had the same feeling that the American's did, they were losing and were never to recover.  Sacrificing one of the largest battleships in the fleet is a desperate mesure, as is dropping a 25 megaton bomb is also a desperate mesure.  This movie proves one thing, that Japan has earned the American's respect!  They were willing to give the last drop of blood for their country and blindly followed an immoral order that would surely lead to their demise.

3042670,3,B000ZLUWAM,"I just recently ordered and finally found time to watch the Japanese production entitled; ""Yamato.""  This film is a depiction of the WWII Japanese battleship that was in route to Okinawa but was spotted and, subsequently sunk by American forces.

I assumed the film I ordered had English subtitles, but with the exception of just two sentences all the other subtitles were in Japanese.  Needless to say, since my efficiency in Japanese is limited to about three words, much of the movies  humanistic story line escaped me.

None the less, the movie opens during modern times and reverts back and forth between 1998 and 1945.  As with many Japanese movies, the acting is at times over-dramatic and rhetorical.  However, I must give the producers a ""well-done' on most of the battle scenes that were (for the most part) extremely realistic.

Despite my ignorance of the language,(and perhaps the remote control), the movie depicted another view of the war, and various facets of the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) that were little known to the Western analysts at the time.

The movie is different and perhaps a little too long but overall, it is entertaining and a good mixture of the human element and the horrors of war...regardless of which side one served.",1237766400,2,1257,4.919431279620853

My hats off to the CGI of the ship itself not to mention the gun platform sets.  This would have been better for me if there were actually english subtitles on the disk.

I suppose there was a lot more that could have been done in this movie, but what I saw was a film about the crew of Yamato, how they lived and died in their final days.  In this regard, I thought the movie did a fine job.

If I had to compare movies, I would choose Black Hawk Down.  Geopolitical issues nothwithstanding, the movie was about the sailors.  How they fought and died together as brothers.

I'm a simple man, and I cried watching Yamato.  I saw the film at a festival and the packed crowd of fairly sophisticated movie goers barely had a dry eye in the theater.  The festival was in Hawaii, and the crowd was made up of various ethnicities, so I don't think race was even a factor in how people reacted to the movie.",1203552000,69,799,4.176470588235294
3277115,1,B000ZLUWAM,"I am sure the film's two five star reviewers will quickly launch with a confused attack playing the race/culture card as they have on the other reviewer here who seemed to like this film far more than most Japanese did. They would be wrong to do so or to make any assumptions about 'not understanding Japanese culture' since they do not understand modern Japanese culture in their reviews.

This is a film that caused a great deal of anger in Japan. Not just because of the way it rewrites history that so angered the Chinese. The Yamato is for many in Japan the great ""acceptable"" tragedy of the war (Hiroshima and Nagasaki still carry a stigma to this day). Many Japanese think of it in the same way many Americans think of 9/11 as a moment that changed the way they saw the world. It was the moment the war was publicly lost even if the fighting was to go on. It was the moment the people realised they were expected to die with no hope of victory. Nothing would ever be the same. The survivors stories of the sinking of the ship are heartrending and known to everyone in Japan. This film does not do them justice. It turns a hugely important moment in Japan's history into an imitation American-style war movie. Not even a good war movie. Only two scenes show that this could have been the film the crew of the Yamato deserved. One is when the ship sets out on its final mission and the crew are given lessons in how to die with honour and to let go of their pain and sorrow. The other is when the men realise that their commanders at home who expect them to die will not die themselves. Everything else is a missed chance. Everything else is pure Hollywood. What the Yamato meant and what the Japanese people learned from its destruction are ignored for more cliches, each cliche taking the place of a real tragedy. I expect at least two ""not helpful"" votes for this review but that does not change the low quality of this film.",1199059200,86,1933,4.3844011142061285
3277116,3,B000ZLUWAM,"Leaving a trail of controversy in its insubstantial wake, Yamato turns out not to be the dangerous far right bit of revisionism excusing Japan's conduct in WW2 many Western pundits have claimed but instead a horribly clich&eacute;d attempt to fuse Titanic with Saving Private Ryan and ending up with something distinctly lukewarm instead. Yes, it ignores the realities of the dictatorship on the home front that drove Japan to disaster during its scenes ashore and doesn't seem to have more than a passing interest in historical context (it gives the days and dates but never the rationale behind them), but it does both acknowledge that the war was started by Japanese aggression (though the subtitles curiously date Pearl Harbor as 8th December 1941!) and that not everyone was driven by banzai patriotism (one character only joined up because his family needed the money). There's even some limited superficial discussion about the Bushido code's fallibility being that it prepares people for death where genuine chivalry prepares people for life and the possibility that the crew's pointless deaths will at least kick Japan out of its fatalistic stupidity if future generations learn from its mistakes. But for the most part it opts to take no real stand on anything, aiming to be all things to all demographics. Or, in this case, all clich&eacute;s.

Obsolete before she was even built, in many ways the Yamato is a great metaphor for the impotent stupidity of the Japanese military regime who ordered the destruction of their navy and army from the safety of their bunkers, its unimpressive war record achieving nothing but the death of its crew. Set during the period that Japan was reduced to fighting a defensive war and losing heavily, there's not much in the way of mounting dread as it becomes more and more obvious that the ship's final sortie will be a pointless suicide mission because there's little hope of identifying with any of the cardboard characters among the experienced crew and raw cadets, so that when the inevitable disaster finally strikes you're more of a disinterested observer. For all the Saving Private Ryan camera-work, there's no sense of immediacy or personal involvement to the scenes: the audience is kept firmly outside the film. For the most part the special effects aren't quite up to snuff - not bad enough to be laughable, not good enough to be entirely convincing - and the film often seems horribly studio bound. Unlike Titanic there's never even any real sense of how the ship works or its basic geography, with the Yamato itself remaining an indifferent backdrop rather than a character in itself.

The crew's final shore leave offers a couple of effective vignettes and there are some interesting moments in the last half hour as Japan's defeat and subsequent survivor's guilt are touched upon (though this one gives The Return of the King a run for its money in the most endings stakes), but this is so over-reliant on tapping into local sentiment that it never develops any real resonance for foreign audiences. Horribly over-reliant on the usually excellent Joe Hisaishi's surprisingly derivative and ineffectually sentimental score (think Philippe Sarde's Tess without the power or emotion), in many ways it's like the Yamato itself: big, expensive, redundant and at the end of the day more notable for the way it sank than anything it ever did while it was afloat.

The Chinese 2-disc DVD includes numerous deleted scenes that are, like the film, presented in 2.35:1 widescreen with Japanese soundtrack and an English subtitle option. Trailer and music video are also included in an otherwise somewhat skimpy package.",1196380800,23,3671,5.054455445544554
3277117,5,B000ZLUWAM,"This DVD recounts the story of enlisted crewmen aboard the ill fated IJN Yamato, the largest battleship in history.  The DVD is in Japanese, with English subtitles.  When ordering, make sure that you order the version that is good for all regions, otherwise it will not play in American DVD players.  Region 2 and Region 3 are no good for American DVD players.  The Japanese title is Otoko Tachi No Yamato and is from 2005.  I bought it from the seller nanakiwi on Amazon.com.  This is a good quality DVD, with a clear picture and good sound.  The bonus features are rather skimpy, and are text only.

There is combat in this story, but it is mainly a story of how men deal with a losing war and imminent death.  Secondly, it gives a good recreation of the rather intense and physical discpline that was inherent in the Japanese navy in World War II.

This film is pretty accurate from a military perspective, as the Japanese film makers have gone to great pains to recreate authenticity, even down to how the food was cooked!

The story is told in flashback, as the adopted daughter of one of the few survivors wants to visit the wreck site of Yamato on the 60th anniversary of its sinking.  Later we learn that she scatters his ashes over the site where Yamato was sunk.  The man who drives her there in a small boat is also one of the few survivors of the ship.  During the voyage we learn more about this man and in the end he finally comes to grips with his life and his role aboard the IJN Yamato.

This is definately not a ""rah rah"" pro-nationalist type movie, but a moving human drama about the waste of war, and the people who are devestated by it.  The soundtrack is excellent and the acting is first rate.  I highly recommend it to anyone interested in the Yamato specifically or wartime drama generally.  Viewers who do not know alot of Japan may find it to be instructive as well, since the Japanese view of war and sacrifice offers interesting contrasts to the standard American view.",1196035200,50,1998,4.457300275482094

Finally!! I was able to get the Blu-Ray on Amazon. The picture and sound is excellent, however, the English Subtitles were a little off at times i.e. one place read that the IJN was defeated by the U.S. Army at Midway . . . really now, but they were sufficient to let one know what in general was going on.  Further, it was delivered much sooner than expected.

I like this movie and wish that I could buy it on Amazon if it is affordable.

Regarding the event. I find it to be a despicable waste of life on the part of the IJN and or the Japanese government of the time; they knew that the crew and ship had absolutely no chance. Some what like the horrid crap that the German military did to those U Boat crews at the close of the war.

Yamato"" opens at the in Kure City, where Makiko Uchida is visiting the Yamato Museum in an attempt to understand what her father experienced during his service aboard the Yamato during World War Two. After viewing the museum, which allows the filmmakers to use narration to bring the viewer up to speed on the importance of the Yamato itself, she heads to the Makurazaki Fishermen's Collective to find someone to take her to the spot where the Yamato sank, a journey of 15 hours. The harbormaster turns her away with a laugh so she heads to the waterfront to see if she can find someone willing to take her on the voyage. She meets with about the same amount of success there, however her request is overheard by seventy-five-year-old Katsumi Kamio, a veteran of the Yamato who served under Makiko's father. Eventually Kamio agrees to take Makiko to the spot where the Yamato sank. During their voyage Kamio remembers his time on the Yamato, beginning in 1942. From this point on scenes of Makiko's and Kamio's voyage to the Yamato's grave serve as chapter breaks in the story of Kamio the Younger and his compatriots, including Mamoru Uchida (Makiko's father), Moriwaki, and Karaki when they served aboard the Super Battleship

While not neglecting the military/action aspects---the war scenes are very realistic portrayed---it is, above all, the human aspect and the interaction of these buddies that captures our attention, helps us identify with their turmoil and misfortunes, and it is this that lifts this movie above the level of a simple ""war movie.""

3277141,5,B000ZLUWAM,"It was mainly a human drama and as such was a fine movie.  The purely Japanese perspective was really interesting.
  As a avid modeler, I was impressed at the level of detail on the sets they built and all the CGI of the ship in general.  It is not perfect no, but it was really well done,  especially the way they sandbagged the AA guns which I had read about but finding photos was challenging.  To see how they  did it in the film was entirely plausible and fits the descriptions.
the crew fleeing the deck to avoid being killed by the main armament firing was also a accurate and interesting scene.
The last mission was accurate, the other ships in the mission are there , despite one reviewer claiming otherwise they are evident in  many scenes,  several moments of dialog refer to the squadron communicating, and they were quite evident at the end.  So they played a background role but were clearly there...
The violence of war is very graphic in this film, but that too fits descriptions of the US Navy pilots  "" painting the decks red""  all in all it was a excellent film, fun to watch and a great inspiration for WWII enthusiasts.",1384819200,4,1140,4.454106280193237

Having served on two different aircraft carriers in four years, I appreciate that this film got the look and feel of serving aboard a ship down pat. It's nice to see the ""human side"" of the opposing Japanese forces in World War II. The ""book ends"" of the film, set in contemporary times, are extremely well done and add a poignancy to the characters that you meet in the story. I love that the characters we follow on board ship are enlisted men and petty officers-something you don't usually see in big budget naval epics. I love movies like MIDWAY, IN HARMS WAY  and TORA! TORA!TORA!, but they always have Commanding officers and such as the main characters, and we seldom get to see what the ""little guys"" are doing. YAMATO does an excellent job of making you feel like you've just been ""piped aboard"" by the Officer of the Deck, enroute to your first tour of duty as a new recruit aboard this steel behemoth!
Warning: This film can be extremely brutal in scenes, and especially gory during the battle scenes, so it's not recommended for younger children.

At the beginning, you have to navigate over to ""English"" and then ""Resume"" on the menu to get the English sub-titles to appear.  I was distracted during the AA gun position scenes when the triple gun tubes seemed to be flapping around independently.  A precision gun mount would have all three gun tubes fixed in the same direction.  Also, commands were given to aim the guns at a specific direction and elevation.  That's OK for targets at sea, but not in the air.  Planes have to be tracked with direction and elevation continuously changing.",1361145600,3,733,4.716535433070866

3277153,2,B000ZLUWAM,"This movie disappointed me greatly, for many reasons:

1. It was clearly made with a little budget and it shows immediately in the two battle sequences (the battle of Leyte in October 1944 and the final ""Yamato"" sortie during Okinawa campaign). It is especially disappointing for the final fight, when ""Yamato"" and her screen (cruiser ""Yahagi"" and the eight destroyers) faced hundreds of American planes (Avengers armed with torpedoes, Helldivers carrying bombers and Hellcats and Corsairs using their guns and rockets to suppress anti-aircraft guns). Do not expect a fair reconstruction of this apocalyptic fight - all the ""American"" planes look exactly the same, they fly in the same way, they are always hit in the same place, etc. The way the fire of main battery of ""Yamato"" is shown is extremely disappointing - the biggest guns ever mounted on a warship are barely audible and the terrifying effect of their salves is missing in action. The few CGI effects are barely noticeable and it seems that their only reason to be is to figure on the back cover of DVD to encourage (deceive?) the buyers. Oh, and finally, ""Yahagi"" and the destroyers are not even shown during the battle - when in the real story they valiantly and stubbornly stayed with ""Yamato"" to the end, ""Yahagi"" and three destroyers being destroyed in the process. (a fourth destroyer, ""Asashimo"", which was earlier separated from the rest of the group because of engine troubles, met also her fate this day, sinking with all her crew of 326...).

2. The scenario is a subtle mixture of patriotic propaganda and Hallmark family drama, without absolutely any feeling of authenticity. You will not find there any elements of real life of Japanese soldiers and sailors during WWII: the brutality of relations between officers and rank and file (and even more between NCOs and rank and file) is totally absent, you will not find anything about Japanese occupation of conquered countries (even if sailors go out on land in occupied territories), the backbreaking effort of hard daily work on a warship is absent, conflicts between people are barely there, dialogs are incredibly empty of any interesting content, etc. All sailors are squeaky clean, in good health, well fed, well behaved, never having any doubts or even a bad mood, drinking with moderation, never going to a cathouse (and we talk here about 2300 sailors 3000 miles from home!), always volunteering for more work, daily writing letters to the family and aspiring only and exclusively to die for the Emperor.

3. The crucial moments when the operation ""Ten-Go"" (the last sortie against Okinawa) is announced are very poorly shown. In the real history, many high level officers of Imperial Japanese Navy strongly objected against this madness, arguing that ""Yamato"" ""Yahagi"" and the eight destroyers could be better used in the defense of mainland. When the orders were maintained, they requested at least the air cover - which was denied (all available planes were send the same day against the American invasion fleet near Okinawa). There were more protests even after that - but all this tense and tragic situation is barely shown in the movie!

Considering all this, I believe that this movie is UNWORTHY of the tragedy which was ""Yamato"" last battle and the - useless and avoidable - death of 3700 sailors from ""Yamato"", ""Yahagi"", ""Asashimo"", ""Isokaze"", ""Kasumi"" et ""Hamakaze"". I really hope that another movie, better and more realistic, will be made one day. And for that reason, I advise you against buying this film, except if you are a total history freak (like me) and do not mind wasting a couple of bucks and some shelf space on a little, not very good, exotic curiosity.",1283817600,4,3713,4.955056179775281
3277154,3,B000ZLUWAM,"First, I lived in Japan for six years, was in the U.S. Navy, toured the Battleship Mikasa and two U.S. Battleships, and read Admiral Yamamato's biography.
I ordered this DVD with the PBS Nova DVD, ""Sinking the Supership"", which re-uses some of the footage from this film. I'd also read the Wikipedia entry on the Yamato a few times.
With that background and a little knowledge of Japanese, I was able to watch this movie; I thought the CGI was cheap; the whole ships shakes when a small shell hits, but the ship doesn't roll in the sea, or even list when the ship makes a fast turn.
The star of the show, at least for me, was the English subtitles: ""By 1941, Japan controlled Hong Kong, Singapore, Formosa and the Filipino."" About every two minutes, the words on the screen are the opposite of what's going on in the movie. I wondered if they'd sail to Okinawa by way of Denver.
The character ""Uchida"" (right-hand face on the cover displayed here) looks like a Japanese double for Sean Penn. When he barks one-syllable orders in combat, he sounds like Sean Penn, too!

If you liked the movie ""Pearl Harbor"", this is for you. If you preferred ""Tora, Tora, Tora!"", I'd suggest the Nova DVD ""Sinking the Supership"".",1279411200,25,1212,4.559633027522936

If it was re-released with correct subtitling, and new packaging, for the english speaking audience in the US, I think it would be very well received. My wife and I enjoyed seeing a movie that showed the Japanese side of WW2. Showing the human side of the war, from a Japanese standpoint, allows us to understand that no one thinks that they are the bad guys in war. Every side believes that it is in the right. And every side has their reasons for doing what they do. This understanding can help us to see our ""enemies"" as real people, with real feelings, instead of sub-human beings that we should hate and kill. If all sides, in any given dispute, maintained this awareness, perhaps we would fight each other less often, and with less viciousness. Sadly, our tendency is to de-humanize each other, in order to treat each other viciously, supposedly to win. How tragic this is.",1278201600,2,948,4.58235294117647

Realistic and brutally honest about the physical abuse common in the Imperial Japanese armed forces. However for a film with such production values the translation and subtitles are the worst I have ever seen. The English is at times unintelligible. Think of the worst set of Japanese to English instruction you have ever read for a stereo. Now you have the idea.
  I can find better English speaking Japanese going to a DC sushi Bar. The translation is so bad one wonders if it was done by machine? Perhaps it was farmed out as a grade school project.
  Over 5 million Japanese speak English well, they could not hire one of those ?",1276560000,3,738,4.653846153846154
3277157,4,B000ZLUWAM,"""Otoko-tachi no Yamato"" has often been described as ""Titanic"" meets ""Saving Private Ryan.""  While I don't disagree with that assessment I think it overlooks this film's greatness as a rip-roaring naval epic, the likes of which we haven't seen in decades.

Full disclosure: I've been wild about look of battleships since I was a kid.  This movie is such a perfect orgy of battleship sets, props, and special effects that I was destined to adore it even if the characters had been muppets and the sound track had been 1970s elevator music.  Fortunately this blockbuster has a rousing sound track and memorable (though somewhat clichd) characters.  The best part is that at least 80% of the film takes place aboard the Yamato, so the fantastic sets and digital effects dwarf the fleeting warship shots we saw in ""Tora! Tora! Tora!"" and ""In Harm's Way"" and even ""Pearl Harbor.""  If you want to see life aboard a battleship then this is the film for you.

The central plot is historically familiar, following the WWII adventures of the crew of the Japanese battleship Yamato from their first day aboard until the ship's inevitable destruction under the onslaught of American bombers.  As their relationships grow through cruelty and adversity the story is framed within the 2005 story of a woman's quest to connect with the past.  This simple plot arc moves pretty quickly for such a long film.

""Otoko-tachi no Yamato"" is full of the expected clichs, but they didn't bother me.  Unfortunately I was bothered by the English subtitles, which were so poorly translated that they became distracting.  Whoever translated them did not understand English verb tense, number, and pronoun genders.  This caused humorous juxtapositions, such as the beautiful leading lady constantly referred to as ""him.""

For better or worse, the grisly battle scenes pull no punches.  You'll get plenty of guns, fire, explosions, screams, and blood.  In fact the point of the movie seems to be to show the viewer plenty of heroic death scenes.  I will never forget the ocean pouring in as men struggled to save each other, or men out on deck desperately clawing to the wooden planks as the great ship rolled slowly over to meet its doom.

Watch ""Otoko-tachi no Yamato"" with the same buddies you would want with you during ""Saving Private Ryan,"" or better yet deactivate the subtitles and watch with someone who can translate Japanese.  Fans of drama and melodrama will love this epic, but if you want to set the mood for a romantic evening with a woman, then ""Otoko-tachi no Yamato"" is not a good substitute for ""Titanic.""",1275955200,4,2593,4.892448512585812
3277158,3,B000ZLUWAM,"After seeing final battle scene action clips of this film on Youtube, I decided to order this.  I found it
it was a very good movie.

The honor and corporal punishment portions were reinforced in the film.  I liked the way the story was told in flashback format.  I thought the storyline was very well told.  The action scenes were maybe not great compared to
Hanks-Spielberg-Eastwood style, but very good nonetheless.

The movie starts out with a narration of how the Japanese were justified in Pearl Harbor due to oil embargo placed
on them by Allied countries. Seemed to skip over the part where you have to let those countries know you are declaring war first, not the cowardly way they did it. They also rip the US in the narration a couple of other times in the film.

Whoever did the English subtitles must have told the distributor he was bilingual and spoke fluent English...he lied.  It is about 75% good on syntax and grammar.  I think that some parts may be too literal of a translation and it does not come across as intended.",1273190400,2,1039,4.543010752688172

The most obvious flaw in the film are the absolutely risible English subtitles that are so off the mark as to render the film almost incomprehensible.  The device to tie the present and past together just doesn't work, is often confusing and detracts from the narrative.  The acting is wooden which matches the less than convincing model of the ship and the rather obvious use of CGI.  It is hard to understand how such a powerful story could be rendered essentially meaningless.  Credit (or blame) should start with the director and all his enablers.  What this film needed was a coherent and compelling narrative and a director with the vision and sensitivity of a Kurosawa.  In the hands of a Kurosawa this would have been a story for the ages.  As it is, we learn little new about how the Japanese people viewed the Pacific War, the symbolic importance that they attached to the Yamato and why the ship was sent off on its doomed mission.  The Yamato story needs to be told.  Let us hope that we will see that film sometime in the future.  It's too big a story to be ignored.",1271203200,12,1249,4.453744493392071

Again, this movie does not paint a pretty picture of the Japanes Government at the time, showing the mesures they took to ensure victory for Japan, who by the way thought they were losing the war.
Being American, for the first time I had a chance to see that the Japanese had the same feeling that the American's did, they were losing and were never to recover.  Sacrificing one of the largest battleships in the fleet is a desperate mesure, as is dropping a 25 megaton bomb is also a desperate mesure.  This movie proves one thing, that Japan has earned the American's respect!  They were willing to give the last drop of blood for their country and blindly followed an immoral order that would surely lead to their demise.

I assumed the film I ordered had English subtitles, but with the exception of just two sentences all the other subtitles were in Japanese.  Needless to say, since my efficiency in Japanese is limited to about three words, much of the movies  humanistic story line escaped me.

None the less, the movie opens during modern times and reverts back and forth between 1998 and 1945.  As with many Japanese movies, the acting is at times over-dramatic and rhetorical.  However, I must give the producers a ""well-done' on most of the battle scenes that were (for the most part) extremely realistic.

Despite my ignorance of the language,(and perhaps the remote control), the movie depicted another view of the war, and various facets of the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) that were little known to the Western analysts at the time.

8235926,5,B000ZLUWAM,The anti-aircraft machine-cannon were historically accurate.  This 25mm piece was a licensed Hotchkiss weapon.  By late-war standards it was not very good.  Those guys had to to do it with what they had available.  Nobody was doing anything nicely back then.,1519171200,,258,5.219512195121951
8235927,5,B000ZLUWAM,"The largest battleship ever constructed depicted from launching through its demise.  The harsh treatment of enlisted sailors doesn't diminish their loyalty to and eagerness to serve the emperor.  The story is presented by these enlisted crewmen, with interpositions of a trip to the resting place of the ship after its discovery.  The acting may (or may not) be a little over the top for Westerners, but the story is absorbing and well done.  This is the first movie I've seen that depicts the common enlisted sailor on a Japanese ship, instead of the highly ranked officers.",1518480000,,575,4.958333333333333
8235928,3,B000ZLUWAM,It was pretty good. Acting and dialog were a bit hokey at times. The Action and effects were pretty good.,1515024000,,105,4.3
8235929,5,B000ZLUWAM,One of the very best action-packed and historical documentaries I have seen on WWII.  If you are a true history person... you must order this movie.,1514419200,,148,4.6923076923076925

8235932,5,B000ZLUWAM,"I have avoided foreign films due subtitles all my 58 years, no more, films with them are as good as movies you don't need them for, don't be turned off due subtitles, ""Yamato "" ranks up there with Anne Frank's Diary, if your History oriented, this is my 1st subtitle film watched straight threw, I now have six others lined up to watch and will watch having gotten over the stigma of subs, if you felt some thing for Anne Franks story please, please give in to this movie, you will not in any way be turned off due the subtitles unless your still stigmatized with the fact of reading and understanding what your watching, very few places in this one are you over whelmed with reading to understand, a very meaningful true or based on a true story movie, a very much must watch or I wouldn't have written this review",1501027200,,815,4.368421052631579
