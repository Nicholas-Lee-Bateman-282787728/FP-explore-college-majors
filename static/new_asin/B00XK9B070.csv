7170527,5,B00XK9B070,"This movie is exceptional and one of the best ones I have seen in a very long time. Although it had a very limited release and was not highly heard of, i gave it a chance. Boy howdy was I happy I did. Through dialogue and just pure emotion this movie captures what that first true love is like. Everything about this movie is magnificent including the musical score that accompanies it. If you love romance and Anton Yelchin then this is the movie for you! 5 out 5 solid without even the blink of the eye.",1439769600,21,505,4.216494845360825
7170528,5,B00XK9B070,"Well, what else can I say except this must really be THE most overlooked gem of a romantic comedy/drama I've encountered in years?

My jaw dropped to the floor when I noticed that practically nobody around the globe even got a chance to watch it (40 screens in the US and that was it?! No distributor anywhere or what?!), which I believe is a SCANDAL throughout for the writer/director as well as for the actors, all of whom deliver truly genuine and heartbreakingly believable performances.
A true work of delicate art like this, neglected by the film industry as a whole, makes me mad and sad at the same time: if I had the money, I'd promote it myself (and that's not even remotely exaggerated).

They say everyone deserves a second chance, so does this one.",1438041600,48,761,4.588235294117647

7170537,4,B00XK9B070,"This is a well crafted and enjoyable movie about a young American writer and an older French woman who meet in the street in Manhattan. She has an open marriage with her diplomat husband that only allows them to meet between 5 and 7. their relationships becomes intense and the young man talks about marriage. He is struggling to get published and has submitted his work to the New Yorker, and has a bulletin board pull of rejection slips. She encourages him to keep writing. They dine at different places in Manhattan and go to the Guggenheim Museum. The French woman tells him their relationship must end because of their wide age difference. He insists it could work and she insists ti could not, and he finally accepts her decision and finds someone his age, marries her and has a baby. One day he and his wife are visiting the Guggenheim Museum and out comes the French women and her family. They talk briefly and she compliments him on getting published in the New Yorker, as well as getting his book published, and they go on their way mutually happy.

7170538,5,B00XK9B070,I will honestly say this is one of the best movies I have ever seen. So unexpectedly bitter sweet and deeply felt film that you've probably never heard of. Truly beautiful and moving!,1487721600,,183,4.575757575757576

7170540,5,B00XK9B070,"It's not often I thoroughly enjoy a love story, but this is one of those times!  Of course you have to completely overlook the preposterous-ness and silliness of the story.  A writer (Anton Yelchin who often reminds me of a young Michael J. Fox due to his calm yet confident attitude) meets a super cute French lady (played by Berenice Marlohe) on the streets of New York.  At first he's shy and secluded due to being stuck inside all day writing, but he soon finds the courage to cross the street, share a smoke with the woman and have a talk.  Berenice says her name is Arielle and Anton does the unthinkable- he brings up the Little Mermaid since they share the same name.  That's just weird man!  But I suppose the first time we meet the girls we're attracted to we *all* say silly things.  Right guys?

After visiting an art museum, they share a kiss and take a walk through the park.  Prepare yourself- here comes the weirdness.  Berenice's character reveals she has a husband.  Oh wow, looks like you're going home with your tail between your legs Anton... but wait.  No he's not!  Berenice doesn't mind that she's married.  She can still continue to see Anton.  Rejoice!  But wait!  Doesn't this now make the growing relationship awkward?  You bet.  Crazy, but Berenice's husband (Lambert Wilson) doesn't mind that she's seeing Anton either.  It's an open marriage baby.  Those involved can see and do whatever they want.

Speaking of seeing others, Lambert's seeing Olivia Thirlby's character.  Or rather she's a mistress  Yup.  Rather hilariously on my part, when I first saw Olivia at a party Anton was awkwardly invited to, I figured Berenice simply changed her looks, lol.  Silly me!  I thought ""Wow, Berenice suddenly got younger looking!""  Speaking of this party, Anton really thought Berenice's husband was there to beat him up for dating his wife.  No, the husband wants Anton there so he can explain the rules to dating his wife.  To Anton's surprise, even their little kids welcome Anton with open arms.  Now that's just bizarre.

While the story might seem outrageous so far, the story takes it up one more level.  There's important rules at place.  The most important one is that Anton can only see Berenice between the hours of 5 and 7.  Hilarious when Anton first questions Berenice about why this is, he automatically assumes what we all were probably thinking- she's gotta be a prostitute.  She explains why she's in an open marriage, and you know her explanation isn't really that crazy.  I can't quite think it's weird stuff!  Americans need to open their minds basically.

As Anton and Berenice continue to meet up, they eventually meet Anton's parents at a restaurant.  A hilarious moment when Berenice reveals she's 9 years older than Anton, has kids and married.  I like the father's reply to Berenice's comment- ""You could stop Berenice from finishing the first part of that line and find something wrong with it"" or something alone those lines.  Haha!  Anton comes from a Jewish background and his father doesn't particularly care for the French, hence all the war references.

Now this is a SPOILER.  The strict rules of only being allowed to see Berenice between 5 and 7 eventually is the downfall of the relationship.  Berenice simply refuses to change the rules because of the vowels she apparently wrote with her husband.  I understand not wanting to leave her kids to live with Anton, but then again who's to say had she left her husband, and had a custody matter been taken to court, Berenice wouldn't have been granted the kids anyway.  This is why open marriage doesn't work- you're only going to end up choosing one or the other in the end (in this case the husband over Anton, and in Anton's case choosing Berenice over Olivia).

I really enjoy Olivia's character.  While she might not get nearly as much time as Anton and Berenice, she provides encouragement to Anton pertaining to his writing.  The kind of enthusiasm she expresses when it's discovered a book he wrote finally got published is really good.  She takes him to the bookstore where it's on display.  However he's not happy because the writing is about the personal time he spent with Berenice.  Wow, no way I'd have been able to turn away Olivia had she been dancing like that behind me, haha.  Way too irresistibly cute!  Of course it's odd that she would be happy about the book being published and not Berenice.

More SPOILERS- But I suppose what happens after is just as awkward- we see Anton in the future.  He's older and has a wife and kid.  He often sees Berenice walking down the sidewalk but she walks right by not saying hello or even making eye contact with Anton.  How rude!  And when Anton and Berenice finally meet up so he can introduce his wife to Berenice?  Pretty sure the wife wouldn't be happy to meet one of Anton's ex-girlfriends.  Just saying!

I really recommend this movie. It's a love story and it moves at a snails pace, but it's incredibly rich in the storytelling.  Berenice plays a very intelligent, mature and observant person.  She changes Anton, and Anton changes Berenice.  Even the time Anton spends with her kids in the park teaching them baseball is good writing, though perhaps the kids could've been written into the story more.  I think we all knew Lambert's character would react violently at one point, but it's not as bad as you think.  Just a little slap.  Really recommended.",1483488000,,5430,4.721451440768409

7170548,5,B00XK9B070,"Beautiful and heart wrenching. I saw this film two days after Anton Yelchin's death. Sadly (or gratefully), I did not know he passed away when I watched it. Imagine my heartbreak when I learned of his death just hours after watching this lovely movie, I was devastated!! 5 to 7 was simple, funny, romantic, engaging and satisfying. I'm not going into details as some reviewers like to do. Just know this movie is up there with the greatest films I've ever seen, period. The entire cast was brilliant. When I think of Anton Yelchin, I will think of his beautiful portrayal of Brian Bloom. I bought my own copy and loaned it to friends who also loved it.

  as lovers from '5 to 7' is beside the point...it is one of the most tender romantic films that
  should be seen...and the music score is stunning...especially in the last 5 minutes.  That

7170561,5,B00XK9B070,"Anton Yelchin and Bernice Marlohe are the romantic leads and are supported admirably by Glenn Close, Frank Langella, and Olivia Thirlby.  Great comedic material as well as a poignant, unusual storyline.

 I purchased this video from Amazon/Prime/Online about a year ago after having viewed it on Showtime via TWC. I wished to view it again sometime later and found it was NOT available via my TWC Showtime on-demand set-top-box listing. I checked the internet Showtime listings and found it was still in the Showtime library. I contacted TWC and told them that Showtime had this movie available and why couldn't I see it in the TWC/Showtime on demand catalog. After much hand waving TWC admitted that their Showtime catalog was some subset of the actual Showtime listing. I immediately voiced my displeasure and cancelled my TWC SHOWTIME/HBO/STARZ/CINEMAX subscriptions, bought a Fire-TV and subscribed to Showtime on Amazon. As far as I can tell, all Showtime advertised online content is available via Amazon online distribution. To further guarantee that this movie would always be available (I liked it that much) I purchased an electronic copy from Amazon Online.

The point is: please be aware that even though you may be paying the full freight monthly subscription via your cable provider, you may not have access to the entire content possible. Eye opener to me. In my case TWC did not offer an explanation other than they couldn't provide the 5-7 movie. Period. I have been a Time-Warner/Road-Runner customer for nearly 30 years. I always assumed that all the content from the premium services was available as a pass-thru from the local cable provider. I was never aware of any TWC document that said otherwise. Lesson learned.

Thankfully Amazon streaming services are available to fill the cable provider VOID.",1474848000,,1823,5.124579124579125

The subject matter should not be foreign to those who have spent a good amount time with individuals from France or are well read with subject matter on this topic.

7170580,5,B00XK9B070,"I enjoyed this movie, but it made me a bit uncomfortable.  I can't wrap my mind around two gorgeous rich people who have a lot in common feeling the need to find love elsewhere.  It is almost as if they are medieval nobles in a forced marriage, which they are not.  Valery appeared to want his wife to be happy, which certainly indicates love, maybe he doesn't care if she takes a lover because he doesn't want to be a hypocrite?  Maybe Ariele's unlikely love for Brian related to control, she finally had some?  Also, I can't dislike any of the characters although they certainly seemed to be making messes of perfectly enchanted lives.  Perhaps if Valery had spent more energy in his wife's bed than his mistress', then Ariele would have felt loved?  On the other hand, since both parents expose the young children to their adulteries, am I the only one picturing young Marc and Elody with paramours of their own because they may think it's normal?  Maybe the good that came of Brian and Ariele's affair was that Valery and Ariele made the effort to be better to one another, hence they went to her favorite museum even years later as a family, as opposed to strictly only appearing at diplomatic functions together?  I think Ariele and Brian are incredibly nave if they think romping between 5 and 7 represents the depth of a lifelong relationship together.  Also, am I correct in thinking that Valery may have had serial mistresses while Brian was probably Ariele's only lover?  If she was promiscuous, don't you think Valery would have been offended by that behavior?  What did Brian do with the check?",1465689600,3,1607,4.659574468085107

Its interesting setting happens to be in Central Park of New York City. It is definitely entertaining. No question about it. Despite the fact that it consists of many rom-com clichs that are found in many movies with similar themes and with Anton Yelchin's seemingly being awkward playing the role of Brian considering his looks that a gorgeous French woman like Brnice Marlohe will fall head over heels,it still delivered in terms of having a smart story and sensitive direction. Added to that,the themes it presented also were tackled intelligently especially those about couples having different cultures and a young man's journey into maturity particularly when it comes to relationship. It is definitely a must- see for viewers wanting a quality romantic dramedy of a movie.",1456704000,,1177,5.098445595854923

I immediately did a search for next showing and than set my DVR to record. A couple of weeks went by when I decided to cruise through my DVR and see what I had recorded. My eyes fell across 5 to 7 and I remembered the glimpse of the ending. I sat there doing this weeknight and fell in love. I laughed out loud, and I was completely charmed. I read a couple of other reviews and they are correct, this is a ""GEM"". Don't let the subject matter discourage you. This is one of the most sensuous movie you'll ever watch. A movie of true love but more importantly honor and respect. This should have been a book.

What an enjoyable movie and at time comical I enjoyed it so much I will watch this movie over and over. I must say it was nice to see Anton in a dramatic role. His performance was great.

Yelchin has no sex appeal whatsoever, and his becoming the lover of a beautiful older French woman is as implausible as his being a writer who claims to have 100s of rejections--but you only see dozens on his walls (which somehow are soft enough for thumb tacks).  Glenn Close and Frank Langella are wasted in minor roles which are borderline anti-Semitic, and the whole thing feels like a fairy tale, predictable and thin.  The lead actress doesn't have much to work with because the script is so weak and the movie so vapid it feels as if it's a remake of a French original.....",1453075200,,707,4.595238095238095

It never came to the public theaters in our area.  I waited the usual time for it to become a DVD.  Nothing for one year.  Checked with Amazon many times.  Finally, in September 2015 it was available.  Victor Levin did a magnificent job writing and producing this lovely story of two people who should never have fallen in love, but did.  Real love has no boundaries.  Victor Levin's choice of words is exceptional.  Some are comical; others extremely profound.  His decision to have the male lead express his feelings to the audience as the movie progressed provided a sensitive background for this love affair.  Both the leading man (Anton Yelchin) and woman (Berenice Marlohe) portrayed their characters perfectly and not always with words, but gestures and facial responses.  This allowed you to enjoy their love for each other.  Glenn Close and Frank Langella played their comedy lines with straight faces.  Loved them.  This is a very lighthearted movie, with a big message.  However, I think that those who should have put out full distribution of 5 to 7 to the general public did not get the message.  They were too preoccupied with violent movies, shoot'em up, bang, bang movies, and films with no depth to the plot.  Shame on them.",1448323200,3,1409,4.646341463414634

Unfortunately, Yelchin  was the wrong choice to play Thirlby's much younger lover. He just doesn't portray the type of person Thirlby's character would fall for - ever! He looks like a lost puppy dog during the entire movie and there isn't any stirring chemistry between Thirlby and him. I enjoy good love stories and 5 to 7 had the potential to be a good love story.

I suppose being unique is difficult, after all many stories have already been told somewhere along the line.
I highly recommend this film to anyone interested in the creative mind, true love & the ever-unfolding experiences of life.

I fell in love with Arielle - an enchanting woman of sophistication, intelligence, and grace with a radiant smile. I HIGHLY recommend.",1440288000,23,274,4.978260869565218

7170686,5,B00XK9B070,"This film is a true-love story that feels and looks as magical as love itself. I was enchanted, from beginning to end, by the performances, the struggling young writer subplot, the music, the Manhattan locations, the children, and by a few seconds of beautiful goofiness from Olivia Thirlby. And at the end is a moment, a gesture, really, that warms your heart even as it breaks it.",1440115200,15,382,4.7164179104477615
7170687,5,B00XK9B070,"Wonderful romantic story about a love that was likely doomed from the beginning due to age differences, marital status, children, culture, ethics, etc; however, now that I've watched the movie three times, I see tiny indications of a small fire that hasn't been extinguished.  I'm not so certain that there might not be a future in their future.  Truly underrated movie by many critics and well work a peek.",1440115200,14,407,4.884057971014493

8716133,2,B00XK9B070,"I decided to re watch this movie one day to see if i somehow missed the plot but even after the second time i could not get into this one. Im a big fan of Anton Yelchin and bought this cuz he was in it, i never heard of this movie before so decided to give it another shot after i already disliked it and i  turned it off after a hour into it. Not one of my favorites with Anton Yelchin. its hard to believe he would take on a serious role like this but he was a brilliant person who could do anything he wanted to. I sure do miss that guy",1513036800,,539,3.7280701754385963

8716136,1,B00XK9B070,"Pretty good movie BUT they don't allow you to fast forward through the opening ""trailers"". So, your subject to 8-10 minutes of commercials. It's the LAST TIME I buy IFC films. I emailed the jerks and told them I NEVER will purchase a movie from them again. Probably will fall on deaf ears.",1502150400,,289,4.471698113207547
