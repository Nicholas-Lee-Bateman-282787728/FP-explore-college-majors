3974694,5,B002RSDW80,"I went to see the movie, Julie and Julia solely on the idea that any project Meryl Streep is involved in would automatically be good.  I couldn't imagine before going to see it how they would possibly work the storyline because it was based on two memoirs, one each by the two women involved.  Meryl Streep played Julia Child and Amy Adams played Julie Powell.  Because of her immense respect for Julia Child and her love of cooking Julie Powell decided to set aside 365 days to cook for her husband and herself and as it turned out several other people 524 of Julia Child's recipes.  It started out as a way of breaking the boredom of her day job, an escape from having to live in such a tiny apartment, and a means of teaching her self-discipline by sticking to a planned regimen on a day to day basis.  The result, however, turned out to be much more than that.

Julia Child had and Julie Powell has a very important knowledge about what makes good food great.  Great food is like great sex; both of them have to be more than just ""ok"" to bring a smile to your face that lasts for days every time you think about it.  And both women shared in common the idea that delicious French food should be available to the average American family even if you don't have servants that cook for you or an income that allows you to eat out at a fabulous French restaurant any time you like.  Both of them had wonderful husbands who supported and encouraged their dreams of rising above the drab existence of living vicariously on the accomplishments of their men.  The film captures beautifully the difficulty of that task for both Julie and Julia.  Both of them had forces fighting against their achieving their goals, but the love that was evident in each of their marriages overcame every one of them.

One of the posters for the film is a one-sided poster with a black background, two eggs (one brown and one white), and the question posed, ""Passion. Ambition. Butter.  Do you have what it takes?""  When the movie is over, that question's answer is for both women a resounding ""Yes, but as is always the case, neither of them did it alone"".  The fact that they didn't do it alone though takes nothing away from the uniqueness of their accomplishments.",1249689600,54,2245,4.481572481572481
3974695,5,B002RSDW80,"I am adding to my review for JULIE & JULIA as I am waiting impatiently for my order from Amazon;  I have ordered my very own copy.  I check out the You Tube clips and the clips on Netflix - any place I can find a clip on this very wonderful movie just for my laugh of the day.  Each time I realize how what a classic this movie will be.  This is a terrific movie!

JULIE & JULIA could have earned 10 STARS just on the summer film clips!

Nora Ephron is a terrific writer and director!  We  have seen all of her movies at least 3 or 4 times.  After viewing all the summer film clips,  we knew that  JULIE & JULIA would be no exception.  It was obvious that Julia was not really dead - Julia lives on in the great acting of Meryl Streep.  Meryl is surely the Julia we always knew and loved in our home.

We have 7 sons and in our home on ""JULIA night"" someone would run through the house shouting, in Julia's voice, ""JULIA'S ON! JULIA'S ON!"" All 9 of us would gather in the large master bedroom - sprawled out on the bed, on the floor, in chairs or on a sofa at the end of the bed - laughing at and lovin' on Julia Child. This film  brings back such great memories for our family.  We actually watched YouTube clips of the film yesterday and laughed with tears in our eyes.

Much like Julie in JULIE & JULIA, I am a fan of Julia Child!  I can akimbo a chicken in 3 minutes flat!  I also own Larouse Gastronomique!  I am a Julia fan until I die!

I knew this would be my FAVORITE movie of the year.  It is!",1249689600,11,1503,3.9235880398671097
3974696,4,B002RSDW80,"I've been eagerly awaiting Julie and Julia. Not that I'm a huge follower of Julia. I remember her from my childhood...the quirky voice, the occasional glimpse of her on our small screen television. My mom didn't own ""The Book"" (the 1961 version of Mastering the Art of French Cooking Volume 1) or if she did, I never was allowed to touch it. Julie Powell's book Julie and Julia enticed me. I'm a blogger so Julie Powell's blogging adventure intrigued me. I was disappointed in the lack of Julia in Powell's memoir. And a little overwhelmed by some of the things that took up space that Julia could've filled.

The movie. Ah. On one hand I can say that I loved it. Feel good? Check. Two women, different generations, situations and struggles taking life by the throat and just doing it. Check. Definitely feel good. I loved the supportive and loving men in the lives of Julie and Julia. Meryl Streep, in an enchanting performance, oozes goodwill and charm, embracing life as a generous and lifesized Julia Child. Several scenes were laugh outloud funny, others poignant, and I would have been content with the story of Julia Child. Period. The film even included a Dan Akroyd as Julia Child laugh moment and remake scenes of The French Chef ala Meryl.

Julie Powell's life, on the other hand, lacked a bit. Amy Adams, as Julie Powell, weeping on the floor was very amusing. But there was a disconnect somewhere... in the script, the interpretation, or the tainting in my own mind by having read her memoir. Julie Powell, on the big screen, came across as whiny, weak and fragile. The book Julie Powell (I've not read the blog, so I can't compare there) is a don't-like-it-then-you-know-where-to-shove-it woman with frequent outbursts that seemed to be rages rather than insecurities. The movie Julie Powell discusses her ""_ itchiness"" with a friend. But she doesn't pull off _itch, this character is not a mean girl. And that's probably really the issue. Powell is honest in her memoir, sometimes horrifyingly honest, but it causes a grudging admiration. And she's funny, witty, sarcastic and descriptive which makes her readable and likable on another level. The film didn't pull that out of the character and so we are left with kind of a ""who cares"" or ""that's nice"" secondary scenario in which a girl becomes a woman while following Julia's recipe for a full life. Kind of.

On the family friendliness of this film -- it earned it's PG13 with a few mild makeout scenes, a language list that included at least one each of all the major curse words without overly drowning the audience in expletives. One scene included a descriptive term referencing a male body part or rooster, if you will.

I can recommend it as an entertaining film full of delightful scenery and outdoor markets, laden tables, well-acted characters, charming interactions, and overall deliciousness with a tiny bit of aftertaste of something not so fabulous. Plan to leave the theater with the desire for food or an adventure or a great combination of the two.",1249689600,6,3033,4.826923076923077
3974697,4,B002RSDW80,"What in the world does television and concocting-French-food-in-America pioneer Julia Child have in common with just 30-something government employee turned food blogger, Julie Powell?

Other than the love of food, oodles of butter and a big project to fill the need for purpose, the two main characters in Nora Ephron's biopic, ""Julie and Julia"" share great marriages with men that are not put off by their mate's desire for self-identity defined by more than a few little bouts of self-absorption.  Like a good souffl, Ephron folds the stories told in two books, Powell's ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Julie-and-Julia-My-Year-of-Cooking-Dangerously/dp/031604251X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Julie and Julia: My Year of Cooking Dangerously</a>"" and Child's ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/My-Life-in-France/dp/0307277690/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">My Life in France</a>"" without deflating the overall mixture, although this reviewer would have enjoyed more scenes with the wonderfully talented Meryl Streep who redeems herself quite well (all high-pitched voice, champagne bubbly laughter and squared shoulders) as the indomitable and effusive Julia from her most un-defining role as Donna in that ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mamma-Mia-The-Movie-Widescreen/dp/B001GKJ2DY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mamma Mia! The Movie (Widescreen)</a>"" debacle.

Ephron depicts 1950s Paris with a foodie's appreciation for what that city did and still does for the world of cuisine--from the very first glimpse of Julia's luncheon of sole meunire--the waiter delectably filets the fish's sumptuous flesh tableside to the audiences' very audible groans of anticipation of and appreciation for its buttery taste, but she also does well by Long Island City and its tangle of grey-tinged tenements, elevated trains and apartments over pizza parlors.  Somehow, both Julie and Julia know where to get their ingredients and manage beat, chop (extremely amusing is a scene of Julia alongside a mountain of practice cut onions) and coerce calf's feet, lobsters and ducks into exquisite works of edible art.  The luscious chocolate cakes, whipped creams and raspberry mousse tantalizes like the food porn that it is--a sensual and lascivious reminder to what is truly important in life--you will leave the theater hungry.

Along that line, the two couples, Paul (Stanley Tucci) and Julia and Eric (Chris Messina) and Julie either act as the aphrodisiacs for the food or allow the food to whisk them away in the general direction of the bedroom where dessert or in some cases appetizers segue into the joy of sex and more sex--no wonder Julia was always smiling.  Both male characters offer their women encouragement along the lines of the supporting architectural buttresses on the Cathedral of Notre Dame even when faced by what may seem a bit of an ""I Love Lucy"" type scheme. Regardless, both these ladies made their ideas work whether by design or serendipity and Ephron, wisely asserts that it is their good marriages that deserve the credit--even though the real life Powell has an affair which she chronicles in her not-yet-published memoir about learning the art of the butcher.

Amy Adams' portrayal of Julie Powell seems a little seeped in too much sugar especially if one has read the Julie/Julia Project blog or the book that bears the same name as the film.  In her version, Ephron sanitizes the conservative-hating Powell, cleans up her apartment, washes out her rather profane mouth and thankfully eliminates the girlfriend dramas that take up a third of the memoir.  However, the slim-figured Adams' whose character claims to have gained weight after a year of rich French cuisine simply seems slim and still glows with that Giselle insouciance and naivet she did so well in the Disney film ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Enchanted-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B0011U52EC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Enchanted (Widescreen Edition)</a>.""  Even so, Adams' innate cuteness and 20-something sense of searching works adequately as a foil for the larger than life Streep as the formidable Child.

Bottom Line?  Nora Ephron's ""Julie and Julia"" chronicles the projects of two women from two very different generations with similar needs.  As a combination foodie/chick flick, it works very well in its depiction of determination and the power of a slow and steady perseverance that ultimately leads to success.  However, ""Julie and Julia"" main thrust seems to be a tribute to good marriages where behind every great women stands an equally great and supportive male.  Recommended.

3974698,4,B002RSDW80,"Those of us who grew up watching television in Canada in the late 1950s (when there was only one TV channel) remember our first TV chef -- ""Madame Benoit"" --  who began ALL her recipes (as my mother liked to joke) ""First . . . take a pound of butter.""

Meryl Streep, in a recent interview, publicizing her film portrayal of the ""superchef"" with the distinctive voice (that everyone thinks they can impersonate, at least enough to warble the French expression, ""Bon appetit!"") - Meryl Streep summed up her ""Julia"" cooking experience, in similar fashion:

""Yeah, I learned to cook (in the movie scenes filmed in Paris) and I'm not that good,"" said Meryl. ""But, you know, [if] you put butter on anything, it really does taste better! And that was her [Julia's] whole thing.""

""You are the butter to my bread,"" Julia's loving husband Paul, declares in a dinner toast, at the movie's outset. The same line is repeated, with equal conviction by ""Julie"" the young blogger/writer as the movie nears its close: Julie toasts her young husband for his (almost perfect) support for her monster, on-line project -- her race to master all 524 recipes in Julia Child's ""Art of French Cooking"" -- in just one year.

Julie wins her race, and declares to her hubby (whom she mistook for ""a saint"" before his big blow-up and one night spent away from home) that, ""You are the butter to my bread.""

----

""JULIE & JULIA"" is of course, two parallel movies, opening with Julia Child's arrival in Paris ""France 1949"" --- and quickly intercutting with ""Queens NY 2002"" - the year that Julie masters ""The (entire) Art of French Cooking, by Julia Child"" - in just 365 days.

Amy Adams (who played the Cinderella princess in ""Enchanted"") said she was disappointed that ""the thing about these parallel stories,"" [is] ""I didn't get to share a scene with Meryl."" Similarly, her real-life character ""Julie the blogger"" didn't begin her project till the year Julia Child died, (2002, age 91) - so Julie & Julia never met.

There's a sweetly endearing taste to the air throughout this movie, (which at times steers a little close to the sort of `chick flick' cuteness, for which the director of films like ""Sleepless in Seattle"" is famous.

But director Nora Ephron manages to maintain a `documentary' style balance to this true story . . . thanks mainly to Meryl Streep's transcendent performance, (so believable as Julia) plus some authentic touches for those who know their French cooking.

There is a moment when Julia's husband ""Paul"" -- encouraging her initial foray into French cooking (a Blue Ribbon diploma course in Paris) -- gifts Julia with France's most famous recipes collection (entirely in French, of course!)

The camera dwells (twice) on the big, leather-bound book's embossed title, ""Larousse Gastronomique,"" (France's cooking encyclopedia for almost a century).

In the next scene, as the doting couple prepare for bed, Julia asks Paul to (better) translate words she hesitantly misconstrues as, ""bathe the chicken legs in (what else?) butter.""

-----

It's a good film (I say) that knows how to employ silences;  what the director leaves out can be as important as what she has left in: If you watched this in a movie theatre (as I did this evening) you may sense in the darkness around you, an audience that is warm with unspoken appreciation for a closing scene exquisite in its simplicity.

Julia, who a scene earlier has celebrated a ""special delivery"" letter from Knopf Publishing House (""We love your cook book and would be proud to publish it"") enters her kitchen (later replicated at the Smithsonian Institute). She's there to taste what's cooking on the stove but is wearing (then) fashionable high heels and -- as always -- a string of pearls, as she did on all her cooking shows.

The kitchen is silent . . . apart from a radio-in-the-background, softly playing a great old `standard' --  singer Margaret Whiting's orchestral rendition of a great old Sinatra song - [Jule Styne's masterpiece, TIME AFTER TIME - whose lyric by Sammy Cahn, includes the words:]

Time after time, I tell myself that I'm so lucky to be loving you . . .so lucky to be, the one you run to see, in the evening, when the day is through . . . ""

Almost without looking up from reading some papers, Paul casually passes Julia a package that's arrived in the mail. She opens it, and finds the first printed edition of her new (1961) cookbook.

Words can't convey (better than the joyful woops of two fine actors) the sweet taste of this moment in time. Whether or not this one wins an Oscar, Nora Ephron has delivered a solid ""winner"" -- straight to the hearts of film-goers everywhere -- of a simply-told, and simply wonderful, ""true story.""

3974699,5,B002RSDW80,"Julia's Paris in 1949 against Julie's Queens of 2002, the related lives of two women rolled onward being at times funny, romantic, emotional, scenic, and endearing. Julie and Julia face a milestone in life, one being a mid-lifer with nothing to accomplish, and one facing age 30 with an unproductive career.

Meryl Streep as Julia Child is fantastic as the older of the pair. As fun an believable playing fun-loving Julia as her role in ""Mama Mia."" She forges ahead, unafraid, into the domain of french chefs. A food publication becomes her goal. Julie Powell (Amy Adams--Night at the Museum) challenges herself to cooking all recipes in Child's French book, within a year, and blogging the experience, while working a full-time job, and keeping her hubby, Eric, happy in the apartment over the Pizza shop.

Julie and Julia keep the husbands happy. Paul Child played by Stanley Tucci (The Terminal, Devil Wears Prada), is a delight to watch. Both Julia and Julie are amorous enough for any man's pleasure. Just what did J.Child mean when she stated ""everything's better with butter?"" Julie and Julia is not R-rated, but fun, realistic, healthy-marriage style romance. Applause, applause!

The couples are almost always working together, reaching for an achievement of the wife's choosing, husbands being faithful and encouraging. Not the typical Hollywood plot or agenda, and because of the humorous treatment of the dialogue, this romantic element keeps the film from becoming a ""chic flick"".

So what's so good, deserving 5 sugar-glazed stars? Relationships sustained out of mutual admiration, communication, trust, and marital united fronts. What a unique recipe for a fantastic movie coming from Hollywood in the 21st century. The story this mix of cast and ingredients cooked up is worthy of any RECIPE BOOK or romantic/comedy.

FOOD. Any story about Julia Child must include food. ""Julie and Julia"" will leave you heading for the nearest restaurant. Delicious looking food. Recipes should be on DVD inserts. The props department should win awards. The clean-up crew likely gained many pounds.

A highly recommended movie from someone and his wife beyond middle age. Should also delight the 30-somethings.  I Loved this movie. I feel pleasantly fuller by at least 25 pounds.",1249603200,,2279,5.193460490463215
3974700,3,B002RSDW80,"As you can never have too much butter, you can also never have too much Meryl Streep and Amy Adams; they are once again delightful to watch, playing characters that are superbly favorable and enhanced with humorous screenwriting. The drama, comedy and cooking is all skillfully balanced, although with a two-hour runtime, the pacing isn't the most perceptive. It's an entertaining, enjoyable film, brilliantly combining two stories into one to demonstrate the influence and similarities between them. While the event is never unappealing, it's also not exceedingly revolutionary.

Julie & Julia is based on two best-selling memoirs, one from famous cook Julia Child about her life in France, and the other by Julie Powell, a woman who's life was greatly affected by Child's cookbook. The film carefully weaves the two together, alternating between Child's (Meryl Streep) struggles in Europe and Powell's (Amy Adams) conflicts in New York. Both are fueled by the healing power of cooking, a passion for food and the perfect kind of butter.

In 1949 France, Julia Child settles in with her diplomat husband Paul (Stanley Tucci) to a new environment and tries to sort out what she wants to do with her time. After determining that she has an uncanny love of food (shopping for groceries is as much fun to her as other women find buying a new dress), she takes up schooling with professionals, eventually teaches a few students, and works on collaborating on her own enormous cookbook. When she can't find any French cookbooks written for Americans, she knows she's found her calling.

On the other side of the globe and in the year 2002, Julie Powell is adapting to a new apartment in Queens with her writer husband Eric (Chris Messina) and her depressing job as a government agency secretary. Her spare time is devoted to food as well - both women find relief in the preparation of food almost more than eating it. When her day job starts to really wear away at her soul, she decides to write an internet blog that explains a unique goal she sets for herself: to prepare every recipe in Julia Child's cookbook - 524 recipes in 365 days. Initially she must deal with a lack of readership (simply throwing words out into a void, which is what blogging nowadays has really become), the negativity of her mother, the strain on the relationship with her husband, a lobster killing ordeal, and the most formidable task of boning a duck.

For Julie and Julia, cooking is a method of getting away from the troubles of real life. They are saved by food. For the audience, the two leads once again prove their talents, although this is not a movie to watch on an empty stomach. Director Nora Ephron handles the material well, blending the two narratives, the two locations and comedy and drama into a delicious tale of a deliriously cheery woman and a typical, practical city girl who are liberated by preparing the most mouthwatering treats. It's a simple, charmingly pleasant film well worth a look, but also certainly not a masterpiece.

On the flip side, Amy Adams' character, Julie wasn't likable to me. She was whiny, self-centered, poor me, pouting, throwing herself on the floor blah blah blah. ADOLESCENT.

3974734,4,B002RSDW80,"I love Julia Child...and I loved her half of the story...every part of it really.  Meryl Streep was just wonderful...Stanley Tucci was so charming... Jane Lynch was perfection.  My issues were with the B story.  Amy Adams was cute enough as the younger Julie. But I was not inspired by the story at all... I mean a story about a woman that cooked dinner every day for a year using someone else's recipes.... and wrote notes about it.  OK.  She rode the blogging popularity wave and got famous.  But it doesn't make her story inspirational.  I mean she achieved all her success on the coattails of a far more interesting woman. If you read the original blog... not much there...really.  I know it might be harsh, but to me this part of the film is a portrait of a mediocre person. Especially compared to JC.  And her husband... uggg.  He was an early hipster bun head minus the bun...the couple's issues and whining were a bit annoying.  And even more specifically, the sound editing really plays up the smacking and munching sounds.  I had to fast forward through scenes when Julie and her husband were eating b/c I hate the loud food eating sounds.  (Specifically the bruschetta scene.  I literally gagged.)  If that bothers you...just beware. Also, the film creates 'drama' out of the silliest stuff.... like why is there a whole thing about Julie having issues with cooking a live lobster...but she has no issues with beef or chicken.... they were alive once too.  BUT all the problems with that side of the movie... it does not diminish the Julia Child story.  Every part of the Julia Child's story is compelling!  From the very first scenes in France...and looking for her inspiration.... and finding herself at cooking school... I was charmed... I loved learning how she began teaching and finding her friends ... and then why she began writing her books with her friends. Everything about her family is adorable ...her sister... and Paul and Julia's marriage is delightful.  Every part of it is fascinating. I would have loved the movie even more if it were just the Julia Child story....  Bon appetit!",1512691200,,2109,4.741758241758242

3974736,3,B002RSDW80,Not sure.. didn't finish the movie . but I love that Julia was much more than the French Chef... have to laugh I loved when she made grilled cheese on Letterman... so long ago... she chased it with some Budweiser... I'm not a Bud fan... but I think Julia must of had a great sense of humour....,1511395200,,294,4.175438596491228
3974737,4,B002RSDW80,"I adore this movie for the wonderful cooking, the witty sense of humor and the belly aching laughs.  It has a few moments of language-which I wish it didn't.  Meryl Streep drops the F bomb once, which I dislike and other more common curse words throughout the movie.  It also has a few intimate scenes which could have been left out.",1510790400,,333,4.426229508196721
3974738,3,B002RSDW80,"While this film can be entertaining, especially Streep as Julia, the story does not hold together to the end. The end is very disappointing. In a way the story suffers from the same flaw as Julie's blog, in that it's just happening for the sake of happening. This movie is two stories that are tied together almost by coincidence. Julia wrote a cookbook and Julie is making recipes from the cook book every day. That's about it.

3974870,4,B002RSDW80,"I'm not sure what it is about this film that fascinates me so. I have it on Blu-Ray but I just bought the streaming version so I can watch it whenever I want without having to bother with a disc. I love Meryl Streep as Julia. She brings such joy and presence to the screen. And the relationship between Julia and her husband Paul is a delight. I'm sure their marriage was not as smooth as the movie makes it seem, but nonetheless, they seem very much in love.

Another amazing thing about this movie is Amy Adams manages to make Julie Powell a reasonably sympathetic character. If you've read the book, you know that Julie Powell is, as she describes herself in the movie, a bitch. Compared to the at least four times I've watched the movie, I have read the book only once, even though I do have a hardcover copy of it and I plan to keep it. I might even read it again someday.

This is a fun movie to watch. Maybe that's part of the attraction. It makes life seem so simple and joyful, at least the segments with Julia Child do. And the segments with Julie Powell have an upbeat quality to them. Even her melt-downs seem funny rather than childish and selfish as they do in the book.

So if you're looking for a fun movie, especially if you have some foodie friends, invite them all over, pop some gourmet popcorn, and watch Julie & Julia.",1473724800,,1340,4.288537549407114

Oh - you're asking about the movie....  OK.  What a super concept to combine two lives, two books in to one movie.  Well acted, smoothly combined.
If you like to cook...if you've struggled to balance passion, relationship, 'day job' - you'll relate to these two very different/very similar women.  And you'll enjoy this movie!",1473638400,2,575,4.927083333333333

Based on real life events, it was done with a lot of creativity and I found it very entertaining. Though I was never a great fan of Julia Child, it was still fascinating to watch how her life evolved -- and I can say I have a lot more respect for her, now, seeing what she went through to accomplish all she did. Streep does a wonderful portrayal in this film. Adams, as always, was fun and quirky and brought a lot of life to her character.

Meryl Streep did a great job portraying Julia Childs, something that I thought would be an impossible feat.  After watching this movie I've binge watched Julia's cooking shows, tried out some recipes, and have realized what a treasure that has been lost with her passing.

I didn't realize how warm, human, and humorous that Julia Child was, or even her basic history and how she had come to be such a television cooking icon.  I did read something a few years ago about Julie's blog, and thought that it had to be an impossible undertaking to cook everything in her cookbook in a year.

Very enjoyable.  May inspire you to binge cook, or marathon cook.",1465948800,,780,4.575539568345324

I forget how/why the movie was suggested, but I watched the trailer with her and thought it did look kinda ""cute"", so we watched it.  I was in love with Streep's Child within 30 minutes!  No, it's not ""Dr. Zhivago"" or ""The Godfather"", but a very enjoyable little movie, nonetheless.

3975057,5,B002RSDW80,"This Julie and Julia movie DVD purchase was well worth it.  The Julie and Julia movie stars Meryl Streep as Julia Child, Stanley Tucci as Paul Child, Amy Adams as Julie Powell, Chris Messina as Eric Powell etc. Julie yearns to start a cooking blog as a creative release from the usual day to day fare of her job.  Julies husband Eric is actually extremely supportive of what she is doing but just wants her to try to not be so serious about it.  The movie also shows a glimpse into the journey of what Julia Child and her husband Paul Child go through during their journeys abroad in Paris and stateside.  Jane Lynch makes an appearance as Julie Childs sister. I did like that the movie depicted an honest reality of how you want to be careful in how you mention your current employer on your blog in case they look at it if you go from obscurity to gaining more recognition and/or fame(Julie Powells employer gave her a warning but Im aware that not all employers will give a warning, although Id be surprised if any of the managers at my job look at any of my blogs for reasons I prefer to not go into).Im intuitively feeling guided to avoid saying more about the Julie and Julia movie for those who have yet to see Julie and Julia but I would like to say this; I think that it is inspirational and a great thing that Julie Powell achieved recognition for her blog and fame that led to a movie deal. I see nothing wrong with that. However, I do feel that it is important to want to blog, write, and/or be a screenwriter etc. regardless of whether you stay an obscure writer or a famous writer and/or how many supporters you may have (due to the fact that sheer enjoyment/passion in blogging and writing can sustain you both during happy and challenging times in your life and regardless of what critics may think). However, I did enjoy how the Julie and Julia movie showed a glimpse behind the decision making that can sometimes influence whether and/or when a book is published.  The following special features are attributed to the phenomenal Julie and Julia DVD; Secret Ingredients Creating Julie and Julia and Commentary with Writer/Director Nora Ephron.",1449792000,4,2160,4.528205128205128

3975064,4,B002RSDW80,"""Julie & Julia"", Nora Ephron's adaptation of Julie Powell's book is quite delightful. Meryl Streep's portrayal of Julia Child is as delicious as the recipes in Child's's first book. Streep's every gesture, inflection, and nuances are to be savored like a fine wine. Amy Adams puts in a solid performance as the bold and determined blogger. Adams brings a unique flavor of just the right mixture of sass and coyness to the role. The film maintains an excellent balance between drama, comedy, panache, and plain old good story telling. For me, it is a much-welcomed break from the usual and typical shoot 'em up, monster, superhero, action, Harry Potter, and lame comedy summer fare. This is a film done with class, intelligence, and has a great deal of charm, wit, and subtle modern-day humor and sensibilities. It may not be for your average movie goer, but for me, it is a significant notch way above the rest. Do yourself a big favor, and take your significant other to see what amounts to so much more than just a mere a ""chick flick"". Make sure you watch on a full stomach, though, as the featured dishes and cooking, combined with laughter will have your stomach growling and howling simultaneously. As Julia Child was fond of saying: Bon Apetit!",1448496000,,1251,4.7695852534562215

 Now as to why I am giving it three stars, Amy Adams character is a bore. Her story line does absolutely nothing for me. I agree with many reviewers here that I also fast forward through all of her scenes. I truly believe that this movie should have only reflected on Julia. Amy's Julie is boring and whinny.

3975091,4,B002RSDW80,"Meryl is - as always - a complete marvel. What a difficult person to play - quirky and awkward, a REAL person rather than just a made-up character, someone familiar to so many and seemingly impossible to imitate without going a million ways off course - most especially towards caricature -- but Meryl Streep pulls out an uncanny ""taste"" (or version) of Julia Child that I never wd've believed even Meryl had in her. She truly captured the woman's essence and somehow made her sort-of famous gawkiness downright warm, sexy and appealing Bc she made her so likeable. I personally cdnt stand the other character - Julie - for which I blame the seemingly narcissistic and self-important author as the actress was only given what she was given. And that was a harpy, complaining, walking-headache-inducer. If you can't make an actress as likeable as Amy Adams even very pleasant, then maybe the whole book AND movie cdve been JUST JULIA - which wdve been marvelous. The modern-day housewife-ish Julie is just a bore and I'm sure everyone spent her parts just waiting for Meryl/Julia to come light up the rooms again. This was apparent from the book alone, so Adams did the best she could with the part (a part you wd certainly expect to be miles easier than harnessing the unusualness of Julia Child's light - but based on the book I imagine Adams just had to slog through it and tide us over between Meryl's scenes. I liked Amy Adams as the author better than I liked the author as the author, in the book, which shd tell you something.
And Stanley Tucci is also wonderful. But all glory goes to the chameleon of all chameleons - Meryl Streep - disappearing into a role as different and complicated and impossible as Julia Child and making it WORK. That is magic. It's similar to actors playing Truman Capote or something - where the real person was so odd and different that it seems difficult to picture playing him with the odd voice and strange/different look without going to caricature. Worth watching even if you fast fed poor Amy's scenes.",1445904000,,2044,4.680555555555555

Amy Adams made her likeable and easy to empathize with.  I had watched some of Julia Child's cooking shows and while interesting couldn't connect with her and Meryl Streep did a wonderful job of bringing her to life and sharing her humanity.  The costuming was delightful.  I think the Julia time period is one of my favorites for clothing styles.  The details, whether it's the gloves and hats or tucks and gathers that just aren't used anymore, make all the difference.",1444262400,,627,4.636363636363637

3975108,5,B002RSDW80,"Meryl Streep portrayed Julia so well that I'm beginning to forget what the real Julia was like. They did a good job of making the relatively short Meryl Streep seem tall. I love the guy who plays her husband. He was a pleasure to watch. I've seen him portray true bad guys (as in the Pelican Brief) and he was excellent then, too. I am sorry his career hasn't done better.

Amy Adams was funny, cute and believable. I saw this movie when it first came out but it's worth the rental fee to see it again.",1443830400,,502,4.175257731958763

3975115,5,B002RSDW80,I loved this movie!  I had to blink and look twice at Julia.  Meryl Streep was excellent!  I used to watch the original cooking shows on Public Television.  This movie captured as much of the character of the real Julia as possible.  Very entertaining.  Very informative and inspiring.,1443139200,,285,4.833333333333333

3975121,4,B002RSDW80,Meryl Streep and Amy Adams? The retro part of the movie is the best but it's an entertaining idea. It's really fun to watch Meryl Streep play Julia Child. A labor of love for Streep and Ephron to celebrate this icon of food.,1441497600,,224,4.232558139534884
3975122,4,B002RSDW80,"I gave this film 4 stars solely because of Meryl Streep.  I would have loved the movie if it had been only about Julia Child and played by Meryl Streep.  The Julie part of the title is an annoying, cloying, uninteresting person whose writing is lame.  Furthermore, the guy who plays her husband eats like a pig.  The two of them were incredibly boring.  Which makes Meryl Streep's performance all that much more remarkable, because this would have been a stupid, vapid story and a non-starter of a movie if not for her.  She carried the entire movie.",1441497600,,550,4.561224489795919
3975123,5,B002RSDW80,Meryl Streep and Amy Adams....Nora Ephron's screenplay of the book is not surprisingly astoundingly good. Streep as always is perfection and beyond. She is a one of a kind. Perfect pairing of her with Stanley Tucci. Buy it! And remember to watch the additional material on the making of the film--fascinating.,1441411200,,309,5.078431372549019

3975129,5,B002RSDW80,One of my favorite movies. Meryl Streep was wonderful as Julia Child. Excellent cast who told Mrs. Child's story beautifully. I didn't know she had such a romantic love story. It was a wonderful contrast between the romantic love stories of Julie and Julia. I loved the weaving in and out of time between the two lovely cooks from two time eras.,1439769600,,345,4.580645161290323

3975132,5,B002RSDW80,As a woman going to Culinary school currently this movie shows me how hard things were back in Julia's time for woman wanting to become chef's. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a feel good meaningful movie.,1438646400,,216,4.564102564102564

3975134,5,B002RSDW80,Julie & Julia is another movie that Meryl Streep held me captive in front of the TV.  I highly recommend this video.  Her portrayal of Julia Child was extraordinary.  I showed great insight into the life of our beloved Chef.  It gets a 5 star rating from me.,1438300800,,258,4.3125

3975147,1,B002RSDW80,"If I could find how to submit a question or comment on this movie I would, but I do not see such an option, therefore I am submitting this review even though I have not watched this movie; I'm doing this in case there are others out there like me that may share my sentiments. I watched the preview of this movie and was not overly impressed by it, however, I am a big fan of Ms. Streep so I was willing to give it a chance. However, when I found out that Mrs. Julia Child herself, before she passed away, was not the least bit impressed by Mrs. Powell's blog I really see no point in watching the film.  If Mrs. Child was not impressed by the blog and thought Mrs. Powell was looking for attention more than anything else (my interpretation, not her exact words) then I see no reason in watching ""Julie & Julia"" because Mrs. Powell's portion of the film is based upon her book which details her blog experiment/goal (whatever you want to call it).  I just see no point in watching a movie that is based, or inspired by, real people that did not get their seal of approval and/or if said real person has a bone of contention in regards to its execution (which is why, for example, I never watched ""American Gangster""). Of course no one involved HAS to get Mrs. Child's approval, however, if she herself was not impressed with Mrs. Powell's actions and there's several reviews written by real people who state Mrs. Powell's character in the film is irritating at best, then what's the point in watching it? Maybe if it were available for Prime I'd give it a chance, maybe, but I'm certainly not wasting money renting it; maybe if we're lucky, a movie based solely on Mrs. Child will come out at some point.",1436832000,3,1705,4.375394321766562

3975162,5,B002RSDW80,"Meryl Streep does an excellent job of acting, as usual. I could almost believe that she was Julia Child. I enjoyed watching her on screen, and the imitations she did of some of Ms. Child's most well known instructions. ""Here is where the omelette becomes a little tricky, at the point where you have to turn it over."" (It breaks as she turns it) ""Oh well, remember that you are the only one in the kitchen and no one is watching you, so just patch it up."" (Demonstrates, by patting it together) As for Amy Adams, she is another of my favorite actresses. Don't miss her in ""Leap Year"" with Mathew Goode. I think men will find both films enjoyable. Women will love them.",1434412800,,668,4.395161290322581

Meryl Streep as Julia was spot on amazing.  Knowing the side story of the writers of the original books was a interesting reveal.

The scene with the visit to the kitchen at the Smithsonian was nice as I got to see the exhibit shortly after it opened.

I loved the parallel story telling and didn't get confused by it (as I sometimes do).  I was disappointed that (in real life) Julia ignored Julie's cooking attempt.",1432425600,,617,4.258620689655173

I think the complaining and whining that julie brought was not really important in my view. Like when you you order a burger with no tomato but they add it and then you just kinda eat it because its there. JULIA all the way!,1429660800,,394,3.9375

3975212,5,B002RSDW80,"This is a fascinating and engrossing movie!  Meryl Streep as Julia Child is spot on and very well played by the magic Meryl.  The plot is engaging and easy to enjoy from beginning to end.  I am almost inspired to cook my way through The Art of French Cooking, as Julie did, but <alas> - I am a lousy cook!",1428105600,,305,4.05
3975213,4,B002RSDW80,"Meryl Streep is amazing once again, and her TV show appearances reminded me of the actual Julia Child TV shows i watched way way back in the day. Captured Julia's upper class yet unpretentious attitude X unflappable intensity X determination to do well - and - share it with the rest of us. Julia made French cooking accessible to a culture that might have otherwise been the last to get it at all - the U.S. which was then hooked on TV dinners and going to the ""shopping centers"" which later became ""malls"". Having read about her relationship with her husband, played also to perfection by Stanley Tucci, which was loving and mutually supportive, brought the whole evolution of Julia moving from boredom to entering a man's world with determination and then articulating to others all about the smell and shape of French cooking, from the precious butter on out.

The story of Julie and her husband is a little confusing because it's about a woman who is trying to figure out what to do with her life, sets goals for herself, gets obsessed in ways that at first her husband supports and then their marriage gets tested, but seems to triumph. It's also about how being willing to have an interest of one's own, can get in the way of doing one's job from day to day, but also help fulfill some inner calling that goes beyond what other people ask us to do for pay. In this case the job was meaningful but maybe not perfectly aligned with Julie. Pushing herself to cook over 500 dishes in a year wasn't perfectly aligned with having a life during that time also, either. But overall Julie makes it happen and has a more complete life.

Julie for real and Julie in the movie might not be as close a match as Julia for real and Julia in the movie. But the late and supertalented Nora Ephron was so masterful at making films that delight, entertain, and inspire, and help us feel a little better about ourselves, or at least what we can become, that some possible shortcuts and compromises in factual material can be forgiven.

There is a certain amount of learning about cooking itself, and you may feel motivated to do a bit more if you're one of those people on the cusp of getting into cooking more and grabbing stuff off the grocery shelves or going to restaurants a little less.

Life in Julia's time was more about rich and heavy food but also more about graciousness and quiet dignity and patience. Life in Julie's time maybe a bit more about personal interests and frustrations being allowed to overrule, at times, what's best for office and home. While cooking allows us to have a relationship with food - that is about more than just consuming it.",1428019200,,2653,4.543933054393306

3975293,4,B002RSDW80,"Fans of Nora Ephron will know this was the last film she directed and somehow that fact is very moving given the material. Ephron was a script writer and director who revealed for us the different perspectives men and women bring to their relationships, and the optimism she invests in this final film in terms of the mutual support a good partnership can provide is a testament to male and female interaction. Somehow, this is very hopeful coming from such a biting wit as the writer of Heartburn. Because the film is such great fun, especially because of Streep's performance, the depth of insight that Ephron brings to it can easily be overlooked. I remember reading an excellent review when the film first came out. Unfortunately, I can't recall the reviewer (I think it was a NYT review); but the central observation praised Ephron's focus on the maintenance of a good marriage, which stands in contrast to the usual romantic comedy fare. Every time I watch this particular film, I think about this aspect of it. The relationship between Julia Child and her husband Paul is the more mature of the two, and it is very rewarding to watch the ways in which these two characters support one another through the inevitable ups and downs of a shared life. I feel sure that Ephron has hit on a central truth of their relationship. Paul's unwavering belief in Julia's talent and his joy at her success show what a man's love and support can do for a gifted woman and also for himself. Rather than being a feminist statement, it is a film about sharing and cooperation and affection, which is infinitely more human. Wherever you are now, Nora - Bravo!",1419811200,,1647,4.682758620689655

3975297,3,B002RSDW80,"I really enjoy this film, and I look forward to it when it comes on television.

The scenes with Julia Child/Meryl Streep are amazing.  Yes, Streep is her usual magnificent self, but Julia Child herself is amazing.  This film wasn't just about Julie Powell executing Julia Child's recipe's or Julia Child's love for food.  It was also a love story, and Paul Child/Stanley Tucci's adoration for his wife gushed throughout the film.  He was always supportive, very patient, never critical, and it was obvious that Paul Child was in awe of his wife.  Not depicted in the film, but I read that he spent his later years writing beautiful poems to his wife.

I love all the scenes with Julia Child/Meryl Streep.  I wish there had been more focus on her.

This is not to take away from Amy Adams.  I suspect Amy Adams just didn't have a lot to work with.  Amy Adams tried to make Julie Powell likeable, but unfortunately, it just didn't work.  Julie Powell bordered onto creepy (yeah, her obsession with Julia Child's was more fanatic than healthy), was often times narcissistic, and I just didn't care about her.  That's not to say there weren't some great scenes.  My favorite parts were those scenes featuring cooking and eating.  That is because I didn't care about Julie Powell as a person.  I didn't care about her marriage, her slump, her job, her family, and I felt so bad for her long-suffering husband.

Julia Child deserves a movie of her own.  I would love a film that focused more on her family.  Her bond with her sister and her toleration of her father.  I loved Julia Child's relationship and felt their sadness in not having children.

Julia Child became a great culinary icon, but the film to me was also a love story.  I won't say that the scenes with Julie Powell/Amy Adams were interruptions, but in no way could Julie Powell compete with Julia Child's charisma, presence, kindness and personality.

Still, I very much like this film.",1419724800,6,1948,4.6647058823529415

3975317,5,B002RSDW80,"One of my favorite movies.  As usual Meryl Streep and Stanley Tucci were fantastic.  Love cooking movies and this was my favorite.  This was my first introduction to Amy Adams, who I couldn't relate to as to for her melt downs (but in subsequent movies, love her).  But having the cookbook, I'm surprised she didn't have more...  The recipes are hard and labor intensive!  Actually became emotional at the end.  Would hope that is not how Julia Child actually reacted to someone blogging about and cooking her recipes. Learned a lot about Julia and her husband that I did not know.  My boss gave me this cookbook and the first recipe I tried was the Boeuf Bourguignon, probably on the recommendation of my boss.  Never made another dish from this ckbk.  BUT the movie got me hooked on the way they make Crostini (not Bruschetta as they call it).  My mouth was watering and I make it whenever I have home-grown tomatoes, fresh basil and good bread which is often during the summer.  Be sure to watch the movie extras.",1418169600,,1016,4.583333333333333
3975318,5,B002RSDW80,"This gem of a film is perfect for staying in on a cold winter evening. Warning: make sure you've eaten before watching, or the endless stream of gourmet dishes may cause you to break your diet.

Nora Ephron's love letter to Julia Child is only one half of this darling story. Julia Child, as portrayed by the ever-wonderful Meryl Streep, was a big women with a big personality. Amy Adams is Julie Powell, a New Yorker who has taken on the gargantuan task of cooking her way through Julia Child's ""Mastering the Art of French Cooking"" in one year while she blogs about her experience. Julie & Julie are both real women who are blessed with loving, supportive husbands, affectionately portrayed by Stanley Tucci and Chris Messina. (The relationships these four portray are probably the best thing about the movie. No one is perfect, but they are perfect for each other. Marital discord is the subject of so many films and television shows, so it's a breath of fresh air to watch these couples act as though they genuinely like one another.)

Wonderful performances and balanced storytelling allow you to get lost in the worlds of both women. Food may be the centerpiece of the film, but love and determination and a refusal to sit back and let life happen to them is the common thread that ties both women -- and these stories -- together.",1418083200,,1337,4.661016949152542
3975319,5,B002RSDW80,Love it,1418083200,,7,3.0
3975320,5,B002RSDW80,"Before I bought this film I hadn't seen it in a theater or on TV.  I bought it because I was curious as to how Meryl Streep would bring Julia Child to the screen and be convincing in the role.  Amy Adams, as Julie is absolutely wonderful as the young woman who is a frustrated ad unpublished writer who discovers her heart and soul in a blog she begins online.  This is not just any blog...it is the journey of a person who has difficulty completing tasks and who sets out to challenge herself into writing a blog and forcing herself to do so on a daily basis!  But what is the subject matter going to be?  Blog about what?  What will be interesting enough to write and be a subject that she, and hopefully others, will have enough pizazz to hold her focus?  Julie loves to cook and decides that recipes will be the point of her blog...but not just any recipe and not just any food!  It is to be the foods of France and the recipes of the one woman who brought its wonders into our collective consciousness...Julia Child!  We meet Julia Child from the moment she lands in Paris from the USA in 1948, as a woman married to Paul Child, a wonderful man who is in the US Foreign Service. With her bright blue Buick woody station wagon in tow, Julia wends her way through Paris with a brand of animated excitement only she can register.  Since she has relatively little to do in her new surroundings, her love of good food along with the foods she is eating at the fine restaurants in the region, gives her the idea of learning how to cook in the French manner.  Along the way she decides to try and translate this wonderful cuisine into something suited to the American housewife. The long road from studying at Cordon Bleu and her meeting with Simone Beck and Louisette Bertholle to the publishing of ""Mastering The Art of French Cooking"" is the backdrop for Julia Child's part of this wonderful, true story and it is an integral part of the film because of Streep's masterful performance!  Once again you are stunned by the transformation of Streep into the rather large (6'2""), very quirky, gifted, intelligent and vocally unique, Julia Child. There is not a moment in the entire film where you do not believe you are actually seeing Child in the flesh and that is quite a feat!  Meanwhile Julie decides to blog about her life as it co-insides with and as she offers up all 524 recipes over the next 365 days to her readers, if she indeed gets any, and sets out to follow the culinary path of one of the world's greatest chefs in so doing!  This is a fun film that includes all the poignancy, drama and unpredictability of real life...and it is a must see! Yes, you must see this film in order to believe it...better yet, you must have this film in your collection so you can see it again and again when you need a lift or when you just want to watch, yet another jaw-dropping performance by Streep. Once again, a great big BRAVO to the entire cast but especially to Meryl Streep, who never ceases to amaze.",1417996800,,3006,4.383093525179856

This is a story about one woman's journey to improve herself, and her life. Meryl Streep is very good as Ms. Child. I was inspired enough by this movie that I thought to myself, why don't I try what Julie did? Only instead of French Cooking, I'm going to use the Weight Watchers(copyright) 5 ingredient 15 minute cookbook. I am on my own personal journey to lose weight and be healthy again.

The only thing I didn't like about the movie is the few lines that were extremely political and partisan, making fun of people who's politics are not liberal/Democrat, but I can overlook this, as the rest of the movie is very well done.

I normally do not like ""girl movies"", I find them condescending, but Ms. Ephron's movies are the exception.",1412208000,,868,4.452830188679245

that interesting.

expecting something different.
The person I gave it to loved every bit of it and so did her friends. Well, just never know. We all

Now that I think of it, only watch this movie when your girlfriend wants to watch a chick flick and you'll get away without actually having to watch a chick flick! That's my tip! And it's still about food, so your not giving in to your girlfriend 100%. But face it, you're still going to her friend's wine tasting party. So take a small victory and watch this movie with her.

I couldn't bear this on and off nonsense for more than 1 hour.

3975435,5,B002RSDW80,"I couldn't wait for this to come out on DVD. I often watched the real Julia Child in the 80s. She was 6' 2"" tall, frizzy haired, and built like a line backer. Sometimes she goofed terribly on live TV but took it in stride. She seemed the most unlikely person to become a TV personality hawking haute cuisine, and demonstrate the fine art of French cooking. But even if you never tried a single Child recipe you loved to tune in to her program. Why? Because she was thoroughly likeable and you knew she loved cooking.

Meryl Streep always seems to out do herself in each new performance and film. Being today's great character actress, her Julia Child is simply a delight to watch. Julie & Julia is actually two films playing back to back and in different times. They are woven together extremely well, but it is Meryl Streep's performance you find yourself waiting for during the ""other"" plot. Only a second viewing does one come to appreciate the two films and how they work together.

I cannot overstate my recommendation for this film. It is simply a fun flick and an absolute delight to watch. Meryl Streep is always worth the price of admission. Also see her in The Devil Wears Prada.

But I would strongly suggest watching a little of the real Julia Child first on Youtube, or you will miss the subtle nuances of Meryl Streep's amazing performance. Silly me, but the ending of Julie & Julia never fails to bring a tear to my eye.",1400544000,2,1435,4.490421455938697

The parallel true stories of these two ladies take you on a lovely journey across France with the Childs and through New York after 9/11 with the Powells.  The locations are different but the women truly are kindred spirits.  Also enjoyed Jane Lynch as Julia's tall sister. Perhaps when you view this movie, you can tell me the sorriest part of the story.  Everyone I talk to about this movie has the exact same regret for Julie.

As others have noted, the Julia Powell character and her husband are just awful bores.  Julia Child and her husband come across as cultured, accomplished, cosmopolitan, emotionally mature, and fundamentally decent people.  Powell comes across as a glib, self-absorbed, tantrum-throwing snowflake.  Her husband is barely an actual character at all.
To me, the difference is a great illustration of why youth is not automatically more compelling.  No, it isn't enough to be young, cute, and glib.  I'm sure that's not the message the film was intending, but it's what I was reminded about.  I, like many, wanted to rush out and get a copy of Child's book immediately, but I wanted nothing at all to do with anything Powell had written or done.",1398470400,,839,4.825174825174825

3975458,2,B002RSDW80,"I seldom watch newer movies because I often find the language and attitudes (disobedience to parents, snide dialog masquerading as wit, etc.) offensive, but I did decide to view this one, out of curiosity. I have liked Mrs. Child ever since I read her book MY LIFE IN FRANCE, which was in effect a tribute to her late husband, their successful marriage, and the adventuresome style of life they relished together. The story recaptured for me some of the magic and romance of being young: you are curious, yet naive; you are hungry for MORE LIFE but too impeded by inexperience and general gaucherie to know how to take hold of it. Sometimes, if you are fortunate, someone comes along and shows you the way. For Julia, Paul Child was this person; what a remarkable man he was: talented, cultured --an artist and a thinker. A man interested in many things is an interesting man; I wish I could have known him.

While I respect Ms. Streep as an actor and was mesmerized by her portrayal of ""Sophie"", Julia Child as played by Ms. Streep is a cartoon character. The real Mrs. Child possessed a warm and extroverted temperament, yes, but she was not a clown; she was a sharp-thinking, determined person, as her body of work clearly demonstrates.

I am not surprised to learn that Mrs. Child herself was offended by the blog that took center-stage in this movie, a self-indulgent YAWN written by an uninteresting girl who connives to capitalize on a famous name to call attention to her banal musings. Is the blogger so hip and ultra-evolved that she cannot realize there are still a few people left on this earth who consider irreverence and cheekiness repellent? I was particularly offended by the line, ""The b**** lied."" Back in the day, this type of remark was called an ""insult.""

I feel this movie portrayed Louisette Bertholle in an excessively negative light, in perhaps a Hollywood attempt to provide added ""meat"" to a mediocre script. While there were disagreements and minor contractual disputes among the three co-authors of MASTERING THE ART OF FRENCH COOKING, it is my understanding that they were resolved amicably --not in the snarky and mean-spirited manner shown in this movie. By most accounts, the late Mrs. Bertholle was an exceedingly lovely and gracious woman --a lady-- and I cannot help but think that this movie besmirches her and must sadden her surviving family.",1395100800,,2383,4.821515892420538

3975472,5,B002RSDW80,"While Julia Childs is a bit before my time, the character Julie, a cubicle bureaucrat working the complaint desk after the World Trade Center bombings is a contemporary urban American.  Why I identify with her cooking/blogging enterprise as a stress management mechanism is maybe too much information.

There's an interesting book titled:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Standing-in-the-Rainbow-Ballantine-Reader-s-Circle/dp/0345452887/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Standing in the Rainbow (Ballantine Reader's Circle)</a>&nbsp;,  about a character whose loss of a child compells her to undertake many, many, baking jobs, even purveying her recipe sharing and tips to others over a local county radio talk show.  It's not about trying to get fat.  It's all about digging in with both hands and savoring the goodness in life.

I'm not going to spoil some cooking pointers from Julia I picked up from watching Meryl Streep's delightful portrayal of her living and learning French cooking.  It was fun to watch and inspirational.  Whereas Biblical bookish love centers around a verb of loving God with all your commanded self control, there's so much more to love.  It's endemic in the thought from James' epistle, that ""every good and perfect gift is from above...""  I love this story.",1392768000,3,1323,5.87958115183246
3975473,5,B002RSDW80,"Yes, Meryl Streep is brilliant, and this might be one of her best roles. I can't think of anyone who could have done it nearly as well. Yes, Amy Adams is super cute, sweet and sexy. Yes, Stanley Tucci almost stole the show even in this cast, which is saying a lot.

But it's not just the acting. This movie is very well written, with a lot of snappy dialogue, heartwarming moments, and character development. The directing and editing are good and put together what could have been confusing if mishandled.

What really puts it over the top though is that the story is positive and uplifting, especially in its depiction of marriage. These days you usually get the message that ""marriage sucks"" but here we see two examples of happy, healthy, even wonderful marriages where the two love and support each other even when its hard. Things are never perfect, but there's enough conflict for a story right there. You don't need to dump a bunch of soap opera stupidity on top of that to make it interesting.

3975531,5,B002RSDW80,"I have to admit that when I first heard about 'Julie & Julia"" I was a bit skeptical. How could a movie about one person making all the recipes in a famous chef's cookbook and blogging about it make for an interesting movie, one that was going to hold my attention throughout? I soon found out.

First, both Meryl Streep (who, through a few photographic tricks manages to look far taller than she is in real life) and Amy Adams play the parts of Julia Child and Julie Powell to perfection. The talented Streep somehow manages to capture both the voice and the mannerisms of the famous chef to perfection. At the same time Adams convincingly plays the part of a somewhat unsure of herself but determined young woman who has set herself the goal of making all the recipes in the cookbook (some of which take a considerable amount of time), blogging about them, while at the same time holding onto her job in a federal agency in New York. (The tension that this creates in Julie's life and between her and her husband is well captured.)

Second, the food is mouthwatering. It made me want to find a French restaurant where I could try some of the dishes portrayed on the screen.

Finally, the director, Nora Ephron, was able to cut from Julia to Julie and back at all the appropriate times, making sure that we captured what was going on with one or the other of them, but at the same time not focusing on either of them for so long as for the scene to become tedious.

All in all, this is a movie definitely worth watching, even if you're not into French food.",1382313600,2,1557,4.395833333333333

3975534,5,B002RSDW80,"Even though I had never heard of Julia Child before I came to the USA 22 years ago, I soon learned about her. Being interested in food and recipes, I bought both volumes of Mastering the Art of French Cooking as well as Julia Child's My Life in France, upon which half of this story is based. Although I saw Julie Powell's blog, I was not a regular reader; something put me off - maybe it was the self-absorption, the cuss words, or her hatred of Republicans. No matter! I nearly didn't buy this movie but my daughter suggested that I should. I am glad she did! Meryl Streep's portrayal of the joyful, boisterous Julia had me believing she really was Julia Child. Amy Adams as a cute-as-a-button Julie Powell was probably nicer than the real Julie, if review comments are to be believed. Most of all, though, I fell in love with both their warm, supportive husbands! Be warned that there are one or two earthy moments, and the odd swear word, but it did not spoil my enjoyment of this tale of two romances wrapped up in a foodie's delight.",1381276800,,1039,4.416666666666667

This is such a dear, sweet heart of a movie.  Fix a pot of coffee, sit back and enjoy.  The photography is lush.  The music score de-lovely.  The story is endearing.  Julia would be pleased.

It was fun to see the two lives in parallel as the younger Julie attempts to cook through Julia Child's cookbook.  Stan Tucci as Paul Child was brilliant, too.

Groundbreaking cookbook and a blogger who will cook Julia Childs dishes from her cookbook everyday for a year. Meryl Streep in one of her best roles portrays Julia Child in the late 1940's to the mid 1950's when she and her husband lived in France and discovered her passion for French food. Forward almost 50 years later and a blogger (Amy Adams) decides to cook every one of Julia's recipes in her cookbook. It has a charming story and superb acting by all. Stanley Tucci is Julia's loving and supportive husband. Jane Lynch is Julia's sister Dorothy who is just as fun in the role! What a great story that is light hearted and interesting! A great movie that I highly recommend and say....Bon Apetit!!!!,1377216000,2,804,4.709219858156028

3975545,5,B002RSDW80,This was recommended to me and I did not see it at the movies and it was cheap so I tried it. I was good!!! I enjoyed it!!!,1376438400,,123,3.4285714285714284
3975546,5,B002RSDW80,Amy Adams is adorable.  Meryl Streep turns in a performance worthy of - Meryl Streep - and the story is masterfully woven between the two worlds.  I laughed.  I cried.  I burped.,1376265600,,178,4.46875
3975547,5,B002RSDW80,"I ordered a used copy of Julia Child's book, and gave the cookbook and movie as a Christmas gift.  My daughter (age 40) loved the gift and the whole family watched the movie together that very night with several other visiting nieces and nephews and they all loved it even the younger ones that I thought would be off playing...they came in and sat through the whole movie and loved it too.",1376006400,,390,4.416666666666667

3975550,5,B002RSDW80,This is a most entertaining movie and I thoroughly enjoyed it.  I highly recommend it - especially the interaction between the Julie(ia) and their husbands.,1374796800,,156,5.24
3975551,5,B002RSDW80,"What can I say about Meryl Streep that hasn't been said?  What can't this woman do???  She should have definitely won the Oscar for this performance,... witty, determined, fiesty and surprisingly sensual.  For those who know her (Julia Child's) story know that food may have been her passion, but her husband Paul was her love.  They simply adored each other, and this is so sweetly portrayed in this movie...you would never think of this movie as a love story, but their love was so strong, it really is a large part of the movie....and should be.  I know the ""Julie"" story has taken a lot of criticism as being the weaker of two parts....duh!!!!!  What did you expect going against Meryl Streep and Stanley Tucci?  Amy Adams was in this inenviable position and yes, while she was a bit shallow and whiny at times (no thanks to the writers), she did the best she could.  Having a (yummy!!) Chris Messina doesn't hurt though.  Final analysis:  This movie is NOT a rental....it's a movie for everyone's collection.",1374364800,2,1013,4.704545454545454

3975553,5,B002RSDW80,"Well I don't do spoilers EVER. Streep was perfect as Julia Child. I like the fact that the movie was touching w/o being mushy, and the fact that the movie was very real and honest in it's portrayals. I was totally inspired by the movie and plan on cooking my way thru Julia's book (at a much slower pace mind you).
I really loved the extras! Extras and bonus content really justify purchasing DVD's and Blurays and this one was great. I especially enjoyed the cooking lessons:)",1373760000,,477,4.494252873563219
3975554,5,B002RSDW80,"I trust enough have seen or heard about this movie to go over the plot, but I did watch it with, and then without, the commentary which I always find very informative. It was the director Nora Ephron who did the commentary and spoke of problems with various scenes, the professional attitude of Meryl Streep, how the actress who played JUlie Powell never cooked another lobster after making this movie, and how the actors in it, when agreeing to accept the roles, understood it would mean eating, and eating, and eating, and eating. I might put in a plug for the real Julie Powell who was called some unflattering names, but what she did in preparing each and every dish in Mastering The Art of French Cooking I would like to see them try! No, I did not buy the cookbook, nor My Life in France, but I did buy both for my sister. I did buy Julia Child's Cats and loved it, and the movie also got me to buy Dearie which, while it is a very large book, turned out to be an easy read. This movie I have seen countless times, along with the behind-the-scenes feature as well. Even if you don't enjoy cooking (I do) you ought to give it a try if you haven't already seen it. To watch two stories intertwine is fascinating, even if they were decades apart. It was sad that Julie never met Julia face to face, but at least in tackling such a formidable project, Julie learned to cook.",1373155200,3,1376,4.316602316602316

3975561,4,B002RSDW80,I read the book a long time ago and just never got around to watching the movie.  But I really enjoyed it.  I think Meryl did a great job playing Julia.  And who doesn't love Julia Child?  I'll watch it again soon!,1370563200,,214,4.023809523809524
3975562,2,B002RSDW80,"Okay....I don't really ""loath"" the character Julie in this film, but I would have rather that the film had simply told Julia Child's life story.  I loved the parts of the film that dealt with Ms. Childs' life.  But the character Julie was a whiny, shallow, incompetent little girl who did nothing worthwhile, and said nothing the least bit interesting, insightful or entertaining. I do not recommend this movie to anyone, except as a soporific for insomniacs.",1370044800,2,459,4.9480519480519485

3975566,3,B002RSDW80,As a teacher I thought this would be perfect to show in my hs culinary classes. The wonderful techniques and both characters' passion for their craft would be an inspiration to students.. Unfortunately I could not show it due to the one line where Meryl Streep states the manicotti are hotter than a stiff cock. One line ruins a great teaching tool.,1367625600,,349,4.645161290322581
3975567,5,B002RSDW80,"I love this movie and have watched it many times. I never knew so much about Julia Child, until I watched this movie. Meryl Streep was perfect for the part.

An excellent movie, and I would recommend it to all my friends and family.",1367452800,,337,4.265625
3975568,4,B002RSDW80,"I'm pretty much satisfied with this item - the only thing I was disappointed about was that it's a blu-ray, but it's in a DVD case...so my  OCD self is upset that it doesn't match with the rest of my blu-rays.

3975569,5,B002RSDW80,I love this movie. Meryl Streep and Amy Adams really brought these characters together. The fact that I'm not really a good cook made me want to buy Julia Childs cookbook.,1366588800,,171,4.548387096774194
3975570,5,B002RSDW80,"My husband and I love watching cooking shows on Create TV:  Julia Child, Jacques Pepin, et al.  We decided to take a chance and watch this film.  It was intriguing to consider how Meryl Streep would portray and carry off the iconic Julia.  We were not disappointed.  This embodied the Joy of Cooking, to mix a title.  We were actually surprised how  much we liked it.  I actually tried the boeuf burginon recipe after watching Susan Goin's cooking lesson on the topic (sp?), and wow, it was beyond my expectations.
I had heard the movie was ""okay"" but actually it was 5 stars.",1366416000,,576,4.524271844660194

3975574,5,B002RSDW80,This is a wonderful movie! funny. very entertaining. just a very enjoyable movie to watch. I am so happy that I bought a copy of it here on Amazon. After watching the movie I also purchased Julia's french cookbook that is mentioned in this movie (the combined full version of it). this movie will make you hungry! :),1365465600,,316,4.4655172413793105

3975576,5,B002RSDW80,"This is a wonderfully good movie that is based on fact.  The biggest problem is the hunger that you will have for French food after about 30 minutes.  It is a love story, a story of the realities of life in a big city and also internationally, it is a story about a love of food, and a story that crosses generations (although it is NOT for children, there is some adult language that is used, for the most part, quite appropriately).

Highly recommend.",1365379200,,453,4.369047619047619
3975577,5,B002RSDW80,"The story of Julie and Julia is wonderful.  I'm not a cook, but it's always been fun watching Julia do her French cooking.  And beyond that, it was special one evening long ago when I was having supper in Seattle with Jeff Smith, the Frugal Gourmet, we discovered that Julia and friend were eating right behind us.  So Jeff had her meet us - what a wonderful delight!

And to watch Julie and her patient husband work together putting up a French cooking idea based on ideas for Julia Childs makes the whole story lots of fun.  So I can't recommend this book or the DVD show too highly!",1365206400,,585,4.330275229357798

Neither Julia or Julie got it right the first time.  Julia Child set so many important presidents. Today's beginning cooks should all learn who she is and what she did.  However, we do also discuss the limiting of her rich recipes to occasionally rather than a steady diet.",1365033600,,436,4.468354430379747
3975579,5,B002RSDW80,"OK, straight up, the movie isn't perfect. Especially if you know anything of the real person behind it, well, its not entirely convincing (for a movie based on real people.)

That said, it has a delightful and always beautiful Amy Adams, and impeccable Stanley Tucci at his finest, and ...

Meryl Streep.

She is more than a scene stealer, she steals the whole movie. Her Julia Child is fantastic, utterly believable, full of emotion and vitality (and a touch of pathos.)

3975581,2,B002RSDW80,"My review is in regards to the MOVIE PLUS SHOPPING BAG distribution.  First, I will say I loved the movie and in fact have ended up with I believe 4 copies of it.  The release of the movie with the shopping bag was one I coveted but could not bring myself to buy at the original price when it was first offered.  SO, I PUT IT OFF.  I rechecked the item off and on and finally it was offered for $14.99 so I ordered it.  I DON'T KNOW IF THE ORIGINAL OFFER INCLUDED A DECENT QUALITY SHOPPING BAG BUT I CAN TELL YOU ABOUT THE BAG I RECEIVED at the less expensive price.  The bag was in its own plastic see through package affixed inside a second see through package along with the DVD.  On opening my newly acquired purchase, excited to see my new SHOPPING BAG I was immediately disappointed.  The purchase even at the reduced price, in my estimation, was not a good one. DESCRIPTION:  the bag is square in shape when folded closed and it opens into one that measures 12"" in height, 12"" in width and 4"" in depth at the opening, the same 4"" all the way down the inside.  The two carry straps add an additional 9"" to the overall length. What the material is I haven't a clue as there is no tag of any kind that I can discover and I turned it inside out looking.  The material is a close weave and might pass for a light weight canvas cloth, somewhat shiny so maybe it's a nylon.  There is no aromatic smell so no clue to the fabric via the nose.  It's actual weight might be about as much as a pot holder.  It is sewn well, I'll give it that much positive comment.  It is nicely seamed so without any real info I would say it couldn't have been made in the USA but somewhere in Asia where most of our sewing is now done AND I'M NOT LAUGHING.  If your intent is to use the bag for grocery shopping, I would line it first with two cuts of cardboard for strength. QUANTITY EXAMPLE thinking of breakfast: it could carry possibly 5 nice oranges on the bottom and next a dozen eggs then a loaf of bread, FOUR 1# bacon slabs (THREE FOR THE FREEZER) on either side to reinforce them for carrying and maybe a few more very small items. I will use it for packing picnic sandwiches and chips.  ""CLASSY"" is not a word I can use for this bag but if you want to spend your money on the movie WITH THE SHOPPING BAG, and I would not purchase the bag for more than a dollar at a garage sale, I am arming you with the details of the item beforehand.  Maybe the quality was there when the combination was first offered ???  GIFT GIVING, THE MOVIE will make a wonderful gift, it's the part of this combination purchase worth every penny of the spending.",1364601600,,2628,4.137795275590551
3975582,5,B002RSDW80,"I loved Julia Child and this movie is an homage to her.  Great performances throughout.  Meryl Streep is great as usual, but so is Stanley Tucci.",1364428800,,145,4.538461538461538
3975583,5,B002RSDW80,"I have seen this movie at least a half dozen times now and still enjoy it immensely.  It inspired me to go out and read both the book it is based upon re Julie (same title) and the other book the screenplay is based upon re Julia, ""My Life in France.""  I must admit that I liked the movie better than the book it was based on, but very much enjoyed ""My Life In France.""  Perhaps this is reflective of the fact that, in the movie, I enjoyed the half that revolved around Julia much more than that of Julie.

The basis of the movie is that Julie is going through some rough times in her life.  She's always wanted to be a writer, but ended up doing mind-numbing frustrating office work.  She can never seem to finish anything or come to much in her life, especially since she is reaching that 30 year milestone.  However, she does love to cook.  Hence the idea of cooking her way through Julia's massive tome in only one year and blogging about it.  The other half of the movie is about Julia and her husband as they go to France during the late 40's and how she comes to learn to cook and to write her first cookbook.  Plus the trials and tribulations of getting someone to publish it.

Meryl is wonderful as Julia.  She moves, talks, and walks like her and the love between Julia and her husband (who works in the foreign services, which is where they met) is incredible and charming.

I'm far less enamoured of the half of the story about Julie.  She tends to whine a lot and isn't very charming...at least by comparison.  I think if she had learned more than cooking from Julia in the movie it would have been a better ending.  There are hints of this, but it could have been emphasized a bit more.

Still, I'd recommend the movie, especially for anyone who loves to cook or read about cooking or watch cooking shows.",1364256000,,1819,4.287390029325513
3975584,4,B002RSDW80,The entertainment was all that I anticipated. I thought the price a little high since I could have watched it on TV for free. The delivery was impeccable.

3975585,3,B002RSDW80,"The scenes with Meryl Streep as Julia Child and Stanley Tucci as Paul Child are fantastic, if a bit honeyed and glowing, and well worth buying the DVD for if you're a Child fan.  The scenes with Amy Adams, Chris Messina, and their twenty/thirtysomething friends are stale, dull, and irritatingly interrupt the beautifully-acted story of Julia Child's life.  Child thought Julie's Powell's blog was an uninteresting stunt; you'll find Child's judgment duly vindicated in the ""Julie"" half of the film.  That's why it gets 3 stars from me, but it's still worth watching.",1363910400,,567,5.075268817204301

So, as both a wanna-be cook and childhood admirer of Child, I was merely curious about how Streep would portray Julia . . . and was very pleasantly surprised, all around.  Not only does Streep do an outstanding job as the grand old dame, but the entire film turns out to be something even us Red River/Fort Apache addicts enjoyed.

Both Julie and Julia are played incredibly believably making this film one for the Classics shelf.  Meryl Streep is at her best, playing Julia Childs with uncanny credulity, and the cooking and the romantic challenges intertwine to form a well developed, well acted, and well done film in all aspects.  Thoroughly enjoyable, and extremely well directed and acted.  Really funny parts as well.  Love it!!!",1359936000,,512,4.816091954022989

3975611,4,B002RSDW80,"In the wrong hands, Julie & Julia could have been a pointless waste of time, but director Nora Ephron makes it work. The main reason is the casting, and the presence of Meryl Streep.

If you have paid attention to Streep over the course of her career, you'll know that she is effective in serious dramas, comedy, and anything else she tries. Unlike many good actresses, she's different in every film. She becomes the character. That's true again in Julie & Julia as she transforms herself into Julia Child. You might find her character's voice a bit annoying, but it's incredibly close to the voice of the real Julia Child. The film works because she will make you care whether she achieves her ambition to get her book published.

Amy Adams teamed up with Streep in Doubt, and the contrast between the two characters worked wonderfully. The two don't appear in any scenes together this time because the film is split into two stories. The first tells Julia's story, showing how she lived in Paris, took a cooking class, and ultimately wrote a book on the subject. The other story begins in New York in 2002, and shows how Julie Powell (Adams) seeks something to add meaning to her life. Her job is boring, and she lives in a small apartment in Queens, located above a Pizzeria.

Julie's life changes when husband Eric (Messina) encourages her to begin a blog. She eventually comes up with the idea of writing about cooking, and vows to make 524 recipes from Julia's cookbook over the course of a year. If any of you have a blog of your own, you'll identify with Julie in this segment. It shows her writing every day, wondering if anyone is actually reading. She's desperate for comments and feedback of any kind, and wonders if the effort is worth it. Although her main goal is to give her something to do, she's hoping for recognition, and possibly more. She's already written a novel, but nobody wants to publish it. Can she turn her project into a commercial success?

One thing the film does well is establish its characters. They are complex human beings, and we feel as if we know them after two hours. Both women have supportive partners, and I particularly love the relationship between Julia and her husband, Paul (Tucci). It looks like the two actors have been married to each other for years. It's clear that Paul played a significant role in Julia's success, inspiring her to try new things and stick with her plan to write a book. Julie and Eric are also in a believable relationship. You can see how society has changed over the past few decades; Julie and Eric both work, while Paul supports Julia financially, allowing her time to explore other things.

There's a fair amount of situational humor in the film, and it works well without seeming forced. My favorite Julia scene involves onions, and Paul's reaction to her competitive nature. As for Julie, the placement of Talking Heads' Psycho Killer when she's cooking lobsters is just about perfect.

Julie & Julia turned out to be Nora Ephron's last film, and it's a good one. Streep's Oscar nomination was deserved, and the other main characters all play their parts well. This is the kind of film that will keep you smiling, and it has plenty of replay value. Maybe it will help you discover your own purpose in life, or at least explain why you keep working on your blog?",1358553600,,3343,4.648054145516075

3975613,5,B002RSDW80,This is by far one a new favorite. I enjoy cooking and was intrigued by this movie. I love how the story goes between Julia Childs and Julie the blogger. I have often thought it would be fun to have a cooking blog so I really enjoyed how this played out. I guess I could relate to Julie and her struggles to get the recipes right. If you like Julia Childs or just like cooking in general you will enjoy this movie!,1358294400,,414,4.060975609756097

Plus Meryl and Amy rock this... I know reviews say Amy is whiney in this movie, but that's how the auther is! I went out & bought the book afterwards and this is one of the few times I say the movie is better.  Oh and Jane Lynch nails it too... and Stanley Tucci!",1357948800,,443,4.034090909090909

It was also fun to watch Julie learn to cook, creating the more notable recipes in one year. It was just a fun relaxing movie so I picked a rating of 4 Stars. I agree with some comments that the Julia Childs side of the movie, could have been a movie unto itself, espcially with Meryl Streep and Stan Tucci playing the roles. I thought they were both great, just as in ""The Devil Wears Prada"". Not too much I didn't like about the movie.",1357516800,,551,4.158878504672897

This film parallels the lives of two people in such a seamlessly cleaver way that it is a joy to watch. It is an homage to the brilliant and innovative Julia Child (a hero to all serious home cooks) through the eyes of a modern young woman. A charming and uplifting movie, One of my all-time favorites. If you like to cook, admire Julia Child, or just want a good story, you will like this movie.",1357344000,,514,4.309278350515464

After 30 minutes I could see that the movie wasn't really going in any particular direction, and it lacked focus. After an hour I couldn't watch any more I was so bored!

3975625,4,B002RSDW80,"I saw this movie awhile back and bought it for my mother in-law who is into cooking after she retired. I have always been a Meryl Streep fan and personally liked Amy Adams quite a bit. However, when I watched the film, I was really fascinated by all of the Julia Child's part and got more and more irritated by the other protagonist, Julie Powell. Amy Adams remains to be a wonderful actress, but all of the whines and complains of Julie Powell are just annoying. I loved how Julia Child's uplifting spirit just brightens up the film and wish it's just about her alone!",1356998400,,569,4.428571428571429
3975626,4,B002RSDW80,The interplay between the Julie and Julia's characters is both funny and revealing.  It shows a lot about how two different people approached life and solved the problems they faced.  Meryl Streep is again amazing at how she loses herself in the character.  This is worth buying just to see her portrayal of Julia Child but the whole cast lends works in making this movie a little hidden gem to brighten anyones day.,1356825600,,416,4.671232876712328
3975627,5,B002RSDW80,She is extraordinary. She never overawes the screen but melds into it. She IS the character she plays. I could see this film again and again and still be delighted.,1356652800,,164,4.5

3975630,5,B002RSDW80,Meryl Streep as Julia Child and Stanley Tucci as her husband is what sold me on the movie.  Their performances stole the show. Julie and her husband did not even have to be in the movie for me to enjoy it.,1356048000,,205,4.0
3975631,5,B002RSDW80,Meryl Streep was so good in this as Julia. She is such a good actress and she nailed Julia Childs. What an actress and what a great movie.,1356048000,,138,3.9642857142857144
3975632,3,B002RSDW80,"This film is, somehow, neither fish nor fowl.

The premise isn't bad, and the Julia Child memoire portion has genuine bio-pic interest.  Yet, overall, the script isn't strong enough to carry a two hour film, and the one-note point of the epic effort to make all of the recipes in a single year - itself rather admirable, and clearly an act that ends up being an homage to Ms. Child even if it didn't necessarily start that way - just doesn't have quite enough meat to it.  The scenes in Paris make you want to go there.  The sets are quite beautiful, as is the food.  The script relies on many cliches.  The dialogue is sometimes rather stiff. Meryl Streep's impression of Julia Child is a hoot at times, at other times somewhat forced.

The film is informative.  It is in some ways uplifting.
In the hands of Neil Simon it could have been informative, uplifting, and funny.",1355529600,,874,4.487341772151899

Although I cant remember if there was any colorful language in it. Julia Child lived in Massachusetts where I am from and her kitchen (since her death) is in the smithsonian.

That is not the fault of Amy Adams, who does a marvelous job for the part of Julie.  But what interests me is Julia, not Julie, and Meryl Streep owns the part.

3975654,4,B002RSDW80,"Julie and Julia is a fun, lighthearted story of two women who found themselves by discovering food. I live in Pasadena, California, the city where Julia Child was born and raised. Although Julia found herself while living in Paris during a time in history where few women worked, she started a food revolution. No more Spam and Bisquick, but she actually taught women how to cook French food where ever they lived- without servants. Julie on the other hand admired Julia so much she created a blog about cooking one of Julia's recipes each day for a year. Although the two never met,, both women found purpose in their lives through food. 2012 marks Julia Child's 100th birthday in Pasadena, and the city is CELEBRATING one of their own this month with many local restaurants cooking Julia's food to honor her as well as city celebrations. Julia really made a difference. So did Julie as her blog and the movie based on it brought Julia to life as never before. I remember seeing Julia on television but I never really knew her.

3975656,3,B002RSDW80,"Overall, I enjoyed this movie a lot more than I thought I would. It surprised me. And I like to be surprised, pleasantly, by a movie.
The story follows two women, in their separated by time and location, as they struggle to find some sort of meaning to their lives. Finding something that they loved, and felt good doing, turned out to be cooking, for both of them. Well, cooking and writing about it. Julia ended up writing a cookbook, while Julie wrote a blog about cooking Julia's recipes.
It was very interesting to learn more about Julia Childs's life. She seemed like a fearless woman, braving a French professional cooking school, and being the only woman. I had no idea she went through so much just to get her cookbook published. And I can't imagine having to hand type it using carbon paper! Oh, my! It took 8 years to get her book published. Insane!
And very interesting to watch Julie struggle to go through over 500 recipes in a year! I can't imagine! But what a way to tranform your cooking skills!
I'm not sure I would call this movie a ""Romantic"" movie. Sure there is romance, but that is more like a subplot, and not the main story.
If Amazon did half stars I'd give this a solid 3.5. So I'm stuck with 3.
Great feel good movie (you feel good at the end). A little slow in parts with the pacing. Not much of a fan of Nora Ephron's. I liked this more than Sleepless in Seattle though.
And I would buy this for my collection. An excellent movie to watch when you want to vege out, or you've just spent the day in the kitchen cooking!",1343433600,,1548,4.323024054982818

They are both so pleasurable to watch.

I felt compelled to watch Julie and Julia over and over again. This movie is better than an upper; it simply transports you to a happier place and time; the second disk allows you to see Julia herself in action as she was on tv!  Unfortunately, I missed Julia when she was alive and on the first home tv cooking show but now I can enjoy her whenever I'd like. I am not a fan a French food (I'm an Asian foodie) but she provided me, an experienced cook, with some good new ideas for making food better.

The first time we discoved it was in watching The Help, and it was what I call simply AMAZON amazing!!!!  We didn't have to stop the movie every other second to answer one question after another!!!  He went from asking what was literally over 100 questions each movie to clarifying one thing in the middle and that was it.  Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh.....we could breathe easy and watch the movie in relative peace and joy.  So now, I search each time I can for a new movie that has DVS and purchase it at Amazon.  Julie and Julia has this service (you find it where the subtitles are under language in set up).  We watched it Mother's Day weekend and both my parents went on and on about what a great movie it was and what a Godsend (literally) the DVS service is.  So, thank you DVS powers that be, and Amazon for allowing us to enjoy for the first time in years a movie, and now eight!  Just make sure you have a snack ready while viewing Julie and Julia as it will make you hungry for sure.  Ha!",1339113600,3,1538,4.369718309859155
3975661,3,B002RSDW80,"The parts of this movie with Streep as Julia Child are a real treat.  Wonderful!  I was inspired by Julia's personality, by the love and respect in her marriage.  I cried when she got the letter from her sister -- my husband and I are going through the same thing, and my heart ached for her.  She had a truly fascinating life.

The parts with Julie, however.....By the end of the movie, I really despised Julie's character.  She was so self-centered, pathetically mistreating her loving and supportive husband to the point of driving him away.  She hangs out with horrible friends, wonders why she hates her friends, but never goes out and makes new friends.  I got the feeling that even the actress couldn't quite stomach her role's patheticness.  When she was interviewed in the newspaper, and received all those phone calls from publishers, I wasn't happy for her.  I was cheesed off.  She didn't deserve any of it, and I don't blame Julia Child for not endorsing her.  When she has the dinner party with her friends, and steals Julia Child's husband's toast, it enraged me.  There is no character growth.  She's the same whiny ingrate at the end of the movie as she was at the beginning.

(Not so) shockingly, when I looked up her book on Wikipedia, I learned that after her book was published, she cheated on her husband.  And then she wrote about it.  And published another book, all about the affair!!  What the hell is wrong with this woman????  Granted, an affair (and then writing a book about it) is completely in line with her pathetic self-centered attention-seeking character, but did she learn nothing from when she drove her husband away earlier??

I am completely conflicted.  Because the parts with Julia Child are wonderful and deserve 5 stars and I want to buy the movie to watch these parts again.  But that means having to sit through the horrible Julie parts as well!

 It is the 1940's. Julia Child (Meryl Streep) and her husband Paul Child (Stanley Tucci) have just arrived in Paris, France. They are deeply in love. He has a job at the embassy. She decides she wants to learn how to cook professionally at Le Cordon Bleu.

 In 2002, Julie (Amy Adams) and her husband, Eric Powell (Chris Messina) move into their new residence in New York City. It is above a pizzeria and next to a factory.
  By day, she is a government employee who takes phone calls of complaints and problems. Her hobby is cooking and her husband likes what she cooks.

 As the movie follows the life of Julia Child, we also follow the story of Julie who has decided to cook her way through Julia Child's ""Mastering the Art of French Cooking"" cookbook and write a blog about her experience for a full year.

 Delightful film!  Meryl Streep makes this film fun to watch.
  If you are in the baby boomer generation, you probably remember seeing Julia Child on the PBS cable stations in her cooking show, The French Chef (1963-73). It was also shown for many years in re-runs and currently on the Cooking Channel.

Did you know Julia Child was actually born in Pasadena, California, USA?

 Julia Child passed away August 13, 2004 at the age of 91.",1332806400,,1561,4.7565543071161045
3975664,5,B002RSDW80,"For those of you who love to cook, this is an amazing movie. Meryl Streep is magnificant! And I like Amy Adams in almost every she's done- there's just something about her... Nora Ephron, the director/writer, does a fabulous job of bringing two very different worlds together. I highly recommend this movie, but be warned- I'm always hungry somewhere in the middle, so have a yummy snack handy!

It is inspiring, clean, and true. Why can't there be more movies like this one!! Don't hesitate to buy this movie if you like to feel good and be inspired.",1330214400,,306,3.723076923076923
3975668,5,B002RSDW80,"A conductor stands poised, baton at the ready, before his orchestra. A surgeon takes that steadying breath, scalpel in hand. A teacher stands before a class of eager, boisterous behavior under control. What marvels will unfold in each scenario?

It's that beginning, that initial moment, knowing--in advance--the great effort of the task to come, that leads ""Julie and Julia"" to fruition. And, oh, that opening moment, that promise of richness of story, can lead only to great satisfaction or disappointment. ""Julie and Julia"" did it for me! This is a movie to love! I have gone on and on to family and friends about how much I love this movie!

Where to begin? Obviously, Meryl Streep as Julia Child should not have received a penny for her acting--she too much enjoyed getting into that role, giving the viewer a truly great performance. Julia Child loved life! Everywhere she went, with everyone she met, with every experience, she brought herself, bigger than life, and oh, so much fun! Meryl Streep gives us a portrait of that woman. It's an amazing performance!

Julie Powell conceived of the perfect idea for a book: Cook Julia Childs! No, not literally. Julie cooked her way through Julia Childs' magnus opus: ""French Cooking"" written for American women who wanted to explore the cooking techniques of the French chef, yet knowing she could never go to cooking school.

That takes us to France, her husband, a diplomat, and French cooking. Julia Child was very happily married to Paul Child. In fact, this plain-looking, big-boned woman married at age 49, at which age she had experienced sex exactly zero times. But, according to the movie, oh, how she made up for it, including noon delights. (If this topic seems out of character for Julia Child, you would be wrong--it's quite pertinent!) As for Stanley Tucci, again, he gives a wonderful performance. He is one over-looked actor at awards time!

The book is written in alternate stories: that of Julia and the writing of ""Mastering the Art of French Cooking"" and that of Julie, a young married woman who wanted to distinguish herself as a solid writer. She conceives of a blog in which she details how to cook the French way, following the famous Child methods. Then, we see Julia learning how to cook French and adapting that to her own inimitable style.

The film follows Julie's story for the one year it took to prepare all the recipes in the book. Julia's story covers several years and the writing and cooking that make up the book.

I absolutely loved this movie. Not only is Meryl Streep excellent, but also Amy Adams as Julie. What poetic license Julie inserts in this a true story is inconsequential: the story remains the same--an accounting of two lives: one who lived joie de vivre, who challenged the status quo, and one who faced obstacles and overcame each one, whether with pluck or defiance or joy.

Next reading assignment: the book, that is, both of the books!",1329004800,3,2943,4.813861386138614
3975669,4,B002RSDW80,"this was a well done effort with cutting between two stories.  one the story of a modern day blogger who is cooking each one of julia child's recipes for an entire year and blogging about it daily.  the blog becomes a huge hit.  the other half of the story is julia child and her husband in 1949 France.  He was and is a spy for the CIA and I have read that she also worked for the CIA.  However, she loved cooking more than anything.

Child's fascinating story, with the wonderful Stanley Tucci playing her lifelong husband Paul whetted my appetite for seeing that entire story with Streep as Child and Tucci as Paul.  i felt every time we cut back to the other story that we were seeing a romcom (romantic comedy) instead.  tucci and streep were making one movie and the other movie was director nora ephron's typical contemporary woman's story with plenty of female bonding and romcom elements (I have a very hard time with a lot of her work with this romcom emphasis that borders on too cutesy for words).  By the time we got to the end of Powell's story, I was just about sick of her and her friends.  I also would have cut Powell's friends from the story entirely.  They added nothing.  However, I can't give it less than 4 stars because the Child part of the story is simply marvelous.

However, if you're willing to accept some ""artistic license"" in the movie than I fully believe you'll love it. I'm a librarian by day, and amateur gourmet chef by night. I love cooking and this is actually one of my favorite movies to pop in while making a pie (my specialty!) or enjoying a rainy afternoon. Meryl Streep delivers a Julia Child that is shockingly realistic. Amy Adams fully captures the charm and somewhat childish nature of Julie Powell. Fabulous actors like Stanley Tucci are just a bonus to the overall package. The only reason I gave the movie four instead of five stars is that there are a few scenes from the book that I really loved that were not included. Overall, a wonderful movie with a wonderful cast that I will enjoy for many wonderful years to come.",1326326400,,943,4.52046783625731
3975671,3,B002RSDW80,"I knew nothing about Julia Child, Julie Powell or either of their life stories before I watched this movie. I absolutely loved the incredible Meryl Streep and her wonderful and joyful portrayal of Julia Child! It made me want to learn more about Julia Child, look up her cookbooks and even try out a recipe or two. Ms. Child seemed to have quite a fascinating, full, adventurous life, from her world travels to her marriage to her cookbook publishing, etc. Ms. Child seemed like a person I would love to meet and have dinner with some day. Her life was very inspiring to me. Now, Julie Powell? Not so much. Ms. Powell comes across as a self-absorbed, whiny narcissist whose so-called ""accomplishment"" is nothing more than attempting to gain recognition for herself by following a lot recipes written by someone else in what would best be described as an attention-seeking stunt.  I feel sorry for Ms. Child that this movie was made this way. Julia Child deserved a biographical movie made about her -- and her alone -- without the interspersing the ""story"" of a rather immature woman whose only claim to fame is being a blogger who tried to follow a bunch of Julia Child's recipes. If you google Julie Powell, you will see that some of her blogs are still on the web -- full of profanity, misspellings, and yes, more whining. Poor Julia Child -- no wonder she was no fan of Ms. Powell and her blog.",1326240000,,1398,4.592

3975674,4,B002RSDW80,"Before I saw the movie I listened to an Audio book of Julie Powell's Book.  It was interesting to me because I like to cook and my friends usually turn to me for cooking advice and look forward to anything I make.  I was, however.  a bit disturbed by her fowl language, even though I am younger than her.  I'd disagree with anyone who says that is how people talk these days - if that is how ""they"" talk ""they "" shouldn't speak or write for or to others.  Thankfully this language is basically completely missing from the film and Amy Adam's portrayal of Julie Powell is far more likeable than I imagine the real Powell is.  Unfortunately I have a hard time believing that she actually made all of the aspics or that honesty is important to her.  After all she didn't even ask her mom for Julia Child's cookbook - she stole it from her own mother.  After her book was published and before the movie came out she had an affair on her ""sainted"" husband and she seems to not appreciate her fans.  Probably the only part of the movie that resembles her true life is the part where she is self centered.  All of this of course is good because a movie based on the real Julie Powell would be boring and irritating.  Meryl Strep is amazing simply amazing - when you think of how different this character is from the ""Devil"" and from the equally opinionated nun she played in Doubt, it is truly incredible.  I would give this film 5 stars but, it isn't a movie that is going to have universal appeal.  It will mostly appeal to foodies and people who are already fans of Julia Child but for those who like it - they will really like it.  The Julia Child part is really a love story and a very touching one unlike the shame of a marriage Powell apparently has.",1325030400,,1750,4.279635258358662

Really, give this a pass.  No story, no character development, no plot - just like a blog.

As much am I'm loathe to criticise Streep, that most talented and giving of actors, her elocution in this irritated me immensely.  I know she gets a hard time for her accents and most of the time I think that's unfair - she is giving, after all, and not self-indulgent - however, when the accent is such a distraction it defeats the purpose.

3975684,2,B002RSDW80,"The plot of this movie can be summed up as follows: Julia Child is bored with her life, so she decides to learn French cuisine.  Julie Powell is bored with her life, so she decides to make all of Julia Child's famous recipes and then blog about it.  We are bored with our lives, and so we decide to watch this movie, which, if we are VERY bored, we will switch off after fifteen minutes.

Why is this movie so boring? Well, for one thing, it was directed and written by Nora Ephron, who simply cannot write anything interesting. For example, it would have been fascinating to follow Julia Child a little more closely as a real person. Instead we got Meryl Streep's relentlessly fruity Julia Child impersonation (peppered with some vague references to the McCarthy era, which Ephron thought would spice things up, but didn't). The reason Julie Powell was so boring is that she is, well, boring.  What could be less interesting that the quintessential chick flick heroine? She's awkward, incompetent (hey, I could poach an egg when I was nine), has dull, catty friends, and has an inferiority complex so thick you could make fillets out of it.

The real question is: why do people like this boring stuff? Well, apparently we do so little with our lives that we can completely identify with a person who writes an inconsequential blog about a trivial topic (food, food, more food, and then feeling fat). Lacking purpose, we can sympthasize with purposelessness.

But maybe it's something more than that.  The two things that Julia and Julie share is that they both are products of a recession.  After WWII, there was a concerted effort to remove women from the workplace to make room for returning soldiers.  During the 40s, women had been managing whole industries, and doing it very nicely, when BANG! the 1950s arrived. Women were tossed out of their jobs and turned into ""home-makers."" Well, being stuck at home after having run a factory is boring.  Julia Child attempted to make the oldest profession (the real oldest profession) more tolerable by introducing a challenge: How time-consuming can I make cooking dinner? It was Julia's small, but significant contribution to the castration of post WWII women.

We have a similar problem now.  The short-lived gains achieved by women during the 70s have been made largely irrelevant by right-wing religious politics (women should be barefoot, pregnant and in the kitchen...with a microwave) and yet another recession. The only difference is that now, in spite of Martha Stewart's heroic efforts, the domestic arts are a thing of the past, so the only thing left to do with all that extra time is to blog.

And get fat.

3975685,5,B002RSDW80,"I remember being a kid and watching reruns of Julia Child's TV series with my grandmother. She, of course, had her book and would often cook from it. She used it constantly. I have some great memories of her in the kitchen and I always attached those memories to Julia Child.

I do wish I still had my grandmother's copy of Mastering the Art of French Cooking but, alas, it seems to have gotten lost over the years. I've recently purchased the books, vol. 1 and 2 as well as Julia's DVD collection so I get to watch her show all over again. It's all very nostalgic for me and it was a big part of growing up...realizing my love of food and the culinary arts and having Julia's teachings to help me. She definitely was the master. No one can touch her.

I was VERY excited when I'd heard they were making this movie based on her life. I'd somehow missed the book coming out but I grabbed it right away. I have to say that this may be my favorite movie. I saw it in theatres and since it came out on DVD, I've watched it around 30 to 40 times. I admit that I may be slightly obsessed.

It's the type of feel good movie that you can watch over and over if you need a pick me up. It's inspiring, it's amusing, it's interesting and it has some of the MOST lovable characters ever. I genuinely wanted to know these people. At times it feels like we're spying into their lives...overhearing a conversation or laughing at an inside joke. It's a story (well, 2 stories) that anyone can relate to. Two people, bored with their lives, take on challenges in a quest to better themselves and make their mark in the world. To be known and to have a purpose...and one of them becomes one of the greatest chefs of all time who wrote one of the most important and essential books in the culinary world. And it started simply because she had nothing better to do. It's inspiring because it shows you that you CAN set goals for yourself and really accomplish them.

It depicts Julia and Paul Child as very sweet, caring, upbeat characters with amazing senses of humor and a real lust for life. And I have no doubt that they really were just that. The love they had for each other is also definitely to be envied. We also get a peak into various other parts of their lives. Paul's government work as well as Julia's struggle to learn French, get her book published and to be accepted in what was very much a male dominated field at the time. Julie...was the opposite of Julia in a lot of ways. She was very negative. She was pessimistic and whiny, she was self involved and seemed to live in her own little world. However! She was still fun to watch and she provided a nice balance to the film...we get to watch her realize her mistakes, grow from them and learn to appreciate her husband and her life more than she did at the beginning. I realize the character of Julie in the film, from what I hear, is quite a bit different from the real Julie but...that's a different review.

The acting is superb! From everyone. Everyone in the movie had such amazing chemistry together. It was perfect casting. Amy Adams is fantastic at portraying Julie, Stanley Tucci was the perfect choice for Paul Child, Chris Messina was great as Julie's sweet, loving and always supportive and helpful husband Eric. Jane Lynch gave such an amusing, fun performance as Julia's sister Dorothy. I believe the time she and Meryl were on screen together was my favorite part of the movie, they had excellent chemistry. Also Linda Emond brought such a charm and likable spunkiness to Simone Beck. Last but not least...Meryl Streep deserved the Oscar for Julia. I believe she was robbed. Her mannerisms, her voice, her sense of humor and her overall lovable personality...she became Julia Child. One of the best performances by acting's best actress. You don't get any better than Meryl Streep.

The sets and the scenery are just beautiful. They did an amazing job filming the movie and capturing what her life was like in Paris. The film has a very whimsical feel to it...the charming decor, the bright bold colors of the food...the food, of course, makes the movie and there is a TON of it! I dare anyone to watch this and NOT be hungry after.

I couldn't imagine giving it anything but 5 stars because it deserves nothing less. It's a fantastic movie based on the life of a fantastic and memorable woman who's culinary teachings and food are treasured by so many people from so many places.

I love how they edit it, to go from Julia Child in Paris 40-50 years ago, to Julie in Queens, NY. The ending was awesome, and not much happened, I just personally believe it was amazing. BUY THIS MOVIE!!!!!! Its worth it, trust me!",1310601600,,796,4.243421052631579
3975687,5,B002RSDW80,"We found this show to be very entertaining, informative, and inspiring.
Meryl Streep's performance of Julia is absolutely magical

The movie is well woven together, presenting two seperate stories at the same time.

Here is the true story of Julia Child with her husband Paul (Stanley Tucci),
and their life in Paris in the 1950's.
The story focuses on the struggles and events
that brought Julia's famous cookbook into existence.

Paralleled with the true story of a struggling writer, Julie Powell (Amy Adams)
who pledges herself to prepare the entire 524 recipes of Julia Child's cookbook
""Mastering the art of Freach cooking"", with-in one year.

Some trivia, and moments of the movie that brings a smile.
1. A wonderful comment made by Julia while taking a class for professionnel cooks
at the Le Cordon Blew, ""My teacher moves so quickly I'm sometimes lost.
But I'm way ahead of the others in the class, all of them men,
and all of them very unfriendly untill they discovered I was fearless.
Something I realized about the same time they did.

2. Julia was committed to being sure her cookbook would make
French cooking accessible to Americans who do not have cooks.
Julia's opinion about a dish having to look and taste perfect.
""Perfection? - even if it isn't, never apopogize, no excuses,
no explanations, after all no one knows what you intended it to be"".

3. Boeuf Bourguignon was the first dish that Judith Jones the editor
of ""Mastering the art of Freach cooking"" perpared.
That was the convincing moment to publish the book.

4. The beautiful love song the movie ends with is ""Time after time"" by Margaret Whitting.
It can be found on a Capitol/EMI 2009 collection of her music here on Amazon.

5. Some KEY points of cooking from the show are -
If you don't dry meat it won't brown properly, and mushroons won't brown
if they aren't dried and have room left open around them in the pan.

6. Paul is quoted as saying ""Your book is a work of genius,
your book is going to change the world.
And indeed it has!
""Mastering the art of French cooking"" is in it's 49th printing.

This is an engaging movie, excellently directed, and preformed.

It shows how Julia became who she was and how she wrote her famous book while julie blogs and makes every dish from that book in a certain time alotted. It's clever and funny and very interesting.

3975692,3,B002RSDW80,"Julie & Julia starts out on a positive note by being somewhat original and creative before inevitably falling apart, so now I believe the movie is overrated.

The movie consists of two storylines constantly jumping back and forth.  One story is that of Julia Child herself from over 60 years ago in France slowly but surely becoming a cooking sensation by starting off with (surprisingly) questionable cooking skills and gradually improving into the celebrity we remember her for today.  I was actually surprised she started off on such a sluggish note as far as her cooking skills are concerned.  I always believed -along with many other folks- she was born to be such a great cook, but apparently not.

The other storyline (arguably the better one) is about Amy Adams character pretty much following in the legendary footsteps of Julia Child, so she spends a considerable amount of time cooking in her tight apartment kitchen being creative with a variety of different recipes and pretty much beating her brains out trying to make every dish exactly right.

Unfortunately the plot simply does NOT ever really pick up in a way that leaves me satisfied.  It moves along at a snails pace, and as you sit there hoping for that one special golden scene to save it, it never happens.  It just plods along, sometimes mildly funny, other times completely missing the mark.  By the time we reach the book publishing segment, the boredom becomes overwhelmingly intolerable.

I really think Julie & Julia should have been shortened by a good 45 minutes because the way it is, well, you probably have to be a huge Julia Child or Meryl Streep fan to really be able to tolerate all the eventual boredom you'll have to sit through.  I give it 3 stars out of 5 without any regret.  A better storyline should have been a requirement before putting it in theaters.",1299628800,,1848,4.758620689655173
3975693,4,B002RSDW80,"I have to say, I am probably biased in regards to this movie because its about food, and there are surprisingly few films within the genre of foodie movies.  And I love food.

Julie Powell has set herself a mission since her life doesn't seem to be going anywhere.  She is going to cook through Julia Child's The Art of French Cooking in a year, and blog about it.  Not such a big task some might think?  Well, over 500 recipes in 365 days is kind of a big deal, especially when some include boning a duck.  While she is navigating through this humongous task (and having it affect her life and marriage) we are given glimpses of Julia Child's life in Paris and how she started cooking and writing cookbooks.

Meryl Streep-Julia Child
Amy Adams-Julie Powell
Stanley Tucci-Paul Child
Chris Messina-Eric Powell
Linda Emond-Simone Beck
Helen Carey-Louisette Bertholle
Jane Lynch-Dorothy McWilliams

For casting I think they did a great job.  Meryl Streep was amazing as Julia Child and while I have not really watched too much of The French Chef show on PBS I could definitely see the similarities.  She and Stanley Tucci had great chemistry as well and it was a pleasure to watch them interact together and their love felt genuine.  Amy Adams I'm not as big a fan of in any movie, but I think she did ok here.  In my opinion Julie was a bit of a brat but I suppose no one can be perfect.  I did like her husband played by Chris Messina, but have to say that the way he eats was a little unappetizing.  Most surprising to me was when my fiance pointed out Julia's sister and shouted Glee!  Sure enough once pointed out I was able to recognize Jane Lynch and had a little giggle.

There weren't any special effects really in this movie but it was filmed rather well.  The times felt authentic and the shots of the food just wonderful.  I could feel my mouth watering as all these people got to eat fabulous dinners and I didn't even get a taste.  I love to cook myself though and perhaps this will hurry me along to buying a copy of The Art of French Cooking to give a try (except the aspics, eek).  The movie did get slow in a few parts and just like Julie's husband, I got tired of watching some of her meltdowns and wished it would have focused more on some of her successful creations from Julia's book.

As a warning, this movie does contain some adult language and themes and while I found the uses hilarious, others may not.

It is a very foodie movie and while I wish some techniques had been highlighted, or recipes shared, I can't really complain too much because it was about food and it really was interesting to see the history behind both Julia and Julie (who's book Julie and Julia is actually in my pile of books to read soon).  It is definitely a movie I would watch again.

Review by M. Reynard 2011",1299369600,,2813,4.386100386100386
3975694,3,B002RSDW80,"Julie & Julia is about Julie Powell who decides she'll spend a year cooking recipes in Julia Child's cookbook and blogging about it.  The movie skips between Julie's life and Julia life.  The story tries to run a parallel between  Julia (Meryl Streep) and Julie (Amy Adams).
I applaud Meryl Streep's performance.  Her portrayal was excellent.  Amy Adams didn't act badly, her character was just blah...I wished the Julie sequences would end and the Julia sequences would start.  Streep was THAT good.
I wished this movie was strictly about the life of Julia.  Instead - here's two women, they have the same dreams, they have turmoil in their lives, they both meet their goals.  But not really...comparing the life of Julia to Julie was futile.  Julie followed recipes and reported in her blog.  I'm sure it was therapeutic.  But the stretch to make their lives parallel failed.
There were scenes that lacked detail.  Julie tells everyone she has to ""debone a duck.""  The actual deboning scene moves quickly.  I wanted to see more, like scenes of her practicing and screwing them up instead of a short scene where she performs flawlessly.  At the end Julie gets a call saying ""Julia hates you.""  The next scene shows them visiting the Julia exhibit with Julie happily taking pictures and bringing her butter.  It's hard to believe that if you find your mentor hates you, it might take time to get back to that happy place.  This scene in the movie wasn't given the time needed.
Julie & Julia was on the long side, but the Julia half of the movie flew by.  I am hoping someone will now write a movie about Julia's life...I just hope that this movie gets written before Meryl Streep is too old to act in it.",1298505600,,1704,4.638795986622074
3975695,5,B002RSDW80,"One of my favorite past times is watching movies, and right now this is my absolute favorite!  Meryl Streep is at her finest and that she didn't win the academy award as best actress completely baffles me - her performance was superb!",1298160000,,234,4.571428571428571
3975696,2,B002RSDW80,"Started well, Streep as Child is fabulous, but the plot stalls over the last half as the movie loses its verve.",1297209600,,111,4.333333333333333

3975700,3,B002RSDW80,"Being a professional chef for some number of years I had looked forward to this film with great anticipation and trepidation. The movie proved me right. The scenes with Meryl positively shined, the interruptions with ""Julie"" however proved to be an annoying, self-serving, why-is-my-life-so-hard and why-poor-me, all too often interlude. To use the tragedy of 9.11 as a pillar of Julie's angst to get the audience to commiserate with her seems cheap in its reach and diminishing to those that suffered through that tragic heartache. To be sure, if the facts are straight and she did deal with the 9.11 unfortunates, I applaud her for that but who would exploit that chapter of their life for personal gratification? Are the (female)producers and directors of today's films just paying lip service to the great old broads (icons) that came before them or are they simply giving them a left-handed salute? For example ""A League of Their Own"" was touching and gentle yet got the point across in a strong, no nonsense way without self pity or moaning. Julie, good for you, you made your 15 minutes but Nora, shouldn't this movie have been more accurately been titled ""Julia & Julie""? That's the way I'm logging it into my library. There will never be a Julie Powell before Julia Child. Period.",1294876800,,1289,4.890410958904109

3975706,2,B002RSDW80,"If only they had edited out a minute of dialog, this tale of two women from different eras pursuing the same dream would rate 4 or 5 stars.  But the movie's writers decided to pepper the script with swipes at conservatives, thus ruining what would have been a heartwarming story.  For example, when Julie's day job supervisor reproaches her for calling in sick, he admonishes ""If I were a Republican, you would be fired"".  And Julia's husband constantly complains about how Senator McCarthy interferes in his work.  Enjoy the story, but filter out the propaganda.",1291507200,7,563,4.894736842105263

3975708,5,B002RSDW80,I had to drag my husband to this movie ... but he reluctently admitted that he enjoyed it.  We both agreed that by the end of the movie you honestly believed that you were watching Julie Child. Meryl Streep did an incredible acting job.  I could watch this over and over again.  If you haven't seen this ... don't hesitate!  It actually inspired me to get out on old copy of Mastering the Art of French Cooking and try the Beef Bourguignon recipe (it turned out great)!,1290211200,,469,4.35632183908046
3975709,5,B002RSDW80,"This is one of my favorite movies of all time. It offers a vivid picture of how the world has changed in the last 50 to 60 years. Julia is a young, mature, woman searching for herself, and finding it in the thing she loves most. During her search, she is supported by her wonderful husband, whom she never forgets to appreciate. Their love story is so beautiful and heart warming. They were truly an amazing couple. And she is truly the Mentor of all time for those who love to cook.

Julie, on the other hand, is a young, immature, self absorbed nit-wit, who goes looking for herself in Julia's shadow and convinces herself she is a great person by the end of the movie. There is absolutely no comparison between the two, except in Julie's demented mind. She makes you nervous, irritated, and wishing you could spank her and put her in a corner. Her husband is long suffering, and decent, and you wonder why he was ever attracted to her in the first place.

If you can suffer through the ""generation of today"" parts of the movie, it is worth watching over and over again, just for the Julia and Paul half of it. It makes you long for the days of intelligence, virtue, and a world where you could safely go searching for yourself, and truly succeed in your dreams.",1290124800,,1264,4.397435897435898
3975710,4,B002RSDW80,"I enjoyed this film very much, for Meryl Streep as Julia Child and the insight into the real Julia - her life in France, her marraige, her co-authors and the years of work that went into her first book; well worth watching and learning.
On the other hand, while the young 'Julie' (Amy Adams) is funny at times, she is mostly annoying, whiny, and her segments were not as good as those of Julia.

Meryl shines!  As Julia, she's well worth watching, especially if you love Julia Child and anything French.

So, break out the good FRENCH wine, velvet pillows, get comfy and savor.

It also goes back in time and shows what was going on in Child's life and how the book came about. But the movie is so much more than a cook-a-thon and bio-pic. It also deals with how people can transform their lives by following their passion, even when everyone else says you can't do it. The film also shows the love that people can have for one another and how eating is so much more than just satisfying hunger; it brings people together.

The movie is funny, has dramatic moments, and the cast is outstanding! I think Meryl Streep did Julia Child better than Julia herself, LOL.

And the set and wardrobe designs for the Julia Child segments are beautiful.

The JULIE & JULIA BLU-RAY features these extras:

=====  SPECIAL FEATURES  ======

* 27:35-minute featurette -- ""Creating Julie & Julia""
Director Nora Ephron, the real Julie Powell, Meryl Streep (Julia), Amy Adams (Powell), Chris Messina (Powell's husband in the film), Stanley Tucci (Paul Child), Jane Lynch (Julia's sister in the film), costume designer Ann Roth, Child's nephew Alex Prud'Homme, and others discuss making the movie and the books.

* 47:29-minute featurette -- ""Friends and Family Remember Julia Child""
Judith Jones the editor who worked with Julia Child's first book, co-author Simone Beck (Simca), nephew Alex Prud'Homme, and others discuss what it was like working with Julia Child and how it was growing up with such a famous aunt.

* 22:21-minute featurette -- ""Julia's Kitchen""
Smithsonian curators discuss meeting with Child and how they managed to take her kitchen and place it at the Smithsonian. Very insightful and you get a tour of the kitchen and all the stuff in there.

* 5 Cooking Lessons *
Five cooking lessons -- two with Julia Child ""Poaching Eggs"" and ""Making Hollandaise Sauce""-- the other three recipes feature other chefs: ""Scrambled Eggs,"" ""Braised Beef Short Ribs,"" and ""Butter Poached Maine Lobster."" I haven't done any of the recipes but they look good.

Anyway, there's something really delightful in JULIE & JULIA and even though I've seen it many times now, the first being on cable, I never get tired of watching it.",1286064000,2,2806,5.576470588235294

3975718,2,B002RSDW80,"More mannered Meryl, quite acceptable.  But did they do some CGI to make her look taller?  I usually like Amy Adams, but feel she was wasted in this movie. Stanley Tucci is incomparable, as usual.
I couldn't figure the link between the Julia of the 1950s and the present day cook. Well I could really, but I didn't believe in it.  I think it would have been more interesting as a straight biopic.  At least the movie had the honesty to state that Julia Childs herself would have nothing to do with it. Well done!",1284940800,2,512,4.3578947368421055

3975720,4,B002RSDW80,"Very enjoyable.  Here are two comments:
- Scriptwriter Ephron often has characters annoyingly repeat phrases, e.g., ""I will; I will."" ""OK; OK"", etc., etc.
- Streep's imitation is excellent, but I wonder if Child used that affected high-pitch 100% of the time?  Even in bed?",1284681600,,273,5.044444444444444
3975721,4,B002RSDW80,I saw this a few months back.  Better than expected.  It's a three star normally but the all star studded cast pushed it up to four.  The approach is a two pronged story showing Julia Childs before she was famous and all the resistances she met in her life (Stanley Tucci does an amazing job of playing her supportive husband) and then jumping to modern day Julie who has resistances of her own.  Notice that Jany Lynch (i.e. Sue Sylvester from GLEE) is the sister of Julia Childs.  Meryl Streep was nominated for best actress for the AA and GG.  She won the GG nomination for best actress in a musical or comedy.  WHEN WATCHED: June; MY GRADE: B to B plus.,1284422400,,657,4.336065573770492

3975723,3,B002RSDW80,"I don't normally enjoy ""chick flicks"" but was able to sit through this one and even enjoy the ""Julia"" half of it.  Meryl Streep is an incredible actress and made ""Julia"" come to life.  The actress portraying ""Julie"" did a fine job of portraying her, but the character is just too whiny and self-centered to enjoy.  The whole premise of ""finding one's self"" by cooking her way through a cookbook is absurd and hard to watch.  I don't doubt that Julia was disgusted by Julie's blogging this into a ""life changing"" escapade.

Both husbands in the movie tend to be long suffering and put up with a lot of whining and indecision from their wives.  Julia's husband was wealthy and could afford to indulge his wife's expensive tastes but Julie's husband cannot.  Julia had the time, money and forceful personality to indulge her fantasies and turn them into reality, but Julie wallows in her lack of disadvantages.  Somehow modern sensibilities transform Julie's mediocrity into fame.

All in all, this is a watchable movie thanks to Meryl and Amy and Julia but difficult in many scenes involving Julie.  Not a great film but not terrible, either.",1284249600,3,1140,4.8

I guess the film maker thought we wouldn't be interested in Julia Child unless her story was somehow linked to the kind of tv drivel that passes as entertainment today. It was just about worth sitting through all this for the Julia Child scenes. Child (Streep) and husband are as spectacularly good as the other two are spectacularly bad. Hopefully there will be a future dvd edition that will allow one-touch navigation through the movie, deleting everything involving the nobodies.",1284163200,6,852,5.226277372262774
3975725,5,B002RSDW80,"Honestly, Julie & Julia is one of those movies where  you better have something to eat stashed next to you.  I swear I salivated through the entire film, enjoying every scene that played through with elegant pictures of delicious meals that makes one want to shoot out and pick up the cookbooks that Julia Child wrote in her prolific career. (Yes, I will admit that I couldn't resist shooting over to Amazon.  Currently, I have one in the mail.)

Julie & Julia is an entrancing and lovely story divided between the lives of two equally charming women, our modern-day Julie and the ever charming aficionado of the kitchen, Julia.  Meryl Streep is at her stunning best, pulling off the perfect performance of Julia Child.  Her portrayal was so precise, I had to find a photo and video on Google to compare the two women.

A person doesn't have to be a fan of Julia Child to enjoy this movie.  Honestly, I wasn't, at first.  My thoughts changed entirely as I continued to watch this movie.  Julie & Julia was an entrancing walk into the life of a woman that we all had seen at one time or another on television, but knew little of her life or the passion that she had with her husband or her chosen career.  Julie (Amy Adams), who becomes so involved in her 365 day blog of cooking each meal in Julia's Mastering the Art of French Cooking, gradually finds joy in the momentous task she has taken on. As a viewer, I found that Julie grew from a self-conscious wreck into a confident and self-assured young woman, all due to the wise guidance of our towering chef.

To say I loved this movie would be an understatement, but I would recommend having a full meal before you sit down to watch it.",1283904000,,1688,4.444805194805195

3975727,5,B002RSDW80,"I'm gonna make a confession right up front--I LOVE anything that Meryl Streep is in because she is one of the most underrated actresses in cinematic history. Her genius is an uncanny ability to dive so completely into a character that you can't help but see the person she's playing rather than the actress.  That's the sign of an incredibly talented person and Streep hits on all cylinders in JULIE & JULIA like she did in THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA.

For those of us who didn't know how Julia Child became such a world-renowned household name, this film gives you the back story about how her husband moving from city to city as a disgruntled government employee gave her time to pursue things that interested her.  While she tried her hand at a variety of subjects while living in Paris, France, she eventually came to the realization that cooking was her real passion and began pursuing it.  From high-level training in a prestigious cooking school to being approached by a couple of flaky potential cookbook authors to collaborate on an English cookbook with French recipes, Julia constantly went after the dream--bringing French cooking to Americans who didn't have servants to cook for them.  Thus was borne what would become one of the most significant culinary figures of our time whose impact is still felt today.

JULIE & JULIA simultaneously runs the story of a 9/11 government group employee named Julie who got inspired to do something with her life in 2002 when she set her sights on cooking her way through all of Julia Child's 500+ recipes in the span of one year--and blogging about it!  As a writer, she felt compelled to share everything with her readers (""whoever you are"") about her cooking ups and downs during this yearlong journey.  I could so relate to this Julie character since I blog for a living and so many of the things that were discussed in this movie about having a blog are absolutely true.  Julie got her big break when The New York Times did a big feature story on her blog and that's when the publicists, book publishers, television shows, and more all began contacting her with opportunities that went on to become a book and then this magnificent film.

My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed this movie (and we knew we would) for our special date night and highly recommend it to bloggers, foodies, and those of you who are curious about the rise of a real legend in the history of cooking named Julia Child.  WATCH THIS MOVIE!",1283558400,,2458,4.679814385150812
3975728,3,B002RSDW80,"Meryl Streep did very well in her role as Julia Child. She was a dead ringer, for sure. If only this movie could've been made as a biopic for Julia Child only. I would've enjoyed that very much, and it would've been a far more interesting movie.

Quite frankly, I could've done without seeing the antics of the Julie Powell, whiny chica who was attempting to ride Ms. Childs's coattails. At first, when watching the movie, I couldn't understand why Julia Child disregarded her. Then I finally read Julie's book and viewed her blog, so now I completely understood why Julia Child blew off Julie and her insipid blog and cooking ""stunt.""  Anyone who read Julia Childs's book knows that Julia's life was far more interesting. She was no victim of circumstances. She had gumption, vision, she took the bull by the horns and when she was disappointed in something or when things didn't go her way, she didn't go falling on the floor in a meltdown like Julie did. I wanted to smack the Julie character when I saw that!

Amy Adams did the best she could with the material she was given. I don't fault her for having to play the emotionally immature Julie Powell. The screenwriter does deserve some credit for actually making that 'sow's ear' into a reasonable fascimile of a silk purse. Those who plowed through Powell's whiny tome will know exactly of what I speak.

I thought Stanley Tucci did an excellent job portraying Paul Child, Julia's husband. As for those complaining about the politics in the movie and the way it was portrayed, I think that is an unfair thing. It's good to see a movie that does deal with the way McCarthyism impacted the lives of regular people, not just celebrities.

Still, despite its flaws, I think the movie is worth watching, as long as you don't expect too much.",1283385600,2,1792,4.622641509433962
3975729,3,B002RSDW80,"There really isn't much to add in the 350th Amazon review of ""Julie & Julia,"" so I'll limit myself to one observation.

Not long after ""Julie & Julia"" was released, another film hit a few screens with, alas, no appreciable effect.  It was ""Me and Orson Welles.""  In both films a much larger than life character was brilliantly portrayed by a character actor.  In both films, half the screentime was devoted to a younger nonentity.  Has the appreciation of the movie-going public held by Hollywood's movers and shakers fallen so low that they believe that big characters and big acting can only be approached through the intermediation of on-screen nobodies?

Get the DVD.  Enjoy Streep and Tucci.  Sleep through the agita and tsouris of Whats'ername playing Julie.  Leave the TV set and get yourself a snack, preferably something from Julia Child's book, whenever that abominable, knuckle-dragging, talks-with-his-mouth-full, clod married to Julie befouls the screen.

Five stars for the Julia part of the film.  Zero stars for the Julie part.  Two-and-one-half stars overall; call it three.

3975730,2,B002RSDW80,"This movie is a conflation of two books, Powell's ""Julie and Julia: My Year of Cooking Dangerously"" and Child's ""My Life in France"".  While the premise of the movie is that Julia shares synchronicity with Julie, the fact that both occupied apartments, made love and enjoyed cooking does not seem to square with the fact that Julia's apartment was in Paris while Julie's was in Queens, Julia wore a robe while Julie wears t-shirts and that Julia was trained at the Cordon Bleu Academy while Julie has no training in the culinary arts.

Toward the end of the movie we find out that Julia actually distastes Julie's quest for fame through her blog of Julia's cookbook.  Hmmm, they aren't so synchronous after all!  No surprise, these are two very different people with very different motivations, living in different eras. The only thing that strikes a chord is the search for meaning by both Julia & Julie, other than that the movie is a complete waste of time.  I especially disliked the prosaic interjection of Hollywood stereotypes of Julia drinking martinis, hosting diplomatic parties, always eating in French restaurants and chain-smoking while eating--but never having time to write her book!  Also, when the plotline gets thin for Julie, the director resorts to rock music, a sex scene or Saturday Night Live clip to spice things up.  [Where, for instance, is the actual footage of Julia on television?]  Give me a break!!  The producers/director seem to want us to be sold on our degraded modern lifestyle to make it seem that Julia was not so different from us, rather than belonging to the 40's and 50's.  A terrible mish-mosh of cultural stereotypes, politically correct speech (""anti-Communists are all bad...""), misplaced values and landscapes.",1282694400,2,1756,5.0034364261168385

Julie and Eric's relationship seemed petty, both in its love without any apparent foundation (and no reason ever given for their move to an apartment that Julie hates from the start), and their petty fights over very little.

3975735,5,B002RSDW80,"Julie & Julia is another triumph for the remarkable Meryl Streep and the equally remarkable Stanley Tucci. Amy Adams rises to the occasion as Julie Powell, the little blogger who could.

In case you don't know the story, Julie Powell was a frustrated writer married to a magazine editor and enslaved to a government job that was sucking the life out of her. She hears about a friend who is blogging and vows that she could do that too, but she doesn't know what she could blog about. The only thing she really loves to do is cook.

Why not a cooking blog? She decides to cook and blog her way through Julia Child's amazing Mastering The Art of French Cooking. Her husband, played by Chris Messina, is suitably supporting. In fact, he puts up with more than a bit of her whining until she has her wake-up moment, realizes what a bitch she's been, and cleans up her act.

Along the way we're treated to Meryl Streep as Julia Child, fifty years ago embarking on her own voyage of discovery in post-war France with her husband Paul, played by one of my favorite actors Stanley Tucci. Why Mr. Tucci hasn't won an Oscar yet is a mystery to me. I've loved him from the time I saw him as Muerte in Undercover Blues with Mr. Dazzling Smile aka Dennis Quaid.

We switch back and forth between Julia, trying to find herself in the cooking world dominated by men to Julie, trying to find herself period. Despite certain negatives, for instance, Julie simply isn't on equal standing when it comes to Julia Child's vibrant personality. Yes, she's the heroine of her side of the tale, but she's not particularly likeable in many scenes. One wonders why she's friends with such disparate characters who she envies, despite their shallowness, However, perhaps the real Julie, in real life, was insecure and lost so the movie is a faithful rendering of her at that time in her life. Thankfully, her character grew in the movie. One can hope in real life also.

All in all, the movie is an utter delight from its opening in a Paris that only exists in memory to its closing shot of Julia Child's kitchen, now in the Smithsonian Museum. In between, we get to see the profound love between Julia and Paul Child. We hope that Julie and her husband's relationship will be equally rich and enduring.

Let's not forget the food. Oh, my! After watching the DVD a couple of times I had to break out my old copy of Julia's cookbook and roast a big fat hen.

3975741,1,B002RSDW80,"I wanted to see if the movie treatment of the book (which I thought was just so-so) was any good.  Sad to say: it isn't. There are a lot of films that don't do justice to the books they're based upon, which is true in this case.  But the movie also introduces some disturbing elements that weren't even part of the book.

Stanley Tucci, as Julia's husband Paul, was, as always, enjoyable to watch. Amy Adams was good at playing a whiny pain. Meryl Streep, though, really annoyed me.  She was an Ugly American, loud and obnoxious, offending the ""refined French sensibilities."" Which is a lot of merde du taureau, if you ask me.

But the movie went from being silly and dumb to being outright offensive with the subplot involving Joe McCarthy's persecution of Paul Child. (That was even worse merde du taureau.) First of all, that wasn't in the book.  I haven't read Julia Child's memoir about France, so maybe the screenwriters lifted it from that, I don't know. From what I understand, Paul was questioned briefly but the ""investigation"" didn't harm him or his career.  Second, Joe McCarthy was an alcoholic, and the very strong pro-Soviet element in our government had a vested interest in making him look like a nut, but even a broken clock is right twice a day. He wasn't busting little old Russian ladies having tea parties with their samovars--he was going after people who were plotting to bring down the U.S. government. It's too bad more politicians weren't brave enough to support what he was trying to do.  Still, at the end of the day, his efforts did throw the fear of God into foreign agents who were trying to impose a Soviet system here. (And in the REAL Soviet Union, at that time, millions of people were executed or shipped off to gulags or ruined.)

Nora Ephron was involved in producing this film, and the fact is, EVERYTHING coming out of Hollywood that deals with the 1950's MUST DEMONIZE MCCARTHY. It's the law. So of course that agenda had to be pushed.

Too bad, because if they'd left that little drama out, the movie might have merited another half-star.",1278720000,16,2081,4.630434782608695

The film intersperses cutouts from the lives of each of the two -- the up and coming Child, who took cooking classes in France during the 1950s and became a better chef than the men in her class -- and Powell, a nobody in a New York insurance telephone center with aspirations of fame and glory as a chef. The interplay of scenes from each woman's life, including their respective marriages, personal lives and troubles, keeps the film humane and interesting. It allows you to involve yourself with the totality of each woman rather than watching a glossy soap opera of their interchange.

The cast is a good one. Meryl Streep, veteran of Silkwood and scores of other big name films, plays the famous Child in every scene. She did remind me of the woman I watched on PBS's The French Chef in the 1970s with all her personality and frolicsome behaviors. Amy Adams is sympathetic as Powell, the wannabe chef that finally arrives after publishing the outcome of her cooking on her blog. In this regard, the film is a traversal of routes to fame in the respective centuries -- with Child reaching hers through television and literature (a cookbook) and Powell staking her claim to fame through the new century medium, the blog.

The film is engaging although I can't say it's among the most memorable movies I've seen in recent months. It's surely a good one and worth your rental or purchase dollars, especially if you have a bored girlfriend of wife looking for something different, breezy and entertaining tonight on the small screen.

Julie yearns to be a writer and is despondent over the time she spent writing a novel that didn't get finished or find a publisher. She is a functionary in a government office and wants to do something with her life, make something of herself.

 She decides to teach herself how to cook really well and launches herself on preparing each of the 524 recipes in Julia Child's famous book on French cooking in exactly one year. At her husband's urging, she'll record the effort in a blog.

 Julia Child (Meryl Streep) and her husband Paul (Stanley Tucci) take up residence in Paris in 1946. Julia too is looking for a way to fulfill herself and she attends the world famous Cordon Bleu cooking school and embarks, with friends, on writing a book on French cooking for American wives who don't have cooks.

 The parallel stories work like magic: Julia as she indulges her love of cooking over the near decade it took to write her book - and Julie as she goes through the ups and downs of emulating Julia and dealing with being a ""nobody"".

 `The movie is perfectly cast, Meryl Streep is Julia Child, though you never forget that she is also Meryl Streep. Stanley Tucci is marvelous as the supportive husband. Amy Adams is a perkish Julie Powell and her performance is engaging as she works day by day through the formidable task she has set for herself. Chris Messina, unfortunately, is metrosexualized or something and his performance while good, is left behind by the others.

 The storytelling is what made movies great. You feel for the people you're presented with on the screen: Julia, Julie, Paul and even Eric. You laugh a lot, get teary eyed once in a while, feel their sadness.

 All in all, ""Julia and Julie"" is a marvelous piece of moviemaking which I thoroughly enjoyed.

3975754,4,B002RSDW80,"A young couple takes a cramped apartment in Queens. He's a writer for Archaeology Magazine; she's a frustrated writer also, muddling along in a government office answering questions for 9/11 survivors and feeling depressed and stressed from her job. Her method of unwinding is cooking, which is highly appreciated by her husband, who is supportive and a good listener.

Then one day she hits upon an epiphany of sorts; she will work her way through Julia Child's cookbook, all 524 recipes, and assign herself a 365-day deadline. So she will follow through with her plan, she starts a blog and begins to gain a following.

Paralleling this storyline is the actual story of Julia Child's (Meryl Streep) start as a reknowned chef, from her move to Paris with her government-official husband (Stanley Tucci, quietly wonderful) to her entering Le Cordon Bleu cooking school as a way to give her life meaning. No one but Streep could pull this off so well - she has Child down cold. Tucci plays her husband Paul with grace and style, a minor bureaucrat who indulges his rather over-the-top wife in every instance, while quietly worrying about his own government position.

The movie goes back and forth between storylines, with Julia coming off as the more level of the two chefs (Julie is played by Amy Adams, her husband by Chris Messina). Julia is not rattled by anything but steams ahead like an ocean liner; Julie, working against her self-imposed deadline, gets more frazzled and exhausted by the day, holding down her thankless job and rushing home to cook the next recipe.

In a year top-heavy with good performances, Streep shone in her role; but perhaps it was inevitable that she would lose Best Actress, simply because we expect her to be that good. And the movie was light fare, not quite Oscar material, but a romp anyway. All the other roles in this movie were also played faultlessly, and the story is true, which makes it nicer. It's a worthwhile 2 hours, and probably worth a second viewing in a few months.",1274832000,2,2019,4.793103448275862

So I stayed away from watching the movie for a long time despite the positive reviews. Well, being a fan of Meryl Streep, I finally decided to give it a try, and boy, am I glad! This is truly a wonderful tribute of sorts to the cooking icon that is Julia Child, who is flawlessly portrayed by Meryl Streep  - I can't believe how this veteran actress managed to master Child's way of speaking, as well as her mannerisms. It goes to show that Streep can make any role her own, as evidenced by her great and impressive body of work -&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Out-of-Africa-25th-Anniversary-Blu-ray-DVD-Combo/dp/B00371QQ5W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Out of Africa: 25th Anniversary (Blu-ray/DVD Combo)</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-French-Lieutenant-s-Woman/dp/B00005LOKU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The French Lieutenant's Woman</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sophie-s-Choice/dp/0784011710/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sophie's Choice</a>, and many more.

The story is actually split into two narratives - in the present day, there's the young Julie Powell, who languishes as a temp in a government agency despite having the potential to be a good writer. Julie is portrayed by the adorable Amy Adams, though her role here does escalate into whining and tantrums, and is downright annoying most of the time. As a means of proving that she is capable of finishing a project, she takes on the challenge of creating and maintaining a food blog which documents her exploits in the kitchen - creating each recipe written by Julia Child in the course of a year.

The other narrative centers on Julia Child herself back in the 50s - both Child (Streep) and her husband Paul(played to perfection by Stanley Tucci, lately seen in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Lovely-Bones/dp/B001QOGYAO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Lovely Bones</a>) are portrayed as a loving and fine food loving couple who have moved to Paris due to Paul's government posting. Julia finds herself at wits end trying to keep herself occupied whilst Paul works and tries her hand at a variety of pursuits - hat-making, bridge, and finally, cooking classes at Le Cordon Bleu. This serves as a catalyst that ignites Julia's passion for French cooking and the rest is of course history.

The two parallel narratives flow well - and the excellent casting makes this movie a joy to watch. Streep personifies Child to a hilt - her gastronomic delight in enjoying fine French cuisine, her affectionate and close bond with husband Paul (it helps that Tucci and Streep share credible on-screen sexual chemistry, though I would not have thought it to be so had I not watched this movie), her unspoken sorrow of not having a child with Paul, and her zeal in pursuing her passion for French cooking - these scenes with Streep make this a memorable viewing experience. Amy Adams seems sweet enough for the role of self-doubting (initially) Julie Powell, but her whining and self-centered ways when things don't quite go according to plan and the abominable way she treats her wonderfully supportive husband and best friend, make watching her quite a pain.

Personally, I was more riveted and entertained by the Child-centered storyline and only wish there could have been more of such scenes. The movie though does work well with this dual narrative format and the themes of strong-willed women chasing after their dreams through resilience as well as the support of loving spouses make this an entertaining and engaging movie which will appeal to both foodies and those who are fans of chick flicks.",1274313600,,3873,5.647766323024055
3975759,4,B002RSDW80,"As most of my friends could tell you, I am no cook.  But when I saw this movie I began to believe that if Julie Powell could cook all 524 of the recipes in Julia Childs' book ""Mastering The Art of French Cooking"", then maybe I could at least cook.

""Julie and Julia"" tells two stories.  First is the tale of Julia Childs moving from learning to cook French to publishing a best selling cookbook.  Meryl Streep is convincing in her task of playing the culinary legend Julia Child.  Stanley Tucci is brilliant in playing Julia's gentle and supporting husband, Paul.  The scenes of Julia's adventure in locations in  Paris, are realistic and beautiful.  Paul's patience as his wife struggles with critics and the snobbery of the French cooking school owner is the stuff of legend.

The second story relates how a frustrated government office worker releases her hidden writing and cooking talents in a effort to cook all of Child's recipes within 365 days and record her efforts in an Internet blog.  Amy Adams does an outstanding job of portraying Julie Powell and the challenge and emotionally charged effort.  We see the impressive dedication the project requires and Julie knows it.  When a friend says that acquaintances claim Julie is a bitch, Julie simply agrees.

Mostly it is the minute detail of cooking that attracted me.  As I watch Meryl learn to flip a quiche in a frying pan I was inspired.  When I witnesses Meryl and Amy actually debone a duck, I knew they were telling me that I could do this.  I am tempted to collect the ingredients and make some of the numerous sauces detailed in Child's book.  First, however, I have an Amazon friend, Aceto, who is indeed a noted chef.  I will ask his advice before I jump into the fray.  Aceto, is this possible for a klutz like me?

I highly recommend ""Julie and Julia"".  This is not only an entertaining movie, I is a great learning experience.",1274313600,3,1901,4.614925373134328
3975760,3,B002RSDW80,"Meryl Streep is excellent as Julia Child and should have had the entire movie to herself. The attempt to appeal to a younger generation, by adding in an immature blogger named Julie, dragged the film down. Living in NYC, I know all too many narcissistic twentysomethings like Julie, wannabe writers who blog all day about their silly lives and whine, whine, whine. The difference between the lives of Julia and Julie is the difference between a full-bodied French wine, aged to perfection, and a Trader Joe's ten dollar wine, organic, of course. Julia has depth and variety, a hard worker and survivor of the post WWII generation who has known difficult times, fought the sexism of French cooking schools and appreciates all the joy that life has to offer. In contrast, Julie is a child-like, shallow Generation Y blogger in love only with the sound of her own voice, a pampered princess who thinks living in the ""outer boroughs"" is akin to a tragedy (too bad she didn't live through WWII) and who can break down in tears over a dropped chicken. She's supposed to turn 30 during the film, but she sounds like she's 20. No wonder the real Julia Child hated her blog (filet mignon doesn't want to be compared to a McDonald's hamburger). Pity Streep has to share her screen time with this silly young thing.

If you like to eat, if you like to cook, if you like to watch two married couples who support each other and treat each other as equals, then this is a film you will enjoy.

3975763,4,B002RSDW80,"I loved this movie.

First of all, Meryl Streep. Need I say more? She totally nails the Julia Child voice and mannerisms. But she does it while maintaining Julia as an actual person, not some 2D caricature. Amy Adams, as Julie Powell, is no slouch, either. Streep and Stanley Tucci do an excellent job of re-creating the Childs' warm and wonderful love affair, and Chris Messina is admirable as Powell's long-suffering husband.

Though there is significantly less profanity in the movie than in the book it was based on, it's a pretty close match up other than that. And I loved the light touch of the film, which filed off a few of Powell's harder edges from the book. Though Childs' inability to have a baby was referenced, it wasn't belabored, and though the Powell marriage went through its up and downs (and ended, I believe, not too long ago), those troubles didn't overwhelm the real story - a woman's discovery of her voice and her confidence in the kitchen.

3975767,4,B002RSDW80,"This is a delightful, funny, heartwarming, and charming movie. I resisted it for quite a while. Saying to me, ""Hey, it's Meryl Streep and Amy Adams in a Nora Ephron fim about female empowerment, romance, and fulfillment in two different centuries!"" is not a way to get me into a theater. ""Hey, it's about a blogger!"" is also not a way to get me into a theater. After all, I'm a blogger myself, and I have to think that watching a movie about me working on my blog would be only slightly less boring that watching an experimental film about bread rising.

But this film is about Julia Child. And I love Julia Child. Or at least, I love her cookbook. I've had Mastering the Art of French Cooking as one of my basic cooking books for years. It's the go-to source for all of the basic techniques of food creation. In my opinion, you can just remove the word ""French"" from the title of the book. Almost everything in the book is the basics of how to cook good food. Julia teachs how to hold a knife. How to slice every kind of vegetable. How to prepare every type of meat. What the various types of basic sauces are, and how to make them.

I've absorbed so much of what Julia teaches in the book, that when I describe a recipe that I've created or tweaked on my own, I will frame it in terms of techniques from the book. ""Well, first, you start with a basic Julia Child White Sauce, the cream version that's in the Sauces chapter, and then...""

Julie and Julia is a story of two different people in two different centuries, linked together across time by a love of cooking and writing. The ""Julie"" of the story is Julie Powell (Amy Adams), a modern-day woman just turning thirty. She lives in a small Queens (New York City) apartment with her husband Eric (Chris Messina), and works at a grinding government cubicle job, answering phone calls from angry members of the public. She's foundering in life; her dreams of being a writer are slowly fading away, and she feels increasingly that only the strength of her loving husband keeps her going. She needs a change. She needs a project. And so, in late 2002, she decides that her project will consist of cooking every single recipe in Julia Child's seminal cookbook, Mastering the Art of French Cooking, over the period of exactly one year. And she will write a blog about the entire process, and how it changes her life.

The ""Julia"" in the story is, of course, Julia Child. The film begins in 1949 as Julia and her diplomat husband Paul (Stanley Tucci) arrive in France, to begin a four-year assignment there. While Paul is busy at his new job, Julia tries desperately to find something to keep her busy. She begins taking French lessons. She tries her hand at learning how to make hats. She learns how to get around Paris, and enjoys shopping and the markets. Every night, she and Paul eat a fabulous French dinner at a different restaurant. One night, Paul tells her to do whatever it is that she likes most. ""I like to eat!"" she says. And right then and there, she decides to enter culinary school and become a chef.

Although Julie and Julia never meet, their stories parallel each other. The film works by cutting back and forth every ten minutes or so between the two characters and the two different time periods. Julia Child becomes a chef, and then, with the help of two other female French chefs, decides to write the ultimate English language book of how to cook in the French style. We watch her struggles and triumphs over the decade it takes to bring the book to life and finally see it published to glowing reviews. We pass through a variety of different diplomatic posts for the Childs, until the McCarthy era puts an end to their style of open and casual diplomacy.

Back in 2002, we watch Julie Powell as she works her way through Julia's book, now in its 47th printing. Her daily blog postings become more and more famous. The New York Times writes an article about her efforts. And Judith Jones - the still-living publisher who approved Julia Child's book nearly fifty years ago - schedules a visit to see how she's doing.

The whole movie is done in a bright, cheery, almost whimsical style that suits the story matter perfectly. Meryl Streep, always wonderful, is awesome as Julia Child. Although the modern parts of the movie are fine and dandy for what they are, it's the period pieces set in France of the 1950's that are the heart of this film. I also have to give a special shout-out to Jane Lynch (currently famous as evil cheerleader coach Sue Sylvester on Glee), who plays Julia's sister Dorothy to perfection.

It's a happy movie, and I won't keep you in suspense: It has a happy ending. Julie Powell ends up turning her blog into a book, which becomes this movie. And Julia Child does get her french cooking book published, which becomes a best-seller, leading to her becoming a TV star on the long-running cooking show The French Chef.",1272326400,2,4914,4.513483146067416

It looked like such a fun movie that I just grabbed it.  Honestly, I'm really picky about movies, and I feel that there can be some difference in opinion on what is ok for someone to watch. So, if you don't agree with me, sorry, this is just my opinion, and I'm not saying you are wrong if you think differently than me.

Now, I know that sounds like I don't like Julie and Julia.  I  did enjoy it, and thought it was very cute, but I had a few problems with some of the things I saw/heard.
I loved that both gals were married, stayed married and never had affairs and were happy!! For Hollywood to actually make a movie like that surprised me a bit.  definitely a good thing.  I like how `real' the movie seemed by showing some of the rough parts of marriage and how they worked through it.  I think movies have a tendency to say marriage is either terrible or wonderful, but rarely does it show the in-between which is where most marriages are.

My problems with the movie: Language and partial nudity.  I know that a lot of people probably didn't/don't have a problem with the amount that is in this movie, but for me it was too much.  I know that this is a `real' story, so if that's the way they talked, then some people would say it  'should' be in the movie. I feel that watching people making out, half-dressed is inappropriate for people to see.  Really the language and make out scenes were just unnessisary and didn't add to the quality of the movie.

PluggedIn is an online review site that tells you exactly what words are in movies and how many times it was spoken, and can be a great source before you watch a movie.  ( I had read it before I watched this, but then it was so long before I rented it that I forgot  )

3975783,5,B002RSDW80,"If there was ever any doubt about arguably the most talented actress in the history of film, Meryl Streep erases it with this performance--a characterization of such startling verisimilitude that any aspiring actress sensitive to what she accomplishes--with voice and phrasing, posture and movement, facial and vocal nuance--should immediately perish the very thought of pursuing the profession.  It's like a neophyte pianist who, upon hearing Art Tatum, vows on the spot never to practice the instrument again let alone go after a career in music.  (Of course, there will always be those ""new-age,"" ""creative"" players who compose original songs based on 3 triads  and who, upon hearing Tatum, are clueless to not merely his genius but the repertory of standards that he plays).

Not that it's a perfect performance. At times Streep's Julia verges on caricature, not because she overacts but because she's filmed--through camera positioning, angle, props, supporting actors, etc.--to appear as though she's at least 6' 8"" rather than 6' 2"".  But watching her perform in effect makes all else--direction, camera work, score, co-actors, even script--of secondary performance.  Of course it helps to have seen her in previous roles, ranging from ""Kramer vs. Kramer"" to ""Prairie Home Companion.""

It's more than the French setting and the jump cutting between France and the U.S. that causes ""Julie & Julia"" to bring to mind, more than any other film, Bernard Tavernier's ""Round Midnight,"" the best film about jazz to date.  It's difficult to say which is the more difficult to film--the making and tasting of food or the creation and enjoyment of music.  Tavernier succeeds by framing the story of an ex-patriot, ex-junkie jazz musician (played by jazz great, tenor saxophonist ""long tall"" Dexter Gordon) within the narrative of a French jazz devotee who will go to any length first to hear his hero play and then to insure that his alcoholic, addicted American jazz hero has every opportunity to draw one more breath for one more precious note.  By seeing the utter and complete devotion of the fan to  what would otherwise appear to most as the ordinary music of a decrepit musician, the spectator comes to hear the music and its importance all the more acutely.  In ""Julie &  Julia,"" Amy Adams as Julie serves much the same function, leaving no doubt about the importance of Julia along with the centrality of cooking and eating to living and loving.

The film is about lips and mouths, chewing and kissing--not necessarily ""romantically,"" since the story begins with two married couples (practically a first).  Yet it works, at least for this viewer, to a degree not seen in ""Babette's Feast.""  That film, like some others, uses food as metaphor for service and grace; this film, on the other hand, settles for singular good food and its sublime sensual enjoyment, presenting it unapologetically rather than pretending that it's symbolic of some other idea or that it's marginal to human experience.  As the film makes all too clear, food is more than our survival: to quote Julie (who sees herself as a ""foodie,"" it's our salvation.

[Husband Alert! (since most will watch this movie only with their wives): Julia's husband, Paul, is inarguably the most perfect husband ever to appear on the silver screen--not tall and handsome but an unfailingly adoring, selfless, supportive (and virile) mate who, if he hasn't been fantasized by a spouse prior to this film, will certainly become every female spouse's standard of an ideal to which few if any of us can measure up.  The male spectator's only saving grace is Julie's husband, who becomes a bit of a slacker, even abandoning his wife during her cooking obsession.  In fact, whereas Paul ultimately toasts Julia upon her greatest success in cooking, it is Julie who, in a comparable situation, toasts her husband for his support. (After leaving her when he could no longer take the ""heat in the kitchen,"" he, like a good momma's boy, comes back to her!]",1269648000,3,4006,5.022658610271903

Adams acting really brings Streep's into focus, as well as having a compelling part in the story. It's great to watch Streep as Julia, but we couldn't watch her without Julie. Julie used food to help her through life, and how few of us recognize a way to help ourselves through tough times, and how few others actually carry it out?  This is an fantastic movie, and it is not only about the story and acting, it makes you want to cook... at least, it made me want to cook!",1269302400,2,742,4.455882352941177

In other words, I had no interest in watching a film about Julia Child and some blogger named Julie.

Of course, I was hooked once the film began after numerous previews of films that I had heard of and had no interest.  The music and Paris in the late 1940's kept my attention.

Meryl Streep and Stanley Tucci as Julia and Paul Child had instant chemistry which was interwoven by the exceptional writing of Nora Ephorn as well as her superb direction to bring life out of her written words.  Amy Adams and Chris Messina as Julie and Eric Powell, the young couple living in post 911 Queens, added a parallel story line which was adeptly integrated into this film.  The two parallel stories reflected the times very well.

I have to admit the costumes, sets, and especially the vintage automobiles for Julia and Paul Child's story were outstanding.  Their love for each other came to the surface in each scene. It reminded me of the old fashioned type romance movies which Hollywood did so well in the 30's, 40's and 50's.

It was good to see Mary Lynn Rajskub from 24 playing a normal friend for a change of pace.  She did a great job and was quite comical at times.

A follow up to this film is to read the two books on which Nora Ephorn based her beautifully crafted screenplay--Julie and Julia and My Life In France.

Now for the note about the Oscars: did Meryl Streep deserve an Oscar for her performance?  You bet she did!  At least the Golden Globe recognized her acting in this fine film.

Keep in mind this film is over two hours long, but I was so engrossed with the stories that I did not mind the length.  A well crafted film is worth the time investment.

The premise behind the movie seems very gimmicky.  Not believable that someone cooked all those recipes in one year.  The food cost alone ----.  It's understandable that Julia Child's looked on the author with disdain.  But ignoring the gimmickry, we are left with a wonderful and heartwarming love story of both Julia and her husband, as well of Julia and her love of cooking.  Not the boring TV hostess at all, but quite a remarkable person.

Loved the scenery.  For those that have not been to Paris, it looks every bit as it did in the movie.  It is a timeless city that did not plunder its architectural past in the name of progress.

His actions during Julie & Julia summed it up: he would get up and do stuff at the other end of the of house during Julie Powell's personal story and come back to see if the story focused on Julia Child's life.  Why couldn't they have done a whole movie about Julia Child?  Was there any legal restrictions?  Why couldn't they have shown more cooking?  More France?  More wherever else Julia and her husband lived? There really weren't many thoughts about why Julia felt so strongly about what she was bringing to US kitchens and how it would affect our culture at the dinner table. It is not just the food but the sense of community around the table.  A director like Ang Lee or Sydney Pollock could have honored the meaning of Julia Child better.  I enjoy a lot of Nora Ephron's work.  I am not crazy about how we have to weather the uninteresting story presented of a young woman learning to cook and blog.  Meryl Streep and Stanley Tucci conveyed a lot of that.  The cast and crew in the Julia side of the story took us into that time. All the Julie side of the story presented was some priveleged, mostly happily married, self-indulgent young woman not really grasping history just meeting a goal to prove something.  Well, something to which we can look forward is the eventual really great foodie movie and great biopic that can make up for it.  Meryl Street and Stanley Tucci are worth renting this. Ang Lee's Eat, Drink, Man, Woman or even Tortilla Soup; Babette's Feast; Tampopo; Stanley Tucci and Tony Shaloub in The Big Night; even some of the funnier cooking moments in Hitchcock's Frenzy or some of the cooking tips in the Godfather movies can make up a good foodie festival.",1267488000,,1800,4.535603715170279

3975800,3,B002RSDW80,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***

  For those who haven't seen 'Julie and Julia', it's a tale of two gourmands, or gluttons depending on your perspective. There seems little doubt that 'Julie' is the weaker of the two stories as she is much lesser known compared to Julia Child, a seminal figure in the world of cookery. Julie's claim to fame was that she came up with the idea of preparing every meal featured in Julia Child's cookbook within a year's time and blogging about it over the internet. Some people describe her as a 'whiner' and certainly the use of various expletives in her blogs turned off a fair number of people (including Julia Child herself along with her original editor). Nonetheless, she did accrue a rather large following over the internet due to her witty style of writing. It's probably safe to say that Julie is more an innovator in the field of writing than cooking. Amy Adams does a fair enough job conveying the exuberance of the talented writer who is also a tad bit neurotic in her bid for public acceptance.

  The 'Julia' side of the story is far more fascinating. First of all, the recreation of Paris in 1949 is vastly more visually arresting than the blas Queens of 2002. Then there is Julia Child's story itself, which pulls you in from the start. I like how Nora Ephron didn't sugarcoat her protagonist--she could have omitted the fact that Julia Child was an avid smoker, but chose not to! Her early training at the French cooking school, replete with the conflict with an arrogant headmistress along with the distrust of her fellow male students, reveals just how determined Julia Child was to mold a career around cooking, an avocation which she absolutely adored. The jury is still out whether Meryl Streep captured the essence of the cooking icon. Some internet posters feel that her performance was all caricature but others were convinced that Streep conveyed Julia's warmth and humanity. I personally felt there was a little bit of both as Streep aimed for a mixture of verisimilitude and parody.

  What keeps us interested in 'Julie and Julia' is not only the interconnected plot but our basic curiosity in seeing how both characters manage to become successful in their field. Before becoming successful, both Julie and Julia had to both deal with rejection. With Julie, her initial failure to attract an audience to her blogs, culminating in the failure of the elderly Judith Jones (Julia's editor) to show up at the dinner and interview with the accompanying Christian Science reporter, marks the low point in her quest for acceptance; similarly, Julia must also overcome obstacles including the dissonance over a writing partner's failure to make a sufficient contribution to the book the writing team has been working on as well as the initial rejection of the book by the well-known publishing house, Houghton Mifflin. And the scenes where Julie and Julia 'succeed' are probably the most satisfying of the entire movie: in Julie's case, she receives multiple messages on her answering machine; for Julia, it's the moment she opens the letter from another big publishing house, Alfred Knopf, who finally has accepted her manuscript.

  Both Julie and Julia both have supportive husbands who figure prominently in the story. Again, the story of Julia's husband, Paul Child (ably played by Stanley Tucci) is more interesting than the story of Julie's husband, Eric. With Julie and Eric, there's a direct conflict between the couple, culminating in a fight where they stop talking to each other for a short period of time. The conflict helps to flesh out Julie's character a bit since it is Eric who accuses her of being narcissistic (not entirely without merit). But the conflict is basically standard domestic discord type of stuff. The conflict between Paul and Julia stems from Paul's situation as an employee of the U.S. Foreign Service. There is always the fear that Paul will be transferred which might throw a wrench into Julia's career aspirations. Somehow, she is accommodating and they manage to work things out.

  However, there is the larger conflict of the U.S. Government versus Paul. He's called home and investigated by higher-ups who are minions of Joe McCarthy. Somehow he manages to escape being blacklisted. Some internet posters object to Nora Ephron's liberal bias, especially in her disparagement of McCarthy sympathizers. I can only laugh at the thought that there are people who actually believe that Joe McCarthy kept America 'safe from Communism'. As someone who has read numerous biographies of Joe McCarthy, I am completely convinced that Joe McCarthy only used the issue of Communism to further his career. In fact, in 1949, McCarthy supported a group of SS men accused of murdering US Soldiers during World War II. This was his first battle with the Army; in 1954, he tried to take on the Army again during the 'Army-McCarthy' hearings, and lost.

  Once we learn of how the two principals break through with their initial success in their respective fields, 'Julie and Julia' runs out of gas. The closing credits inform the audience of the fate of the real-life Julie and Julia. The disturbing rejection of Julie by Julia Child (as well as Julia's editor) is mentioned, but never explored.

  As someone who hasn't eaten meat or poultry for thirty-five years and gave up butter and cheese about ten years ago, somehow I was not impressed by the 'eat everything you can' philosophy promoted by the film's scenarists. Perhaps in Julia Child's day it was safer to eat the food she was eating since the animals were not fed the cheap grain and shot full of hormones and antibiotics as they are today. I think I'll eschew the big Julia Child gourmet recipes for more simpler fare, as I believe eating less and exercising is the key to long life.",1267401600,,5834,4.896551724137931

The other movie, portraying Julie and her husband, was also well acted, but Julie's character is so narcissistic and terribly unlikeable. This type of movie should be a feel-good movie, but the parts with Julie and her husband are not.

3975805,2,B002RSDW80,"My mom and I are both great fans of good food and Julia Child.  We had heard the buzz over the movie Julie and Julia but missed it in the theatres.  We were both eager to taste the treat this true story was acclaimed to be and found it left a bitter taste in our mouth when the final credits floated away.

The movie is based on a book written by Julie Powell.  The movie is two parallel stories bounced back and forth from scene to scene.  The first story is the details of Powell's experience while cooking her way through one of Child's cookbooks.  Powell, played by Amy Adams, is obsessed with Julia and her daily task of completing her blog.  She lacks the finesse to juggle her hobby and her hubby making her appear frantic and whiney.  The second story being told is that of Child in the early stages of her career, played brilliantly by Meryl Streep.  This portion of the movie is actually delightful and inspiring.  My star rating would have changed significantly if this was the only story told within this movie.

Julie and Julia does not make me want to come back for seconds.  I would have enjoyed it more if the movie focused on Julia Child rather than the jarring switch between two lives.  I got the connections but found Child's upbeat attitude in too great of a contrast to Powell's whiny youth.",1266364800,6,1313,4.420833333333333
3975806,4,B002RSDW80,"I had read the book the movie is based on with the same title Julie & Julia by Julie Powell last summer before the movie was released. The movie blends the story of Julie Powell and Julia Child's life as told in the book My Life in France by Julia Child. I haven't read Julia Child's book yet. The best part of the movie for me was Meryl Streep's portrayal of Julia Child. Her acting was superb and she was very believable and I enjoyed the focus on her life. I didn't realize that she was such a passionate woman and had a very strong marriage. Stanley Tucci played the role of her husband which made for great chemistry between the two.

In all honesty, I enjoyed the parts focusing on Julia more than the focus on Julie. Since I had read the book, I was familiar with the story of Julie's project to make all the recipes in Julia Child's cookbook, Mastering the Art of French Cooking. She would do this in a year and write about her experiences in a blog. As a blogger, I loved this part and I think most bloggers would as well. The focus she had on wanting to know that there were actually people reading her blog, the excitement when she got her first comments and the realization that she had readers that supported her and were interested in reading her blog posts. Amy Adams portrayed Julie's anxieties and emotional side quite well. Although, I found her a bit too sweet compared to what I perceived of Julie through reading her book.

The food and cooking was another highlight of this movie. I enjoy foodie books and movies so I enjoyed the focus on food and cooking. I would definitely recommend this fun and enjoyable movie to foodies and bloggers and fans of Julia Child and Meryl Streep.",1266278400,,1702,4.4

The film is well directed by Nora Ephron. Sound and lighting are consistant in the film as well. Costume and  sets appear to match the period segments of the film.

I was thrilled when I found the same garlic press that Julia recommended. The funny thing was that she could not remember where she got it.
I predict that Amy Adams' body of work will be regarded as highly as Meryl Streep's when she gets to the same age. I enjoyed the scenes of Julie Powell's life just as much as the Julia Child story.  The scene with Julie Powell cooking lobsters makes me laugh every time I see it.
The only flaw that I found with the movie is that Julia Child was 37 when they moved to France. Much closer to Amy Adams' age than Meryl Streep's.  By casting other mature actors for the scenes with Meryl this fact is nicely disguised.

3975819,4,B002RSDW80,"I've never seen a movie about food I didn't like: Ratatoulli, Babette's Feast, Chocolat. Watching people who know what they're doing prepare food is entertaining - thus the popularity of the Food Network. But before there was a Food Network, there was Julia Child, who taught America to cook through her book, Mastering The Art Of French Cooking, her cooking school, and her very popular TV show. Julie And Julia is a double tale about how Julia Child got started cooking, which is humorous in itself; but also about a young woman named Julie that wanted to be like her. So Julie decides to cook all the recipes in Julia's cookbook over the course of a year, and to blog about her experiences on the Internet. This may sound tame, but it is quite an experience, and almost costs Julie her marriage and even her sanity.

The film is based on two real life stories - Julia Child's autobiography, My Life In France; and Julie And Julia by Julie Powell - about two real life couples. Meryl Streep is a hoot as Julia Child, with Stanley Tucci playing her understanding husband, Paul; and Amy Adams is good as aspiring cook and writer Julie Powell, with Chris Messina playing her patient husband, Eric. The film jumps back and forth between Julia's life in France as the wife of a diplomat (?), and Julie's life in New York as a government worker. The scenes in France are fascinating. The New York story is funny and fun and lends a human element to a story that might otherwise seem artificial. What's amazing is how cooking leads to so many romantic moments! It's good fun. PG-13

3975823,3,B002RSDW80,"It is such a shame that this film, like so many other Hollywood films, couldn't resist making spiteful, hurtful remarks about Republicans. I wish someone like Mr. Tucci or Ms. Adams (both of whom I admire) would have had the character to say, ""We shouldn't be using this film to take cheap-shots at a whole group of people we don't even know. We have no right to gratuitously insult them like this. We are, or should be, better than that."" In short, I wish those who made these decisions would have shown some class and grace. I own, and enjoy watching, Ms. Child's original cooking shows, and she never used them to engage in political posturing. You might have followed her fine example.
Having said that, I want to say thank you to those of you who were focused on making the best movie you could about two interesting people. Your hard work is apparent in many aspects of the film. I particularly want to compliment the set dressers and costumers for their outstanding work. I was also very impressed with Jane Lynch's performance as Dorothy McWilliams, Julia Child's sister. From the moment Ms. Lynch appears, the audience sees a complete, distinctive, and engaging character - a really fine job of acting by a very talented actress.",1265760000,13,1238,4.709677419354839

I found nothing remotely likeable about the character of Julie, or her husband or her friends - but I did like her cat:) Cooking her way through a cookbook, Julia Child or not, was just not believable as life changing. And were we suppose to feel sorry for her in her 'dumpy' apartment? I thought it looked pretty good to me - just the whole story line of Julia was irritating.

Meryl Streep and Stanley Tucci were pure delight - I can only hope they do another movie - maybe covering the Child's war years together.",1265673600,2,599,4.254385964912281

3975826,3,B002RSDW80,"This is a mildly entertaining movie, released in 2009.  Meryl Streep plays Julie Child, the oddly funny gourmet cook.  She has Julia's cheerful spirit, mannerisms and speech down to exquisite clarity.

Amy Adams plays Julie Powell a clerk during the day and a Julie Child Recipe Blogger at night.  She loves to cook and wants to try all of Julia Child's recipes in one year.  The movie flips to France in 1949 when Julia and her husband arrive, and then to 2002 where a young Julie Powell and her husband are striving to start a life in New York, living in a two story walk-up over a pizza parlor.

The movie combines two true stories of Julia and Julie and how they found their success in life through cooking.  This is writer-director Nora Ephron's adaptation of two bestselling memoirs:  My Life in France, by Julia Child and Julie Powell's Julie and Julia.  Julie Powell uses Julie Child's cookbook to share her recipe experiences (good and bad) on a blog.  It also helps to ""hoist"" her up into a writing career,

Meryl Streep is Julia Child and Amy Adams is Julie Powell in writer-director Nora Ephron's adaptation of two bestselling memoirs: Powell's Julie & Julia and My Life in France, by Julia Child with Alex Prudhomme.

Based on two true stories, Julie & Julia intertwines the lives of two women who, though separated by time and space, are both at loose ends...until they discover that with the right combination of passion, fearlessness and butter, anything is possible.",1265587200,,1483,4.75

I was probably giggling the most until I had to stop the disk and spend a few minutes explaining the Hollywood obsession with Senator McCarthy.  I did a little research and though Paul Child was sent back to Washington for an investigation, I found nothing that stated he was the subject of the investigation.  In fact, he came back to Washington and was promoted.  McCarthy was mentioned several times and there were a couple of republican jabs.  The worst was when Julie slept when she should have removed her dish from the oven and called in sick the next day so she could redo her dish.  She blogged about it and her bossed called her into his office because he read her blog.  He said, ""Anyone else would fire you. A Republican would fire you!""

Why? Why the unnecessary commentary.  It took us away from the plot (which is not exciting anyway).  When I first starting working, a coworker told me that I can rack up 25 attaboys but just one ""Aw crap!"" would wipe my slate clean.  This movie had several!",1265414400,27,1073,4.507772020725389

She stole the spotlight from everyone else in the film.  In fact, the engaging plot lay in the flashbacks featuring Streep and Tucci, who was also great in this underwhelming film.  A confessed foodie, I was thrilled with the story from the standpoint of the modern take on Julia and her creations.  I really wanted to be engrossed in Julie, but her pathetic whining never culminated in anything for me.  She just eventually became a successful whiner.  I didn't feel any life in Adams' performance; thus, found myself hoping her scenes would hurry by to get to more Julia.  Alas, the film crept on and never really felt like it ended.  The buildup of the story would have had more impact if it had ended about 30 minutes sooner, at the point of Julie's success.  Instead, it meandered.

In fact, it was one of the best movies we've seen in a long time.  But be forewarned.  You will be very hungry by the end of JULIE & JULIA.  You will want something to eat, preferably, something with lots of butter.

JULIE & JULIA is actually two stories, expertly blended together, each complimenting the other, and creating dish that is more than the sum of its ingredients

The first story told in JULIE & JULIA is the delicious present day story of Julia Powell, a young woman who feels that her life is going nowhere, especially when she compares herself to her high-powered friends.  Julie really wants to make a name for herself as a writer, but instead is a low level administrator who answers the phone all day long, receiving complaints and sob stories.  Jealousy and frustration with her life really come to the forefront when she finds out that one of her less talented, but high flying friends is writing an internet blog about her own life that people seem to be reading.  So Julie decides to give herself a challenge:  She will take one year and cook her way through Julia Child's famous cookbook.  As she goes, she will blog about it - 365 Days, 524 Recipes, 1 Kitchen.  At first, the only reader seems to be her mother, who is extremely less than supporting.  But, along the way, she garners a world of fans and supporters all cheering her on to complete her goal.

JULIE & JULIA's second story is that of Julia Child herself:  her life abroad with her beloved and loving husband, her search for herself, her journey through French cooking school, her desire but inability to have a child, her cookbook, and her television show.  This is a touching, tender love story - Julia's love for her husband, her love of food and cooking, and her love of life.  Never one to let obstacles get in her way, Julia lives her life to the fullest with great gusto, enthusiasm, and love.

These two stories in JULIE & JULIA are artfully blended together, with Julie's present day scenes intermingling with Julia's from the 1940's.  Most of the time, the lives of these two women seem to mirror each other, making both stories even more connected and meaningful.  The acting by Amy Adams (as Julie) and Stanley Tucci (as Julia's husband Paul) is outstanding and memorable, but it is Meryl Streep as Julia Child who brilliantly steals the show.  After we watched JULIE & JULIA, my husband found all of Julia Child's cooking shows available on PBS.  We have watched several, and Ms. Streep perfectly portrayed Ms. Child to a tee.  Her performance, in a word, is brilliant.

JULIE & JULIA is a charming, relaxing, engaging film, just right for a warm, cuddly evening at home.  It will also make you want to eat, and perhaps, it will inspire you to cook.  It did me.  Bon Apetit!",1264809600,3,2915,4.553846153846154

You see my daughter is very much into cooking, I just love to eat the food. No back where I started.. I received the DVD, so yes we are living in the middle east as expats, any arrival of a parcel is a BIG event, but the arrival of Julie and Julia was a special event!

Due to her versatile techniques,styles and convincent acting performances,she had earned huge admiration and respect as such for movie audieces as for the movie industry. This lady was born to act. She dominates brilliantly the skills of acting amazingly well that until now she owns the record as the most nominated actress in the Academy Awards history,15 nominations and two wins. For her performance in Julie & Julia she will be nominated and it seems to be,that this time she will be honor again with her third win. Although this movie tells the story of two different women in different times,it's mostly a Meryl Streep movie. She's the movie herself,without taking out merits to Amy Adams,which as a matter of fact created a charming role and was a great team with Streep.

Apparently Streep insisted to the director that Tucci be her ""Paul"" and she was right -- his expressions, his demeanor, is just classic -- watch his expressions when Julia talks about taking ""hat lessons"", or when Julia is sobbingly chopping huge piles of onions  - and spare a laugh for Julia's knife brandishing in the same scene.  The two together developed a magical chemistry that leaps out of the film and brings their characters to life.  I also loved the actors who played Louisette and Simone - her fellow gourmands. In summary, I can't think of another recent movie I have had so much fun watching.  I wish they would do a sequel remake of ""her life in France"" with these two. Their part of the movie was just too short for such a talent showcase.

However, the above is really only half the movie.  The ""Julie"" part of Julie and Julia is fine for a first watch, but I confess, I fast forward through it on the rewatches.  Julie's constant whining and her treatment of her husband is contrary to the Julia part of the movie, and is not so enjoyable to watch. I am grateful that her blog and book caused the Julia part of this movie to be made.  But on itself, the Julie part is .... just average.

I'll give another rave to the soundtrack.  Loved the Julia theme, and ""Bushel and a Peck"" and ""Time after Time"".

The blu ray extras were good, if a bit pricey.

This one is worth a buy, even if you only watch half the movie with Julia and Paul.",1264377600,,1658,4.355048859934853
3975868,5,B002RSDW80,Highly entertaining with Streep doing a fabulous job as Julia herself. Could have had more scenes of that. Funny and even learned somehting!,1264291200,2,140,5.130434782608695
3975869,4,B002RSDW80,"JULIE & JULIA was a surprisingly inspiring comedy/drama/romance that I found myself easily digesting. It wasn't just the food (although that certainly helped make me crave butter), but the easy romance that came from both the Julie side and Julia Childs' history.

Although I'd never met Julia Child, nor seen her kitchen at the Smithsonian, nor read any of her books, I did see some of her television shows growing up thanks to my mother having the channel on a local PBS station. I remember wondering what was supposed to be so interesting about this large woman who often dropped, splattered, and messed up her food preparations. Ignorance in youth is a wondrous thing.

As I grew up, I began to see Julia Childs' cookbooks all over; in friends homes, on every bookstore shelf. Hmm. Maybe I was missing something. And this movie shows me what I never understood as a kid. That this woman, this fumbling, laughing, good-natured lady, had done something that no other person had ever attempted. Not only did she invade the professional chef status of men in the kitchen, but she also made French cuisine accessible to millions of English readers.

This story, which delves beyond cooking and into romance and the dramatic life Julia led, also introduces us to a new format for would-be chefs/authors: the blog. Amy Adams (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sunshine-Cleaning/dp/B001UV4XHE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sunshine Cleaning</a>) stars as Julie Powell, a woman with a desire to be a writer (or something) but has trouble getting going. Until one day she decides to try cooking all of Julia Childs' 500-plus recipes in her ""Mastering The Art Of French Cooking"" book in 365 days ...and blogging about it. Little does Julie know of the storm of followers she'll get. This all takes place about one year post-911 in New York, too. And Julie's husband Eric (Chris Messina,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Vicky-Cristina-Barcelona/dp/B001G9F9IW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Vicky Cristina Barcelona</a>) helps push her in the blogging direction, supporting her through the successes and many disasters, including a hilarious scene involving the demise of live lobsters.

Contrasting with this is Julia Childs' life (Meryl Streep,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mamma-Mia/dp/B001GKJ2FW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mamma Mia!</a>) in the late 1940s and early 1950s as she makes her way into Chefdom. Streep's performance is astounding and made me wonder if it were possible for her to actually play a bad part. She's such a chameleon that you never saw Streep, and only witnessed Childs extraordinary rise onto the cooking world stage.  More underrated than probably any actor out there, though, is Stanley Tucci (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Devil-Wears-Prada/dp/B000JSI7BM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Devil Wears Prada</a>) as Julia's life-long husband, confidant, and lover, Paul. It was so endearing to see a man of this era support his struggling wife. He was always there for her, helping her, giving advice, photographing her ...and having a VERY healthy sex-life with her.

The contrast between Julia's early life and Julie as a writer/blogger are interesting and hold enough modern-day visuals alongside mid-20th century Europe with its cobbled streets and post-WW II drabness to keep most viewers watching and engaged, even if they're not interested in the history of American cooking.

The final point of interest for Julie & Julia is that it's funny. It is often effortlessly comical thanks to Streep's amazing performance. One particular scene that still stands out for me is when Julia meets up with her even taller sister Dorothy (Jane Lynch,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/For-Your-Consideration/dp/B000M341Q4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">For Your Consideration</a>) and the two run at each looking more like Clydesdales about to connect headlong. The aforementioned lobster scene is also hysterical (as is one where Julia has to cut into a lobster's head). These situations are filmed with such exquisite ease that you can't help but laugh at them.

Even if you have absolutely no interested in food or blogging, this film will surely have entertainment value for you. And if you are interested in either or both, beware; you just might end up ingesting more than you can handle.",1264204800,,4507,5.859756097560975

I never leave reviews for things like this but I felt like I really wanted to state how fun the movie was....I throughly enjoyed watching Meryl Streep's portrayal of Julia Child. She is such a wonderful actress! And it was so interesting to learn how she became a cook and the years and hard work that went into writing her cook book. Another wonderful element to the story was the relationship she had with her husband.  Lastly, the movie was a true honor to Julia Child, and the woman Julie who wrote the blog that started the ball rolling for the movie was also clearly talented in the kitchen.

3975874,2,B002RSDW80,"Movie - I loved it, except for the political slams, as commented on below.  Turning 30, wondering what you're doing with your life, work stress, juggling marriage, toxic friends, finding something you love to do and are passionate about, mostly likeable characters, flipping from Julia Child's life to Julie's life, I loved it all. It's also one of very few movies or TV that have lightly touched on what should or shouldn't be blogged about, which I think is long over due (on a more serious note). Just very light-hearted, endearing, and enjoyable with enough substance and story and character to make it actually matter in content. Excellent acting, enormous talent, well done.

Political slams in ENTERTAINMENT - TV, in movies,comedy, books, music etc.  I AM FED UP, I DESPISE IT.  Over the years, entertainment has become less entertaining, completely unreliable (constant cencellations after 3 episodes), endlessly repetitive (gotta fit in the mold, don't get too creative), un-imaginative (all stories must be ripped from the headlines, rather than actually written on your own), and recently totally political - sometimes directly offensive, sometimes little slams here and there.

To all of you in the business, from the very bottom to the very top, PLEASE STOP IT!!!!!!!!!!  For this movie,the problem is the latter (political slams) - I finally watch a really relaxing, witty movie, actually unique and entertaining, and they just couldn't help themselves, just couldn't make an entire movie without slipping in political slams.  I ignored all the political historical slams because for all I know, it was all actually true, and some truths about conversations have to be included and some excluded, who knows how it was chosen, and if any or all or none of it was true, it seemed like a part of the story the could legitimately belong (they hated McCarthy, Julia's father wanted the girls to marry republicans, he was a jerk at the wedding because he was a republican, her husband was investigated while working at the embassy because he was a liberal etc., it seemed to be part of the story, so it was fine). But then, In Julie's life, they had to have a current political slant even though there was nothing in the least that led you to believe any of the characters even cared about politics much less had any specific political persuasion, nothing in this present day portion of the movie had anything political about it whatsoever, nor should it have, the story was the story - for once. BUT not to those in SHOW BIZ, where everything requires some kind of political slant-someone who hates liberals or someone who hates conservatives-there's gotta be something in there to make it clear that every story needs this aspect, even if it has no business in the story.

She misses work and her boss actually says ""anyone else would fire you, a republican would fire you, but I'm not a schmuck"" How does he know she's not a republican, or her husband's not a republican, or a conservative independent, a conservative democrat who likes people no matter what party they are affiliated with?  The typical assumption is apparently that all Republicans are schmucks and only republicans and certainly all republicans fire people for missing one day of work when you had the ""flu"" but were also cooking dinner for a writer from the NY Times and blogged about it all, making it sound like you called in sick but really weren't, even though you actually were sick, but not too sick to cook for the Times.

First of all, good workers, hard working, reliable employees don't usually get fired for missing one day of work, even if it was somewhat questionable.  Secondly, I don't know if democrats or republicans fire more people, hire more people, give more or less benefits to their workers, are more or less understanding about personal lives of their employees etc.  I have no idea, and neither does ANYONE else.  I don't want my entertainment slamming democrats, republicans, independents, green party, non-party, conservatives, liberals, anyone for their political preference or social preference or religious preference etc.  If the movie is about Washington, or politics, or international relations, or anything directly related to politics or a sensitive political issue etc., have all the haters you want if that's what the story is about, but keep your political opinions out of my regular non-political movies and TV and dvd extras and books and concerts.  If it doesn't contribute to the characters, the story, the plot, STOP IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! This prejudice DOES and WILL carry over to the real world and workplace at times where you have to be afraid to tell anyone anything you believe in for fear that they will stick you in a ""box"", tag it ""R"" or ""D"" and hate you for it before ever getting to know you. Luckily, most people are good people who judge you on who you are not the ""R"" or ""D"".  But there are still some who just hate you because they are being told and taught to hate you because you have a different political persuasion.

Lately I am bombarded with hatred or nastiness or flat out prejudice in so many of my former favorite tv shows, constantly in movies, slipped into novels that have nothing whatsoever to do with politics, dvd extras in pamphlets in the package as well as commentary, non-stop in ""comedy""-as if democrats and republicans are the only two groups of people we want you to make nasty jokes about, nasty pronouncements at concerts, it is endless and I am so tired of it. Life is so hard already, why can't I get some entertainment without hate?

DOES ANYONE IN THE ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY UNDERSTAND THAT HALF THE COUNTRY IS CONSERVATIVE? I'M NOT TALKING POLITICAL PARTIES WHICH CHANGE IN MAKE-UP EVERY FEW YEARS - I'M TALKING ABOUT ACTUAL PEOPLE AND WHAT ACTUAL PEOPLE ACTUALLY THINK, BELIEVE AND FEEL. REGULAR DECENT AMERICAN PEOPLE DON'T HATE PEOPLE BECAUSE OF THEIR POLITICAL PARTY (WHICH FOR MANY WAS CHOSEN WHEN THEY TURNED 18 AND NEVER CHANGED). Regular, normal, good people, get to know people, and how they act and what they think and decide if they like them or not.  Regular people, have friends who agree with them politically and friends who completely disagree with them politically and love them and respect them all anyway. My family and friends are a haphazard mix of every party and the one thing we all agree on is the nastiness in the entertainment industry and the prejudice all over tv has got to stop.  It is not ok to throw people into two boxes and decide you hate them, that they don't deserve even the slightest bit of decency and respect just because you have labelled them with a D or an R.  In the real world, D's understand and agree with R's on many topics and R's agree with and understand D's on many issues. As for bosses, I've had two favorites in my lifetime of work - one was super conservative, the other super liberal and I respected and adored them both - they respected me, I still, all these years later, refer to them and their management styles regularly, remember what I learned from them and use it. Their politics didn't figure into that in anyway.

So how about you step out of your nasty prejudicial world for five minutes and make some good movies and good tv, and make us laugh, write good books, and entertain us with music without hating on our friends or family or even (g---forbid, ourselves, should we decide to be, hush, hush actual conservatives or liberals, depending on who you hate at the moment).

Blue Ray only features-I have no interest in Blu-Ray, not now, not ever. As for the previous reviewer who wrote about all the features you do not get as a DVD only customer, yet another knife in the back from the industry.  A few years ago, I read about and watched all over the news about how Blu-Ray ""won"" the competition with DVD and DVD was ""over"".  I was floored, Blue Ray had been out for 5 minutes, the companies met, fought, and decided, without any customer data, without caring what would happen with the future purchases or what the actual public wanted, that Blu Ray ""won"".  Another example of an industry who doesn't care what the customer wants, they will do whatever they want and force it down our throats or destroy the format we love so you are so limited that you are forced to get blu ray.  I will be the last blue-ray buyer on the planet if I have to-I tried one and prefer dvd-but now it's more because you are trying to force me to get something I don't want.  I am an electronics junky when it comes to video but I was so angry that they decided the format winner after 5 minutes (ok, maybe a little more) and no customer information that I refuse to play along and give them my money just because they demand that I decide Blu Ray is better. I'll decide, with the rest of the country/world, what I want to watch my tv/movies on, even if I have to buy it used!

Since I'm ranting and giving advice, how about all the industries who want us to have no choice but to buy their product, that we may not want, actually give us choices - the freedom to choose what we like best and then manufacture it so it is a quality item that lasts, so we trust your company and want to buy more products from you, and whatever is popular - by purchase and use, not by force and elimination of choice, is the product that should continue to be manufactured on a larger scale?  Try it, you might like having customers that buy from you because they want your products, like them, and trust that you make quality items.  Rather than the current status quo of shoving something new down our throats,when we all just finally got the previous version, making it cheaply so it doesn't last(while charging a fortune) and we have to keep coming back to fight about warranties and parts, and customers are constantly changing brands because nobody can be trusted, and your taking away or destroying that which we enjoy so that what you want us to enjoy is our only choice - even though it is more expensive, not-compatible with many previous items, poor quality, and not noticably any better than what we had before and by the time we finally accept it - there you go again, forcing something else down our throats.  Just give us the choices, and we'll decide which one is better.  Make new products, and we'll decide if we want them - not because you stopped making everything else or gave less and less options for what we actually already own and prefer, but because we want it or it is better.

THE REVIEW/RANT IS NOW OVER. I know, it;s just a movie, but sometimes, it's not just a movie, it's an example of so many things wrong with this industry.",1263859200,6,10671,4.6736
3975875,4,B002RSDW80,"I wanted to see this movie for a couple of reasons: the previews showed Streep as Julia Child and they could have been twin sisters.  Secondly, I have often wondered about Julia and what she has done to the world of American cooking.  Her TV show was really the first ""reality"" show on cooking -- we now take the Food Network for granted, but it was a breath of fresh air to enjoy a cooking show with Julia Child back in the Sixties and Seventies.

A woman wrote a book about following Julia's recipes and this film is her story -- or rather, half the story.

Julie Powell has just moved to a dumpy apartment above a pizza place in Queens.

Julie Child has just moved to a nice place in Versailles, France to be with her husband, Paul.

Both Julies are paralleled throughout the film.  We get to see their losses and loves and their goals and purposes throughout the movie.

What this movie has is heart.  The editing has been done in a fashion where the Julia Child story is endearing.  Child has no real purpose and realizes with her husband, Hey, why not learn how to cook?  And that extrapolates to Hey, let's write a cookbook on French cooking for American wives and mothers.

Powell has no real purpose, either.  She's humiliated by her snotty friends and wants to do more than her dead-end job as a customer service person.  I'm sure those who've done customer service can relate to the abuse she puts up with.  It's revealing.

Just as Child's husband suggests cooking and writing, so Powell's husband suggests cooking and blogging about it.

One good thing about the present time is that it is a lot easier to be your own publisher on a web blog.  It's really a vehicle that when you garner enough attention could (or could not) lead to other more lucrative pursuits.

There is a point in the film when the Child in present time comments through a reporter that Powell's blog is not ""respectful"" and Powell promptly collapses, until her husband reminds her that it's the ""Julia Child"" in her mind that is perfect, not the actual one.

It's interesting how we blow up to godhood a person we look up to and are amazed that they really are just human.

The director of the piece also shows us people in both ""films"" that want to tear down Julie and Julia, telling them their ideas for publication or bad, that they will never be a pro cook or writer and just give up.

Powell nearly does.  There are a few scenes out of Kitchen Nightmares that are hard to watch.

They even squeezed in the Monty Python skit on Julia Child as he spurts fake blood all over a chicken!

I have not read the book that this film is based, but so far I was quite entertained.  Meryle Streep outshines Amy Adams for sure.  In fact, Meryle's character is a bit too perfect.  Amy Adams' character is a lot more flawed, angry, and self-absorbed to the point of threatening her marriage.  Julia Child's marriage is strained too, with McCarthyism (though this is underplayed, really).

If the film were reduced about twenty minutes and made Julie Powell a little less wildly dysfunctional, it would have been a better film.

Loved the music, really carried the mood.

Meryl Streep never ceases to amaze me with her talent as Julia Child who gets the idea to publish a book for Americans on French Cooking.  She takes classes with some snooty men and is so determined to outdo them.

Julie, lives in Long Island City and by day travels to the city to be a customer service rep.  She also has a lunch with her own ""snooty friends.  Her ""friends"" are too busy firing people and using their Blackberrys to take notice of Julie.

Julie starts a blog where she will cook one of Julia Child's recipes and give her opinion.  The blog starts becoming poplular and soon a food critic wants to come to her house.

There's confusion about McCarthy and HUAC, I suspect, as is normal for Hollywood revisionism of this era. If it's as depicted, that's terrible, but the problem is that Hollywood has distorted this issue so much that my first reaction is skepticism. I don't know if people were questioned about their homosexual tendencies by HUAC, but I do know that it was McCarthy's enemies, including the liberal media, who were constanty gay-baiting during that time, while McCarthy staunchly defended his homosexual associates.

Amy Adams is good as the blogging Child devotee who takes on the task of recreating every recipe in Child's seminal cookbook, and together these two actresses deliver a very nice treat of a movie.
The movie criss-crosses back and forth between Child's years in France and Julie Powell's years in Queens and the similarities are fascinating. Dual story lines only work if they are woven together to make a greater product, and so it is with Julie and Julia.
Underscoring the storyline regarding Julie's daunting undertaking are the twin relationships of the ladies. Streep and Tucci (both are always so good) bring such a warmth and believability to their supremely supportive marriage. On the other hand, Adams and Chris Messina as her husband Eric, do a good job of showing a different albeit equally loving marriage, strained at times by the mania of Julie's increasingly self-absorbed lifestyle.

Julia Child is a expat in 1960's Paris with modest origins who develops into a world-famous chef. Julie Powell is a lost Gen X-er living in present-day NYC desperate for an outlet in her life. She stumbles onto Child's enormous Mastering the Art of French Cooking and begins to write a blog detailing her life and luck as she goes through every recipe in the book (yep, that includes aspics- ick). The two storylines are quite different but share similarities, as Child tries to improve her cooking skills and get the cookbook published, and Powell gets more consumed with what was once an innocent hobby in the hopes of being taken seriously as a writer. That's the gist of the film, which is very fun and great to look at but not offering much else. Meryl Streep, of course, is a standout, in a performance that is by turns mannered and lived-in. She elevates the film to a higher level by her lighthearted presence and careful optimism. Amy Adams, on the other hand, comes right out of the Eat, Pray, Love school of aimless NYC women with a slightly sophisticated way with words. In the end her enlightenment is nice enough, but is ultimately bland. Still, the film is highly entertaining, and is as light and enjoyable as any dessert available in Child's book.",1263340800,,1368,4.610655737704918

For anyone who came of age in the second half of the 20th Century, Julia Child was the ""chef de cuisine professionnel"" of home cooking.  Every week, millions of housewives and wannabe culinary artists would tune into her TV show or pore over her many cookbooks in an attempt to reproduce the master's recipes.  With her distinctive high-pitched shrill, her folksy sayings and trademark pearls, Child brought gourmet French cooking to the masses and turned herself into an instantly recognizable cultural icon in the process.

""Julie & Julia"" is not a ""biography"" in the traditional sense of that term, but rather a melding of dual stories culled from two separate sources - ""My Life in France"" by Child and Alex Prud`homme and ""Julie and Julia:  My Year of Cooking Dangerously"" by Julie Powell.  The latter is a writer who, in 2002, decided to work her way through every one of the 524 recipes in Child's ""Mastering the Art of French Cooking"" while posting her results on a daily blog.  The site soon became a sensation among internet readers who shared Powell's passion for all things cooking and Child.

In blending the two books into a single work, Nora Ephron has created a tasty, if somewhat lopsided, confection.  One of the inherent weaknesses in the approach is that Meryl Streep so dominates the screen with her interpretation of Child that her side of the story all but steamrolls over the more contemporary side, where Amy Adams is stuck trying to add spice to the far more bland and flavorless Powell.  Time and again, just as we're becoming intrigued by Child's evolution from restless housewife - living with her ambassador husband (Stanley Tucci) in Paris - to student at LeCordon Bleu to published author, we're suddenly thrust back into the infinitely less compelling world of our modern-day blogger, who often comes across as needy, self-indulgent, creepily obsessive and whiny.  Frankly, I'm amazed all her friends didn't take her off speed-dial for the duration.  In addition, the husbands in the film (Tucci and Chris Messina) are completely lacking in charisma and personality.

Still, Streep - despite an ever-so-slight tendency towards coyness and cutesiness - is a genuine hoot and, like a good yeast, makes even the flatter parts of her story rise to the occasion.  Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for Adams.  In the case of ""Julie & Julia,"" the wrong J gets top billing.",1263168000,5,2411,4.933168316831683

I think that Meryl Streep does an excellent job as Julia and Stanley Tucci is perfect as Paul Child.

It felt like Julia Child was being used to ""prop up"" the weaker story of Julie Powell.  While the story of Julie Powell and her blog is cute and enjoyable, after she completes all of Julia's 540+ recipes, her story has nothing much left to say.  By contrast, Julia Child's message is timeless and will continue to delight and inspire.

Julie is tedious, a self-absorbed, vain, selfish, and boring affectatious jerk. (I was hardly surprised to read that she has had a few, umm, marital issues since her success.) Julia is wild and crazy, but unreal. How this flighty and high-strung wacko could do what the real Julia did is not plausible.

It takes a very little person to subject an audience to annoying winks and nods while congratulating herself and then picking their pockets. I could care less about what Ephron thinks of Democrats or Republicans and I wish she would be professional enough to keep it to herself and just tell the story. I am aware of Child's political views but some of the nasty little asides were way out of context.

That being said, the film has some wonderful moments. Streep is especially good as Julia Child. The movie lags in the last half and had me wondering if the director or the writer loved everything they were doing a little too much. It could use a trim.

3975911,4,B002RSDW80,"1949--Julia Child (Streep) moves with her husband Paul (Tucci) to France.  She can't figure out what to do with herself.  Paul encourages her to do the thing she loves--that's eat.  Despite the fact that she cannot boil an egg, she goes to the Cordon Bleu and learns French cuisine. Almost ten years later, she's the author of the first French cookbook for American women.

2002--Julie's (Adams) dreams of becoming a writer are almost done. The editor of the Amherst literary rag and the girl most likely is now a mid-level bureaucrat in a job that doesn't fulfill her and 900 square foot apartment that is closing in more and more by the day. Eric (Messina), her husband, encourages her to find something she loves to do to complete her.  She loves to cook, so she decides to go through Child's cookbook for a while year and blog the experience.

The two women's stories are told in parallel, so you can see how much the pair do have in common.  The performances by the quartet of leading actors is excellent.

WARNING:  This film may well be a diet buster.  Everyone I have talked to says you're going to want to eat after you've seen it and they are right.  You might as well have a dinner at a fine French restaurant planned for afterward--or at the least, make up a bowl of buttered popcorn.

To make a movie about two women in two different period of time is a challenge to write and to direct.  Director Nora Ephron did her best to bring the two worlds together.  It didn't meld, however.  Something was lacking in this movie - a WOW factor.  It was interesting to see Julia Child as a young American woman in France and to see Julie Powell (who's book this movie was based on) as a young working wife from Queens.  Meryl Streep and Amy Adams were great, as was Stanley Tucci.  So the acting wasn't the problem.  I think the problem was in the screenplay.  It was too bland.  It needed more pizzazz.

3975919,3,B002RSDW80,"The latest film directed by Nora Ephron (""You've Got Mail"") is titled ""Julie & Julia."" This is strange. Why not ""Julia & Julie"" or simply ""Julia Child""?

The 123-minute film employs a double narrative, following the stories of ""Julia"" and ""Julie"" one after the other. Julia is Julia Child (played by Meryl Streep), American chef, TV personality and author of ""Mastering the Art of French Cooking"" published in 1961; Julie is Julie Powell (played by Amy Adams), New York blogger who in 2002 started writing about her experiences about cooking all the recipes in Julia Child's book. The film is virtually two memoirs in one.

Nora Ephron's comedy drama switches between the two stories, Julia's and Julie's, trying to connect one to the other by highlighting their similarities. Both Julia and Julie have understanding husbands, Paul Child (Stanley Tucci) and Eric Powell (Chris Messina); both experiences ups and downs in their quest, and both have their books published. Nora Ephron's intention is clear, but the more the film compares their lives, the more obvious the film's flaw becomes.

For Julia Child's life story is far more interesting and amazing than the other one. This is not to say the Julie Powell part is uninteresting. It is just that it pales in comparison. Look how Julia Child enters the all-men cooking school in post-war France and practices chopping onions in her Paris apartment. All these things could be hard and tiresome to anyone, but Julia Child does it with such grace and humor.

The most impressive part of ""Julie & Julia"" is, not surprisingly, Meryl Streep's delightful and convincing portrayal of the iconic chef. But we should not forget equally wonderful performance from Stanley Tucci as her loving husband.

If you think you've seen Meryl do everything you really haven't until you see her performance in this movie.  She is absolutely superb in the difficult role of someone we all knew so well.  In the hands of a lesser actress, the very mannered Julia would have come off as a foolish parody.  Streep infuses her performance with every detail of Julia's joy and spirit.

Norah Ephron has brought Julie Powell's book to life - the story of modern day Julie finding her voice by writing a blog about cooking every recipe in Julia Child's ground breaking book, Mastering the Art of French Cooking.  At the same time we experience Julia Child's self discovery in post-war Paris studying the culinary arts and writing her book, based on her recollections in the book, My Life in France.

Ephron expertly contrasts the two eras of the leading characters who never meet, although Ms. Child was alive at the time.  You will be happy to know that Ms. Child's 6'2"" stature is believably recreated.

Besides Ms. Streep, there is also the fine performance of Stanley Tucci as Paul Child.

What I didn't like was the character of modern day Julie. Her scenes are very weak compared to the Paris scenes with Julia.  Amy Adams does what she can with the role, but Julie is a mousy, put-upon and passive bore who is not interesting enough to carry her part of the story.  The overacting of Chris Messina as her scruffy husband is distracting.

Note that on this DVD the sound is poorly mixed and requires constant increasing and lowering of the volume.

3975926,4,B002RSDW80,"As a young American boy growing up in rural France, I learned early on that French cooking can be sublime and that the key to healthy eating is really enjoying your food.  While my American cousins in the US had their birthday parties at Chuck E. Cheese and played ""pin the tail on the donkey"" and ""musical chairs,"" we had many parties at which the only activity would be cooking contests.  Ecah child would get three ingredients upon entering the maison, and was told to make the best dish he or she could manage within, say, a two and a half hour cooking time.  The winner got a special prize of a blue ribbon, the traditiona; ""cordon bleu"" of the master chef.  When Julia Child (played by Meryl Streep) came to France, she was childless and felt the absence of living children ruefully.  It was all the more ironic, my mother told us, that her last name was ""Child.""  Streep maybe overplays this a little bit, for when you see the movie, and Meryl Streep is bustling across a town square and she happens to see a child, which she must have seen daily, she crumples her face and clutches the hand of Paul Child (played by Stanley Tucci) and understanding Paul must cheer her up, usually by taking her to a three star restaurant and ordering some boned fish.

I feel that if Julie Powell (played by Amy Adams) had had children too, or even cared about them, the dynamic of Nora Ephron's popular 2009 biopic would have altered considerably.  As one watches Julie & Julia today, does no one flash on Luis Bunuel's That Osbcure Object of Desire and his use of Angela Molina and Carole Bouquet to play the same part (Conchita)?  To me Ephron was trying to pull off something of the surrealist impudence of Bunuel and she's certainly earned the right to go there, after all those movies with Meg Ryan.

We kept waiting for Julie's cat to have a reaction shot all its own, and finally in the very last reel of the movie there it is.  The cat stretches out in spastic ecstasy (looks like an expensive CGI shot) at something extraordinary in Julie Powell's change of heart.  I love when directors cut to the pet of the main characters to signal how animals see behind temporary misunderstandings to penetrate right to the heart of a cute situation.

I also was reminded of The Wizard of Oz as Meryl Streep walks around urban Paris and everyone is shorter than her.  They must have picked little people to play the little people.  And say, when did Meryl Streep become to go-to girl for expressions of delight and pleasure?  In this movie and in Mamma Mia, every frame has her breaking into ecstatic smiles at how fabulous foreign people are (food too).

3975927,2,B002RSDW80,"This is a real sloppy mess of a movie, one that is far too ambitious and fails in virtually all of its goals. I'd give it one star, but that seems a little cruel. Where to start with this film's many faults?

1) Julia Child clearly led a life interesting enough to be worthy of a movie all of her own, and yet she has to share the spotlight with a frustrated up and coming New York blogger who decides to cook her way through Child's cookbook within a year. The constant switching back and forth doesn't really work.

2) By her own high standards, Streep acts poorly. Adopting a fake accent and twisting your face into paroxysms of delight every time you come across French food does not a great performance make.

3) The film treats Child with too much reverence and makes little effort to explain her motivation. Sure, she was bored abroad, and sure, she liked cooking, but that applies to a lot of other people too. What really made her tick? We don't learn.

4) The direction sucks. I'm sorry, but there is no polite way to say this. The film is far too long and there is no sense of tension to drive it forwards. It has all the dynamism of a napping hamster. We are treated to an endless cycle of ""This happened in France, and then that happened, and here we are in New York, and this happened, and that happened, and here we are back in France"". It could easily have lost 30 minutes without anyone noticing. Oh look, here we are, watching Julia discussing her book in a most boring fashion yet again with her French co-writers. Cut, cut, cut.

  I believe I am in a small minority here, but I thought the one part of the movie that did work was the part which focussed on blogger Julie Powell. The tale of a frustrated writer stuck in a stressful and unfulfilling job was well told and made sense and -- crucially -- we could understand her motivation.

1.  Julia's part of the movie is about her translating a French cook book into English and getting it published.  That is it!  Forget about that she worked for the OSS during WW II in China and met her husband.  Forget about that she wanted children but couldn't.  Forget about her sister and her fammily life.  Forget about her husband and the  Macarty investigation.  All of these were shown in the movie and could have been left out because they don't do anything to move the story along.  They would have made a better movie, but no.
2. Julia is a failed writer, has a boring job, lives in a cramped apartment, and has a ""saint"" or ""wimp"" of a husband.  Her story is about her cooking every recipe in Julia's French cook book in 365 days and blogging about it.  Thrilling!!!???  Who cares?  That is the point, there is no reason to care about her or anyone else in this movie.  I am a gourmet cook and there is one thing I do know and that is: cooking Julia Child's recipes correctly is expensive!  Where does Julie get the money to do all of this?
3.  The acting is one note for both.  Streep has the accent and mannerisms down but no depth of character.  Adams has.... I don't know what but I didn't care.
4. There was no why in this movie.  Why do I want to know about these people? Why do I care about French cooking? Why do I care about Julie's blog?  Why?
5. Why did the writer/director mention the fact that Julia Child hated Julie Powell's blog and not explain it?
6. The Saturday Night Live skit showing the actor making fun of Child by cutting off his thumb under cuts the revernce that Julie had for Child.
7. Julile Powell's husband comes off as a ""wimp"" with no back bone and no personality.  Julia Child's husband comes across as supportive and charming, that is because of Tucci, who is a great actor.
8.  The writng is the bad guy in this and the director wrote it so she is at fault.  At 123 minutes there are 30 minutes that could have been cut out.  That would not have saved this movie but it would have made this review shorter.
9. A P.S. if the gossip about Powell and what happened to her is true then there would have been a good ""trashy"" movie.  Look up what happen to her life and you will see.",1262217600,14,2542,4.209109730848861

In the 1950's, Julia begins to master the art of French cooking, and tries to get a cook-book published. In the year 2002, Julie Powell takes Julia's cook-book and begins to cook meals each day for a year, and writes about it in her blog. I highly recommend JULIE & JULIA!!!",1262131200,,418,4.2375

I hadn't heard of the book or the blog by the based-on-real-life Julie but I did know that there were two story arcs going on throughout the movie simultaneously.  I had no idea how that could work but I did.  The lives of Julia Child and Julie worked in such a wonderful parallel.  Once again, the acting was superb.  Amy Adams is a delight and Meryl Streep gave it all as Julia Child.  At times she was bordering on more of an impression than an interpretation of Julia but it didn't deter from my movie experience.

From what I can tell, Julie Powell is kind of a pill.  The relationship between Julie and her husband felt very real.  The relationship between Julia and Paul - completely magical.  Kudos to Streep and Tucci.  Stanley Tucci gives a somewhat subdued performance which just showcases his fine acting skills.  I hope he is recognized come awards time.

I would like to believe if we had computers back then I too could have done a successful blog as I learned to cook my way thru it. So good for Julie! I also followed Julia Child's life and have read every book about her and by her, plus watched all of her TV shows and interviews.

I started watching this movie for entertainment and that is what I got! Pure lively, funny, absolute entertainment. BTW my husband loved it also. I thought Nora Ephron did a stellar job of combining the two stories. As soon as the movie ended I took Mastering and ""My Life in France"" and handed them to my husband so he could see where the Julia story came from.

The cook, Julia, appeared drunk throughout the entire film - it was funny for about the first thiry minutes, but then it was just annoying. Added to this was the whimpering and odd behaviour of Julie and the movie just became boring and tiresome.

Other reviewers have mentioned my last point, and I will too, there was too much focus on ""let's have sex"". The amount of references to sex in relation to the theme of the story was out of balance and unnecessary as it didn't add anything to the story.

Seeing the movie before reading either book, I certainly got the impression that Julie was depicted as a sweet, somewhat obsessed, Meg Ryan character.

3975942,3,B002RSDW80,"If this had only been a doccudrama about Julia Child's enduring impact on history and culture (Iron Jawed Angels, Warm Springs...etc) we would have been okay.

But the script recipe lacked coherent direction AND had a unneccessry character thrown in. It seemed like 'Julie' was merely inserted to make Julia's life seem 'current' and hip to the viewing audience.

This inadvertently established and then reinforced an incorrect assumption that people are unable to gennuinely learn from each other, irrespective of our generations. I am among the people who felt she was an uneccessary ingredient in this film.

Much like the Julia who becomes dimissive of her younger admirer, the screenwriters gloss over Julia's background in a McCarthy Era civil service--to the film's detriment.

In today's 'security concious' era, having the background in that part of the story would have provided important and substantive ideas to chew on. How much protection is too much?

The scenes where Child is sitting before the McCarthy 'anticommunist' committee are really chilling! Perhaps we're going back to that point in time without actually wanting to openly acknowllege it.

And they never actually examine the MANY obstacles which she had to encounter in order to learn her 'traditional' craft and then peddle it to the 'happy homemaker'.

Contrasting with the idylic image which this woman successfully projected through books and television, she was a serious business worker. She understood what it took for women to succeede in the business world because she was herself trying to break through against tremendous odds.

Had this script been allowed to cook for a while longer before having hit the theaters--audiences would have had a very delicious dish to feast on.",1261872000,,1765,5.2562277580071175

Other story overlapped is that of Julia. She also is searching for meaning in life and finds she has a unique culinary skill and panache for violent processing of food. This is quit fun viewing.

I immensely enjoyed the interspersed sections that display Julia Child (Meryl Streep) and her husband Paul Child (Stanley Tucci) as you could see their enthusiasm and depth of acting. This could have been great docudrama. The one-dimensional tripe if the interspersed Julie Powell (Amy Adams) could have been left out and nothing would have been missed.

I have only seen the Blu-ray and cannot compare to other forms or media. For the people interested in the media the special features contend the standard as a commentary with Writer/Director Nora Ephron. One advantage is you can fast forward with sound through the Julie parts.

3975950,5,B002RSDW80,"I'm part French, took a vacation in France and came away with the opinion that there is nothing as delicious as French food. To me everything I tried was exquisite and unforgettable. In recent years I've tried some of Julia Child's recipes and adapted her boeuf bourguignon (beef stew) - I use less burgundy. So when I heard about this movie and decided to wait for it to come out on DVD I'm glad I did. It was much more cozy to watch it at home.

My first impression of the movie was that it was brilliant mostly due to Meryl Streep's mind-blowingly-accurate portrayal of Julia Child's personality. I've been watching The French Chef TV shows and have gained a deeper understanding of her cooking techniques, mannerisms and vocal inflections.  Meryl Streep captures something of Julia Child's soul and allows the viewer to fall in love with the idea of Julia Child.

Amy Adams is perfect for the role of Julie, she has just enough obsessiveness to get the job done. Making all the recipes in Mastering the art of French Cooking is a formidable task and she has a very small apartment kitchen. Her trials and tribulations, meltdowns and spectacular successes make the movie feel real and lets the viewer ride along with emotional upheavals and disappointments when Judith Jones (a famous editor) doesn't make it to dinner. The other upsetting part in the movie is information about Julia Child not liking Julie's Blog. This is devastating to her and she loves Julia Child and wants to meet her.

This movie will make you run out to buy:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mastering-the-Art-of-French-Cooking-2-Volume-Set/dp/0307593525/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mastering the Art of French Cooking (2 Volume Set)</a>&nbsp;so you can try all these recipes yourself. It is really a jumping off point for your own journey of discovery. I felt this
movie made cooking very exciting.

As someone who has received a rejection letter from Judith Jones (she writes very nice ones) I felt a strange connection to the story. My cookbook had to be rewritten since she told me my recipe instructions were too truncated - so I changed the entire book. I think she would like the new version that I have published myself.

I felt very emotional while watching this movie. It had so many dreams and hopes that eventually become realities. I love very few movies and this one captured me completely.

3975951,2,B002RSDW80,"I am not sure what's with all the glowing reviews...

I hit play and the movie started with a Child-like voice and a glowing, beautiful performance by Streeps. I was so excited, partly because I was about to watch the becoming of Julia into Julia Child, who made me love cooking.

Lo and behold, the movie is cut off before it starts and there goes Child (or, rather, Streeps' beautiful performance of her). And she comes back sporadically, with very little information about what she is learning, what she is doing with what she is learning, or how she is enjoying it... Oh yes, she is trying to write a book after learning how to cook in Paris. Uhm, that's it. Bits and pieces that could have added texture to that bland summary becomes forgotten as, more and more, the movie hides Julia behind Julie...

Yes, yes; Julie's story links to Julia's, but it is Julia's life that is significantly rich with texture (according to the movie that gives you bits and pieces --I didn't read about her life), not Julie's, which is (seemingly, according to the movie) a narrative of neurotic self-absortion (of self) and idolization (of Julia), overly salted with nervous break downs and peppered by Hollywood-style ""relationship crises"" (of Julie).

One could do wonders with the story-to-be-written, but one did not.

And where is the narration of Child's work? How do you sidestep the very content of someone's work (except how to bone a duck and sear meat) while ""telling"" her life?

As a sidenote (in case someone knows something about Child's life), in the movie, Child seems to be using the same enamel cast iron dutch iron (available at Marshalls for $40) for the duration of the movie, which I think is ~10 years or so. Was that dutch oven something special to her, or was that just in-movie advertisement?

If I had no expectations from this movie, I'd give it 5 stars simply for Streeps' performance. Unfortunately, I had :(",1261612800,3,1925,4.728358208955224
3975952,4,B002RSDW80,"""Julie & Julia"" is a thematic biopic based on two sets of memoirs: blogger Julie Powell's book ""Julie & Julia: 365 Days, 524 Recipes, 1 Tiny Apartment Kitchen"" and Julia Child's memoir ""My Life in France"", co-written with her great-nephew Alex Prud'homme in the last years of her life. Nora Ephron writes and directs these stories to run parallel, whisking the audience back-and-forth between picturesque post-War Paris and Julie Powell's dismal 2nd floor walk-up in Queens in 2002. Powell was a government worker who spent her days fielding calls from the families of 9/11 victims. Feeling aimless and dissatisfied, she decided to set a personal goal: To cook all 524 recipes from Julia Child's classic work ""Mastering the Art of French Cooking"" in one year and blog about the experience.

Eventually Powell's blog attracted a following, caught the eye of the press, and resulted in a book deal. So ""Julie & Julia"" has the distinction of being the first feature film based on a blog, or partly so. We not only see Julia Child's (Meryl Streep) first forays into French cooking in the early 1950s and her struggle to get her groundbreaking cookbook, written with collaborator Simone Beck (Linda Emond), published but also the lifestyle and self-image of two different times and generations contrasted. Julia Child was an upper-middle class wife of a career Foreign Service employee (Stanley Tucci), taking in the City of Lights from her beautiful apartment, an American housewife in Paris trying to find something constructive to do.

Julie Powell (Amy Adams) is a working class Gen X bureaucrat and frustrated writer. Child seems unfazed by any obstacle and always optimistic. Powell is self-absorbed and difficult to live with. Nora Ephron tries to emphasize their similarities through cross-cutting: They had both been government workers. They both had supportive and tolerant husbands. They were both consumed by a writing project, and they both loved good food. There's no question that the Julia Child half of ""Julie & Julia"" is more engaging. Meryl Streep captures Child's enthusiasm and can-do spirit with gusto, without doing a straight imitation. She is Child as Powell imagines her and as Child portrayed herself. Paul Tucci is the unsung hero of the film with his quiet portrayal of adoring husband Paul Childs.

Julie Powell has been sweetened up a bit for the film. Amy Adams' characterization, though it may make Powell more appealing, also rings false at times. It conflicts with her behavior. A more realistic and abrasive Julie Powell might have been more interesting, but that would give the film an entirely different tone -that of a sociological study in contrasts, not an upbeat movie about one cook's enduring ability to inspire. Whether or not one finds Julie Powell likable, she set an impressive goal, worked toward it hours each day for an entire year, and accomplished it. The publicity she generated has introduced the younger generations to Julia Child. ""Julie & Julia"" is enjoyable and can do nothing but enhance and perpetuate Julia Child's reputation as a great and vivacious advocate of good food.

The DVD (Columbia 2009): There is one featurette and an audio commentary. ""Secret Ingredient: Creating Julie & Julia"" (27 min) interviews director Nora Ephron, members of Julia Child's family, the cast, and creative crew about the characters, sets, costumes, the food, and working on the film. The audio commentary by Nora Ephron is sporadic, but she talks about some of the differences between the movie and the real stories, locations, her own cooking experiences, and more. Subtitles for the film are available in English (also available for the commentary) and French. Dubbing is available in English DVS and French.",1261612800,2,3752,5.1358428805237315
3975953,2,B002RSDW80,"I want to start by saying that this is not a simple case of `Meryl Streep is better than Amy Adams' even if a lot of other reviewers want to paint it as that.  This is much more complicated than that.  In fact, Amy Adams is fine here.  She has her moments of charming, her moments of intensity, her moments of hysteria and overall she is adequate.  The real issue I have with `Julie & Julia' is that it doesn't live up to the subject matter and the script is a sloppy and uninspired mess.

That, and a few `other' things.

The film shifts from Julia Child's life in Paris and Julie Powell's life in New York.  Streep portrays Child as she begins to take a hold of her own identity, learning to cook and channeling her good-natured mentality into a healthy and respectable career.  Adams portrays Powell as she tries to break away from the downtrodden near pathetic path she has chosen by finding herself in Julia Child's recipes.  It is clear that Powell is inspired and in awe of Child and wants to feel a connection with her.

For me, this all sounds like it could produce delicious results.  Sadly, this meal is rather bland.

I'm going to go ahead and start with the acting, since that is what is getting all the attention.  When I first saw this film in the theater all those months ago, it was the first bit `potential Oscar contender'.  Everyone had been raving Streep as `on her way to the podium for her THIRD Oscar' and so I was excited.  I love Meryl Streep.  When I walked out of this film I thought to myself, `she was good, and funny, and charming, but there is no way she is the best'.  Then I saw a few other films (`Bright Star' and `An Education' to be exact) and there was no question in my mind that what Carey Mulligan does in `An Education' is not only the best performance of this year, but is a complete marvel and one of the best performances in any category of this ENTIRE DECADE.  After watching this film for a second time last night I found myself even MORE confused about Streep's Oscar buzz (and countless critic award wins).  Meryl Streep is undoubtedly a force in front of the camera.  Nearly everything she does is phenomenal.  Sadly, for me, her performance here is a tad too far over the top.  She is hammy and, while that quality can at times be appealing (her constant jovialness is infective), the script is so dense and hollow that it barely allows Streep to expound on the WOMAN that was Julia Child.  There are subtle hints that something is brewing beneath the surface (her sincere breakdown after learning of her sister's pregnancy) but this film is more focused on the food (which all looks delicious BTW) than giving us a real taste of who Julia was as a person.

Streep is entertaining, but she is FAR from Oscar worthy.

Like I said, Amy Adams is adequate.  She doesn't really do anything wrong, but the whole idea of her character and her life is far too clichd to be anything noteworthy.  The snag in her marriage and that whole FORCED breakup is ridiculous, but totally something you saw coming the moment she said, in her blog, that she was `risking her marriage' for this experiment.  Her manic desperation can at times be endearing and entertaining, but nothing we haven't seen a million times before.

As far as the significant others go, Stanley Tucci is the best thing about this movie (end of discussion) and Chris Messina is the worst.  I love the quiet and supportive nature of Stanley Tucci.  He just has this softness and this endearing quality to him.  I adored him in `The Devil Wears Prada' and I find his work here, alongside Streep, to be equal parts charming and engaging.  His warmth never feels forced or awkward (in contrast, when Adams delivers the SAME TOAST she fails miserably at giving it any kind of natural affection).  Messina is just an obnoxious stereotype who fails to do anything by overwork his character, and that disgusting way he eats his food haunts my dreams.

In the end, the biggest culprit here is Nora Ephron, the films director and screenwriter.  Because of her, the film lacks any real bite whatsoever.  It is bland and boring, overly long and full of generic clichs that make this far less than a film of its nature should be.  This is supposed to be an inspirational `coming of age', romantic comedy set to the tone of a biopic, but it lacks any of the chemistry and warmth that make those specific film genres so lovely.",1261612800,25,4418,4.483103879849812

3975955,5,B002RSDW80,"I just adored this movie.  The acting was soooo good, I could almost smell the food they were cooking.  Amy Adams was perfect for the part and Meryl Streep couldn't be better.  I've loved most all Meryl Streep films anyway, but this one will be right at the top of my list. I really enjoy ""feel good"" movies, so much better than flying human like cartoons, spy movies and fast cars, so this one really made me feel good.  I do watch and enjoy some of the chefs on Food TV, though I must say some of them are awful.  In this film, I felt like I was right there in Julia's and Julie's kitchens and wished I could sit down to dinner.

The comments made about the politics in the film, were obviously made in ignorance or by right wing Repub. who were not adults during the early 50's.  Those of us who lived during that era can't help remembering how frightening and wicked Sen. McCarthy was.  In a speech delivered in Green Bay, Eisenhower declared that he disagreed with McCarthy's methods. Today the term McCarthyism is used more generally to describe demagogic, reckless, and unsubstantiated accusations, as well as public attacks on the character or patriotism of political opponents. I'm glad they included it. Her husband was a part of the film and helped with the book while he was in the government at that time and after he retired.  Julia had also been part of the government during the war years.  It was right to include it. Perhaps those critical of the inclusion of the politics would have preferred merely a cooking film, but you can see those on TV all day long and most have not written a book that changed the way Americans eat.",1261526400,,1644,4.468227424749164

Streeps performance once again was fantastic same with Stanly.  Seemed like a couple head over heels for each other.  I saw how the stories feed of each other.  Just Julie's story as so boring it depressed me.

Julie Powell tried something that was -- OK, interesting, but also pretty self-indulgent. And maybe if I hadn't read that her new book is a tell-all about her now-failed marriage, I would be less opinionated. But then again...

I wish Ephron, who is a terrific director, had chosen to make ""Julia Child in Paris"" and left Julie out of it. Meryl Streep and Stanley Tucci are just out of this world and I would have loved to have seen a movie just about Julia and Paul -- if you've ever read not only this book, but the several bios of Mrs. Child, you'd know there is enough material for four hours, let alone two.

With Julie's setting for example, I really didn't get the feeling of being in a run-down Brooklyn apartment over an ancient pizzeria (in an ancient neighborhood). Nor did I really feel the tension that supposedly led their marriage to a ""break"".

Then there was the portrayal of Child's life. In the book, her journey read like a crisp and inspiring retro breeze, and could've been portrayed with a lot more weight and artistry on the big screen.

It would've been nice to find out why Child was so upset with such a fan. But I did read one editorial in which the reviewer rants that Julie didn't view Child's book so much as inspiration for learning and appreciating the ""art of French cooking"" (and living), in which the philosophy seems to have more to do with taking things patiently so as savour life's pleasures and possibilities... but rather she was simply using the book as a personal finish line, in the more American vein of finding self-worth and adequacy through accomplishing specific tasks within a certain amount of time.

That reviewer's theory seemed to fit as an explanation, and with that in mind it probably isn't possible to give much weight to the movie, since the two women's stories really don't parallel at all... so then, coming back to my first point, it just becomes another heap of over-produced fluff, like Bewitched.",1261440000,6,1694,4.871527777777778

3975960,5,B002RSDW80,"Julie and Julia was such an entertaining movie (my husband loved it as well). Julie is a woman who is about to turn 30. She and her husband have just moved to a tiny, cramped apartment in Queens, NY above a pizza shop. She works full time at a just so so government job, and is unsure what to do with her life. Julie does love to eat, she loves to cook, so she comes up with an idea to cook every single recipe in Julia Child's Mastering the Art of French Cooking cookbook. She plans to do this all in one year and there are over 500 recipes. Every day she blogs about her cooking experience, and soon she becomes quite popular out there in cyberspace. She becomes totally obsessed with her project, and fortunately for her she has a supportive husband on her cheering squad.

If you see the movie, I think you will agree the Meryl Streep was just fabulous as Julia Child. She sounded just like her, and she too had a supportive husband like Julie, who encouraged her to pursue her interest in cooking, even though she was in her 40's when she did.

It was amazing how they combined Julie Powell's story with Julia Child's : My Life in Paris story. Laugh out loud moments you will want to experience again and again. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1261353600,,1236,4.346320346320346

The switching back and forth between the two and the switching back and forth in time frames didn't work well here. Was not humerous as I thought it would be. But my biggest complaint is the repeated reference/scenes regarding their sex life. No nudity, but I forgot how many times by the middle of the movie it showed both women and their husbands starting to have sex. Can we not have ANY movies anymore without sex?! It looks as if the movie industry has answered this question with a loud 'NO'!",1261267200,13,569,4.588235294117647
3975963,3,B002RSDW80,"I enjoyed this movie and really liked the part that focused on Julia and Paul Child in Paris.  The Julie Powell part wasn't as interesting to me, but then, I am older and have been watching Julia Child on PBS since I was a little girl.  Conversely, my 30 year old daughter seemed to fully identify with the modern New York part of the story, and so I guess my age has something to do with my greater interest in the older characters.

I love to cook and this movie inspired me to get Julia Child's book and try some of her techniques.  I actually boned a duck! :D  Although I am not ambitious enough to cook every recipe, I think it will enrich my own repertoire of dishes.  I am now looking for a video of Julia Child's PBS series and can't wait to try some of her recipes.

I gave it only three stars because of two issues:  (1) The Julia Powell part wasn't very interesting, and (2) the political commentary was trite and wearing.  Several of the reviewers were offended at the political slant of the movie.  I agree that there was some political bias and it got a little preachy, but I wasn't shocked.  I had already read Julia Child's biography and was aware that she and her husband were liberals who were at odds with Julia's super conservative parents.  Even though I didn't agree with the Childs' political views, I considered the movie to be accurate to the extent that the tension was real, and the incidents described actually did happen.  In addition, the author and screenwriter are liberals, so one must expect some of this type of thing to come through.  I just let it roll off my back and enjoyed the sweet love story of Julia and Paul Child; and of course, all the yummy food!",1261267200,3,1694,4.3706070287539935

The movie appealed to me on several levels. First, I did not know much at all about Julia Childs and the information relayed by the film whetted my curiosity to find out more. Streep is totally believable as Childs. Having seen only glimpses of her show, Streep obviously did a study of her and her mannerisms. Amy Adams as Julie portrays a newly 30ish woman searching for her identity through her year long blog where she cooks all of the recipes in Child's Mastering the Art of French Cooking.

The movie satisfies on several levels-as a biographical portrait, a comedy, a drama. Definitely worth seeing.",1261267200,,875,4.531645569620253
3975965,4,B002RSDW80,"I can boil water. My ""soul mate"" can boil water and, in addition, throw something into the pot. That, sadly, is the extent of our culinary acumen. That condition, nevertheless, does not preclude said ""soul mate"" from enthusiastically partaking in the recent mania for all things cookery. This last sentence is a round-about way of getting to the why of reviewing this recent film centered on a parallel presentation of the lives of a modern (maybe, post-modern, blog and all), alienated, middle class woman who gets caught up in a French cooking frenzy and the American post-World War II ""queen"" of that domain, the alienated, upper middle class woman, Julia Child.

Now it would be quite easy to sneer at the original premise of the plot- connecting the high-pitched old PBS icon Child with a ""thoroughly modern Millie"", Julie, in a fluffy, feel good piece of film about the travails of finding meaning in modern day life. Or to look askance at those old OSS (predecessor of the CIA) connections of old Julia and her husband, Paul. Or, more interestingly, the <em>noblesse oblige</em> premise of an intelligent woman with time on her hands behind her manic struggle to publish a book on fine French cooking for the average, servantless American housewife.

On most days I would be more than happy to throw some barbs that way. But here is the ""skinny"". This is just , in its own way, a funny look at a couple of slices of Americana. Beside that, who has time to be critical, in the above-mentioned ways, when you have to concentrate on watching Meryl Streep BE Julia Child. (Director Nora Ephron, apparently, just let Streep goes through her paces, thankfully). As always that actress turns in a sterling performance, no matter what the part. Moreover, if those are not good and sufficient reasons for taking a dive on this subject, please remember that ""soul mate"", who loved this film. I do not want to have to revive, in our household, the old tradition of having someone else taste my food before I eat it.",1261267200,,2011,4.759312320916905
3975966,4,B002RSDW80,"Nora Ephron has a gift for creating 'feel good films' that please a wide audience. Her works don't demand a lot from the viewer except a temporary suspension of reality to bask in her well-directed confections. JULIE & JULIA is not a great or important film, but it is a carefully meshed combination of cute story as portrayed by fine actors.

The indomitable Meryl Streep inhabits the very well known character Julia Child, not an easy assignment when the real Julia Child was observed by a very wide audience during the run of her television show on cooking. At first it seems as though Streep will be impersonating Child, but as is this actress' penchant for acting she soon becomes Child, not by imitating but instead by channeling the strangely funny and deliciously wild chef who captured the hearts of millions. Her part of this two-sided story shares the development of her gifts as a cook as well as her warmth with her friends and her husband (wonderfully played by Stanley Tucci) and that story alone is worth the price of admission.

The second side of the film is the story of a frustrated writer Julie (Amy Adams) who finds her joy in creating a blog to demonstrate that she can accomplish a goal: she will cook all recipes in Child's 'Mastering the Art of French Cooking' in 365 days. Adams does well with the script and balances the story of Child's successful search for her dream in Paris of the 1950s with a contemporary take on a mirror search via blogging in the 21st century. It works as a very pleasant diversion. This is a perfect film for holiday viewing: it comes with a huge dollop of love and light comedy. Grady Harp, December 09",1261180800,,1658,4.597972972972973
3975967,4,B002RSDW80,"JULIE AND JULIA is a film chronicling the lives of Julia Child (the famous author of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mastering-the-Art-of-French-Cooking/dp/0307593525/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mastering the Art of French Cooking</a>&nbsp;and Julie Powell, the New York-based author of a blog who challenges herself to cook her way through Julia's book (524 recipes) in one year (365 days). If you're a gourmet, a gourmand or just a mere trencherman you will appreciate this film.

Amy Adams is delightful as Julie, a young newlywed who is searching for a ""project"" to brighten her days (she works for a redeveloper at Ground Zero and deals with traumatized survivor families every day). She's warm and appealing and the kind of girl we all wish we had waiting at home. Adams' competent acting though, is as nothing to Meryl Streep who catches the essence of Julia Child---wife, would-be mother, and chef extraordinaire. Streep is well-matched with Stanley Tucci (as Paul Child, former OSS agent and career diplomat whose FDR Liberalism falls prey to McCarthyite paranoia). There's real affection between the Childs; Paul is dedicated to Julia and her burgeoning career as a professional chef/instructor/author.

Julia's happy home is is reflected in Julie's. Julie's husband Eric is about as loving as anybody can be in in the midst of what has become a near-obsession. He helps her boil lobsters (to the Talking Heads' accompaniment of ""Psycho Killer). Not that they don't fight, but even their 24 hour separation has no impact on how endearing the characters are. Likewise, Julia and Paul Child are simply embraceable (even though neither of them can approach the Julie/Eric cutesy factor). So much is in the casting.

3975970,3,B002RSDW80,"This movie is a sad disappointment. In case you haven't heard (and if you are reading this review at all, you probably have heard), it's based on Julia Child's memoir ""My Life in France"" and Julie Powell's blog and book about making the 524 recipes in ""Mastering the Art of French Cooking"" over the course of a year.

I gave it three stars because:
1. of Meryl Streep's delightful incarnation of the late, great Julia Child
2. you can't go wrong filming in Paris
3. it was reasonably engaging for me--but I'm a francophile foodie and Julia's ""French Chef"" show on PBS in the 1960s changed my Anglo-Irish meat and potatoes culinary world forever
4. when Julia receives a letter from a prospective publisher at her home in Cambridge, Mass., circa 1960, the filmmakers show the envelope with a two-digit postal code rather than a ZIP code
5. they include Dan Ackroyd's Julia Child skit from Saturday Night Live
6. it reminds me not to crowd the mushrooms.

Now the weaknesses:
1. The Julie Powell character (well-played by Amy Adams) is self-absorbed and tedious and you wonder why her husband loves her; heck, you're not even sure why the cat hangs around
2. The Paul Child character is underdeveloped and although you see that Julia loves him dearly, you can't figure out quite why
3. It does not have enough drama for a drama, and it does not have enough jokes for a comedy
4. They don' show the clip of Julia taking a blowtorch to creme brulee on Letterman
5. How can a story about such a larger-than-life person feel so Cinderella-story-formulaic and pedestrian?

For a movie about haute cuisine, it leaves me feeling about as satisfied as a trip through the Burger King drive-up window. Still, if even one person who sees ""Julie & Julia"" recycles Rachael Ray and buys, studies, and gets the courage to start cooking with ""Mastering the Art . . . "" instead, it will have been worth it. On a rainy weekend when you've got time, butter and sugar on hand to survive a few mistakes, try the tarte tatin.

As other reviewers mentioned, I found myself becoming more and more impatient to get back to the Julia storyline -- so much so, that I began to fast-forward through the Julie parts.  I do understand the need to edit down the vast number of scenes in the book (or we would end up with a movie 10 hours long), but Julie Powell deserved so much more -- this film is not a fair representation of who she is, by a long shot.  It was as if all of the creative energy was funnelled into the Julia scenes, and Julie Powell was simply an afterthought.

The two stories nicely blend together and although I was drawn to the Meryl Streep/Stanley Tucci side of the movie, often almost groaning aloud when switching back to the Amy Adams/Chris Messina pairing, somewhere around the mid-point I stopped wrestling with which side was more absorbing and just started enjoying the ebb and flow of the two stories.

I think this is Nora Ephron's most skilful and graceful directing, to date. And, the end result shows her maturity and talent for storytelling, and knowing what the audience wants to see -- something often devalued as irrelevant in the quest for artistic expression or big box office tallies.

My knowledge of Julia Child is limited to her wonderful television cooking series and the cookbook which is the subject of this movie. How delightful to learn that she had a very loving marriage and quite an interesting life. In that regard, the movie was a revelation and sparked an interest to learn more about Child.  The story of Julie and her husband, although less engrossing was still entertaining, and both actors held their own remarkably well against the superb veterans Streep and Tucci.  It is also a pleasure to have two male characters portray loving supportive husbands rather than cads, womanizers, selfish stupid oafs or brutes.  These men had backbone, and heart.

I disagree with the criticism that Streep is doing a cartoonish impression of Julia Child. For someone who has watched almost every episode of Child's cooking show, her voice and mannerisms were cartoonish - that's the reality.  If Streep had not attempted to replicate her very distinct cadence and gestures the audience would have felt something essential was missing. While watching Streep's performance in Julie and Julia, I forgot about the actress and focused on the character she was playing. For me that is an indication that Streep succeeded in her portrayal.

Amy Adams was also very good as the down-trodden NYC worker that worshipped Julia. Julie's blog fans, inturn, made her writing a hit as well.

Meryl Streep does a wonderful job portraying Julia Child and showing a side of her personality most people would likely not know to have existed.  My mother told me when she watched her on TV she didn't show personality like she did on this movie.  Learning about how she came into cooking, later in her life & after her marriage, gave a new perspective on her cooking style and her famous french cookbooks (which I just ordered the hardcover set due to my desire to replicate many of delicious cuisines shown in the film).  I have to say true french restaurants & cuisine is hard to find where I live, so I can't say I have longed for it or known how to make it -- but now I can't wait to try it out.

In truth, the movie is mostly about Julie, played by Amy Adams, who plays an average American woman who hates her job and lives in a less-than-desirable apartment with her husband over a pizza place.  Amy Adams portrayal of Julie makes her annoying and aggravating at times, but for the most part an adventurous character wanting to figure out how to give her life meaning.  Julie's relationship with her husband is sometimes very similar to Julia Child's relationship with her husband; however, throughout the film there is a significant difference between their relationship likely related to the difference in age, experience, and ultimately what the movie is about - Julie's need to define herself and figure out how to change her life.

I think this film was great for entertainment, good for those who love to look at food, fun for friends and family, but also very re-watchable -- something I always value in a movie.  If on the fence of watching it, at least rent it as I have fond memories of it already and enjoyed sharing the experience with my mom.",1260662400,2,1999,4.497237569060774

The acting is quite good.  Meryl Streep seems to be an enormously talented chameleon in her acting - she seems taller in the film, probably with lifts, but has the tall woman's physical movement down pat as the ungainly Julia Child.  Stanley Tucci is usually very good.  Amy Adams plays the vulnerable young woman who works at a 9/11 Recovery center.  Here's where her boss says, ""Hey I'd fire you if I was a Republican but I'm not a schmuck.""  There are also reference to McCarthy and Julia's father voting as a Republican to set the Left-wing agenda in motion.  Gratuitious bashing distracts from otherwise good entertainment.

3975983,3,B002RSDW80,"there are few indicators, more clear and concise, than this movie as a denominator of the disgrace of contemporary treacle being published as ""writing."" meryl streep as julia child is a effervescent reminder of how people used to be: made of strong stuff, clear views, and dedicated to accomplishment...a point made clear by one scene in the movie (will get to that in a moment). meryl streep simply must be given a place of her own in the arena of movies. how great thou art meryl streep? very great, indeed. had hollyweird truly wanted to make a great movie they would simply have made the story of julia child and left amy adams/julie powell in the dustbin where she belongs.

the portions of the movie with amy adams are insufferable, showing as they do, the insufferableness of new yorkers who, steeped in the history of it's-all-about-me psychoanalysis and woody allen belly-button analysis disguised as thought, believe that new yorkers, who have no experiences save for hailing cabs and shopping at bloomies, can nonetheless pretend to write books/movies on experience sieved through the life of those who actually have lived a life: to wit, julia child. new yorkers are shallow, intellectually bereft, and clearly in need of some good ole hands-on living. every new yorkers is seemingly afflicted with michelle oboma syndrome (entitled to the movie star life because they breath air and can walk and talk at the same time). julie powell is the classic insufferable new yorker whose vapidity knows no bounds but the new york publishing world awards this kind of vapidity, refusing to recognize it as a form of sucker fish living whereby ones only ability is to exploit those who have done and lived and achieved.

oh and that scene which shows just how insufferable new yorkers are? in the movie, amy adams/julie powell is oh-so-hurt that julia child doesn't come running to her acclaiming them best buds, but rather declaims amy adams/julie powell in the crisp concise way of ms. child's wielding of her meat cleaver. and why not? the movie clearly shows the endeavor of years julia child racked up in learning her craft and honing her recipes, and amy adams/julie powell wish to simply exploit her. ms. child being no fool, doesn't appreciate such exploitation. new york publishing has no shame.

please, begging here really. stop the onslaught of books by insufferably self-annointing new york ""authors"". julie powell has, as is so common these days, been annointed with a book contract on the basis of sixth grade writing and an ability to serve up treacle as nutrition, which much like a twinkie simply can't sustain for more than a wee bit (not to malign the venerable twinkie which compared to julie powell is a medieval feast).

3975988,3,B002RSDW80,"This 2009 dramedy is an uneven case of dramatic bifurcation tied tenuously together by two characters who share a struggle to find their livelihoods through their passions. One is Julia Child, the larger-than-life culinary legend who found her calling when her adoring husband Paul, a U.S. Foreign Service envoy, is transferred to Paris in 1947. The other is her acolyte, Julie Powell, a bored call center worker for the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation in the throes of 9/11, who also happens to be a failed novelist with a supportive husband in Queens.

The central problem is that Childs' story is emotionally rich and more compelling, while Powell's comparatively trivial account is the one that provides the narrative framework.

In Paris, Child instantly becomes a Francophile, and forces her way into the prestigious Le Cordon Bleu to take professional-level cooking lessons where she perseveres among her disapproving male colleagues. Finding her passion there, Child partners with French epicureans Simone Beck and Louisette Bertholle to collaborate first on a cooking school for American expatriates and then on a massive cookbook currently in its 49th printing,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mastering-the-Art-of-French-Cooking/dp/0307593525/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mastering the Art of French Cooking</a>&nbsp;published in 1961.

Flash forward four decades to 2002, Powell, tired of her mundane job, takes her cue from Child's 524-recipe book and decides to write a personal blog documenting her attempt to cook every recipe in the book within one year.  Child becomes Powell's muse, and her entertaining posts attract quite a fan base.

However, her increasing self-absorption and cooking temperament start to make her marriage unravel. The two stories never really coalesce but just trail off in their separate ways. Nailing Child's braying tone and gawky manner, Meryl Streep is masterfully entertaining as usual, although there is a Looney Tunes-level edge to her mostly comic performance. She certainly evokes the memory of the real Julia, but there's also a surprising bit of parody that seems intended. Adams, Streep's co-star in last year's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Doubt/dp/B001PA0FFO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Doubt</a>, is an engaging presence, but Julie is basically an insufferable, narcissistic character that needs an actress with a more natural edginess. It takes a considerable effort for Adams to overcome Streep's shadow to hold up her part of the story, but the basic inequity in the storylines is never truly resolved. Stanley Tucci, who played Streep's devoted associate in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Devil-Wears-Prada/dp/B000J103PC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Devil Wears Prada</a>, provides a blessedly low-key presence as Paul, but Chris Messina (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Vicky-Cristina-Barcelona/dp/B001DJ7PR8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Vicky Cristina Barcelona</a>) is merely bland as Powell's non-descript husband Eric.

In near-cameos, Mary Lynn Rajskub (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/24/dp/B001L5SRJE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">24</a>) provides needed snap in Powell's half, and once again, Jane Lynch, nearly unrecognizable in period clothing, steals scenes, this time from the formidable Streep, as Child's unapologetically high-flying sister Dorothy. The movie feels overlong at 124 minutes probably because neither story invokes that much in the way of surprise or conflict. Everything works out the way you would expect with one notable exception at the end. The 2009 DVD offers a couple of extras. One is the inevitable commentary track, which only includes Ephron explaining the details of the production, and without the participation of the cast principals, there are long periods where she says nothing. The second is a half-hour featurette, ""Special Ingredients: Creating Julie & Julia"", a better-than-average making-of piece.",1260489600,5,5317,7.4483306836248016

The scenes between Streep and Stanley Tucci (as Julia's supportive diplomat husband) are nothing short of sublime. However, melding Child's ""My Life in France"" with Julie Powell's 2005 memoir proves problematic. Despite writer-director Nora Ephron's best intentions, the parallel stories never dovetail into a satisfying finale. The likable Amy Adams offers a strangely unlikable portrayal of the blogger cook - a directorial misstep on Ephron's part. Chris Messina, by contrast, is thoroughly appealing as Julie's devoted spouse. In retrospect, a Julia Child biopic would have been far more effective.

If you're a fan of Julia Child, then go directly to the source and spend your hard earned money on her product.  The US media gave way too much attention to someone who is a narcissistic bloodsucking opportunist.  Then again, in these troubled times, there's nothing better than diverting the public's attention by panem et circenses.  What is very disturbing is that not only did someone, who cooked Julia Child's recipes as millions of women have done for decades, and scammed sick days with pay from the government via the taxpayer while doing so, (No wonder our country is in such financial disorder with government workers doing this and their bosses allowing them to do so!) but she blogged about it with foul language and Julia Child herself did not approve of Mrs. Powell.  And yet, this woman was given massive media attention for simply cooking recipes and blogging in a disrespectful manner.  Simply amazing!  Then again, that's the US media!

Not only is this woman offered media attention and massive deals by the media, she is now selling a book about Julia Child and herself, very egotistical to think we even care about her.  And really, we don't.  She is no one except another scammer.  While alive, Julia Child obviously recognized this.  Julia Child worked many years to accomplish what she did, and a year after she dies; this opportunist publishes a book about herself linking herself to Julia Child.  Even the title stinks of self-importance:  Julie and Julia not Julia and Julie.  Just who is the famous person here who worked many, many years?!  Certainly not the unstable Julie who is first depicted in the title?!  That takes extreme nerve since Mrs. Powell has admittedly not completed anything in her life and should have even been fired from her job and also because Mrs. Child herself was not pleased with Mrs. Powell's bloodsucking opportunistic venture!

And if Mrs. Child was alive, would she have sued Mrs. Powell or the book publisher for doing so?  It's no coincidence the book was published one year after Mrs. Child's death, and I must stress once again Mrs. Child did not approve of Mrs. Powell or her endeavors.  I wonder if the estate has delved into this matter at all.  In fact, the estate should really check into plagiarism since Mrs. Powell no doubt had to take information directly from Mrs. Child's book and biography in order to create her writing of Mrs. Child's life.  And this obviously was not done with Mrs. Child's assistance or approval.  The publisher should have reprinted Mrs. Child's own work rather than giving another bloodsucker an opportunity to exploit someone else's hard work, and the director should have also not taken the easy way out, and she should have created her screenplay from Mrs. Child's own memoirs keeping Ms. Streep to play the starring role.

STARRING: Meryl Streep, Amy Adams, Stanley Tucci, Chris Messina, Jane Lynch and Mary Lynn Rajskub

WRITTEN BY: Nora Ephron; based on the books: Julie & Julia by Julie Powell; My Life in France by Julia Child and Alex Prud'homme

DIRECTED BY: Nora Ephron

Rated: PG-13
Genre: Comedy / Drama
Release Date: 07 August 2009

Do not, I repeat, do not see this film on an empty stomach! No movie has made me this hungry since Ratatouille. It is filled with the most scrumptious foods one could imagine; everything from a zesty beef stew to a raspberry cream desert. This film was delicious!

Although, to call it a film doesn't quite give it the justice it deserves. It's essentially two films in one.

Half the film we spend with the legendary Chef Julia Child (Meryl Streep). I am a little rusty on my culinary history I'm afraid, as I had never heard of her. However, I don't have to be familiar with her at all to know that Meryl Streep has nailed, yet another outstanding performance and could very well find herself nominated for an Academy Award for the 16th time. Streep is hilarious, warm-hearted and you can't help but love her in this film.

She is married to Paul Child (Stanley Tucci) who is the bread-winner while she begins taking cooking classes. Soon enough she is one of the top students and is cooking up a storm. We follow her over a span of several years in the 1940s in France, as she takes all of her marvelous recipes and inserts them into her masterpiece: Mastering the Art of French Cooking.

It's no easy feat to get it published though. She runs into several obstacles along the way, keeping us guessing. Eventually it is a huge success and she is given her very own cooking show.

Fast forward to 2002 and we have the second story taking place in Queens, New York. Julie Powell (Amy Adams) is bored with her simple life and wants to do something about it. She decides to take Julia's book containing 524 scrumptious recipes, and generate a blog of her adventures cooking every recipe in just 365 days. She too has her ups and downs with juggling the blog, her long hour day job and her marriage to a man whose patience for her obsession is wearing thin, and understandably so.

From there we jump back and forth from the past to the present (2002), showing each woman's journey to success through cooking and writing.

From Julia's magnificent kitchen and homes, to Julie's adorable, cozy little apartment atop of a Pizzeria; the film is packed with beautiful sets and spectacular costumes. So much detail went into every aspect in the backgrounds of all the scenes. I have costume design and set design pegged for Oscar nominations.

The acting is outstanding. Nora Ephron as always, gets amazing performances out of all of her actors. Adams could see a third Oscar nomination for herself. And may I ask why Hollywood doesn't put Stanley Tucci in more films? The man is incredible. I especially liked the guy playing Julie's husband, Eric (Chris Messina). I had seen him in a few films but not much, and he blew me away. He and Adams had great chemistry together. Jane Lynch surprised me as well. It took me a minute to even realize it was her.

And of course there is the wonderful Meryl Streep. While watching this film I realized more than ever how talented she is. Watch how much emotion she conveys with just her eyes. If you take into consideration the fact that Streep knows exactly what her co-stars are going to say because they have rehearsed and rehearsed it God knows how many times; you will me amazed at how she makes you believe that she has heard this new information for the very first time. It never feels like she's acting; it just feels like she is.

The film is a perfect blend of comedy and drama. It's not a mushy film by any means but on three different occasions I found myself with a little tear in my eye. I find it's more the uplifting successful accomplishments of people that get to me more so than devastation and this film has several little moments like that.

Nora Ephron is an amazing writer and director and has made another beautiful film. The only thing keeping Julie & Julia from being absolutely perfect was I simply wanted a little bit more of it. I don't think that's necessarily a bad thing.",1260403200,,4272,4.55019556714472
3975994,4,B002RSDW80,"The review is for the Blu-ray release.  Just an FYI that the Blu-ray release has more exclusive features over its DVD counterpart.

VIDEO & AUDIO:

""Julie & Julia"" is featured in 1080p High Definition (1:85:1) and features beautiful cinematography from Stephen Goldblatt (""Charlie Wilson's War"", ""Rent"", ""Conspiracy"", ""Angels in America"").  For Julia Child's story, we see the shots in Paris, late 40's and early 1950's.  Set design and costume design were well done but it was important for Goldblatt to capture that feel of Paris but most importantly the decor of that time.  It's important to note that in the special features, it is mentioned several times that the look of Julia's life in the past, is how Julie Powell imagined Julia's life, so it's a characterization of Julia and Paul Child.

For Julie's story, this is a couple who lives atop a pizzeria and for the most part, are not making a whole lot of money.  The timing of Julie's storyline is months after 9/11 and but where Julia Child's features the somewhat upper middle-class living, Julie's life in a 900 sq. ft. room, small kitchen and just the surroundings of Julie and Eric's life is captured well.

Detail of both lifestyles are well-captured in film, shots of the food are colorful, blacks are nice and deep, skin tones are natural but it's the various shots that stay in your mind.  From Julie and friends sitting above the rooftops overlooking the NYC skyline and Julia and friends eating at a cafe or restaurant.  But both different timelines are well-captured and presented amazing well in the film.

As for audio, ""Julie & Julia"" is presented in English 5.1 DTS-HD MA (And French and English - audio description track 5.1 Dolby Digital).  The film is primarily dialogue driven and is front and center channel driven where you will hear music being played  Audio description is pretty much just that, a female voice describes what is happening during each scene while the normal audio of the film is playing.

Subtitles are in English SDH, Spanish, Cantonese, Mandarin and Portuguese.

JUDGMENT CALL:

Adorable, entertaining and delightful!  ""Julia & Julie"" once again shows us once again why Meryl Streep and Amy Adams are wonderful actresses.

Although not working together like they were in the film ""Doubt"", both actresses were both wonderful in their roles.  Meryl Streep as Julia Child is very convincing but what I found quite wonderful is seeing a side of Julia Child that I was not even familiar with.  One thing in my household is that my wife enjoys watching her old programs on PBS, so we watched this film together and she was quite impressed.  For me, I was more impressed about the relationship between her and husband Paul and seeing how she became passionate about food and even treated badly when she entered Le Corden Bleu. Stanley Tucci brings that side of Paul Child that many people are not familiar with and it was great to learn from friends and family of how well he played the part.

I was surprised because I thought after seeing her in PBS for all these years, I thought she was a chef previous to hosting her own cooking show.  So, it was great to know this personal side of Julia Child and if anything, watching this part of the film encourages me to purchase the book ""My Life in France"".

As for Julie Powell storyline, Amy Adams does a wonderful job playing this wife who works at a job and is just not feeling her life is all that exciting (when compared to her other friends) and thus setting a goal for herself by cooking all the recipes from ""Mastering the Art of French Cooking"" and blogging about it.

I suppose for today's social media crowd, a film about blogging and use of Paypal is something that today's viewers can definitely connect with.  As with Nora Ephron's ""You've Got Mail"" using the Internet technology of e-mail for her romantic film, it was great to see Ephron doing a film about blogging.

What I found was quite amusing is seeing how many people have responded to Powell's blog.  After watching the movie, I definitely had to check this blog out and after reading the comments written (around the time she made her first post), I realized that Powell touched and inspired hundreds of people to do something similar.  I've known so many people who have blogged about cooking and even I have blogged about the food and recipes that I've cooked over the years.  So, the fact that Powell was able to write a book about her blog and an adaptation made for film is wonderful (note: The last time I have seen this happen was for the Korean film ""My Sassy Girl"").

As for the Blu-ray release, Sony Pictures Home Entertainment really went all out in making sure the release contains plenty of special features.  In fact, the commentary and ""Secret Ingredients"" feature is on the DVD release but everything else is exclusive only for the Blu-ray release.  Definitely a good way to drive people to upgrade to Blu-ray.

Overall, ""Julie & Julia"" is an entertaining and heartwarming film featuring strong performances from its talent, also well done cinematography.  ""Julie & Julia"" may be a film about two different stories but it was great learning about Julia and Paul Child's personal life in France and what led to Julia Child being the International star.  And of course, watching how a blogger would inspire man people through her action of cooking every recipe from Julia Child's book.

A wonderful Blu-ray release and may you be Julia Child or Julie Powell fans, bloggers, people who love to cook or you are wanting an entertaining movie, ""Julie & Julia"" is definitely recommended!",1260316800,4,8439,4.936879432624114

She is working as a secretary in a government office that is dealing with many of the issues around ground zero. It is a thankless stressful position and she has a minor ability to help the people who call.
She goes home to her husband in a small apartment over a pizzeria and to wind down from her frustrations, she cooks some amazing meals. Feeling like she is wasting her life and her talents, she creates a challenge for herself.  Cook all of the recipes in Julia Child's; Mastering the Art of French Cooking in one year and blog about it.

THE FOUNDATION STORY LINE: JULIA
Simultaneously in the movie, you are treated; with story of the evolution of Julia Child's famous book and how it came about with Julia Child and her French collaborators.  Independent of the story line, what really struck me was the technology differences and how I had forgetten how different things were so not long ago. Julia's 1950 era of Air Mail and Telegraphs to Julie's Email, Blog and texts. What we are reminded of too, is how formidable and impenetrable French Cuisine and the Cordon Bleu was then, not only to just American's but an American Woman, no less. Bravo Julia!  The times were also tense with McCarthy era politics.  Julia's husband's job forced several unwanted moves in the midst of the book creation. All this combined made it even more amazing that it came together.

THE MESSAGE:
This movie reminds you how much a trailblazer Julia Child was. This statuesque woman with the falsetto voice changed the way America cooked in an era of Fluffernutters. This also stands to show you that, if you pursue something you love, as both Julie and Julia did, you will find the perseverance to see it though during the rough spots. Mind you, a supportive spouse also helps..

The actors were perfect for these roles and as usual Meryl Streep delivers..

Bravo Julie and Julia.",1260230400,2,2093,4.619946091644205

Meryl Streep is an awesome actress.  Her impersonation of Julia Child may even be Oscar-calibre.  She nailed the voice and the mannerisms of Julia.  If one didn't know it was a movie, you would swear you were listening to the real Julia Child.  Amy Adams also turned in a fine supporting role.  When she succeeded you felt her joy, when she failed you felt her pain.

At times the movie dragged a bit, I think a little too much time was given to cover Julia's book efforts, but overall effort is well worth the time spent.  I appreciate the film's originality in that it really can't be made into a sequel.  It is what it is, a stand alone film based on two true stories.  It really should be considered for Academy Award nominations.",1260144000,2,986,4.27027027027027
3975999,5,B002RSDW80,"A wonderful film and another obviously stellar performance by Meryl Streep. Once again I will skip the plot dissection as I figure most are reading this to know about the Blu - short summary before the text: totally worth it.

The Blu quality is beautiful, as is the DTS clarity. The interior colors looked finite, even during the somewhat muted/lack of palette scenes with Streep. The languages are English and French only, and I have heard better audio description tracks, but it sufficed. Even if you were to rate the film lower, the supplements are outstanding.

* 27:45 minute making-of. A fluffy how-great-everyone-is feature, but still worth the time because it shows some funny moments behind the camera.
* 47:39 minute family & friends remembering everything Julia. A great piece, almost worth watching by itself if you skip everything else; true fans of hers will want this for the home collection.
* 22:26 Julia's Kitchen. The process behind getting her kitchen into the Smithsonian. If the dry behind-the-scenes of museum stuff does not appeal to you then skip this one - but I loved it, especially when the interviewees describe Julia's reaction to seeing the final product before her at the Smithsonian.
* Cooking of Julia, 5 clips totaling 22 minutes. Each topic shows a brief clip from the film of what dish was being made followed by a clip of either Julia or a famous chef who worked with her detailing how the viewer can make it. They show the poached eggs, hollendaise sauce (both with Julia and Pepin from his show - she was classic even in those brief clips), scramble eggs, the braised beef ribs dish and lobster. When I played these clips in the store, customers loved watching how easy it was to make the great dishes from the film (because apparently almost everyone has seen this film - and liked it).
* Commentary with Ephron. She is a very articulate and professional woman and I know fans of hers will enjoy what she has to say - even if it gets heavy on how phenomenal Streep is, which how can you argue otherwise?
* movieIQ. You get the usual spattering of material familiar to this program plus actual recipes can be accessed.

3976000,2,B002RSDW80,"I was in the movie theater with eight friends, enoying this movie, when Julia Child's parents were introduced. They were depicted as horrible, conservative, California Republicans. The actors turned their parts into cardboard characters -- no depth, no complexity. The movie dismissed them as a joke. Later in the movie, more disparaging remarks are made about Republicans by Julie's boss. These scenes reflect much of the current need by Hollywood to denegrate anything conservative.

The worst part of the film, however, was the point where Julia Child's husband utters a gutter curse word. It was so jarring. There was absolutely no need for him to do that. He could have said something else and still made his point. It was a ""shock"" point which immediately took me out of the film. I suddenly saw two actors, not Julia and her husband. There are so few films these days without explicit sex, violence and/or profanity. While the movie had some tender and even funny moments, they were ruined by the director's choice to use offensive language and to put down certain groups.

Every time she appears on screen, the film just glows. She is amazing and you will smile every time you see Julia on screen. The only thing that might upstage Meryl is the food being cooked. I had eaten dinner before I went but was actually salivating several times during the movie. Julia Child made French food accessible and you will want to eat -- a lot afterward. Everyone was laughing a lot -- sometimes on top of lines being said, which made us miss the next few lines. This is NOT a chick flick -- I highly recommend this for people 14 and older (younger kids will probably be bored ---- silly younger kids!). I am just amazed at Meryl Streep! She's a true talent.

3976003,3,B002RSDW80,"2009 has been a tough year for a film-goer like me.  i am drawn most strongly to character-driven films such as last year's 'the reader' or 'frozen river' or to film biographies that meticulously researched and star-driven with that type of performance that is likewise so researched, yet so nuanced that a viewer can feel he or she is seeing the personality. right there. no frills. in the recent past, jamie foxx and cate blanchett more than fulfilled my needs with their interpretations of ray charles and katharine hepburn. now meryl streep has done the same in this year's 'julie and julia'. her work is standing alone, though there have been and will be the requisite numbers of film biographies for 2009.

words cannot describe streep's performance but i am going to give it a shot. streep is a zesty, tangible delight as world-famous chef julia child. and i am going to stop there because i cannot go any further without mentioning stanley tucci as child's husband paul or jane lynch as child's garrulous sister dorothy.  both offer solid support; i hope tucci's work will get its reward when awards fest begins.

these three actors made such a strong impact on me as an audience member that i found myself getting a little testy waiting for them to come back on screen. child's career beginning as a chef runs parallel to the story of julie powell, played charmingly by amy adams.  powell, an overworked city employee, is encouraged to start a blog by her husband eric played by chris messina. so, her blog becomes her day-by-day working through child's first cook book.  although her story is an inspiring one, it is not as interesting as child's. and adams and messina are too cute to be believed, even as they squabble. julia and paul's life is portrayed as largely idyllic and you think that would be the boring one. but it isn't.

KLM offers dozens of films on its trans-Atlantic flights, but most of them are Harry Potter I-VI or GI Joe Cobra in various combinations of language and subtitles. Thus it happens that I felt rather benign about this rather flimsy concoction of a film. I was hoping for a strongly-spiced ""food movie"" on a par with Stanley Tucci's 'The Big Night'. Tucci plays a long in 'Julie and Julia' but his part is as bland as the mixed vegetables in a steakhouse. Julie and Julia is NOT a food movie; it's a sentimental feel-good marriage-crisis movie about Julie, interspersed with a Saturday Night Live spoof of Julia Child.

Meryl Streep is killingly funny as Julia Child, but her performance is pure parody. There's no story to it - not that a story is required - and there's precious little 'food' for thought. A minor surprise is delivered when, at the end of the film, a phone caller tells Julie that Julia doesn't entirely thrill to her fingertips at being exploited for her fame. That surprise remains unexamined.

The real story is Julie's, about Julie, and ""it's all about Julie"" in Julie's world. I suspect a generation gap appears in my reaction to sweet little Julie and her navel-gazing blog-to-fame. I found her to be an annoying twit. I would have felt quite sorry for hunky hubby, except that he had no personality to feel sorry for. The two tales here - of Julie's marriage and of Julia's education of French cooking - are shuffled together with a minimum of cinematic artistry.

3976007,2,B002RSDW80,"This is a curious film. It is in two parts presents in an overlapping function. One is a drawn out going nowhere account of Julia Childs many years of writing a 700 page cookery book, the other is about Julie Powell (contemporary, and about whom they said, ""Who?"") Julie is surprised to find she is a writer and is respected for the quality of her blog about copying Julia Childs's recipes.

Meryl Streep plays Julia Childs as if she is continually drunk or on the happy pills. What is it? A local accent, or was JC continually drunk or on the happy pills? Does one have to be American to understand such a strange way of speaking? Are there people in the US who actually speak like that?

The film is long and seems to be going nowhere, and the impression is that someone made a film about Julia Childs, realized it was dull, drawn out, and boring, and decided to add something novel to rescue a botched effort. The fact that someone became obsessed with re-creating Julia Childs's recipes over a whole year and write about her experiences in an internet blog seems to have been a story that has been cobbled on to salvage something from the efforts.

Julia Childs did not realize how unrealistic and unworldly she was, or how unscrupulous she was with her French collaborators, and Julie Powell was equally unworldly and did not realize that she was a good writer.

And Ms. Streep pulls it off with a performance so good it was like Julia Child breathed again in all of her good-hearted, iconoclastic glory.

Honestly, overall, I did not care for the film too much, and I could have cared less for the other actors in the film. That's just my opinion, and other reviewers have written about them in glowing terms, so perhaps I missed the bus somewhere and may have to rethink that position one day. Also, there have been some serious complaints that the Master Chef (I am unsure of the formal title) of the Cordon Bleu was depicted in a way that made her look like a far more snobbish and dreadful person than she actually was.  Nevertheless, it is absolutely worth it just to watch the scenes with Ms. Streep.  It's one of her best performances yet, and that's saying something.  She takes a so-so movie and a so-so script and makes them sparkle as the legendary gourmet who tried to make everyone's life a little happier through those most basic and delicious media - good, hearty unpretentious food, good company, and good cheer.  Just an amazing performance, and were she alive, I will just bet Julia Child would have been the first one on her feet cheering and clapping.

Other than the love of food, oodles of butter and a big project to fill the need for purpose, the two main characters in Nora Ephron's biopic, ""Julie and Julia"" share great marriages with men that are not put off by their mate's desire for self-identity defined by more than a few little bouts of self-absorption. Like a good souffl, Ephron folds the stories told in two books, Powell's ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Julie-and-Julia-My-Year-of-Cooking-Dangerously/dp/031604251X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Julie and Julia: My Year of Cooking Dangerously</a>"" and Child's ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/My-Life-in-France-Movie-Tie-In-Edition-Random-House-Movie-Tie-In-Books/dp/0307474852/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">My Life in France (Movie Tie-In Edition) (Random House Movie Tie-In Books)</a>"" without deflating the overall mixture, although this reviewer would have enjoyed more scenes with the wonderfully talented Meryl Streep who redeems herself quite well (all high-pitched voice, champagne bubbly laughter and squared shoulders) as the indomitable and effusive Julia from her most un-defining role as Donna in that ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mamma-Mia-The-Movie-Widescreen/dp/B001GKJ2DY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mamma Mia! The Movie (Widescreen)</a>"" debacle.

Ephron depicts 1950s Paris with a foodie's appreciation for what that city did and still does for the world of cuisine--from the very first glimpse of Julia's luncheon of sole meunire--the waiter delectably filets the fish's sumptuous flesh tableside to the audiences' very audible groans of anticipation of and appreciation for its buttery taste, but she also does well by Long Island City and its tangle of grey-tinged tenements, elevated trains and apartments over pizza parlors. Somehow, both Julie and Julia know where to get their ingredients and manage beat, chop (extremely amusing is a scene of Julia alongside a mountain of practice cut onions) and coerce calf's feet, lobsters and ducks into exquisite works of edible art. The luscious chocolate cakes, whipped creams and raspberry mousse tantalizes like the food porn that it is--a sensual and lascivious reminder to what is truly important in life--you will leave the theater hungry.

Along that line, the two couples, Paul (Stanley Tucci) and Julia and Eric (Chris Messina) and Julie either act as the aphrodisiacs for the food or allow the food to whisk them away in the general direction of the bedroom where dessert or in some cases appetizers segue into the joy of sex and more sex--no wonder Julia was always smiling. Both male characters offer their women encouragement along the lines of the supporting architectural buttresses on the Cathedral of Notre Dame even when faced by what may seem a bit of an ""I Love Lucy"" type scheme. Regardless, both these ladies made their ideas work whether by design or serendipity and Ephron, wisely asserts that it is their good marriages that deserve the credit--even though the real life Powell has an affair which she chronicles in her not-yet-published memoir about learning the art of the butcher.

Amy Adams' portrayal of Julie Powell seems a little seeped in too much sugar especially if one has read the Julie/Julia Project blog or the book that bears the same name as the film. In her version, Ephron sanitizes the conservative-hating Powell, cleans up her apartment, washes out her rather profane mouth and thankfully eliminates the girlfriend dramas that take up a third of the memoir. However, the slim-figured Adams' whose character claims to have gained weight after a year of rich French cuisine simply seems slim and still glows with that Giselle insouciance and naivet she did so well in the Disney film ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Enchanted/dp/B000R4GF9Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Enchanted</a>."" Even so, Adams' innate cuteness and 20-something sense of searching works adequately as a foil for the larger than life Streep as the formidable Child.

Bottom Line? Nora Ephron's ""Julie and Julia"" chronicles the projects of two women from two very different generations with similar needs. As a combination foodie/chick flick, it works very well in its depiction of determination and the power of a slow and steady perseverance that ultimately leads to success. However, ""Julie and Julia"" main thrust seems to be a tribute to good marriages where behind every great women stands an equally great and supportive male. Recommended.

3976012,5,B002RSDW80,"I loved this film, which is surprising given two things. First, I am not a food guy. I don't appreciate gourmet cooking and I can't cook anything that doesn't involve a microwave. I don't really enjoy going to restaurants and I would rather watch bowling or golf (two sports that I loathe) than any cooking show. Food plays less of a role in my life than it does for most people. Oddly enough, however, I have seen an unusually large amount of Julia Child. My ex-wife was a devoted viewer of Julia's show so her voice is emblazoned onto my brain in an indelible way. Second, I'm not a fan of Meryl Streep. I make no defense of this. She simply rubs me the wrong way. The most I can say in making a case against her is that I'm always aware of her ""acting."" I find her deliberate and self-conscious and always ""plying her craft."" I was delighted when I heard Katherine Hepburn make the same claim. There is no doubting her talent, but for me I'm always conscious of her as an actress assuming a role, instead of becoming the role. I will not argue against anyone who believes that she is the greatest actress of her age. This is about me and my reaction to her. And it is a positive one. So, the film had these two large marks against it from my perspective, so when I say that I loved the movie, it had a fair amount to overcome.

So why did I enjoy this film so much, despite my built in biases? Because both the stories in the film - that of Julia Childs and Julie Power - were about everyday people deciding to do something that no one expected them to do. Julia Child undertaking French cooking more as a hobby, a pleasant way of passing the time, or Julie Powell writing her own blog detailing her cooking all of the recipes in the book that grew out of Julia's book. There is no difference between Julia learning to cook or Julie writing a blog and any of us - me, you, her, or him - undertaking a self-empowering project. (This resonated very strongly with me because I am seriously contemplating starting my own blog, either on an established website or by starting my own website.) Maybe the projects that we take on won't result in publishing a book or having a movie made, but the important thing is doing something that engages our interests, that excites us, that makes us feel, in the words of the singer Hayden, that every day is too short. This is, in short, an inspirational movie. And frankly, as I've been thinking of starting my own blog (split between writing on culture and writing on contemporary politics), I have realized that I have a built in hesitancy in starting this project that this film made me feel should not be decisive. I felt, watching this, that I should . . . just start the damned blog already! In short, just as Julie was inspired by the story of Julia Child mastering the art of French cooking, so I was inspired by Julie's story. We should all be inspired to do whatever we would like to do, but have been prevented only by fear or failure. Maybe my blog will be junk and maybe no one will read it, but I've wanted to undertake it. Hopefully the story of Julie and Julia will inspire others to take on projects that they've wanted to.

So yeah, this movie hit me where I live. And that is the mark of a really good movie; it sucks you in and makes you a part of it.

Even if one doesn't experience this as a inspirational film, it is a ton of fun on a host of other levels. The cast is extraordinary, with supporting actors of the quality of Stanley Tucci and Jane Lynch in small but important roles. As I said, I'm probably Meryl Streep's smallest fan, but she really nailed Julia Childs's voice. She absolutely and completely nailed the voice, even though she was physically wrong for the role. Meryl Streep is half a foot too small for the role and really has not facial resemblance to her, but make up, pulling out every trick in the book for making her look taller (extremely high heels, surrounding Steep with shorter actors, the use of extremely short actors, and the constant use of forced perspective (the technique whereby someone is moved to the foreground while everyone else is kept in the background to make them look taller - this technique is used constantly in the Harry Potter films to make the 6'1 Robbie Coltrane to look over 8' as Hagrid). Frankly, Streep is not very convincing as Child . . . except for the voice. I hit Youtube after seeing the film and watched some clips of Julia Child and cold detect no difference between Steep's voice and Childs's. I had a much easier time enjoying Amy Adams as Julie Powell. Adams is not the virtuoso that Meryl Streep is, but she always seems so tremendously natural in every role she plays. And as Julie she plays her as Everywoman. She plays just an everyday person. They definitely glam her down for the role, giving her a remarkably nondescript hairdo and minimizing her astonishing good looks (though they can't hide those huge blue eyes). (I have to confess that I also have a soft spot for Amy Adams because she bears a sharp resemblance to an ex-girlfriend.)

The plot is a simple one. Julie Powell, feeling somewhat distraught that a pompous and somewhat absurd friend has started her own blog, decides to start her own blog. But what on? Her husband suggests doing it on something she loves. Well, she loves Julia Childs book on cooking. So she decides to cook every recipe in Childs's book and blog about it. The blog later was published as a book and . . . as the closing credits point out, made into a movie. This is all told in parallel with the story leading up to Julia Childs's growth of an interest in French cooking, her development of her interest, and her eventual publication of MASTERING THE ART OF FRENCH COOKING, the book that popularized gourmet cooking in America. The one really odd twist in their parallel stories is when Julie learns that Julia, who was aware of the blog, was disdainful of it. I would have liked to know more about this, about precisely why she found it disrespectful. One hears few bad things about Julia Childs, but this particular tidbit does not place her in a very nice light. But you have to respect Powell for pushing forward with her own project despite the disapproval of her idol.

One little twist delighted me. You know the game where you get to name the six people you would like to invite to dinner? One of the people I would invite is Bernard DeVoto, a brilliant man of letters from the mid-twentieth century, who wrote a series of brilliant popular histories and was a columnist for Harper's (in his column The Easy Chair DeVoto initiated a public information campaign against the attempt by some in Congress to sell off a huge percentage of public lands in America - he is credited with almost single-handedly stopping making most public lands private, arguably the greatest environmental achievement in American history). DeVoto was a tremendous prose writer, a powerful personality, and a natural teacher (Wallace Stegner was DeVoto's best student). So I was delighted when DeVoto's widow, Avis DeVoto, appeared in the film as the talent scout who let an editor at Alfred Knopf know about Julia's book. I have actually read a book that Avis solicited. She asked Wallace Stegner to write a biography of Bernard. Somewhat against his own inclination, Stegner agreed, producing the exceptionally nice bio THE UNEASY CHAIR.

I strongly recommend this film. And I hope that it inspires others, like it has me, to undertake their own projects. (I've already started researching web hosting services and seeing what site names are available. Julie and Julia pursued their own interests and so should we all.",1256342400,8,7675,4.541907514450867

Second, I'm not a fan of Meryl Streep. I make no defense of this. She simply rubs me the wrong way. The most I can say in making a case against her is that I'm always aware of her ""acting."" I find her deliberate and self-conscious and always ""plying her craft."" I was delighted when I heard Katherine Hepburn make the same claim. There is no doubting her talent, but for me I'm always conscious of her as an actress assuming a role, instead of becoming the role. I will not argue against anyone who believes that she is the greatest actress of her age. This is about me and my reaction to her. And it is a positive one. So, the film had these two large marks against it from my perspective, so when I say that I loved the movie, it had a fair amount to overcome.

So why did I enjoy this film so much, despite my built in biases? Because both the stories in the film - that of Julia Childs and Julie Power - were about everyday people deciding to do something that no one expected them to do. Julia Child undertaking French cooking more as a hobby, a pleasant way of passing the time, or Julie Powell writing her own blog detailing her cooking all of the recipes in the book that grew out of Julia's book. There is no difference between Julia learning to cook or Julie writing a blog and any of us - me, you, her, or him - undertaking a self-empowering project. (This resonated very strongly with me because I am seriously contemplating starting my own blog, either on an established website or by starting my own website.) Maybe the projects that we take on won't result in publishing a book or having a movie made, but the important thing is doing something that engages our interests, that excites us, that makes us feel, in the words of the singer Hayden, that every day is too short. This is, in short, an inspirational movie. And frankly, as I've been thinking of starting my own blog (split between writing on culture and writing on contemporary politics), I have realized that I have a built in hesitancy in starting this project that this film made me feel should not be decisive. I felt, watching this, that I should . . . just start the damned blog already! In short, just as Julie was inspired by the story of Julia Child mastering the art of French cooking, so I was inspired by Julie's story. We should all be inspired to do whatever we would like to do, but have been prevented only by fear or failure. Maybe my blog will be junk and maybe no one will read it, but I've wanted to undertake it. Hopefully the story of Julie and Julia will inspire others to take on projects that they've wanted to.

So yeah, this movie hit me where I live. And that is the mark of a really good movie; it sucks you in and makes you a part of it.

Even if one doesn't experience this as a inspirational film, it is a ton of fun on a host of other levels. The cast is extraordinary, with supporting actors of the quality of Stanley Tucci and Jane Lynch in small but important roles. As I said, I'm probably Meryl Streep's smallest fan, but she really nailed Julia Childs's voice. She absolutely and completely nailed the voice, even though she was physically wrong for the role. Meryl Streep is half a foot too small for the role and really has not facial resemblance to her, but make up, pulling out every trick in the book for making her look taller (extremely high heels, surrounding Steep with shorter actors, the use of extremely short actors, and the constant use of forced perspective (the technique whereby someone is moved to the foreground while everyone else is kept in the background to make them look taller - this technique is used constantly in the Harry Potter films to make the 6'1 Robbie Coltrane to look over 8' as Hagrid). Frankly, Streep is not very convincing as Child . . . except for the voice. I hit Youtube after seeing the film and watched some clips of Julia Child and cold detect no difference between Steep's voice and Childs's. I had a much easier time enjoying Amy Adams as Julie Powell. Adams is not the virtuoso that Meryl Streep is, but she always seems so tremendously natural in every role she plays. And as Julie she plays her as Everywoman. She plays just an everyday person. They definitely glam her down for the role, giving her a remarkably nondescript hairdo and minimizing her astonishing good looks (though they can't hide those huge blue eyes). (I have to confess that I also have a soft spot for Amy Adams because she bears a sharp resemblance to an ex-girlfriend.)

The plot is a simple one. Julie Powell, feeling somewhat distraught that a pompous and somewhat absurd friend has started her own blog, decides to start her own blog. But what on? Her husband suggests doing it on something she loves. Well, she loves Julia Childs book on cooking. So she decides to cook every recipe in Childs's book and blog about it. The blog later was published as a book and . . . as the closing credits point out, made into a movie. This is all told in parallel with the story leading up to Julia Childs's growth of an interest in French cooking, her development of her interest, and her eventual publication of MASTERING THE ART OF FRENCH COOKING, the book that popularized gourmet cooking in America. The one really odd twist in their parallel stories is when Julie learns that Julia, who was aware of the blog, was disdainful of it. I would have liked to know more about this, about precisely why she found it disrespectful. One hears few bad things about Julia Childs, but this particular tidbit does not place her in a very nice light. But you have to respect Powell for pushing forward with her own project despite the disapproval of her idol.

One little twist delighted me. You know the game where you get to name the six people you would like to invite to dinner? One of the people I would invite is Bernard DeVoto, a brilliant man of letters from the mid-twentieth century, who wrote a series of brilliant popular histories and was a columnist for Harper's (in his column The Easy Chair DeVoto initiated a public information campaign against the attempt by some in Congress to sell off a huge percentage of public lands in America - he is credited with almost single-handedly stopping making most public lands private, arguably the greatest environmental achievement in American history). DeVoto was a tremendous prose writer, a powerful personality, and a natural teacher (Wallace Stegner was DeVoto's best student). So I was delighted when DeVoto's widow, Avis DeVoto, appeared in the film as the talent scout who let an editor at Alfred Knopf know about Julia's book. I have actually read a book that Avis solicited. She asked Wallace Stegner to write a biography of Bernard. Somewhat against his own inclination, Stegner agreed, producing the exceptionally nice bio THE UNEASY CHAIR.

I strongly recommend this film. And I hope that it inspires others, like it has me, to undertake their own projects.

i liked how they made both stories of the 2 women parallel eachother.  it inspired me how both women were motivated to write their first book/blog based on cooking.  i learned a lot about Julia Child that i didn't know about - that she was an American from Pasadena!  and that her first job was working as a government employee!

one glaring problem that i hope they correct when releasing the DVD is to edit out several shots of the ""overhead"" microphone - it appeared at least 5 times.  the scenes maybe nearer to the end when Meryl Streep is sitting on a couch and talking to her friend, and another when she's with her husband.  it's really obvious because the background wall is green and there's this black microphone bobbing up and down, almost dead-center at the top edge of the screen.",1252972800,4,1734,5.979757085020243

I thought Meryl Streep deserved an academy award for her performance -- it was brilliant.  In fact this movie portrayed marriage in the most favorable light I have seen in years and it certainly showed marriage as I have experienced it.  All of the characters in this movie came across as real and likeable people.  I thought the male leads were sort of kept in the background and the movie would have benefited if they had been given a larger role but the movie was still one of the best movies I have seen in a very long time.

The cooking scenes were absolutely outstanding and clearly illustrated how difficult it is too cook gourmet meals.  Very few people cook like this and the movie indirectly shows how hard it is because the shopping alone is difficult.  Of course Julia Child cooked the ""French"" way which meant fresh ingredients procured the day of use.  Practical in Paris but not so practical in New York.  The movie showed this but never focused on it.  The movie also showed how men love their wives and support them.  There was no dysfunctionality in these marriages.

3976023,4,B002RSDW80,"""Julie and Julia"" is a wonderful ""aprs diner"" tribute to the woman who brought French cooking (and decent food in general) to the American dinner table. Julie Powell is a not-quite-successful 30-year-old writer in NYC hoping to find her stride by blogging through all of Julia Childs' ""Mastering the Art of French Cooking"" in a year. The movie switches backs and forth between Julie's gustatorial struggles and the story of the real Julia Child as she toiled in pre-feminist 1950s France to find her own place in the world. Meryl Streep does a loopy, slightly over-the-top rendition of Julia that is charming, funny and loving. But Stanley Tucci, who played Julia's devoted diplomat husband Paul, really stole the show with his charm, reserve, self-effacement and undying devotion to his brilliant wife. Topically, the film  manages a few comments at the difficulty of supporting victims of 9/11 as well as to the witch-hunting McCarthy days, in which a love of European culture was enough to make one suspicious in the eyes of uber-patriotic American officials.

3976024,5,B002RSDW80,"Nora Ephron's ""Julie and Julia"" is the story of two women who seem to have nothing in common except for a passionate love of cooking.  Julie Powell, played with sweetness and vulnerability by the adorable Amy Adams, has a depressing and low paying job fielding heartrending telephone calls from 9/11 victims.  She lives with her devoted husband, Eric (Chris Messina), in a tiny, rundown apartment above a pizzeria in Queens.  She feels despondent and rudderless until she starts a cooking blog in 2002.  From there, she moves on to an even bigger challenge.  She will prepare all 524 recipes from Child's ""Mastering the Art of French Cooking"" in 365 days.  Julie's story is juxtaposed with that of Julia Child, whom we meet when she moves to Paris with her husband, Paul (the marvelous Stanley Tucci) in the forties.  Like Julie Powell, Julia felt vaguely dissatisfied with her life.  A class at Le Cordon Bleu in Paris (where she was not welcomed) not only taught Child French cooking, but also led to her collaboration with two French women in writing her iconic book.

Meryl Streep is perfection as Child, an ebullient and energetic individual with an insatiable appetite for food and a deep love for the man who was always there for her.  She pranced around a scenic Paris with zest, shopping for ingredients and lovingly preparing gorgeous meals for her friends and family.  All was not sweetness and light, however.  Ironically, Child was childless, and cooking was the outlet that she needed to feel useful and creative.  Ephron moves back and forth in time, showing how Julie connects almost telepathically with Julia through the food that she prepares.  With manic intensity, she agonizes over her cooking successes and failures, to the point where she almost drives Eric away with her intense self-absorption.

""Julie and Julia"" is funny, poignant, and immensely entertaining.  The director elicits wonderful performances from her leads, and with cinematic trickery, she even manages to make Streep appear to be over six feet tall.  Not only is this an engrossing character study, but the film is also an inspiring exploration of how an ordinary person can bring her dreams to fruition if she has the gumption and tenacity to overcome obstacles and continue to believe in herself.  Although their lives were not perfect, Julie and Julia found bliss through food and they generously shared their joy with the world.",1251763200,2,2424,5.002493765586035
3976025,4,B002RSDW80,"Take equal parts Meryl Streep and Amy Adams.  Add a dash of Stanley Tucci and have chef/director Nora Ephron whip up a delicious patisserie of confectionary delight in the true tale, Julie & Julia.  Combining two source books, Julie Powell's Julie & Julia and Julia Child's My Life in France, Ephron's screen adaptation parallels the lives of up and coming master chef Child and aspiring writer Powell who uses Child's cookbook as the inspiration for her ambitious blog.  The results, while not a five star meal, is certainly an entertaining, well acted drama highlighted by some amusing situations.

Two married women from different times and places yearn to satisfy their inner desire for independence.  In 1949, Julia Child and her US civil servant husband, Paul, are stationed in Paris, France.  Wanting to do something besides sitting around like other wives of the period, she endeavors a variety of classes from hat making to bridge lessons until she and Paul hit upon the fact that she loves to eat.  Thus she embarks on a mission to conquer cooking schools and the art of culinary cuisine.  In 2002, with similar desires for a more fulfilling life as an author, Julie Powell is getting adjusted to Queens, New York, with her husband, Eric.  Powell's frustrations are channeled into a blog that documents her attempts to realize all 524 recipes in Julia Child's famous cookbook in 365 days no less.  The two lead characters depend on the publishing world for success-Child with her constantly delayed French cookbook manuscript that grows to 700 pages and the doubting responses of skeptical publishers, and Julie with her daily blogs as her way of garnering attention from a publisher.  Both women's lives are set on a journey of self discovery and validation as they find that their goals will be sprinkled with adversity and roadblocks.  Ultimately it will be their sheer will, self reflection, and the love of their respective spouses that will see them through in their quests.

Streep is perhaps the best actress of the past thirty years and this role only serves to elevate her status. Although the role is not a tortured soul as in Sophie's Choice or Kramer vs. Kramer, she embodies Child as a larger than life bon vivant while mimicking her voice and mannerisms with startling acumen and enthusiam.  Child's character gets more development than Powell.  As she walks with Paul, her subtle reaction to a baby carriage and subsequent meltdown at the news of her sister's pregnancy is an interesting revelation.  Her love of French food becomes an avocation and her life's calling.  The cooking moments are convincing including a cute sequence involving chopped onions that will have audiences chuckling.  She is a woman's libber by default as she attends a more advanced, male dominated cooking class.

It's a pity that any actor in a Streep film would suffer by comparison.  Yet Adams throws herself in the more contemporary but less developed role with gusto.  Her role is more of the everywoman who cooks as a form of therapy.  Powell's background can't quite compete with the rich history of Child's origins, but what she does get is a following and respect from fans and publishers.  What Ephron should have done toward the end is to reemphasize how Powell's inability to finish anything of merit has come full circle with this accomplishment and would have provided a more compelling character development.

Stanley Tucci is a standout who more than holds his own with Streep's Child.  It is an Oscar-worthy performance.  Chris Messina is a star on the rise as Eric Powell; he performs well with an essentially one note role.

 There are nice moments including an amusing scene when Julie and Eric watch Dan Aykroyd's classic Saturday Night Live take on Julia Child.  A subplot involving the House Un-American Activities Committee detracts from the overall spirit of Child's story, and the film does slow a bit in the last half-hour but never loses interest completely.  Ephron does well by linking similar themes and events that each woman experiences thus providing a bond and segue over time and space.  One wishes that there was a more direct connection between the two women and even a chance meeting, but we have to settle for indirect links and the sharing of kindred spirits.

Don't expect anything more than an interesting character study of two women bound by a love for food and search for purpose in their lives.  Julie & Julia is light but satisfying fare highlighted by a sumptuous main course, Meryl Streep.  Bon appetite!",1251590400,2,4558,4.938320209973753

Desperate for something to fill her life, she decides to cook her way through Julia Child's cookbook and blog about her culinary adventures.  Interspersed with Julie's scenes, we see glimpses of Julia Child's life in Paris forty years earlier as she finds her niche in the culinary world.

If you love cooking and/or Julia Child you will love this movie based  on Julie Powell's blog.  For me, cooking is a tedious chore and I don't share their passion for the kitchen stove. That said, Meryl Streep does a wonderful job playing the joyful Julia, her scenes in Paris are fun, and the movie would have been a lot better if it was just about her.  Amy Adams is bland as the young New Yorker who idolizes Julia and her story seemed pointless.  I still don't know why she thought following someone else's recipes was so noteworthy (or interesting).

3976028,4,B002RSDW80,"Cute without breaking into cloying, Nora Ephrons' ""Julie and Julia"" does an extraordinary job in running the parallel stories of Julie (Amy Adams, always perky) and Julia Child (Meryll Streep, more ham than a cook book allows) discovering themselves through the world of cooking. Filled with good humor and sumptuous views of food, it's a family film that is more for the family than the kids. Oh, and if you're a foodie? This is borderline food-porn.

A lot of the F-P aspect has to do with the cooking, which is done is such detail that ""Julie and Julia"" is almost a love letter to the value of a good kitchen. Julie works in a cruddy cubicle job, lives in a dingy apartment, and is a frustrated writer who is confounded that her circle of friends has become self-absorbed successes. Her boyfriend convinces her to set up a cooking blog, and Julie settles on ""The&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Julie-Julia-365-Days-524-Recipes-1-Tiny-Apartment-Kitchen/dp/B000FCKHA6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Julie/Julia: 365 Days, 524 Recipes, 1 Tiny Apartment Kitchen</a>"" project and begins her cooking odyssey.

Meanwhile, in 1950's Paris, Julia Child decides she wants to make something of her life, so husband Paul (delightfully dapper Stanley Tucci, deserving of a supporting actor nod) agrees to help her enter a school for French Chefs...and that's when Julia hits on the idea for her cookbook. Julie and Julia's stories then intermingle (although sometimes in a forced fit) that make for good entertainment.

The minor dramas in each life are handled well and with taste, such as Child's sadness over infertility, the encroachment of McCarthyism, Julie's ""meltdowns"" and her breakup with her boyfriend Eric (Chris Messina). But mostly, this is a love letter to the glory of food and to Julia Child, whom Streep plays with glorious wit and abandon. As she ages, Streep has become more free and graceful, willing to let fly even in the most silly of roles (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mamma-Mia/dp/B001GKJ2DY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mamma Mia!</a>&nbsp;anyone) while never allowing any doubt about her acting brilliance.

3976029,5,B002RSDW80,"This movie is so cute (at least to me) that you want to pinch its cheeks and tell it how much it's grown. While most movies are based on one true story, here we get two.  Amy Adams plays Julie, a cubicle drone and cooking enthusiast, who has recently moved to a cramped apartment with her husband and cat.  (Unlike so many movie dwellings, the apartment actually looks believable; most movie people regardless of income seem to live in palatial penthouses.)  To give her life more direction, she decides to write a blog in which she'll detail her adventure cooking recipes from Julia Child's cookbook within a year's deadline.

Running parallel to her story is that of Julia Child (Meryl Streep) and her evolution as a famous cook and cookbook author; this takes place mostly in France in the fifties, but the transitions between the two stories are smooth. While Julie believes that her idol has always been poised and successful, the viewer sees that Julia's life had plenty of ups and downs - for instance, her cookbook went through several publishing houses and revisions before finding its place.

This one of the few movies I've seen lately that does not seem to be congratulating itself on how witty the dialogue is; nor does it try to cram in as many montages as possible, as shorthaand for character development. One warning: there are a lot of scrumptious closeups of the recipes, so bring extra jujubes.",1250812800,,1414,4.755102040816326
3976030,4,B002RSDW80,"Julie and Julia contrasts the elegant fifties expatriate lifestyle of Julia Child and her husband with the youthful contemporary life of Julie Powell, a  college educated temp office worker who lives in a Queens walkup. Both of them share a love of cooking and their husbands. Julie starts cooking her way through Child's cookbook ""Mastering the Art of French Cooking"" motivated by a feeling of malaise about turning thirty and having to do secretarial work. Her mom lives in Texas and is not exactly supportive. Julia Child turns into a kind of maternal figure for Julie, i.e., the wise, witty, urbane mother that Julie needs to find her way as an adult.

Meryl Streep is over the top as Julia Child which is fine, since Child was a woman who loved to call attention to herself. Julie (Amy Adams) is more self-effacing, unfortunately. One of the great things about Julie's original blog was its profanity and downright snarkiness; I miss that edgy quality in the cinematic Julie's character. Julie is just too nice in this film. The scenes that take place in postwar Paris are the best in the film. The costumes are by the wonderful Ann Roth (I hope she gets another Oscar nomination for them). The scenes in New York are shot on location. As is so often the case in New York apartments portrayed in the movies, their apartment is much more spacious and charming than such an apartment would ever be in reality. I guess that showing the way low-income New Yorkers actually live would be too shocking to the ordinary viewer.",1250726400,2,1524,4.725563909774436
3976031,4,B002RSDW80,Amy Adams is a great actress but many people were disappointed in her role in this movie. I heartily disagree- I found her poignant and endearing.  Meryl Streep just nails Julia Childs's mannerisms- but I am not sure she really understood what Julia was all about. I enjoyed her perfomance but I think she missed the heart of Julia Childs- her boundless enthusiasm for learning and living.  Maybe this last was an impossible standard to meet- few people realize that Julia Childs was a huge role model for the men who grew up in the late sixties and Seventies: She taught the men of America the value of enjoying life and living. And the value of approaching life with enthusiasm. She had a huge impact on this country far greater than most people really understand. So maybe my expectations of Ms Streep are simply impossibly high in this particular instance.,1250553600,3,860,4.726666666666667
3976032,4,B002RSDW80,"Meryl Streep is amazing.  I know this is hardly a revelation to anyone...but just when you think you appreciate Streep at the right level...she pulls off a performance like the one she gives in JULIE & JULIA.  Don't get me wrong, her Julia Child is not among her greatest work.  It won't be remembered generations from now.  But what it does make you appreciate is that even in a ""minor"" film like this, Streep gives it her all and comes up with one of her most purely delightful characterizations yet.  She could have coasted, and she would have been good.  Instead, she transcends the modest trappings of this entertaining yet hardly important film.

JULIE & JULIA follows two stories.  They aren't even parallel stories in particular, but simply two very different tales connected by an appreciation for cooking (and Julia Child).

Story #1 follows a portion of Julia Child's life in the `50s.  She's the loving, energetic, wide-eyed, open-hearted wife of a career diplomat (Paul Child, beautifully played by Stanley  Tucci...the perfect match to Streep).  They've moved to France, and Streep is determined to immerse herself in her new home.  She loves almost everything about the city...but she's two awkwardly built to get much out of the fashions.  But she immediately falls in love with the food, and for  her, it's not enough to just enjoy eating it...she must learn to prepare it.  Her battle to be accepted into the Cordon Bleu, her realization that Americans need to understand how to make food this wonderful and her drive to write the first American cookbook of French food is the track of the story.  But the HEART of the story is simply the unbridled, undisguised joy that Child brings to her every encounter.  She loves her husband mightily.  She loves food and cooking with a palpable passion.  And she's warm and generous to everyone around her.  If Streep's portrayal is accurate, Julia Child was just about the best person you'd ever want to hang out with...she seemed to make everyone around her feel good about themselves.  Streep also has mastered (big surprise), Child's unusual and unmistakable voice.  It's such a remarkable performance that it seems almost inevitable that Streep will receive yet another Oscar nomination...and even though it's a slight film...I think it may be deserved.

Story #2 is set in the year of so following 9/11.  Julie Powell works in a fairly miserable job taking claims from family members of 9/11 victims.  She spends most of her day either being chewed out by callers for the thick bureaucracy they must wade through, or crying with them as they recount their horrible stories (all of this is lightly touched on, of course...wouldn't want to make the film TOO heavy.)  Julie and her husband Eric live in a cramped apartment above a pizzeria in Queens, and Julie is just generally not too happy with her life.  She and Eric are deeply in love, but she feels restless.  She sets upon the idea of going through Julia Child's cookbook, trying to cook every recipe in the space of one year...and to blog about it.  She's a witty writer and her blog is a huge success.  She cooks a lot, spends lot of time blogging, and sometimes hubby feels neglected, which leads to some fights.  The trajectory of this story is highly predictable and the stakes feel very low indeed.  Amy Adams plays Julie, and while she sparkles from time to time (can Amy Adams NOT sparkle), she also feels a bit listless.  Frankly, there isn't much to her character, the script gives her little real meat to go with and whatever depth we see is due to Adams wrestling it out of the script.  Chris Messina as Eric is agreeable and pulls of the devotion to Julie very well...but he also seems squishy and too  ""good, kind and understanding.""  Tucci certainly is much the same way as Paul Child, but his character has a spark of dry humor and wit that Eric just doesn't have.

I would have liked the experience of JULIE & JULIA much more had we simply spent more time with Julia Child, perhaps taking her to the start of her TV show rather than the day of publication of her first book.  Certainly the story of Julie Powell on its own would not make a good film at all, so it feels somewhat propped up by the Julia Child story.

I'd give the JULIA portion of the film 4.5 stars...its lightweight quality is more than offset by great work from Streep and excellent support from Stanley Tucci, Jane Lynch & others.  I'd give JULIE a bare 3 stars...the food always looks great, and Amy Adams is something of a force...but the overall story carries little weight.  So that's 3.75.  Seems about right.

This is a feel good movie, and while I don't know if full price tickets at the cinema is worth it...I can certainly imagine a cozy night with the DVD, some nice wine and some rich, tasty food.",1250467200,5,4814,4.673008323424495

That, plus her television shows, plus other seminal works of American culture mean that she worked for decades so become an overnight success.

I'm not belittling Ms. Powell's accomplishments. But the juxtaposition of these two bodies of work comes down heavily on one side.  The movie is reflective of that imbalance.",1250380800,,1824,7.52112676056338
3976035,5,B002RSDW80,"Julie, a young, aspiring writer in a depressing job, decides to cook her way through Julia Child's book Mastering the Art of French Cooking in one year and to blog about it. This new activity becomes an obsession that strains her marriage, but in the end it provides her with the recognition she longed for.

While Julie is working her way through the recipes, the movie flashes back some fifty years earlier to follow Julia Child who has just moved with her husband to France. She finds herself with time on her hands and begins searching for something to do. She tries hat making, which palls, and then decides to go to cooking school, because what she really enjoys in life is, well, eating. She is the only woman in her class but is unflappable.

This is a feel-good film about how these two women used persistence and their passion for food to find personal fulfillment and the generous, understanding men who loved and supported them. The acting was fabulous, the scenes colorful and vibrant, the comedic moments well-timed and the sad moments poignant and fleeting.

What strikes me the most is how one woman making a single decision and following her passion has impacted so many of us. Julia Child was just a middle-aged married woman in Paris with nothing to do who took up a hobby. And thanks to Julie's blogging, which inspired this movie, I am now a fan of Julie Child.

3976036,4,B002RSDW80,"In 1949, Julia and Paul Child moved to Paris. For a while, newly unemployed, Julia flounders about for something to do, and finally hits upon cooking. It's France, after all.  In 2004, Julie and Eric Powell moved to Queens, NY. Julie thought she'd become a writer, but has become stalled in a depressing job answering calls for the post 9/11 World Trade Center. She flounders about for some meaning in her life, and finally starts a blog, for which she will attempt to cook all of Julia Child's recipes in one years time. It's not Paris, after all.

Julie and Julia juxtaposes the stories of these two cooks. Meryl Streep, in the sort of virtuoso performance we've come to expect from her, is spot on, and very effective, in her portrayal of Julia. Amy Adams has the simpler task, and brings a pleasing credibility to her role as Julie. Julia sets out to become a teacher and ends up a writer, going on to make history. Julie sets out to become a writer, and what sort of mark she will make remains to be seen. Stanley Tucci and Chris Messina are well cast as the respective well-fed, supportive husbands. Sets, scenery, and costumes are picture perfect, with subtle lighting and period charm.

Julia, of course, made history, and it remains to be seen what sort of mark Julie will make. In their film, these women demonstrate what personal effort,  genuine love, and a bit of luck can accomplish. Don't miss it.",1250294400,3,1625,4.671328671328672
3976037,4,B002RSDW80,"I have no illusions that Nora Ephron's ""Julie & Julia"" is a complete or accurate depiction of either Julie Powell or Julia Child. It achieves exactly what it wants to achieve simply by being a pleasant, light-hearted movie. I admit that part of me is a little disappointed by this; because it goes for pure feel-good entertainment, I suspect the exact same story could have been told whether or not the characters were drawn from real people. As fun and loveable as they appear on screen, Powell and Child seem no more or less authentic than sitcom personalities, which is to say they appeal to our fun side but don't really go any deeper than that. I enjoyed them as characters, but I can't say that I learned anything about them as people. They were, in fact, so narrowly drawn that they were just shy of one-dimensional.

Let's start with Julia Child. She's played by Meryl Streep, and if you think she's yet again another shoe-in for an Oscar nomination, you'd be right. Streep's performance is nothing short of flawless, having perfected Child's distinctively deep voice and bubbly personality. What seems flawed is the way Child was developed for Streep: Are we seeing the real Julia Child, or are we seeing the Julia Child she presented herself as for television? I obviously have no way of knowing for sure, but on the basis of this film, I would guess that we weren't seeing the woman behind the image. Some have said that her TV persona was one and the same with her real persona, but how can anyone know for sure? Chances are you've never met her. I can only go with my gut and say that, in most cases, the way celebrities behave in front of a camera is different from the way they behave in their personal lives.

That being said, the image we see in this film is certainly a nice one. Starting in 1949 and continuing throughout the `50s in Paris, her story paints a portrait of an eager, determined, energetic person who simply wanted to do something with her life. Realizing her passion is food, her remarkably supportive husband, Paul (Stanley Tucci), encourages her to pursue something in that field. And so she does: She attends the world renowned Le Cordon Bleu. And in spite of stiff competition and a snooty old woman in charge of the place, Child becomes a chef. She eventually meets a very pleasant woman named Simone Beck (Linda Emond), and the two decide to write a French cookbook for Americans. It proves to be a massive undertaking, one that will consume Child for the next several years.

Now let's talk about Julie Powell. She's played by Amy Adams, who thus far has never failed to play someone loveable. Her story takes place in 2002, right as she moves into a tiny apartment above a pizza shop in Queens with her husband, Eric (Chris Messina). Powell, an aspiring writer who never had anything published, finds herself sick of sitting behind a cubicle taking calls about 9/11 insurance. She decides to make a name for herself by writing a blog. But what to write about? Lo and behold, she has a copy of ""Mastering the Art of French Cooking,"" co-authored by Julia Child. She then sets a goal for herself: In the space of 365 days, she will cook all of the book's 524 recipes and document her progress on the blog. As the year progresses, she becomes more and more consumed with her project. Worse yet, she can never stop gushing over Julia Child, nor can she go more than a day without saying how spiritually and mentally connected they are. Not surprisingly, it begins to put a strain on her marriage.

We're essentially being shown a portrait of two women separated by time yet united by sheer determination. The problem with a concept like determination is that it can often be mistaken as mere single-mindedness, and indeed, both Child and Powell are portrayed as so one-tracked that they occasionally become annoying. Honestly, how did the husbands put up with them for so long? Paul Child, as depicted in this movie, is so accepting and so soft-spoken that you'd swear he had absolutely no opinions of his own. As for Eric Powell, there does come a point when he loses his temper and leaves the apartment for a few days. But on the whole, he too is complacent and unassuming, so much so that it has a tendency to drag the story down.

But as flawed as this movie is, I can't fault it for being exactly what it wants to be: Entertaining. ""Julie & Julia"" is like a fluffy souffl that hits the tongue and melts, which is to say that it gives us something sweet and airy before evaporating. I may not have learned much about either Julie Powell or Julia Child, but at least I can say that, for two hours, I was given the chance to indulge in cinematic goodness. What made the experience richer were the talents of Meryl Streep and Amy Adams, who continue to prove what great actresses they really are. Of course, we all know what overindulgence will lead to, so I urge you not to see too many movies like this in one sitting. Instead, spend more time in search of fresher films with more wholesome ingredients. Might I suggest ""(500) Days of Summer""?",1250121600,15,5083,4.569078947368421

  The 6 foot 2 inches tall, dearly beloved chef Julie Child, is masterfully portrayed by Meryl Streep. Meryl imitates Child's unique melodious voice and her laugh and shrugs and facial expression with upbeat, cheery enthusiasm.
  Child's had the advantage of wealth and education growing up. She ""married well"" to Paul Child, and American diplomat, played by Stanley Tucci. They had the best life offered, living in Paris, France in the late ""40 and early '50's. Julia immersed herself into the French way of life. Totally adored the foods, wines, shopping in the outside markets and carefully selecting just the right ingredients by smelling the produce and becoming friendly with the vendors.. ""I feel like I AM French!"" she'd say. Effortlessly Julia created new dishes to serve her happy husband and also hosted small dinner parties for very appreciative friends.
  This two hour movie is based on Two true stories. The lesser known Julie is a employed, ""lowly cubicle worker"", played by Amy Adams. Julie Powers also has a loving and supportive husband. (A rare story line in today's movie offerings.)  29 year old Powers also longs for something more in life. She and husband both use public transportation to work and live in a crammed apt. above a pizza parlor in Queens, N.Y..
  Powers is a huge admirer of the legendary Julia Child. She tells her husband, ""I could write a book! I have thoughts!"" Powers passion leads her to set up a blog to record her daily progress, as she prepares, from Child's famous cookbook, 524 recipes in 361 days. A incrediable undertaking with limited resources and in a very small kitchen.

Grateful audiences are going to be laughing and crying and being inspired by this movie for a long, long time. The Julie portion is the weaker of the two, but not so weak that it sinks the film.

Meryl Streep as Julia Child is one of the most endearing, arresting performances ever. That the real Julia Child and her groupies irritate me no end in no way interfered with my appreciation of Streep's amazing characterization. I laughed and cried several times, I was so engaged in the cinematic Streep/Child's story.

Streep's chemistry with Stanley Tucci as Paul Child, Julia's husband, is breathtaking. No attempt is made to make Streep or Tucci conventionally attractive. No attempt is made to make them look young and dewy - they weren't - Julia married Paul when she was in her thirties and he was ten years older. Julia is tall; Paul is short; Julia is loud; Paul is bald, quiet and retiring. It is implied that they can't have children. They don't share conventionally romantic movie moments; they don't ""meet cute,"" there's no candlelight, no slow dances, no full frontal nudity, no vulgar language (with one hilarious exception involving cannelloni). All Paul and Julia do is share the drudgery and rewards of working life: hers as a cook, his as a state department official. The key to Streep and Tucci's chemistry is that they portray two characters who love each other. Watching a loving, married couple in a marriage that works is one of the great, and sadly rare, pleasures of this film. Steep and Tucci are every bit as charismatic a couple as Tracy and Hepburn. Jane Lynch is also brilliant in a small role as Julia's sister.

The Julia segments take place in post-war Paris, and the Paris of this film, one of elegant cafes, haute couture and vintage cars, is someplace we all wished we lived (except for the ever-present cigarette smoke.) No matter how you feel about cooking, the film gets you to care about Julia's slowly being drawn into her destiny as one of the legendary chefs of all time. You also care about, and respect, Paul, his career and its ups and downs in the McCarthy era, and his support of his wife.

The Julie Powell portion of the movie is the weaker portion. I really like the film's structure of switching back and forth between contemporary Queens and post-war Paris, contrasting a career woman's attempt to cook all of Julia Child's recipes with Julia Child herself, before she became famous. I just think that the film fails its own structure by simply not making the Julie Powell portion as interesting as the Julia Child portion. Some have complained that Queens is depicted as being too dismal, and Paris too elegant. It's more than that, though.

I think Ephron, a brilliant filmmaker, drops the ball with Julie Powell because she never engages the tough questions about Powell's experiment. Was Powell just someone eager for fame in the Warhol era of ""Everyone is famous for fifteen minutes""? Was Powell parasitizing Child's fame? Was Powell a bad wife to her husband as she obsessed on completing her self assigned task? Have blogs killed quality writing? Was Julia Child correct in her condemnation of Powell?

I am not saying that the answer to any of the above questions is ""Yes."" I'm not bashing Julie Powell. I'm saying that by not engaging them, Ephron made the Julie portion of the film simply not as interesting as it could have been had these very real questions been engaged. Instead, Ephron tries to turn Julie into a cute, bland Meg Ryan character, and it never works, not for an instant. When Powell has lunch with her career gal friends, her friends are such Gordon Gecko style sharks that we care less for Powell for being so needy as to want to impress them. The absolute worst scene in the movie comes when Powell, who has never been depicted as feeling happy or fulfilled, not with her job, not with her husband, not with her home life, plays 65 answering machine messages from agents, editors, and publishers who want to make her famous. As these messages play, she has sex with her husband, and her husband's comment lets us know that this is the first time in a long while that he has experienced satisfaction from his wife.

The message of that scene is so tawdry, it cheapens the glow created by the Julia portion of the film, that shows Julia Child achieving satisfaction *before she ever becomes famous*. Julia *loved* cooking. Julia *loved* her husband. Yes, she celebrates when Knopf wants to publish her book, but she is so divorced from the rat race that she doesn't even know how to pronounced ""Knopf"" - whether the initial K is silent.

Julie Powell is depicted as needing fame to feel good about herself, and the movie never interrogates that. Had it done so, the Julie segments would have been as interesting as the Julia ones.

In any case, this is a great film that will enjoy a much deserved embrace by its fans.",1249948800,2,5009,4.695899772209567
3976041,5,B002RSDW80,"I found myself tearful, for the life she had and the one I thought I had. I moved to the Bay Area in 1966 as a new bride. Julia Child was brand new to me and I was smitten. I learned to cook well, attending La Varenne in Paris, and learned to laugh at my mistakes (I also learned that a glass of wine couldn't hurt). I'm so glad she had her dream man and I'm not a bit jealous. I love Meryl Streep and think she captured Julia like no one else could. I buy very few DVDs (Disney for my grandkids, a rare documentary for me), but signed up for this one. I loved it.",1249776000,5,564,3.8290598290598292
3976042,4,B002RSDW80,"Julie Powell (Amy Adams) is a writer who can't finish anything. She's started her novel and only got half way through before giving up on it, and works in post 9/11 New York taking phone calls from people reeling from the tragedy. Julia Child (Meryl Streep) is a newlywed living in post-war France with her husband Paul (Stanley Tucci) who works for the American Embassy. Julia is looking for something to give her life meaning she tries hat making, and bridge and loses interest in those fairly quickly. When she enters Le Cordon Bleu school of cooking she finds her passion in life.

Julie and Julia is really two stories that run concurrently and mirror each other. When Adam's Julie decides to challenge herself to cook her way through Julia Child's famous book The Art of French Cooking she encounters obstacles and victories she might not have anticipated when taking on the project. Child's story is about how she overcame the obstacles of being an ambitious American in France after WWII. Learned how to cook and the struggle of writing and getting her book published. Both Julie's and Julia's stories are also love stories, each has a husband that is supportive to greater or lesser degrees. Tucci's Paul Child is unflaggingly supportive of his wife, and also very much in love with her. I grew up seeing Julia Childs cooking show on TV and she always struck me as being asexual, but for those who harbor similar opinions this movie will put that idea to rest. Julie and her husband Eric (Chris Messing) have a more modern relationship, and while Eric is supportive at times Julie's ""meltdowns"" get to him and they have arguments and he's not sure if he can take her mood swings.

Streep is great as Julia Child, she has her character down pat and injects a lot of life and humor into Child. Stanley Tucci as Paul Child almost steals the show from Streep, he's madly love with Julia and he has almost as many good lines as Streep. Amy Adams is good as Julie Powell. Adams' Powell is very cute and not as confident as Child in the cooking, and has some very funny scenes. The scene where she has to cook live lobsters and she feels very guilty about it while the Talking Heads song Psycho Killer plays is hilarious. I somewhat enjoyed the Child/Streep story a little more, but that's just degrees, it may be the French setting and time seem more intriguing than Powell's/Adams contemporary setting. I would also like to mention Mary Lynn Rajskub's role as Julie's friend is an above average performance and caught my attention, it's a little more than your standard sidekick/friend role.",1249689600,5,2595,4.701098901098901
3976043,4,B002RSDW80,"It is a story of two women ,and how food ,friends and good wine bring people together.
Was apprehensive about seeing this film. I love the director's ( Nora Ephron) books. Her blog about food & politics on Huff Post is awesome. That being said, her movies disappoint me. This one however, is a delightful exception.
As soon as I saw the scene were Meryl and Stanley Tucci are enjoying fish together , I was hooked. The pair of  them have great chemistry together. Stanley has a wry charm about him and Meryl nails Julia Child completely.
The cinematography was great. The color scheme and clothing makes you feel  like you are visiting France in the fifties. The food was beautiful. The boeuf bourguignonne made my mouth water and I don't even like beef. I craved bruschetta  so bad that I went home and made my own version .
I worked as a operator for a Help line for almost two years and could relate to Julie feeling crabby and unfulfilled in life. Chris Messina plays the kind of guy I should be dating,very funny ,supportive,but refuses to let Julie wallow in self pity. I liked that both these 2 couples found somebody who loved them through good and bad and helped push them to become even better. It gives me hope that I will find someone as well.",1249689600,3,1255,4.471615720524017
3976044,5,B002RSDW80,"A change of plans kept me from seeing Julie and Julia on its release date. But luckily I saw it on it's second day out. Wow! It is the best movie - by far - that I have seen in quite some time. Everything about the story was woven together so well. And unlike some movies that have casting problems, the casting was perfect in this movie.  Every character was believable and superb in their role.

I love the weaving together of the stories and the end was brilliant.

If you ever feel down or discouraged, you might want to own a copy of this movie to have handy.  Watch it and you will feel a whole new view of yourself and the world. This movie did what good movies are supposed to do: you are changed once you see it.",1249689600,2,721,4.092198581560283
3976045,3,B002RSDW80,"Food is love. Food fills you, contains its share of substitute ingredients, or can be one itself.

Iconic chef/author/TV star Julia Child learned French cooking in Paris because, in her words, it was ""something to do because I needed something to do"" in France's uncertain days after WWII. Young wife Julie Powell learned Julia Child's French recipes and cooked each, blogging her efforts. This would help her rise above domineering mom, friends, and cubicle job in New York post-9/11.

Nora Ephron thus cooked up ""Julie and Julia"" not only from Ms. Child's biography and Ms. Powell's respective books but from her recipe of notorious ""chick flick"" hits directed and/or written with Rob Reiner (""Sleepless In Seattle,"" ""You've Got Mail."") In each, lovers bond gradually from a distance through a commonly loved film, a new technology or, in this case, admiration for delicious food and a need for self-expression. But this distance is time, this love bonding not only husbands and wives but a student for her mentor and mentor's textbook.

Helped by Meryl Streep's dead-on impersonation, Ephron skillfully chronicles Ms. Child's early, gawky attempts to find her voice and vocation in sepia-toned, post-WWII Paris. Her beloved husband Paul (a dignified, doting Stanley Tucci) helps win WWII with his intelligence efforts, then is grilled mercilessly in the early 50's Cold War/McCarthy-era.  Gradually, Ms. Child not only becomes an expert French chef through perseverance and competitiveness (an amusing, tear-inducing scene with a chopped onion mountain), but gains relationships and business sense to see ""Mastering The Art of French Cooking"" fulfill her husband's promise as a book to change the world.

Ms. Child's book changed the life of Julie Powell (a perky, enticing Amy Adams). She attempts to fulfill her novelist promise as a thirtysomething by recording her efforts to make all Ms. Child's recipes. This leads to complications humorous, if expected (battles cooking eggs and containing live lobsters, cleverly adapting a Talking Heads classic) as well as a brief, incongruent conflict with her otherwise supportive husband (Chris Mussina) which ends half-baked after starting as overdone as her attempt at Child's boeuf bourguignon.

""Julie and Julia"" has sweet, occasionally savory moments: Ms. Child's heartbreak over her infertility, Ms. Powell's frustration and tears over being stood up by one important dinner guest and having her efforts frowned on by her idol. It also has Ms. Powell's admiration of Ms. Child boil over, especially near film's end. But overall, in a summer dominated by adolescent toys, games, and books becoming cookie-cutter films, ""Julie and Julia"" is a light, sweet, atmospheric grown-up treat.",1249689600,10,2737,5.398126463700234
3976046,4,B002RSDW80,"It's great to see an entertaining grown-up movie make a strong summer debut.  We saw ""Julie & Julia"" with a full-house crowd who clearly enjoyed themselves.  I recommend the movie, yet I can't help but feel that because the story cut back between the two women's stories, I did not really get to know either one of them on a deep level.

Meryl Streep was fantastic but I was frustrated that her Julia was so unfailingly polite and ""on,"" as though she were performing for an audience, even in her private moments.  She was *always* lovely to her husband; quirky, fun, winning over even the French.  It's not that I wanted to see her show a ""dark side,"" just a more human side than we got in her slices of life.  Didn't she have any flaws, any times she was really ready to give up on her writing career when it took so long to take off?  The few times she was profane or sad, she still seemed so polished.

Amy Adams did well in her role as blogger Julie Powell, and I didn't find her character as unlikeable as some reviewers have.  It's just that alongside Julia Child herself, it's not easy for a blogger emulating Julia Child to hold up her end of the story.  The intercutting hurts the story's momentum--each time Child's story gets rolling, we have to cut back to Julie Powell's sad little life in Queens, NY.

Finally, Powell's story gets a little self-referential as her writing career takes off, a fact that film cheekily acknowledges by saying in the end credits, ""Julie Powell's book was made into a film.""  I almost expected to see Amy Adams as Powell sitting in a development meeting at the end.

Overall, I definitely recommend the film, which is Nora Ephron's best work since&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sleepless-in-Seattle/dp/B0000AOV4I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sleepless in Seattle</a>&nbsp;(screenwriter/director) and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/When-Harry-Met-Sally/dp/B000XJD33O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">When Harry Met Sally...</a>(screenplay).

The setting and costumes are convincing. Ephron, the screen play writer/director, handled the back and forth time changes with clever bridges and honest attention to both.

Cons: Julie's character is not very likable. I kept wanting those parts of the movie to hurry up so we could get back to Julia's parts.
