Shot on 3/4 inch Umatic video production from super-producer Lionel Shenken and his prolific Emmeritus productions, the film is a serial killer story about a cab driver falsely accused of murdering a young couple. Slickly produced, earnestly written, and well acted, Body Count really grabs you from the beginning. with Jonathan Potts stealing the show as the troubled young man with a shocking past. Not surprisingly, he would go on to a long acting career in both Canadian films and horror genre flicks, one of the few Shenken players to do so. Featuring Ontario license plates, Canadian currency and local accents, this is a serial killer movie that is refreshingly Canadian. Starring Jonathan Potts, James Knapp and James Lukie. Directed by Lionel Shenken.",1188777600,2,835,5.192592592592592
