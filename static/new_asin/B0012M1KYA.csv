3092203,5,B0012M1KYA,"This document is a compassionate film about the most misunderstood disease in the world. Even though patients were discouraged from having children, my brother and I were fortunate to have two patients as our parents.
My mother would not speak to anyone about her life. Sally Squires was able to draw her story out with respect and understanding. My father trusted her to tell the story without fear of sensationalism.
Anyone who sees this film will come away with a better understanding of what it means when the doctors says you have leprosy.

I had no idea that leprosy -- and a hospital where victims of the disease were forced to go -- existed in the United States, let alone in the Louisiana bayou.  The beautiful footage and heartfelt sound track by Bela Fleck make it a really amazing journey into an untold history.",1207267200,11,321,4.631578947368421

8246811,5,B0012M1KYA,"As someone who lives and works in the other settlement for patients with Hansen's Disease in the United States, Kalaupapa - Hawaii, I had a keen interest in this film.  Many of our resident patients have spent time at the facility in Carville and this film helps give depth to the stories I have heard about this location. Like patients here, their patients have endured suffering and isolation unfamiliar to most in our country. This was a beautiful telling of the story of Carville and I appreciate the honesty of the film maker in sharing all aspects of the story of the patients of Carville.
