4653565,1,B005CHHX0G,"I've been waiting forever you know! All yesterday when I heard the news I was desperately searching for a dvd of my little pony. Apparently there was a lot of them so I decided to narrow my search five minutes ago. Saved so much time. Anyways you get a whole two episodes! Wait what? Well at least it's at the affordable price of 27.99. With that you could what? Buy a whole volume set of any cartoon ever (animaniacs is 21.99 for the entire first volume) and with this you get two great episodes of friendship is magic. I think we know what the better deal is.

The episodes in particular are the ticket master and suited for success.

In ticket master Twilight gets two tickets too a really awesome place and everypony wants to go. But only two tickets oh no! Disappointing someone even once is heinous and must be avoided at all costs. And um. That's it really. Will twilight go and somehow bring her friends or will she refuse to go and not show up at all? It's definitely a wild ride!

Did you know that 27.99 divided by two is 14.00? That episode cost you 14.00 dollars. Money well spent. You could have bought 14 apps for your ipad but I'm sure ticket masters has far more replay value.

In suited for success Rarity makes everyone a dress. Three words. Everyone's a critic. Four words. Always trust a professional. 12 words. How do you put on clothes if you don't have any fingers? I dunno but that's what that episode is about! 14.00 dollars!

You should buy these now so you can feel like a complete fool for when the whole collection comes out at around this same price. (although judging from the prices of the toys and this dvd expect that collection to be 60 bucks)

Buy one today!",1317254400,90,1695,4.382165605095541
4653566,4,B005CHHX0G,"I can't speak for the quality of the actual product, casing and packaging, but as for the show inside of it, it's great. MLP: Friendship is Magic is one of the best cartoons on the air right now. Executively produced by Lauren Faust of ""Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends"" fame, the show's humor hits great chords with everyone I have gotten to watch. And I mean everyone. Unless they went in biased against enjoying it, and even sometimes if they were, I have never met a single person, male or female, kid, teenager, or adult, who didn't enjoy the show after an episode.
Episodes 3 and 14, the two episodes featured here, are two of my favorites as well.
Episode 3, ""The Ticket Master"", has Twilight Sparkle being given two tickets to the Grand Galloping Gala, the best party in all of Equestria. Her problem? Who of her 5 best friends to give the second ticket to. Twilight learns that blessings are great, but if there aren't enough blessings to go around, it can make everybody jealous, while her friends learn not to pressure a friend into doing something.
Episode 14, ""Suited for Success"", has Twilight's friend Rarity, the local fashionista, in her quest to produce 6 dresses for her best friends and herself. Her plight throughout the episode resonates with creatives everywhere forced to practice their trade for a living, and also reflects upon the actions of her friends, who learn not to complain about a gift freely given, or as Twilight so punnily puts it, ""Never look a gift horse in the mouth.""
This show is great for the whole family, and even for those outside a family. I can't wait for the entire show to come out on DVD so I can have my own copy, as such I'm not getting them piecemeal like this. I throughly recommend the show to anybody, the happiness is nearly infectious.",1317254400,3,1798,4.621875
4653577,5,B005CHHX0G,"There are some good and bad things about this dvd. Some cons; it's only two episodes and quite frankly I would have liked it to have included The best night ever, as that episode is the conclusion of what the ticket master and suited for success lead up too. It's also a bit pricey, I got mine for $20 before shipping and handling.

However, there are good reasons to buy the dvd as well, and in my opinion they outweigh the cons. For one, Hasbro has not announced any plans for season box sets, on the contrary they have said that at the moment it would not be good business sense to do so. Now Hasbro could very well simply be waiting for their themed dvd's to sell before they release season box sets so as to make more money. However, that's all speculation at the moment and as for now no plans are in place for season box sets. I know that many people (including me) are unhappy about this because we want all the episodes in chronological order, but we can't do much about that. The only thing we can do is to show Hasbro it will be good business sense to sell season box sets. The way to do that is to support the show with our money. That is the main reason I recommend buying this dvd.

And yes, I know you can buy the episodes on itunes but I prefer to have my dvd's in physical form. That and I don't do business with itunes anymore.

The way I see it I want season box sets. Hasbro wants to make money, and I want all the episodes of my little pony friendship is magic. $20 seems like a small price to pay for two episodes if it may help encourage Hasbro to see that season box sets will be worth their time and money.",1332720000,,1631,4.106583072100314
4653578,5,B005CHHX0G,"It came quickly, my daughter and I are very happy with the DVD! I would definitly recommend this DVD to others, thank you very much!",1330905600,2,132,4.32
4653579,4,B005CHHX0G,"This series was a hit with 3 of my children.  I did, in fact, pick it up at Target not realizing that there was a price premium for buying it on Amazon.  Who knew.  There are a lot of negative reviews of this product that I don't quite understand, but the price of this video is probably the motivation for the critics here.  My advice: buy it at Target and be your own judge.  Most pony fans will be delighted.",1325980800,2,411,4.0875
4653580,1,B005CHHX0G,"Don't get me wrong... I do watch the show, like it, probably more then I should be willing to admit, but 25 bucks for a dvd with 2 episodes for the express purpose of selling toys? Hello, releases a dvd set, 25 bucks is ridiculous for a 2 episode release which includes a commercial.",1325116800,3,283,4.2592592592592595
4653581,1,B005CHHX0G,"I've seen this at Target for about $15, and I feel ashamed they even made it. It has all of TWO random episodes, one of which, the Ticket Master, has been enthusiastically packaged singly with a lot of the single pony toys. So if you got any of those, you're getting one episode.
The show is fantastic and well worth watching, but wait for a full season release. We got this for Xmas and returned it to get more pony toys. This DVD is not even worth $5.",1324944000,4,453,4.159090909090909
4653582,3,B005CHHX0G,"Before you jump to conclusions, I'm not criticizing the show, just the DVD in general.  I am aware that there are many people who love this show (mostly bronies), but I only recommend buying this short DVD if you are seriously a die-hard fan, or just rushing to give somebody a holiday/birthday present.

As far as my knowledge goes, a Complete Season One set has been confirmed, and there's a small screenshot of the front cover during this YouTube video (skip ahead to 3:00), [...]

Now I don't know when the release date is, but it's definetely going to happen.  For now, though, don't waste $30 on only 2 episodes; just settle for reruns on The Hub.",1321315200,2,653,4.555555555555555

so buy it!",1320278400,2,360,3.9452054794520546
4653584,1,B005CHHX0G,"If you must buy it, go to the source. Still outrageously overpriced but less than half what it is here. To add insult to injury, we got a free DVD from TrU that has The Ticketmaster on it! What are Hasbro/Hub/Corporate Greedbots thinking? They can't be making enough money on this to offset the ill will they are creating.",1317772800,3,322,4.47457627118644
4653585,4,B005CHHX0G,"I've enjoyed My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic for a while and I'm finally glad it's made its way to DVD.  Before I go into depth there are a few pointers I want to add.

1.  This is a Target exclusive DVD.  It's hard to see in the given images unless zoomed in.  In other words unless it is sold from Target directly the Amazon Marketplace is open to whatever prices sellers are willing to put out there.
2.  Not all Target stores carry it.
3.  This DVD is meant to compliment the Celebration at Canterlot toys...It is a standalone product (i.e. not bundled with a playset) but to me it just seems to benefit from the related toys (which I probably won't get).

With that said I bought the DVD just to have those two episodes in a physical media.  It begins with a short commercial for itself focusing on The Hub and after that has a simple menu screen of either playing either episode or both.  I didn't expect much from it to be honest and the only thing inside the DVD case is the DVD (no miscellaneous stuff).  Since I tested it on a computer that was in pieces I didn't come across any subtitle options.

Outside of the two season's two part episodes the only continuity (as of writing) are three episodes: The Ticket Master, Suited For Success and The Best Night Ever.  This DVD only has the first two.

The Ticket Master (Season 1; Episode 3):  Princess Celestia sends Twilight Sparkle only two tickets to the annual Grand Galloping Gala.  It quickly bothers Twilight because she can't decide which friend to give the other ticket to.

Suited For Success (Season 1; Episode 14): While Rarity is getting ready to make her own dress for the Grand Galloping Gala she is interrupted by Twilight and Applejack.  Quickly Rarity decides to make dresses for her friends but ends up getting herself into more than she'd imagined and nopony is happy.

After thinking about it for quite some time I've figured that The Best Night Ever really isn't suitable for the DVD.  Since the DVD is meant to go along with the Celebration at Canterlot toys only enough information is presented to get to know the six ponies and little about the gala.  My assumption is that the toys are meant to let the kids visualize their own Grand Galloping Gala in any way they want.  The other point is that for those that have watched The Best Night Ever...I'd rather not spoil it but to put it simply the context/lesson portrayed is different than what is intended for the Celebration at Canterlot.

The last points I can think of is that both the packaging and the DVD are marked ""Made is USA"" which is a small plus.  The second is that there aren't any technical issues with the DVDs in terms of picture or sound (minus a small distortion in Suited for Success but then again not sure if it's just the awry hardware).  The third and last point is that this has two 22 minute episodes giving it a 44 minute run time.  Value wise it's OK although as a TV show this DVD could use more.",1317600000,26,2962,4.4288354898336415
4653586,1,B005CHHX0G,"This review is not about the series, it's great, but this release.

ATTENTION!

This Release only consists of TWO EPISODES of the 26 Episodes from the first Season.

Total running time is about 45 minutes. By this price you would pay 40$ for one hour of film (Would be about 70$ for a Hollywood Blockbuster!!!)

8465487,3,B005CHHX0G,"I keep hoping they'll release the entire season 1 on DVD so my daughter and I can enjoy the show together in front of the tv. Unfortunately the only other (legal) options out there are a few dvd's with a couple episodes each or downloading on iTunes for $40-$50 per season.

Instead with this DVD(which is widely available at Target stores everywhere for $9.99 I beleive) you get a whopping 2 episodes. Ticket Master and Suited for Success. The funny thing is, Ticket Master comes free with any of the basic MLP:FiM figures, which are about $6 - you only get one episode, but for almost half the price plus a figure.

I gave it 3 stars for the sole fact its a good show, but the merchandise isn't worth the cost.",1333411200,,712,4.386363636363637
