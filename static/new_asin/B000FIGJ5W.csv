2566864,5,B000FIGJ5W,"I just watched this DVD three times back to back.  I am a pole dance instructor and I found it invaluable to take me back to basic principles of pole safety.  It's easy to understand and contains more information than similar instructional DVDs.  It's definitely the first DVD I'll recommend to my beginning students who want to practice at home.  With the plentiful amount of tricks demonstrated, my students will have lots of material to master. This is the best way for women to play safe on the pole.  Way to go Shawn!",1150243200,,522,4.56989247311828
8122889,5,B000FIGJ5W,"I was very impressed with the instruction. All of the moves are broken down step-by-step, sometimes in slow motion, and sometimes with the video paused to show detail. It's easy to follow. She not only teaches several different types of spins, but also transitions, such as sexy ways to get up off the floor from a sitting, kneeling, or laying position. There are some short suggested combinations at the end of the DVD, but I found I didn't really need them. As I played with some of spins and ended up on the floor it was easy from that point to use one of the transition moves to get myself up and walking around the pole again. She does show some intermediate moves, but even with just the beginner moves, there is plenty of material to put together a decent routine.

Some people had posted that it seems low budget. At the beginning of the video, she explains that she made this video primarily as a teaching tool for her students to take home and work on moves in-between classes. Yes, there are no flashing lights, or cool graphics, but the instruction is top-notch, which is what I was looking for.",1260144000,,1107,4.507462686567164
8122890,2,B000FIGJ5W,"Have to say I was a little disappointed in this dvd.  The quality was not very good, almost looked like a homemade video.  And I was surprised that the 3 routines at the end were so short.  I had taken a class and was expecting longer routines.  She does go over safety very well, as well as showing you each move.  But I don't think it was worth the price.",1235692800,,357,4.042857142857143
8122891,3,B000FIGJ5W,Its to slow! Not what I expected. But it does show some good moves that you can turn into better ones  :),1235433600,,105,3.772727272727273
8122892,3,B000FIGJ5W,"I took lessons for a month and stopped going to class. I ordered this dvd to possibly keep me sharp on technique and maybe learn something new. It is an ok dvd for a total beginner but I think the demo dvd I recieved with my X-Pole was better because she had a person there who was a newbie and she demonstrated the moves for her and allowed her to try them herself. This gave you a clear veiw of mistakes you could make and how to correct them.

It could just be me. Im more of a hands on kind of person and I like to have someone there to answer questions and show me where Im making mistakes. If you want to learn to pole dance my best suggestion would be to find a class. You'll get more progress and better technique that way. If that isn't possible I would suggest you try out K.T. Coates dvds instead.",1232409600,,808,4.05
8122893,5,B000FIGJ5W,"This is the best beginner video for content on the market.  I am an instructor and have all of the videos.  Most pole dance videos are full of fluff and just 'show' you how to do the spin or move.  There is no true instruction in most of the videos out there.  This video actually teaches!  What a concept.

Although it is low budget I would take content over form any day!  The point of the video is to learn to pole dance not to watch for visual entertainment. The instructor has beautiful movement quality and is someone you can trust learning from.

Definitely a wise purchase,

8122894,3,B000FIGJ5W,"Sorry to say but I was disappointed with this DVD. The quality itself was really bad. MAybe I just got a bad copy of a DVD but also the way the material was presented did not appeal to me. Not the fitness and instructional value(really good) but the overall presentation (looks very low budget). Shawn covers a lot of spins and pole dancing moves in comparison to other stuff out there. She moves very well and I am sure she is a great dancer. I wish the DVD would have a bonus material where you could actually see her freestyle. There is always something you may find useful for  your practice but I find it too expensive for what is has to offer. If the DVD was for like $15, even $20 then I would not mind but it cost over 30!!!",1206662400,,732,4.154929577464789
8122895,5,B000FIGJ5W,I bought this video and Pole Katz at the same time...this one is by far the best out of the two.  There are lots more diffrent tricks/spins/floor work than the Pole Katz video.  There are tricks for the begginer and for the more advanced.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS ONE!!!!,1202428800,,271,4.489795918367347
8122896,5,B000FIGJ5W,This is my favorite video!  Great warms ups very informative and great instruction!,1181174400,,83,5.384615384615385
8122897,5,B000FIGJ5W,This is a great video for anyone wanting to learn to poledance.  She breaks down the moves so they are easy to learn.  You learn how to make your moves look fluid so everything can come together in a sensual way.  Shawn puts some combinations together at the end which is nice although I don't think it would be hard to come up with your own because of all the great moves included in this DVD.  I can't wait for the second DVD to come out!,1172016000,,440,4.0813953488372094
8122898,5,B000FIGJ5W,"Shawn focus on safety is great. PoleCats 1 is easy to follow and navigate. Basic Dance Moves, Safety, Climbing and Inverting that is what you get. What Shawn teaches in this DVD is what she teaches in her Pole 1 classes. I bought this DVD after I took classes from Shawn so I won't forget what I learned. I not only could practice the pole ticks that I learned, but learn new ones.  Can't wait into Shawn comes out with more DVD's. Former Student Cynthia",1155168000,,454,4.341176470588235
