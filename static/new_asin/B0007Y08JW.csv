2249092,5,B0007Y08JW,"Cheers was one of the great all time sit-coms that unfortunately seems to have not aged very well with viewers.  While other shows like Seinfeld continue to be ratings juggernauts in re-runs, Cheers has lost a bit of that lustre and I'm not really sure why.  With great writing and great performances Cheers always delivered the laughs and the ratings.  This show finished in the Nielsen Top 10 eight times including SEVEN top 5 finishes.  That's really incredible.  Season five was notable for one big event which was Shelly Long leaving the show in the last episode of the season, paving the way for Kirstie Alley in Season six.  Season Five would begin with dueling wedding proposals between Sam and Diane and end with the pair finally set to marry until Diane gets a book offer.

Favorite season five episodes include:

1) The proposal - Sam finally proposes to Diane romantically aboard a boat.  When Diane turns him down Sam makes her walk the plank.

2) Thanksgiving orphans - One of the all-time great Cheers episodes as the gang gathers at Carla's house for Thanksgiving Dinner that takes all night to cook and ends up in a hilarious food fight featuring the only appearance of Norm's wife Vera as she is totally covered in food.

3) Everyone Imitates art.  Sam gets a poem published in a magazine that has rejected Diane's work a number of times and she is sure that he stole the poem from somewhere and is determined to find out.

4) Never Love a Goalie - Carla starts dating a Pro hockey goalie named Eddie (Jay Thomas) but as soon as they start dating, Eddie starts playing terribly.

5) Dinner at Eight-ish.  Frasier and Lilith invite Sam and Diane over for dinner but things go awry when Lilith finds out that Frasier  and Diane used to date.

6) Norm's First Hurrah.  Norm brags about getting a great job as an accountant with a top company but when the gang surprises him at work, things are not exactly as norm described.

7) Simon Says - The Great John Cleese plays a noted marriage Counselor who says Sam and Diane are not meant for each other which so upsets Diane that she continues to pester him.  Hilarious episode!

8)  I do and Adieu - Diane's leaves Sam when they are finally ready to be married.

To be honest I always preferred Kirstie Alley over Shelly long so I was not all that upset to see Diane leave.  But there are lots of great episodes in this season that would lead into the final six season which I truly loved.",1116201600,5,2451,4.5181818181818185
2249093,5,B0007Y08JW,"One of the greatest television comedies in history, Cheers is an absolute ""must see"" for anyone who's ever had a regular hangout ""where everybody knows your name"". The shows centers itself around the friendly neighborhood Boston bar named Cheers. The bar is owned by former Boston Red Sox relief pitcher Sam Malone (Ted Danson). Sam has three employees - bartender Woody Boyd (Woody Harrelson) and waitresses Carla Tortelli (Rhea Pearlman) and Diane Chambers (Shelley Long). Noted psychiatrist Dr. Frasier Crane (Kelsey Grammar) and his wife Dr. Lilith Sternin Crane (Bebe Neuwirth) are regulars at the bar (with Grammar later starring in his own series spin-off, Frasier). Regular barflies Norm Peterson (George Wendt) and Cliff Clavin (John Ratzenberger) round out a strong supporting cast.

The Cheers (Season 5) DVD offers a number of hilarious episodes including the season premiere in which the audience discovers that Sam's marriage proposal from the previous year's season finale was directed at Diane. However, Diane feels that Sam is on the rebound from Janet, so she declines - requesting a more romantic setting for their engagement. When Sam proposes on a boat, Diane turns him down again then spends several episodes attempting to get Sam to propose once again. Meanwhile, Carla falls in love with Boston Bruins goalie Eddie LeBec (Jay Thomas) and John Cleese makes a guest appearance as a famous marriage counselor and friend of Frasier Crane. The season ends with Diane leaving Sam at the altar in order to finish a novel a publishing house is interested in...

2249094,5,B0007Y08JW,"I love Cheers. Its my favorite show of all time! The Diane years are my favorite. But the seasons after her departure are classic too, don't get me wrong, but i think Cheers is at its best with Diane. This is her final season, and boy, did she leave it with a bang. An absolutely classic show, and yet another phenominal season of Cheers on dvd. There are too many classic episodes to name, but here's a couple, when Sam councils Dianes' reservations at that expensive restaurant, and takes his date there instead. Hilarious! And when the dog bites Cliff, and he thinks she really likes him, but of course she is just trying to get out of being sued by Cliffie. A laugh riot! There are atleast like 15 more I can think of, but I can't list them all here. I got the first 4 seasons the day they came out, and I'm gonna get the 5th season the day it comes out as well.",1113091200,4,866,4.191616766467066

2249096,5,B0007Y08JW,"If Paramount decides to put any extras on this set, this is what they should include:

Interviews with Ted Danson, Rhea Perlman, George Wendt, Glen & Les Charles, James Burrows talking about Shelley Long's final season.  Maybe have Shelley herself talk about it, too.

Show the alternate ending of ""I Do, Adieu"", the one that was taped before the audience and have commentary on it.
Also have commentary on the episode itself by either the Charles brothers or James Burrows.

They could also show bloopers from Season 5.  They should have done that with all of the other seasons.  They only did it for Season 2, though.

Those are just some suggestions, that's all.  But I don't think Paramount will put any extras on here.  They didn't with the 4th season set.",1112745600,3,761,4.704545454545454

2249417,5,B0007Y08JW,"I'll still have to give Season 5 of Cheers 5 stars because it's still funnier than anything else out there, but if I could take off half of a star, I would, because the first half of the season has always been my least favorite. How well I remember the uncomfortable feeling I got as a kid watching a woman who used to be plucky and independent morph into a whining desperado constantly begging for scraps of affection from an apparently disinterested man. Yes, we're talking about Sam and Diane here. Sam spends the four seasons before this hotly pursuing her, only to throw her over when she turns down his marriage proposal in a moment of anxiety because he had, literally, just gotten out of a relationship the night before.

While it's not surprising that commitmentphobic Sam goes back to his usual mixed emotional signals, the writers for some reason decided to take Diane, who up until then had been so independent that she insisted on working in a bar rather than living off her wealthy parents, and make her marriage obsessed - and willing to delude and debase herself constantly in an effort to get a few crumbs of attention from Sam. I really don't know what the writers were thinking here - maybe they felt that this was the only approach to use with a lifetime bachelor like Sam - just wear him down drip by drip.

Finally, he comes around and asks Diane to marry him in the middle of the season (at this point, he need only crook his finger at her and she flies into his arms). I had remembered their engagement as kind of annoying, but re-watching it as an adult proved me wrong. The engagement provides some of the show's most classic episodes (the one where Diane tosses Sam's ring out of the car; the one where Diane jumps out of the bachelor party cake and then offers Sam 24-hours of hedonistic pleasure with other women, which he blows because he'd rather spy on Diane; the one where the whole gang end their Thanksgiving meal with an epic food fight).

Additionally, we finally get to Sam in a mode other than womanizing cad - what's he like when he actually cares for a woman? He appears a bit beaten down about it - suddenly losing the spring in his step and adopting a rather hang-dog expression - but I don't know if this was a deliberate acting choice on Ted Danson's part, or if Danson was just tired from filming a series for five years.

However, I must commend Danson on his acting skills - check out 'Chambers vs. Malone' when they're in court and Diane gives a defeated speech about not being able to figure out their relationship - and in the midst of it, Sam changes his mind about not wanting to marry her - it's all done with a look of admiration and love suddenly settling into his eyes.

Shelley Long is more calcified and almost a parody of herself in this later episodes - she still retains some of the vulnerability that made her so appealing in the earlier seasons, but there is no doubt that she's simply become more grating on the whole. Perhaps dating Sam for four years will do that to a girl.

However, I really enjoyed their engagement - here is a couple who have learned to deal with their basic personality differences - and compromise enough to make the relationship work while still getting in teasing and needling that make them so attractive to each other. Sure, Sam has to pick out china patterns and a dust ruffle - but Diane agrees to go to DisneyWorld for their honeymoon. They seem well on their way to a fun, passionate and loving- if  challenging marriage (provided Sam can keep it in his pants). [A word of warning to young ladies watching this series: Guys like this don't change in real life!]

Too bad Shelley Long left, but I get the feeling the writers wouldn't have let them be married anyway. I think they'd gotten it into their heads that the series depended on the two always being apart. Perhaps shows about less-than-perfect marriages weren't the norm then like they seem to be now.

The last episode, where Diane takes off from the ceremony to go to be a writer, and there's a flash of them dancing as they might have if they'd grown old together, is heartbreaking. Especially when you know that Sam is destined to spend the next 6 seasons being nothing but a dumb doofus who chases around after a gold digger.

I guess like most of us early Cheers fans out there, I'll have to rewrite the ending in my fantasies.",1447891200,3,4389,4.475

2249476,2,B0007Y08JW,"Mid way through Season 4 the wheels were coming off of this show, unfortunately. More and more jokes leaving the realm of reality and simply falling flat. You start to wonder where the laughing is coming from, because it's certainly not from what's occurring on screen. Woody's innocent charm has dissipated into grating idiocy, but he still has his moments. The constant barrage of cheap sexual innuendo is wearing extremely thin at this point, and fails to amuse more often than not. Sam's ego is rampant and annoying, and quite frankly he's turned into a sleazy cad with the occasional good intention. I know it's a favorite of many and a ""timeless classic"", but it never regained the fame and popularity it had with Coach. They should have called it quite after this season, but nope-too much money to be had I guess. This isn't gonna be a popular opinion or review, but it's mine. Seasons 1-3 are all you need, unless of course you're a collector or like Woody's character and one lame sex joke after another. Some humanity emerges of course at stages with the cast's personal problems, but the depth of emotion is lacking from the humor that captivated in the early years.",1428969600,,1178,4.723300970873787

2249478,5,B0007Y08JW,"In the Cheers episode, ""Everyone Imitates Art"", Sam is in the rare position of being in complete control when Diane receives a rejection letter from a poetry magazine and calls it a subtle suggestion for her to submit poetry again. Sam insists that it is a form letter and says that he could get the same letter back if he sent in a poem. ""You turn every defeat into a victory,"" he tells Diane. In an attempt to bring her down a peg from her airy literary hopes, Sam does submit a poem and it is published in the poetry review. This turn of events rocks Diane to her core and she begins to question her talent and her real destiny in life. Though comic, Sam's behavior could be seen as sadistic as he lets Diane twist with self criticism and doubt for a long time before coming clean with his poem's true origin.

Sam enjoys his little game to the hilt and as he watches Diane question her whole life in her disappointment. When Woody gets back the same form letter as Diane's, he takes pride in it. As Diane accepts the truth about her rejection letter, Woody says, ""I'm framing mine!"" I will not give away the ending here but Shelley Long is again great  to watch. I love the scene when she frantically enters the bar with an armload of books as she attempts to find the poem that Sam sent to the magazine. She does not wear her usual stylish and feminine clothes. She wears jeans, a baggy shirt and a scarf laced casually around her neck like a long suffering artist. She takes a pot of coffee to a table and works feverishly as she smokes. Frasier says, ""Diane, you don't smoke."" She looks up and replies, ""What's your point?""

As Diane fails to find what she thinks is the plagiarized poem, she takes a hard look at herself by acknowledging that others in the bar surely see her as, ""..a pretentious, self deluded windbag and apparently, you've all been right,""  she says. When she learns the true source of the poem, Diane's hopes and artistic pretensions are resurrected. Shelley Long's performance in this episode is especially good and the real connection that Sam and Diane share behind all of the insults, coyness and evasion is finally revealed in the most endearing way possible. This was a fantastic script by Heide Perlman. Her skill in this one is almost beyond description. If you want to laugh and be truly delighted, watch or re watch this episode.",1421884800,,2367,4.48491879350348

2249822,4,B0007Y08JW,"For its first four seasons, Cheers was an almost flawless series. But at the beginning of season five, a number of factors conspired to create a seriously bumpy start. For one, there is an evident tension in the air directed at Shelley Long. Whereas in earlier seasons, Ted Danson and Shelley Long would be smiling into each others eyes in almost every scene (that special magic chemistry they had), here Danson, as well as the rest of the cast, can barely bring themselves to make eye contact with her at all. Perhaps the tension came from Shelley Long's attempts to remove Kelsey Grammar from the show, or perhaps it was the inklings that Long might ""abandon"" Cheers - and maybe sink it in the process. The impossible-to-conceal bad vibes are highly evident in the first batch of episodes, and effectively kill the magic between the two leads.

Secondly, for the first time ever, the Cheers writers made a serious mistake. For the first four seasons, the back and forth tension between Diane and Sam was played just right - stretching the rubber band, but never breaking it. But, in the first episode, by making Diane reject Sam's proposal, they wrote themselves into a temporary corner. Now, Sam was forced to play angry and grumpy (which just doesn't work) and Diane was morphed into a love-struck undignified idiot (which works even less and seriously cheapens the character). In other words, Sam just wanted Diane to go away, while Diane was hopelessly in love with him. That wasn't the kind of sparring or sexual tension that had made Cheers so wonderful in previous years. In fact, it is downright awkward to watch. Of course Sam loves Diane - she is his only salvation from becoming an ageing and ever more lonely Lothario. It is evident that this turn threw Ted Danson, as Sam just doesn't feel in character for those early episodes doing little more than looking angry. In fact, this was a shift in Sam's characterisation that never really went away right to the end of Cheers - in order to be able to lose the character of Diane, Sam was made to no longer really care. That was a mistake. The old dynamic: The neurotic intellectual who needed to just chill out a bit and the ageing stud who needed to stop running away from himself was shelved forever. ""I am the best thing that could have happened to you!"" Diane one screamed at Sam. And ever since Sam met Diane, he once told her, he has begun thinking and caring about stuff - even reading War & Peace. Now, the producer's dislike of Shelley Long slowly killed that whole dynamic, and in the eyes of this reviewer, cheapened the show forever.

Thirdly, this was the year that the famously bad Eighties aesthetics finally caught up with the show. Shelley Long is given an appalling mullet hairstyle, big shoulder-pads and pale unflattering clothing. It may seem like a small thing, but it looks dreadful. In previous years, Long's hair was beautiful as was her clothing, but the season 5 look just adds to the caricature of the idiot love-struck Diane. When Long ties her hair back in a few episodes, it is amazing how much better (and more like Diane) she looks. One suspects that many of these factors may again have been sub-conscious attempts by the writers and producers to sabotage the role of Diane to make it easier to continue the show without her. And the tension in the air was evidently so bad that they had to write an episode where the entire cast has a huge food fight!

Thankfully, the almost unwatchable grumpy Sam and idiot love-sick Diane concept is diluted by the episode ""Everyone Imitates Art"" (It might be best to skip all season 5 shows before that) - in which we finally get a very touching sense again that Sam really does care about Diane (he has saved every letter she ever wrote him). And after that, the season kicks off again (evidently, things were patched up with Shelley Long, as around here, the cast start making eye-contact with the actress again and Danson starts grinning at her in that magical way once more) but it never really climbs to the highs of the first four seasons.

Some of these missteps perhaps helped contribute to the later held idea that Long's Diane was ""spent"" and that it was better for her to leave and the series start afresh. It is true that the Diane in the early episodes of this season is unbearable to watch - but then again so is Sam. Some Cheers fans feel that the post-Long Kirstie Alley years cheapened the character of Sam Malone by regressing the additional dimensions that someone like Diane offered him and that the great Cheers magic was never really re-captured after Shelley Long left. Of course, there is no way that Sam and Diane could have not gotten married and Diane remained on the show. That too would likely have snapped the rubber band and seriously eroded credibility, not to mention viewer patience. But Cheers was a show that took risks (like when polling told the writers to get Sam and Diane together asap, and instead they upped the tension by having Diane date Frasier in season 3) - so perhaps in this spirit, had Shelley Long stayed on, the writers would have thumbed their noses at the conventional wisdom that suggests that marriage would effectively kill the Sam Diane dynamic. Marriage would have enabled Diane to have a rational reason for staying at Cheers as a co-owner. She could have annoyed Sam with her poetry nights and attempts to bring in an upper-class crowd. They still could have had the usual fights and even separations. But we'll never know. Yes, Shelley Long made a huge career mistake by leaving the show - both Ted Danson and Kirstie Alley developed successful film careers while remaining behind the bar at Cheers, while Shelley Long faded away somewhat, which is a shame as she is truly an outstanding actress of the first degree.

In the final episode of the entire series - in season 11 - Diane returns, but again the writer's bitterness at Long hasn't fully dissipated. Now, Sam and Diane agree that they were basically just good in bed together and little more. Is that what made Cheers fans love the show in the first four years? Again, Diane is cheapened and through that so is Sam and so is Cheers.

Anyway, season five has a very, very disappointing start, but eventually picks up, albeit not to the standards of the first four seasons. However, the final goodbye episode with the lovely Shelley Long is very touching.",1240272000,6,6410,4.658127208480566
2249823,5,B0007Y08JW,"It's hard to decided on a star rating for this season.  In terms of hilarity, I found Seasons 3 and 4 funnier - and those were utterly hilarious seasons.  Season 5 is imperitive though for anyone following the Sam and Diane romance as it ties up ends that had been in the making for a long time (namely the prior 4 seasons) so it will be essential to anyone following the series.  While this season is funny and entertaining without a doubt, it doesn't score as high in laughs as previous seasons, and one reason for that is the preoccupation with Sam and Diane's impending marriage. However, while this season perhaps did not quite meet previous season levels of gut laughs, there are many moments of real thought provoking drama, proving again that while Cheers was a comedy, it was also a show of some depth in the issues that it non-chalantly tackled.  Perhaps it was the right time for Shelley Long to leave the show, but seeing her leave in that final episode was somewhat like saying a last goodbye to an old friend.  Diane as a character was obviously not without her faults, but in spite of those, she brought in concepts of higher education, literature, poetry, the arts - AND vanity, snobbery, and pretentiousness - how much more fodder could a character bring to a show?

In previous seasons Diane often vasicilated between sexy and cute and vain and high-brow, but in this season she truly reaches an apex of exasperating self-centeredness that will leave the viewer almost crying out at more than one of her stunts!  She usually manages to relent at last, or is it Sam's easy-going nature that brings things back into the realm of stomachability.  I'd not like this season alone to stand as full representation for her character.  But even so, I found that at the end of the season, she'd more or less won me over again - well, I wouldn't want to marry her ;) - but to tell you the truth, it seemed to me that finally Sam stopped the wedding.  You'll have to judge for yourself.  In reality, Long had decided already that season 5 would be her last even though producers had offered her ridiculously high amounts of money for her to continue.  Whether it was for spending more time with her kids, or to pursue a movie career, Long left after this season.  I've yet to go back through the Rebecca shows on DVD and am looking forward to it, but as I grew up with the Diane era myself, these first 5 seasons are more or less gold for me.  All of the characters in this show are unique and form an incredibly varied yet cohesive unit.  I'd give this season 4.5 stars in terms of humour.  In terms of 'the saga', it's indispensable.",1236038400,,2641,4.482254697286012

2249872,4,B0007Y08JW,"While Cheers continued on for another six seasons after this fifth season, for many fans of the show, it ended when Shelley Long's character Diane Chambers walked out of the Boston bar for the final time as Ted Danson's Sam Malone watched her leave, knowing she would never come back.

The chemistry between Sam and Diane is what really drove this comedy for the first five seasons that it was on the air. The two actors were truly in sync and their back and forth banter and will they or won't they romance that was on and off countless times during the five years, was something that has not been captured on television many times since.

While Long left the show, as I mentioned, the show continued on for another six years, with Kirstie Alley essentially taking over for Long. While Alley's Rebecca Howe and Sam had good chemistry, it was tough to live up to what had come before with Sam and Diane.

Season four ended with Sam proposing to Diane and we pick up in season five as she rejects him, then quickly changes her mind. Of course, once he was rejected, Sam decided it was over and didn't want to take her back until midway through the season when they finally officially got proposed, while Sam was in court after Diane brought him there on assault charges. As the season drew to a close, the marriage was still planned, but Sam knew better as he said his goodbyes as the door closed behind her for the last time as a cast regular.

While this season marked the final regular cast appearance by Long, it was the first season as a regular cast member for Kelsey Grammer as Dr. Frasier Crane. Dr. Crane was a recurring character for most of the previous seasons, but it was this year that his name came in the opening credits. In this season he becomes serious with the woman who would eventually become his ex-wife, Dr. Lilith Sternin, portrayed absolutely fabulously by the great Bebe Neuwirth. The two move in together and a dinner with Sam and Diane brings out some former relationship secrets that Frasier never shared with his new love.

Bar employees Cara Tortelli and Woody Boyd (Rhea Perlman and Woody Harrelson) continue to make life in Cheers enjoyable for everyone with their great humor. While Perlman's humor is more on the cynical, biting side, Harrelson comes across as the innocent youngster who just never seems to say the right thing. A highlight episode in this season was the famous ""Thanksgiving Orphans"" episode, where the Cheers gang gathers at Carla's for Turkey Day and the evening ends with a massive food fight. This was one of the best episodes of the season, and quite possibly of the series, at least in my mind.

Bar flies Cliff Clavin and Norm Peterson (John Ratzenberger and George Wendt) seem to live in Cheers, but in this season you get  a glimpse of their lives outside of the bar. Mailman Cliff falls for a woman whose dog bit him and she uses his feelings to help get the lawsuit dropped. Norm gets a new job with an accounting firm and everyone gets a glimpse into his life as they take a look at his new ""office"". Also, for the first time, we get to see Norm's wife Vera, but she is obscured a little. In the Thanksgiving Orphans episode, she shows up at Carla's and immediately gets hit in the face with a pie, so viewers still have no idea just what Vera is like.

The only bad thing about this set is the same as with the fourth season. The set has absolutely no extras, which is disappointing, as it would have been great to hear what things were like behind the scenes in Long's last year. But beyond that, this season set featured a lot of great episodes.

As a youngster, I enjoyed the final few seasons of Cheers, but I never realized just how fantastic this show was with Shelley Long and Ted Danson's chemistry in the early years. As far as this show goes, this season was certainly a great one, but at the same time, a tough one as the hole left by Long was a big one.",1124064000,21,3931,4.456189151599443

CHEERS will always be remembered as the comedy series that broke away from the formulas of old and ushered in a new era of style in the way comedies was done.

The only reason I give Season Five 4 stars is because the series was a bit in a rut at this point, bogged down in the Sam and Diane = Marriage storyline that grew old and monotonous.

If Shelly Long had not left the show when she did, CHEERS may have never become as great as it did.

I liked Shelly Long in Seasons 1-4, but by the 5th season the Sam & Diane see-saw romance stories were getting a bit stale.

They were recently voted #6 in the TV Land Countdown for Best TV Couple!!  I think they should have at least made the top 3  :)

Although it was sad to see Diane leave ,, Kirsty Alley did a wonderful job filling the void ..creating a different chemistry with the show !

However, I must note .. a few reviews said that Diane's last appearence was in Season 5 ..this is not true !!  For all of you fans ... she does reappear in the Series 3 Part Finale in Season 11.

Here is a little list of the last 3 episodes .. featuring Diane.

Episode # 273 - ""One for the Road, Part I""
The gang sees Diane winning a Cable ACE award on TV. Sam calls Diane and invites her to Cheers. Don asks Rebecca to marry him, but she can't say yes.

Episode # 274 - ""One for the Road, Part II""
Rebecca poses as Sam's wife for a double date with Diane and her husband, Reed. Don interrupts the date and asks Rebecca to marry him. She says yes. Reed admits he is not married to Diane. Sam and Diane decide to get married.

Episode # 275 - ""One for the Road, Part III (Series Finale)""
Sam announces he is leaving Cheers to start a new life in California with Diane, but at the airport, they decide not to marry. Sam returns to Cheers.

 ~*~* In short this is a CLASSIC TV show with excellent writing paired with a Great Cast that had on air chemistry. It will no doubt stand the test of TV Time and be around 50 years from now .. as ancestor shows like I love Lucy and The Honeymooners. ~*~** These 2 shows are merely mentioned to give examples of TV shows that are still around 50 years later ..as I suspect Cheers will be !",1118361600,,1751,4.081871345029239
