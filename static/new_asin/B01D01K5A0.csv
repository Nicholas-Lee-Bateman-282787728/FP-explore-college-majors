8754478,5,B01D01K5A0,"I pre-ordered this DVD last April and it  was a long wait but more than worth it. First, let me be clear that this is by no means the best film or video of RG available. It is taken from a (I believe) Spanish television show. My clue for that is that Rory says, ""Gracias,"" along with his other English ""Thank Yous. This is the bad from the remarkable rockumentary ""Irish Tour: '74, i.e., RG on guitar and vocals, Gerry McAvoy on bass, Rod D'Ath on drums and Lou Martin on keyboards.  Let me start by giving you the song list, since it is not provided on the product page:
1. Messin' With the Kid
2. Tattoo'ed Lady
3. Garbage Man
4. Cradle Rock
5. Young Fashioned Ways
6. A Million Miles Away
7. Walk on Hot Coals
To any RG fan of long standing, such as myself, this is all material available on CD or DVD and in the case of the Videos, better visual and sound quality for sure. During my first viewing there was a brief bit of static on the sound on the first song, ""Messin' With the Kid."" I thought I was going to regret my purchase. That turns out to be the only glitch in an otherwise high quality soundtrack.
So, it it's all stuff we've heard and scene else where, and this is a black and white film, do I rate it five stars?
I gave it five stars because, in my opinion, these are among the best performances of the material I have ever heard. Only seven songs and yet it runs 100 minutes. There is a lot of Rory's lead and slide guitar and extended solos by Lou Martin. ""Cradle Rock"" seques into ""Young Fashioned Ways,"" an up tempo blues shuffle that I have not heard anywhere else. It makes this DVD unique.
The production values, I believe, are the best they can be under the circumstances. Picture and sound quality are between good and excellent through out the disc.
I must caution that the final song, ""Walk On Hot Coals"" is roaring along and ends abruptly. I don't know why and, at first, I was a tad pi***d. Then I realized that someone(s) had worked very hard to rescue as much as they could of this remarkable performance by the band. So, with that caveat, I give this DVD my highest recommendation. I feel I must ad that I am an extremely avid fan of this musician who was taken from us so early in his life, and I will grab for anything I don't have, especially video, unless warned off by other fans in their reviews.",1476489600,7,2335,4.221476510067114
