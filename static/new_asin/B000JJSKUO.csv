There were actually some humorous parts in it, although I didn't know if they were intended to be funny. There's some blood, but not too gory. Worth watching, in my opinion, just don't expect much.",1329868800,4,283,4.568627450980392
8151307,3,B000JJSKUO,"In typical annual fashion the Sid brothers tend to dedicate all their October film viewings to the horror genre out of respect for all it's brought us over the years. Even if a great action comes our way we'll typically keep it on the back burner until the month closes out. So at first when we came across Death Row there was first a shock that a movie of this grade even exists, followed by excitement seeing that it actually falls under the B horror umbrella in some respect. Never really thought we would get to do a horror movie with Joe Esteves and Todd Bridges at the same time. Especially one where Joe plays the convict and Todd Gak plays the corrections officer...seems a bit like bizzaro world but we're just fine with that.

Right off the bat you receive your confirmation that yes the budget couldn't have been more the a singular twenty dollar bills worth. Among 8 prisoners getting out to clean up an abandoned prison for the day is non other then B legend Joe Estevez. The constant bewildered look on Joe's face could only leave us wondering if he even knew he was acting in a movie. It's almost as if someone tore him out of his esplenad hotel room mid slumber and dropped him off on the movie set. His hair was all over as he just starred blankly for the first half of the movie as if he was really working off a serious $2 bottle of whiskey hangover. However when Joe finally came back to life his performance was electric. The man has acting powers beyond human understanding....this is a fact Martin Sheen could never get past.

Now that we've reached the conclusion of this review you may be wondering why there was no brief synopsis? Well the reason is quite simple...there was no plot to give a brief summary of. The film stumbles around in an absolute clumsy state of disrepair with no hope of ever being anything legitimate. Naturally this was not an issue for the brothers Sid but may be an issue for the rest of normal society. Well lets face it, if you're a normal member of society there isn't a chance you'd even know about this film let alone who the mighty Joe Estevez is. However if you are a lover of all things B then you should get enough laughs just watching a painfully confused Joe Estevez wander aimlessly on the set for an hour and a half. He really just looks like a short deranged old man without a clue. Awesome!",1287360000,,2357,4.4036697247706424
