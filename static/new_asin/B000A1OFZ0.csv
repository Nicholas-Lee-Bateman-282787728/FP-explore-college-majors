2350255,2,B000A1OFZ0,"A nice story, but not historically accurate. The attempt to link Nero to Christian Theological may be a bit much in Nero's case.  Also, Caligula reigned for about 3 years, this story infers that Caligula had about a 10 year reign.  Nevertheless, it's a fair work of fiction. The DVD Caligula, may be more accurate -- hope you could stomach it, esp. the unrated version.",1129507200,7,369,4.661538461538462
2350256,1,B000A1OFZ0,"And again, Hollyweird takes some liberties w/the story. The effort at humanizing Nero is a valiant effort, but falls short. The love-affair w/a slave girl is lacking in any chemistry at all, not to mention the clumsy insertion of Nero's marriage against all odds to a Greek slave (which of course, never happened).

In the movie, Nero's mother, Agrippinilla, is exiled for conspiring against Caligula, when according to history, the exile was due to her wild, decadent excesses. The movie has Nero raised among slaves (incorrect), exiled Agrippinilla to a distant island for 10 years (incorrect again), proposes marriage to a slave (incorrect yet again), has Caligula rule for over 10 years (incorrect again! What a surprise!).
The marriage to Octavia wasn't dissolved because of Nero's desire to wed Acte, but to wed his mistress, Poppaea Sabina
There are actual historical references (making his horse a consul, prostituting senators' wives), so some effort was made.
Whoever wrote this awful thing should be FORCED to take a course in history.  The movie is littered with efforts to portray Nero as an agonized soul, struggling with his environment for the good of humanity.
The entire movie attempts to elevate Nero above his horrid, bloodthirsty, decadent track record.  Gone are the wild excesses, the debauchery, and the inhuman cruelties Nero was reknowned for. Instead, he is portrayed as a sensitive, noble soul who battles against all odds to help humanity, rebukes cruelty, and loses everything.
The final hour devolves into a bad documercial for Christianity. The slave girl Acte goes from a minor historical role to a pivotal one in this religious effort to revise history. The truth is that Christianity is what caused the Roman Empire's decline: more resources were devoted to religion than to maintenance of state, from Constantine to Theodosius.
The actors playing Agrippinilla and Seneca were quite good: the rest of the cast stunk.",1126742400,10,1951,5.1873015873015875
2350257,2,B000A1OFZ0,"Here's a quick guide for fans of ancient Rome.

If you like action sagas (""Gladiator"" or ""Ben Hur""), you won't like this. It's long, drawn out, and the action is minimal. There are no battles.

If you like somewhat historically accurate accounts (""I, Claudius""), you won't like this either.  It's not chronologically accurate and the writer takes a lot of dramatic liberties with character motivations.

If you like titillating adventures exploring the debauchery and wild-side of ancient Rome (""Caligula"" or HBO's ""Rome"") you really won't like this.  There is little blood, the few murders are quick and clean, and you'll see more sex on network TV.

However, if you like long, slow, romantic movies where an all-encompassing love story is fabricated from little historical evidence and made into the primary driving force in Nero's life (even more so than his mother's influence), this is the movie for you!  This movie largely ignores the juicy bits of Nero's life and turns him into some lovesick sap that gets all weepy because he can't have his true love.

I swear...if I ever have to endure one more 5 minute long scene of Nero and Acte (his love) gazing longingly into one another's eyes telling each other how heartbroken they are, I will start looking for a sword to fall on.  Don't be fooled by the reputation of historical Nero in regards to this movie. This movie should have aired on The Lifetime Channel.",1126742400,11,1419,4.854771784232365
2350258,3,B000A1OFZ0,"Much of the pleasure of watching a Roman epic is getting away from modernity to an age when the most awesome thing you could encounter was a rearing horse, and nights were utterly silent, broken only by the sound of lyres and tambors. Nero takes you into such a world, and conveys the tragedy of the very young Nero (17 when he took office), manipulated into power by his mother. For several years, his rule was benign, but after the army destroyed his household for him, he turned to drugs and sex and Hitlerian visionary schemes. He is said to have crucified countless Christians, blaming them for setting Rome ablaze. Left utterly alone, he ignominiously took his own life. A powerful drama of the empire verging on chaos.",1126396800,4,725,4.671875
2350259,4,B000A1OFZ0,"The miniseries made of television that examines the highlights of the Roman Empire ('Imperium: Augustus' was the first).  While the sets and costumes and flavor and atmosphere of that phenomenal period in history is well captured and the production qualities are strong, the historical accuracy is diminished by 'cleaning up' the facts and rearranging dates and incidents to make a 'Hollywood version' of the Roman Empire.

Given the fact that this is not a biopic but rather an entertainment, IMPERIUM: NERO is interesting, if long at 192 minutes, to watch in continuity.  Nero was born in 37 AD and died in 68 AD and during those 31 years much changed in Rome.  We first met Nero as a child 'abolished' to a life with the slaves by the infighting among the Emperors - Caligula (John Simm) and Claudius (Massimo Dapporto) - and the Senate - namely Porridus (Simn Andreu), Burrus (Maurizio Donadoni), and Septimus (Ian Richardson).  While living among the people we are informed that Nero (a fine Hans Matheson) falls in love with commoner slave Acte (Rike Schmid) and when misdeeds in Rome call him back to power (through the wily and devious guidance of his mother Agrippina (Laura Morante, the true star of this film), Nero is forced to marry well and forswear his love for Acte.  Once proclaimed Emperor, Nero does some bad things such as having his brother Britannicus (Francesco Venditti) killed, etc and begins to descend into madness instead of fulfilling his vision of creating an empire for the people. His teachers include wise Seneca (Matthias Habich) and  commoner Etius (Jochen Horst) and his loyal friends include  Tegellinus (Mario Opinato).  Once on his downward spiral Nero begins to murder and destroy those close to him and finally burns the city of Rome to prepare the ground for his grand palace and city, all the while playing on is lyre.

If this all sounds wicked and cruel, then it is probably better that the story didn't 'flesh out' the true obese, schizophrenic, megalomaniacal, sexually dysfunctional creature that was Nero.  You need the history books to see what a hideous tyrant he was, a man who placed his acting and circus skills above all else, castrating young boys who resembled his mother to marry while also marrying the prostitute Poppea (Elisa Tovati).  But the major problem with this version of Nero's tenure is the emphasis on the new sect called Christians.  Indeed, even the apostle Paul is brought in to cleanse the proceedings and seep evangelicalism into the story to help it end!

But for the script as written (by Paul Billing  and Francesco Contaldo) director Paul Marcus brings off a fascinating though long image of the Roman Empire.  Not for Roman scholars perhaps, but for those who enjoy historically based epics, this NERO should do nicely  Grady Harp, September 05",1126396800,21,2825,4.9261603375527425
2350260,2,B000A1OFZ0,"Obviously, the description amazon gives of this movie is the wrong movie description.  This is an historical drama about the Roman emperor Nero.  It suffers from not knowing whether Nero was a bad guy or a good guy gone astray and spends most of its time developing a silly romance that comes entirely from the not very fertile imagination of the writers and none at all from history.  Production values are generally high with some good acting at times, but the script is plain silly.  I wrote another review of this for amazon that they never posted, so I won't go into all the details of why it is silly again.  Suffice it to say the writers would have been better to follow the historical facts and forget trying to use their imaginations.",1126224000,6,743,4.556390977443609
2350261,3,B000A1OFZ0,"NERO, a name from my young school days ,history books told me about it and later in Seminary I had to study on
him more deeper ways since his relation with Roman Christians. Nero was all the considered a mad, disturbed,crazy king and he was. Because he kills his own mother, aunt and his senator who ever came to question him Nero killed them without mercy. looks like murder and romance was his hobby.
This movie filmed in Tunisia brings lots of nice outdoor scenery and of course it is gorgeous. I am glad that stories with Roman Christians are added here and Paul of Tarsus is pictured here and burning of Rome and all the blames on Christians. This was AD 64-65 Nero persecuted christian and some where later he killed apostle Paul too.

2350264,3,B000A1OFZ0,"I actually purchased this movie because I admire Hans Matheson's work. He's quite a brilliant actor and I was eager to see how well he'd do in a movie about Rome. While I have to agree with most of the reviews that the movie really does butcher history, I still have to say it was overall enjoyable and Hans was pretty amazing. His emotions, his heated outbursts, his expressions - they won me over. So I don't regret buying it and I'm a history buff myself but I don't mind accepting that this movie is just something to enjoy, not to focus on the accurate details of history.

2350265,3,B000A1OFZ0,"Nero was one of the most infamous Caesars in the history of Rome. Many scholars have debated his madness, his reason, and whether or not he truly set the fires that burned down most of the city. This film is based somewhat on his life and the circumstances behind those he held account against, but the timeline is badly off the truth, and the actual story would have made for more compelling filmmaking.

When his father is found guilty of planning crimes against the monarchy, Nero's young life is placed in peril by the insane emperor, Caligula (John Simm) in order to force his mother (Laura Morante) into revealing her participation. Rather than see her son slain, Agrippina confesses what she knew of the plot. As punishment, her son is taken from her and sent to be raised among slaves, while she is banished to a deserted island where she may never again do harm to her family. The years pass and Nero (Hans Matheson) has grown into an adventurous young man, passionately in love with the beautiful Acte (Rike Schmid). The laws of the empire govern that a slave cannot be lawfully wed to a free man, and thus she can never be more than his concubine. Her Christian father forbids this. Caligula is murdered in torrid circumstances, leaving the empire to be governed by his uncle, Claudius (Massimo Dapporto). Believing Agrippina and her son have been treated unfairly, he returns them to the court. Agrippina has seen a vision that implies her son will one day rule the empire, and plots to bring him into power.

The senate, in the meantime, insulted beneath Caligula's brutal reign, have become disillusioned with the Caesars. History unfolds to reveal the path that takes Nero far from his beloved Acte and into the halls of Rome, where he is slowly corrupted by deception and hatred for what he cannot understand, as Christianity spreads through the civilized world.

There is much to like about this production, however poor in its history. The odd thing about it is that some of the facts are correct but others have been fabricated. It would work much better if the timeline were not off by fifteen or twenty years. Nero's life has been sanitized, leaving out his perverse sexual practices, penchant for sadism, and numerous attempts to viciously murder his mother. How he comes about evil acts in the movie seem to imply he either had nothing to do with it, or was forced into it in self-defense. The story implies that had he merely been able to marry his childhood love, Nero would have turned out all right. Still, the costuming is absolutely gorgeous and it was a joy for me to see all of the characters I know so well from my studies breathed into life, from Nero's tormented first wife to Senator Septimus (Ian Richardson). I enjoyed seeing the infamous moment when Caligula lead a horse into the senate and informed the senators that there was a new senator among them.

I was also surprised with how much faith was put into the film. There is some paganism early on, when Agrippina has a vision of a soothsayer who tells her all Nero will accomplish, but through the second half Christianity takes precedence. There is even the appearance of Paul, who teaches in the underground church, sends out letters to his fellow believers throughout the empire, and baptizes followers in the name of Jesus. Nero sends for Paul, having heard that he is capable of rising people from the dead. Acte becomes converted, and later attempts to influence an unfeeling Nero to share her point of view. But even then, there was a little something lacking in the production. Perhaps it was passion, for the whole thing felt slow and less than enthusiastic about its purpose.

If one is capable of overlooking the historical deficiencies, Nero is actually a decent film. I was pleasantly surprised with the religious turns it took in the second half, but would have appreciated a bit more passion from its participants. I also feel that it might have been more compelling had not Nero been made to seem relatively harmless. That Acte was in love with an evil man against her will would have made for better storytelling.",1332374400,,4123,4.728789986091794

2350267,3,B000A1OFZ0,"WARNING: SOME SPOILERS FOR THE SETUP OF THE MOVIE.  Nero is a piece of ""revisionist history"" that attempts to view the much-reviled Roman Emperor Nero in a more sympathetic light.  However, in order to do this, they change certain historical details.  Either that or the makers of this piece strongly disagree with mainstream historians about how Nero's father died, how old Nero was when his mother was exiled, and the manner of his first wife's death.  In this piece, Nero grows up with a whopping great case of post traumatic stress due to the fact that, as a child of about age 6 or 7, he witnessed his father being murdered, was himself threatened by the emperor Caligula with a knife, saw his father's head on a platter, and watched his distraught and overfond mother get sent off into exile. Caligula sends young Nero to be raised by his aunt, who decides he ought to be raised by slave farmers in case Caligula changes his mind and decides to kill Nero after all.

Nero knows some happiness with his slave friends despite some obvious residual psychological problems, such as becoming manic and panicky when the love of his life, the virtuous slave farmgirl Acte, initially refuses his hand because she doesn't want to be an illegal wife/concubine; patricians couldn't marry slaves, apparently. Still, it looks like he and Acte have a shot at True Love and all of the joy it brings until Caligula is assassinated, Claudius becomes emperor, and Claudius decides to bring the teenaged Nero and his beautiful but creepy mother back from exile.  The Mom, Agrippina, has changed for the worse in exile; she is determined that her son should be emperor no matter what the cost, and is also determined to snuggle with him every chance she gets. Eww.

The rest of the work details Nero's rise to power and fall from grace.  Initially determined to be the world's first kind, just and nice emperor who makes the common people happy and keeps the peace, forces around him, such as Creepy Mom and his simultaneously idealistic and cynical tutor, push him over the edge into the madness that you suspected was there all along.

Nero is played by Hans Matheson (Archbishop Cranmer on the Tudors, Lord Coward in the recent hit Sherlock Holmes) in a style similar to that of Joaquin Phoenix as tragically crazy emperor Commodus in Gladiator.  At first he seems miscast, as he was in his late 20s (at least) when he appeared in this piece, and the young, new Emperor Nero is just 16.  But he fits better into his role as the teenager becomes a man.  Matheson's achievement in this piece is that he kept me on his side no matter what awful deeds he committed later in his life, because I always knew what drove him to that point, and at his lowest points he appeared to be suffering the tortures of the damned. Another standout performance is the actor who portrayed Caligula, an evil-and-loving it character, a foil to Nero's wants-to-be-nice-but-can't, sorrowful lunatic.  The actress who plays Acte does a fine job except that I suspect her dialogue was dubbed by another actress (due to her resume I suspect she might have had a German accent that might have been anachronistic in a piece set in Italy in which everyone speaks with English accents).  However, the early scenes between Nero and Acte are sappy in a Hallmark TV movie of the week sort of way, with too much sweet sunniness and hair-tearing lover's agony.  ""Nero"" is at its best when the young emperor is struggling with the political realities of Rome, trying to be the perfect, ideal, humanistic king and gradually becoming the tyrant that most Roman emperors were, and hating himself for it.  Worth renting, but ff through the sap.",1287619200,,3692,4.7274143302180685

2350269,1,B000A1OFZ0,"This should have been an epic film.  There was alot of good acting and story line but it just wasn't accurate.  No historian would validate just about any of this movie.

The names of the ""characters"" were all that was done right here.  It was if the story of Nero was a play written hundreds of years ago that the director could take ""artistic liberity"" with and ""spice it up a bit.""  The end result was absurdity as Acte (a barely worthwhile mention by Roman historians) became the prominent figure in the story.  It is a fact that Nero trapped his audiences in the amphitheatres while he was performing and no one was allowed to leave.  The film portrays his music as something the Romans were proud of.  They weren't.  It was an embarrasment to them just as much as it was when Commodus dressed up as a gladiator.  Nero was also a sexual pervert which the movie did not explore.  He had sex with his own mother and raped the Vestial Virgin Rubria as well as married a young boy who took the role of ""the man"" in their relationship.  He also had another boy castrated to be ""the woman"" in that one.

Known for his tortures, he was thankfully removed from this world with force by his own people before he was successful in having a man from Egypt who ate people alive arrive in Rome possibly to kill Christians and anyone who Nero felt threatened by.

Nero was a MASSIVE spender of the wealth of Rome as much as he was a MASSIVE thief of the peoples' money.  He would steal land to have it stripped and then rebuilt on.  He had plans to rename Rome ""Neropolis"" and the month of April to ""Neroneus.""  He was a self-obsessed egomaniac who this film did not reprsent and then asked us to feel sorry for him - even forgiving him.

And Claudius' wife a good woman in the movie?!?!?!?!?  WHAT?!?!?!?!?  She was the most poisonous bile duct of Claudius' reign!  JSLDFJOI@EJR@J!!!!!  The movie turned her into a saint!

This film should give hope to those who idolize Hitler.  If you make a movie about someone who the world knows is one of the worst humans to ever live and you put a spin on it to portray them as a victim, people will actually buy it.  In fact, the leader of Iran says that the holocaust never happened.  Am I saying the director of this film agrees Hitler is good or that the holocaust never happpend?  But what the director is technically doing is saying that Nero didn't happen.  At least not the historical one.",1214179200,3,2429,4.385650224215246
2350270,5,B000A1OFZ0,"When studying the childhood of serial-killers and mass-murderes, deemed society monsters, we discover that often times, earlier events occurred that molded and drastically transformed an individual, who later grew up to become a sociopath deprieved of feelings or conscience.

I gave this movie a 5 Stars rating because it was will written and well made. It gives us a glance at the succession of drastic events, that could have possibly transformed the child Nero, into the well known tyrant that history chastises. Most historical texts accentuate the evil acts of the 5th Roman Emperor, without exploring in dept how this young child became to be such an evil person in later years.

I rest assure that this movie does not profess to be 100% historically accurate and may surely be challenged by knowledgeable historians, but still it bears a certain degree of truth and reality, based on what we know today, on the psychological profiles of mass-murderers and serial-killers.

One can argue that had the young Nero as a child, placed in much different surroundings and faced with different life experiences, as he was growing up, would most likely have turned up to be a far different adult.

However, I could rate it no higher than 2 stars because of how altered and almost sanctified the portrayal of Nero's life and reign actually were. I mean, from what I've always read...he was always nuts, not only persecuted Christians but declared himself the enemy of God, etc. Here, we're forced to believe that he was some sort of victim and succombed to the pressure of bad choices only to be ""redeemed"" in the end. Entertaining...yet a highly inaccurate portrayal of a tyrant and one of the 1st century church's most bloodthirsty persecutors.

2350272,2,B000A1OFZ0,"What a curious motion picture.  ""Nero"" filmed in Tunisia (2004) portrays a completely fictitious Roman emperor.

Raised by slaves, betrayed by his closest friends and advisors, and loved by all, the perennially young Nero (he's 20 something through the whole flick!) gradually looses his way through various unconvincing plot turns and twists.  In the end, he commits suicide (this at least is historically accurate) in his one love-wife-concubine's arms (this is fiction).

One wonders through this movie- why the revision of Nero?  Is there really a contemporary need to put a good face on this crazed emperor after 2000 years?  In deed, the final line of this fairy tale encourages this revisionist effort, ""Let us forgive him, as we hope to be forgiven"" (perhaps an apt self-disclosure for Neronian socio-paths!).

The DVD is beautiful filmed.  Tunisia remains a forbidding and mysterious place (like Rome itself).  The costuming here is vibrant, interesting, and reflects accurately the period.  One tastes the dust and feels the heat in each scene.

The actors give this odd screenplay an Herculean effort.  Unfortunately, the flick offers no casting list, so it is impossible to sing the laurels of anyone's particular effort.  One hopes the stunning actress playing Nero's mother will win more roles in the future.  Her beautiful and murderous ""Agrippina"" should have been award winning (she's dreamy in an evil way).  Also, the philosopher-politician Seneca is brilliantly played.  This actor has become Nero's tutor for me.

I truly appreciate the way the story unfolds at a deliberate pace without rushing too much or dragging too much.  Wardrobing deserves special acknowledgement both for the Roman soldiers and for the opulent nobles. I rated this movie pretty highly because compared to other endeavors at dramatizing Roman times... I felt this one came off a bit more believably.  I was also surprised by the strong dose of Christianity in the film. . . and I would argue that the dialogue delivered by the Apostle Paul was too reliant on passages from his epistles.

2350275,1,B000A1OFZ0,"I've seen a lot of Neros, he is usually portrayed as the pouty little Ack Tor with anger management issues as in Quo Vadis, but I have to say, this movie presents him in a whole new light, bit player in a really bad story of Acte.  If you're looking for a movie with a decent portrayal of Nero that takes into account all the evidence available and from there, attempts to build as accurate and equitable a depiction as we can expect nearly 2,000 years later, it hasn't been made yet.  If you're looking for a film about how an imperial freedwoman probably never acted, this is it.  This little flick is so far off the mark, one could quite feasibly consider it a comedy, a Saturday Night Live take on ancient Rome.

Some of the historical inaccuracies that had me rolling: Senators in Birkenstocks and Nike tube socks?  Senators wore half-boots, Bagely Mischka did not design Poppaea's clothes, and Martha Stewart 700 thread count Egyptian cotton sheets are a realatively new thing, if I'm not mistaken.  But I could have lived with all that if not for the gross historical inaccuracies.  At the time of Agrippina's first exile, Nero was a toddler.  Ahenobarbus died of gout in a quiet little villa in the Campania region, not murder in front of tiny little Nero who, had Ahenobarbus truly died before Agrippina's exile, would have been all of three.  Agrippina's second exile ended in 49, making Nero 11 years old as he was born in late December and not yet 12 at the time of her recall.  This would make Acte a pervert, even by ancient Roman standards.  Acte the christian?  That's about as likely as Seneca getting his philosophical ideas from Paul of Tarsus.  I won't even go into detail about the terrible portrayal of Claudius, but I gotta say, I about fell out of my chair laughing with the, ""I'm a cripple, not spineless,"" line.  All in all, what came to mind while watching this movie is that the guys at the BBC need to turn off the Oxygen Network and crack a history book.",1166140800,13,1984,4.5210084033613445
2350276,4,B000A1OFZ0,"I wish I could give this movie an 'A' rating because there is a lot I like about it.  However, while it purports to be historical, it gives the impression that Nero was some sort of torn, jumbled man wanting more equality for the people but driven in a different direction by politics beyond his control.  While he may have been split in his desires for Rome, history shows him to have been a brutal man who would even kill his family members for power and who was the first to persecute the Christians of the Roman Empire.

Separating the actual history from this fiction, the story is an amazing story reflecting the message of early Christianity.  Thus, this becomes more of a religious story than an historical account of Nero's life.  In this story, Nero is sent to live with a family of slaves from the age of six to sixteen, where he learns of their lives firsthand.  He learns the need for more equality among people and, when he becomes Emperor, he is determined to better the lives of the ordinary people.  The 'establishment' frustrates his efforts at every turn, and this leaves Nero feeling very stymied.

Also frustrating Nero is the fact that he loves a slave girl, Acte, but he cannot marry her for political and social reasons.  Acte, after being sent back to her family, becomes a Christian and is baptized by St. Paul.  The movie shows her praying, seeking guidance on how she should be in order to influence Nero.  Also, after Rome was burnt and Nero went after the Christians, a young Christian girl is killed . . . . but raised from the dead by St. Paul.  So, their faith in strengthened to better be able to face the persecution.

The movie implies that Nero's wife died of some internal problem (such as appendicitis) when in reality he angrily kicked her and her unborn baby so hard it killed her.  So, in the movie he calls for St. Paul to bring her back to life.  Paul, aware that it isn't God's will, refuses.  Consequently, he is killed.  In the end, Nero becomes so frustrated and depressed, he commits suicide.  Acte, who saw him going by to a place they loved to visit, follows, but too late.  She ends the movie by asking that Nero be forgiven as Christians hope to also be forgiven for their sins.

For historians, this movie is certainly errant; for Christians or other people of faith, this can be a very inspiring movie depiction of the life early Christians lived and the world in which the lived.",1157414400,7,2435,4.503416856492027
2350277,4,B000A1OFZ0,"Many reviewers here argue from the premise that there is a historically accurate Nero and Neronian Rome from which the film has deviated.  It should be emphasized that none of the historical sources from which we read accounts of Nero are particularly trustworthy.  As an informed Wikipedian writes in the article on Nero, ""It is worth noting that these assumptions of [Nero's] behaviour are based entirely on hostile sources; namely Suetonius, Dion Cassius and Tacitus. Nero's life was documented almost entirely by his primary rivals- the senatorial class who were pro-Flavian.""  Additionally, of these sources, only Tacitus's Annals is contemporary to Nero's reign.  Suetonius, author of the Twelve Caesars, was born three years after Nero died.  Dio Cassius and Philostratus, who authored works which mention Nero, were born over a hundred years after the events they recount.  Additionally, the Book of Revelation has not helped Nero's reception.

I applaud the film for offering an alternative portrait of Nero as victim of circumstances.  It helps the non-historian understand that history is multifaceted.  Even when only one narrative survives, fiction can step in to help us imagine what others, like Nero, thought.",1155945600,7,1225,5.405263157894737

2350279,1,B000A1OFZ0,"At best, this film should be seen as an interesting failure ! There are so many glaring historic inaccuracies that, on the balance, this depiction of Nero and his reign comes off as complete fantasy - a fictional story that is very loosely based on the actual historic events. Although we can never know exactly what Nero thought, it is very hard to imagine this famous character as a misunderstood hero.

The Italians who filmed this dreadful mini-series at the same time as HBO filmed the dazzling series ""Rome"" should be thoroughly ashamed.

The sets are tasteful enough, but often quite obviously made of rough paper-mach or badly sculpted plastic, and most of the stone looks too obviously faux-painted.

The worst shock is the script, which appears to have been written by Christian fundamentalists. Nero is depicted as a love-struck teenager whose greatest failure in life is his failure to relate to the pure Christian girl who he first fell in love with. She figuratively and literally haunts his every action all through life, and he repeatedly states to her that she is the reason for everything he has done. This is as bad as the worst daytime soap-opera. The supporting characters are similarly overdrawn. They are also very prudish about depicting the violence and the utter abandon of the pagan Romans.

This long film (which is actually a six part mini-series compacted seamlessly into a single film over 3 hours long) is actually so bad that it is curious to see it, if only to compare it to better productions to notice everything that was done worse, to see  the few good performances, and to ponder the shamelessly biased viewpoints of the writers.

Nero attempts no such high pretensions.  Instead, we get a flagrantly revisionist story of ill-fated romance and heavy-handed intrigues with spatterings of historical references and ultimately a denouement of Christian apologia that seems an afterthought rather than part of the fabric of the scenario.  We're actually asked to feel sorry for and even ""forgive"" one whose reputation is that of being among history's most contemptible tyrants.  I suppose it's an interesting twist on conventional notions of who Nero actually was, if only we could be made to believe half of what's put forth here!

In this teleplay, Nero's (Hans Matheson) love interest from his youth, a lovely and angelic slave by the name of Acte (Rike Schmid), eventually identifies and becomes enmeshed with the Roman Christians who include Paul of Tarsus. The irony is thick, but contemporary history is not entirely clear on Nero's relationship with the early Christians in Rome.  The depiction of how Acte and Nero first come to know each other is best left for reconciliation with the film's writers since it defies written history.  The child Nero's father is shown to be assassinated by order of the mad emperor Caligula while his mother Agrippina the Younger is seized and exiled. While Agrippina's exile is believed to be true, the favorable characterization of the father and the depiction of his demise is pure fabrication.  Nero is spared and shown as being made a ward of Caligula's court, but also made to live among Acte's slave family and reaching young manhood among them.  While the young adult Acte has a very compelling presence and is an actual figure in history (she's found in the writings of Tacitus), she unfortunately is made a prominent female in this slice of made-up history that also includes the more notorious likes of Nero's conniving mother (returned from exile by emperor Claudius) and his second wife, the sultry and seductive Poppaea. Being a slave, Acte is only allowed to be a concubine of the patrician Nero; though this, too, is eventually worked around by the scenarists.  Methinks this mostly anecdotal dewy-eyed romance was chosen as the driving force and connecting thread of the narrative for the same reason James Cameron made a similar decision for his film Titantic; i.e., a nod to all class-conscious teenage romantics in the audience!

The tragic romantic ending is also pure fabrication.  A previous reviewer suggests that we're made to believe Nero wasn't the innate tyrant history makes him out to be, but instead suffered from nothing more nefarious than a broken heart.  It's a speculative way to help explain motivations behind certain of his more disreputable actions, but the lack of gravitas in the drama and lead performances precludes any sense of historical efficacy, something for which Roman history buffs watch these films!  What's perhaps also disturbing to history buffs is that no attempts are made to bring events and characters into chronological focus.  Historical timelines are purposely compressed; hence, on a subliminal level, events don't quite logically add up.  I'm sure running time and budgetary constraints had as much to do with this as anything else.

Among those events inexorably tied to Nero's legacy, the persecution of the Christians is depicted in one brief harrowing scene. The cause of the persecution is not what you may surmise, however! The famous burning of Rome and Nero's detached panoramic view of it are well-staged. The cause and effect of the fire are also handled more sensibly than is usual in movies. However, there are no battle scenes (Nero's reign was relatively peaceful on the frontier. Civil war commenced only upon his death with no viable heir to the throne) and the one gladiatorial scene in the arena is actually quite tame. (The DVD cover art shows a lion in the arena, but neither animals nor Christians are harmed, or even shown, in the making of this arena scene!)

From a technical standpoint, most of the shots and scenes are well-staged with a fine sense of composition, blocking, lighting, and costuming.  The same was true of Augustus, in which it seemed many of the same sets were used.  However, pursuant to my opening comment of this being a dour affair, many of the interiors during the second half of Nero are purposely underlit, supposedly to convey the dark changes and tortured meanderings within Nero's mind and soul.  This is severely overdone, almost to the point of exhaustion as the scenes lengthen, the pace slackens, and our interest wanes.  A more accomplished lead actor and director might have been able to pull this off more effectively.

Overall, Nero allows its protagonist to be a sober, sensitive, and troubled young individual as opposed to the entertainingly hambone performances put forth by the likes of Peter Ustinov in Quo Vadis? and Charles Laughton in The Sign of the Cross.  Unfortunately, a ""straight"" Nero is also a dull Nero.  Also for those who enjoyed Quo Vadis?, a notable absence from Nero's court is that of the poet Petronius.  Instead, the noted stoic philosopher Seneca is used prominantly as Nero's more learned foil. The early Christian angle is much better handled in the dramatically superior television mini-series A.D.

In Nero, I believe the producers wished to present something historically-based, speculative, and sympathetic to its subject; but unlike with Augustus, ultimately comes up short on the viability and entertainment fronts.  Hence, Nero is a two-star guilty pleasure with a gesture to the commandments: ""Thou shalt not bore"" and ""Thou shalt not infuse ancient history with excess sap"".",1139788800,35,6669,5.31083650190114
2350284,3,B000A1OFZ0,"What if you had to kill an innocent man, a member of your family, in order to safeguard your own life?  If you did kill him, what would it do to you?  These terrible questions were faced by the real-life Nero, when he was only seventeen.  His decision, and its long shadow, forms the focal point and center of this psychological character study of one of history's great villains.

Nearly every important event shown in this movie really did happen, although in the tradition of film-makers everywhere, chronological order and spacing of events are sometimes changed.  The core of the film is provided by the semi-fictional character of Acte, played by the bright and lovely Rike Schmid.  Acte serves both as Nero's conscience, and as a measuring stick by which the viewer can gauge Nero's descent from idealism to brutal action, then dissipation, and finally death.

Is Nero's personality accurately portrayed?  After two thousand years, it is impossible to say.  Yes, the movie is probably overly sympathetic to him, but conversely, his biographers Tacitus and Suetonius may have been too critical.  What held my fascination was his emotional transformation, driven by the appalling circumstances in which he found himself, and his responses to those circumstances.",1137888000,6,1267,5.136585365853659

2350288,3,B000A1OFZ0,"""Imperium: Nero"" is the second Italian mini-series devoted to the life of one of the early Roman emperors, following ""Imperium: Augustus.""  So we have the story of the first and fifth emperors, representing the beginning and end points of the Julio-Claudian dynasty.  We saw Tiberius in ""Augustus"" and both Caligula and Claudius reign in turn in ""Nero,"" but none of them get their own mini-series (My understanding is that there will be another four tales of the Imperium to be told in this manner, which will end up in the fifth century).  I was thinking that this was because Tiberius does not really do anything, Caligula was too much of a monster, and Claudius was already the subject of a celebrated BBC mini-series.  But while history considers the Emperor Nero to be as much of a monster as Caligula or Commodus, this 2004 mini-series does not.

You can have fun recounting all of the differences between the historical record and the screenplay written by Paul Billing and Francesco Contaldo, and others here have done as much.  All I want to focus on is the key change to be found here.  When Nero became Emperor at the age of 17 the Roman Empire enjoyed five-years of peace and prosperity, mainly because his mother Agrippina the younger, his tutor Seneca, and others effectively ruled in his stead.  But then Nero became bored with his wife, Octavia, and began an affair with Claudia Acte, a former slave.  That began the split between mother and son that eventually ended in Nero having Agrippina executed.

What we get in ""Nero"" is that Acte (Rike Schmid) is the slave girl next door that young Nero (Hans Matheson) falls in love with when he is sent to be raised on a farm after his mother (Laura Morante) is banished by Caligula (John Simm).  When Claudius (Massimo Dapporto) becomes emperor, Agrippina and Nero return to Rome, and Nero wants to take Acte with him.  But his mother will have none of that, because a meeting with a Soothsayer (Liz Smith) has told her that Nero would one day be emperor.  In a series of political machinations Agrippina because the new wife of Claudius and makes sure that not even the emperor's will can stand in the way of Nero assuming the throne.  As emperor Nero rules in his own name, but making Acte his wife proves beyond his powers.

Thus, ""Imperium: Nero"" becoems a tragic love story.  Boy loves girl, boy become emperor, boy loses girl, girl becomes Christian, boy has mother executed, Rome burns, boy plays lyre, so on and so forth.  Ultimately, this mini-series has a similar aim to the first one, which showed how Octavian became Augustus.  When young Nero is sent away, he is known as Lucius (his birth name was Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus, but he was commonly known as Nero Claudius Caesar Augustus Germanicus).  What we have here, then, is how Lucius became Nero, albeit with the explicit caveat that this is not a good transformation such as the one undergone by the divine Augustus.  Instead, we are supposed to accept the idea that Nero was an idealist, whose good intentions were undone by both a domineering mother and a cadre of disloyal Senators led by Septimus (Ian Richardson).  However, this story is also hampered by the fact that Matheson reduces the change to Lucius smiles and Nero cries in terms of his performance.

You know full well that this story is working on the soap opera level when Nero's persecution of the Christians happens not to scapegoats the believers for the great fire that decimates Rome (this is just an opportunity for Nero's dream of urban renewal), but because Paul of Tarsus (Pierre Vaneck) refuses to resurrect the Emperor's dead wife, Poppea (Elisa Tovati).  It seems Paul was sent to save Nero's soul (think Constantine a couple of centuries earlier), but before we really get into any significant Christian revisionism we get a final scene between Acte and Nero where he confirms that Lucius is long gone, and in the end we are coming dangerously close to covering the cinematically familiar ground of ""Quo Vaids.""  But the verdict here is not that Nero was a raving lunatic, but that rather than he had a broken heart and a shattered dream of a better Rome.  This would be a sad story if it were not such a pathetic representation of history.",1130544000,8,4251,4.727642276422764

2350290,1,B000A1OFZ0,"Let's see, where to start?

1.  Nero's parents call him ""Nero"" when he is a very young boy, but his birth name was Lucius Domitius, and he didn't style himself ""Nero"" until he was adopted by the Emperor Claudius.

2. In this film, Nero appears to come of age during the reign of the Emperor Caligula (who is called ""Caligula"" throughout the film, but was always referred to by his real name, Gaius, during his reign.) Problem is, Nero was only three years old when Gaius was assasinated.  Gaius only ruled for four years, but the film makes it seem like his reign was much longer.

3.  On the other hand, the reign of Claudius which followed lasted for 13 years, yet seems to be severely truncated in this film.  Nero doesnt age at all during the reign of Claudius.  In fact, Nero was only 16 years old when he became Emperor.

4.  Nero simply stops aging at some point in this film. He rules for fourteen years but does not seem to age a day.  Did this film even consult a makeup artist?

5. The plot to replace Nero with General Galba seems to be lifted straight out of Quo Vadis.  Actually, several Roman generals revolted against Nero's rule at about the same time, and Galba was merely the first to reach Rome to take the Purple. His reign lasted less than half a year.
