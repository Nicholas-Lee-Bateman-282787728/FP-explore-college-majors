8761207,4,B01FR356XU,"This six part TV series of Marsdens famous book is very welcome. Firstly though, it has some significant differences compared to the book and the relatively faithful film adaption of a few years ago. This is primarily due to the experiences of the families being explored in considerable detail. We also see a lot more of the enemy, so the extra screen time has been utilized to create a much fuller version of Marsdens teenage centric affair.

The exploration of what happens to the teens families is a real treat. A variety of scenarios are shown. We see them imprisoned at the fairground, now concentration camp, of course. They are worried for their kids and indeed often in the dark as to whether they are even still alive. There are also the invidious choices they have to make. Such is war. The series is richer for this perspective.

I was taken by the casting of the teens. Robyn is more like I pictured in the book. Fi is different again in looks and temperament but she works well too. Kevin, given he is the oldest character also gets a more realistic depiction. I liked them all in fact. They are also a bit more like regular teens than their counter-parts in the film. There are changes though, Chris is quite different and has a different journey. Ellie, as needed, is particularly well cast and played.

Again, there are significant differences to Marsdens original story. There are quite a few new developments and new angles on depictions from both those earlier formats. Some of the new pieces work very nicely, a couple less so, particularly a virtual rewrite of one key event. In some ways this is more realistic but some drama is lost.

Overall though, the fresh take is welcome and worthwhile. Still it is markedly different from the book at times but if you're not too hung-up about that, youll find this take very interesting and enjoyable. It is still meant for young adults, so there is violence but it is not excessive or gratuitous. The music is also a great feature. Roll on series 2! Highly Recommended.",1464652800,7,2034,4.657381615598886
