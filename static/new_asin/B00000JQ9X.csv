1236340,2,B00000JQ9X,"Younger children may enojy nuts talking and mice fighting the soldiers but all of this comes in way too long at 48min. I initially thought the Amazon Editorial Review by Doug Thomas was alittle harse but after watching this, it was kind. It may have had some chance at 22min (think of your favorite Christmas Special - most are for a 30min time slot - with the Rudolph classic set for 1hr). I knew Rudolph the Red Nose Reindeer and this is no Rudolph!",1323648000,,451,4.380952380952381

1236342,4,B00000JQ9X,"my 9 year old is autistic and saw the outside cover of the dvd, thinking it was a ""zucchini birthday party.""  so i had to purchase it.  now she sees that it is about alot of veggies, celebrating and just loves it.  thanks.",1292371200,,222,4.116279069767442
1236343,5,B00000JQ9X,"This is an adorable little movie. It is an updated version of ""The Nutcracker"", with assorted colorful characters and a Clara with 'Tude. I especially adored her; she was quite the scene stealer, if a cartoon character could possibly do that. Of course Phyllis Diller as the Fairy was a scream as well.  It is a refreshing take on a classic fairy tale, and one that children can relate to. The computer-generated graphics are amazing.
This is fun family fare for the holidays. I recorded it on VHS when it played on Primetime TV, so I'm glad the DVD is out. Even adults will find it entertaining and amusing. (...).",1133913600,6,615,4.590909090909091
1236344,4,B00000JQ9X,"If this was a movie meant for me, I wouldn't be able to rate it very highly. But my son has been watching it for over 2 years now. He doesn't just reserve it for the holidays, either. Every few months, he drags it out and watches it a bunch. In fact, it's mid-January now, and he's still watching it 2 or 3 times a day some days.

I really don't like it that much. It's certainly no ""Nemo!"" The music is a bit too gospel for me, and the story and animation are not spectacular. However, it has its moments.

The most important thing is that, out of all the Christmas movies we have, my son loves this one the best. His entertainment is the sole reason I bought the movie, so I have to give it two thumbs up. Besides, anything that brings my son so much joy has a special place in my heart.

The following is my son's own review:  ""The nuts are funny, the Mouse King dances with one of his army men, and some little red fruits have gas and stink up the whole place and make their own men and a lot of black-eyed peas have to go to the hospital.""

And there you have it!",1105747200,4,1068,3.995305164319249
1236345,5,B00000JQ9X,"We got a copy from the library and my daughter insisted we buy it!  I think she is destined for Broadway! she just loves acting out the mouse king and even created her own costume so she could march around the house like him!! We are going to see the Nutcracker play together now and she is sooo excited.  If this crazy movie can inspire an interest in plays and creative play on her own,,, I'm all for it!  My little boy is also crazy about it!  they are 4 and 2 yrs old.",1101600000,,472,3.9893617021276597
1236346,4,B00000JQ9X,"First, let me say that I ordered this movie by mistake.
I wanted to order more movies but I got this instead.
How are you supposed to get the movies you want?
Now I have the movie I want so I watch it. It is called the
World's nuttiest nutcracker. Which is why I bought this movie
because it's about world records for who is the nuttiest of all.
Let me repeat that I hate cchristmass. But I love movies about christmass. I don't have to deal with my own family because I hate them. So now I watch this movie and I like it like 4 stars out of 5, it is insane. There are all these people in the movie
that look like cheap plastic, but wait they are not real, they are realtime 3d people/fruit. So that caught my Eye and I loved the fact that this was a good choice to buy and then watch this
awfull film",1036108800,2,801,3.950617283950617
1236347,5,B00000JQ9X,"I saw the trailer for this movie on a rental and couldn't get it out of my mind.  When I went to order it, I was pretty leery of purchasing it after reading the reviews.  However, considering its cost and potential use in my daycare, I decided to give it a try.  The kids LOVE it.  This one is NOT for adults.  Many of the children I care for love this movie so much their grandparents HAD to purchase it for them to keep in their homes!  Do your kids a favor and try it.  You have very little to lose!",984355200,4,502,3.910891089108911

1236349,5,B00000JQ9X,My 5 year old loves this movie!  What a cute way to depict The Nutcracker for young children.,945648000,,93,4.166666666666667
1236350,1,B00000JQ9X,"I can't understand how anyone can like this movie.  I dunno, maybe I've been spoiled by Toy Story and the like, but this movie was simply not good.  The musical numbers reeked and the characters were annoying, especially  the whiney blonde chick who looked like she was half asleep most of the  time and that bimbo of a nutcracker with that idiot grin of his.  There's  no way I'd pay $1 for this movie, let alone $14.",944092800,2,418,4.363636363636363

7913121,1,B00000JQ9X,"Meghan Trainor said it best: Nah to the ah to the no no NO! Now, before y'all judge me, let me just say this: As a child, I LOVED this movie. Like, I LOVED IT!!! Watched it all the time and couldn't stop! I checked it out again as an adult...as in right now and let me tell you; I thought this movie was SO BAD that I actually had to vent about it! First of all, it's too clich&eacute;. Princess falls in love (Marie isn't a princess. they sure portray her as that), meets her Prince nutcracker, they fall in love, Marie's in trouble, Prince rescues her via friggin motocycle, although it's a big, giant cheese, oh, and then they kiss at the end. Somebody PLEASE tell me where I haven't seen that before PLEASE, I'm begging you! I was like, ""This is too clich&eacute;! Like, NO NO NO NO NO!"" Secondly, people say the most obvious and ridiculous things! For example: Marie, WHY WOULD YOU RESCUE THE RAT, WHY???? Like...NO, ARE YOU CRAZY??? I'm surprised the Prince didn't tell you, ""Shoot, you're on your own now, babe."" I was like, ""Nope!"" All in all, HELL NO to the movie, HELL. NO. They better be lucky I wasn't a character in the movie because I would've turned it upside-down in EVERY which way. Smh...",1481760000,,1206,4.364444444444445

7913129,1,B00000JQ9X,I watched with my 3.5 year old. What a waste of time. The animation is poor and the storyline is lame with ridiculous characters. I don't understand the high reviews (the friends and family of the folks making the movie?).,1418169600,,222,4.575
