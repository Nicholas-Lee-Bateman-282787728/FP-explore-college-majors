 The cinematography (er, videography, that is) is about as inspiring as 6 o'clock news footage. It's all handheld camera work. Some of the minute-long takes prove interesting. The occassional zoom-in on an actor's face usually draws more attention to the camera than to the actor. And for some reason, scenes intended to look dark are still brightly lit. There's no air of mystery in these shots.

 Special effects consist of either creative editing, or by the infamous green screen method. On simpler tricks, such as a flying broomstick, invisible fishing line can be used, as opposed to the above methods.

 If it's a visual, cinematic treat you're looking for, i suggest you consult imdb.com, which lists other productions of Bulgakov's book - including a new Russian production, due to be completed in 2005.

 One reviewer wrote that the picture looked ""muddy."" I don't entirely agree. Granted, it was shot on analogue video, and VHS is nothing more than an analogue video copy of analogue video. And this is what it looks like.

 Might i note, i watched this using a stereo VCR, and only the linear sound tracks were playing. Meaning, the sound is in mono, and not terribly clear, as is always the case with linear tracks. But, no worry, aside from a couple zany sound effects, and repetitive music - there isn't much to hear, unless you are fluent in Polish.

 On the plus side, this production comes across as a great theater piece. Like a really talented drama group got together - selected a couple Russian-esque locations, and ran with it, using Bulgakov's book as the screenplay. There's a lot of love in this production. It has a very charming olde world aspect. In fact, the talking cat, is nothing more than an actor dressed up as a cat. However, the oppressive 20th Century Russia atmosphere depicted by Bulgakov doesn't come across. The narrative - his story does - but not the atmosphere.

 Like Masterpiece Theatre, it's very true to the source - you have to overlook some pictoral discrepancies: the actor who plays Woland does NOT have two different colored eyes, and for some reason the earth stood still during this production - it's always daytime.

 If you're looking for a video of Bulgakov's masterwork - that's true to the source, you can't go wrong with this four tape set. The choice is yours. Do you want to read all of Bulgakov's dialogue on the screen, or in a book?",1091145600,3,2627,4.830357142857143
7936880,5,B00005B6XP,"I got it for myself as an early Christmas present and am really glad I did. This production is very faithful to the original novel that was published in '67 (translations based on a later edition added interesting, but not essential, material). Bulgakov's Devil is more a deadpan agent of justice--doing God's dirty work perhaps--than the figure of evil more familiar to western audiences. Great perfromances by all; even those playing minor characters like Natasha and Hella made the most of their roles. The Devil's Ball was very sumptuous.
The only downside is that the tape reflects the age of the original TV production (14 years), and I'd rather this were available on DVD, but if you're at all familiar with the book, this is a must-have.",1041292800,4,745,4.874015748031496
7936881,5,B00005B6XP,"This Polish adaptation of the original Master and Margarita (aka Master and Margaret) is a wonderful video that I would recommend to anyone who appreciates a complex comedy, drama, and most of all, a work of art. Master and Margaret is an adaptation of Mikhail Bulgakov's play written in the 1930's. The only negative thing about this video were the subtitles being hard to read and they do not always remain long enough on the screen. Besides the subtitle problems, it is an excellent video which is on four tapes and was worth the money spent. The story has many twists and turns within including complex stories within stories that appear to be unrelated, later to have everything come together in the end. This work of art is so unique, it cannot be compared to anything you probably have ever seen. Partial comparisons that come to mind are Kiss of the Spider Woman and Pulp Fiction. The story is about the devil coming to Moscow for a friendly visit. The devil is very much like a genie as told in Aladdin's lamp but not as much of a granter of wishes, but an observer. The devil is portrayed as a kind and generous man. It is the greed of the people who come across his path who end up suffering the consequence of their actions. For those who are truly kind, generous and without selfishness, the devil rewards them. The devil has a couple of assistants. One is a gentleman, the other is a human sized cat that plays a rather significant role in the story. I mentioned there were several stories within this play. The first story is an argument between two atheists and the devil whether Jesus ever existed. The devil takes them visually to Rome in the days of Caesar to tell the story about Pontius Pilate. Another story involves a writer known as Master who is writing a story about Pontius Pilate. The writer loses his sanity and attempts to destroy the manuscripts by burning them. However, manuscripts don't burn as seen later. Another story includes the lovely Margarita who cares for the person she calls Master. Her wishes are not as much for herself, but for others including Master. The devil is truly impressed with her generosity and grants her wishes without any strings attached. The significant wish is the returning of Master and his manuscript that was believed to have been destroyed. Unfortunately, there is just too much of this story to be able to put into summarization here. If you watch this video, be patient, for it starts off a little slow, appears to go all over the place, picks up an accelerated pace, and all comes together near the end. When I looked at everything that went on, my mind was working for days thinking about everything that happened and how it all ties together. This story is something I will never forget.",998784000,6,2762,4.627291242362525
