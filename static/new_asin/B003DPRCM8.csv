8394869,5,B003DPRCM8,Eric Ritter has the rare gift of being both an extremely accomplished martial artist and an inspiring teacher.  I have watched him motivate countless students to achieve more than they imagined possible.  Eric has a deep understanding of real world martial arts and wastes no time on that which cannot be put into practice on the street.  He is equally comfortable articulating how it's done using paragraphs or a lightning fast takedown.  Get this video!,1269475200,2,455,5.026666666666666
8394870,5,B003DPRCM8,"I have learned from many highly revered martial artist, in various disciplines, during over twenty years of training.  None compare with the skill and ability of Eric Ritter.  Eric is a true warrior and the best martial artist I have ever seen.

Forget the power or positive thinking! Don't bother summoning your inner Chi.  Skip the gimmicks. Learn simple and practical techniques that have been tested and actually work.  If you're not fortunate enough to train with Eric Ritter in person, buy his video.

Eric has outstanding stand-up and ground fighting skills and provides instruction that is easy to understand.  As a peace officer I appreciate the skill I have gained from training with Eric Ritter.  It's nice to know when it comes time to go hands on, I've got the tools I need to get the job done.

Thanks Eric!!!",1269302400,2,823,4.780141843971631
8394871,5,B003DPRCM8,"I have had the pleasure of training under Mr. Ritter while I was on the west coast. He is an amazing martial artist and a terrific instructor. I learned just as much from the DVD that I did while he was training me in person. I look forward to any more books or videos to be released, but I am not sure if there are any coming soon. I am a customer / student for life of Mr. Ritter. His training seminars have helped me to become a better police officer and have saved my skin once or twice too in some situations. Thanks Mr. Ritter!",1269302400,,533,4.037735849056604
