It was easy to follow, instructions and music were great, and the moves were easy to do.  After 2 plus weeks of doing this every other day 'm feeling great and flexibility is noticeably improved.  I would highly recommend this DVD.",1337299200,16,373,4.507462686567164

4862253,5,B005S0STQE,I love Rodney Yee! I bought this to replace the AM yoga with Rodney and got 2 for 1! This is the best way to wake up in the morning with Mr. Yee's morning yoga!,1410393600,,160,3.6
4862254,5,B005S0STQE,"The AM portion is so simple yet very effective. Loosens up all the aches and pains that you start to wake up with at my age.:) And this is truly better than any pain medication! Case in point: I was having terrible back and leg pain yesterday (so bad that it had kept me up all night) but by the end of the AM practice, I was pain free and stayed that way the rest of the day. The workout starts off slow and with small movements and gradually moves on to larger stretches incorporating more body parts until your whole body has been stretched. Some may find it boring/repetitive but it feels amazing. (Note: I haven't tried the PM portion yet.)",1408060800,,645,4.295081967213115

4862259,4,B005S0STQE,"I've never done yoga before but liked the idea of a ""wakeup"" (AM) and ""relax"" (PM) routine esp for my busy and stressful life.
I found it hard to follow along because the narrator would talk before the moves were done, talked fast, and TBH was a little confusing. Also, quite intimidating for the instructors to be able to bend in half and such >.<

HAVING TRY YOGA AND HOT YOGA BEFORE I DO NOT CONSIDER MYSELF A BIGINNER. HOWEVER; I HAVE NOT DONE YOGA IN A COUPLE OF YEARS AND STARTED TO FEEL TIGHTNESS HERE AND THERE. THIS DVD IS EXACTLY WHAT I  NEEDED TO LOOSEN UP AND BECOME FLEXIBLE AGAIN.  IT HAS TWO WORK OUTS AM (MORNING) AND PM (EVENING) I MOSTLY DO PM AND FIND IT THAT IS EASY TO FOLLOW, JUST THE RIGHT LENGHT ONLY (30 MINUTES) AND VERY RELAXING AT THE END.

Not to mention his wonderful partner Colleen who demonstrates each yoga move to perfection. The settings, music and lovely aspects of both these dedicated Yoga teachers cannot be praised enough. They have truly helped my health, strength and emotional mood with their excellence and dedication to helping all who are wanting to learn the correct approaches to yoga. Many kudos to both of them for making yoga a joy and I highly recommend Rodney Yees yoga dvds to all. Beginners and experienced yogis.",1394236800,3,630,4.897196261682243

4862270,2,B005S0STQE,"I've used Rodney several years ago and wanted to get back into Yoga. I couldn't be more disappointed. This is NOT for beginners.
He tells you to go into several 'named' moves like Downward Dog but never explains what they are: u have to look up from ur pose and mimic him then he's already moved into the next pose. Not happy :(",1392768000,,328,4.222222222222222

4862272,3,B005S0STQE,"I have been practicing yoga for more than 15 years which means that I am 15 years older. Nonetheless the AM practice was too challenging both pose-wise and time-wise. I simply do not want to spend that long warming up.

The PM practice is worth the purchase price. I find the practice extremely relaxing. It does drag toward the very end. It took a while to become accustomed to Colleen Saidman's voice, not the most soothing for an evening practice.",1386979200,,450,4.625
4862273,4,B005S0STQE,"Rodney Yee's section is better. A nice, quick little morning session to loosen your back and hips.  The evening session does not give me the same peace or pleasure.  But a very good for beginners yoga tape.",1383782400,2,206,4.54054054054054
4862274,4,B005S0STQE,"I've got a couple of Rodney Yee's DVD's and I especially enjoy some morning yoga to gently awaken. He's got a nice soothing voice which is great for anyone. I haven't tried the evening yoga, though. This one starts slowly and builds but the some of the breathing guidance gets a little confusing in the middle of the beginning. I still enjoy it, though and feel refreshed and energized whenever I get to do it. I would recommend this.",1383264000,,434,4.506329113924051

4862277,2,B005S0STQE,"My nutritionist insisted that I get this DVD and start yoga.  I tried it once and I could not keep up with the nice old man on the DVD.  I am simply not that bendable, and the next few days I was pretty sore, frustrated and still confused about exactly what was supposed to have happened during this yoga session.  Someone who can keep up with an exercise DVD may have better luck, but this young person cannot!  Not for me!",1376179200,,424,4.197530864197531
4862278,4,B005S0STQE,"Nice way to start the day and easy to get started no matter what level you of ""beginner"" you are.  Watch it through once or twice before trying it to see how he does the poses first.",1376006400,,182,3.918918918918919
4862279,4,B005S0STQE,"My only complaint, is that on Rodney's other dvd's there is a ""minimal instruction"" option so you only get the names of the poses as you switch from one to another.  I really like that, so there isn't a lot of talking, but on this one the other option is ""music only"", with no instruction at all.  What?! All or nothing?! I understand this is a beginner dvd, but as you learn the routine you won't need each breath and transition described in detail. I'll probably still use this for an easy day, but will switch back to the others often since I really like the minimal instruction option.",1375920000,3,589,4.394495412844036
4862280,4,B005S0STQE,"The Am Yoga with Rodney Yee is great!  It's been years since I practiced and the am yoga is gentle and when you're done your body will feel amazing!  I don't however like the PM yoga.  There was one of these that he did a long time ago, with Suzanne Deeson that was better that I'm yet to find, but Rodney Yee is my favorite.",1375747200,,325,3.9692307692307693
4862281,4,B005S0STQE,"I'll admit I don't do the AM session much - too much trouble getting out of bed early enough, but I love the PM session.  It is so relaxing that it helped me go to sleep without the use of melatonin or other sleep aids.  It is also perfect for beginners (like I was).  After using this video for several months, I bought another Colleen Saidman yoga DVD to step up my workouts.  I still use this one when I am too tired to do the others.",1372982400,7,437,3.9885057471264367
4862282,5,B005S0STQE,"I own about 7 of Rodney's Yoga DVD's and this is the one I keep coming back too. I love Rodney's A.M workout and feel amazing afterwards. It's not to long and I love the back stretches/twists. I'm new to Yoga and did not feel it was too difficult, albeit I did need to try it a few times to feel the rhythm and gain confidence. P.M was also good (and a little more difficult for me) but I prefer the A.M routine.",1372636800,2,412,3.9759036144578315
4862283,3,B005S0STQE,I have tried to get into yoga with no avail.  My trainer suggested this an really likes this couple.  I have only tried it twice.  It was still to difficult for me to get into it.  Hopefully I will try again.,1371686400,,208,4.0
4862284,5,B005S0STQE,I was pleased with my order. it arrived quickly and in good condition.  I was able to submit it to our club as a new exercise,1369958400,,125,3.8076923076923075
4862285,3,B005S0STQE,"I bought this at the suggestion of a friend who thought it might help me with relaxation. Although I want to be in this 100%, it was hard to find it relaxing at first. The movements seemed perfect in some spots, too rushed in others. I chalked this up to my own inexperience.

I've struggled with the movements feeling more natural to me, but I think that I'm most frustrated with what feels like imbalance between the ""work"" and the ""relax"" parts of it. Basically it feels like work to get into some of the positions, but not so much work (like other kinds of exercise routines) that my body feels fatigued to the point where the relaxation part feels great.

I'll keep trying, though! And I admit it does seem less like a chore now than it did when I first started.",1369872000,,767,4.356643356643357
4862286,5,B005S0STQE,I really enjoy Rodney and Colleens DVD so much! I decided to not go to expensive over crowded classes anymore and since I know yoga (and they explain so well) I felt safe that this was right for me. I have reviewed many other teachers and they are the best for me!!,1369785600,,265,4.115384615384615

4862288,4,B005S0STQE,"This is the best yoga work out for a beginner I have seen.  I would consider myself a bit beyond beginner and I still enjoy this.  The best part of all is that the 4 cycle breath meditation is incorporated into the yoga workout.  Highly recommend, especially for the first time yoga experience.",1369440000,,294,4.509433962264151

4862290,3,B005S0STQE,"In my opinion, this was still a little difficult for beginners.  I used to do yoga classes 4 times a week.  I am currently trying to get back into yoga.  I was able to do some of this, but had to adapt some of it.  I think it would be helpful -- especially to those who are NEW to yoga -- to make some recommendations on adapting poses, etc.",1367193600,,341,3.898550724637681
4862291,1,B005S0STQE,"I have been using another beginner's video by this instructor, so I requested this one as a gift.  I am really disappointed.  There is no instruction at all.  The assumption is that I know the poses, but as a beginner, how can I?  The yoga routine moves too quickly; I look up to see what he is talking about and he has already moved on to another pose.  Purchasers need to know that this video has no pose guide.  There is also no directory to where the poses are used, so, if you want to click through the routine to watch and learn the poses you don't know, you have to watch every scene and write a directory yourself.

I doubt I will attempt to use this again, at least until I am not a beginner any more.

Very sad about this because based on Rodney Yee's Yoga for Beginners, I expected a much better product.",1364342400,11,815,4.17948717948718
4862292,1,B005S0STQE,"I purchased this DVD after using Rodneys Yee's earlier video and expected something as good or better. This one is a definite waste of money. I would have expected more from this, and hope I can exchange it for a different item. There are much better videos out there.",1362700800,2,268,4.489795918367347
4862293,4,B005S0STQE,"While this is a great start for those wanting to begin yoga, he uses terms that are not fully explained, It would be much more helpful if a pdf was included that explained exactly what the yoga positions are. You blink and you could miss something useful.",1362528000,,255,4.446808510638298
4862294,2,B005S0STQE,"I have to say that I felt completely mislead by this product description and photo.  I had owned the Rodney Yee/Patricia Walden AM/PM yoga workout on VHS years ago, and I really liked it.  I expected this to be the same workouts, but on DVD.  Instead, it is a remake, with an older Rodney Yee guiding you through a morning routine that is quite different from -- and not nearly as challenging as -- the one I had loved on VHS.  I was willing to accept that, since I'm older, too, and less flexible than I once was.  (One thing that continues to bother me about this routine, though: Yee's overdubbed breathing instructions are difficult to synchronize with my own.  I must breathe more deeply than he does.  Furthermore, after doing it for several days, it has become clear to me that there is at least one place where he mistakes an inhalation instruction for an exhalation instruction, and it's confusing.)

After a few days I decided to try the ""Patricia Walden"" PM routine.  What a disappointment to discover that, despite Patricia Walden's face on the cover, and Patricia Walden's name in the description, it is not her workout at all, but one by Colleen Saidman.  The routine is okay, but again, not as challenging as the one I had remembered.  Instead of feeling relaxed during the workout, I felt myself getting increasingly angry at the bait-and-switch, and am now considering returning it.

I decided to go back on Amazon today to try to see if I could find the original AM/PM Yoga I had loved on VHS.  I hope I have found it in this product http://www.amazon.com/A-M-P-M-Yoga-Rodney-Yee/dp/B00007JME6/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1362591296&sr=8-1&keywords=am+pm+yoga.

4862298,5,B005S0STQE,Great beginners video for anyone who has or hasn't done yoga before.  AM Yoga is a great way to get you blood moving to start your day.  The PM version is a great relax segment before retiring for the night.,1357776000,,207,4.15
4862299,3,B005S0STQE,"My husband and I used to practice AM YOGA FOR BEGINNERS on VHS and loved it so much we completely wore out the tape. I was sad the day the tape just stopped working. I was thrilled to find AM YOGA etc on DVD  and ordered it. We were hoping for the same workout but realized that was wishful thinking. We were a bit disappointed in the workout as well as the cameraman's angles. For example, I was interested in what Rodney's legs were doing and the focus was on his hands being raised over his head. The camera needed to pull back more so the viewer could see the entire pose. Too much repetition at the beginning that was boring. We will continue to use, I just think more time should have gone into the entire routine,more stretching variety, for example.",1353628800,2,757,4.330985915492958
4862300,1,B005S0STQE,"let me be honest right off the bat and tell you I have not done the workout yet. that said, i like to just view the workout once or twice before i actually attempt it to see what to expect. i have ""Rodney Yee's Am/Pm Yoga for Beginners"" and it is a great dvd. It had a tutorial that showed you the basic moves and it gave me a great overview of what I would be doing for the workouts. unfortunately, this dvd does not have a tutrorial. nor does it even seem to have any sort of disc menu so that you can skip over the endless ads and rodney's speech. this feature in a dvd is IMPERATIVE for anyone that wants to do the workout first thing in the morning (when not fully awake and capable of working a dvd player properly) or if you are pressed for time and want to get right to it. making the buyer watch the same commercials every single time you put the workout in is beyond obnoxious.
once I finally got to the workout to view, i was very surprised at how fast-paced it looked. maybe his idea of beginner is different than my actual have-only-done-one-yoga-workout-ever-in-my-life-and-have-only-been-doing-that-fot-4-months reality. I know i will eventually attempt this dvd. for now, i feel that i really need to master the one i already have before i even think about moving on.
in summation, the set up of the dvd itself makes this dvd unappealing to use.",1349222400,4,1361,4.426294820717131

8484520,2,B005S0STQE,"Bought this looking for the AM Yoga from 1999. Not it. Rodney Yee's new ""AM Yoga"" is hardly for beginners unlike his original version in 1999. Unless you are very agile, most of the poses are impossible. Unlike the original video on VHS, there is really no compromise. Do it or skip it. Soon you are skipping the entire exercise, watching Rodney flow through positions you could only hope to do.

I found the original PM Yoga segment impossible with its frequent lunges. While I did not watch the PM segment of this DVD, I suspect it was even more beyond a beginner's ability.

My comments are from the perspective of a senior. Your experience may differ.",1508716800,3,655,4.589743589743589
