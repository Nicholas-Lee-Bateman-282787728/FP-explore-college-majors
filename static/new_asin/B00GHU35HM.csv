6077058,4,B00GHU35HM,"Although this movie is probably the most accurate representation of the life of St. Augustine and I like it, it is NOT for any children. I am kind of shocked it was shown in parishes without a warning that the material was not appropriate for children. As mentioned the violence is present but no review yet has mentioned the sex scenes. Yes they are tame by modern media standards but there are several scenes showing women wearing very little in very immoral situations with men. I know the life of St. Augustine and his friends and these scenes are surely accurate but I want anyone that is considering purchasing this film be forewarned that this is probably not what you want your kids to see until you as a parent feel they are ready for it. Have them read his confessions first and talk about it. We will be preparing our teens in this way. I am still very surprised a good publisher like Ignatius would not warn parents that this film contains sex and violence so parents can make informed decisions about what their families view.",1387238400,128,1039,4.561497326203209
6077059,5,B00GHU35HM,Excellent movie-would recommend to anyone who wants to get a small insight to this pillar of our faith.  The movie was family friendly.,1386633600,14,135,4.869565217391305
6077060,5,B00GHU35HM,Wonderful movie. I really enjoyed this movie. It is truly inspirational and I would recommend it to anyone interested in learning more about the life of this great saint; Doctor of the Church.,1385596800,19,192,4.848484848484849
6077061,2,B00GHU35HM,"It could have been a good movie, but I  was disgusted by all the graphic violence.  When I called someone at Ignatius press, they said it was unrated, but probably would be rated PG 13.  I don't think it should be thought of  as a ""family"" movie.  So much violence seems unnecessary, and only detracts from the main story of a great saint's life.  My guess is that the director was catering to the American audience's appetite for violence.
To be fair I must say that I viewed the movie on U tube (with Polish subtitles) before it was released by Ignatius Press.  Maybe Ignatius Press edited out the most graphic parts, as the other reviewers did not mention it.",1385510400,9,662,4.466666666666667
6077062,5,B00GHU35HM,"I enjoyed watching both version, the theatrical and original version. Both included when you buy Restless Heart. The confessions of St. Augustine gives us all something to think about. We are all sinners and we are all forgiven for our sins, if we are truly sorry. We are all no different than St. Augustine. As children of God, we must try our very best to follow His laws. Buy this movie and see what I mean.",1385251200,36,410,4.407894736842105

6077064,5,B00GHU35HM,"After the many screenings throughout North America, this much anticipated movie is finally, for us to own. Some of us lucky ones have had the pleasure of owning a copy from the time of the screening. However I had to wait. And the wait was well worth it. This is a wonderful epic from veteran Canadian director, Christian Duguay, who has given us films like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Joan-of-Arc/dp/B00000JS6F/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Joan of Arc</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pius-XII-Under-the-Roman-Sky/dp/B00BYCOIWE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pius XII: Under the Roman Sky</a>. I would like to divide this review into several parts so as to facilitate any prospective customers as to what to expect.

1. The Discs : There are 2 discs.

The first disc is the theatrical release which is 133 minutes long. This is the same film that was shown throughout the many theaters in North America. The contents of this disc are, the film itself, Scene selections, a 27 minute documentary on St. Augustine by Fr. Benedict Groeschel, a theatrical trailer. This disc has both English and Spanish subtitles.

The Second disc: this is the extended version  which is 203 minutes long. Features include scene selections and theatrical trailer. There are NO subtitles on this disc.

On both discs, the movies are in English.

2. As with most Ignatius Press DVDs, there is a  full 24 page booklet on the Saint by Fr. David Meconi S.J. Professor of Patristic Theology, St. Louis University. The contents of this booklet are as follows:

a) About the film.
b) St. Augustine's intellectual Odyssey
c) Major works and contributions
d) Discussion Questions
e) Learn More (indicates more material to be used to learn about the Saint)
f) Scene Selections

With that out of the way, the movie is a very compelling retelling on the life of St. Augustine from his very birth to his episcopacy in Hippo. It is full of drama, wit, tears (particularly those of his mother Saint Monica),heartbreak (with regard to his concubine, Khalida) and  cunning. The young Augustine is a man, as pictured and from his  `Confessions' driven by ambition to gain the world: to be renowned, feared, to have status and power; to enjoy all the pleasures of the flesh, and finally being a slave to sin and the devil. The actor does a fantastic job of portraying Augustine as arrogant, narcissistic and proud, who would not even sway to the constant appeals of his loving mother(also beautifully, nay,magnificently acted out by a superlative actress!). Event after event, all of his own volition, would lead him away from her, but in this mother we see a true woman of faith (and of tough stuff!) who would not let go and would storm both heaven (and Augustine!) until she gains for him the grace of Baptism. Another important figure in this film is the character of St. Ambrose, whose character makes an indelible mark on the film and historically in the life of St. Augustine.

One can also see again the clash between the government (pictured by the Roman Dowager Empress) and the ecclesiastical authorities (St. Ambrose). Events that would be pivotal in the conversion of St. Augustine and that would cause him to renounce his position as the Court Orator.

From there we are taken to Hippo, from whence our film begins, with the city being besieged by the Vandals and the Bishop Augustine futilely seeking a middle ground to prevent bloodshed. Unafraid in all circumstances, purely motivated by the love of God, this film demonstrates to every person that even if we were the greatest sinner, there is always hope when we repent and trust in the mercies of God. This film borrows heavily from the Confessions of St. Augustine.

As mentioned, the main characters of this film are wonderfully acted out.

One can really relate to this film, for in the person of the young Augustine, we can see the faces of many of our youth who make ambition foremost in their lives, and who seek the world to the detriment and loss of their souls. Also the clash between the civil and religious authorities is still on going. Therefore the life of St. Augustine is as relevant today as it was 1500 years ago. Mothers, who have difficult relations with their children can gain much comfort and inspiration from this story, particularly in the person of St. Monica.

The extended version has a few added scenes than the theatrical version and personally, I liked it better. However it takes nothing  away from the theatrical version. It has a better flow, with an extended storyline(which includes a love interest that some will not particularly care for) and with the addition of a couple of extra characters. If one has time to spare then one should see the extended version. Taking into consideration its length, I would suggest breaking the film into 2 or 3 parts, lest the viewer gets tired. The most important thing is to learn the message this film has to convey and to digest it, rather than just watching a movie!

Please be forewarned. This film does have scenes of sensuality. Therefore parents, kindly take note.

This is a great film resounding with hope for everyone. Definitely a must see.

6077073,5,B00GHU35HM,I know of St Augustine and his early years but the change in him was remarkable. The actors were excellent. I think all adults should try to see this. I wish it were in the theaters. Very sobering.,1479686400,,197,4.2105263157894735
6077074,5,B00GHU35HM,Good movie,1478390400,,10,4.5
6077075,4,B00GHU35HM,"Done in flashbacks. Good casting of sympathetic actors to play the young, mid-aged and elderly Augustine. Not much here for people who want to see the 'Protestant' Augustine, this was unquestionably a Roman Catholic production and so no attention is really given to his systematic theology. His ideas on justification, predestination, etc., get no attention whatsoever. His intellectual & spiritual struggles with Neoplatonism & Manichaeanism are however covered nicely. That's my Lutheran commentary on the film.

The movie is framed by his Confessions and set against the backdrop of the coming siege upon Hippo by the Vandals in 430. Augustine is penning his Confessions and people are pressing him to leave and he keeps saying, ""Not yet . . . "" He has one more thing to write and that is the 'hatch' that opens into a flashback to his life.

I watched the full version and my attention was held the entire time. I haven't watched the 73 minute version as of yet.

If you have enjoyed the sword and sandal Bible epics of the past, the HBO series ROME or the tv shows Hercules & Xena, you will likely enjoy this movie, it has a mix of those production values - minus the sex, violence & mythical monsters. The production values are very good. Some scenes do look CGI enhanced but you do not feel like you are in a video game, more like something akin to a balance between the 2006 film 300 and actual reality, and only in certain parts of the film, not the entire film.",1476230400,,1471,4.628352490421456

6077077,5,B00GHU35HM,"This is not your film for entertainment, or to kill some time. This is for a devoted student of ""THE TRUTH"". A seeker. A devotee of God. The truth of Love. One eternal truth that can't be expressed in words. Only felt directly. No amount of information is going to accurately describe taste on an orange. Only actually having a taste of orange, biting into it, will you get a true DIRECT experience of the taste... metaphor for TRUTH. Even these words are redundant and are prone to 10,000 arrangements. So this film attempts to give you a TASTE of truth. It's 3 hours long. And recommended for anyone on path to truth, no matter what path you're taking to realize the truth.",1474070400,4,675,4.495934959349594
6077078,4,B00GHU35HM,"The movie, Restless Heart, was very good, but I had waited so long to order it, I was expecting more from it. Sometimes I find I do have to watch certain film more than once to catch all there is.",1471305600,,196,3.925
6077079,5,B00GHU35HM,a beautiful movie!!!!! highly recommended!!!! our hearts are restless until they find the rest in God!!!!,1469145600,,105,5.625
6077080,2,B00GHU35HM,"Didn't really like it. Not very moving. I did not feel it really captured the spirit of St. Augustine and his struggles and accomplishments. Not especially accurate, and a lot of scenes that I don't think were more risque than they needed to be for the purpose of the movie.",1465689600,,274,4.5
6077081,4,B00GHU35HM,"Having read St. Augustine's Confessions, the City of God, and On the Trinity, I thought the movie had some questionable scene for accuracy. I think the movie captures the spiritual struggle of St. Augustine, particularly the way the movie dealt with objective truth. Before his conversion, Augustine's attitude was like the politicians, media reporters, so-called university educators. Augustine was unhappy when he considered truth as something of convenience for success in life, but the movie showed the evils resulting from such a view. This turned Augustine's mind toward a thirst for real objective truth, which he found in God. He particularly developed a love for the Bible. But, I do not know if parts of the film were factual. In the Confessions, I did not read that Augustine was the chief orator for the royal court. Nor that Augustine participated in an attack on Ambrose's church. What I was troubled about most was the ending. I have never read anywhere the facts as they were presented. Did Augustine actually negotiate for the release of soldiers with the Vandals? I believe that Augustine dies a year before in Hippo, before the attack of the Vandals. The story at the end had a political message: peace negotiation trumps military strength. I have no idea that the Roman centurion, a pagan, married St. Augustine's niece. It shows Augustine presiding over a marriage, but no prescribed Baptism of the pagan soldier. Was the centurion's father the murdered judge in the debate between the Catholics and the Donatists? I had the feeling that the ending was contrived, but not completely historical or factual.",1465257600,8,1626,5.07089552238806
6077082,5,B00GHU35HM,Thank you,1464393600,,9,4.0
6077083,3,B00GHU35HM,"Well-done but overly dramatized version of St. Augustine's Confessions.  If you've read that book, you will enjoy little reminders of the story throughout the movie but then wonder why some of the more important parts were left out or passed over too quickly.  In other instances you will be baffled at the fictionalized drama and the romantic side story involving Augustine's beautiful niece.

In either case, you will learn something about the life of St. Augustine and the religious controversies swirling about at the time of the fall of the Roman Empire in the West.",1464048000,,571,4.989473684210527
6077084,5,B00GHU35HM,"Great movie with good acting. For those of you complaining about not being able to follow this movie you have to watch the original 203 min version because there is way too much cut out of the the theatrical version so you won't have a clue what's going on in certain scenes. Also there is nothing offensive in this movie the ""sex"" scenes are tame and there is very little graphic violence. Lastly, for those of you that are offended by the fact they use the word Catholic in the movie? First of all this is an Italian movie and Italians are Catholic and second of all St. Augustine actually was CATHOLIC. so as a Catholic myself I say  to those you who are sooooo offended by this fact to GET A LIFE.",1462752000,5,701,4.2706766917293235

6077099,1,B00GHU35HM,"I started to buy this film and then saw this review from a Catholic Bishop and decided against it.  There is also an article on Christianity Today that gives a very mixed review of this film,
Instead of watching the Super Bowl 2014, we watched the fairly new St. Augustin video from Ignatius Press. Its interesting how much emphasis the producers put on Augustins sex life in this video, and how explicit the sex was that was shown on screen.  We had to fast forward thru lots of the video.  Regarding the conversion of Augustin, it was shown briefly, but how disappointing it was that his lovely Mother, Saint Monica, was not shown to be the greatest influence upon his conversion.  Nothing was shown of her holy tears and petitions thru Saint Ambrose, Bishop of Milan.  The great story of Augustin is of Monica, his Mother, her prayers and tears.  The end of the movie was strange, leading the viewers to believe he was murdered by the Vandals who attacked the city of Hippo.  I don't recommend this video, a waste of time and distortion of the true conversion of Augustin.

When I purchased this movie, I mentally tried to prepare myself that it was going to be another B rate Christian movie and to just focus on the content.  The acting is excellent and very compelling; so is the story.  The film quality is not Hollywood standards, but I was pleasantly surprised that it was much better than expected.  St. Augustine's life is inspiring to all because he is someone we can relate to.  His life shows that there is hope for all and that conversion is always possible.

6077131,1,B00GHU35HM,"Just as one unrepented mortal sin is enough for the all-loving, merciful God to throw a soul into hell for all eternity, so no movie can be considered worthy, when it is an occasion for mortal sin.  Remember, even a lustful thought, consented to, is a mortal sin for Catholics who know better.  We must take on the mind of Christ, and stop making excuses for such heinous displays of lust, so offensive to Christ.  In Christ, not the slightest stain is tolerated, but what can be said of the filth of lust we all have grown so calloused to on movies?

But the worst of the worst, is a SAINT movie, that displays any sort of sexual content whatsoever.  Because they entrap the innocent.  Who will be watching these movies, but those who are attempting to live a pure lifestyle?  The innocent, pure, or at least those who aspire to be.
Even little children.  And Jesus says, it were better that a MILLSTONE BE TIED AROUND HIS NECK, AND HE BE THROWN INTO THE DEEPEST SEA than that he scandalize one of God's little ones.

It goes without saying that ALL depictions of sex, and even illusions toward it, should greatly offend all Catholics. No one, adults included, should be subjected to this great evil, which so greatly offends God, Most Holy. St. Paul says : ""let it not be so much as MENTIONED among you"". I am sure St. Augustine is horrified at such a depiction, and offended that his name is used to sell a movie that is a great occasion of sin. Notice how he writes in his confessions. No one could be tempted in his most pure writings. It doesn't matter if it is ""what actually happened"".  His lust was St. Augustine's greatest remorse, and we are now to put it on lurid display?  How will he feel, when he sees the lustful thoughts that occur when souls watch this, knowing they were deceived into watching it by his name? When he took such pains to prevent others from following in his path of lust?  If Christ shed every last drop of His blood for St. Augustine, in order to completely wipe away every last trace of lust in him, who are we to now make public what Christ died to PERMANENTLY ERASE??!!! This is a terrible deceit of the devil, and the modern world is being led by his strings.

Remember, while the modern world wants to make light of lust, under the guise of ""being merciful"", ""not judging""  ""it's natural"", ""it's not really lust..."" etc., it cost Jesus EVERY LAST DROP OF HIS BLOOD.  Those who excuse lust, or say it isn't so serious, will have to answer for the Blood of Our Lord.

Saint movies with sexual content, is like the devil posing as ""an angel of light"".  Since the devil cannot get the good to sin, he must trick them into it.  By making an appearance of good (""this is a saint movie, it was made to inspire others to holiness""), but placing lustful scenes in the movie, the devil is able to get a foothold.  Now he starts working away at the soul, in the recesses of memory, and these scenes can pop up any time in their heads for refreshed temptations.  No, let us not be deceived.  Can any one seriously imagine Christ making a movie like this?  Dressing up the actors and actresses, and giving them instructions on how to display sex scenes?  It's time we stop pretending.  Such movies are an abomination to Jesus, Purity Itself.

To use the name of a saint to sell a movie demands that the movie be made JUST AS THE SAINT would have wanted, to the best of our ability.  Otherwise, leave the saint out of it, it is an outrage, even a sacrilege.",1426636800,7,3484,4.379471228615863

GO's right along with the book - THE CONFESSIONS (translated by Maria Boulding) yet so much more is revealed of his life. You will feel his desire to want to love GOD more and to BE what GOD wants him to be. VERY Breathtaking!!!  The music is beautiful and heavenly. Augustine so deeply expresses himself when he thinks about the wrong (his past) he has done, (after his conversion to Christianity) and it is so powerful! After your acceptance and conversion has been done and you have been delivered by JESUS CHRIST! You really think about all the wrong you have done, which aids in keeping you on the STRAIGHT AND NARROW road because you don't ever want to go back! This movie as well as the book will make you think about your life, and those in JESUS CHRIST will desire (you will feel the pulling of come closer) to love more and to want be like JESUS CHRIST!  Told you I love this Movie.  A few things (very few) was changed in the movie, which was opposite in the book. STILL a powerful movie.  CALL ON JESUS CHRIST, for we NEED HIM for OUR SALVATION! and our DAILY LIFE! (Just talk to HIM, just like I am talking to you.

If you have read Confessions and a good biography of Augustine this movie provides a good companion piece, bringing fine visualization of the man himself living some of the experiences that profoundly changed his life.

6077200,5,B00GHU35HM,"The ""Confessions"" of St. Augustine of Hippo, beloved by Catholics and Protestants alike, is probably the most well-read Christian autobiography of all time. Augustine, whose 76 years (AD 354-430) saw the final decline of the Roman Empire, went from a hedonistic youth (where he made a brilliant public speaking career and drifted through several eccentric philosophies of life) to become one of the greatest Christian thinkers of all time. He even fathered a child out of wedlock with one of several women he seduced, praying to God for ""chastity and continence -- but not yet."" His father was a pagan, but his Christian mother St. Monica and St. Ambrose the bishop of Milan made fruitless efforts to convert him to Christianity.

At age 32, Augustine finally picked up the Bible and read a passage (Rom 14:13-14) from St. Paul's letter to the Romans that exhorted readers to ""put on Christ"" rather than drunkenness, leading him to confront the unhappiness that had resulted from his life choices. He quickly obtained baptism from St. Ambrose, rising to become a priest and later bishop in Hippo, where he died in AD 430 as the Vandal barbarians besieged his city's gates. The Roman Empire fell shortly afterwards.

Recognized by Roman Catholicism as a bishop and doctor of the Church, St. Augustine is one of the most influential writers from the first 500 years of Christianity, with his ""City of God"" defending Christianity's influence on the Roman Empire and his brutally honest ""Confessions"" describing how God fulfilled his deepest desires after years of restlessly searching for fulfillment. When I read the ""Confessions"" in college, I was blown away by its heartfelt narrative and deeply theological passages, but I never thought it would be visualized in a movie. This production proves me wrong.

The film ""Restless Heart"" is directed by French Canadian director Christian Duguay (""Joan of Arc,"" 1999) and originated as an Italian TV miniseries. This Ignatius Press two-disc DVD set includes one disc with a feature-length cut released in U.S. churches and the original three-hour cut on a second disc. The first disc with the theatrical cut is vastly superior, featuring enhanced picture and sound in addition to special features that include a little EWTN television documentary on Augustine hosted by Franciscan friar Andrew Apostoli CFR. The second disc features just the original film cut in washed-out colors, appearing untouched from its television premiere. Having seen both versions, I believe you get the gist of the story on Disc 1, while the three-hour cut from Disc 2 mostly includes fictionalized elements that add nothing to the story.

The story is told in flashback by an elderly Augustine awaiting the barbarian attack on Hippo in AD 430, building to a moving climax. Flawlessly dubbed, it looks like it was originally filmed in English, and I still can't believe how well the voice work matches up with the actors. Believe me: I utterly DESPISE dubbing on foreign films, particularly as found in most of the Italian RAI-TV productions released on DVD by Ignatius Press in the United States. But this film is actually awesome in English, defying conventional wisdom about dubbing.

I showed ""Restless Heart"" (theatrical cut) to 16-year old students in a scripture class and they were astounded at the high quality of the film, very different from many other titles in the Ignatius Press catalogue. Many of the scenes, particularly the conversion sequence of Augustine and final scene with his mother, follow the ""Confessions"" so well that they will move you to tears. Other more historical sequences, including the final assault on Hippo in Augustine's last hours, are brilliant in evoking Christianity's final triumph over the Roman Empire and role in preserving the best of its heritage throughout the coming dark ages. The production values and special effects are extremely good here. If you love St. Augustine, you'll love this movie. Also, if you enjoyed the ""Saint Barbara"" DVD from Ignatius Press, you'll also love this film since its visual style and music (same composer, Andrea Guerra) is the same. I highly recommend it.",1399161600,7,4160,5.1117647058823525

6077204,5,B00GHU35HM,"Purchased April 2014.  I recommend this movie to anyone since the story is entertaining, its widescreen, is in color, has excellent picture and audio quality, and is in English with optional Spanish subtitles.  I was very impressed with the acting, the many different filming locations, the professional costumes, and the huge number of extras.

Its highly recommended to anyone interested in politics, public speaking, and philosophy, debating or pursuing a career as a lawyer, solicitor, priest or politician.

Augustine of Hippo was a pagan, sinner and lived a life of debauchery  pride, a self-admitted slave of lust, and most interested in the praise and recognition from other people.

There is also included 20 minute long -  Who is St. Augustine by Fr. Benedict Groeschel which is very informative and worth watching.  You may want to watch this BEFORE the movie.  Serves as a good overview that will actually help, not spoil your movie watching.

Some screenplay and directorial liberties were taken;  not every scene is a 100% factual retelling of the contents of a book written by Augustine of Hippo entitled Confessions.

There are two DVDs.  The second is the extended edition of the movie  3 hours and 20 minutes.  The first DVD is the 2 hour movie with 5.1 audio.

The movie starts and ends with the preparation for and the siege of the city of Hippo.  I found this to be the most boring parts of the movie.

I could not fast forward or reverse the extended version of the movie; prohibited by disc.  Huh!  I could CHAPTER skip ahead or behind.

Want to know more  research and read:
1) Do a wikipedia search on  St Augustine  you will find info from various sources on the life of this person, his Confessions and more

2) Confessions  [ Library of Congress Catalog Card Number: 55-5021.  This book is in the public domain. ]  Also found on Amazon.

3) On Amazon  Kindle edition $0.99:  The Complete Works of Saint Augustine: The Confessions, On Grace and Free Will, The City of God, On Christian Doctrine, Expositions on the Book Of Psalms, ... (50 Books 

4) Augustine of Hippo: A Biography by Peter Brown (History professor Princeton U)

I was disappointed certain facts were not accurately portrayed.
1) As one would expect from a man who had studied much, his conversion took years.

2) Spoiler: His concubine is shown leaving him.  He left her in the year 385 because he was to be engaged to a rich woman.

3) He had to wait two years until his fiance came of age, and he soon took another concubine. Augustine eventually broke off his engagement and never renewed his relationship with either of his concubines.

4) The following event  is not shown accurately in the movie.  Here is text from Book 8, Chapter 7 of Confessions.

#29. I was saying these things and weeping in the most bitter contrition of my heart, when suddenly I heard the voice of a boy or a girl I know not which--coming from the neighboring house, chanting over and over again, ""Pick it up, read it; pick it up, read it."" [""tolle lege, tolle lege""] Immediately I ceased weeping and began most earnestly to think whether it was usual for children in some kind of game to sing such a song, but I could not remember ever having heard the like. So, damming the torrent of my tears, I got to my feet, for I could not but think that this was a divine command to open the Bible and read the first passage I should light upon. For I had heard how Anthony, accidentally coming into church while the gospel was being read, received the admonition as if what was read had been addressed to him: ""Go and sell what you have and give it to the poor, and you shall have treasure in heaven; and come and follow me."" By such an oracle he was forthwith converted to thee.

So I quickly returned to the bench where Alypius was sitting, for there I had put down the apostle's book when I had left there. I snatched it up, opened it, and in silence read the paragraph on which my eyes first fell: ""Not in rioting and drunkenness, not in chambering and wantonness, not in strife and envying, but put on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make no provision for the flesh to fulfill the lusts thereof."" I wanted to read no further, nor did I need to. For instantly, as the sentence ended, there was infused in my heart something like the light of full certainty and all the gloom of doubt vanished away.",1397779200,14,4365,4.557840616966581
6077205,5,B00GHU35HM,"This movie is by far such a great story of St. Auggie! For those parents who are thinking, does this contain sex?!? Think PG-13 rating. Passionate kissing but probably no longer than 5 seconds at a time and not really focused on that.......so I get what another viewer said, but I thought with proper censorship for a younger audience, it would still be good. For every movie, I would encourage parents to screen first, but love, relationships, etc are part of our lives. So if you have an older teen, I think it would be appropriate. I think St. Auggie deals with what teenagers go through. Finding something to fill a void, only to find out only God can do that. I thought it was brilliantly told, and being a huge fan of St. Auggies Confessions, etc, I thoroughly enjoyed this film. 5 star rating in my book. And the best part?!

When I watched it in a church auditorium, I had a difficult time understanding what is being said, but I consoled myself by promising to buy it when it (finally) came out and then I'd have closed captioning and I could watch it and get so much more out of it.  But when I got it, as I said, there is no closed captioning. Yes, I'm hearing impaired, but there are so many people who need captioning and so many reasons other than hearing impairments that people use closed captions, that it boggles the mind that this very worry film is not captioned.

While the greatest Empire in history is on the brink of a precipice, one man fearlessly searches for the meaning of his life and that of the men and women of his time  - Lux Vide website

430 AD: The Roman North African City of Hippo is under siege from an invading Vandal army led by their King Gaiseric.  Surrounded and hopelessly outnumbered, Hippos Bishop, Aurelius Augustine, tries to persuade Governor Valerius to seek a negotiated settlement.

So opens Christian Duguays epic drama on the life of Roman theologian and philosopher Saint Augustine.  Restless Heart is more than a straight forward biography of Augustine but is an engaging recreation of a civilization in decline.  Now at this point you may be saying, well, this all sounds good but this is a religious movie right? About a saint? It probably has low production values,  preachy and worse of all, boring. Watching this movie sounds like eating my vegetables: its good for me but Im not very excited about it.

Do you think we can live without the truth

Well I have good news for you. Restless Heart is entertaining,  has talented actors, a stirring sound track and high production values. Nor is Restless Hearts Augustine a holy card saint.  He makes mistakes, some of which have tragic consequences for himself and for those around him.

Stunned by military defeat, barbarian invasion, political instability and religious strife, the Roman Empire of the late 4th century and early 5th century was a society facing an identity crises.  Who are we as a people? What made our civilization great? Was it war or was it virtue?  What is to become of us and our culture? Is there hope? And critical to Restless Heart: Why are we failing now and who is to blame?  The drama of the fall of Rome is the stage upon which we watch the unfolding of the life of Augustine from his birth in the 350s AD to his death in Hippo in 430 AD.  Duguay cleverly surrounds Augustine with richly drawn characters and settings that bring this world and its citizens to life.

Our fascination with biographical films lies not with learning what happens to the protagonist but observing how he navigates through his world.  If its done right a good biographical film will draw us into the heros world where we experience vicariously his struggles and triumphs.  Reflecting on the heros life helps us to bring into sharper focus our own lives by enabling us to seeing it from a new perspective.

Teenagers will identity with young Augustines frustration as his intellectual potential is thwarted by his fathers low expectations.  Young adults will see themselves as Augustine works his way through the early days of his career using his uncanny mind and skills as a master orator and lawyer.  We see Augustine fall in love and redefine his relationship with his older parents.  We also see our future as an elderly  Bishop Augustine painfully lets go of his lifes work and his beloved niece in one final triumphful stand against the coming darkness.  In short, this is life and its fascinating as it plays out before our eyes.

Throughout our lives we are touched by mentors and we would not be who we are today without their wise counsel and timely intervention.  For Augustine,  his mentors also play key roles.  The films drama comes from how those relationships evolve over time from advocate to adversary or from adversary to friendship:

- Monica, Augustines mother whose love and prayers supported Augustine throughout his restless search for meaning and truth

- Romanianus, the wealthy olive grower who financially sponsors Augustines education

- Macrobius, a successful lawyer and orator who became Augustines teacher and law partner

- Valerius, Augustines lifetime friend whose ambitions are tied to Augustines success

- Khalida, Augustines mistress and mother of his son who at times demonstrates more wisdom and compassion than Augustine

- Catholic Bishop Ambrose whose intellect and rhetorical skills were more than a match for Augustine",1394928000,5,4035,4.899705014749262

I hope to see more spiritual films by the same people. I love spiritual dvd's, and they rarely reach the standard of this one.
I have only one hope for future films: please include more of the Saint's spiritual life in them. This film concentrated mostly on Augustine's life before his conversion. It would have been enhanced if there were a few more scenes of his inner life.",1394755200,3,597,4.486238532110092

The use of flashback to related the story from the perspective of the end of St. Augustine's life makes you feel you are moving toward some culmination which does not always happen in a biography.

It was very well done, and gave some insight into the life of Augustine, an intellectual who spent his young life willfully denying Christianity and leading a very sinful life.  Eventually he sees the err of his ways, and rises to become one of the greatest defenders of the Church.  His mother Monica's life is also very inspirational, as she loves her son and her husband despite their failures, and gives us all a fine example of patience and trust in the Divine Assistance.  The acting was superb, the costuming and sets were wonderful  This must have been a high budget film.  I think you will like it.",1389139200,,723,4.690476190476191
6077251,5,B00GHU35HM,"Impossible to capture all of St. Augustine in a film but as Religious films go, it was really excellent. Well acted and visually good.",1388707200,18,134,4.625
6077252,5,B00GHU35HM,"I got this for myself as a Christmas present.  I have watched it already twice, and recommended it to anyone with ears.  It is so powerful, and so well done.  What a great story of the lives of two saints, St Augustine and his mother St. Monica.",1388534400,28,245,4.170212765957447
6077253,5,B00GHU35HM,"A real learning tool  to discover the life details of this remarkable saint.  He definitely shows how real sinners and unbelievers can find Jesus and believe so much that  souls are saved.  It gives hope to those who have children who have left the Church.  His mother, St. Monica, plays an outstanding role in praying continuously for her son's conversion.  This is a great movie for adults (in my opinion) as Augustine's behavior may not be suitable for small children.  There are lots of Augustine's in this world today.  The hope and truth is how he turns his life around to Jesus Christ.",1388188800,3,592,4.679611650485437
6077254,5,B00GHU35HM,"It must be a year since I saw this wonderful film in a theater, in a limited release.  It is disappointing that it has taken so long to come to DVD.

As per the Catholic News Service review by Adam Shaw, the film is ""a biographical profile of the holy bishop that manages to inspire while steering clear of sentimentality....[Before his conversion,] Augustine adopted the dualist Manichaean heresy....By his own later account, Augustine also gave way to debauched living.""

A shortcoming of the film is that it does not find better ways to somehow incorporate an explanation of such things as Manicheanism, so that the audience would have a better appreciation of this great bishop, philosopher, and saint.",1388016000,,706,4.966101694915254
6077255,4,B00GHU35HM,this movie is awesome but there are two main problems- The clarity to this movie is not good. While watching this movie we were constantly turning the sound up higher then lower. Plus there are no english subtitles on both versions of the movie. I hope they fix this soon because it is a great story,1387929600,4,299,4.357142857142857
8623401,2,B00GHU35HM,"Pretty low budget but ok biographical treatment of Augustine. I showed this to my 7th grade students and they thought it was cheesy. A few scenes were unnecessarily awkward like the empress's entertainers. Some scenes also were confusing. Overall it was good, but low budget all-around",1529193600,,285,5.217391304347826

8623409,5,B00GHU35HM,"Although not Italian like most of the other RAI religious films, Restless Heart will tug at your heart, humanity and spirit. Alessandro Preziosi and Franco Nero portray Augustine, an Italian citizen of the Roman northern African province. They capture the heart of a troubled man whowent as far away from God as one can only to come back to Him and become a priest, bishop and later, a saint. I knew something of St. Augustine but this film presents us the man who was a gifted orator, lawyer and a member of the emperor;a court. This film is beautiful to experience and deserves to be seen its entirity in one sitting. I chose the 203 original cut of the film.",1489968000,,661,4.516666666666667
