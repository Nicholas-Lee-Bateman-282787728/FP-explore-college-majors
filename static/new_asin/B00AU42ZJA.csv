have it you might try the Berlin Philharmonic website where I got mine.",1428451200,,312,4.886792452830188
8557810,5,B00AU42ZJA,"A stunning performance, highly moving. I was skeptical at first at the association of Peter Sellars with this piece, but in fact his staging (or ritualization, as it's called) is perfect. The soloists are wonderful, as are the choirs, all held together by Rattle's inspired leadership. Why Amazon doesn't sell this (except in a $333 import from Japan!) is one of life's little mysteries. Google around a bit and it's easy enough to find. So too is the more recent St. John Passion, from the same forces, though that apparently hasn't even entered Amazon's consciousness.",1426464000,2,570,5.010526315789473
8557811,5,B00AU42ZJA,"Electrifying, eviscerating, tender, transcendent. The unassuming Mr Padmore as the Evangelist is a revelation, but all the soloists are flawless.  I have never seen a more moving, committed performance of....anything.",1424476800,2,217,6.233333333333333

8557813,5,B00AU42ZJA,"One of the most sublime musical experiences in over 6 decades of listening. Flawless, profoundly moving performances from all concerned and a dramatic presentation to do justice to the subject matter.",1417737600,5,200,5.483870967741935
