8410264,5,0975882066,"This film is a phenomenal collection of old film footage and new interviews with people intimately involved with the ski industry. Passion is the name of the game whether shown by the dedication of early skiers who had to climb mountains to ski down, 10th mountain soldiers going in to battle in WWII, or disabled skiers running the same courses as the legends of ski racing.  As a Colorado skier, I was very impressed by the stories of how my state's ski business evolved...  And don't forget to look at the extra segments on this DVD...  This film deserves all the Awards and special recognition that it has received!",1407715200,,619,4.660550458715596
