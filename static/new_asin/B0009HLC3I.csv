8060917,5,B0009HLC3I,"A must-have for anyone interested in Bruce Goff's work.  Despite the informal production values and lack of narration, this film is a treasure.  Where else will you find such information in one place?  It's an excellent way to see a wide spectrum of his work - including a few interiors - that are otherwise not well-documented.  Highly recommended!",1486080000,,349,4.9655172413793105
8060918,3,B0009HLC3I,"Some good views of his building designs, but shot like a casual home video; traffic noise and vehicles,, etc. No evaluative comments. Would like to have know of the home-shot production.",1290038400,,186,5.032258064516129
