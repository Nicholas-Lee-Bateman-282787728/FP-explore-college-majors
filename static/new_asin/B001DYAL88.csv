8295415,4,B001DYAL88,"I purchased this for a friend who recently had taken up golf -- after not playing for 30 years. She found it extremely helpful, with drills that were easy to follow.  She also was able to isolate some particular problems she'd been having and with the help of the drills correct them.  I'd recommend this DVD to anyone who currently plays golf, is starting to play again or is just beginning to play.",1309737600,,400,4.465753424657534
