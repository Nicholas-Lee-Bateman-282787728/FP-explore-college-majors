8482412,4,B005P89GJS,"So excited to see Lucy's movies coming out on DVD! Although they're not the greatest movies out there, Lucy's talent certainly shines through them all. The funniest is ""The Fuller Brush Girl"" followed by ""Miss Grant Takes Richmond.""  ""Her Husband's Affairs"" bordered on drama and I'm not sure what ""The Magic Carpet"" fell into, although I read this was her finish up the contract movie.  All enjoyable and all Lucy!",1388448000,,415,4.914285714285715

8482414,3,B005P89GJS,"Prior to the existence of Mrs. Ricky Ricardo, a certain Lucille Ball had a thriving film career. As a contract actor of both RKO and MGM studios, she consistently garnered bouquets and encomia from critics representing many publications: from the august NY Times to Variety, the L.A. Times, the New York Herald-Tribune, and many, many others, all too numerous to list. At RKO (1935-42), the most financially precarious of the major five Hollywood studios, she progressed from extra, bit player, supporting actor, and leading lady to full-fledged star. Such was the faith possessed in her by RKO's executives, that she was cast in both dramatic and comedic roles, primarily in programmers or ""B"" movies. And so versatile was she, that Ms Ball achieved her highest accolades as a dramatic actress in such fare as RKO's ""Dance, Girl, Dance"" and ""The Big Street"" (finally, an ""A"" movie which co-starred Henry Fonda). After sojourns on stage (also to much praise) and at MGM, she was in a transitional period with a short-term contract at Columbia and with independent producers.

This set of four movies exhibits a Lucille Ball, just a few years prior to her remarkable TV success. Herein, one can discern the continuing evolution of her comedic talents which germinated in her Eddie Cantor days (1933-34) as an extra in his beguiling Goldwyn films. A gem of this package is ""Miss Grant Takes Richmond"" (Columbia, 1949) - just the title (with a reference to the Civil War) should pique your interest. A further enticement is her portrayal as the world's worst secretary - in spite of her character's having endured secretarial school. And the other films is this package robustly feature her talents - which never could be concealed on film in spite of weaker scripts.

Do NOT sit back and expect these films to enchant you, but rather sit straight and even lean forward toward the screen - in order to focus intently on her consummate discipline, expressive facial features, highly accomplished acting, and supreme comedic talent. By the way, this set of four DVDs has very few features and is austerely packaged - but it really doesn't matter at all as Ms Ball on film is more than sufficiently satisfying.",1347235200,4,2204,4.938005390835579
