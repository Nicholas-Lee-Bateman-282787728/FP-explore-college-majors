8220265,2,B000VWCDYI,The material is not presented in a organized fashion. The translated instruction is ok  but very hard to follow the movements as it is often too fast.,1515801600,,150,4.555555555555555
8220266,3,B000VWCDYI,"This video gets three stars for the demonstration part of the video which is very good..  As an instructional video it leaves much to be desired.  The majority of the techniques are done too fast to be of use as an instructional or review video., especially for beginning students learning the Jo.  The exact position of the hands (palm up, palm down) is not addressed and is difficult to follow at the demonstrated speed.  The footwork demonstration is useful.  The instruction part of the video would at best earn 2 1/2 stars.  The video might be a good demo for review for those who are learning these techniques from a qualified instructor in a class setting.  Some of the techniques could be learned from the video with a lot of effort and possibly running the DVD at slow speed of the DVD player allows that..  The credentials of the demonstrator are not  presented ! style ? (Aikido or other Japanese art?).  As a black belt holder and instructor  in a number of styles with experience with the Hanbo and Bo I still find this video disappointing.  This video could be greatly improved by slowly breaking down each technique to SLOW speed and repeating each technique more than once.  Closeups of hand position would be helpfull as well.  These improvements would be an asset to beginners as well as experienced martial artists.",1444348800,,1334,4.7186147186147185
8220267,5,B000VWCDYI,This is a fast moving training video  for use of Japanese shot staff with multiple segments including defense against a sword.,1401667200,,126,5.0
8220268,4,B000VWCDYI,DVD was delivered four days ahead of schedule. The instruction is fairly good. Unfortunately I was really looking for something more similar to Aikijo. But that is not a fault of the DVD. It would be better with an improved menu selection system and with a way to preview the actual video before purchase.,1379376000,,305,4.666666666666667
