6473506,5,B00L6AW0SI,"Growing up in the 1950's I have many fond memories of drive in theaters. Although some of the video was well worn, I enjoyed seeing all the promotions that theaters used to fund their business. I enjoyed the historical facts and other information that Roger Corman and the theatre owners had to offer.",1479168000,,301,4.69811320754717

6473510,4,B00L6AW0SI,I really enjoyed this movie about the drive in's. It brought back a lot of good memories of when I was a child and on up. I wish our drive in had not closed. It was fun to go to the drive in no matter what age I was. I watched it on Amazon prime. Thank you Amazon.,1474675200,,264,3.5689655172413794
6473511,4,B00L6AW0SI,very cool...big nostalgia factor from the 60s-70s. I remember our drive-in befor they tore it down in the mid 80s!,1474243200,,114,4.75

6473513,5,B00L6AW0SI,"LOVE this documentary!  As someone who lives in an area where there are still 4 active drive-ins within a hour's distance (and a few more a bit farther), I highly enjoy watching movies under the night sky.  This documentary goes through the history of the drive-in, really showing off it's heyday in the 50s and 60s (wow those theater screens were amazing!) to it's down fall in the 80s but ends on a high note with the slight resurgence in today's market.  If you love Americana type of history, this is definitely worth checking out.  Watched it on Prime, but will be ordering the DVD soon.",1472860800,,592,4.556603773584905

6473516,5,B00L6AW0SI,I love drive-ins and history. This gave me both. It's a little sad knowing how many drive-ins have gone dark but happy to see they are making a comeback even if it is in a small way.,1470787200,,182,3.945945945945946

6473520,4,B00L6AW0SI,Chronicles the existence of auto drive-in movies from their appearance in the 1930's to their growth and impact upon society as a family event. With the changing of times and youth culture more counter-culture/adult-type films appear at the drive-in. Gas crisis and smaller cars drive locations out of business. Then big $ is offer for property. At one point as man as five thousand locations existed but the numbers shrink. There has been a revival. If you have ever seen a movie at a drive-in the theatre you saw it at may appear here. Insightful.,1469145600,,549,4.7894736842105265

6473527,1,B00L6AW0SI,"It was interesting for me since I lived through that era, but all the old vintage pictures continually flashed off the screen in about 1 second.  That's not enough time to actually look at anything.  This was a terribly ineffective idea by whoever produced this and ruined the film.  The high-speed flashing of images was very annoying and gave me a headache.  I turned it off twice just to rest my eyes.  Only went back to it reluctantly.  Could have been a good documentary, was interesting subject matter, but very poorly done.",1463011200,,530,4.706521739130435

My daughter and I watched it when she came home from college for the weekend and after it she wanted to go to a drive in movie.  The following evening I drove the family 60 miles to the Silver Moon in Lakeland, FL, which was packed full.

6473551,5,B00L6AW0SI,This documentary reminded me of my teenage youth of a safe place to go and experience film with friends. I miss the grandeur the warm summer evenings and early fall outdoor movies are a lost treasurer. The only critic I will add is I wish there had been more film shots and a slower pan of each Drive-In marquee and footage of lined up cars waiting to get in. I have many memories and odd stories I could tell but to much to share here. Over all this film is educational and a fun trip down memories lane.,1448150400,,505,4.163265306122449

6473557,5,B00L6AW0SI,"I thought this was a really interesting documentary about drive ins. I LOVED drive in's when I was a kid and teenager in the 80's. Some of the drive in's in my town are still open, but alas many have closed. BUT, it seems a revival is starting and I think that's GREAT! Kids today, and even some adults, need to experience this wonderful concept. Adds a lot to the movie experience that you simply can't get in a theatre.",1444953600,,421,4.275

6473559,5,B00L6AW0SI,"That was really fun. I'm just old enough to remember going to the drive-in with my parents, already in pjs and scheduled to fall asleep during the movie. With four young children, it was probably the only way they got out of the house!

6473564,4,B00L6AW0SI,"For me, from the mid-to-late '60's,early '70's and occasionally in the '80's, this is well done nostalgic tribute of the life and times of yesteryear's Americana.
I don't remember the rent-able in-car heaters, probably because we had so many packed into the car, it was unnecessary.
I do remember the theater's window speakers showing up jury-rigged to eight-tracks in people's cars.

6473568,2,B00L6AW0SI,"This looks like a high school project. The aspect ratio is odd in places because of the way it was edited and the sound in many places is inaudible. Given that most good software packages today make very professional looking and sounding films for even the most amateur of film makers, I'm surprised this is so poorly done.  I like the subject matter, but the quality of the film itself makes it difficult to watch.",1439164800,2,415,4.533333333333333

Actually lived in a big city in NJ and when a girlfriend dragged me out to a far away drive-in because she had a friend who's parents ran one, I was hooked.  That was the first time in '70.  Then came the Woodstock movie.  After college I happened to buy a house past that far away drive-in.  So that drive-in was a once a month event along with another one on Rt. 9.  In the early 70's there were problems with that drive-in as the screen face the highway and a few accidents were caused by the X rated movies being shown.",1437782400,2,604,4.076271186440678

6473577,3,B00L6AW0SI,"Misleadingly subtitled The Definitive History of the American Drive-In Movie, this speedy but superficial documentary is just as much, if not moreso, a surface exploration of the history and cultural impact of that uniquely North American phenomenon, the drive-in theater. However, on both fronts, the film is outdone by several other docs -- all of which preceded it -- that benefit from uniform, even irreverent, directorial style, superior collections of talking heads, and more adept use of clips. On that last count, nearly all of Wright's archival clips -- most of which are employed in such rapid-fire bursts as to make comprehension of their content difficult without continually pausing the disc  -- bear all the softness and macro-blocking of direct downloads from YouTube or Archive.org with no attempt to source better masters (which do exist). Furthermore, careful examination reveals occasional clips snippets that are deceptively inappropriate to the era being discussed or the point being made, though casual viewers will be less likely to notice.

Wright's interview subjects are a likable mix of current drive-in owners (all of whom weathered the inevitable downturns of their industries to rebound, if somewhat shakily, into the 21st century as purveyors of nostalgia for aging boomers and their offspring), a generic academic whose primary source appears to be Wikipedia, the rather too young-ish owner of a website that celebrates drive-ins and, as the sole representative of the production and supply side of the equation, veteran B-movie titan Roger Corman, as willing as ever to provide the standard half an hour or so of his time to spin tales from his illustrious history that will be familiar to anyone who's viewed his appearances in the supplements of countless DVD and Blu-ray releases of his films, as well as in superior documentaries to this one. The most distracting thing about Wright's interviews is the lack of visual consistency brought on by her decision to shoot her subjects in whatever locations they happened to be in. Her framing is fine, but lighting, audio quality and subject positioning varies considerably from one subject to the next, leading to a certain degree of visual disconnect when she cuts between several of them in rapid succession. Also distracting is the ceaseless jukebox of excessively on-the-nose, ""nostalgic"" faux 1950's rock n' roll songs that permeates the film from beginning to end, and often threatens to drown out both the narrator (Wright herself, I believe) and the interviewees. The sole respite from this is the use of a piece of heavy-handedly portentous library scoring to underline the ""tragedy"" of drive-ins being shuttered and torn down in the 90's and beyond, many after decades sitting derelict anyway, which suggests they weren't particularly missed.

While Going Attractions seems to be a labour of love, it's not an overly committed one, and it spreads itself too thin trying to cover two histories in one, with neither getting the most effective treatment. As such, it's handily trumped by several other docs that trod the same ground earlier, and in higher fashion, including:

I also believe that anyone, whether they ever worked at a drive-in theatre or now, will also enjoy this DVD very much.

It was fairly close to our house. I often wondered what it would be like to go there... but let's face it, the REAL drive-in experience was in the 1950's & 60's. This documentary describes that time period well. Now I completely understand why Joe Bob Briggs would continually praise drive-in theaters on MonsterVision. It wasn't just a place to see movies... it was a whole culture onto itself. ""Buck Nights"", mosquito attacks, the failed autoscope business model... there's a lot of great info to absorb here.

Greatest memories of an incredible job as a teenager/young adult working the concession, my older brother working the projectors and then my 1st husband taking over the projectors and acting as ""bouncer"" to the rowdies in the back row LOL... Fun Times! We do have 1 remaining drive-in that is 40 miles from our home in Marshall, Arkansas called ""The Kenda"".....Kenda was named after the original owners daughter and her and her husband, Todd, have ran it for many many years. Sad that they had to switch over 3 years ago to total digital, due to no more celluloid films being made/distributed by the film companies. Would have been lovely to have had our 40+ year old local drive-in that is still open being represented on this spectacular documentary ""Going Attractions: The Definitive Story of the American Drive-In Movie""",1496102400,,965,4.962962962962963

I have fond memories of going to the drive-in with my family, falling asleep almost immediately being kids and going later when I was 18-20 years old. It's the reason I wanted to watch this. Bump some of the background music and it would feel more informative.",1491955200,,387,4.791044776119403
