8312119,5,B001J7OAJA,"Molly did a great review so this will be brief. Sewers of Gold AKA The Great Riviera Bank Robbery is a super hard to find, based on a true story, outstanding caper film which justified my purchase of this set alone. The Hard Way is excellent too, the 2nd best film in the pack with solid acting by Lee Van Cleef and Patrick McGoohan with a excellent supporting cast. Mr. Jerico is so, so and looks like it might have been a pilot for a TV show. No special features. All the films are by ITC/Granada. The packaging is excellent.",1424649600,,527,4.28

MR. JERICO: Patrick McNee is a world class con artist and while in Malta set up the ultimate SCAM~ with an Elusive Gem~ but along the way real gems and fake gems and more con artists add to the story and confusion~ played for laughs~ ADD Connie Stevens as the girl who has her own AGENDA~

THE HARD WAY:Patrick McGoohan is the ultimate assassin who wants to retire and he is forced to do ""one last job"" by his boss Lee Van Cleef. 5 STARS and lots of twists and turns.

SEWERS OF GOLD AKA THE GREAT RIVIERA BANK ROBBERY~Ian McShane is the clever ""brains"" who robs to support his fascist cause comes up with the clever plan to break into a bank and rob the safety depososit boxes for cash~ but he has to add the local robber to his gang~ they break in to the bank by going through the sewers of Nice~ very good movie moves along well. BASED on a real 1978 event. a bit of humor as the gang is whining how boring it is to count the loot. 5 STARS~ the last two movies are the BEST~ GREAT set of 3 nice movies in one nice package and great artwork. nice set~",1333843200,,1064,4.033175355450237
8312121,5,B001J7OAJA,I had been looking for this movie set in the USA and couldn't find it. I recently found it. This long search is over. The Hard Way is one of my favorites.,1326499200,,154,3.84375
