8517696,5,B007IOQPSC,"In Southern California, a man with a Halloween mask in his hands was babbling about a conspiracy as he's not making any sense as he ends up in a hospital somewhere. Dr. Daniel Challis (Tom Atkins) is puzzled about what he said then later sees him get murdered as he is still trying to solve the mystery of his death, he meets up with a lovely girl named Ellie (Stacey Nelkins) as the two head to a town called Santa Mira where it's home to a famous novelty/mask making company owned by Conal Cochran (Dan O'Herily) who is a very rich man but also a modern warlock who has deadly plans for Halloween eve that could kill all the children.

A very misunderstood and underrated Sci-fi horror shocker from producers John Carpenter and Debra Hill! Where's Michael Myers you say? well for starters, Carpenter said he hated writing Halloween 2 as he decided to kill him off permanatelly in the end of H2 by having Laurie shoot both his eyes out then have Dr. Loomis commit suicide by blowing him with Michael up thus Michael was burned to a crisp with Laurie living happily ever after as Michael's story was meant to be over. Carpenter and Debra Hill had a concept to turn the franchise into a big screen horror anthology (ala ""Are You Afraid Of The Dark"" or ""Tales From The Darkside"" or ""Creepshow"" or ""Grindhouse"") every year about the title holiday each season and this movie was the first and only attempt at that idea. Unfortunately he didn't inform the public about this idea thus when it came out audiences were confused and it bombed thus the anthology idea died a quick death. Personally i think this is a well made shocker with decent performances, a fine story and a great score by John Carpenter/Alan Howarth, i always liked this since i was 4 when my brother rented all 3 movies on video and enjoyed this one despite Michael was missing. But later in 2005 thanks to the internet, i found out the reason behind this movie and grow to love it more because of the anthology concept which would had been special as we could had gotten fresh and different Halloween themed horror stories, rumor has it that ""Fright Night"" was originally part of the idea plan before it got canned. I mean some of the other Michael stuff were enjoyable but got ridiculous as he was meant to be destroyed after part 2 accoring to Carpenter canon before he and Hill gave up the rights to Moustappha Akkad. The film has a HP Lovecraft/David Cronenberg feel with some fine gore, a memorable death scene and a creepy twist in the end as this movie combines sci-fi and horror together, it's worth a look because of the experiment this movie try to do with the franchise and now earns more respect because of the idea.

The blu-ray contains absolutely brilliant picture/sound quality with goodies like a documentary on the film, 2 audio commentaries, ""Horror Hallowed Grounds"" look at the locations of this movie, trailer/teaser, TV spots, radio spots and still gallery makes this blu-ray the definitive version",1350950400,3,2986,4.632075471698113
