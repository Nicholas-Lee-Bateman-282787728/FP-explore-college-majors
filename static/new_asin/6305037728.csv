961269,3,6305037728,"THE NEWTON BOYS is a well done period film, richly and warmly photographed and performed by a talented cast.  I still have a problem in ""justifying"" their robberies.  Willis' conclusion that he has been done wrong so he can do wrong too is not a quality I find admirable.  Stealing is stealing, and Linklater makes it look perfectly normal to ""cheer"" these boys on.  The fact that this is a true story only adds fire to the fuel of how we make heroes out of bad guys because they were ""cute"" or they got the ""system"", etc., etc.  Nough about that, though.  Matthew McConaughey, Skeet Ulrich and Ethan Hawke are splendid; they needed to give the excellent Vincent D'Onofrio more to do; Julianna Margulies was fascinating as Louise; Luke Askew in a great supporting role as the suspect-beating cop; and Dwight Yoakam as the friend who supplies the nitroglycerin.
The movie is a little long, drags some in the middle, but for a period piece, it's effective...just don't think these guys are heroes.  (The end credits with the real Willis and Joe is superb)",1083628800,3,1053,4.690217391304348
961270,4,6305037728,"I saw this in the theater and thought it was great, but no one else I knew had seen it. Then I saw it on DVD and bought it quickly. It was just as good as I remembered.
  This is a ""gangster"" movie without gangsters. No one gets killed or tortured graphically. It's a real life story of depression era brothers trying to get some cash and having some adventures along the way.
  I think Hawke puts in one of his best performances ever. Dwight Yoakam also contributes some good acting, especially when compared to his fabulous ""Sling Blade"" villan.
  The only flaw is the length. The movie drags a little after a while, but it still manages to make you care enough about the characters to see it through to the end.
 The final credits featuring Willis and Joe Newton at the end of their lives make the film worth owning. It's one of the most clever ways to make the credits worth watching I've seen.
  Give this movie a chance. It's well acted and is aesthetically pleasing to watch. Plus it's really low cost!",1048032000,31,1009,4.381720430107527
961271,4,6305037728,"Richard Linklater's The Newton Boys eschews much of the post-modern trappings that have defined the western genre in the nineties. Sure, it begins with a credits sequence that mimics the style of an old silent serial (complete with a fisheye lens), and it has one scene in which some of the eponymous boys are accused of stealing from a movie house (though they are never convicted), but the film's sensibilities seem much closer to those of the 1920's in which the film was set. It's an old-fashioned work, and that feeling is compounded by some wonderful documentary footage that plays during the credits. The comments of those involved in the actual events lend an immeasurable air of authenticity to the film.  It might be tempting to classify the film's identification with the bank robbers as post-modern, especially since Bonnie and Clyde essentially kicked off the modern era of filmmaking, but consider the fact that even 1903's The Great Train Robbery gave more screen time to its criminals than its posse.
That screen time tells a fairly standard story, and there are few genuine surprises to be found in that respect. Still, the movie isn't so much about plot as mood and character. This is the closest Linklater has come to making a Hollywood film, and he uses the resources to enhance, rather than ignore, his worldview. The cast is fairly excellent, with Ethan Hawke's drunkard being the standout. Matthew McConaughey has the largest role, and shows more charm here than in nearly any other film that he has been in. Although the film's setting is far from the modern day slacker world of Linklater's other films, the prevailing attitude seems to be the same. It's a mix of Texan charm and genteel sophistication. This treatment of the subject matter doesn't ever come off as cocky. It creates a wonderful sense of respect toward history. Several times, the Newton boys are allowed to state their socio-political justification for robbing banks. That they use flawed logic isn't the point. That they get a chance to make their case is. Linklater really isn't an astounding visualist (though the film is attractive) nor does he have a tremendous sense of pacing. What he does have is a humanist streak that runs throughout his films. Even when a double cross occurs in the film, he pauses to note that the traitor continued to assert his innocence. That genuine regard for his characters and fidelity to his setting are his strongest directorial traits. I'll take that over puffed up set pieces and quick cutting any day.",1005350400,10,2535,4.895348837209302
961272,4,6305037728,"I thought this film was great both times I saw it (once on video and then four days ago on TV). The general plot is that four brothers become bank robbers and are successful in many of their endeavors, but when they try to pull off the greatest robbery in history, somehow a couple things don't go as planned and it lands them in hot water. Matthew McGonaughey is perfect in his role as Willis Newton, and the rest of the cast is good as the other three brothers-Jess, Joe, and Dock- and the various people who are in league with The Newtons (especially Juliana Marguiles as Louise). In short, see this movie. You're bound to like it, and even though it has lots of action, it moves so lightheartedly that it kind of relaxes you too but also keeps your attention.
P.S. When I watched this on TV July 12, the network periodically showed commercials for the new John Stamos show, Thieves, which is also coincidentally about robbers, so I think I got a fuller experience the second time around.",997920000,2,991,4.480662983425415
961273,5,6305037728,"I thouht that this movie was a delight to watch.  Not only does it do quite a job presenting what it was like in the 20's, it also showed a (what I thought was a hearfelt story) of how brothers stick together.  The Newton Boys (Willis, Dock, Jess, and Joe) go through years of robbing banks, until they're caught after robbing a train.  Without giving away any of the plot, all I can say is that the Newton Boys bring you through a whole bunch of interesting and entertaining ordeals that will leave you feeling satisfied with the movie.",981676800,,537,4.404040404040404
961274,1,6305037728,"This film is a piece of garbage.  The storyline is mundane, the characterizations are weak, and the acting is almost non-existant.  I figured with such a great cast and director that this film would be great.  WRONG!  Richard Linklater's earlier films (especially ""Dazed and  Confused"" and ""Before Sunrise"") impressed me immensely.  Do  not rent or purchase this movie, and if it comes on cable change the  channel.  It can induce narcolepsy (instant sleep) and possibly brain  damage (it will at least make you feel dumber for spending $3 to rent it).",962064000,,552,4.967032967032967
961275,5,6305037728,"What is wrong with you people?  This movie is hysterical. Vincent D'Onofrio (the great under-appreciated character vet) and Ethan Hawke are the best, you have to see the ad-libs and particularly the scene where they rob the moneybags in Toronto. D'Onofrio gets tackled and Hawke ends up dragging around a man on his ankle like a  little kid on hanging on their mother. Ok, I'll watch anything with Vincent  D'Onofrio, but the movie is still great besides the fact that he, my  favorite actor, is in it. The movie is telling the true story, like it says  in the opening ...DUH..., so why are you expecting soapy dramatizations and  sex scenes when it's about them robbing banks and how they did it? I could  watch it again and again, unlike most of these hyped-up garbage movies  coming out of Hollywood now. See it or you're missing a piece of history!",953251200,44,852,4.633333333333334

962132,1,6305037728,"I selected this movie the other night, hopeful that the cast's agents would not have found them parts in a bomb. I hope the actors fired their agents over this one.
It's too bad, because I recall seeing the ads for the flick on TV and thought it looked like it would be good. Sadly, from the very beginning it sucked badly.... and got worse over time. To be fair, I quit watching it after about 45 minutes and I suppose it could have had a miraculous, Lazurus-like comeback. But I doubt it; this thing was DOA.
I think the filmmakers were aiming for a cross between The Sting, Paper Moon and Brother Where Art Thou. They didn't achieve that. Instead of being whimsical, simple and pure ... it was bland and flat.
I thought the script was amateurish and the direction poor. The decent actors could not save either element (but I am not sure how hard they were trying). I could not help thinking that the cast never actually rehearsed togehter, because they delivered their lines as if they had all practiced them the night before in front of a mirror. Kind of like we all did for our school plays way back in the day.
In fact, it had that kind of feel to it.

I love the interviews at the end of the movie, with the real Newton brothers, after they are old. Willis Newton never changed his philosophy of life, even in his 80s.  I believe if he was able, he would have robbed banks until he died of old age.
I thought it was interesting to see how difficult it was to capture these guys before there was good police communications and computer profiling like we have today. They could rob a bank, then go down the street and stay at the local hotel.",1408752000,,573,4.345794392523365

962960,5,6305037728,"When does a movie bromance become a wild ride, one that's sure to please? When stars Matthew McConaughey, Ethan Hawke, Vincent D'Onofrio, and Skeet Ulrich light up the screen. The chemistry between these four actors is undeniable; their portrayal of the brother-innocents is so believable, so seductive they carry us along on their grand adventure, and leave us rooting for a bunch of outlaws. In the end, it's been so much fun that we don't care. The tribute clip, from The Tonight Show featuring Johnny Carson, during the closing credits was pure genius; it reminds us that, although the boys' tale may be tall, it was also a true one. Mr. Carson's merriment is nostalgic and a nice cap on the movie's 'boys will be boys' theme.",1393459200,,730,4.755905511811024

963052,5,6305037728,"We need more movies like this one.  It is totally enjoyable, easy to watch and no deep thought required.  There are no overpaid actors hamming it up or overwrought actresses preening and trying to upstage one another.

What you do get is a fun look at a mostly true account of a ""gang"" of bank robbers that you will love.  The film has a touch of a sepia tinge and it helps you get into the time frame where the action takes place.

The main characters are really good-old-boys who need to rob banks to survive and really don't want to hurt anyone.  All the ""boys"" are great in their roles, but I think Vincent D'Onofrio, who is always wonderful, is totally under used.  More screen time for him would have elevated this little movie even more.

If you are tired of the overblown action movies with all the explosions, murders and gore splattered scenes, buy or rent this one--you will be glad you did.  It is in a word  -- charming.",1290902400,2,933,4.372093023255814

963087,5,6305037728,"The film is very banal. Bank robbers and postal train robbers, dj vu, blas, pass. Nothing particularly interesting or exciting. Yet the film has a slight flaw that makes it maybe of some interest. These bank robbers and postal train robbers survived the whole business in 1924, got through the trial with rather light sentences and they most of them died of old age fifty or so years later after giving, for some of them, some TV interviews about that profession of their young age. Then that was not a film but a fictionalized documentary. Shucks! Those who got the heaviest sentences were the few real profiteers who were the real organizers behind those young cowboys who got misled, by their own dream, into getting by force the money they desired to have. But the worst part in all that story is that they got caught on their last venture, the postal train robbery, because one of the gang of brothers shot another member of that brotherly gang because he did not stick to what he was supposed to do, went on the other side of the train and got frightened by someone who did not have the identifying hat they were all supposed to wear. A mistake, another mistake and the whole venture came to a stop, though they apparently did not recuperate all the money, neither the authorities, not the Newton Boys, because the part that was hidden away by one of them was done so under the influence of alcohol, not the money of course, but the Newton Boy who was supposed to bury it and he could never, so he says at least, remember where it was. If you are not afraid of the strong cowboy Texan accent of these boys, you can watch it and entertain yourself with the dream of what you could do with three million 1924 dollars. I guess you would favor buying a new hybrid car to be economical and nice with the planet.

963089,3,6305037728,"`The Newton Boys' is not your typical western.  Running more in the lines of `American Outlaws' then say `Unforgiven', `The Newton Boys' is in all respects a `fun film'.  It doesn't take itself too seriously.  It jokes around and rests heavy on comedic timing and a loud atmosphere.  The cast is young and fresh as apposed to mature and polished.  They are the `it' boys of the given year, cast to draw in a slew of teen viewers and boost ticket sales.  This is not an adult drama but more like a teen dramedy.  None of this is a bad thing; it's just a different thing.  I expected something more when I initially saw this when it was released, but after watching this again the other night I can see it for what it is and thus enjoy it even though it is not as good as it could have been, had it gone the more artistic route.

The film chronicles the infamous Newton boys, four brothers who became the most successful bank robbers in history.  They were not your typical heathens either.  They never killed anybody; they lived near respectable lives and never turned a fellow in.  They were likable people.  I'm sure they had flaws but this film is not about embellishing them for our enjoyment, this film is about making them as charming and approachable as possible, and they do that.  The very idea of casting Matthew `charming' McConaughey as the lead is a dead give away for the films intent.  So Willis, Joe, Jess and Dock rob nearly eighty banks and would have gotten away with it entirely if they hadn't decided to take one `last' job, a mail train, a robbery that got so botched they almost lost their lives but in the end just lost their fortune.

The acting is not too shabby considering the cast.  In fact Vincent D'Onofrio, who is arguably the best overall actor in the bunch despite his lack of `star power', has very little screen time in comparison to his co-stars yet the film still moves along fine.  Casting McConaughey as a Texas cowboy was smart since that's kind of what he is.  He is always charming even if he has less talent than most and here he uses his charm to help us forget he's riding fame on his looks.  Skeet Ulrich is decent as the apprehensive Joe, a far cry from his more famous role as Neve Campbell's killer boyfriend in `Scream'.  Julianna Margulies does her best to survive the at times horrific dialog and Dwight Yoakam does all he can to remain memorable in a film that doesn't care much for him.  The true highlight of this film though is Ethan Hawke who just nails his performance as Jess.  He's hilarious and enthralling.  In fact you can't keep your eyes off of him.  By far he gives the best performance of the bunch.

In the end `The Newton Boys' is not a masterpiece but it is not a waste of time either.  It's not the type of film you may be expecting considering the `darkness' of more current westerns but it has a `fun' factor and is at times purely delightful.  It's as charming as its stars and as entertaining as can be expected.  At times the dialog is rough, but it's nothing to mull over.  Just sit back and relax and enjoy have a rootin'-tootin' good time.",1197331200,,3118,4.40034965034965
963090,4,6305037728,"I saw this on HBO recently when I was home sick.  What a fun farce!  The four Newton boys and a safecracker manage to bumble through 80 bank robberies.  But things get serious when  they try to pull of a ""big"" job.

The acting is outstanding, but Dwight Yoakum and Skeet Ulrich turn in phenomenal supporting performances.  Yoakum plays the hypochondriac safecracker and Ulrich is youngest brother Joe. Ulrich has the most to do as he matures from baby brother to convict, while serving as the conscience, worrier, romantic, and accountant of the group.

The Texas accents were great.  Never once were the accents or speech distracting from the movie itself.  The music is also perfect for this movie.  It intensifies for a moment as something blows up, or you think something bad is about to happen, then it goes back to bum-bump.. dee bum bum bum-bump.

Whoever thought the line ""You're mean, you know that?"" was dumb, is missing the point.  These boys had guns full of bird shot.  They had no intention of hurting anyone, and when they were caught in the act and this lady wouldn't shut up, they worst thing they could think to do was call her mean.  Hilarious!

I think the film missed some opportunities for character development.  Doc was underdeveloped and Vincent D'Onofrio underutilized.  There was a subtle resentment from Jess towards Willis that could have been brought out.  I didn't like the stylized introduction.  But overall this movie was a blast.",1165276800,,1464,4.807228915662651

963094,5,6305037728,"I didn't see this movie when it first hit the theatres but, being a fan of Matthew McConaughey, Dwight Yoakam and Skeet Ulrich, I rented it when it became available.  GREAT, fun movie! And based on the true story of four brothers from Uvalde, Texas (where McConaughey was born) who were not only the most successful bank robbers in US history but ALL lived to ripe old age, unlike those that followed them a few years later, like Bonnie & Clyde, Dillinger, etc.  McConaughey, Ulrich, Ethan Hawke (excellent!) and Vincent D'Onofrio play the Newton Boys.  Dwight Yoakam is wonderful as their ""cowardly"" sidekick who handles the nitroglycerin the gang uses on their jobs.  Julianna Margulies has THE most beautiful 1920s costumes in her role as McConaughey's love interest, Louise.  The film also has the best honky-tonk soundtrack, courtesy of an Austin band called Bad Livers (get ahold of a copy if you can - it is SO worth it!) and during the closing credits, we get to see the real Joe and Willis Newton in interviews.  Joe's is particularly funny as he is on ""The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson"".  And the robbery the gang pulls in Toronto has GOT to be the funniest debacle in outlaw movie history!  There is a book available at Amazon entitled ""The Newton Boys"" which this film is based on and it's basically the oral history of the gang's exploits as remembered by Willis and Joe.  Makes for fascinating reading and one other bit of trivia - when Dock Newton (D'Onofrio's character) was in his 70s, in 1968 I believe, he tried to rob the First National Bank of Rowena, Texas which just happened to be the birthplace of one infamous Miss Bonnie Parker.  Just another great bit of American history not taught in schools.  Heck, even Frank Hamer, ALSO of Bonnie & Clyde fame, makes a ""cameo"" in this movie.  Just watch this movie and been amazed at one fascinating family!",1109376000,7,1876,4.685975609756097
