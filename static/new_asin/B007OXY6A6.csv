8519996,3,B007OXY6A6,"Though the plot is considerably far fetched, this film manages to develop an unlikely love story spanning seven or eight years and two continents! Aditi Rao Hydari and Ali Zafar have an interesting chemistry and charm. I always love movies shot on locations I know. The music by Ali Zafar is outstanding and the music video of London Paris New York at the end is my favorite!",1395187200,,375,4.611940298507463
8519997,5,B007OXY6A6,"The film is very realistic. The dialogues are so relevant to what you expect to happen in life. The characters make mistakes in  life and learn from them.
The songs are composed by the main actor, Ali Zafar. I like the music a lot including the story of the film. great acting.. everything is nice- short, simple story. Ali Zafar is handsome. He is a singer and actor in reality.",1367366400,,379,4.414285714285715
8519998,4,B007OXY6A6,"Romantic soul that you are, stop me if you've heard this one before. Two twenty-something students have a chance encounter at the airport. Lalitha Krishnan (Aditi Rao Hydari) is a middle class south Indian girl from Chembur on her way to attend university in New York. Nikhil Chopra (Ali Zafar) is a rich kid from Bandra, a bit spoiled and an aspiring filmmaker enroute to London academy. Lalitha is a self-avowed feminist, earnest and prim and proper. Nikhil is the fun-loving sort, never shy in a crowd. You'd think they have nothing in common. And yet, with Lalitha's flight to New York not until the following morning, they end up spending a day (and a night asleep on a park bench) together in London. Lalitha and Nikhil are become mutually smitten. They exchange a kiss. They make a pact to meet again in New York in six months' time. This doesn't happen. Hearts break. Two years later, they'll meet again, in Paris. And years after that, a third time, in New York City.

In some ways, LONDON PARIS NEW YORK echoes BEFORE SUNRISE and ONE DAY. The narrative spans eight years and details Lalitha and Nikhil's three run-ins with each other, three distinct chapters that prove the sum of their tempestuous friendship and romance. If you want to dig deeper, I guess you can say that each meeting marks a key stage in the pair's development and maturity.

I guess it's worth repeating that Bollywood has increasingly produced more modern pictures. LONDON PARIS NEW YORK is a movie I really got into. Its perspective is contemporary. The mood is lighthearted and romantic but not overwrought. The dialogues unfold in conversational form, no tearing out of hair here while delivering histrionic speeches. At least not in the film's first half. Post-intermission it leans towards a more traditional Bollywood script. As things get more dramatic, the speeches get more, um, filmy. Having said that, someone needs to tell Ali Zafar he was terrific in his emotional flare-up scene. His calling her a tease (the ""tease"" preceded by an ugly word) was a bit jarring and off-putting... Except Zafar's character, in that moment, seemed genuinely hurt, so that explains his cruel lashing out. It's a powerful scene that adds depth to the story.

I didn't know the two leads from jump. I'd no clue that Ali Zafar is a Pakistani pop star breaking his way into the Bollywood industry. Zafar wears multiple hats for this project. He not only acts in this film, he also composes the music, writes the lyrics, and sings the songs. More importantly he demonstrates amazing chemistry with Aditi Rao Hydari. Aditi Rao flutters my heart, makes me want to invest in a defibrillator. She's stunning and immediately threatens to elbow Genelia D'Souza aside as Bollywood's freshest face. She's a natural onscreen. She captures each moment, whether the moment calls for demureness or brazenness or an aching vulnerability or searing pain. Watch her go from self-consciousness to sophistication, from wide-eyed to been-around-the-block. It's unfathomable that she'd been languishing in supporting roles. LONDON PARIS NEW YORK gives her her first lead part.

""Woh dekhne mein kaisa seedha-saada lagta
Hai bolta ki woh toh kuch nahi samajhata
Andar se kitna tezz hai
Kabhi ajeeb sa, kabhi haseen lagta
Kabhi kisi kitaab ka hai scene lagti
Philosophy ka crazy hai""

I don't know what those lyrics mean, but they belong to my latest favorite Bollywood track (""Woh dekhne mein""). The songs may not have been chart-toppers but they resonate more within the context of the film. That's because some of the songs are sung by the two leads themselves. Zafar and Hydari sing a duet in ""Thehri Si Zindagi,"" but, really, the two catchy songs are the title track and the melodic and laid back ""Woh dekhne mein,"" at first sung by Zafar early on and then by Hydari late in the film. Hydari's stripped-down, almost acoustic version is the one that resonates more, and partly because it IS a callback to Zafar's earlier rendition. ""Woh dekhne mein"" - both versions - is gonna stick around on my iPod for a bit.

Oboy, there's lots of talking. She's an opinionated feminist. He's sort of this pretentious filmmaker (he smugly references Andrei Tarkovsky). But Zafar and Hydari are likable, so the dialogue doesn't drag too much. He addresses her as ""Hey, Lonely Planet"" and ""Lalithapedia"" for her bookish, sometimes introverted ways. She retorts by telling him to shut up. Ah, chemistry.

I hated that the Moserbaer ad kept popping up for seconds at a time throughout the film. (Moserbaer is a Bollywood cinema distributor.) As for the movie itself, one of my few nitpicks - and SPOILERS now for the rest of this paragraph - is that the story doesn't really go into why Lalitha has such a change of heart and welcomes Nikhil so warmly in New York (she had stormed out on him in Paris). I guess time heals all wounds. But did she come to regret her vindictiveness in Paris or did she choose to let bygones be bygones? It would've been nice to have seen a brief scene clarifying the nature of Lalitha's thawing.

Note that the language is Hindi, although there's an option for English sub-titles. LONDON PARIS NEW YORK runs at an hour and 41 minutes, shocking in its brevity for a Bollywood picture. Because of its sensibilities, it may appeal more to westerners than to its native audience. There are no annoying relatives (until the end) to disapprove their getting together or to wax histrionic. There are bouts of kissing and even a tastefully done sex scene (no nudity). Somewhere Nick and Ambar are poking fun at the uproar. Their sexy shower scene in SALAAM NAMASTE was more suggestive than that.",1356998400,3,5656,4.853886010362694
