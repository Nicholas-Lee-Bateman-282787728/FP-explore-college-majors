I have been waiting for them to come to DVD in the complete series. this is all I need to complete my childhood series.  Watching all the movies I did as a child makes me feel the way I did as a child, this helps me to temporarily forget about the problems of today.",1463961600,2,382,4.148648648648648
8148288,3,B000J0OP7K,"Ray Walston revealed that when the show, My Favorite Martian, intended on bringing back the visiting nephew, Andromeda (called Andy for short), the network cancelled the show.
So what happens next? A cartoon is made INCLUDING the nephew!
Actually this animated version wasn't as discouraging as the one-episode live nephew was (the live version was just rather bland, whereas the cartoon version to a young viewer bordered on an Archie take)
My Favorite Martian was from the same company as the ARchie cartoons, so you will hear the same stock music and similar voices.
In truth, Andy the martian is pretty much just Archie Andrews, the newly added humanoid Katie is Betty and so on.
We now have Jonathan Harris of Lost In Space doing Uncle Martin's voice and Howard Morris (Ernest T. Bass on Andy Griffith) doing Tim's voice, originally Bill Bixby. Not sure what ear heard Howard Morris in Bill Bixby tho.
Episode-wise, these run rather bleak. They weren't that fun at six years of age.
In the live show, we had Inspector Brennan. Here, doesnt matter if it is the same name or not, character is completely overhauled into a bungling George Wilson figure in a trenchcoat with a magnifying glass, spying thru windows, delivering ""Gyahhh!"" noises when things disappear, and to further cliche' the effect, he has a REggie Mantle sidekick, (as tho this is a rival for Katie's affections from Andy?) and a monkey in a sweatshirt (that I did NOT remember) who was a foil for the martian dog, Odie.
Now Odie is what we liked from the show, tho we watched it on a black and white tv, and in color, he is pink!
But he did funny growling noises and talking, floated in the air, his doghouse was Doctor Who's tardis (bigger on the inside than out).

One of these episodes is mucked up with other animals talking verbally. Either keep the animals as so, or reduce them to Ranger Smith status, not speaking (further confusing things, the animals were a bird, a cat and a dog, like a joke was lost or something).

When I watched the second episode, I immediately remembered Uncle Martin's description of 'positive Andy, negative Andy and indecisive Andy' tho I don't understand why indecisive Andy was smaller than the other two.

Shlocky seventies cartoon, yes. Good watch? No.",1316217600,5,2264,4.770408163265306
