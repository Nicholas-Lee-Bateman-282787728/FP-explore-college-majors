2311071,5,B0009PVZHS,"Loosely based on first time writer/director Robert Hall's own life,this film centers on a young wannabe horror movie makeup artist(Brett Harrison) and his dream to escape life in his small southern town. Complicating matters are an abusive stepdad and a town full of folk who see him pretty much as the devil himself. Laura Prepon(Donna,""That '70s Show"")plays a pretty video store clerk who falls for the young man,but who has a secret or two of her own. Hal Sparks(soon to be ex-Michael,""Queer as Folk"")plays the local town deputy and is quite good....and very funny. I had the pleasure to see this,at a gathering of fellow Hal Sparks fans,back in September 2004 and have been waiting for the DVD.This is a definite must have in your DVD collection.",1117843200,4,750,4.913385826771654
2311073,5,B0009PVZHS,"This is an excellent watch.  Robert Hall wrote and directed this flick and it works.  Most films that are supposed to be frightening are filled with gooey monsters that are not real and fake blood.  The scariest monsters are the ones that live among us unnoticed and when they go off it is shocking and frightening. Inbreeding doesn't help and there may be some in this movie.
This is Napoleon Dynamite meets Night of the Hunter. One of Kevin Gage's best roles!",1338508800,,461,4.597560975609756
2311074,2,B0009PVZHS,"Truth doesn't necessarily make for a good movie. This movie has a lot of champions. I'm not one of them.

Here's the scoop. Green Graves is moving, with his mom and younger brother, from Detroit to Alabama. Mom wants to start a new life and Green wants to become a special effects artist in Hollywood. That road is more difficult than he would have imagined.

I found this a very mean spirited movie. Most of the characters are nasty in any number of ways. And they are written in many of the cliches bandied around about the Southern U.S. They are incestuous, drunk, self righteous, bible thumping, ignorant trailer trash. Mom wants to start a new life, but the first male she hooks up with is a woman beating drunk who holds a mean, iron fist over the household. Green is learning his craft but is considered evil by the local religious folk because of it and it causes him great harm. He falls for a local girl (Laura Prepon) who has her own problems and has a mother who is such a good Christian she'll lie to the authorities to get Green thrown in jail. She is so religious shell bust up his haunted house display with a sledge hammer. This is ugly through and through. There are a couple of good souls in this movie, but not enough to balance out the nastiness.

This is a low budget film and it should get some commendation that they even got it made but it hurt for me to watch. Some of the acting was good. Some of it was awful. The music was generally pretty awful and the camerawork was pretty bad as well. The lightning bug metaphor was OK I suppose but not enough to help this mess out.

This is based on the true story of the writer director. Maybe he should have let someone else handle it. Someone who would have had enough distance from it to know how to shape it into a good story.",1316736000,,1799,4.2823529411764705

2311076,5,B0009PVZHS,"Just saw Lightning Bug and wow, it was so much better than I expected. I generally have low expectations of independent films unless they've gotten a lot of buzz. I checked this out because I'm a fan of Reaper and Bret Harrison's work. Bret plays Green Graves, a teenager in Alabama with dreams of becoming a special effects horror movie artist. Of course he's very talented but has a challenging home life and only wants to escape his town. He has great chemistry with Laura Prepon (from That 70's Show) who plays his girlfriend.

I liked that while it was unrated and could have been gratuitously violent, profane, etc., it wasn't. There's language of course and some horror elements and gore but everything was appropriate to the story and not hard to watch at all. It's just a great human drama with realistic characters that's loosely based on the writer/director's own life. He's Rob Hall, and has done the special effects for Buffy and Angel.

Fabulous casting, Bret's character was just loveable in the lead (He so often plays these moral, smart, sweet, vulnerable kids. He's perfect in that role). It was a terrific story and moved along at a great pace, never dragging. I liked the cut and the direction a lot. I'm going to watch it again with the commentary but there are excellent deleted scenes with commentary, a making of documentary and outtakes on there too. It's a great DVD package, and I got it for about $8 with shipping from amazon marketplace. Totally worth it.  I recommend that any fan of Bret's pick this up. Tremendous performance from him.",1221609600,,1567,4.732600732600733
2311077,5,B0009PVZHS,"I just saw this movie and I am still sitting here stunned. I loved this movie. It really brings together who really are the ""demons"" in one's life. Being raised with this mentality myself, and spending many hours in therapy to rationalize what had happened to my childhood, I can sympathize with anyone that goes through this kinda ""torment"" and celebrate thier freedom when they are out of it. This movie is very like real life and very believable to the last second. I recommend this movie to anyone that has had hopes and dreams to achieve with minimal support and finally gets what the person wanted. Achievement!!!!!",1167609600,5,621,4.7592592592592595
2311078,4,B0009PVZHS,"I just saw this movie .WOW I really liked it, cast they done great job, acting & cast was SUPER!!!!!!!!!

This guy, have  talent for Halloween mask , special effects & makeup he makes, with the real ""disturbing""  scary life drama he has, really got me in edge my seat and didn't let me go till end with a little twist I never thought going to gets like that...Really liked it!!

I gives this movie with great scrip and cast a B+

2311079,3,B0009PVZHS,"It's a odd but well done little movie. This young man wants to become a special effects artist. He's very good at making horror masks and scary creatures. You can't help but feel for the guy. His mom is...well...white trash. And the people around him are too. The people around him are so cartoonish it bothered me. But they did make them more real as the movie evolved. They became more real and likable. I could feel for his mother at the end.

One person besides the main character who was authentic was his girlfriend (acted by Laura Prepon of That '70s Show fame). At times, it seemed as if there are two normal people surrounded by the strange denizens of the small town they live in. Perhaps that was done intentionally.

This movie is a fine effort at being unique. It's a drama with touches of comedy and horror. It comes across as a B movie but again I think that was intended to feel that way.",1154736000,,904,4.375
2311080,5,B0009PVZHS,"This movie was filmed close to where I live.  I honestly wasn't sure how good it was going to be.  I was very suprised.  This is an excellent movie!  The story is well written, the characters are so real that it was easy to forget that I knew some of the locations in the film!  I have watched it about 4 or 5 times already and would recommend it to ANYONE who likes down to earth suspense in small town locations.  Truly a wonderful movie.",1152057600,,440,4.117647058823529
2311081,5,B0009PVZHS,"I rented this movie from my local video store because

I am a fan of Laura Prepon. Lightning Bug  might not have drawn my attention otherwise. I like the movie and bought it to ""vote with my dollar"" in support of independent film makers.  That 70'Show began airing when I was completely disgusted with TV for glamourising stupid dysfunctional BS. T7S is still one of very few shows I watch and I am still mad at Fox for screwing over Grounded For Life!

Lightning Bug is a permanent addition to my movie collection. The other customer reviews which slam it are full of crap,in my humble opinion. Mark in Indianapolis.",1135900800,,617,4.581818181818182
2311082,4,B0009PVZHS,"Lightning Bug is a movie that is painful to watch, but only in a good way. The semi-autobiographical story of Robert Hall himself, this movie follows one young man's journey to find himself and perfect his art as everything around him is in a constant state of flux. However, life is rarely like Hollywood, and Hall makes no attempt to make this story a pat Hollywood `boy saves everyone and himself' story. Still, the characters themselves are very real, and the story is too compelling to rip yourself away from.

Both Bret Harrison and Laura Prepon give remarkable performances that show their range as actors. The directing and editing make the film fast paced and consuming.

Still, this isn't a feel good movie. It's someone's like told in naked and brutal detail and that's where the magic of this film lies.

2311084,5,B0009PVZHS,"This movie is an excellent drama/thriller/horror. Meet Green Graves, eighteen year old, uneducated poor child that lives with his mother and brother in a trailer. He has dreams of becoming a makeup artist in Hollywood. He struggles with a nasty step father, a troubled girlfriend, nice but stupid mother, zealots, and other obstacles. Its quite a touching movie with a strong message never give up. I would highly reccomend it.",1129507200,,427,5.114285714285714
2311085,1,B0009PVZHS,"This is my first Amazon review, and I'm writing it to help you save a few bucks.

This movie follows a simple formula:

bad plot + bad dialog/script + stereotypes + bad acting = bad movie

As a horror/indie film fan, I had high hopes for this film.  Within the first few minutes, I could have predicted how the entire film would unfold.  I would have turned it off, but I kept watching just to laugh at scenes that weren't supposed to be funny.

The acting is stiff and fake, but I think this may be due in large part to the poor dialog.  See, e.g., the salty tongue of the abusive stepfather.  Or the hillbilly farmer who runs the local spook house.  The best acting comes from the little brother, played by Lucas Till.

It's somewhat amusing, but really pathetic, that Robert Hall writes entire scenes to demonstrate that southerners are incestuous, drunken, Bible-thumping trailer trash.  And some of the characters are so entirely over the top as to be ridiculous (e.g., Laura Prepon's mother running around with a pillow to represent her deceased husband).  There's nothing genuine about this entire film.

Thankfully, Robert's semi-autobiographical character (the only enlightened one in this galaxy of hicks) is able to rise above his trashy upbringing and pursue his dreams.  It's too bad that Robert decided to venture beyond his makeup career and make a film about his youth.

If you want to see well written, well executed films that follow some of these same themes, please try Ulee's Gold and Sling Blade instead.

The only positives of this film:

1) it has a King's X song in it

2) Ashley Laurence and Laura Prepon are attractive

That's it.  Save your money.",1129161600,10,1675,4.710344827586207
2311086,3,B0009PVZHS,"""Lightning Bug"" is a surprisingly good character drama that exposes domestic violence and the struggle of a loveable gang of Southern rejects against their personal demons.  Green Graves family is poor but, it doesn't stop him from practicing his talent.  Angevine Devit's family is rich but the grass isn't so green in her yard either.  It goes to show you that real friends can transend egos and social class.  Green also represents the ""normal"" horror movie viewers.  Jenny Graves, played by Ashley Laurence, really is trying to understand her son.  Funny how she picks up a Fangoria magazine with Hellraiser II on the cover.  Her character broke my heart it was played so well.  Ashley's acting goes far beyond that of Kirsty Cotten of the Hellraiser series.  Her character and acting were very genuine.  It broke my heart to see get her life in order only to have it destroyed. It's all too real.  All the characters were genuine.  That is what makes this film so good.  The actors were very well chosen and the story was very honest. Who knew Laura Prepon would look so hot dressed all gothy... grrrrr. Ashley laurence is still the hottest.  The film goes beyond a good looking cast of good actors.  It's one of the best independant drama's I've seen in a long time.

The forshadowing and backtracking sequences could have been edited in better but the films simple story and filming don't take away from the emotions.

I have to say if you like emotional dramas, not to unrealistic and stupid like your teen sisters bitchfests, try this film.  Horror fans will find a kin to Green Graves and his desire to work in horror movies and adore Asheley laurence and see her in a new light.

8 out of 10.",1127001600,,1703,4.635451505016722

2311089,4,B0009PVZHS,"A hopeful future often travels together with the notion of dreams and aspirations.  This is often depicted out of the perspective of youth seeking a direction on their journey through life.  Often it is a difficult journey, which can even be harder to commence while parents, friends, and other people of various significance begin to affect the decisions of those who are coming of age.  Lightening Bug touches on this very theme in a remarkably clever manner, as it deals with a young man's desire to leave his small Alabama home for a better life elsewhere.

A criminal suggestive opening leads the audience into think of why and who are the people involved in the scene.  The identity and motive of the people involved in the wrongdoings are not revealed, but it leaves the audience wondering and thinking.  These notions will leave audience's with an ominous sense of forthcoming trouble, but when and where remains unknown until the appropriate moment when the audience least expects it.  The audience might have the ability to guess why and who is behind the suggestive opening.  However, the director and writer Robert Hall delivers several situations in the film that continue to cloud the audience's judgment and logic to get a clear idea of who and why.  This displays that Hall has thoughtfully put together an intriguing story for the audience.

Shortly after the troubling opening, the audience gets to witness Jenny Graves (Ashley Laurence), who many will recognize from Hellraiser (1987), arrive to Alabama from Detroit with her two sons.  Jenny seems to have fled something, which is never revealed, as they arrive to their new home in rural Alabama.  In addition, her older son Green wonders if they can go trick or treating, but Jenny informs her son that they have missed Halloween.  This might suggest why Green later in his late teens has such a fond attachment to this frightful holiday and to horror.

The film quickly moves forward into the late adolescence of Green (Bret Harrison), as he turns 18 and has discovered that he has an artistic talent that he uses to create frightful creatures and other horrific creations.  However, most people in his small town seem to be in complete disconnection with the world while Green has to face this ignorance on a daily basis.  Oppression by an abusive stepfather and Christian persecution are some of the difficulties that Green has to struggle with while also thinking of his little brother and mother's well being.  There are many chains that keep Green from beginning to bloom artistically while the greatest of them is misconception and ignorance of people in his environment.

In the woods outside Green's trailer home, he can find small lightening bugs that give him a chance to separate himself from the ignorance of the small town.  It also allows him to play and have fun, which provides a chance for hopes and dreams.  Green desires nothing else than to work in the film industry creating monsters and other horrific beasts to create a fright, or scare within the audience.  However, can he break the chains that keep him in the small Alabamian town in which he grew up?

Lightening Bug is a small film that completely missed the theaters, but now is released on DVD.  It is fortunate that some of these independent films get an opportunity to be seen, as this one delivers an amusing and intelligent story that deals with coming of age and the social pressures of being a teen.  It also has a mild dose of existentialism, as it addresses the issue of choosing a direction in life.  In one of the opening shots the audience can see a car chose a direction while approaching a fork in the road.  This very scene could symbolize the importance of choosing the right path for oneself, as the individual will only have the opportunity to live the life of oneself.  Thus, it is essential to seize the day, and live a life to the fullest while staying true to oneself.  Lastly, the ill-omened opening continues to linger throughout the film, which adds another intriguing ingredient to the film.",1124409600,10,4069,4.8158273381294965
2311090,3,B0009PVZHS,"Bret Harrison (Tv's Grounded For Life) is a young buck who has a fascination with horror movies and he has the gifted talents to create special effects makeup and what he wants to do is make it big in Hollywood but first he has to suffer in a small town where he suffers from being poor and his Mother, played by Ashley Laurence marrying a total jackass abusive violent Stepfather, played by Kevin Gage (Dee Snider's Strangeland, Heat). Harrison has friends in town and along with his little brother and his friends, they sometimes go around catching lightning bugs. Harrison falls for movie store girl, played by Laura Prepon (Slackers, Tv's That 70's Show) who has a religious mother who's husband died, so what she does is carry a pillow around with her all the time, sleeps with it and even gives it a kiss or two. Harrison then has a spot to create with his talents the huanted house but the towns people are really not that interested in what he does. Hal Sparks (Queer As Folk, VH1'S I Love The 70's, 80's and 90's) has a fun role as the annoying Deputy of the town and he also manages a morning talk show and Josh Todd (The Salton Sea, lead singer of the band Buckcherry) has a small role as Gage's cousin. Interesting story has it's plot holes here and there but the main thing is that Harrison gives a good enough performance here along along with Prepon that it doesnt even matter, to me. Best scene would have to be when Harrison defends his mother away from Gage after he's slapping her around and then comes the good part where Harrison punches right threw the window knocking Gage on his ass...I thought that was the best part.",1123891200,,1642,4.476666666666667

Her character doesn't come in for almost the first twenty minutes, but then she has a solid role the remaining 1 hour and 10. No full nudity from her, but there are some steamy worthwhile scenes. She gives a GREAT performance as well. Talented young lady.

On another note, the film is nice. It is a good story of a talented, kind young man and his struggle with living in poverty and in an abusive home. It is the life story of Robert Hall who has done makeup for Teen Wolf and Buffy the Vampire Slayer. It is definitely a low-budget feel. There are some heart-tugging moments though. I recommend.

8064996,5,B0009PVZHS,"Green Graves only dreams of becoming a special make-up effects artist for the movies, but his dreams are shattered by an abusive stepfather and the disenchanting denizens of his small Southern town. Renown special effects artist Robert Hall delivers this powerful fictionalization of his own childhood experiences in the 2004 drama, LIGHTNING BUG. Hall speaks with raw emotion through his heartfelt characters, painting a tragic true-to-life tale that is equally inspiring. This could not be achieved without the help of his incredible cast, led by Bret Harrison and Kevin Gage. Harrison loses himself in his character, bringing his full range to the role of Green. He could only be overshadowed by Kevin Gage as the monstrous Earl Knight, who presses his terrifying strength and oppressive control over Green and his family. Gage is more frightening in all of his drunken rage than any man or monster in the genre. Laura Prepon, Ashley Laurence, Hal Sparks, and Lucas Till provide stunning support as well, and help to sell the realism of the desperate small town condition. A great debt is also owed to Brandon Trost, Joshua Charson, Rob Prior, and the rest of the talented crew, who make Green's reality our own. LIGHTNING BUG has a reach that expands well beyond the genre, but Horror fans in particular will empathize intimately with Green's personal struggle in an unaccepting society. This is Robert Hall's love letter to movie making, and his own personal masterpiece beyond the realm of make-up and special effects.
