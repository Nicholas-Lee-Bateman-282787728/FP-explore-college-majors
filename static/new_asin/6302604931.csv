486915,5,6302604931,"Robert Taylor and Richard Widmark make excellent opponents in this tale of an ended partnership, Taylor having gone straight and Widmark a confirmed outlaw.  Both Taylor and his fiancee Patricia Owens get abducted by Widmark and company because Widmark wants $20,000 in gold that Taylor buried just before he reformed.

John Sturges directed ""The Law and Jake Wade"" with the same skill he brought to other westerns.  The story moves quickly and use of California desert and mountain locations is outstanding.  Unfortunately, some night scenes were filmed using indoor sets which not only don't look real but have painted scenery not geographically compatible with the actual photography.  Having pointed this out, I am willing to make allowances.

Richard Widmark had a unique style of villainy--clever sarcasm, slight hesitations in delivery of his lines, and, yes, we do get to hear him giggle a few times a la Tommy Udo from ""Kiss of Death"".  He was also a master of sudden mood changes, going from pleasant to homicidal in a few seconds, and always believable.

As great as the contributions of the stars and director are, I have to give top credit for the success of ""The Law and Jake Wade"" to screenwriter William Bowers.
Bowers chose to have Widmark's outlaw be a master of dry wit.  Bowers later had James Garner speak in much the same manner, albeit as the hero, in ""Support Your Local Sheriff"".  Some of what Widmark says is borderline anachronistic but that only adds to the interest.  Widmark's character is not fun--he's actually quite psychotic--but his way with words is still very clever.

Henry Silva is also in this.  Like Widmark, he's supposed to be a really nice guy and family man in real life, but you'd never know it to see his movies.

""The Law and Jake Wade"" is not a top western classic but it still ranks quite high.  It's worth seeing just to find out why Widmark's character never got to go to the Swiss Alps, and has other content to set it apart from usual Western fare.",1231027200,2,2002,4.76231884057971

  The western movie ""The Law and Jake Wade"" is a classic movie.  The western films always have the good and the bad; and supports crime does not pay.  This is a typical classic western film that portrays the Hollywood of the past, with a super cast in Robert Taylor and Richard Widmark.

486919,5,6302604931,"The source of this very good film released through MGM on June 6, 1958, was a book written by the incomparable Marvin H. Albert. Mr. Albert has written many westerns (Clayburns) and mysteries (Lady In Cement), with many brought to film (Duel At Diablo & Tony Rome), from novels that are very near classics of the writer's art.

This film was shot on location in California's High Sierra Mountain Range, Lone Pine location, and in Death Valley.  Both the filming sites and the actors allow great realism in this western.  The 88 minute film was shot in both great color and wide screen.

For Robert Taylor (1911-1969) this film would be one of the better ones he had left to make, with Richard Widmark (1914-2008) having yet a longer string of films to make with some very good ones to come.  Neither actor could have had any bad feelings concerning their stellar performances in this film.  Both Taylor and Widmark do show their age somewhat in this film, however, their combined performance is a veritable thing of beauty to behold.  For one seeing this film for the first time elements of suspense are encountered with the ending scoring a point for the 'good guys' believing in rule of law.

Great story, sustaining suspense, admirable locations, and a plethora of very good actors, help turn this western story into more than just a western. The label 'classic' isn't too far behind this movie.  All-in-all, Hollywood seldom did a western any better than THE LAW AND JAKE WADE.  Watch it and you will probably understand why I enjoyed this one so much.

486920,4,6302604931,"Not a classic like ""my Darling Clementine"" or ""High Noon"", of course, but this film has a lot to offer.  Richard Widmark always made one of the best villains in the movies.  He really puts on a show in this film, as the leader of a former Civil War guerilla outfit that just kept on robbing banks after the war ended.  Widmark, and the scipt, give the character a borderline psychotic persona, with a 1950's-ish vague hint of homosexuality in his obsession with his former second in command, played by Robert Taylor.

Taylor, playing the lead and title character in this movie, was a somewhat limited actor, often appearing stiff and wooden in his roles, though that did not keep him from getting some of the best movie roles of the 1950's - Ivahoe int he movie of the same name, Marcus Vinnicius in Quo Vadis.  And he made some highly entertaining action films in the post-war years.  In this film his unemotional stiffness works in his favor, as his character is unusually stoic, even for a western ""hero"".  Not that Jake Wade is exactly a typical western hero.  He used to be the gang's second in command, but now he's trying to reform, having become a well respected sheriff and engaged to one of the towns most eligible single girls.  This film was probably the aging Taylor's last really good big screen role, and he pulls it off pretty well.

The easily described plot is that Jake took off with some money after a robbery 1 year before, and hi old gang wants it back.  Widmark's character Clint, wants more than just the money, he wants to punish Jake for having deserted him. The gang finds Jake and kidnaps both him and  his fiancee and demands that Jake lead them to the loot.  Jake knows they will kill him after he hands over the money, and he tries to reconcile with his fiancee, who is understandably confused and taken aback to learn of Jake's sordid past.

The movie is a kind of a bridge (albeit one of many) between the less morally ambiguous westerns of the 1940's and 50's and the anti-heroic westerns of the 60's ad 70's.

The tension builds up on the trail to the buried money, not only between Jake and his former comrades, but also between the gang members themselves, as they realize that Widmark's monomaniacal quest to get the money back is leading them all to almost certain death at the hand of hostile Indians.

A nighttime fight with the Apaches, a little help from one of the old gang who still feels some friendship toward Jake, and a final showdown between Clint and Jake make up the cimax of the movie.

Terrific location filming in the Alabama Hills at the base of California's Mount Whitney and in Death Valley add to the quality of the picture.

It'll never be considered one of the best westerns ever made, but it's a good story and an entertaining flick.",1220054400,5,2795,4.52286282306163
486921,4,6302604931,"John Sturges' name is not spoken nearly enough when the great film directors are being listed. You would think that after directing The Magnificent Seven, The Great Escape, and The Old Man and the Sea that he would be revered and recognized, but that is not the case.

Sturges was at his best making Westerns, and The Law and Jake Wade was a great one. It was the last great movie Robert Taylor made, and one of the best that Richard Widmark ever made.

Taylor plays Jake Wade, a lawman who breaks Richard Widmark out of jail. They used to ride together as outlaws, and Widmark's character saved Taylor's life, so he feels indebted to Widmark. All Widmark cares about is the stolen loot hidden from their last big heist, and he forces Taylor to take him to its location.

Tense, suspenseful, and well-acted, The Law and Jake Wade is a must-see Western.",1108080000,27,852,4.555555555555555

Jake Wade, played by Robert Taylor, is trying to go straight only to run into his former gang led by Richard Widmark.  A past incident involving hidden money leads Widmark to kidnap Wade and his fiancee. He leads them into the desert where they fight off Comanches as well as themselves.
 This is a good movie that most western fans will enjoy.  Taylor and Widmark are very good as ex-partners who reunite.  As another reviewer points out, there seems to be a real friendship between the two men. The showdown at the conclusion is very well done if a little predictable.  Nevertheless, this is a good movie that looks better in letterbox as I saw it on TCM.  Very entertaining and well worth the watch!",1050710400,11,803,4.573426573426573
486923,4,6302604931,"'The Law And Jake Wade' came out in the same year as Anthony Mann's last Western, 'Man Of The West', with which it shares many narrative, thematic and visual affinities.  Both centre on ex-outlaws who have tried to turn away from a life of crime, but who are violently dragged back by companions from the past; the struggle in both is intensified by the presence of a woman as hostage/prize.  Both feature aging Hollywood stars at or near the end of thir careers, and both climax in the heavily symbolic arena of a ghost town.  The difference in quality between both films can be seen in the contrasting stature of their stars - Gary Cooper was one of the great icons of the Western, and a potent projection of America's self-image - his face scarred with age, and body wracked with cancer added to the phantom surroundings to create a genuine, austere, end-of-the-genre atmosphere.  Robert Taylor, a matinee idol, brings no such baggage with him - void of iconic presence and resonance, 'Law' seems comparatively shallow.
The film is still terrific entertainment, particularly in its second half, with the tensions within bad guy Richard Widmark's crew threatening violence; a fierce Indian raid, with the best-ever use of arrows in a Western, seeming to swoop down from a great distance at the viewer; and the long, mythical shoot-out.  The film's characters and themes develop predictably - Taylor, who wants to rejoin civilisation by working as a lawman and marrying the daughter of a rich capitalist, must exorcise his violent, blood-stained past - and there are the usual homoerotic and Oedipal complications.  There are interesting inflections - the crew's criminal activities are seen as extensions of their 'legal' duties as soldiers during the Civil War; while Taylor is one of the genre's more dim-witted heroes, a plan dodge a pursuer by taking convoluted by-ways is foiled by the fact that he has given the pursuer his horse - all Widmark has to do is let him go and follow him!; the great ritual of (moral) rebirth is cynically set in a ghost town's cemetary.
What is most interesting about the film is its visuals.  Sturges may lack the true intellectual rigour of a Mann or Boetticher, both of whom he imitates, but there is a compositional care in 'Law' absent from his more famous blockbusters.  The widescreen patterning of characters against the landscape contributes to the film's meaning, and often works against the script; the central interior scene, as kidnappers and abductees wait for a Commanche attack, is like a very skip of civilisation.  Although the relation between individual and landscape is not telegraphed, there are three brilliant Boetticher-like shots when the camera tracking Taylor slowly descends, levelling the ground and revealing the impassively monumental mountains behind him, exposing both his lack of solidity and a natural world indifferent to his fate.  There is hardly a shot of a character that is not in some way framed by its environment; the disorienting mix of breathtaking location shots and deliberate backdrops furthers the theme.",1017187200,29,3092,5.033268101761252

Robert Taylor however it seems has fallen out of favour with movie-fans and it has become increasingly difficult finding new tittles to add to my collection since so many of his pictures has been forgotten and are no longer being produced on dvd. A great pity.
""The Law And Jake Wade"" is a western about 2 former friends and bankrobbers, whos paths cross after several years. Jake Wade - played by Taylor - is now a lawman. His former partner - played by Richard Widmark - has stayed in the racket. The 2 still has a score to settle and Wade soon finds himself forced to play along with his former partner in order to prevent his fianc getting hurt.

486957,4,6302604931,"Released in 1958, ""The Law and Jake Wade"" stars Robert Taylor as the title character who was an outlaw after the Civil War, but is now a sheriff out West. A member of his former gang, Clint Hollister (Richard Widmark), won't let him start a new life and forces Jake and his fianc (Patricia Owens) to lead him and a few other ne'er-do-wells to some buried money in a ghost town in the mountains. Unlike Jake, Clint is bad through and through and the new lawman is convinced he'll kill him after he gets the money.

This Western has a lot going for it: a solid cast, particularly Taylor as Wade and Widmark as the arrogant and no-good Clint (both are convincing Westerners); utterly breathtaking Western locations, shot in Alabama Hills , Lone Pine and Death Valley National Park, California; and some fascinating ruminations on the nature of morality, evil, law, friendship and rivalry.

As far as law goes, Clint argues that he killed and looted before and after the war, which society naturally considered evil, but he did the same thing during the war where the South viewed him as a faithful citizen. To him there's no difference, but Jake sees the difference in that the state of war may justify certain actions against enemies that aren't justified otherwise. Furthermore, Jake regrets his outlaw days whereas Clint has zero qualms about the evil that he wreaks.

Unfortunately, there are some problems on this front that are never answered. For instance, if Jake is now a ""good man"" and respects law and order (which explains the movie's title) why does he foolishly break Clint out of jail at the beginning of the movie? It's revealed that he's a man of honor who's paying back a debt, but  by doing this  he releases a serious criminal to continue to commit atrocities. He even admits that he's convinced that Clint will eventually murder him, which means he knows he's incorrigible.

Furthermore, in breaking Clint free of his death sentence a few guys get shot during the escape, although not killed. Isn't this a ridiculous risk even if Jake's being honorable by repaying a debt? It's not just a risk of innocent people potentially dying, but Jake's face was undisguised for all to see, which could potentially ruin his new life (more on this below). Everything points to nothing good coming from saving Clint from the hangman's rope but, then again, maybe Jake was holding on to the slightest possibility that Clint would see his good fortune and go straight. In other words, he was hoping for redemption for the man. In fact, it was presumably this very thing that turned Jake around.

An aspect about the plot that I liked was the friendship AND hostility of Jake and Clint's relationship. I've experienced one significant relationship like this where it's a close friendship, but with flashes of hostility rooted in the stoo-pid rivalry of the other guy, which he can't seem to deal with. Right now we're on negative terms because I dared to confront him about something he was doing that was wrong and he didn't like it. I'm about ready to call him and say (with a Western twang), ""This town's not big enough for the both of us.""

The main reason I'm not giving ""The Law and Jake Wade"" a higher rating is because of the contrived nature of certain aspects of the story and some obvious plot holes. For instance, at the beginning Jake enters the jailhouse early in the AM and the sole person guarding Clint doesn't even hear that someone entered the facility until Jake sticks a gun to his back. Why sure! Furthermore, as noted above, Jake doesn't seem to be doing a lot to disguise his identity when the town's a mere 60 miles or so from the town where he's the sheriff. Wouldn't law officers in one town be relatively known in other towns in the general region? So Jake's taking an unbelievable risk in openly breaking Clint out of jail without a disguise (a simple scarf hiding his face would've solved this issue). These types of problems in scripts  particularly old Westerns (pre-60s/70s)  insult the intelligence of viewers and loses their respect. There are numerous 50's Westerns that are guilty of these types of eye-rolling contrivances and plot holes.

Nevertheless, there's definitely enough good in ""The Law and Jake Wade"" to give it a thumbs up, especially the two strong leads, their love/hate relationship and the fascinating explorations of good and evil, law and outlawry, friendship and rivalry. Too bad the film's glaring negatives hold it back from greatness. Still, it's one of my personal favorite Westerns.

DeForest Kelley (aka Dr. McCoy) appears in a peripheral role as one of Clint's heavies.

The film runs 86 minutes.

The Richard Widmark character in this movie is precisely that kind of person.  The only thing to do about them is to shoot them, and this option is available in the fictional Old West.  And this movie has a lovely interchange:

Robert Taylor was never what you'd call a dynamic actor, he looks good but seems as if he was going through the motions for the money and the lady Patricia Owen definitely wasn't very comfortable in this movie. The story line is a bit weak, the bad guys do a good job. It really needed the Clint Eastwood touch for the final scenes to build the tension, it had great potential but just didn't quite cut it.

486994,5,6302604931,"Ordering a used movie was not the best idea in our minds, but it made the most sense when compared with other prices. However, when the DVD arived, we were delightfully pleased to find that not only was the case made to look brand new, but the advertising on Amazon about that particular DVD was correct, and it had scarcely any fingerprints at all. It was in tip-top shape!
  The movie is one of our family favorites, and we looked long and hard to finally find it again. It is Western story telling at its best, and Richard Widmark gives one of his best classic performances as the outlaw. If you're not already a Robert Taylor fan, you will be at the end of this movie! The last scene at the end, in the graveyard, marks the nature of the entire film, and the ending is happily satisfying. We are a family of 10 that watches an ""old"" movie every night for family fun, and take it from the folks who have seen them all... this one rates right up on top in the tales of the old west!",1282262400,4,984,4.201058201058201
486995,4,6302604931,"John Sturges' 1958 THE LAW AND JAKE WADE offers plenty of star power in the presences of Robert Taylor in the title role and Richard Widmark as his nemesis Clint Hollister, truly stunning Cinemascope color photography by Robert Surtees, a solid and literate screenplay by William Bowers (from a novel by Marvin H. Albert), and a wonderful supporting cast that includes Henry Silva and DeForest Kelley in typical if very nicely played henchmen roles.  Sturges puts it all together with zest and economy, punching out a compelling story of a reformed bad guy (Wade) having to deal with his past while protecting his fiancee as best he can, all in a very speedy 86 minutes.

The film opens with some lovely shots of the Alabama Hills in California, location for a great many of the most famous westerns of this period including most of the Randolph Scott/Budd Boetticher films which were made at exactly the same time.  A lone man on horseback, the usual beginning...it soon turns out to be Wade, who has come to break bandit Hollister out of jail.  But Wade and Hollister are no longer friends, and Wade leaves the man a horse but no gun in the middle of the mountains, each man more or less promising to kill the other if they come in contact again.  We don't have much more than an hour to go in this taut piece of work, so that'll be soon; shortly after we find out that Wade is actually a marshall in another town, Hollister and his gang come looking for him, and in equally short order they've kidnaped Wade and his fiancee Peggy (Patricia Owens) and are forcing them to lead the outlaws to a fortune in stolen gold.

The bulk of the film is this journey, with the five bandits trying to push Wade into leading them to the money through threats and intimidation against him and Peggy, with Hollister having to keep the younger and less disciplined members of the gang (especially Silva's psychopathic Rennie and Kelley's vengeful Wexler) in check time and again - and having to watch out for the tricky Wade's escape attempts.  Eventually the group winds up in a ghost town, but due to some less-than-intelligent gunplay they've attracted the attention of some local Comanches, and so the recovery of the gold will prove to be more complex than it should have been.  The ultimate showdown is kept until almost the last moment, by which point the odds aren't what they were at the beginning of the film.

Sturges made more than a dozen westerns, many of them fairly large-scale and prestige productions, over more than 30 years, and why this one isn't among his better-known films is a mystery to me.  I guess it lacks the obvious gloss and macho overload of THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN, and it's not based on a famous story like GUNFIGHT AT THE O.K. CORRAL or HOUR OF THE GUN; but still it strikes me as a film that should be better known.  There's a goodly amount of action (Sturges' real forte) for such a short film, and the characters are well-defined enough by the screenplay that he doesn't have to do much to keep them interesting.  Romantic complexities weren't the director's strong point, and here he's got a faithful woman who stands by her man but doesn't get in the way of the action or the real story - the history between Wade and Hollister; and Widmark and Taylor although playing pretty much to type are both excellent as the friends-turned-adversaries, and their backstory is painted in just enough detail to be believable and involving.

Really, it's hard to find any serious flaws at all in the thing; perhaps the score (there's no composer credited, so presumably it's all stock music) is a little ordinary but that's about the only ""problem"" that comes to me.  So I guess it really comes down to it not standing out enough amongs the dozens of great westerns of the period.  In any case, this strikes me as probably the best of the 8 Sturges westerns I've seen, and while not quite a masterpiece it definitely falls into the must-see category for any serious western aficionado I think.  The DVD doesn't have any extras, but it's a nice enough widescreen transfer.",1277596800,4,4083,4.6421636615811375
486996,4,6302604931,"There is a nice interplay between Widmark and Taylor throughout the movie.  Well acted and nicely told story about old outlaw buddies meeting up after one has gone straight and become a lawman while the other has gone totally bad.

Here he's pretty good, but not great as the 'snarky', nasty, bad guy that Robert Taylor breaks out of jail to start the movie. Robert Taylor left the gang he was in with Widmark and has created a new life & new identity for himself as a town Sheriff. Widmark shows up in Robert Taylor's town along with the great Henry Silva, and proceeds to kidnap Taylor & force him to retrieve money from a bank robbery they did together. The search for the money ends in a town where all the characters are then attacked by Indians. On the surface this all sounds pretty exciting but in reality the action is slow and builds to a rather unsatisfying climax. I think the problem here is Robert Taylor who is a fine actor but seems too old, and too 'nice' for the role he's playing--Gregory Peck would have nailed it.",1498089600,,968,4.266304347826087
