3595404,5,B001G3ST1W,"This had some of my favorite episodes. Discs were in excellent condition as was the case. And for your money you are getting 30 episodes. My only complaints are:

1. The Individual Cases are not labeled with the disc order. You don't know which
  discs are 1st 2nd 3rd etc.

2. There is no play all feature on the discs, you have to play the episodes  .  Individually.

3. The discs are labeled A B C, minor annoyance I know but I don't like it.",1318723200,,445,4.1647058823529415

3595417,5,B001G3ST1W,"I had the distinct honor of participating in the Mythbusters' ""Mailbag Special"" (S04E07 - ""Archimedes Burn Off""). While I had fun making my video, and ultimately wasn't chosen to go to San Francisco, my good friend, and fellow Mythbusters Fan Club member, Mike Bushroe (aka Mishabear) was chosen.

Eventually, I did get to visit with the entire cast and crew of Mythbusters, well after the Burn-Off episode aired. That was an experience I won't soon forget.",1478822400,,457,5.0131578947368425

3595438,5,B001G3ST1W,My only complaint is to Discovery for not formatting these episodes in HD. They have cropped the SD with a letter box.

3595440,5,B001G3ST1W,"Depressed about season 19 being the last one. My entire adult life has had one constant thing - the Mythbusters. I even visited M5 once. You could call me a super fan. You can learn a lot form them about life and science.  They have invaded every aspect of the American culture and I am sad to see them go. I watched there show so many times my son has to watch it every time before he goes to bed. Thanks to them my son loves science and math.  It is fun to watch them stumble through things as they learn - you learn with them, it is like a voyage of discovery.  What they have achieved with this show has expanded human knowledge for the better. This show will be sadly missed, it was not just fun to watch be you learned a lot and some of of there experiments save the life's. Before the Mythbusters the only good show to watch about science was Bill Nye the Science Guy and you didn't learn a lot from him but you sure did learn a lot from the Mythbusters. I wish that the Discovery Channel wood keep the show going for another 19 seasons. ""Thank you Jamie Adams Tory grant and kari. It was fun to watch you guys learn can achieve new things in your lives I wish you well and anything you do for the rest your lives thank you.""",1451001600,2,1232,4.082644628099174

But honestly the herbacide burned like thermite...quickly and fertilizer just needs a hot enough accelerant.  even with gloves a rancher and a farmer are wiping their hands on their pants all day.  The section on the pants even going up after being washed would imply multiple treatments and washing with herbacide.  Add nitrogen based fertilizer, and nitro sweat on the dynamite sticks.

Streaming quality is better then the original 'aired' quality, very crisp and vivid.
Amazon Prime is well worth the $79.00 per 'YEAR' price which is 'cheaper' then Netflix, Hulu-plus, etc. (about $6.59 per month).

3595540,5,B001G3ST1W,"I have seen every episode of Mythbusters they've made, and I'm not tired of the show at all. I find their approach to science and problem-solving engaging and fun. I didn't get much science in my education (professional musician) so I've learned a lot even from the silliest myths they bust.

I appreciate their good demonstrations of critical thinking and problem-solving. I think they set a fine example for young people; I'm just hoping their parents get them to pay attention!",1362182400,3,480,4.925925925925926
3595541,5,B001G3ST1W,"I love this show. I am a researcher and I must say, I have envy the Mythusters' job! Great for kids (and kids at heart) who are interested in science. Every episode just cracks me up!",1362182400,2,183,4.111111111111111

8303723,4,B001G3ST1W,"I really enjoyed the Mythbusters while it was still on TV.  I won't say I didn't miss an episode, but I tried not to.  I was very disappointed when Discovery stopped showing even reruns of Mythbusters, also, the collections didn't have all the episodes I wanted, meaning I had to grab the season box sets.

While I admit the sets are very expensive (A season for most TV series will cost you around $20 or less, so $40 is a bit much.  That's as much as you'd get for some multi-season series) I still enjoy them greatly.

One thing I should warn is that Mega Movie Myths isn't part of this box set, or in any of the other season box sets.  If you want it, it looks like you have to buy it separately.

Fortunately, picked it up a few years back.",1499990400,,745,4.1678321678321675
