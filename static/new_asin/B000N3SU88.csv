8174462,1,B000N3SU88,"It starts off ok, with a segment with Dick Clark. Not rare, but at least it has acceptable video and sound quality. The vast majority of the remaining clips don't fare so well.

There are no musical clips of the group at all, but at least this is clearly mentioned on the packaging.

Agnetha once wore a stunning green cape in a 1975 TV performance of ""Hey Hey Helen,"" but I seriously doubt that she ever dyed her air green. Well, in some of the footage seen here her hair IS green. So's everything else. Someone was asleep when transfering the footage to video, or else they couldn't be bothered with properly adjusting the chroma phase.

And you shouldn't bother to buy this DVD, unless you truely must have every ABBA release.",1337644800,,729,4.507575757575758
8174463,1,B000N3SU88,"From what started out as rare and interesting, 5 minutes in it was bad quality video trasfer, borrowing heavily from previous dvd releases and basically a waste of money. Pity.  The blurb says footage never previously available on DVD which is misleading and basically not true.

It starts out promising with a short interview during an early Dick Clark Show appearance.  After thats its downhill.

Fully half of this DVD is bits and pieces of footage from ""Super Troupers"", the remainder is mostly uninteresting footage featuring Stig Andersons daughter.

If you already have ""The Winner Takes It All"" and Super Troupers"" DVD's, you have most of whats on here.",1180656000,19,453,5.178082191780822
