8258848,2,B0015KJG2W,"I obviously made a mistake - when I rented this I assumed I would be able to follow along and do the yoga as well. But this is nothing more than a demonstration, not something you can follow along unless you know how to watch your computer and do yoga at the same time.  Where there is instruction it's mostly not in English and some sequences are just the students demonstrating without any instruction at all.  To be fair, the title of this video makes it clear it's a demonstration, but as a die hard yoga fan desperate for an authentic yoga video, I was extremely disappointed that this really was not anything more than a visual demonstration.  It is a great yoga practice and I would have definitely given this 5 stars if only I could follow along without having to look up from whatever position I'm in to see what to do next. It would have been nice if the instructor described the moves so I could actually do the yoga as well.",1336521600,,936,4.337142857142857

8258851,5,B0015KJG2W,"This DVD is great to watch. Beautiful video work, high resolution
image, great soundtrack and intense technical demonstration of
Ashtanga Yoga.  The DVD presents the Intermediate Series Demonstration
but this is not a workout for beginners or for people who are less
than totally committed to their daily yoga practise.  It is very
inspiring because it proves that with regular practise and full
dedication one is able to arrive at doing amazing things.  For anybody
interested in yoga this is some rare footage and a must have.",1206144000,4,528,5.045977011494253
