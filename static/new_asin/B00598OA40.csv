The Bridge at Remagen
The last, remaining bridge over the Rhinethe Germans want to blow it up to prevent the Allies from using it to easily cross into Germany, even though they will strand many German soldiers on the wrong side of the bridge. The Allies want to save the bridge for easy crossing into Germany. Most war movies include scenes that do not advance the plot, and even though this includes such scenes (the captured French girl in the farm house with gratuitous semi-nudity, idle soldier chatter, etc.), there are a minimum os such scenes in this film. Theres a lot of action, and a lot of five-star explosions. This is a well-done war film and well worth watching.

The Devils Brigade
A polished, professional squad of Canadians report to camp in perfect formation with bagpipes playing. An American squad reports to camp roughhousing, slovenly and undisciplined. They train together for an important mission. Most of the film takes place in camp with the factions training for their missioncompetitions, hijinks, silliness. A lot of humor through the first 3/4 of the film with the hard-core action coming during the mission in the last 1/4. An interesting viewing experience.",1505001600,,1274,4.976525821596244

8462908,5,B00598OA40,"THE BRIDGE AT REMAGEN is a fairly good World War II adventure film full of action and suspense and an interesting script. George Segal and Ben Gazzara give standout performances and share a unique camaraderie on screen that enhances the overall effectiveness of the drama. Robert Vaughn's character is tragic in nature as he is simply a German officer trying to get his job done. It also features Bradford Dillman, E.G. Marshall and Bo Hopkins. There are some truly good combat sequences and a plot, which is quite captivating. It contains a good score composed by Elmer Bernstein with a little more drive and more modernistic, which is less intellectual than his GREAT ESCAPE score. Yet, it is very effective in this film. John Guillermin neatly directed it for maximum entertainment value. I am not sure how historically accurate this film is, but it will keep you glued to your seat for shear excitement.

THE DEVIL'S BRIGADE has been around for some time now and I was lucky enough to see it in the theatre on its initial release. Through the years I came to love this film and realized it is truly one of the best war films ever made. Yet, more importantly it is just a great film given any genre. As the film unfolded I thought it was going to be another rehashing of the DIRTY DOZEN formula, but of that I was wrong. The DIRTY DOZEN is one of the all-time classic and innovative war films ever made where a band of misfits is tossed together and honed into a crack fighting unit during WWII. THE DEVIL'S BRIGADE based on some factual events, similarly takes American misfits and brings in a crack battle hardened unit of Canadian infantry and ultimately forms a ""special forces"" brigade. At the heart of both films is the training and the camaraderie that builds between these men tossed together in the extraordinary circumstances of war. Director Robert Aldrich's handling of the DIRTY DOZEN is very successful and his style of camaraderie seems rather blunt and brutal at times, but yet he built a cohesive unit to accomplish the mission. In THE DEVIL'S BRIGADE director Andrew V. McLaglen takes the John Ford approach. His scenes and direction of building and honing a cohesive and effective unit of fighting men, building that important element of camaraderie, are both bawdy and sentimental. Andrew V. McLaglen and his father had a long working association with John Ford and you see that visually on the screen in THE DEVIL'S BRIGADE. For me, this a more endearing approach. During times of war men are tossed together from many backgrounds and are called upon to serve their country and those of their allies under such uncommon circumstances from ordinary daily life testing their will and fortitude to get the job done. Andrew V. McLaglen captures that spirit in THE DEVIL'S BRIGADE.

In the film the American contingent are initially seen at odds with their Canadian counterpart. William Holden seems somewhat cold and distant as he takes up the task to mold this diverse group of men into a singular brigade that will perform with courage and valor in the field. He plays the well-disciplined Canadian unit up against the motley undisciplined ragtag group of American misfits and loners for the sole purpose of congealing and forming a cohesive spirit among the American contingent so they ultimately think as one and become one and have a common purpose to outshine the Canadians. When Holden finally lets both contingents go into town, it is there that both the Americans and Canadians finally meld into what will ultimately be the brigade as they unwittingly join forces in a brawl to end all brawls against a gang of lumberjacks at the local saloon. You know what? They just don't write scripts like this anymore. There is no cynicism here, no cinematic nonsense acknowledging the presence of some higher ideological military code of honor. These are just ordinary guys who will party hard, fight to the death and get the job done. The way they talk, walk, move and act tells us all we need to know about them.

When they finally put those red berets on and finally assemble on the parade ground as one unit, one brigade, you can't help but get a lump in your throat and a tear in your eye. There is so much more I can say about this film. Just see it for yourself. My dad served in WWII and The Korean War. We both loved this movie and watched it together so many times. I still think of images of Claude Akins and Jack Watson at odds and then the friendship they developed, Richard Jaeckel and his acrobatic feats, Andrew Prine earning his way through blood and guts and many other images too numerous to mention. I have lost focus of what I wanted to say, but I am thankful for this film in more ways than one.",1421798400,,4736,4.6830732292917165
