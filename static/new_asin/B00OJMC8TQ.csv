6752878,4,B00OJMC8TQ,"I didn't read the novel to this movie so I didn't know what to expect from it. It was a good movie to watch in the theater that it reminded me a lot of Tyler Perry's Temptation and the film Unfaithful. The film is about a Woman who cheats on her husband on not only one guy but two guys and that she could easily lose everything she has until she talks to a counselor/therapist about her story. The film teaches about what happens if you go down the road of destruction that the Woman does. This film is not for teenagers, adults only please. At the end of the film it leaves a powerful message on redemption and love that anyone can conqueror.",1420070400,6,644,4.201612903225806

6752880,3,B00OJMC8TQ,I personally saw the movie because of William Levy.  I think he is an excellent actor and when he masters the English language he will be an even better actor.  William Levy needs a lead role.  I will buy the DVD when it comes out because William Levy.,1418083200,3,252,4.208333333333333
6752881,3,B00OJMC8TQ,"I didn't read the book and thought the movie was just okay. It was like a raunchy Lifetime movie. The actors did okay with the material they were given. The movie definitely could've been better.  It was rushed and predictable.  If you really want me to be honest, I'm only buying the DVD for the sole purpose of watching and re-watching every scene that William Levy is in....I didn't know much about him before the movie and now I am a huge fan. He is a pretty good actor and he is HOT.

Oh and we get some nice views of Boris and Tyson as well. If anything, buy this for the eye candy ladies!",1416528000,16,595,4.156521739130435
6752882,4,B00OJMC8TQ,"Please read my ""Full"" review:
I work in an environment - with people afflicted by sex addiction.
A friend wanted to see this movie - and I was unaware of the topic - until At the theater.
Before I mention some flaws - this movie is Great as an overview (of a Complicated topic) of how sex addiction Can manifest itself (there are Many ways!).
I found this plot to Not be predictable (a good thing) - with some surprising (and not surprising) twists.
The overall impact is Powerful!!
Okay - here are some points - as to why I do NOT give this 5 Stars;
The Nudity and language - are COMPLETELY INAPPROPRIATE for this type of movie.
Not that sex addiction does not involve being naked - but I'm not stupid - and just seeing someone button up a shirt - or something - after the fact - is enough for me to get the idea - I do not (and my clients do NOT) need to see Graphic nudity.
All these characters are like models - gorgeous and handsome. Sex addiction is Not limited to the beautiful.
One of the biggest flaws - this film does not even touch upon the topic of LOVE ADDICTION - which is the key fuel - to an active sex addict. (Love Addiction focus - is an area of more advanced recovery)
Keep in mind - addressing this 'disease' - is much More Complicated - that even an 8 hour documentary can deliver.
This movie is Both a Great Introduction to this illness - and NOT appropriate for and Active or Recovering
'sex' addict to watch. (sad - - it has so much good to offer)",1414540800,2,1472,4.168421052631579
6752883,5,B00OJMC8TQ,"Loved this movie. Of course, not everything could be fit into the movie from the book so I was a little disappointed that some things were taken out but maybe there will be an extended version of the movie or some good deleted scenes. Definitely adding this to my favorite movies of 2014 list :)",1414195200,16,295,4.381818181818182
6752884,2,B00OJMC8TQ,"I had heard that the book this movie is based on was excellent, so I bought it and read it before the movie came out so that I could compare the two. Even though the book is not one of the greatest novels ever written, it was still pretty good and I finished reading it in two days. So needless to say, I was excited about the movie.

Well, after seeing the movie, I wish I hadn't read the book first; that way I wouldn't have been as disappointed as I was. The makers of the movie strayed very far from the novel. The novel created a good back story to the main character Zoe, and gave a deeper look into the book's antagonist, Quentin. Basically, the story is about Zoe's addiction to sex and how it has started to ruin her life. She is sleeping with three men: her husband, her client (Quentin), and another man she met at a club, Corey. Her addiction has become dangerous and it may even cost her her life.

The novel had suspense, humor, very good erotic undertones, and a good sense of character development. The movie however decided to do away with all of that and just show a lot of sex scenes. It basically just seemed like a soap opera. The movie didn't even get into the real reason why Zoe was addicted to sex, and why her and her husband had problems in the bedroom. It just left so much to be desired.

The acting was okay, but that was because they weren't really given any good material to work with. And the three lead males are great eye candy for women, but that is not enough to carry this movie to a good performance.

So if you are expecting this to be just as good as the novel, maybe you should just stay away completely unless you don't mind being highly disappointed. The makers of the movie really let down the readers. I hope someone else remakes this and actually stays true to the novel this time.",1414108800,75,1828,4.244252873563219
6752885,2,B00OJMC8TQ,"Zoe (Sharon Leal) has the perfect professional and family life...yet she feels she has a void in her life. She is a sex addict, but a classy choosey sex addict who always wears the same bra during sex. The movie is extremely formulaic and the acting and script was dry.

I am sure some people might find the subject matter interesting for one reason or another, I was bored with the cutout characters.

Parental Guide: F-bomb, sex, nudity. Good male eye candy.",1413763200,,460,4.597560975609756

6752893,4,B00OJMC8TQ,"I remembered seeing the trailer for this and thinking, ""Oooh, I wanna see that"". No, I didn't read the book, and maybe I should have to better understand the characters. With that being said, I  always enjoy a movie that deals with human emotions, relationships, and taboo subjects.

This is one of those ""If it were a man doing it....."", this behavior would be more acceptable. I think because it was a woman, who was a wife, a mother, and someone's daughter, people are more prone to judge. As for the actors and acting, no Oscar worthy performances. Definitely not a billion dollar budget movie. If you enjoy being a voyeur, this film is for you. I also recommend that couples, especially married ones, watch this movie together. Not to start arguments or become distrustful of your partner. But just to open that line of communication if something is lacking in the relationship.

I did read other reviews before purchasing this movie. Although there were a lot of negative ones, I still wanted to form my own opinion. You  know what they say about opinions.......",1501200000,2,1068,4.756756756756757

6753116,3,B00OJMC8TQ,"Have you ever been addicted to something you felt ashamed about?  Well if you're Sharon Leal's character, that addiction is sex!  Addicted had the potential to be a great movie, but as it is it's just an average one... maybe even below average.  Unfortunately the movie relies on a dramatic far-fetched take on a sexual addiction instead of a realistic one (and as you may or may not know, real sex addictions *do* exist).  The movie could have been a great opportunity to show a realistic portrayal of a sex addiction but instead t  relies on a story and atmosphere more comparable to a soap opera.

When Sharon's husband (Boris Kodjoe) refuses to satisfy the appetite-hungry woman on numerous times in a single bed sitting, she has to rely on uh, the internet and uh, toys.  Yup, no need to be specific here!  Clearly she craves sex a lot more than the average person!  A husband's dream, haha.  I kid.  Then again perhaps many people have the same high level of sex craving but know how to keep it under control.  Poor Sharon doesn't possess self-restraint.

Anyway when she finds herself at an art museum and meeting up with William Levy's character.  He comes off like a sophisticated ladies man capable of turning on tremendous charm!  She of course falls for it.  Later on the movie plays on the possibility that William might have a dangerous side when Sharon visits his place and a mysterious super attractive girl is there, but unfortunately for viewers the story never touches on that aspect until the end.  Instead we see a *very* bland and exaggerated ladies man character for the most part.  I almost want to say Sharon's husband is a more interesting character than William.

Throughout the movie Sharon tries hiding her sexual addiction, and it's almost hilarious when it appears her workmates find out she's been cheating on her husband and stare at her when she enters the building, so she feels shame about it and wears sunglasses to hide her identity.  It comes off *really* fake.  It's all in her head though- they know nothing!  Another thing that's mysterious about this movie is that Sharon's apparently been seeing yet another man, Tyson Beckford's character, but he doesn't play *nearly* as big of a role as William or Boris so his character feels tacked on.

I don't know, this movie felt like it should have been something more.  Sharon constantly lies to her kids and comes up with excuses why she couldn't attend their soccer games all because she's been seeing this other man, and her mother who lives with the family always senses Sharon's behavior is off but never questions it.  It takes until Sharon comes home late at night for the husband to wait up and question where she goes.  Sharon doesn't even give a proper answer and instead makes excuses, which should be *very* obvious to any husband that his wife is out there cheating.  Also interesting is that William is actually the one who initially hits on Sharon, not the other way around.  We can chalk this up to poor character use.

The one bright spot is the final 20 minutes.  A series of unfortunate events occur thanks to Sharon's lies and cheating finally catching up to her, and it's all rather surprising.  This is when the husband's character shines and we see his reactions.  Certainly that one violent outburst near the end was really awful writing I'm afraid.  A missed opportunity for something more intense.  But then again it was needed to lead into the next part (that I won't mention!)  Also the many visits Sharon has with her psychiatrist is pretty good writing, though the feeling is that Sharon isn't listening to a single word the lady is saying.  I guess that's an accurate portrayal of an addiction though.

So yeah, if it wasn't for the surprising stuff going on at the end I'd say this movie is a predictable exaggerated dud.  Otherwise meh, I can't say Addicted is good enough to recommend.  The acting is good enough, but the predictable story and characters is too much to take.  However I will say I LOVE the song that plays during the credits.  I found out it's called ""The Conqueror"" by Estelle.  Very uplifting message and melody, and a great music video that you simply must check out.  Very fitting to end the movie with this song.",1469491200,,4256,4.6869095816464235

Considering that point, it was entertaining.  It wasn't an Oscar winner but I am really happy that the film was available to watch.  As I thought that I had the entire story figured out half way through, I give them points for a relatively surprising ending.

I'm glad I didn't go by some of the reviews I read, because it was much better in my opinion than what others have it credit for.

There were some parts that were of course, like ""Oh, Pa Lease"" but it's a movie and entertainment so everything won't be realistic. The movie is pretty graphic. My husband looked a little uncomfortable at times. But I can see this being a reality for some people, so way to bring light to a serious lifestyle and issue for some. I gave three stars because it kept my interests but wasn't a fav for me, meaning I could wait a few years before seeing it again.

6753268,3,B00OJMC8TQ,"Entertaining!  If you've read a Zane novel, you know that the sex scenes are the most important and what keeps you turning the page.  For me, the movie was not much different.  The story line was a distant second, with some holes that were expected, but hard to ignore.  For example (not a spoiler), the fact that the main charactor didn't confide in her best friend, about her thoughts of indescretion.  Or, that the main charactor's mom didn't interject her two cents when she suspected that her daughter was acting strangely.  There are a few more, but I didn't expect a tightly executed storyline going into it.  The acting was OK; nothing to write home about, but the movie was overall entertaining.  If you like steamy sex scenes, masculine eye candy, and  a storyline that you don't have to closely follow, then this movie is for you.",1462233600,,841,4.666666666666667

6753375,4,B00OJMC8TQ,"**I'm writing this review from the opinion of someone who has not read the book.**

In defense of people who read the book and rated this rather poorly, I completely understand the point of view. Such has also been my experience if I watch a movie after reading a book.

The plot is interesting, and the cast was very good. The movie was not quite unpredictable, but there were definitely some portions that I didn't expect. This movie is definitely not for children. There is a decent amount of sexual content in certain portions of the movie, but none of it is hardcore. It also has some rough language from time to time, although that is expected in ""R"" rated movies. Despite its gritty appearance, however, there are some positive messages in my opinion:

1)  It's best to keep intimate activities, including sex, limited to people that you know and trust.

2) Baggage of individual spouses are still a part of the weight that a family will carry, and one past can be painful for both.

3) Affairs usually result from unresolved issues within a relationship. Marriages that wish to survive must find ways to push past these issues, rather through individual or collective problem-solving.

4) Love, understanding, patience, and forgiveness can get most people through nearly anything.

I recommend this movie for anyone who thinks they might be interested based upon the plot. If you're interested based upon the book, then you might want to read another review before watching.",1456617600,3,1482,4.876494023904383

6753536,3,B00OJMC8TQ,"(Posted during Blizzard of 2016, Maryland)  so, it's nothing to do but shovel, sleep and watch movies.  I saw this movie and it was ok. The attraction she had to other men wasn't really explained and the movie wasn't long enuff to go into detail. She had a medical condition and I guess some women want sex what's considered more than average. The sex scene between her & her husband seemed real. It wasn't like she saw these other men and they sparked an interest or that they were more attractive than her husband, because they were not. So addicted is a good title. She simply had an urge she needed to fulfill. I think she wanted risky or frisky sex and her husband wasn't that man. Or maybe she liked the intensity of sneaking around.  Tyson should stick to modeling.  And the main character, I liked her better in ""This Christmas"" with Chris Brown and Loretta Devine. It's cool if u want to show support for a film but it's not like, ""OMG, that was good!.""  For example, in Malcolm X when Denzel turned his index finger , the camera zoomed in and that one motion, he instructed an army of people to move, now that was ""omg!""  ...this movie, it's cool but not great.",1453507200,,1171,4.398148148148148

This is because film studios throw so much trash at viewing audiences, it's hard to determine which ones are worth watching. Further, Amazon's viewer rating system is not much help, either, in culling  the good from the bad.

6754268,2,B00OJMC8TQ,"As the USA moves ever-closer to being a rerun of Victorian England it necessarily spawns genre movies appropriate to the period. We're accustomed to the ""muscular moral hero"" shtick from countless action movies and now we get the ""sex is bad"" version seven which tells us that not only are there consequences if one has an affair while married but also that such behavior is, of course, an ""addiction."" Hollywood, ever the purveyor of tired old clichs designed to keep Middle America firmly under control while titillating it with brief glimpses of ersatz passion, has in recent years pioneered the new genre of sex-as-addiction.

In other words, we're still firmly in the emotional space normally occupied by five-year-olds. In this movie not only is the script lame and the acting hilariously wooden but we have the ""message"" that anyone who has a larger than normal sexual appetite is necessarily therefore an addict. Forget evolutionary psychology, forget the many studies that show we're a partially monogamous species, forget the fact that in most couples one or both partners feel the need for something else and this is perfectly normal. Replace all that with ""extra-marital sex is desirable and bad."" Very Old Testament stuff indeed, and about as interesting. While Hollywood has always excelled at hypocrisy and superficiality, this genre of ""the sex addict"" takes it to a new low. Presumably this stuff appeals to TV evangelists who preach ""morality"" while screwing everyone around them; likewise presumably it is supported by Republican politicians who preach white-bread values while indulging in every vice from substance abuse to fornicating with interns. Such nonsense as this movie enables hypocrites to pretend to ""virtue"" while in reality being less continent than the average tom cat. But why anyone else would waste time watching such trash is unclear to me, unless like me they were doing it because a friend asked them to watch it with them. And even then we agreed to bail out around halfway through as it was clear there was nothing but abject rubbish being peddled.

In short there is nothing to recommend about this awful little movie. It's hilariously bad. The actors are all from the body-builder's book of studio extras (really, what artist do you know who spends 4 hours per day in the gym chiseling his muscles?) and the unreality is appropriate. This is an entirely superficial and empty movie with nothing to say but that says it tediously.",1442016000,,2474,5.0464547677261615

This movie is kind of a combo between a lifetime movie and soft core porn. But at the end of the day if you are just looking for some entertainment on a lazy Sunday afternoon this movie will do the trick. It has an interesting spin on the sex addict topic by making the woman the one with the problem, but at times the dialog and story is not even in the realm of reality.

From the very good looking actors who portrayed the parts, to the homes in which everyone lives, to profession that each protagonist has, and the business he or she owns, this movie is all about what Hollywood thinks sexual addiction should look like. Including the happy ending in which all was forgiven. It was all too pretty and too easy. At least the showed the protagonist losing something important to her, her business and what a business it was.  We have the woman who markets art to businesses for (licenses artwork for royalties, etc. on behalf of the artist for a fee), the architect husband, the crazy talented fantastically successful artist who first ""leads her astray,""  and the second lover, who leads her farther down the forbidden path.

6754484,5,B00OJMC8TQ,I had heard about this movie coming out some time ago. I've been a fan of Sharon Leal and Boris Kudjo for quite awhile. The casting was excellent! The chemistry between Sharon and Jason was magnetic and truly believable. Very erotic while still intriguing on the reminder that sex is an addiction and real for many people.

Visually it was very appealing which is a detail I would expect from a music video director, but the story was weak. I hated the fact that the character was given a pass and given a reason for us to feel sympathetic for her behaviour. If it was a man doing what she did we would be saying the sex addiction story is a cop out. The plot was just very unrealistic and I wish I can say the novel was was better but over all both leave you feeling like you're the one that got cheated on.

The main character has a sex addiction which is ruining her life. This would be very interesting if the characters had emotional depth, and if they delved into the addiction. However, the way the movie is written, it just seems like the main character is a dissatisfied wife who gets turned out by her hot client.

I actually fell asleep watching the film. The parts that I didn't fall asleep on either made me groan or laugh because some of the action and dialogue were so cliche that it was painful. Because of this, I would recommend the book over the movie. If you're needing an erotic movie to watch then watch Unfaithful.",1438732800,,883,4.547169811320755

6754509,2,B00OJMC8TQ,"Contains spoilers.

Zoe is a woman who has all of these things :

(1) She has an interesting job that she enjoys, running her own business, and keeping her own hours.  The business is named after her - - Zoe & Co. - - so, she is successful and respected.

(2) She has a friend who runs the business with her, who cares about keeping the business going because she works extra long hours which leaves Zoe free to run around, and this friend was still there for her after the business closed. she is lucky to have a friend who obviously still cared for her after knowing everything that she did regarding their business and her marriage.  I wondered why Zoe never confided in her friend, who obviously would have tried to help her.

(3) She has two well-behaved adorable children who obviously love her because they keep trying to get her to spend time with them and they keep trying to get her attention.

(4) She is beautiful and healthy, despite running around at all hours and putting herself in dangerous situations. at least she was using condoms, but only some of the time, because in the scene where Zoe and Corey had sex for the first time in the public bathroom, clearly it was too quick and urgent to grab a condom.

(5) She has a big, beautiful house that anyone would be proud of.

(6) She has a mother who obviously loves her, who lives with her, who takes care of the children without complaints whenever Zoe just runs out, and who does not interfere in her marriage and minds her own business and does not judge Zoe, and who continued to be there for Zoe after she discovered the sexual behaviors.anyone who has had a difficult mother or mother-in-law would appreciate this lady.

(7) She does not have the problems or worries that most people have, such as struggling financially or struggling regarding her children, and it was obvious that her mother did everything, such as cleaning the house, doing laundry, cooking, food-shopping, caring for the children, etc etc.

(8) She has a nice car, and her husband obviously has his own car, which gives her the freedom to run around at all hours and she has beautiful clothes and jewelry her diamond wedding ring was gorgeous.  In other words, she has all of the little luxuries that every woman wants.

(9) Most of all, she has a husband who obviously loves her he is handsome  he is faithful he tells her constantly that he loves her, and so he  is always showing her that he appreciates her... he is an architect, working hard and providing for her and the family he is a good father, spending time with the children he gets along with her mother, who lives with them, when most men cannot stand their mother-in-law he is not possessive, he trusts her, he lets her have all kinds of freedoms and never questions her she admitted that they had sex two to three times a day, every day, and she clearly was enjoying it, and it was also obvious that this man was easy to talk to, so if she wanted to ""spice up"" their already active sex life, it appeared that all that she needed to do was to discuss it with him even when they argued, it was clear that he was reasonable and wanted to try to make her happy and at the end, after discovering that she was cheating on him with several men, he did not hit her or try to hurt her, he did not try to take the children away or take the house or even ask for a divorce, and he still took care of her and actually forgave her and gave their marriage another try... What woman could not be happy with this man?  This man is unbelievable.

So, why would this woman risk absolutely everything, including her health, her safety, her job, her marriage, her children, and the respect of everyone?

Why couldn't Zoe be happy with everything in her life?
What more could any woman want?

It is wonderful that she was in therapy, but she needed to get into couples therapy, as her therapist suggested.

It bothered me that Zoe never talked about guilt in her therapy sessions.

She never talked about feeling guilty about cheating on her wonderful husband, or losing her own self-respect, or neglecting her children.

She never worried about the dangers that she was putting herself in, going out alone at night with strangers.

At the end, the husband just forgave her and she did not have to work to earn that forgiveness or to regain any trust from him.

Her mother and friend did not judge her, and no one was angry at her or turned away from her.

She did not lose anything at all, except for her business.

She obviously was also watching porn and was free to masturbate anytime that she wanted, so she could have satisfied her sex addiction through that. She did not have to cheat, and certainly not with several men.  She is lucky that she did not get HIV and give it to her husband also.

She showed up at her therapy sessions, but even then, she always got up and left before the therapist ever said that the time was up, in other words, I did not see Zoe trying the way that she could have tried if she really wanted to deal with her addiction.

I did not appreciate the happy ending of this movie.
Zoe deserved to lose everything.
So, she finally stops having sex, completely, and goes to sex addiction meetings.
We all know that an addict is always an addict.
So, how long would it be before Zoe started having dangerous sex again?",1437177600,2,5338,4.418367346938775

6754523,5,B00OJMC8TQ,"Zane is a writer who has produced and written a series of shows for late night cable that are steamy and erotic that can be liked by everyone no matter what your preferences are. Think the Red Shoe Diaries with a mostly African American cast and a lot of sex.... The men are all hot and sexy and the women are sultry and inviting it was series that I watched throughout the years in all of its various incarnations.  When this movie came out and I saw that Zane's name was attached to it I knew it would be good and the trailer alone fogged up my computer screen.  Boris Kodjoe is one of the hottest names in movie and tv and he def steams things up when he is on screen not to mention model Tyson Beckford, Sharon Leal and wait til you see William Levy omg where did they find him...he steals every scene he is in.

A housewife and working mom has it all handsome husband, big house, two perfect kids and her own successful business not too mention a very powerful sex addiction. Think of this as every movie you have seen Michael Douglas in where he is addicted to strong sexy powerful women and can't say no but ad a black woman and make her as equally as addicted and your all set.  The main character has a great sex life and a great marriage but as the movie goes on she finds it is simply not enough as she can't get enough.  She finds a challenge in a new client who seduces her over and over again first only for sex but he finds himself consumed by her and she him. While late work nights keep her husband busy she finds herself wanting to be with the client more and more.  While she goes back and forth on what is right and what is wrong she eventually catches the eye of club hopping and girl stopping ladies man Tyson who instantly also becomes smitten with her.

As the movie goes on she finds herself trying to juggle between keeping her secret life together, holding her business above water and finding a way to keep her family intact.  This movie has it all, hot sex scenes, drama lies and deceptions all in under 2 hours.  It's a hotter Lifetime movie with better bodies, a better script and a decent ending.  Def a hot movie to pass the time with.",1434240000,6,2168,4.214975845410628

He's a loving husband who from what I saw, was a good provider, he was a great father, he was satisfying her in the bedroom, (she was moaning like crazy and clinging onto him for dear life when they were making love so I assume she was liking it), and he was faithful to her.  So what exactly were her complaints about him?  If she wanted to spice things up in the bedroom, why didn't she open her mouth and say something to him instead of running off to find another man to sleep with?

Plus at the end of the movie when she finally gets out of the hospital, why did HE have to leave at the end of the movie?  Why didn't he kick HER out?  I mean she was the one who was unfaithful and broke her wedding vows and slept with other men.  And why did SHE get to keep the kids?  Seems like he was a better parent that she was.  He actually took care of them and provided for them.

I hate when Hollywood takes books and just re-writes things anyway they want because someone at the top of the food chain wants to change things for no other reason than that's just what they personally want.  Plus I hated the wife character and I had no sympathy for her at all.

If you liked the book, don't watch the movie.",1431302400,,1466,4.170818505338079

Love conquers everything, it gives us the strength that is needed to continue on. Only love will accept all of you, as you are with flaws and virtues. We all, at some point in our lives need to confront our fears and this might be very hard and painful. But if love is there with us after the fall, providing inner strength and support then there is hope, then all is possible. This world is in great need of hope and true love.

It's hard for me to decipher just how good this movie exactly is, since the genre itself is inherently crappy. But I also can't recommend this film to anyone, so perhaps there's my answer. It's somewhat sexy, mostly over-dramatic, with bad acting and unbelievable plot lines. The addiction topic is an interesting one, but this isn't going to be the next groundbreaking new expose. Addicted is what it is; you probably already know whether or not you enjoy that genre. The video quality of the DVD was high, the audio was fine, and there are a few extras if you're looking for more.

One I looked at it as a reader of the book and I was disappointed due to the fact of the things that were taken out... like Zoe having a relationship with woman living downstairs also.... or her pleasing herself with the small statue on her desk... things that would've really put her addiction out there... the movie just shows her having a relationship with two men at the same time... IDK

The other way I looked at it was in the eyes of someone that's going through the same problems she was going through. I suffer from sex addiction also and it doesn't matter what you do u don't wanna destroy ur family nor the people u love but when u have a problem family life is boring to u and u need that excitement. So I guess I was also looking for answers into why also... but I think I viewed the movie more as a reader... so one star is all I can give it...  maybe different characters would've made it better.... not sure...",1426291200,,1011,4.206185567010309

Clearly,there were issues never addressed,she hid it,and it came back full blown in her married life. I understand people do not like the idea of a woman cheating, yet men are praised, unlikely to be judged for sleeping around.

6754718,2,B00OJMC8TQ,"This movie is played by excellent actors but the screenplay is not good at all. The female character is not convincing and looks like more a Broadway show than a movie. The only one who plays his character well is the husband.
Cast:
Sharon Leal (Zoe) : Remember me the female fatale but in a Broadway version. The wardrobe is horrible and the shoes don't fit her well liked a half extra size. Watching her walking give me a headache and it looks like she is going to fall. The acting and role played don't convince me and she looks better in a fashion magazine as a model but with a good fashion designer.
William Levy: The guy is a sex symbol in the Hispanic community but he need to take speech classes in English as second language. The acting is not bad at all but just don't fit well in this story like a lost puzzle piece.
The husband played by Boris is the best character played here. Excellent and convincing.

The movie also alludes to her being solely responsible for her damaging and risky behavior. For those who have read the book, you know that that was anything but the case.

6754794,3,B00OJMC8TQ,"Take the movie ""Unfaithful"" and strip away its soul; ""Addicted"" is born.  From an emotional standpoint, I felt nothing while watching this numbingly boring film.  No intrigue, no compassion, no hope, no sorrow.  However, when one of the three sex gods appeared on my screen I assure you, I felt EVerything but bored and I think the producers are flippin' GENIUSES.  They had a totally lame been-done plot with a cheesy predictable outcome so they sat around smoking cigars asking, ""how the bleep will we get anyone to PAY to see this soft core pity porn?""

6754796,5,B00OJMC8TQ,"Some black women usually think of black men as unsuccessful, unsupportive, etc, this movie shows that the ideal black women in a relationship with an equally ideal black man will still have problems, as, a black women, even with a modest, caring, career oriented black man come to heaps by being unsatisfied and ungrateful despite a successful lifestyle, it also breaks the typical stereotypes about black men.",1423440000,2,410,5.134328358208955
6754797,1,B00OJMC8TQ,"Spoilers. This story was an age-old tale about a bored house wife cheating on her passionless husband with a sexy guy with a foreign accent. In fact, it's so age-old, that it is almost exactly like Unfaithful movie except with some added (might I add, terrible) twists. Instead of going the traditional route of deceit, murder, cover-up. This story turned into a terrible, directionless script about sex addiction with a psychological thriller and a laugh at the end. If the plot was focused on ""addiction"", it would have made it so much better, but instead I saw no real in-depth struggle of sex addiction and instead just a story about a cheating wife, that happened to discover she was addicted to sex. The tone of the entire movie was like a psychotic breakdown - a potpourri of passion, sadness, mystery murder, followed by... humor???!!! There's a scene where Tony (the passionate painter) gets up from getting hit on the head and just walks away and says some really nonchalant, 3rd-person line like they would do in Scary Movie. It's like the director went, ""and we're gonna cut into the entire tone of this film, and add humor to end the scene."" I would tell you what the line was, but that would be like digging through my memory bank to find a peso i can't convert into a penny.  I don't know if the script was crap, or the director was crap, or (maybe the whole movie was shot really well) the editor messed it all up. But the only saving grace to the film is some good acting by Sharon Leal and Brandon Gonzales. If you literally have nothing to do all day, and you wanted to watch a movie, I still wouldn't watch this movie.",1423440000,,1638,4.515151515151516
6754798,1,B00OJMC8TQ,"I didn't read the book, but this film was terrible. Horrible script, bad chemistry, what appeared as poor acting (although that could just be the awful material they were given), and plot holes galore.

6754799,2,B00OJMC8TQ,"The best part of the film is William Levy. He's a strong actor, with excellent emotional range. even though he hasn't done as many films as some of the other actors, he's truly the standout. The story really is not cohesive. Its about a woman with a sex addiction but initially it's directed in a way that makes it seem like she is falling for William Levy's character during their affair. The tension that is built from these scenes feels like more than just casual sex so when things go badly you feel as if the relationship they had is thrown to the side and it doesn't make sense. Some of the acting from Boris Kojo and Tyson Beckford is pretty awful and hard to watch. The ending is very cliche and is reminiscent of a Tyler Perry typical story line. Bottom line is the entertaining elements of the film do not lie in the story but more in the esthetics of the male actors.",1423180800,5,878,4.327272727272727

8683899,1,B00OJMC8TQ,"This movie is absolute trash. The screenplay is trite and uninspired. The characters are shallow and underdeveloped. The acting  is inadequate, but that could be attributed to the awful screenplay. It is impossible to suspend disbelief to accept the plot of the movie on its face. The erotic scenes are anything but. The hurried attempt to explain the psychological reasons for the protagonist's ""affliction"" at the end of the movie is insulting to the movie and frankly trivializes the gravity of that kind of trauma. It also makes no attempt to explain the relationship between the trauma and the subsequent ""affliction."" The movie is based on an ""erotic"" novel by the author Zane. The quality of the author's writing is debatable (at best); therefore I shouldn't be surprised that an inferior novel produced an inferior film adaptation.",1521158400,,839,5.124087591240876
