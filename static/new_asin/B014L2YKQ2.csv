7414207,1,B014L2YKQ2,"Another classic stephen king film comes to Blu-ray courtesy of Olive films
who are known for not giving any respect to old classics
meaning average HD transfers which look like dvd transfer, the sound quality is typical Mono sound
 and no new extras at all
just plain barebones treatment, what else is new with Olive films Disgusting effort

the dvd release by MGM only had the trailer but has a excellent widescreen transfer
at least MGM made an effort to clean up the picture quality with a new 2:35:1 widescreen transfer
Olive films have given the film no respect
and this film deserves more respect no Doubt about it
Olive films should've made some effort with getting new extras
eg a new interview with Director Tom McLoughlin, or new interview with Tim matheson & Brooke Adams
or a new Directors commentary at least
but obviously not Olive films didn't bother which does not surprise me
if you check out Olive films other blu-ray releases they're all given the same barebones treatment
amazon have this blu-ray for $13, big ripoff i think it's worth less than $10 for sure
my MGM DVD has better quality transfer i think and it's Digital remaster with 5.1 dolby surround mix
this blu-ray is worth nothing, i'll be keeping my MGM DVD version
4 stars for the film, 1 star for this new blu-ray version which is insulting.",1446336000,2,1323,4.67381974248927

7414211,3,B014L2YKQ2,"Sometimes They Come Back
is a decent made for tv movie
Directed by Tom McLoughlin  (known for Friday the 13th Part VI: Jason Lives, &  Date with an Angel)

Is it the worst King film adaption not really it's not the best either it's somewhere in the middle
It's a few steps below ""IT""
but, it has a 5 star cast and high production values for a tv movie

Great Cast:
Tim Matheson  as  Jim Norman (Tim is enjoyable in everything he does this role is no exception)
 Brooke Adams  as  Sally Norman  (great iconic type actress  she turned down offer to be one of the original Charlie's Angels,  has done so much always been a big fan!)  she is also married to  Tony Shalhoub  (MONK)
Robert Rusler  as  Richard Lawson  (In the 1980's he was in some massive films Weird Science,  A Nightmare on Elm Street 2: Freddy's Revenge,  Vamp )
 William Sanderson  as Carl Mueller (age 44)  (another iconic actor from the 1980's you'd know his face)

the tv movie was adapted from a short story by King
It's probably one of the shortest King tv movies  besides Riding the Bullet & Quicksilver Highway  (it runs  97 min)

A school teacher return's to the small town he grew up in
the school teacher (Tim Matheson) starts seeing ghost of these high school Greasers that killed his brother
each greaser is coming back to haunt him in a sense
It's a tension filled ghost story
it's very story driven don't expect over the top gore and violence
If you never seen it catch it on Cable or a streaming service or buy the dvd (used) don't buy the BR without ever seeing the film
first..... It's one of those films that you either love it for what it is or despise it for using King's name just to make a film adaption

It has it's moments the film must have been good enough it got a follow up Sometimes They Come Back... Again (The Sequel is actual better in terms of pacing it was a direct to VHS Sequel  rated R
and a third Sometimes They Come Back... for More  (which I have no clue) the third I'm sure is terrible and just a money grab put out to hold onto the licensing rights of the name
The $19.99 price tag is a bit high if it has a audio commentary i'll without a doubt jump on it but, if it's a bare bones edition I'll pass until it's around $12.00  7.5/10",1443052800,,2240,4.222222222222222
7414252,4,B014L2YKQ2,"I watched this movie again after a couple of years and although its still a classic, I noticed a few inconsistencies with the plot. For example, the supposed storyline is that Lawsons gang needs to take a life in order for another of them to come back. But in a few instances the replacement for the life they are going to take comes back early like when Lawson runs down Billy you can see several of his gang members in the car even though technically they wouldnt be eligible to return yet according to the storyline. And in a few instances the replacement actually kills the person they are going to replace even though that person has not been killed yet to enable their return.",1509494400,,682,4.464

7414310,3,B014L2YKQ2,"Jim Norman (Tim Matheson) has moved back to his hometown with his wife and kid, where many years earlier something happened between him and his brother vs 4 teen hoodlums. Big tragedy and needless to say....sometimes they come back. Spirits I mean. The hoods return to torment now teaching Jim. We get occasional flashbacks as to what happened. The performers are okay, nothing to write home about and it is the usual ""no one believes me thing...am I going crazy?"" it is an okay watching experience so if you are in the mood for some old time spookery go for it. Made in 1991.",1447977600,2,576,4.548076923076923
7414311,4,B014L2YKQ2,"There are no noteworthy extras n this blu ray release, but I've always enjoyed this movie and felt like it was sort of unfairly relegated to the C-list of Stephen King adaptations... the ending has always annoyed me, since it's a marked departure from the original short story's grim conclusion and a cheap ""warm & fuzzy"" cop-out  departure at that... but some cool performances by Robert Rusler and his murderous gang of undead, 50s greaser-punk ghosts make it worthwhile, and the picture & sound quality are decent, and this is most likely the best release this film will ever get.",1447027200,,583,4.83
