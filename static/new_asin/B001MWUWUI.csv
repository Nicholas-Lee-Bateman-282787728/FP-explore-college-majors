3702508,5,B001MWUWUI,"This DVD brings back a lot of  childhood memories. It's fun, fun, fun!
The earlier cartoons, when Woody was really goofy looking and his HEA, HEA, HEA, HEAA,HEA was done by Walter Lanz's wife are my favorite.

I highly recommend this DVD to kids of all ages and to the young at heart.",1238457600,11,284,4.339622641509434
3702509,5,B001MWUWUI,"If you want a sample of Woody Woodpecker cartoons and/or think the Classic Cartoon Collection may be too much, then this is just right.

This DVD contains fifteen cartoons spanning 1940 through 1951 featuring Woody goofing around with such characters as Wally Walrus, Andy Panda, Buzz Buzzard, the nameless wolf and a ghost named Starvation. There are also five additional cartoons produced by Walter Lantz but not starring Woody. These were released in the late '40s through the early '50s. And finally as a bonus, there are two episodes of The Woody Woodpecker Show that aired in 1970. Each one features four cartoons that were released in the late '50's and early '60s. Here, you'll see characters like Chilly Willy, Smedley the Dog, All I. Gator and Inspector Willoughby.

This is definitely worth the purchase price. Watching these cartoons brought back a lot of childhood memories. When you watch them again, you'll realize how great these cartoons were, and still are.",1237161600,38,975,5.049689440993789

3702526,4,B001MWUWUI,"WOODY WOODPECKER-FAVORITES: One of Cartoon Land's funniest, most aggressive antagonists (right up there with BUGS BUNNY and DAFFY DUCK), WALTER LANTZ's WOODY WOODPECKER was a red headed rebel rouser with the most famous laugh in animated history. Swedish fall guy WALLY WALRUS, would be swindler BUZZ BUZZARD and any number of hapless victims proved no match for WOODY's lightning-paced antics, insatiable appetite for trouble, and noggin' knockin' rat-a-tat-tat beak attack. The early theatrical high water marks (one featuring the 1948 hit single WOODY WOODPECKER SONG) were highly preferable to later watered down TV toons in which LANTZ was forced to tone down the violence and mayhem. Warmth-seeking penguin CHILLY WILLY and amiable ANDY PANDA rounded out LANTZ' stable of stars (the creator also appeared in informative mini-documentaries about the basics of animation), but WOODY established the pecking order from day one.

This particular Woody Woodpecker has a totally different demeanor about him.  It seemed a bit darker in plot, and even his facial expression just seemed a bit off...evil and mean, if you will...compared to the one shown on the picture here.  We didn't even get past the first two episodes before I turned it off, never to be seen again.",1421193600,3,518,4.375
