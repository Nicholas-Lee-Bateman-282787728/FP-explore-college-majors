Production values are great, effects are very good, and the plot is well written.  I rank it up there with The Walking Dead on AMC.",1320710400,3,257,4.019607843137255
4592555,1,B0056OZHYE,"I watched this movie, and I'm even ashamed to say it. This is probably the worst movie made, and is so bad that it will become a classic bad movie. Bad directing, bad acting, bad special effects, bad dialogue and a terrible script all combine to form a classic debacle. It's so bad, that most movie critics shouldn't even pan this movie, since it gets a unique niche in bad movies.",1319846400,6,381,4.380281690140845
4592556,1,B0056OZHYE,"Needless to say, the cover of the DVD does not represent the movie in any manner, shape, or form, which makes it deceit by any name.

Yes, this is another of those tedious handheld camera flicks that defy rationale (even for a zombie movie).  Exactly where did this cameraman get a never ending power supply to keep filming day and night?  And how did he keep from tripping in a forest at a dead run and in the dark!?  And why was he filming carnage instead of helping the few survivors fight off the zombies!?
The opening ""found footage"" is likewise unreasonable.  Who goes out in the night to investigate a ""noise"" with a handheld camera glued to their face instead of using a flashlight!?

This was a disjointed mess made worse by bad acting and terrible dialog and not one but two rapes!
But as far as the story goes, the most shameful act of stupidity was when the cameraman and his gang are captured by thugs.....who then take up his camera and continue filming!  Yeah, that's a natural impulse.

Besides taxing all logic and reason, this was just a poorly made film on every level.",1319760000,24,1088,4.4873096446700504
4592557,4,B0056OZHYE,"I saw the first one and thought it was half hearted, but this offers a little more in the way of horror, including some neat ideas. Best moments include survivors wearing night vision goggles, as they step quietly around zombies in a cemetery. Very tense. Also liked the idea of human bandits being as scary and deadly as the zombies. There were plenty of weak spots, but overall an enjoyable rental.",1318809600,6,400,4.647887323943662
4592558,3,B0056OZHYE,"I love zombie movies. I hate that annoying hand held herky-jerky motion, especially with night vision discoloration. This film has that stuff, including the opening with a ""REC"" up in the corner, which was held steadier than the main part of the film. This is the fourth month of the zombie (referred to as ""those things"" in the film). It is a viral disease and not actually people rising from the dead walking while dragging a leg, just slow moving infected people who eat other people...but not each other. There are pockets of survivors held up in military camps. This one particular camp is attacked by zombies. They escape (along with the guy with the camera) and a woman reporter who is slightly crazy, but not a zombie.

HEY! Put the camera down and shoot something with a gun! This movie takes place in England.

Their plan is to travel through the forest to minimize zombie contact, head for the town of Hope, on the east coast and team up with another group of supposed survivors. From there, head to Holland where there exists a large colony of uninfected people. The military is disliked by the civilians because of their role in the outbreak cleansing. They encounter zombies and other group of civilian survivors on their quest. 4 1/2 star zombie film if you loved the hand held stuff of Quarantine, otherwise it is just a 3 star zombie film as I found the camera motion annoying.

F-bomb, nudity, rape, and irony at the end.",1318636800,13,1439,4.635294117647059
4592559,5,B0056OZHYE,"Okay being a HUGE fan of anything zombie I have seen and own almost every zombie film available in America, Germany, Italy, Japan, etc.  My multi-region player allows me watch whatever I want from anywhere in the world.  That being said I have seen many VERY BAD zombie films and there are many more very bad ones than very good ones.  However this franchise is not bad at all and if you've watched either the first one or this one and your opinion is that it's crap, terribly acted, or terribly shot and directed then you haven't seen very many low budget zombie flicks in your life period.  Yes it's shot POV/SOV style with lots of night vision scenes and dark rooms with flashlights (for me making it more realistic and scary) but this is NOT a terriblly written or directed or acted movie if you think so you haven't seen terrible.  Is it George Romero or Lucio Fulci oh hell no but it is by no means bad, go rent Zombies! Zombies! Zombies!  House of the Dead, RetarDEAD, Necrotrpolis Awakened, Necro Files, etc.  if you want to see an unwatchable zombie film.  Zombie Diaries is scary as hell to use the cliche phrase and is more real to me than even Romero and Fulci's films mostly because of the present date and also because when I watch POV films and SOV films I feel as though I'm behind the camera.  Something film cannot touch, well Romero did it with Diary of the Dead but most POV's are shot on video and i love Diary of the Dead but Zombie Diaries is far scarier period.  So get off your undeadhorse and if you say this movie is full of bad acting and etc. go spew your bandwagon opinions to the masses who shouldn't be watching these kinds of movies anyway...I call you guys Blair Witchers since that's the movie that began this trend of POV/SOV films and movies.  Yes Cannibal Holocaust was like this or even The Legend of Boggy Creek but neither was paralleled to the kinds of shooting done in these types of documentary style gems.",1318464000,9,1950,4.418994413407821

I love zombie movies so I can watch most all of them seeing the good in each one. This one was fair but nothing great could have been so much better. Most of the movie takes place in the dark with no lighting or shot with a green light didn't look anything like night vision that I thought just sucked.

Overall this movie is a low budget one and just be looked and viewed as such. It is what it is low budget however I thought the zombies were fair and I was able to watch it from start to end and bought it for my zombie movie collection..",1398470400,2,652,4.133858267716535

4592566,2,B0056OZHYE,"The Zombie Diaries 2 (Michael Bartlett and Kevin Gates, 2011)

Despite everything I know about sequels often being worse than the originals (and sometimes sequels not having a damn thing to do with the originals in the first place--the Zombie ""series"" of Italian films, for example, don't have a blessed thing to do with one another, starting with a studio christening Lucio Fulci's classic Zombi 2 as a sequel to Romero's Dawn of the Dead, which is just ridiculous), even the idea that The Zombie Diaries 2 implies that The Zombie Diaries exists makes me want to try and avoid ever seeing mention of it. Yet another shakycam attempt at a zombie movie that is utterly devoid of thrills or chills.

We get three somewhat related episodes that focus on the survivors of a military base that's overrun in the first episode (this particular piece of stupidity has been savaged, quite rightly, by any number of users on the IMDB for the mechanism that allows this to happen). The second has our pals--photographer Jones (The Devil's Hand's Rob Oldfield), Maddox (Dawn of the Dragonslayer's Philip Brodie), Kayne (World War Z's Vicky Araico), Jez (Toby Bowman, whose career to date has been the Zombie Diaries franchise, and looking him up at IMDB unfortunately clued me in to the first movie's existence), and Leeann (Elemental Storage's Alix Wilton Regan)--facing off against a band of marauders who are only slightly less stupid than the biker gang in Dawn of the Dead, while the third has them trying to stay alive whilst waiting for boats they found out were on their way to England from an intercepted radio transmission. Nothing new, from the camera angles to the ""twist"" ending you likely saw coming a mile away. Some decent acting from a few of the principals is about the only thing the movie has going for it. That may be enough for you; it wasn't for me. * ",1376438400,,1863,4.761609907120743

4592572,3,B0056OZHYE,"Three months after the worldwide zombie outbreak that wiped 99.9% of the population, a small group of British survivors are trying to survive. They have heard that there is a ship at sea that is taking the remaining survivors to safety. The group is lead by Maddox (played by Philip Brodie) whom has just taken in a few more survivors at the beachside compound, which includes the sole survivor of the first movie's film crew, Leanne, (played by Alix Wilton Regan who is replacing Victoria Summer). Before long the zombies invade the compound causing Maddox, Leanne, Jonesy, who is constantly filming with his camera, and a few others to runaway.

With no vehicles, they run on foot looking for any place for shelter. Eventually they come across some booby-traps and the remains of headless zombies in a wooded area. The carefully survey a cabin from a distance where a group of human bandits are watching another man sexually assault a female zombie. The deadly Goke (played by Russell Jones) comes out of the cabin and murders the man. That is when Leanne recognizes Goke and his henchman Manny as she had encountered them in the first movie.

Instead of using their weapons, Maddox and the group battle the undead by hand-to-hand combat, so the bandits won't know their location, but it is too late as Goke learns that Leanne is alive and he has a special fate for her.

I never even knew there was a movie called Zombie Diaries or that it had a sequel! I just happened to stumble across it at my local Walmart last week for only five dollars, so I thought I would give it a try as it had cool DVD cover. Well, let's just say that covers can sometimes be misleading, like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hellraiser-Revelations/dp/B0056P6SOG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hellraiser: Revelations</a>. Zombies Diaries 2, or also known as World of the Dead: Zombie Diaries, is a low-budget British horror film about a group of survivors trying to reach the shore to get to a ship that will rescue them.

It has similar plot, except for the fact that Zombie Diaries 2 doesn't use CGI special effects and it contains more graphic situations, including a rape scene, which I could have done without. Considering its budget, the movie was nicely filmed, but I got annoyed with all the shaky camera shots. It basically follows the same zombie rules set by George A. Romero in the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Night-of-the-Living-Dead/dp/B00005B1YC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Night of the Living Dead</a>. Overall, Zombie Diaries 2 is better than your typical low-budget zombie flick, but it doesn't offer anything new, especially with the predictable ending.",1350432000,5,2925,5.583333333333333
4592573,4,B0056OZHYE,"Set some three to four months after the outbreak that turned the World into a zombieland, we follow a surviving band of soldiers and civilians that have taken refuge at a rural military barracks. Even though things look bleak for our group, hope comes in the form of a high level communication that tells of sanctuary elsewhere in Europe. That's what Zombie Diaries 2 is about.

I've got to say, Zombie Diaries 2 is considerably better than the original. Regardless of what people say about this series, it's not THAT bad. However, I still loathe how it's filmed and the acting isn't much better...but that's the beauty of this film and this is a low-budget movie, after all, so I'm not going to be that hard on it. If I did have any major gripes about the movie, it would be the rape scenes. I didn't really see the point in them.",1345680000,3,831,4.467105263157895
4592574,3,B0056OZHYE,"People have complained about the Found Footage format used in this film and I want to send a moment to point out why they seem to have no clue what they're talking about. Found Footage films have been around for quite some time (Cannibal Holocaust in 1980 is credited as the first to use this format) and they do provide an effective way of adding an element of additional realism to a film. If you have a problem with this type of film don't watch it. Sounds simple enough, but quite a few people fail to grasp that.

Zombie Diaries 2 picks up sometime after the events of the first film. We are seeing what occurs through the video camera of one of the members of the military unit seen at the end of the first film. It's interesting watching how the military response is to the outbreak and the total collapse of all order. The unit is quickly overrun by the zombies and the survivors flee. This film does an effective job of creating and maintaining a sense of impending dread. Once the unit encounters a gang of predators (who were also seen for a brief moment in the first film) the horror of the overall situation becomes even clearer. If something like a zombie outbreak was to occur the worst elemenets of society would prosper. The biker gang from the original Dawn of the Dead is the best example of this type of behavior, but where they were organized this group isn't. People have complained about the two rape sequences but, these really are implied more then shown and, are used to show exactly how hideous the actions of the gang are. This film is ment for mature viewers and deals with adult subject matter. Have a problem dealing with that don't watch.",1333584000,3,1670,4.475409836065574
4592575,5,B0056OZHYE,"No, not the movie - the reviews.  The same hackneyed laundry list of criticisms  seems to follow every zombie movie made outside of a big studio - especially if it lacks the kind of puerile grossness zombie ""fans"" seem to find so engaging.  Bad acting (check); bad dialogue (check); bad direction (check); bad makeup (check).  The setting for Zombie Diaries 2 did get a Hail Mary Pass, though, so that can remain unchecked.  I thought - foolishly of course - that since the acting really was quite good, it would be left off the list this time around.  But no; bad acting is de rigueur, belonging in fact at the very top of the list, so it cannot be omitted from any conventional criticism.

There is, unfortunately, another laundry list - the list of absolutely mandatory mishaps in a zombie movie - and they're present and accounted for in this movie too.  The perimeter protecting the survivors from the zombies gets breached (check).  The getaway vehicle becomes disabled (check).  One of the survivors has to go relieve him or herself and is warned not to stray far but does anyway (check).  The survivors blindly wander through a big, dimly lit building filled with corridors in search of some unspecified something or another (check).  The survivors get trapped in a dead end, be it a corridor or the landscape itself (check).

To this list, the producer(s)/director of Zombie Diaries 2 added a couple unique elements.  The primary female character - Leann - was locked in a separate room within the ""safe"" compound; it's never revealed how or why she got there, but once she's given a military uniform and a gun she comes around - becoming, in fact, one of the best killing machines in the entire squad.  One member of the squad goes off to scout and learns the hard way that scouting is not his forte.  There are scenes of a group of heavily uniformed people rounding up and killing what appear to be non-zombies; but no indication if this routine is past, present or future.

Finally, a good bit of criticism has been leveled at the handy-cam mode, much in vogue of late.  Reviewers find it distracting and difficult to follow.  Perhaps it has been overdone, but I think it's more than merely a gimmick.  Its roots can be traced to literature, where for decades writers have been attempting to find a way around the ""omniscient narrator""; the best they've managed to come up with is first-person narration.  In film, the parallel would be the omnipresent camera, which sees everything everywhere all the time.  By using the hand-held camera as a tool of recording what's happening, the entire movie is seen literally through one character's eyes: the audience sees what he sees, no more, no less.  Ultimately, though, as with the omniscient narrator in a novel, there simply is no adequate replacement for the omnipresent camera.",1332720000,4,2839,4.772540983606557
4592576,4,B0056OZHYE,"This is a very good zombie flick.  With a few changes, it could have been my favorite of all.  Its still as good or better than everything except the Dawn of the Dead (both versions).",1326153600,,183,4.2
4592577,2,B0056OZHYE,"this is the sequel to
'zombie diaries' and to b fair that microbudget flick did quite well internationally. In fact after that movie we got tons of hand  held camera movies. Of course 'blair witch' started the whole thing but it went away until 'zombie diaries 1"". This sequel has alot more money than the first and it's still a very small budget in alot of ways. The whole hand hald camera thing should hopefully fade away in the future.  Unless you are really recording a event. The problem here is that recording hordes of zombies attacking you instead of fighting back is rather a bad idea. It barely worked in the first one and in 'survival of the dead' the cameraman is not a military man. The picture looks great on blu ray of course. And it's in widescreen which is a good thing. You can pick apart any zombie film though and find lots of characters doing really dumb things. The characters here at least make sense most of the time. ALthough a overrun barracks of soldiers with bloodless victims lying around is strange. That's how low budget this is. Sorta like chiller channels 'the remains' a zombie flick I saw last night. I recently saw the classic low budgeter 'children shouldn't play with dead things' from the early 70's and I got a kick out of it.  But to be fair non horror critics would trash 90% of all horror movies anyways. This has it's moments , for instance in spite of it's very, very low budget, they did a good job training the actors in military procedures, and they even used a decomissioned airbase in part of the story.  I love these shlocky movies and too often I give them three stars , but I just couldn't do it here because of the whole hand held cameraman thing. which to be fair this series really brought back into popularity!  This has three doctumentary extras on it. THe acting in this one is better than the first one and that's a plus. But non hand held fans should avoid this one, zombie fans have seen worse though.",1324771200,,1963,4.441666666666666
4592578,1,B0056OZHYE,"***Please read entirely before understanding the low rating-which is completely subjective. But then again...we all are, aren't we?***
How do they make the trailers look like they are regular movies, but it turns out to be yet another camera on the run movie, is beyond me. Or maybe it was my ADHD & I didn't pay as close attn to the trailer as I thought. Regardless, I was very disappointed, altho I was glad I rented it before buying it, which saved me some denarii. Albeit I have certainly wasted my fair share. It was all to easy to know what was going to happen. And I guess I am just too old for that caffeinated camera action. My 1st intro to the zombie world was at the Big Sky outdoor theater in Madison, WI, when Night of the Living Dead 1st came out int he 60's. I was in the middle seat behind my parents in our blue/while 1965 VW van. They fell asleep. But my mom woke up just as the girl was planting a garden in her mom's chest. My mom screamed for dad to wake up & leave ""This is a terrible movie. We're not watching it!"", or words to that effect.  It would be another 20+ yrs before I finally got to see that fateful ending. Of course, I was upset b/c the main movie I wanted to see was the last of the triple-header...""Day of the Triffids"". I now own that movie...but would you believe it, I still haven't sat down to watch it!
All this to say that since I saw the ending of the ""Night..."", I never stopped watching zombie movies. I've seen good, I've seen bad, & I've seen them in-between. Unfortunately this was disappointing. Not that the George Romero movies have uncanny plots. But there is an art to making the already-known/guessable seem at least somewhat surprising. I don't want to take away from those who enjoyed it. I know there are a great many movies many find ""dumb"" quite pleasant. Therefore this rating is purely subjectable. There are of course some movies that are simply outstanding, & some that are simply too awful to even involve God in (uh, as in God-awful, for the unlearned young). I say this b/c there are those who can like the Parkinsonian-camera action (pls, anyone suffering from or know someone suffering from this debilitating, awful disease, do not take offense...it is merely referring to the action...I am fully aware in this PC-riddled, thought-police filled society that somewhere someone is going to take offense b/c they either 1) don't have a sense of humor, 2) don't have common sense, 3) don't have any sense, 4) never had mama's milk, & of course 5) all the above & below. Or maybe they just never had a life & therefore in order to make up one they have decided to make the majority suffer for their lack of humanity. And yet they call themselves liberals...but alas I digest...I mean digress...I mean, i don;t know what I mean...i want to go home, Inspector!
The short of it is, this movie if only for those who like the Blair Witch camera action. If you don't like  that, save yourself the headache. If you do, & don't knowing what's going to happen (well, at least it was easy for me to figure it out), then by all means...have at it. My low rating is simply my take on it.

8459819,4,B0056OZHYE,"World of the Dead: The Zombie Diaries 2

 While not universally lauded, I found The Zombie Diaries 2 a more than worthy successor to the good quality original.  Like the first of the name, 2 has a man with a hand held camera filming the survivors of the Zombie Apocalypse for posterity.  I like this technique for a couple of reasons.  First, it gives an immediacy to the action that I appropriate.  When stuff happens, it happens right up in our grill.  We can almost smell the decay on the un-dead.  Second, I am pretty sure that it is a cheap way to film.  There are no Dolly's, no Dolly grips and that whole cumbersome baggage of cinematographic infrastructure to fund.  So as an artistic function and as a practical function, I approve.
 The Zombies here are an ever present over arching menace, but we only deal with them episodicly.  Our characters, soldiers, have a safe base to inhabit at the beginning of the film, some few months after the outbreak.  The writers have written in a  horrifying sub tale that gradually comes out about the government's way of dealing with infected or potentially infected people.  The surviving soldiers had a direct hand in that, while the government and the chain of command still existed.  When Zombies in a huge herd breach the perimeter of the base, the surviving soldiers make out across country to a coastal spot where boats will take them to Rotterdam and safety.
 What follows is an hour just about the most built in tension in any recent Zombie film.  We spend a lot of time fleeing from Zombies, creeping slowly through the darkness avoiding Zombies or in close order combat with Zombies.  Really good stuff.  Nothing that wasn't also done in the superb REC films, but still really good.
 And the film ends with a tiny flicker of hope rather than the certainty of human extinction, which I also like.  No body digs a downer.
 On the positive side I also put the acting, by a crew of professional actors with a score or multiple scores of credits on their sheets.  One of the banes of Zombie flicks is horrible acting but not here.  The direction is competent.  Michael Bartlett and Kevin Gates co-directed as they did the original Zombie Diaries.  Gates and Bartlett have achieved the status of professional directors with about five tallies each. Gates also returns as the script writer for both films.  He has a straight forward style with no snappy one liners or quips to distract us.
 In general, the production values come up to regular movie standards.  We had no issues with things like fluctuating sound intensity or odd continuity problems that sometimes plague low budget films.  The Zombies are traditional slow movers, the make up good but unpretentious and the fake guts realistic enough to make a person with a weak stomach queasy.
 On the down side Gates writes in two rape scenes that I thought could have been excluded.  In one a band of particularly vile bandits attempt to rape a Zombie until their leader puts an end to such foolery.  In the second, a captive female soldier is raped and murdered by a retarded boy in one of the most not nice things I have seen.  Didn't like that much and couldn't see the artistic reason for it.
 Still, warts and all, World of the Dead: The Zombie Diaries 2 rates a high three brains.  It runs for one hour and 28 minutes.  It deserves the strong R rating for violence, rape and the usual Zombie munching of humans.  They portrayed the human munching in graphic form without overdoing it.
