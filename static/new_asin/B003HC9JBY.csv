8442321,3,B003HC9JBY,"There are many reviews on this workout, but the ones that are her tend to be very high. However, I wasn't as impressed. Here's a quick breakdown of the good and the bad.

Pros:

Michaela probably gave me the clearest understanding of finding the core muscles and isolating them of any host/workout guru that I have ever heard. You always hear tighten the core, isolate the core, etc. but the videos I've worked with just don't explain it well, outside of 'pull your bellybutton into the spine.' What a great and careful demonstration she provides here.

The pushups were great. I, like many others, thought I couldn't do a push-up. However, I was able to do what she demonstrated, mostly on the floor, a couple on the wall. I FELT these workouts for days afterwords and really feel like I benefited greatly from them.

Michaela takes a lot of time describing each move. This is both great and tedious. The first few times that in-depth instruction helps to protect your body (back) and ensures that you have time to get into the proper position. However, after four times or so you're like 'get on with it already.' It would be nice if this were easily separated from the actual exercises so that as you advance you could go straight into the workout without the long explanation.

Cons:

I was really disappointed with the workout for the legs and behind. Based on the reviews I was expecting a hardcore workout. Instead, they were easy. I'm not being glib, and I'm not super fit. In fact, I'm overweight and only started working out (after being extremely fit for years and years) about a month and a half ago. The biggest problem with these movements is none were held long enough to create strong contractions in the muscles. The end result was just a sub par workout for those regions.

I'm not trying to pub other workouts - and I don't sell anything, but for the behind and hips I would suggest callanetics if you want to see some real results and really feel the pain when you're done. I made the switch from this to those and the difference is crazy.

Overall, this workout is just okay. The beginning and the arm exercises are great. The leg, thighs and butt exercises are just not targeted enough for real results fast. Still, it was worth viewing so that I could get the goods on the first part of the video.",1423526400,,2320,4.546762589928058
8442322,5,B003HC9JBY,"I love this workout at home and also use it when I travel so that I don't get stiff and lose flexibility.  The instruction is clear and the instructor is very professional and easy to follow.  The workout can be customized to make it more or less challenging and segments can be done using whatever time I have available.  No more excuses!  And, although this DVD came out in 2010, it is just as current for todays fitness enthusiasts.  Great job Michaela ~ I actually look forward to working out with you!",1410566400,,506,4.456521739130435
8442323,5,B003HC9JBY,"I've been looking for new exercises to revive my years old mat routines and I've found just what I needed! At the recommendation of a friend, I've invested in 3 of Michaela's videos: ""The Foam Roller"", ""Better Posture"" and ""Toned Arms, Buttocks and Thighs"".  I am absolutely thrilled with my results so far and just love the instructor!  I've taken many exercise classes over the years and can honestly say that I've never had a better  instructor. Michaela gives detailed, precise cues on body positioning and working safely towards more advanced moves. She reminds you of key muscles that should be engaged and the ones should relax.  She keeps you working and she does so with a smile and delightful sense of humour. My purchase was worth every penny!",1311897600,,754,4.821705426356589
8442324,5,B003HC9JBY,"To all women out there who want less flab in the back of their arms and more overall arm toning, a tight bum and shapely legs ... check out this video, the exercises really work! I've always dreaded push-ups, but no more.  Michaela explains really well what and how to do them, how to start and how to progress. An added bonus: my husband really enjoys my new butt.",1304208000,3,365,4.2898550724637685
8442325,4,B003HC9JBY,"As a man, I've  always felt self-conscious about going to Pilates and Yoga classes, because there are always more women than men in  class.
Bought similar DVD's in the past but found them lacking proper instruction for a quality workout. Pilates need to be done with attention to the body and specific muscles or one will not benefit much from it and may even risk injury. This is were you excel with the detailed and easy to follow instruction. The way you teach, is like I have personal instruction in my own living room and on demand. I can put a DVD on whenever I can find a some time. I bought 3 of your DVDs: Toned Arms, Buttocks and Thighs, Beginner Pilates in Detail and The Foam Roller. Soon will be trying the others in your collection. Thanks Michaela.",1290470400,,763,4.442857142857143
