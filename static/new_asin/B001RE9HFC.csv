8337796,5,B001RE9HFC,"This was my first ever zarzuela.  My friend, who is originally from Chile, and I both loved it.  I wish Pl&aacute;cido had recorded more zarzuela for dvd.  ~ Celeste Downey",1488499200,,172,4.666666666666667
8337797,5,B001RE9HFC,Placido Domingo has been one of the few singers. I admire I own most of his operas and and records. There is no equal to his voice.,1369094400,,131,3.888888888888889
8337798,3,B001RE9HFC,"This zarzuela is a story of competing love interests within a civil war setting. The music is OK and is sung well enough. The dialogue is somewhat stilted leading to stilted delivery however so the action lacks forward necessary momentum. This could not be described as a great musical or dramatic experience but perhaps passable enough to non-Spanish ears.

For me however, the main problem lies in the casting where we are expected to believe that the youngish heroine would favour a mature landowner over her previous lover - a soldier on the wrong side. Possible so far maybe but ... Domingo is simply too old and physically stiff for this part. Nor has he the fluent acting abilities that so many of the camera-aware younger generation of singers possess. I find this considerable disparity beyond the bounds of credibility!

So this is a disc primarily for Domingo fans who also have a partiality for zarzuela-styled compositions. This is apparently one of the best and most popular of its type.

I sold my DVD then tried again with the Blu-ray version! I sold that too! No-one could accuse me of not trying but ultimately this simply did not work for me but fans of Domingo especially may well not agree. There are better discs of this type of repertoire available in my opinion - but that is only one opinion after all. You may feel differently.",1343088000,,1353,4.72457627118644

I have been very familiar with the Zarzuela genre and in particular one that I like the most is Luisa Fernanda. I thought for a while I'd buy this production which I did as I was going to see it in the theater, but of course with a different cast.
I am glad to have bought this DVD, the scenery mainly in white and black was very effective although very simple, which the director said that he was more interesting in showing the way people live and dress more than the city with its buildings and landmarks.
The cast is very good with Placido Domingo in the role of Vidal, the rest of the cast was also great,Luisa fernanda and Javier played by Nancy Herrera and Jose Bross respectively were very good.
I like the idea that leave the end of the story open, people who are familiar with Luisa Fernanda know that she left Vidal to reunites with Javier, in this production she stands undecided between the two men, the director explained that he didn't want to give a definite ending because Vidal was the positive character who loves her unconditionally, Javier on the other hand was unfaithful and selfish.
The sound and quality of the DVD was perfect. I enjoyed it a lot.",1329436800,,1335,5.04524886877828
8337800,5,B001RE9HFC,"I had never heard or seen  Zarzuela before. As I like World music, I thought I would see what this art form was all about. It is very Spanish. It is the opposite of Anglo- Saxon offerings. No hiding of emotions. All passion and waving of hands and tuneful. I kept  shouting OLE at the wrong places. Then I rushed off and played my CD's of Flamenco music loudly. The neighbours shouted out, ""turn that rubbish down"". I would not, so they played rap to drown out my offerings.

 Appearently, traditional Zarzuela has some sort of social message and the characters are usually working class people. The composer of this piece Torroba,introduced  this Spanish art form to international audiences. I gather that  Luisa Fernanda is middle class. I suppose this was to make this art form acceptable to the elites. I am amazed that the working class did not rebel and firmly state that they want their art form back. Poor Spanish workers, Flamenco and Zazuela has been pinched by the elites. As Peter Sellers once said"" What about the workers.""

The conductor is Jesus Lopez Cobos and the  Madrid Symphony orchestra in the Teatro Real. He seemed inspired, conducting what must be a piece so familar to him, because he grew up with it. Luisa Fernanda is Nancy Herrera, a beautiful passionate voice. Jose Bros,tenor in the same class. Domingo's parents sang this piece many times, in Mexico I believe. So he grew up with singing. I can throughly recommend this piece. Very entertaining. Not like operetta. I did recognize some flamenco tunes.",1309392000,,1532,4.776515151515151
8337801,4,B001RE9HFC,"In my opinion, opera should be fun to watch, not just fun to listen to. On this performance the staging is minimal and the wardrobe is plain and unatractive. There is what seems to be a projection screen behind the performers which presents a white rectangle on a black background that grows or shrinks according to the action. That is the sum total of the scenography for this opera, aside for some chairs and tables used by the performers on stage (!). Given the fact that the singing and the orchestral performance on this disc are excellent, this poor scenographic choice detracts from the value of the performance. What a waste of a chance to produce a memorable disc!",1279670400,,673,4.663865546218488
8337802,4,B001RE9HFC,"I find reviewing this music is difficult as it really is not opera in the usual Italian etc sense so is better termed an operetta.  All the music was completely new to me but much of it was very tuneful although seemed to lack passion and drama despite the much praised singing of Domingo backed up by a good cast. The story centered around two suitors for the hand of Luisa with a backdrop of conflict between Monarchists and revolutionaries, something which should have proved more dramatic than I felt.  But then are operettas meant to be dramatic?

The staging was sparse with costuming generally white for the ladies and black for the men.  Brighter costumes might have improved visual appeal and given a greater Spanish air to the production but that is not a major item.

The video and audio quality was up to the usual Blu Ray standards and it is very possible this disc would become more enjoyable on repeated viewings as one became more familiar with the music.  Apparently the original production had a lot more dialogue but that was thankfully omitted.

So, disregard my personal lack of enthusiasm as it might very well appeal to you as it obviously does to many others.",1272499200,,1183,4.658653846153846
8337803,3,B001RE9HFC,"Excelente puesta en escena, eso si extraa maqueta aparece en primer plano, no entiendo porqu siendo una grabacin reciente slo se limiten a sonido estreo y no emplearon sonido envolvente.
Excellent presentation, that if strange model appears in the foreground, not understand why being a recent recording only be limited to stereo sound and not employed surround sound.",1260576000,,368,5.362068965517241
8337804,5,B001RE9HFC,This is one of the last opportunities to hear Placido and that Zarzuela performance performed by himself and Jiosep Bros. A real pleasure to hear and watch.,1259280000,,156,4.814814814814815
8337805,5,B001RE9HFC,"First, be sure to buy the Blu-ray disc (the one featured on this Amazon page), not the regular DVD. It's musical performances like this one that make you truly appreciate the format. The image is so sharp and the sound so clear and immersive that it's nearly as enjoyable an experience as being at the performance itself.

While the price for Opus Arte Blu-rays is high compared to that of other labels, their extremely well-produced discs are well worth the extra dollars. For perspective, consider: It's much less than you would have paid to sit in the theater, with the plus that you can see it again and again.

The performance of ""Luisa Fernanda"" here is just about ideal. The dialogue has been severely cut. In the bonus feature, Placido Domingo makes it clear that this decision was done consciously to make zarzuela more accessible to non-Spanish audiences. To my mind, this is a good thing. The plot -- what there is of it -- remains easy to follow, and the focus rests, as it should, on Federico Moreno Torroba's beautiful music.

Traditionalists might also have an issue with the staging here, since it's quite modern. The sets are minimal, and it's left to the costumes to provide period atmosphere. It worked for me.

For the most part, this performance offers all one could wish for musically. Domingo, in particular, is extraordinarily good in the baritone role of Vidal, both vocally and in terms of acting (in the past, he's sung Javier, the tenor role). Keep in mind that at the time of this taping he had already been singing for about half a century! You'd never know it, based on the fine state of his voice and his full commitment. Surely, no one in the history of opera has given performances of such a high caliber for so long. He's truly a wonder and we'll never see his like again, which is why we should all be grateful that performances like this one have been captured in high-definition video.

As you'll find out in the lightweight but enjoyable bonus feature, ""Luisa Fernanda"" holds strong sentimental value for both Domingo and the director of this production, since performers in their families have had close ties to the work for about 75 years. It's obviously a labor of love for them, and we, the viewers of this performance, are the beneficiaries.",1255824000,4,2285,4.7025
