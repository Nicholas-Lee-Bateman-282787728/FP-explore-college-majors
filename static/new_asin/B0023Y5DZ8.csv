8350148,5,B0023Y5DZ8,"Also implicated are Ronald Reagan, Tony Blair and Saudi Prince Baldar, a close friend of the Bush family. and BAE Systems, which sold an airplane to the Saudi royal family in exchange for bribes in violation of international treaties against bribery. Many of these bribery cases have not yet been solved and most perpetrators have not admitted their guilt. Other serious cases of bribery  are still pending.",1389744000,3,407,5.074626865671642
8350149,5,B0023Y5DZ8,"I'll warn you that you may be clenching your fists the entire time that you're watching this. The fact that international business is so dependent on bribery and other such underhanded schemes is actually really scary, but not all that surprising. A lot of dirty laundry is aired in this documentary. Obviously it isn't a super long video so it is more of an overview as most PBS documentaries are but it's worthwhile.",1277769600,8,418,4.739726027397261
8350150,5,B0023Y5DZ8,"All these episodes from Frontline are required viewing although as always there are specific episodes that always seem to stand out. The corporate media rarely if ever touches upon the subject of International Bribery or as it's labeled here Black Money. I was looking forward to watching this. I wasn't disappointed with what the people of Frontline were able to put together.

This a full, fact based look at international bribery from US to UK to Saudi Arabia. You get a whole main course on corruption involving not just these countries but neighboring countries as well.

Bribery of course is nothing new, but Frontline really does its job of getting all evidence to show how it's done. You won't look at the UK the same again.

The US has a long record of corruption and bribery but so do other countries. Specifically here the episodes shows how the UK was involved in a shady deal with Saudi Arabia to get firearms and create jobs.

They also show you how Saudi Arabia (the same place where the 911 hijackers came from)using a few idle threats got the UK and US to back down (or go along with them)to back down with their investigations on black money.

A lot of people will easily shrug this off. However, it's totally naive to assume that bribery doesn't exist in this world and people and things aren't bought off.

You also see how Ronald Reagan, Margaret Thatcher were also involved in bribery. Draw your own conclusions.

I really enjoyed this episode. It was to say the least very informative.

On the sad side, it's also unsettling how all of these countries engage in these activities while professing to fight for truth, justice and fairness in a world dominated by bribery, corruption and money.

Like I said, just watch it, draw your conclusions. For me, I wasn't surprised by anything they uncovered.",1249689600,17,1821,4.737341772151899
