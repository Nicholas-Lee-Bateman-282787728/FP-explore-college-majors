6440338,4,B00KQ82JKA,"Consider this an introduction to the Justice League as seen in the DC Animated Universe. The DCAU was an award-winning series of interconnected super-hero television series made from the 90's and 00's, which raised the standard of super-hero cartoons, for writing, acting and animation.
NOTE: All of these episodes have been available in series season sets from the various programs.
NOTES FOR PARENTS: The discs are ""NOT RATED"" but I believe all episodes were aired as ""TV Y-7 FV"" (designed for older children/fantasy violence). They were all made-for-TV; and NOT direct-to-video, so don't expect the level of bloodshed seen in the direct-to-video discs. Parents, still use your discretion.
The first 6 episodes are actually three two-part stories which were aired as part of the ""Justice League"" series. In that show, the JL had seven members: Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, Flash, Green Lantern, Hawkgirl, and the Martian Manhunter. (Note: this isn't the same Green Lantern character featured in the movie, or the CGI series; this Green Lantern is John Stewart, an African-American ex-marine.)
The next 5 episodes were part the Justice League's sequel series, ""Justice League Unlimited,"" which expanded the JL to an international team with about 60 members, many of whom appear here. Also expanded were the cast of villains. Literally dozens of famous and minor DC Comics characters appeared in the three seasons of ""JLU"" (not all are seen here in these episodes).
The final two episodes, ""The Call,"" parts 1 and 2, appeared in the lesser known series ""Batman Beyond."" Set in the future, this Batman is a young man trained by an elderly Bruce Wayne to be the next guardian of Gotham. These two episodes have Batman with the future Justice League of Superman, Big Barda (who appeared in ""JLU""), Aquagirl (Aquaman's daughter), Warhawk (son of Hawkgirl and John Stewart), and another Green Lantern, a child named Kai-ro. The team battle an alien who was the bad guy in the very first Justice League comic book story more than 50 years ago.
BOTTOM LINE: Collectors may already have all of these episodes on disc. But for the DCAU newcomer, or younger Justice League fan, sit back and enjoy.",1420070400,10,2190,5.069252077562327
6440339,1,B00KQ82JKA,WB or whoever is making this dvd available for sale should be ashamed of themselves. The least they could do is make it clear that these are episodes from an earlier series so that people who already brought the series will not be purchasing what they already have. This is sick trickery and some one needs to protest sufficiently to teach then a lesson.,1418947200,22,354,4.546875

6440344,1,B00KQ82JKA,"The DVD is just a repackaging of the Justice League series that had already come out years ago.
When I bought this DVD I thought it was new material.  I was mistaken. I already have both seasons
of Justice League.",1412812800,55,213,4.325
6440345,3,B00KQ82JKA,I just do not understand why DC Comics keeps wasting money on DVD sets like this. They need to (although they probably never will) release Static Shock completely on DVD and release the second season of The Zeta Project on DVD.,1458777600,,227,4.560975609756097

6440357,1,B00KQ82JKA,A total rip-off if you have already purchased the entire line of DC animated series and features. WB should be ashamed for not making it clear that these are re-packaged already published shows rather than leading us on the think they are brand new episodes. If they think the shows are popular enough to re-package then they should not have stopped making new episodes.,1434758400,5,370,4.796875

On that note, it will have your little ones falling in love as well.  Lots of characters, lots of battles, equals lots of FUN here.

Good buy.",1427673600,2,313,4.344827586206897

8660738,2,B00KQ82JKA,"You may not have been able to realize it from the promotional text, but this is NOT new material. It's just a few episodes of the old Justice League Unlimited TV show. Granted, that was a great show and these were particularly good episodes, but I was very disappointed when I realized that this was yet another re-re-packaging of stuff that's been in circulation for a decade or more. If you are among the few JLU/DCU fans who don't already owns these episodes, this is worth picking up.",1522108800,,488,4.556818181818182

8660745,5,B00KQ82JKA,"I don't own this DVD but I'm writing this review to offset all the bad ones. There has been some confusion about what this DVD is so just to clarify this is just a rerelease of episodes from the Justice League animated series. I understand the frustration that people that bought this have but it took me all of 60 seconds to find out exactly what this is, it's printed on the back of the box which is right there in the images for the product page. That being said you might be better off buying the complete series which is great.",1461888000,2,532,4.2254901960784315
