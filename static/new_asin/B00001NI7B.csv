Aisha shows off some of her C'trl C'trl attacks (or atleasts explains some of them). The three manage to escape her, but she finds them again. After using up her power by powering up, Gene takes her out to dinner. Aisha, being ungrateful, immedietly challenges Gene after eating. Gene finds an extra caster shell he has left and paralizes Aisha. The three take off in the new Outlaw Star as Aisha stays behind and washes dishes. Next up, the three visit Fred, an old friend of Gene. Fred, however, is in danger when an assaisan named Suzuka trys to kill him. Gene is on the case. He challenges her into a dual and after embaressing her in combat, she admits defeat and Suzuka is left in defeat. This volume shows off some of the many cool characters as Outlaw Star. The Japanese voice Aisha (performed by the same person who did the voice for Auska in Evangelion) is done very well. Suzuka is very deadly and very cool. A must-have volume.",978739200,3,1104,4.47029702970297
