1057482,1,6305600988,"One reviewer said that this film ""proves"" the Bible to be ""baloney"". It does nothing of the kind. All it proves is that Hollywood is steeped in anti-religious propaganda. The film is full of caricatures that make no sense. The so-called prayer meeting alone illustrates that the script writer has never attended an actual prayer meeting. The ridiculous charge that a Bible believer can't see reason or that evolutionism is equivalent to ""science"" or ""reason"" shows that there is not much intelligence in the whole structure of the film. The film itself is, of course, a propaganda reaction to the very serious evidence against evolutionism. No wonder that Hollywood's so-called stories ""based on a real event"" can't really be taken seriously.",1235260800,2,742,5.140495867768595

1057484,5,6305600988,"This 1999 TV reproduction is not as funny as the 1960 movie version with the same title, but it is still very good.  The content is almost identical to the earlier movie version, but the actors are less funny.  The whole thing is based on the 1925 Monkey Trial in Tennessee where a high-school teacher called Scope was arrested for having once taught evolution in class.  The ensuing trial attracted international attention.  Though Scope was convicted and fined $100, the fundamentalist Christians who interpret the Bible literally are depicted as clowns in the movie.",1177977600,,569,5.0212765957446805
1057485,5,6305600988,"Jack Lemmon and George C. Scott steal the movie!. It is a real pity  we don't have the wonderful Jack Lemmon still around with us to bring us fine pieces of work like this. We'll miss you, Jack. :(
What I find a real shame is that MGM/UA has still NOT released this movie in DVD format, and that both editions of this movie (the 1960  original and this remake) are ""out of stock"" even in vhs format.
What are the movie studios up to?. I want to buy the movie and I can't. Maybe they are cornering us into piracy?.",1075507200,17,513,4.069306930693069
1057486,5,6305600988,"As a high school science teacher I deal with common myths and misconceptions involving evolution on a daily basis.  This movie does a nice job of helping kids understand the passion of the issue.  Evolution is the cornerstone of modern day biology and it is important kids understand why it needs to be taught.  The amazing thing about science is that if evidence comes along to disprove a current school of thought, the discipline may change.  When religion is questioned the only response is to lash out with hostility and anger.  Why can't we question the way Man believes in God?",976579200,11,583,4.732673267326732
1057487,5,6305600988,"A truly excellent remake of an American classic.  Once you get past any inital reservations you may (understandably) have about the film's  made-for-cable origins, you will find a work that is, in my opinion, just  as engaging as the 1960 version.  Two gripes: 1. As mentioned by another  reviewer, the direction and camera work is a bit static and elementary. 2.  As also mentioned by another reviewer, Beau Bridges at times is too  obnixious and over the top.  On the other hand, Jack Lemmon and George  C. Scott (in his final performace) are absolutely riveting.  Piper Laurie  is also very compelling as Scott's sympathetic and diplomatic wife.  This incarnation of the film is extremely faithful to its predecessor,  virtually a frame by frame re-shoot. Yet the dialouge, performaces and  subject matter are just as fresh and stirring as they were 40 years ago.  Fans of the 1960 release should certainly enjoy, or at least appreciate  this latest adaption.",967248000,29,962,4.993670886075949
1057488,4,6305600988,"Hold the phone. It's a remake that's almost as good as the original.

Much of the brilliance of the new version of Inherit the Wind comes from finding two old fogeys who have the same love/hate chamistry brought  to life in the original by Frederic March and Spencer Tracy; in this case,  the friendly adversaries are George C. Scott, in his last performance  before his death, and Jack Lemmon. Toss in Beau Bridges as the wisecracking  journalist and a surprisingly downbeat performance by Thom Evertt Scott as  the teacher who ends up a guinea pig in one of the biggest trials of the  century, and you got yourself a fine film. The comic timing is impeccable  on all counts, the lines from the film that have become cliche are  delivered with the same freshness that ignited them decades ago, and one  can almost believe that Scott and Lemmon actually are Bryan and Darrow  haggling it out in a Tennessee courtroom.

If you've never seen  _Inherit the Wind_, start with the classic Spencer Tracy/Frederic March  version from 1960. If you're a fan of the film already, and have been  avoiding this remake because nothing can do the original justics, well,  you're right... but it comes as close as possible.",961286400,16,1208,4.735576923076923
1057489,3,6305600988,"This film is a remake of a 1960 movie about the 'Scopes' monkey trial in July of 1925, argued by prominent statesman William Jennings Bryan (for the prosecution and the Bible) and equally the prominent Clarence Darrow (for  the defense, scientific thought and Darwin). Rather than compare it with  the original, which I understand was brilliant, I will evaluate it on its  own.
This is a powerful and thought provoking courtroom drama about a  school teacher who was arrested for teaching evolution, then considered a  heresy against God and the bible. The topic is unfortunately as timely  today as it was 75 years ago. The film is extremely effective at  illustrating the pervasive ignorance and fear so prevalent in  fundamentalist religions. It depicts with great clarity, the frenzied and  irrational efforts undertaken to suppress any knowledge that threatens to  debunk the myth and simple minded traditions that bind the faithful  together.
Unfortunately, the presentation of the story had certain flaws  that kept it from being a truly great film. My biggest objections are all  directorial. First, this film was visually mediocre and pedestrian. The  camera basically followed the speaker around the room at the same angles  from pretty much the same distances. There were very few reaction shots  which would have greatly enhanced the drama. I don't think there was a  single reaction shot of any member of the jury and only a couple from the  gallery.
Director Daniel Petrie takes enormous artistic license in  presenting the trial. The way it was portrayed it seemed more like an  unmoderated debate between the lawyers than a criminal trial with rules of  court. Granted, it was a small town in 1925, but this was ridiculous. In  real trials, lawyers have two opportunities to give speeches in a trial, in  opening and closing statements. During the trial itself, they are only to  ask questions and gather evidence under very strict rules. They can't give  speeches or lead the witness or inject their opinion about a witness'  testimony. This was flouted in the film as lawyers violated these rules  repeatedly with nary an objection from the other side. Ironically, the most  important speeches of the trial, closing arguments were completely missing  from the film.
I found Jack Lemon's portrayal of defense lawyer Henry  Drummond to be disturbingly restrained. Lemon is clearly capable of  unfettered rage and indignation, yet he played his character with  resignation and defeatism rather than frustration and wrath. He simply  didn't fight hard enough for the principles in which he supposedly  believed. I blame this on Petrie.
Without question, the performance of  the film belonged to George C. Scott in his last performance before his  death (a stunning coincidence since William Jennings Bryan, on whom Scott's  character is based, died shortly after this trial. So it was his last  performance as well). Scott is magnificent as the bible thumping prosecutor  rattling the rafters of the little courthouse with his booming gravel  voice. This was the type of part Scott was born to play and it may have  been his best performance since Patton. For this reason alone this film  should be on every film buff's list. If only Lemon brought similar fire to  his part, this film would have been riveting.
Beau Bridges was a bit  overly obnoxious as the sardonic reporter E.K. Hornbeck. The role called  for a good deal of cynicism, but Bridges got carried away.
Lane Smith  gives a terrific performance as the Lord possessed Reverend Brown, who  damns his own daughter to hell for refusing to renounce her love for her  fiance Cates, the accused school teacher. His sermon at the prayer meeting  was more than worthy of any cable TV evangelist.
I gave this film a 7/10.  I think it would be rated higher by most people who think of a courtroom as  more of a dramatic setting than place of justice. Overall it is a credible  update of a topic that should remain in the forefront of our minds if we  hope to continue living in a free and rational society.",955929600,20,4073,4.9482248520710055
1057606,5,6305600988,"I was only 14 years old when I watched this film. I remember its name as ""TRIAL OF APE"". The motion pictures then was pure like everything.

1057607,4,6305600988,"George C. Scott and Jack Lemmon, while not quite up to the standards of Spencer Tracy, do a remarkable job in the repeating thee 1960 film  ""Inherit the Wind.""

The script is trash -- it's from the stage play of the same title.  You need to read Professor Edward J. Larson's history, SUMMER FOR THE GODS, based on the actual trial records and interviews regarding the 1925 Skopes Monkey Trial to see what really happened. The movie ""Alleged"" is a much better movie historically, which seems to be based on Larson's history of the Skopes Monkey Trial.",1355961600,,550,4.649484536082475

1057610,5,6305600988,"Years ago, I had rented a VHS copy of this movie & soon wanted to add this movie to my collection. I had seen the original with Spencer Tracy, but didn't like it as well as the remake. Plus, with the remake having George C Scott & Jack Lemmon, two of my fave actors, made me want the movie in my collection all the more. I was unable to find a DVD copy of this movie until only fairly recently. Needless to say, I bought it pretty quick & had it sent to my home.

1057611,5,6305600988,"""Inherit the Wind,"" an electrifying drama, is based on the famous evolution versus creation theory of Charles Darwin.  When a small Bible belt town learns that a young teacher has dared introduce his students to the theory of evolution, they jail him for teaching blasphemy. The courtroom face off brings together God-fearing Matthew Harrison Brady (read William Jennings Bryant) and Henry Drummond (read Clarence Darrow), Brady's worthy adversary. Written in 1955, the drama blasted McCarthyism. In 2011, the play gives us bombastic overtones of the current political scene. Overall, this is a testament, as Drummond puts it, ""to the right to think."" While I appreciate both the Jack Lemon, George C. Scott production and the Spencer Tracy, Frederic March film, my preference is to the intensity of the former.",1301788800,2,811,5.286821705426356

I had already seen the original with Spencer Tracy quite a while before I bought the remake, but I have to admit, when you think of movie remakes, the people who made this remake of ""Inherit The Wind"", they hit a home run with this one!",1281312000,5,642,3.9083969465648853

7892713,3,6305600988,"While I was excited to receive an updated, colored version for my classroom, this made-for-television version cannot compare to the classic 1960 film. The actors, although respectable, do not play the parts with half the passion and force which Frederick March or Spencer Tracy displayed in the original. However, I must admit Beau Bridges played Hornbeck rather similarly to Gene Kelley; he had that similar charm, wit and cynicism.

  The one scene which makes this worth buying is the prayer meeting! My students enjoyed that part very much since the actor was even crazier than the actor who played the Reverand in the original. He also was more animated. They really dramatized this scene well, although I am not sure we were supposed to be laughing!

  Save your money, and buy the original! I decided to only show the prayer meeting and stick to the original which helps the students understand the drama very well.",1363996800,3,922,4.916129032258064
