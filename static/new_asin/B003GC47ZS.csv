8396451,5,B003GC47ZS,"I saw ""Ava & Gabriel"" earlier this year at the Thalia Theatre here in New York City this year. It was an excellent movies and later on was lucky enough to purchase a DVD copy for a friend from Art Mattan Studio. Now with both movies sold as a package this is a great deal. I saw ""Papa's Song"" some years ago on cable and now am super happy to add this to my collection. I hope Art Mattan will soon release ""Almacita, Soul of Desolato"" and ""Desir&eacute;e"" directed by Felix De Rooy thru Amazon at a decent price so more people can become aware of the Director.",1281312000,2,560,4.194444444444445
