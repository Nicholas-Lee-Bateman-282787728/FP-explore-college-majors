8014427,5,B0001MBSGM,Arrived when expected and in good condition.  Loved the film.  Exciting and acted well by all especially Barbara Eden who we have gown to know as starring in musical comedy.,1524355200,,173,4.733333333333333

8014429,3,B0001MBSGM,"Made for television, ...(and it shows!), this seventies supposed suspense piece is set in Acapulco.
(Good advice: If you happen to be making a C grade movie that you know has little chance of making millions, ALWAYS set it in some highly desirable location and then at least the crew will get a great holiday.)

Now the plot has more holes than a very old fishing net much in need of repair, so it doesn't stand up to any real analysis.
People's motives and actions make little sense after you learn the supposed twist in the end...but like me you will probably see this coming long before it is ""revealed"".

Barbara Eden (she of the I Dream of Jeannie fame) is the star here and frankly her character is quite poorly written and very one-dimensional. (As are all three of the leads.)
 She is suffering post traumatic stress after having run somebody down and killed them whilst driving. She's been acquitted, and is also fabulously rich, having a great many expensive jewels.
After a whirlwind courtship, she's now married to an ex-beach bum played by Robert Vaughn (he of the Man From Uncle fame)...yes I know it's a stretch to believe him as ever having been a beach bum, or indeed even appearing with his shirt off at all.
He always looks totally bored to me, whatever role he's in and this is no exception here.
He's trying to break into property development but is apparently lacking in capital and somewhat cold in response to his wife as a husband too.
However he desperately needs her to invest her money in his upcoming venture.
You can already see where this is going? Uh-huh!
Enter the only other character in the form of an enigmatic ""stalker"" played by Stuart Whitman who rents the house next door and contrives to constantly enter Eden's life.
Now to say that Whitman is too old for the part is something of an understatement.
Taking him down to the teenager's shop and decking him out in clingy flowery shirts and tight pants, then giving him a jet black wig the size of a haystack, while dyeing his copiously overgrown eye-brows jet black to match in no way disguises that he's just FAR too aged to play a romantic possibility for Barbara Eden! Creepy comes immediately to mind.
His face looks as though he's seen the bottoms of FAR too many bourbon bottles!

Anyway due to the fact that there are only THREE major characters here, the possibilities are very restricted.
You know the sort of thing. If it's not him,  then it's got to be him? (Literally!)
There are just no other possibilities on offer at all, so the ending will come as no surprise to anyone astute enough to realise this....and you will, ....early on!
Barbara LOOKS great, .....and manages (just) to show significant acting skills to suggest an unbalanced state of mind, but she's given a very odd solo ""sexy"" dance sequence at a party that seems absurdly out of place for her character.
Must admit I did at times expect her to fold her arms and blink herself invisible when she's caught in some tense situations, just as she did back in ""Jeannie""!
The sets and costumes are all a true triumph of the seventies....otherwise known as ""The Decade Taste Forgot"".

Now without giving any spoilers, as mentioned above, when the end comes and your ever growing suspicions are confirmed, if you start to think back on the actions of the characters throughout the story, then things just don't gel at all.
Robert Vaughn's character in particular, but he's not the only one.
Just why they did what they did, apparently knowing what they knew at the time, makes little sense.

Anyway, .....Chekov it most certainly ain't , ...it's a telemovie and if you wish to see Eden out of her pink harem costume, and marvel at the tasteless follies of the 70's, (some of the women's makeup and hair has to be seen to be believed!) then this lightweight little time filler will provide all that.
Just don't analyse, or look for any great highs in acting, directing or writing.

I didn't really ""like"" this movie, but going on what it is and what it was made for I'd have to say ""It's okay"" , and according to Amazon, that's three stars.....although I still think that's a bit high.
Still,... curiosity value now perhaps?",1432771200,,4183,4.6280323450134775

8014431,2,B0001MBSGM,"This picture was released on September 19 1972 starring Barbara Eden as Dina Hunter, Robert Vaughn as Jerry Hunter and Stuart Whitman as Paul Carter. Dina Hunter and her husband are going on vacation to Mexico. While in Mexico, some international people get the idea that Dina has many jewels that are worth millions. Things start to happen to the point that Dina starts to get paranoid and to her disbelief that her husband doesn't believe her. I bought this movie because of Barbara Eden and I was somewhat disappointed. The Barbara Eden that was in this movie and the one that played the role of Jeanie where two different people. To me this movie also lacks action and drama. It was hard to stay interested in this picture that's why I'm giving this movie only 5 weasel stars.",1390089600,,780,4.618705035971223

8014433,5,B0001MBSGM,"This was a must to buy for me because of Barbara Eden, I have crushed on this woman before I knew what crushing or lust or anything like that meant. But with Robert Vaughn and Stuart Whitman, that is just bonus, all of these people are just great actors. It of course has a touch of your 70's filming, the 70's were famous for using up time with driving scenes but this movie wasn't too bad in that area. It actually had a good suspense who done it type theme. If you area fan of the real time classic actors, this is a must to have.",1379116800,,533,4.037735849056604
