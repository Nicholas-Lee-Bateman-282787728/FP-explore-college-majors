This is a great hentai movie very well done. It's really romantic and beautiful. I'm so happy I found it again.",1355184000,3,297,4.481481481481482
8024556,4,B00029NM0O,"Thanks, Movie Mars Inc. (And of coarse, Amazon) for such a fast delivery.  And over the weekend none of the less.  You ""guys"" are the best.

What makes a Hentai exceptional and profound?  Careful thought, planning and attention to detail.  Wet Summer Days has ALL of this and SO much more!  The only reason I'm giving it a four-star rating is because I think the love-making scenes could have been a little more lengthy.  That would have given the participants more time for sensual conversation during their special time together.  Other then that, it's VERY beautiful and moving.  I especially liked the cel paintings at the end of each episode.  There are three episodes altogether giving it a total running time of ninety minutes, and each episode has its own series of ""cels"" pertaining to that particular episode.  I highly recommend this animated masterpiece to anyone who's either starting a Hentai collection or for veterans who have been collecting for a while.

Speaking of masterpieces, that's basically the storyline behind this Hentai.  Specifically about a man who specializes in, get this, death themed paintings.  The other two episodes revolve around death and the sacrifice one must make in order to save someone else near and dear.  As macabre as it sounds, this Hentai, in my opinion, is a MUST BUY!  Don't delay, order today!",1289865600,,1347,4.946428571428571
8024557,4,B00029NM0O,"If I were a professor at a film school and wanted to demonstrate the difference between erotic film and pornographic film--particularly in the context of anime--I would use this DVD. Yes, there's quite frank depictions of sex, but it isn't for the most part gratuitous; it happens for mostly the same reasons that it does in the 'real world'; between people who already have established an intimate connection.

This is a good movie (well, 3 episodes of a 'series', really) from an aesthetic point of view, too. The sex is consensual; no ropes, tentacles, violence, etc. The male and female participants are all attractive (but with believable bodies, at least for 18-20 yr olds) and all seem to be enjoying themselves. There ARE some fantastical elements, some of them a little cliched at this point (i.e. the 'disappearing girl', the combination multiple personality/shapeshifting girl, some Shinto haunting/ghost elements, etc) but they're low-key and interwoven nicely into an otherwise sturdy drama.",1214870400,11,1004,5.275
