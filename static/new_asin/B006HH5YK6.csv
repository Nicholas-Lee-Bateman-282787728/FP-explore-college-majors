4990104,1,B006HH5YK6,This appears to be Live at the Budokan taken from the 1974 appearance on Japanese TV. The 1972 Karen looked much different than she appears on this rehashing of a previous released DVD. It's not worth the money if you already have the Budokan DVD.,1330300800,7,247,4.511111111111111
4990105,5,B006HH5YK6,"This DVD is so good - the choice of songs, the camera work, the price, and the enjoyment of finally being able to watch The Carpenters makes this release 5-Star.  I highly recommend this DVD to anyone who appreciates Karen's voice and their style.  Some of the live material that has been released before has not impressed me that much - and I was skeptical of this release.  The subtitiles that appear (at times) is the only thing that is wrong with this DVD - annoying, but the performance OVERPOWERS the annoyance.  We can only hope that the Carpenters television specials may be released someday - of course with Richard's approval",1330214400,3,635,4.693693693693693
4990106,5,B006HH5YK6,"Steven Ramm's review of this DVD is excellent, so let me apologize if I repeat a few of his points while adding a few more comments.

I believe this is an unauthorized or maybe even a ""bootleg"" DVD. The DVD case and setup of the video content on the DVD certainly isn't up to the standards Richard Carpenter would require if he was involved with this release, as we all know he is a consummate perfectionist. As Mr. Ramm mentioned, this is marked as being an XXL Media release. There's no printed address or contact information anywhere on the DVD case for this company, nothing printed on the DVD itself, and the typical FBI warning, copyright and ownership information is entirely missing from the DVD. I did a quick search on Yahoo for ""xxl media carpenters in performance"" and nothing showed up; I stopped looking after 50 non-responsive hits.

I mostly don't condone buying unauthorized issues, and the quality is usually lower than what is officially released. But if the performances are decades old and probably not ever going to be officially released by the original artists before we die, you can't blame diehard fans of a group for buying something new when it comes along. Usually fans like us have bought up everything officially released anyway, and are such stong proponents of the group that we seek out every bit of rare material we can find to appreciate the group even more. However if this is a bootleg, I'm surprised it would show up for sale on amazon.com, so maybe it's not.

This is a real DVD, not a DVDR. I suspect it was manufactured in Japan, as that's where this concert was filmed. The DVD runs a little under an hour so this was probably filmed as a special for television, also that explains the Japanese subtitles. There are no opening or ending titles or credits at all. In fact, the video starts abruptly, mid-song into ""Superstar""; I thought the disc had skipped and pushed the previous button. ""Superstar"" segues into ""Rainy Days and Mondays"". Although the cover claims this was 1972, I believe it was filmed around 1976, or 1977 based on how Karen and Richard appear.

The audio quality is very good, monophonic. The musicianship and performances are excellent. Karen's and Richard's talents are awesome, and they and the band are able to viritually recreate and duplicate the way the studio recordings sounded in live performance, but with enough variations in the vocals, piano and other instruments to freshen the material. It's great to see Karen actually drumming on several songs too, live as opposed to synced to a studio track. Tony Peluso's guitarwork is less restrained than on the studio recordings, a little more spark in his guitar solos. The bass player, saxophonist, drummer etc are all good players. It's great to see them all performing together live.

This is really a wonderful DVD for Carpenters fan even if it maybe isn't an official release. Chances are it won't be around very long, so better get this while you can.",1330128000,20,2978,4.774757281553398
4990107,5,B006HH5YK6,I know that as the world's biggest Carpenters fan I'm predjudiced but I love this DVD. This is the concert video I've been waiting for since I saw them live in 1974 with a similar playlist. Seeing Karen looking healthy and singing like an angel is a dream come true. The video and audio quality are both good. Sometimes when I think of Karen's untimely death I alternate between anger and sadness (I had a huge crush on her back in the day) but watching her in her prime makes me grateful for what she left us. I don't know why Richard has always been so resistant to releasing live albums and DVDs or the best of their specials on DVD. If you consider yourself any kind of Carpenters fan you will love it.,1330128000,3,706,4.276119402985074
4990108,4,B006HH5YK6,"The only reason why I don't give this DVD 5 stars is simply because the video quality isn't that good. I don't know if this video was originally made from a bootleg or not, but regardless of whether this came from a bootleg or not,just hearing and seeing Karen Carpenter makes this DVD worthwhile. Listening to her Sing the song ""Sing"" in japanese is absolutely tremendous.  I'm surprised that Richard Carpenter has not released a more quality version of the Carpenters live in concert. Releasing the Carpenters TV Specials would also be welcomed.",1330128000,2,547,4.881720430107527
4990109,5,B006HH5YK6,"One hour rare LIVE Japan concert performance with subtitles. Excellent performance possibly from 1977 (Richard mentions Mr. Guder from ""seven years ago""). Sound quality is excellent and video quality is very good. I really enjoyed this show; this performance illustrates why The Carpenters sold so many records - this live show sounded just as good if not even better than their records. They are very talented individuals. It is nice to see them in their prime with such a strong, vibrant performance of 13 songs (total on this DVD). All in all, a very nice, satisfying addition to my limited Carpenters LIVE video collection. ""Sometimes"" leaves me longing for more. Thanks Carpenters for all the 'warm & fuzzy' AM radio dial memories of my youth; I was very lucky.  ;)",1329955200,8,770,4.923076923076923
4990110,4,B006HH5YK6,"I'll start off by saying I'm a big Carpenters' fan. I'll admit that I've heard their big hits (""Close to You"", ""We've Only Just Begun"" and more) a bit too often. But I like their non-hits like ""Mr. Gruder"" and ""Yesterday Once More"" and enjoy watching Karen beat the drums.

There is little live concert video of Richard and Karen available - mostly collections of the Music Videos. This concert - held in Japan - is one of the few available. A ""google"" search shows that there are bootlegs being sold by private individuals and some of the songs are on Youtube. This DVD - on the XXL label - shows the full concert but - strangely - there are no beginning or ending titles or credits. There is a menu that says ""Play All"" or ""Song Selection"". When the film starts it begins right with the first song and, after the band takes their bows, the program ends suddenly.

Also, the date in the title is obviously wrong - even though every Youtube clip of the concert gives it as 1972. The reason: When introducing the song ""Sing"", Richard says ""when we recorded this in 1973"". And it didn't hit the charts until 1973 as well.

The quality of the image is ""acceptable"" - no, it's not hi def - but it's the performances that make this fun to watch. The highlights for me were:

The aforementioned ""Mr. Gruder"" with Karen singing and playing her large drum set

The ""Oldies Medley"" - including ""Little Honda"", ""Da Doo ron Ron"", ""Leader of the Pack"" (with Karen in full Shangri-las mode), ""Johnny Angel"" (Can't remember her doing this before), ""Book of Love"" and ""Johnny B. Goode"" (where Karen REALLY bets out the drum part!)

""Sing"" - a song I've grown tired of hearing. But this time Karen sings it in Japanese with a Japanese kids chorus.

More strange things about this DVD. There are subtitles in Japanese for MOST songs. The exception is their version of the Beatle's song ""Help"" where the subtitles are in ENGLISH!

So, if you are a Carpenters fan, and haven't seen this 57-minute concert, I can recommend it. Just know about the quirkiness of the production.

I hope you found this review both helpful and entertaining.

4990135,4,B006HH5YK6,"Lets' face it: the Carpenters were a fabulous group. Had several original Classics.
This ""1972"" Concert has no surprises but that's okay with this casual but interested fan. They do the Beatles, the Monotones...the Carpenters. Karen is a babe. I'm pro-feminism since about the time of this show, so please don't chide me when I say, she makes some very sexy faces when she beats those skins.

Images aside, once again, it's her crystalline vocal chords that show that ""Close To You"" and ""Superstar (Groupie)"" will survive the next millennium. Whether or not there are still Top Pop or Middle of the Road charts.

Guess I'm showing my age..but on a Sunday afternoon I'd rather watch this than The Song Remains the Same. I think, so would Robert Plant.",1365897600,,750,4.8062015503875966
4990136,3,B006HH5YK6,I enjoyed watching the Carpenters but I thought it would have been better than what it was. I thought they would have sang more of their big hits.,1365897600,,146,4.25
4990137,2,B006HH5YK6,"I should have paid attention to the other reviewers but I just wanted to see and hear Karen.  The Japanese sub-titling and closed captioning is very distracting.  It can't be turned off and would be distracting even if it were in English.  The quality of the video taping is extremely poor.  The lighting is insufficient, the images are grainy/fuzzy and there is often distortion in the audio.  It looks like a 5th or 6th generation copy from the original.  Having said all that, I still must add that it was good to see and hear Karen in spite of the poor quality.  She was gone far too soon!",1359331200,,593,4.435185185185185
4990138,5,B006HH5YK6,"I was not a big fan back in the day when they were releasing number one hits, but being frowned upon and dismissed by fans of the more popular rock sound, harder edged arrangements and mentality. A voice like Karen Carpenter's is a thing of rare and lasting beauty though, and a voice such as that may well be the most beautiful and evocative of all musical instruments. An amazing and natural unenhanced, unembellished gift that you must be born with.  Always deeply touching, the Carpenter's are not a guilty pleasure but a timeless one.",1354060800,,539,4.673684210526316
4990139,4,B006HH5YK6,"I have to smile at all the comments about the ""sub par"" video.  ""Sexy"" horizontal video resolution, during the seventies, was 400-line...I suppose a generation acclimated to 1080p would consider this quality ""acceptable""!  And unlike film, video quality cannot be improved upon. What is especially noteworthy about this release, though, is that it's REAL performance footage. No lip-syncing!  These guys are actually playing and singing here!  The Carpenters, along with Three Dog Night and any other chart-busting pop group from the early seventies who enjoyed prime time TV airings, were notorious for lip-synching to studio recordings.  It's extremely rare to find the ""real stuff""...as has been pointed out here, Karen and Richard were sticklers for performing their staples very faithful to the records, yet the phrasing's just sufficiently different with vocals and instrument nuances to know this is not pantomined. Ditto the harmonies aren't perfectly balanced, yet still very good.  If you're expecting virtual clones of their studio hits, stay with that video that's been out all these years. This is REAL Carpenters, rendering a REAL show, unadorned with ""fixes"" and overdubs.",1350950400,,1187,5.4945054945054945
4990140,5,B006HH5YK6,This is a wonderful DVD of The Carpenters live on stage. It was great to hear and see this of a time when she was with us. I was happy to find this DVD and then find a CD of a live performance.,1349222400,,193,3.511627906976744
4990151,3,B006HH5YK6,"I really like the Carpenter's music.  This DVD has all their hit songs and more but the quality of the recording is good for when it was recorded but not good according to today's standards.  If you want to have a DVD with their good songs this one is good, just don't expect good picture and sound.",1348358400,,299,4.228070175438597
4990152,3,B006HH5YK6,"I tend to but almost anything ""Carpenters"" related so I sometimes get things that aren't so great.  This is one of those things.  It is just a rip-off from the Budokan concerts in Japan.  I would say this:  SAVE YOUR MONEY !!  There is a wonderful-actually authorized DVD from the Budokan-Japan concerts which is totally superior to this offering.  Budokan is very cool because it shows the Tokyo arrival of the Carpenters, et all.  We even get to see the 747 landing in Tokyo.
Lots of home movies from Dad Carpenter were also used in that production.  It is also a much better ""concert experience"" because it is pretty much start to finish.

This DVD just starts right off--with no intro on Rainy Days & Mondays.
The quality is very-very good--sound is very good too.  Its just an edited way down version of Budokan.  But---if you like to own everything ""Carpenters"" you probably won't be disappointed--especially if you never got an actual-authorized
Budokan DVD.",1336435200,3,965,4.823170731707317
4990153,4,B006HH5YK6,"Here's the set list for this DVD concert which was filmed in Japan during the 1970's.  Total time is 56 minutes, 59 seconds.

This is a fast moving and pleasant concert at about 57 minutes. It begins abruptly, but in general, the concert is more softer, gentler, and upbeat than what you may hear from a CD.  If you are a Carpenters fan, I think you would enjoy this concert.

The video quality is similar to a VHS tape, but it's O.K., when you consider when it was filmed.  Don't expect the audio to sound as good as a CD, but it is fine enough to enjoy.

If you are not sure if you have this concert already, please note that Karen Carpenter is wearing a blue outfit, decorated with stars and with Raggedy Ann and Raggedy Andy at the bottom of her bellbottoms.  She is also wearing a red top. .

(Perhaps, one day, Mr. Carpenter will release some concerts with better audio and video.)",1336176000,,1432,4.29368029739777
4990154,4,B006HH5YK6,"When I finished watching this I said ""I'm glad I lived long enough to experience this day."" I was too young to see the Carpenters in concert before they stopped playing, and the day Karen died, I thought I never would. Well now I finally have.

If nothing else, you have to see this for Karen's drumming on ""Johnny B. Goode"". It brings out a side of her personality I've never seen. She absolutely wails on those drums, and she's obviously having a fantastic time of it, thrashing her long hair around like a headbanger! Now I truly understand why she called herself a ""drummer who sings"".

This show probably captures Karen and Richard at the pinnacle of their careers and health. While the label says ""1972"" it must have been later, maybe 1974-1977 as other reviewers have detailed. Anyway, Karen looks great, the band sounds great, keeping true to the studio recordings but just different enough so you can tell they aren't just syncing to a tape.

Having said all that, though, I can see why Richard might be reluctant to release this footage. It seems to be a capture of a TV broadcast, and the camera directing and editing is poor. The video quality also is not up to today's expectations.

Worse, this DVD starts right in the middle of a song. I would suggest instead you try to find ""Carpenters - Live at Budokan 1974"" which looks like the exact same set list but has a couple tracks at the beginning which this DVD is missing. Even Karen's clothing is the same so I'm pretty sure it is the same show.

If you can't find that, get this! You'll never see a happier Karen than when she sits behind those drums.",1334534400,4,1616,4.482993197278912
4990155,4,B006HH5YK6,"Carpenters - In Performance 1972, great look back at the past of Karen and Richard in concert, great songs as ever. Video quality not up to today's standards but still well worth watching and enjoyable.",1334448000,,202,4.8
4990156,3,B006HH5YK6,"The video starts off very abruptly where you're partially into the first song.  It's also like you're watching a Japanese karaoke video, where there's Japanese writing running throughout the entire performance at the bottom of the screen.  The audio is very poor, mono, and the video quality is like it was dubbed from a VHS tape.  But considering that it's footage from the 70's, this is probably the best you'll get if you want to see the Carpenters perform in a live genre.  The video ends as abruptly as it started with no credits or anything else.  The reason I gave it 3 stars, is because of the good songs.  Too bad Karen's gone, because if she was still around today, she'd still be a top performer.  She'd probably have a show in Las Vegas..Celine Dion together with Karen Carpenter would have been awesome.",1330992000,2,816,4.625
4990157,5,B006HH5YK6,"Since it has been many,many moons since I saw the Carpenters perform live, I had forgotten the pure enjoyment of their music can still bring. This DVD brings back so many fond memories. Is the picture /sound quality perfect? No. HD sharpness? No. But once you start the picture, it is more than enough bang for your buck. Where else are you gonna find an hour's worth of priceless memories for this low price???",1330992000,2,411,4.5675675675675675
4990158,5,B006HH5YK6,"I was extremely skeptical about purchasing this long awaited DVD discovery of the ""CARPENTERS IN PERFORMANCE 1972"". Since I was so disappointed with the release of the last DVD ""Carpenters Live In London"". So, I thought, I would play it safe and wait a few days after its release, to read other peoples reviews. That is what prompted me to go ahead and take another chance and buy it (I am a BIG, BIG Fan of The Carpenters). But what a wonderful surprise when I opened it and played it. True, the video quality is not what this generation is used to on DVD. However, the sound quality is excellent and that makes up for it ""period"".

Karen and Richard looked great!  I never attended a concert live when they performed and this DVD, made me feel as though I had. Isn't video wonderful?  Karen left us 29 years ago and yet watching her performing live, healthy and happy makes us forget about the sadness and just enjoy the wonderful music and gift of her voice she left to the entire world.

For any Carpenters fans out there, who may not have seen this yet.  I really recommend purchasing it for your collection. I believe you won't be disappointed, and even if you are? The price is very reasonable and it won't be like you lost a mint if you were gambling at a casino!

I am amazed at the quality of the sound and video on this ""In Performance"" DVD.  It is certainly nothing like what we have available today, but given the time, I think it's pretty fantastic.  Karen's voice is as clear and perfect in pitch and tone as it was in the studio.  She appears to really be enjoying herself on the drums and I had forgotten how great she was as she kind of stepped away from playing in later years.  She appears healthy and radiant.  What a joy to see and to hear.  I sometimes get bummed out when I play a Carpenters CD or read about them as I am still miserable about her death, but I found watching this DVD to be quite a different experience.  A simpler time.  They were great.  And all these years later (42 to be exact!) I still get a thrill when I see the Logo, hear their name or hear her voice.  Timeless.",1330646400,33,1014,4.191709844559585

If you are a big Carpenters fan you need to buy this. Richard and Karen and the band they had seem to just enjoy there selfs. After all I have heard and seen on the Carpenters this was the best .

8498419,5,B006HH5YK6,"I've been looking for live performances of the Carpenters for awhile. This concert from the early 1970s in Japan is the best one I have found yet. I have been a fan since their early days and have many of their albums. But like  many, after Karen's death , I could not listen to her voice  because  it hurt too much. Last year I came across my old LPs and started buying CDs and listened to the Carpenters again. Yes it still hurts after 30 years but at the same time  I found I had missed them. And then I found the DVDs. I never had the chance to see the Carpenters live and now I had the opportunity to. So far, this DVD, Carpenters - In Performance 1972 is the best one I have seen. Karen looks so great , is healthy and in fine form. The songs on the DVD  I enjoyed the most were their version  of the Beatles ,""Help"" with Karen on the drums. She was also on the drums for ""Johnny B. Goode"" in the oldies medley. You can see  the joy in her face while she is drumming, i can see why she missed it so much later on. Karen.s version of ""End of the World"" and ""Johnny Angel"" will bring tears to your eyes, her voice is so beautiful and is no more. Karen's comic side was seen in her version of ""Leader of the Pack"" it was great to see her having fun. I also  liked seeing Karen with the Japanese children on ""Sing"". She sang this in Japanese. Karen after 30  years you are not forgotten. This DVD  shows Karen before her illness. It showed what her life should have been if not for unfortunate circunstances.  And yes her voice still brings tears. I love this DVD because it shows Karen when she was performing live and still enjoying  it. RIP",1387238400,,1645,4.10625
