This summer I will be in a charity dance competition as the instructor/dancer and i have a novice who has rhythm and is enthusiastic and not afraid.  I have learned the guys part with my daughter-in-law who dances but never ballroom and never heard of the hustle as a couples dance.  I could not have done this without your video.  You are so easy to listen to and i love the way you break down each sequence.  Thank you for saving my ""butt"". LOL",1464566400,2,527,4.188118811881188

8654560,5,B00JXZ90JA,"We were really pleased with this DVD. It exceed expectations, because the instruction was very clear and because the steps taught are ones I remember fondly from my own time as a ""disco queen"". At just over 50, my husband and I are relearning these steps. The steps covered are not only fine for ""the hustle"" but for general nightclub dancing. This is a practical, not a theatrical, DVD. You will NOT look like Travolta in Saturday night fever after learning these moves; you could dance to the 70's hits with flair but also use this instruction for modern hits of similar tempo. We plan to use our updated moves at larger clubs or on cruises.

The strength of this DVD is that the instructors provide a mental framework for how the dance moves on the floor (it is a slot dance, and the instructors clearly explain how the dancers move towards, away, or past each other) by visualizing moves as being danced on  a railroad track (albeit one that rotates). This mental imagery is very VERY useful, because the steps can be danced ""in the track"" or you move past each other by stepping off center ""on the rails"".

Secondly, the teachers go back and forth (verbally) on each step, anticipating just about everything that could possibly be confusing. Dean points out critical ""gotchas"" for the man, and Dawn points out equally important things for the lady.

The third strength is that equal attention is paid to step itself, posture, arm position, things the man does to lead, and -- most important -- how to get into the step and segue into another step. So often, teachers only ""teach the step"", and you are at a loss at how to lead it, and what things you might want to do next. Dean refers to this as amalgamations, and it is appreciated because you can put together combos pretty quickly.

With this DVD you don't need any charts or foot patterns. It helps, if you learn from this DVD and have a real-life dance instructor look at your form for a lesson or two (as we did). My husband and I took ballroom dance lesson for about 3 years, but our last lesson was about 18 years ago! So, while we are pretty quick studies on learning a dance, this DVD would be just fine for beginners.

I do not know Dean or Dawn at all - I am just a customer who bought on Amazon. But, their DVD is worth the equivalent of quite a few books.",1412467200,5,2325,4.420560747663552
