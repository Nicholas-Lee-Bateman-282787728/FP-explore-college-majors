8323826,3,B00004XQOP,"I bought this tape for my installation piece- thinking it was going to be about how Tommy became the White Ranger, but when it arrived the video cassette did not match the box it came in. It was a Light Speed Rescue Tape. Also the box was sort of worn and the tape was a little bit damaged....
Overall I'll keep it since it seems like I have no choice...but I am not pleased with my purchase. I'm a huge power rangers fan as well which is what is driving me to keep the tape.",1290211200,,475,4.010526315789473

8323828,5,B00004XQOP,"This video contains the episodes ""White Light"" parts 1 and 2, showing how Tommy, the former Green Ranger, becomes the White Ranger and leader of the Power Rangers.  This tape shows the Power Rangers at their best, before most of the series regulars were replaced and before the various incarnations of Rangers took place.  So if you're a fan of the original Rangers or if you're just curious to see how the phenomenon started, check this tape out. You're sure to have a good time.",983491200,11,480,4.635294117647059
