8597772,5,B00DU14REG,"Wladyslaw Starewicz or Ladislas Starewitch as he spelled it in France created some of the most magical puppet animation films in existence. And this 2013 release by his granddaughter in Paris reveals a few more. The four titles featuring Nina Star (Jeanne Starewitch) are L'Epouventail (The Scarecrow), La Marriage de Babylas (The Midnight Wedding), Le Voix du Roissignol (The Voice of the Nightingale) and finally, la pice de rsistance, La Reine des Papillons (The Queen of the butterflies).

These films were all made silent in the 20s and have a new score and a voice narrating the intertitles, which will help French kids and others rediscover them. And they are all obviously made for children. But they certainly go far beyond any contemporary family films in their artistry.

The Scarecrow is a curious little tale, marvelously politically incorrect (I won't give away how) and features Starewitch himself as a comic actor. But the best part for stop-motion fans are the animated devils and the scarecrow. The Marriage of Babylas is wonderfully weird in the best sense filled with plenty of strange animated puppets. The Voice of the Nightingale has been available recently on the somewhat bootleg edition done by Milestone, (they never paid for the rights) but this one is better and I noticed a little bit of extra material.

But the real reason to buy this collection is the final 25 minute opus The Queen of the Butterflies. This one gives Fetiche (The Mascot) a run for best Starewitch of all time... and that is really saying something. The film starts with a story bracketing the central dreamscape (or is it real?) featuring Nina as a street and carnival performer. But as she sleeps she is transformed into the Butterfly Queen. I don't want to give too much away. Let's just say we are treated to an astounding assortment of Starewitch's famed insect puppets, including my new all time favorite the Spider King. This film is by turns pastoral, creepy, feudal, hallucinogenic and pure enchantment. I had to feel around for my jaw on the floor.

And besides all of this you get Nina Star growing up from film to film and she is a sassy, jaunty, precious treasure. And there is also a three minute 30s era documentary on how Starewitch made and animated his puppets. Whoa, this is the goods!

Now the good news: It is subtitled in English too. AND it is region free and you can play it in North America. If you know what I'm talking about buy it now!",1381017600,,2463,4.772300469483568
