7826055,4,6302376092,"This video takes me back to 1992, when Slaughter was big, and people weren't so obssesed about rap music and songs about sad teenagers like they are today. Slaughter's ""The Wild Life Home Video"" is an underrated Slaughter gem, and if you like Slaughter, then this is a collector's item you should have(trust me- I have every Slaughter album and every Slaughter video).  This video picks up on where Slaughter's first video, ""From The Beginning""(the video that supported Slaughter's first album, ""Stick It To Ya"")left off, and if you liked Slaughter's album from 1992, ""The Wild Life"", then you will like this video.  You'll get to go in the studio with Slaughter as they were recording and prepearing for this album, and the demo versions of ""Real Love"", ""Do Ya Know"", ""Reach For The Sky"", and ""Times They Change""(the original versions, not the final versions that appeared on ""The Wild Life"" album are here, as well as the music videos for ""The Wild Life"", ""Days Gone By"", ""Out For Love"", and ""Mad About You"".  I wish the videos for ""Spend My Life"" and ""Real Love"" would have been included here also, but the videos that Slaughter included here are good, including the fact that the band shot the ""Out For Love"" video(this is where Slaughter had taken a video camera and videotaped stuff from their concerts, onstage and backstage).  I liked getting to see this video, along with the fact that I was lucky enough to see Blas Elias perform live with ""Blue Man Group"" in Las Vegas as The Blue Man Group drummer a while back ago.  Slaughter has never let me down, and until they retire, they probably never will.  I would like to thank them for the inspiration they provided me to become a musician myself.  If you like Slaughter, then you should get a copy of this video, as it is one of the best and underrated looks at a famous(but sadly, no longer popular)band.",1106352000,2,1863,4.644376899696049
