3120300,4,B0013XZ6HU,"As a former Tae Kwon Do student myself, I found this series very entertaining, and unfortunately was another History Channel series (such as Dogfights) that was replaced by other unworthy surrogates.

Both of the hosts (Bill Duff, a former college football player for the University of Tennessee) and Jason Chambers (a Jeet Kun Do expert) travel everywhere from the far reaches of Asia to even Europe (Greece, Russia) to learn various martial arts techniques and go up against an expert of their respective martial arts at the end of the show.  What was interesting about this series was the computer animations that served as a visual aide in elaborating how certain techniques are performed.

The only thing that I was slightly disappointed in was the fact that this show could have showed more basic moves while cutting back on the chatter that both hosts had with martial arts experts.  However, this is a very slight blemish (and I emphasize slight) because I realize this show was developed to provide a general outlook to those who may not have ever been exposed to the fighting styles that were aired with show (such as Eskrima which is better known by my Pilipino brethren as Arnis [pronounced are - niece]).

All in all, this was a great series and I truly recommend it for anyone with the slightest interest in martial arts.  I have a 5 month old son who I plan to enroll in a martial arts discipline by the time he reaches 4 years of age.  This show helped me revive my interest.",1218326400,4,1491,4.6679389312977095
3120301,5,B0013XZ6HU,"Human Weapon is a show that aired late last year on the History Channel and is hosted by martial arts fighter Jason Chambers and former football pro Bill Duff. They put their bodies on the line in every episode of this show and it was entertaining and informative on every style of fighting they learned. The best part of each episode was the end where one of the two hosts would take on a master in the martial art they just learned.

These chapters started with Chambers and Duff in the dojo practicing, but the missing parts left the viewers wondering what is the name of the dojo, who is the master teaching them, what is the master's background and what was the origin of the martial arts.

3120306,5,B0013XZ6HU,"This show is awesome! The formula is simple, each week, Jason and Bill go and learn about a new martial art from the people who really know. As one would expect from the History channel, not only do they learn about each fighting style, but also the history behind each style and how it fits into the history and culture of the people who developed it. As Jason and Bill learn various moves from a particular style, they show a 3-dimension demonstration of how each move works. These computer graphics really illustrate the power and skill of each martial art. Then at the end of each episode, either Bill or Jason have to go up against a real master in their art to see how well they learned. Simple, but awesome! I can't wait for the next season of Human Weapon.",1206835200,14,764,4.425531914893617
3120322,5,B0013XZ6HU,"I remember the first time I watched this show was when I was looking for places to learn martial arts and it came up in my news feed on Youtube, so I clicked on the USMC episode, or was it the pankration episode, And I remember just loving it! I'm already a fan of history, and while some of the facts may have been wrong, it was still fun to watch, and just great to see the competition at the end.

I wasn't the biggest fan of the Ninjutsu episode because of how odd the two hosts seemed in that episode, something was off I don't know what. but my favorite episode is definately Pankration.

It really inspires you to learn Martial Arts, and while you may be able to learn the basics on your own, it also inspired me to find a teacher.

I really wish they did more than one season, sure there was fight quest, but they just pretty much had the same martial arts, what I would have given to see a brand new season of this with many more different fighting styles.

Now if only I could find a school for Pankration, that would be awesome.",1434240000,,1039,4.154228855721393

The hosts Jason and Bill are very charismatic and diverse in their ability, good at explanations of the techniques they learn, they make it 'funicational' (Fun+Educational=Funicational) for the viewer with slow demonstrations of various techniques and even training from different martial arts that we could add to our own repertoire, if we got the guts.",1409961600,,858,5.006993006993007

If your buying this from someone have it sent 1st class or Priority Mail. My seller sent it Media and it took over a month ( NO KIDDING ) for it to arrive from PA to FL.

3120354,3,B0013XZ6HU,"Having just recently started training in the martial arts, I was very eager to learn more about all the popular styles.  This is a good overview of all the ones you've heard of, and a few you probably haven't.  It certainly doesn't cover every style; it would be virtually impossible to do so.

While each show culminates in a fight, most of the time is spent showing the training.  You're not likely to learn more than one or two techniques, but it's good to see the differences between the systems.",1360022400,,500,4.522222222222222
3120389,4,B0013XZ6HU,"I really enjoyed the Fight Science series, which investigated martial arts scientifically to determine how fast people were striking, if the blows would be lethal, how much force was produced, and stuff like that.  Deadliest Warrior was also entertaining, as it pitted historical adversaries against each other to see who would ""win"".  I like Human Weapon because it literally 2 people with pretty extensive fighting experience and then had them spend time getting crash courses in all these other martial arts to see what they could learn.  Surprisingly, they generally fared pretty well.  The only thing I wish is that they had fought masters, as opposed to ""champions"", since I would really like to see what the absolute best could offer.  Besides that, covers a lot of martial arts and explains how they evolved, where they came from, and what they are doing today.  Well worth watching if you are into martial arts, or even just history.",1352505600,,942,4.968152866242038

3120392,5,B0013XZ6HU,"I first watched this series on History Channel and thought it was very interesting and informative. Of course the episodes can only cover so much since each martial art has so much to offer. Nevertheless I think the series does give the viewers a taste or flavor of each martial art style. The series is not bias towards any one style, and it does not say or even hint which style is better or stronger. It is very neutral and treats each style with the same respect. Highly recommended as long as the viewer has an open mind and is willing to accept that each style is unique and different. There is so much to learn.",1306108800,,618,4.336206896551724

3120395,5,B0013XZ6HU,"A real easy concept to get your head around this one. Basically two guys go to a different country each episode to look at one of the local fighting styles. They get introduced to it and then train in that style with different proponents of it and then at the end one of them is selected to fight a local competitor. Its such a simple concept yet it allows local customs and people to be featured, the guys see local fights and some local scenery, its fun and instructional to watch the training  animated sequences help explain some of the mechanics of the moves  and in the end you get to see a sparring match. What more could you want?

Now the local fighters that are featured range from genuinely serious fighters to up and comers. A few injuries are sustained and the hosts do talk this up a bit much sometimes but their desire to learn and the respect they show the different peoples they meet and the interaction and teasing that goes on between the hosts brings this up a level.

And the fighting styles featured? Muay Thai; Eskrima; Karate; Savate; Judo; Pankration; Krav maga; Marine Corp training; MMA; Kung Fu; Sambo; Cambodian boxing; Silat; Ninjitsu; Taekwondo and there are some other bonus features across the discs.

Highly recommended.",1295481600,2,1254,4.656108597285068
3120396,5,B0013XZ6HU,"This is an AWESOME show.  Too bad it only had ONE season.  Thats the only thing lame about this series is its only One season.
Two guys who go mainly around southeast asia as well as france, U.S.A., Isreal and Russia to learn, train and later put their newly learned skills to the test in a final battle with a local champion.  Eskrima, Silat, Krav maga, MMA, Cambodian martial arts, Muy Thai kickbboxing, and USMC martial arts are highly entertaining episodes.  I love how it also goes into the history of the style that the guys are learning in each episode.  The CGI animation though is a pretty clever idea.
The USMC segment was pretty interesting and awesome.  I was highly impressed.  I love how they train in an area doused in CS gas and how the Marines condition themselves in between sparing rounds with kettle bells.  God bless the Corps!  Wish the army couldve thought of that(Army Combatives is just a rip off of BJJ).  Again I love the CGI animation that explains each move on this show.  Makes it easier to see and understand the moves being practiced.  If you're into martial arts and learning about newer ones and the history of them, this DVD set is for you.  They couldve covered Brazilian Jui Jitsu, Kempo Karate, Hap Kido and maybe even Bruce Lee's Jeet Kune Do and anything else I haven't mentioned.",1295136000,3,1320,4.56595744680851

3120409,3,B0013XZ6HU,"This is a series where two individuals travel around the world studying (or, more accurately, skimming) through various martial arts, and at the end of each episode one of them engages in a match with a practitioner of that particular discipline.  In spite of the hype, they are not fighting ""masters"" per se, just proficient practitioners or former competitors.  One is a former wrestler and football player and the other is (or was) a MMA fighter.  This series has its good and bad points.  This sort of thing has some good points in that it exposes people to many different types of martial arts, of which there are legion.  It also showcases, to a small extent,  the culture from which it sprang.  I say to a small extent because the lack of historical accuracy on some of these episodes is astounding, to say the least.  You would think on the History Channel of all places they would try to be more accurate and up to date on some of their facts.  Another thing I found some what annoying is the condescension, rudeness, and sometimes outright arrogance of the testosterone driven hosts, who seem, in many cases, to act like they completely understand to the fullest degree what they are being taught after only a few hours instruction.  The outright banality of this is usually evident at the end of each show when one of them gets into a match with some one who actually does know what they are doing in that particular discipline, and then one or both of them usually makes excuses why they didn't do better.  While most of these episodes do have their good moments, personally I found the episodes on Marine Corps martial arts and MMA to be the biggest wastes of film in the entire series.  The krav maga episodes was marred by the poor attitude of many of the instructors, who seemed, to me, to act like bloodthirsty thugs rather than martial arts instructors.  I'm giving this a three because it does showcase many different martial arts and would be of interest to anyone interested in the martial arts in general, but it is not something I intend to watch on a regular basis; I would more or less use it as a reference for very basic information on some of the martial arts presented.",1275091200,6,2198,4.576530612244898
3120410,5,B0013XZ6HU,"This should be a part of everyone's collection. You learn a little about each countries culture, art, and some fighting techniques for the ring and street. The two hosts grow on each other each episode, and their interaction is both fun and frustrating. But unlike most TV they do grow and learn and work together. Great stuff.

3120417,4,B0013XZ6HU,"Human Weapon is a show that appeared on the History Channel during 2007. This dvd set contains all of the first season episodes and a few extras. The show predated the Discovery Channel's Fight Quest by a few months. Since comparisons will be inevitable, I will first comment on this dvd set in particular and then comment on the show itself.

The Human Weapon complete dvd set came with 4 dvds. There are some extras on the disks along with the usual chapter surfing through each of the episodes. You can chose which episode per disk you want to view first. The quality of the picture is about the same as it was when the show aired on HC. In general, I liked what was done with the dvd set and thought ""this is what the Discovery Channel should have done with their Fight Quest dvd set"".

Now, to the show itself. In my opinion, this show is not quite as entertaining as Fight Quest. Although both shows are good and follow a similar format, the differences in Human Weapon are what make it a little less than great. Both hosts in Human Weapon seem more rehearsed and staged. Also, only 1 host in Human Weapon must participate in competitive sparring by the end of each martial art exposure, whereas in Fight Quest the 2 hosts both had to compete at the end of their quests. Human Weapon had more explanation about the moves and the arts themselves than Fight Quest, which is something I liked better about Human Weapon. However, the fighting seemed less intense and real than the fights in Fight Quest. Also, partly because Human Weapon had more episodes, there are some arts that are different or are displayed in this show and not in Fight Quest. For example, Fight Quest contains episodes focused on Brazilian jiu-jitsu and Korean hapkido, which are not found in Human Weapon. Both shows contain episodes on karate, French savate, Chinese kung fu, and Israeli krav maga.

Trivia: Jimmy Smith from Fight Quest beat Jason Chambers of Human Weapon in a mixed martial arts fight in California, on May 12, 2006 according to Chambers' entry on wikipedia.

Overall, I recommend watching Human Weapon if you are into martial arts or just a little interested.  This dvd set is better than Fight Quest's but the show itself was not quite as good as FQ.",1229299200,2,2248,4.596009975062344

These chapters started with Chambers and Duff in the dojo practicing, but the missing parts left the viewers wondering what is the name of the dojo, who is the master teaching them, what is the master's background and what was the origin of the martial arts.

3354803,5,B0013XZ6HU,"This show is awesome! The formula is simple, each week, Jason and Bill go and learn about a new martial art from the people who really know. As one would expect from the History channel, not only do they learn about each fighting style, but also the history behind each style and how it fits into the history and culture of the people who developed it. As Jason and Bill learn various moves from a particular style, they show a 3-dimension demonstration of how each move works. These computer graphics really illustrate the power and skill of each martial art. Then at the end of each episode, either Bill or Jason have to go up against a real master in their art to see how well they learned. Simple, but awesome!

3354819,5,B0013XZ6HU,"I remember the first time I watched this show was when I was looking for places to learn martial arts and it came up in my news feed on Youtube, so I clicked on the USMC episode, or was it the pankration episode, And I remember just loving it! I'm already a fan of history, and while some of the facts may have been wrong, it was still fun to watch, and just great to see the competition at the end.

I wasn't the biggest fan of the Ninjutsu episode because of how odd the two hosts seemed in that episode, something was off I don't know what. but my favorite episode is definately Pankration.

It really inspires you to learn Martial Arts, and while you may be able to learn the basics on your own, it also inspired me to find a teacher.

I really wish they did more than one season, sure there was fight quest, but they just pretty much had the same martial arts, what I would have given to see a brand new season of this with many more different fighting styles.

Now if only I could find a school for Pankration, that would be awesome.",1434240000,,1039,4.154228855721393

The hosts Jason and Bill are very charismatic and diverse in their ability, good at explanations of the techniques they learn, they make it 'funicational' (Fun+Educational=Funicational) for the viewer with slow demonstrations of various techniques and even training from different martial arts that we could add to our own repertoire, if we got the guts.",1409961600,,858,5.006993006993007

This is a good overview of all the ones you've heard of, and a few you probably haven't.  It certainly doesn't cover every style; it would be virtually impossible to do so.

While each show culminates in a fight, most of the time is spent showing the training.  You're not likely to learn more than one or two techniques, but it's good to see the differences between the systems.",1360022400,,500,4.522222222222222

Deadliest Warrior was also entertaining, as it pitted historical adversaries against each other to see who would ""win"".  I like Human Weapon because it literally 2 people with pretty extensive fighting experience and then had them spend time getting crash courses in all these other martial arts to see what they could learn.  Surprisingly, they generally fared pretty well.  The only thing I wish is that they had fought masters, as opposed to ""champions"", since I would really like to see what the absolute best could offer.  Besides that, covers a lot of martial arts and explains how they evolved, where they came from, and what they are doing today.

3354889,5,B0013XZ6HU,"I first watched this series on History Channel and thought it was very interesting and informative. Of course the episodes can only cover so much since each martial art has so much to offer. Nevertheless I think the series does give the viewers a taste or flavor of each martial art style. The series is not bias towards any one style, and it does not say or even hint which style is better or stronger. It is very neutral and treats each style with the same respect. Highly recommended as long as the viewer has an open mind and is willing to accept that each style is unique and different. There is so much to learn.",1306108800,,618,4.336206896551724

3354892,5,B0013XZ6HU,"A real easy concept to get your head around this one. Basically two guys go to a different country each episode to look at one of the local fighting styles. They get introduced to it and then train in that style with different proponents of it and then at the end one of them is selected to fight a local competitor. Its such a simple concept yet it allows local customs and people to be featured, the guys see local fights and some local scenery, its fun and instructional to watch the training  animated sequences help explain some of the mechanics of the moves  and in the end you get to see a sparring match. What more could you want?

Now the local fighters that are featured range from genuinely serious fighters to up and comers. A few injuries are sustained and the hosts do talk this up a bit much sometimes but their desire to learn and the respect they show the different peoples they meet and the interaction and teasing that goes on between the hosts brings this up a level.

And the fighting styles featured? Muay Thai; Eskrima; Karate; Savate; Judo; Pankration; Krav maga; Marine Corp training; MMA; Kung Fu; Sambo; Cambodian boxing; Silat; Ninjitsu; Taekwondo and there are some other bonus features across the discs.

Highly recommended.",1295481600,2,1254,4.656108597285068
3354893,5,B0013XZ6HU,"This is an AWESOME show.  Too bad it only had ONE season.  Thats the only thing lame about this series is its only One season.
Two guys who go mainly around southeast asia as well as france, U.S.A., Isreal and Russia to learn, train and later put their newly learned skills to the test in a final battle with a local champion.  Eskrima, Silat, Krav maga, MMA, Cambodian martial arts, Muy Thai kickbboxing, and USMC martial arts are highly entertaining episodes.  I love how it also goes into the history of the style that the guys are learning in each episode.  The CGI animation though is a pretty clever idea.
The USMC segment was pretty interesting and awesome.  I was highly impressed.  I love how they train in an area doused in CS gas and how the Marines condition themselves in between sparing rounds with kettle bells.  God bless the Corps!  Wish the army couldve thought of that(Army Combatives is just a rip off of BJJ).  Again I love the CGI animation that explains each move on this show.  Makes it easier to see and understand the moves being practiced.  If you're into martial arts and learning about newer ones and the history of them, this DVD set is for you.  They couldve covered Brazilian Jui Jitsu, Kempo Karate, Hap Kido and maybe even Bruce Lee's Jeet Kune Do and anything else I haven't mentioned.",1295136000,3,1320,4.56595744680851

3354906,3,B0013XZ6HU,"This is a series where two individuals travel around the world studying (or, more accurately, skimming) through various martial arts, and at the end of each episode one of them engages in a match with a practitioner of that particular discipline.  In spite of the hype, they are not fighting ""masters"" per se, just proficient practitioners or former competitors.  One is a former wrestler and football player and the other is (or was) a MMA fighter.  This series has its good and bad points.  This sort of thing has some good points in that it exposes people to many different types of martial arts, of which there are legion.  It also showcases, to a small extent,  the culture from which it sprang.  I say to a small extent because the lack of historical accuracy on some of these episodes is astounding, to say the least.  You would think on the History Channel of all places they would try to be more accurate and up to date on some of their facts.  Another thing I found some what annoying is the condescension, rudeness, and sometimes outright arrogance of the testosterone driven hosts, who seem, in many cases, to act like they completely understand to the fullest degree what they are being taught after only a few hours instruction.  The outright banality of this is usually evident at the end of each show when one of them gets into a match with some one who actually does know what they are doing in that particular discipline, and then one or both of them usually makes excuses why they didn't do better.  While most of these episodes do have their good moments, personally I found the episodes on Marine Corps martial arts and MMA to be the biggest wastes of film in the entire series.  The krav maga episodes was marred by the poor attitude of many of the instructors, who seemed, to me, to act like bloodthirsty thugs rather than martial arts instructors.  I'm giving this a three because it does showcase many different martial arts and would be of interest to anyone interested in the martial arts in general, but it is not something I intend to watch on a regular basis; I would more or less use it as a reference for very basic information on some of the martial arts presented.",1275091200,6,2198,4.576530612244898

3354914,4,B0013XZ6HU,"Human Weapon is a show that appeared on the History Channel during 2007. This dvd set contains all of the first season episodes and a few extras. The show predated the Discovery Channel's Fight Quest by a few months. Since comparisons will be inevitable, I will first comment on this dvd set in particular and then comment on the show itself.

The Human Weapon complete dvd set came with 4 dvds. There are some extras on the disks along with the usual chapter surfing through each of the episodes. You can chose which episode per disk you want to view first. The quality of the picture is about the same as it was when the show aired on HC. In general, I liked what was done with the dvd set and thought ""this is what the Discovery Channel should have done with their Fight Quest dvd set"".

Now, to the show itself. In my opinion, this show is not quite as entertaining as Fight Quest. Although both shows are good and follow a similar format, the differences in Human Weapon are what make it a little less than great. Both hosts in Human Weapon seem more rehearsed and staged. Also, only 1 host in Human Weapon must participate in competitive sparring by the end of each martial art exposure, whereas in Fight Quest the 2 hosts both had to compete at the end of their quests. Human Weapon had more explanation about the moves and the arts themselves than Fight Quest, which is something I liked better about Human Weapon. However, the fighting seemed less intense and real than the fights in Fight Quest. Also, partly because Human Weapon had more episodes, there are some arts that are different or are displayed in this show and not in Fight Quest. For example, Fight Quest contains episodes focused on Brazilian jiu-jitsu and Korean hapkido, which are not found in Human Weapon. Both shows contain episodes on karate, French savate, Chinese kung fu, and Israeli krav maga.

Trivia: Jimmy Smith from Fight Quest beat Jason Chambers of Human Weapon in a mixed martial arts fight in California, on May 12, 2006 according to Chambers' entry on wikipedia.

Overall, I recommend watching Human Weapon if you are into martial arts or just a little interested.  This dvd set is better than Fight Quest's but the show itself was not quite as good as FQ.",1229299200,2,2248,4.596009975062344
