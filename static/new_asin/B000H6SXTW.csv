2630176,3,B000H6SXTW,Plays great in my Blu Ray player.  The movie itself is just OK.  I've seen better and worst!!!!,1237507200,2,95,4.222222222222222
2630177,3,B000H6SXTW,"A combination of ""V"", Alien, Soylent Green, and Invasion of the Body Snatchers (I'm sure I missed a couple!)just shows that there is nothing new in Hollywood.  The acting is...well, okey.  However, the main character (Gil Bellows) is just plain sloooow.  I think if it were me, I would get a little more excited!  Still, all in all, a worthy flick to watch on a slow day.",1230336000,2,371,4.492537313432836
2630178,4,B000H6SXTW,"This movie is definitely for Sci-fi fans. It is more on the subdued side as opposed to the high octane type, like 'Alien'. However, it is a good story.
Fairly formula type: the earth is being invaded by bugs using human skins to blend in in order to get a substance to help their 'race' survive. Humans are expendable.
I gave this four stars because it could have easily been shorter. Coming in close to 4 hours with a low key plot... you really have to like this genre to sit through it. But I do like this genre, still think it could have been shorter though.
Definitely a family type, low key, not much in the way of violence or strong language or sexual situations. Worth a watch.",1226534400,4,684,4.310077519379845
2630179,1,B000H6SXTW,"it has to be one of the worse movies i have ever seen, even on blu-ray, complete waste of money",1217462400,2,95,3.8
2630180,3,B000H6SXTW,"This is the kind of movie that if you have absolutely nothing better to do, watch it.  Acting was less than stellar, video quality was not blu-ray worthy and the story was ""been there, done that.""  I gave it 3 stars because it passed the time and made me want to know what happened next.  I would not recommend purchasing this movie, however, its not a complete waste of time to watch.",1217376000,17,385,4.319444444444445
2630181,4,B000H6SXTW,"A surprisingly good film, Final Days of Planet Earth brings to the screen the story of an unlikely group of people that have banded together in an effort to uncover a plot that could spell the end of human civilization, as we know it.
An archaeologist leads a motley crew of a band who all share something in common: they've all been chosen to become hosts or fertilizer in the service of some very desperate and rather anxious alien life forms...
Daryl Hannah being the only well known of the actors disappoints with her performance which seems forced and unnatural, while the rest of the cast carry out their performances pretty well (though nothing great) and establish likable characters.
Although it was a pleasure to see the lovely Daryl Hannah again, good acting on her part and a bit of exposure would have been just right...
The film doesn't start off that strong, but instead picks up about 20 minutes into the movie.  Moreover, in the beginning it's too abstract and difficult to follow, but most of it falls into place soon enough.  One thing we're never told is how and why Commander Phillips has such an effect on the baddies...
In short, the setting, the music and the acting are pretty good, the action/special effects are just average, the plot is interesting, while the dialogues are rather poor.
In a nutshell, it's probably not a movie you would want to add to your collection, but it will provide for an evening's entertainment, and that's about it.  3.5 Stars",1186790400,,1481,4.710424710424711
2630182,3,B000H6SXTW,"I rarely buy a movie I haven't seen, but I bought this thinking that with Daryl Hannah for decoration and Gil Bellows as the lead, it had to be worth $4.99.  At the end of part I was thinking ""Hey, not bad!"", but part II was terrible acting and poor plotting.  What finally made it ""bad"" for me was the ""aliens in disguise"" business.  At first they seemed to be using mind control, but by the end we see Hannah's character jump out of her rubber suit, instantly becoming several sizes too big to have ever been inside the suit.  Bellows looked really silly holding Hannah's empty ""human suit"" and staring up at the giant monster. sigh.  At least he didn't actually have sex with her (but he came close!).

Oh, well.  The kids will enjoy it.",1186617600,3,740,4.357664233576642
2630183,2,B000H6SXTW,"if you are sci-fi movies addict and just want to gobble up anything related to this genre no matter what, then go ahead. otherwise, don't do it. this is such a ridiculous movie with outlandish scenario. i've tried so hard to sit it thru but finally decided to bail out and went where the toilet bowl located, never thought going back and tried it again.",1166572800,8,353,4.446153846153846
2630184,3,B000H6SXTW,"although a made for cable film,this ones worth a look. A colony of Praying Mantis from another universe plan on using  the human race for food. Seems that the insects home planet ran out of food they needed to survive. They use human skin to cover themselves to look like normal humans, are the top officials of city hall as they ""prosses"" humans to make a liquid they can suck up to nurish their body's. Sort of a insects from outer space establishing a ""Star Bucks"" serving a human liquified delights.",1164758400,21,503,4.527472527472527
8137193,5,B000H6SXTW,"Very campy.  Love these movies.  Goofy enough for me, just enough taking themselves seriously for the others!",1486944000,,109,5.352941176470588
8137194,5,B000H6SXTW,I'm a big Science Fiction Series fan. I had to see this movie so I bought it and at a great price,1399593600,,97,3.4545454545454546
8137195,4,B000H6SXTW,if you like these type of movies you shoul enjoy this also especally the price movie ply exellant and clear,1357776000,,107,4.4
8137196,1,B000H6SXTW,"Nothing could save this turkey.  The acting is mechanical and the story has so many holes in it, it could pass for swiss cheeze.  It is a total waste of time and money.",1339804800,,168,4.0606060606060606
8137197,3,B000H6SXTW,"This is an extended (170 minutes) two-parter that provides a moderate amount of entertainment in the alien's take over the world category. The movie moves along at a reasonable pace and held my attention the whole time. The leads do presentable jobs except for Daryl Hannah who was not in her best form for this one. She came across with a rather perfunctory performance which didn't measure up to what she has, on other occasions, done in other films.

This one is pretty much for the dedicated fan but at the price being offered it's a pretty good deal for a rainy afternoon and beats most of what can be found on broadcast TV. I'll probably watch it again in a year or two on another rainy afternoon.",1330387200,,703,4.4921875
8137198,3,B000H6SXTW,"I have to admit the film was silly, and had been done better previously, but I found myself watching with some interest and amusement. Gil Bellows saves the film from being a total washout. He plays a good hero. Daryl Hannah has often been criticized, and if this was her comeback, it didn't work. I really loved her in ""Splash"" and ""Steel Magnolias"". She's not convincing as a mean person. Campbell Scott played crazy, and he was okay in a difficult role. Not bad, really, but it will satisfy those who enjoy movies ""so bad, they're good"". I was entertained.",1318982400,,559,4.6
8137199,2,B000H6SXTW,"This is an odd movie, too long by half; it reminded me of a lot of other movies I've seen along similar plotlines.  It's your typical BIG BUGS want to take over the world scenario.  Their reasons for doing so were lack of food on their home world and that they knew they could manage the natural resources of Earth better than we have.  Of course, by resources they mean people (bred for food.  I guess that would make us aphids?).
With a less than auspicious beginning, it's no wonder this epic isn't more highly regarded.  They leisurely/briefly introduced a clump of characters then abruptly discarded them; amiably peeking back in at their lives at various points from time to time.  There was no hurry, no intrigue, no suspense to start things out.  They just showed people going about their business until eventually they brought them together and then the action finally began (too late to satisfy me).  This movie is so low-key, so lackadaisical; one wonders why they even bothered to thwart the plans of the superior bug race.  Then again, what else did they have to do; most of the characters were out of jobs at that point.
At least this movie was consistent throughout.  The characters were all more or less stupid, the only reason they got away with so many things was because they could count on everyone else being equally stupid.  A lot of the decisions made didn't make sense, starting with the astronaut the bugs saved because they were afraid of him/his blood.  They could have easily solved that by jettisoning him in space in the first place.  I spent a great deal of time questioning the motives of every action/choice depicted; it's as if they filmed the rough draft without vetting its likelihood or logic behind what they were making these people do.  It also didn't help that the hero (Gil Bellows) was basically incompetent (not to mention unlikable).  As for the astronaut who started the whole thing, Campbell Scott might as well have not been in this movie, he was rarely used and of that, hardly anything one would brag about.  Then there's the bug queen.  Daryl Hannah hasn't exactly had a sterling career thus far so I doubt that appearing in this one did irrevocable harm to her legacy.  I suppose that if everyone involved tried just a little harder this might have been okay.  As it is......eh.

I'm still trying to figure out how those gigantic bugs fit inside a person without the pointy bits sticking out!",1311897600,,2444,4.679156908665106
8137200,1,B000H6SXTW,"O.K. i am not going to mention how lame this movie was, and i am a fan of b-flicks.
However, i must point out the issue with the Blu-ray disk as there are audio problems with this release.
BOTH the Dolby and DTS tracks have the same issue with the sound field. The audio surround mix comes from the FRONT LEFT, CENTRE, and RIGHT REAR, the front right and rear left are silent, who the heck mixed this sound track? what a mess up, not to mention it was REALLY annoying hearing all the right front audio coming from the right rear speaker.
But wait folks!! it gets better!! even the stereo 2.0 track is messed up but with a diff'rent problem, in the 2.0 track there is a slight echo with the ambient sounds (like a car driving by) but the voices don't have the echo but come from a combo of the front left and centre channel.

buyer beware!!!",1273363200,,840,4.217391304347826
8137201,1,B000H6SXTW,"Strange disappearances and cover-ups proliferate in a Northern waterfront town, and reporter Jake Roth (John Cassini) shares information with cynical archaeologist Lloyd Walker (Gil Bellows) after his dig site is ruled off limits by city official Korshaft (Serge Houde). Lloyd discovers strange mounds of organic material in an underground chamber near city hall, and finds a friend in ex-astronaut Liz Quinlan (Daryl Hannah), an attractive city troubleshooter who also suggests that they pool resources------blahblahblah.

you get the point!  its not so good!  but better then watching  paint dry---:p",1261785600,,602,5.806818181818182
8137202,2,B000H6SXTW,"Not the worst movie ever but bad script and plot line.

SPOILER - My favorite stupid plot error; Hey we need weapons so they buy machetes, then kill four cops in full SWAT gear but don't bother to  take any of their weapons.  Earlier Gil Bellows character knocks a cop out and steals his full uniform, including gun and it goes missing as soon as he gets back in the exterminator's van.",1253404800,,386,4.333333333333333
