3448973,5,B001AI776G,this show is amazing and i have been waiting anxiously for the 3rd season on dvd!,1215475200,2,81,4.125
3448974,4,B001AI776G,"i have to say i was leery about season three when i heard mandy patinkin was leaving. but my fears were for nothing. season three is probably my favorite yet. it has many strong episodes, tries new things (true night, one of my favorites) and gives us a peek into garcia's life in several riveting episodes.

i don't care about rossi the way i cared about gideon, but he's a good character and i'm glad he's not a carbon copy of jason. the team works together very well and season three shows that cm is more of an ensemble show now...which i very much enjoy.

as usual, cm has excellent supporting actors in every episode, riveting story lines, and makes fantastic use of background music choices. i can't wait to buy season three, and i'm looking forward to season 4. season three is especially worthwhile to see how much doctor spencer reid has changed and grown from season one. highly recommended.

imo, the best season 3 eps are:

in birth and death
scared to death
7 seconds
true night
lucky
penelope
third life
damage
higher power
elephant's memory
tabula rasa",1213142400,59,1068,4.605263157894737

3449006,5,B001AI776G,The first episode of the season is great even tho gideon leaves soon after. This is an incredibly well cast show with likeable characters all the way around...but gideon was the best. I wasn't sure the show could continue to be great without him but even tho i miss him it is still wonderful. Soon after he leaves they bring in rossi to replace him. Hes no gideon but is def likeable too in a dif way. There are many great episodes this season but the best was prob elephants memory. It has an unsub that u actually feel some sympathy for which is rare on this show. Reid feels sympathy for him too and understands him and the way he interacts with him is interesting. It is also set to a bunch of johnny cash music which is cool. The heat was also pretty good. Hotches life also falls apart this season and it ends with some crazy stuff happening w him but i won't spoiler anything here. Also jj has some new things goin on in her personal life which r pretty cool. We r continueing to learn more about the characters while still getting to c all the interesting work they do in the fbi and all of the crazy cases and weirdo unsubs that made us fall in love w the show. I miss gideon in every episode. It feels almost like a whole other show without him but with characters as strong as reid hotch an morgan esp...the show continues to b absolutely amazing.,1493683200,,1358,4.2471042471042475

3449014,4,B001AI776G,"Some of this is complete nonsense, but anything Garcia does, seems like fantasy land.  I just don't buy her character, or half of anything they do with computers.  Talk about blowing smoke.  However, it is still enjoyable, and some of the best episodes came from season 3 for me (its as far as I've got).  I really liked episode 11, with the graphic artist.

Reid deals with his drug problem. Garcia gets shot and has to deal with an angel of death cop, whose cases she flagged. and JJ finally admits to have been seeing William Montane for the past year and the last episode she tells him she's pregnant. this season we also see that Hotch is human after all, when his wife decides to leave him because she can no longer take him doing this job.",1421280000,,773,4.16

3449275,5,B001AI776G,"I would not bore you with how disturbing this show is, if you read my other reviews of s1 and s2, you know that already. The fact that this stuff is out there and really happening just adds to the horror of it all. Criminal Minds S3 does not disappoint in any way at all. It continues where season two left off.

 ***Spoiler Alert***

In the aftermath of Gideon's friend from college's murder at the hands of Frank, Gideon has a ""What does it all mean?"" crisis and leaves the series. Hodge is still under scrutiny from his higher up. And, Reid is still addicted to the drugs forced into his veins by the unsub in season 2. What happens next? You will have to watch to find out. I can tell you it's going to be a great though disturbing ride, but well worth every minute.

***Spoiler Alert Over***

I would highly recommend this season to anyone who has seen any of season 1 or 2 of this mind blowing series. But, please first watch the first two seasons.

reruns of Criminal Minds and a couple of my other favorite TV programs that cost me over $70/month.  Now I can watch an entire season or two for half that amount.

I have mentioned this before; that I like ensemble productions with interesting, likeable characters; that I appreciate good writing and occasional comedy relief interspersed with reasonably realistic situations; and above all, really talented actors who don't make you think they're acting.  The addition of Joe Mantegna in the third series, in my opinion, adds weight, gravitas (don't you love that word?) and believability and moves the whole production up a notch into a more classic category.",1396396800,,523,5.365853658536586

3449378,5,B001AI776G,I love the Criminal Minds series so I might be a fanboy. But with the introduction of new characters this series did not miss a beat and in many cases it got better. If crime dramas and your not watching this series then for you I feel sorry. That being said Crimial Minds touches on some pretty sick plots revoling around americas worst serial killers and some of the topics are not for the weak of stomach. Not too gory but the will be blood.,1383523200,,444,4.235294117647059

When it first started airing, I had issues accepting David Rossi (played by Joe Mantegna) as part of the new unit. (I don't have those feelings anymore, of course!) What I enjoyed most was the development of the characters that occurred over the season - from the (re-)introduction of Rossi, to Reid's problems with addiction, and Morgan's crisis of faith. One of the best episodes from this season was ""Penelope,"" where viewers are given more insight into our favorite computer analyst, Garcia. The ""unsubs"" from this season are also particularly memorable.

Thank God they got rid of Lola Glaudini-she couldn't act & her character was always this weak,whiney annoying untrained young girl, not a trained professional agent. I was also so-o-o glad that Mandy Patankkn left after season 2. He was very annoying. It seemed he had to be in every scene & that he gave all the orders,with the other characters only bit players. At least Season 3, all the actors get to shine & all have episodes they are strong in. The best of all of them for me is, of course,Thomas Gibson's Aaron Hotchner!!!His character is so strong,such a leader,yet so emotional under the surface. The team only gets better with Joe Mantegna,what a great choice to join the group. Strong himself, yet amusing & he doesn't try to dominate everyone. The charisma between the whole cast is so obvious, along with the great scripts, that is why the ratings have soared the past few seasons! Keep going on for a long time, Criminal Minds!!Seasons 4 & 5 have only gotten better!! Also keep going-Thomas Gibson, handsomest actor on TB today!!",1274918400,2,1109,4.663265306122449

3449556,5,B001AI776G,"CRIMINAL MINDS had established itself as a huge ratings hit. Over the first 2 seasons it had developed characters to care about who worked for the Behavioral Analysis Unit (BAU) of the FBI. It broke the mold from other nighttime crime shows and was very unique in that it not only showed how the minds of serial killers and criminals worked but also how the FBI used profiling and other skills to unearth the pattern of each killer they were investigating. Season 2 saw some slight cast changes from season 1 but no one on the show saw what was coming at the beginning of season 3.

To view the season as an entity you see a series grow even further than it had before. You see what it means for a cast to truly work together and have each member be strong. The only thing noticable is the shortage of episodes and this is due to the writers strike and this was out of the shows hands. They still managed to come up with 20 mezmerizing episodes. But anyone who loved this show for the first two seasons saw Mandy Patinkin as the star and he is now gone. The writers and producers had to make it so that the viewers saw none of the drama that was going on behind the camera and what we get is a seamless story line introducing Joe Mantegnana who manages to bring an even stronger presence without eclipsing Patinkin. And the viewer can see the cast coming together. Episodes are given to each cast member providing the audience the unique opportunity to aquire knowledge of their personal lives which is often lost with such shows. It makes sense that it works so well on CRIMINAL MINDS for the storylines are often horrific and reach the fine line of what can be shown on televison. We get to see how the job and the cases effect the agents which helps ease the intensity for us the viewers.

I enjoy much nighttime television but don't purchase much for posterity. I find the quality in writing, acting and producing to be above reproach on CRIMINAL MINDS. The plots are inventive, engrossing and violence always serves a purpose. It is used in a realistic way and nver crosses the line. It gets intense but the subject here is very intense. The show also manages to inject quips of humour but bottom line is this is a show that continues to pull the viewer in and only gets better with season 3. True crime is a subject of huge popularity and this show follows in the same vein. If you are new to this superb series now as good a time as any to introduce yourself to one of tv's best.",1265414400,12,2486,4.355603448275862

3449559,4,B001AI776G,"While I understood very well why Mandy Patinkin had to leave and felt the writers did a great job in writing Jason Gideon's departure, I feel the show took a step down in losing such an amazing character and actor.  The Jason Gideon character gave a very important level of balance to a show that is essentially about a hard look at the coldest and darkest side of humanity.  Jason Gideon was a very believable character that even with so many years of being in the field and considered to be the very top in the field, still felt pain and compassion not only for the victims he worked tirelessly to save from that dark side but also for his team and in helping them through their fears and susceptabilities.  Mandy Patinkin played that role with grace and class showing the vulnerabilities of the character with a very human light.  The new character - Rossi has a harder edge - much like you would expect from a veteran but there's less to like and to identify with. Joe Mantegna does a wonderful job of making that character different from the previous lead and giving the other regular characters a chance to develop their human sides.  The third and fourth seasons, were very good seasons (and in fact I first got hooked by an episode in the fourth season), but its definitely lost a bit of balance without Jason Gideon/Mandy Patinkin there.",1255219200,5,1346,4.568464730290456
3449560,4,B001AI776G,"There were a considerable amount of good and great episodes this season! I like most was kind of worried about Criminal Minds without Jason Gideon (writing him out could have been done a bit better. I personally think the events of the Season 2 Finale were enough to make anyone quit their job). I admit the episodes leading up to Joe Mantegna's appearance seemed to be just biding their time until a new guy stepped in but I like his character. The Season Finale is awesome as if the two-parter in which a team member gets shot. It seems as if the 1st Season was to have you qualify the BAU Crew, the 2nd was to show you that they are all human characters with the same worries, love and flaws as you and I and the 3rd, is to show that profiling doesn't solve everything and sometimes it goes wrong. I particularly liked how the end of the Season Opener leaves you in doubt about whether the suspect arrested was really the Un-Sub or not.

  i also have to give the shows writers total credit it is the most brilliant writing on the show. that is the heart of criminal minds is that the stories are so intense and chilling you can't help but to watch the entire show at the end to see what happens.
  i love the quotes they use on the show to describe what will happen in their adventures....like one quote i love is that a sad soul is more deadlier and quicker to kill you than a germ. that quote was use when they were doing a columbine like episode where dr. reid try to save a school shooter from killing anymore people.
  if you want to a brilliant show to watch this is the one for you. i will be honest don't spend so much money on this show unless it goes down to about 9.99 or under. right now its too expensive so if you want to save money try to tape these shows on tv and if you cant wait till the price lowers.",1242864000,,1205,4.02092050209205

I miss the first guy that was on it but the other is fine. My fav character is Spencer. I wish I had a friend like him he is funny. And I love Garcia. Can't wait for Season 4 to buy.

The use of flashbacks (where they picture what the criminal might have done is very effective (though I was not a huge fan of them).  The show also has many moments where a split decision can mean life or death, so it keeps you on the edge of your seat.

3449588,5,B001AI776G,"Ever hear of horrible crime commited and wonder ""What were they thinking"", or ""What could bring a person to do such a thing?!""....well this show answers those questions in a very slick, very captivating way.  The characters are believable as they go about the business of not only solving the crime, but explaining, however brutal, WHY it happened.  This show is not for the timid or easily shocked nor is it for the very young.  The whole psychology behind some of the worst crimes against humanity is played out in every episode in not so much a visually graphic way, but moreso in the dialog and even more in what is not said, as your mind puts together the string of events that led up to the ""unsub"" as they are called in the show, meaning the unknown subject that did the horrible deed.  Just as CSI goes into the physical science of solving crimes, this show goes into the psychology of solving crimes.  What could make a person do such a thing? Watch this show and find out.
Oh, and I agree, I too miss Mandy!  Joe Mantegna is ""ok""...but I just don't find myself all that interested in what he has to say (in this show). He just seems too stuffy and blah.  Everyone else though...their characters keep getting better and better!!",1228953600,2,1237,4.495535714285714
3449589,5,B001AI776G,"Criminal Minds is the best series of it,s genre being made today. I look eagerly to all of the new series and have watched the first three series several times each and never tire of the shows. The characters are very diverse and are all cast very well to the personalities they portray, from the seemingly stuffed shirt of Hotchner, with a heart under that stuffed shirt, to the the rather geeky, but utterly loverble Spencer. I absolutely love Garcia, who provides some lightness into the seemingly chaotic world she deals with daily. The rest Of the cast complete a superb ensemble of characters who mesh together superbly. Like a lot of other people, I was dismayed when the characters of Gideon and Elle left the show, but however the two actors who replaced them have filled their shoes more than adequately. I hope this show gives it,s fans many, many more of the same superb quality entertainment. Luv it, Lee.",1228694400,,918,4.708074534161491
3449590,4,B001AI776G,"I was a late comer to the series, but after watching reruns on TiVo of the show last year, I asked for the first two seasons for Christmas last year and when the third season came out, I ordered it right away. I really like the series and think the shows are well written and acted. My only complaint with the third season was how short it was, but that wasn't the show's fault.",1227398400,,378,4.121621621621622
3449591,5,B001AI776G,As in past years this show always delivers.  It survived the leaving of the main star with class.  The addition of the character of Rossi just made the show better.  It was a must have for my collection.,1226448000,,203,4.2894736842105265
3449592,5,B001AI776G,"I enjoyed very much the first two seasons. But when I read that Mandy Patinkin had left the show I was disappointed and thought that was the end of Criminal Minds. I was so wrong! And don't get me wrong, he was a great asset being the character they most turned to for advise in all areas of the psyque. Joe Mantegna is more likable -sorry Mandy- and though he was brought to the show almost abruptly, they show you how he adapts gradually to everybody and the new way things are done at the BAU since he had been part of it when it began. Throughout the season, Joe Mantegna integrates the team like a piece of a puzzle that didn't quite fit was removed and placed by the perfect one, and now I see that the show will not only survive it's leading character but will do better with the new one.

Now, the plot. Unfortunately, there are so many sick in this world that they will never run out of new ideas for a show. Every episode is good, has new twists, and some episodes are even better that what we would sometimes expect; you are guessing who is going to be the bad guy and how they are going to figure out, by his/her personality or behavior, who committed this or that murder. It's just so wonderfully made that sometimes I think I have a bit of a psychologist in me!

It never gets boring and even though it is about solving mostly murders, I always finish watching with a sense of satisfaction.

The only bad thing is that I watched it so fast that now I am tapping my fingers waiting for the fourth season. Don't miss this one!",1225843200,18,1538,4.224489795918367
3449593,5,B001AI776G,"I love Criminal Minds and began watching the first two series when I lived in the Cayman Islands. Naturally I ordered the third series from the USA because it was released a few months before the UK version, but....BEWARE I was charged a massive 12 tax. This is going to make me think about ordering from abroad with Amazon again

3449605,5,B001AI776G,"Like many others, I approached this season with trepidation.  Jason Gideon was the lynchpin of the team and Mandy Patankin the strongest actor.  Losing him, felt like the show might flounder, but just the opposite...this is the best overall year for the series yet and it shows great potential for character growth.

Rather than circle one bright star, the team members began to shine individually and the focus shifted from one star to the universe of the BAU, delving into the great toll this type of work takes on relationships and the crutches even profilers use to cope when the demons come.  Rather than glorify serial criminals or the dedicated professionals who hunt them - Criminal Minds explores the tortured and twisted psyches of those who do great evil and why - if that can ever truly be understood.

It is compelling television, well made drama - one in which you care about the outcome and the people and that has balanced it's losses with it's gains and the sum total is quite gratifying to watch.  Bravo, well done.",1225324800,,1033,4.743016759776537
3449606,1,B001AI776G,"The Criminal Minds seasons are wonderful but in this set the last disk was cracked and it wouldn't run in our DVD so I ended up having to buy a whole other set just to see the last disk. I lost $42.00 but have learned not to order DVD's on line. There are no instructions on returning damaged items, or on refunds. So you're better off buying locally even if it costs a bit more.",1224806400,,379,4.066666666666666
3449607,5,B001AI776G,"Another cracking season of criminal minds, brilliant program.
Only 1 small criticism. The review on the website (and to be, fair the back of the dvd) state this dvd has English subtitles. I find sometimes the characters say things quickly or quietly and you miss important bits and have to repeatedly rewind. Don't be fooled. There are no subtitles on this dvd!!
Anyway, other than that, this season is excellent, with some interesting twists on the bad guys. Well worth the money.",1224460800,24,481,4.878048780487805
