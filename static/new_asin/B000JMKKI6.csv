2677966,5,B000JMKKI6,"My sons, 2 & 5 yrs old just LOVE to watch this movie over and over again. So do I. It's only a 20-minute film, so it's just perfect for friends and family gathering events with kids. The movie contains rhyming narration and wordings that's easy on the younger ears. Listening to it feels like someone is reading us a very good Christmas book. The music are pleasant to hear, my 2 yrs old dances to the tunes. It also has funny scenes which made my kids laughed. The characters and colors are so vibrant and cute, and most of all, it truly reflects the core of Christian faith, which I find really refreshing.",1164672000,5,608,4.342105263157895
2677967,5,B000JMKKI6,We watched this movie on a Direct TV channel (surprise) and loved it!  My four-year old daughter watched the whole 30 minutes without flinching and that says a lot.  It's explained so simply and with such wonderful animation that even I was drawn to watch it and I never tired of it either.  This is definitely a must-have for your Christmas collection.  Thanks to Exclaim Entertainment for a refreshing and long overdue nativity story for everyone!,1164326400,17,449,4.868421052631579
2677968,5,B000JMKKI6,"What a refreshing presentation of the Nativity! The video follows the Biblical accounts in an entertaining but meaningful way. The birth of Jesus is clearly identified as a fulfillment of Old Testament prophecy. The writing, animation and music are excellent! This should become a must-see Christmas classic, as it is a timeless story that often gets lost in the hubbub of the season.",1164153600,3,384,5.111111111111111
2677969,5,B000JMKKI6,I watched this DVD last night and it immediately put me in the mood for Christmas.  The soundtrack is so good that I want to track down this music on CD.  The story is beautifully animated and the characters are so cute.  They look like hand-carved German Christmas ornaments.  I enjoyed the script's rhyming couplets which often use quotes of traditional Christmas songs.,1163548800,4,372,4.857142857142857
2677970,5,B000JMKKI6,"When I heard about this movie coming out, I knew we had to get it.  We have the Boz movies also done by this company, and I knew this would be good.  If you want to help your children understand what Christmas really is, then get this movie.  My kids, ages 3 and 5, just loved it.  As did I.  The quoting of Christmas songs throughout the movie was cute, and the story was well told.  This movie would be good for kids of all ages.  I'm buying copies for all my nieces and nephews for Christmas!  This is a Christian company putting out Christian works, and they're doing an excellent job.",1163462400,3,589,4.196428571428571

Contains lots of great detail & yet keeps a toddler's attention!  Definitely something he can grow into as well over the years.  One very cute thing is that the characters often quote the lines from familiar Christmas carols.  ;)  Excellent!!!!,1163462400,16,422,4.928571428571429

I like to be accurate in the the story and I've seen a few things that I'm not convinced by, but due to the age group targeted and the prevailing misconceptions I'm willing to let them go because the animation and storyline perspective are fresh and fun. Way to go Exclaim!",1449100800,,438,4.226190476190476

And with Andy Griffith as the narrator is just cannot get any better. The length and presentation are perfect for little kids, but the beauty of it will capture the attention of every age. We watch this several times every Christmas season and it is a family favorite. A tradition we will carry on for years.

2678057,3,B000JMKKI6,"I wanted to poke my eye out the first time we watched this. The rhymes are forced, the supporting characters' voices are cheesy and over-acted (case in point, Herod's), and I'm not a fan of ""Veggie Tales""-style animation. That said, my 2 1/2 year old really likes it. He watched it four times yesterday morning. ::banging my head on the wall::",1387238400,,343,4.639344262295082

She watched it every time they went somewhere in the vehicle.  My daughter, her mother, says that she knows the movie by heart and I am sure that my granddaughter does too!  My granddaughter loves it, and my daughter and I have to admit that we love it too!  I ordered this video again this year for my other two grandchildren.  I know that they will love it too!  Thank you for producing such a wonder animated film!  I would really like to see more animated films produced of Bible stories for children.  Bless you for your excellent work!

We both loved it and bought it right away! Since then, this is my favorite Christmas movie next to A Christmas Carol. I love how every year my family and I sit down before unwrapping our gifts to watch the film! I took this to my church for the Faith Formation program to show to my third graders and everyone at the church loves it too! I may be in college now, but I always love watching this video over and over! I love showing this movie to everyone one of my friends and I can't wait to show my own children one day :) I don't think there's a better movie out there that's great for the whole family, regardless of what age!

2678099,3,B000JMKKI6,"My family loves the Boz movies, and so we were excited to try this Christmas video by Exclaim Entertainment.  It was cute.  The animation was well-done and humorous.  The unifying theme of this video is the traditional Christmas carols.  They incorporate a number of them, even the Little Drummer Boy.  The arrangements are fresh and upbeat.

I was disappointed, though, that it shows the wisemen coming to the manger on Christmas Eve rather than to a house when Jesus was a toddler.  I know most people put the wisemen in the nativity scene, especially if you don't celebrate Epiphany.  But as a mom who's trying to teach children the biblical account, I would really appreciate stories that followed the Gospel narratives more closely.  It's amazing how hard those are to find...",1357084800,7,781,4.900763358778626

It tells the story from the fresh perspective of the wise men and includes a LOT of good background info that might otherwise seem boring to kids. The rhyming narration and lively background music kept them both engaged, and the animation was modern and fun to watch.  We have since loaned it to my daughter's school and had cousins and friends watch it with us.  Every kid, no matter the age, has loved it. Even my husband and I enjoy it... which is good since my kids play it on repeat. It is WONDERFUL... I only wish it could be longer.",1353974400,,648,4.295081967213115

2678145,5,B000JMKKI6,My 3 year old is obsessed. Its January and she still watches it every day. She has learned the true meaning of Xmas and the whole story of the birth of Jesus. I've watched it with her many times and still love it.,1326153600,,213,3.9767441860465116
2678146,5,B000JMKKI6,"We got this DVD after our babysitter brought it over for the kids to watch one day, and we fell in love. It's quite short - only about 25 minutes long, give or take - which makes it easy to pop in without sitting my kids in front of the TV for a couple hours at a time.

The DVD tells the Christmas story from the perspective of three Wise Men, following the star to the baby Jesus. It follows the Biblical account accurately, and my husband and I felt that the added details (ie, names for the Wise Men, personalities for the characters, etc) were relatively harmless and did not distract from the true Biblical account.

The music is incredibly fun, uplifting, and wonderful - using the words of the Christmas carols we all know (ie, Joy to the World, Angels We Have Heard On High, We Three Kings, etc). Sometimes, as another reviewer said, the characters quote familiar Christmas songs as well.

The animation is fun, well-done, and brightly colorful. My children absolutely love this movie, and it will, without a doubt, be our #1 ""movie before Christmas"" tradition each year. Beautifully done. I hope Amazon gets this DVD and sells it for a reasonable price soon (we bought it for 10 dollars at our local Christian bookstore).",1324166400,,1231,4.586363636363636

The movie explains the story of the three wisemen and the birth of Jesus in simple terms and the music is great.  we actually hoped to find a sound track.  I can't think of any reason anyone would be disappointed with this DVD.",1305072000,,430,4.083333333333333
2678158,5,B000JMKKI6,"This was a great Christmas movie for my 2.5 and nearly 4 year old. We don't do a lot of screen time and when we do, we prefer to keep it shorter for their ages, so this was perfect. It can be hard to find good, shorter movies for kids.
The boys both loved it, and my husband and I were entertained (and touched!) by it as well. My husband even thought it would be great for one of those traditional Christmas videos to watch with the boys every year.
A few minutes in, the grandparents stopped by and sat down to watch with us.
Very happy with this purchase!",1297900800,,558,4.081818181818182
2678159,5,B000JMKKI6,I was looking for a movie to show my Sunday School class of the Christmas story and found this wonderful movie.  It is narated by Andy Griffith.  It has beautiful animation and cool versions of favorite Christmas hymns.  I recommend this to anyone who would like a simple story that tells the story of the Good News.,1296518400,,316,4.508771929824562

It teaches the story of Jesus and the wise men and a fun and joyous way! The music is great. I wish that the company that made this movie would make many, many more.
  We saw this on cable eight years ago and could never find it again. After a LOT of searching I came up with the name, but could not find a place to purchase it. On a whim I typed it into Amazon and was amazed to find it there.
  Do not hesitate to purchase. It's well worth the money.",1294185600,5,615,3.857142857142857
2678163,5,B000JMKKI6,"The Very First Noel is truly a gem among children's Christmas videos. The animation is awesome. The pace is appropriate for young children, yet, still holds the attention of older children and adults throughout its wonderful depiction of the journey of the magi as presented from Melchior's perspective. It is cute, fun, straightforward, sticks to the biblical story while managing to be comical at times, and has a fabulous variety of traditional musical elements updated for today's viewing audiences. It even manages to set much of the script to rhyme while simultaneously quoting biblical scripture -- and it does so tastefully and successfully. How can you beat that!?!

Additionally, this video is completely safe for toddlers and preschool-aged children to view.  Everyone in our sphere of family and friends who has seen The Very First Noel has loved it... many even find themselves singing along and wanting to watch it again.

This is by far and away the very best Christmas video for children and is worth its weight in gold! On a scale from one to five, my husband, children and I rate this a solid 10. Enjoy it together and be blessed.... :)",1293494400,,1154,4.907692307692308
2678174,5,B000JMKKI6,"A few years ago my mom gave our family a DVD for Christmas titled ""The Very First Noel"". At first we treated this video like any other occasionally letting our kids watch it. We quickly realized that this movie does an amazing job at clearly telling the Biblical account of why we celebrate Christmas.  While I don't believe that the wise men visited Jesus on the day he was born, the rest of the story appears to be spot on with the Biblical account of Jesus' birth.  Honestly, I look forward to watching this movie with my family every Christmas. If you are a family with small kids (or you just happen to like animation), you need to add this movie in your home library!",1292716800,,673,4.376

The kids all gather around with their popcorn.the adults usually congregate in the back of the room. By the middle of the video, which is only 23 minutes long, the adults are seated and listening. Andy Griffith's voice and the music are that captivating. The graphics are great.

I tried finding it last year and couldn't. This year I found it at [...] and immediately ordered it. It arrived yesterday, only a few days after my order was placed! We  tore it open and as soon as the popcorn was done, we were watching.

I so wish there was a soundtrack for it. The music is awesome. It will be sad to see our precious Andy Griffith go Home but, this is another precious memory of him for me.",1292112000,2,771,4.340277777777778

You definitely need to check it out if you're looking for something that represents the Nativity story vs the same old ""santa"" movie etc. As an extra nostalgia note for you Andy Griffith appreciaters, he narrates and I think threw in some musical notes as too.

At the same time I had ordered this movie, I also ordered another item.  The other item was shipped via UPS and arrived within 4 days.  This movie was shipped via DHL- I have never had a positive experience using DHL and this was no exception- this item arrived approximately 2 weeks later.

It is not entirely Biblically accurate (the wise men come to the manger shortly after the shepherds and there is a little drummer boy), but it is true to the many common told versions of the nativity outside of the Bible.  The story is very catchy and cute and we loved it despite the above.  We have decided to make it part of Christmas tradition to watch it every Christmas eve!

The telling of The Christmas Story becomes even more fantastic with some great music and the wonderful vocal talents of Andy Griffith. With its running time of about 30 minutes it can be a most special Christmas gift to the young ones within your family to introduce them to the story of the birth of Christ.

Everyone (kids, husband, myself) loved it. The music was catchy, the story line - engaging, the use of rhyme to tell the story - brilliant. The animation is in a class all its own. Probably best of all, it was so positive, upbeat, joyous and at times even humorous. It was so nice to view a video that actually is about the true meaning and celebration of Christmas. I loved it so much, I searched to purchase our own copy, a copy for friends, and one for the children's religous education program (a Catholic program). The director of CCD sent me a very gushing thank you saying it was awesome and just what they need for their program since so many videos of this sort are lacking.

It is highly engaging for everyone (we parents love watching it, too!), not too fast-paced, very pleasant to listen to.  Andy Griffith voices the narrator (one of the 3 wise men) and does a terrific job.  When our 3YO hears certain Christmas carols, he always says, ""That's from the Very First Noel!"", even though the songs are done in their own way on the video.

2678239,5,B000JMKKI6,"I challenge anyone to see this and not give it five stars!!!! I'm amazed at how concise and short they could make it wihout short changing the story. I don't know how they managed to do it, but they were able to incorporate and accurately capture all the essential elements of the story in such an enchanting, poetic, and charming dialogue. The voice casting was excellent too!

There are also stunning effects, animation, and music. I extremely enjoyed all the Christmas carols and lines of Christmas songs incorporated into the dialogue as well.

I give a resounding AMEN and KUDOS to the makers of this DVD and I agree with all these other reviews. This is heartwarming, touching, and beautiful! It reaches down deep. It's perfectly seamless and well executed. I am so impressed!

Whether you have children or not, this is a must have delight! Don't overlook this one. It's DYNAMIC and POWERFUL!!!",1167177600,,900,4.8311688311688314
