The little bit more you pay is so worth what you get.  I'd definitely pay extra anytime I could close my eyes and swear Brad Arnold was right next to me.  And you can keep your eyes open and swear he was right there with the onstage option!  Buy this DVD!",1143504000,,425,4.25
2446199,5,B000BY8962,I loved the suround sound the picture every moment of it I would highly recomend this DVD to anyone,1143504000,,99,4.2631578947368425
2446200,5,B000BY8962,This DVD is wonderful! If you are a 3 Doors Down fan you will love it! The whole concert is great! The video and the audio quality are the best possible! You don't need to think twice... buy it now!,1141257600,,198,3.975
2446201,4,B000BY8962,"this dvd is great. for me - a long time 3DD fan - it was really cool seeing the original away from the sun crew (they still had dan on the drums). sound and picture quality is good but really not as great as they said it would be. ""trust me, it's better than being in the front row"": that statement of 3DD frontman Brad Arnold is not really true. you don't get much live-feeling as the crowd is too low. also the music sounds like being remasterd once too often and so it sounds more like a studio album than like a live show. I don't know if thats the right way...

Also the setlist is not what I expected: only one song of the new record ""seventeen days"" is really not much concerning to the fact, that they toured last year (2005) with it. So you might guess how old this show must be (not really up to date).

For the fans: ok, let's get it. it's really worth it.

For others: go and see them live! that will be better ""than being in the front row"" of this dvd.",1140825600,2,965,4.015625
2446202,5,B000BY8962,"I was actually here at this concert, one of the best I've been to.  3DD put on a great show, showcasing their talent.  The band blast their way through the hits and the more heartfelt songs such as ""Away From The Sun.""  One great highlight was the tribute to our soldiers for their service during the performance of ""When I'm Gone.""  Weather you are a 3 Doors Down fan or just a fan of great music, this dvd is a must!",1131062400,5,418,4.1234567901234565

2446226,2,B000BY8962,"I would like to start by saying my negative review has nothing to do with the performance of the band. Had I bought this as a live CD I would have loved it. My problem is with the making of this DVD. Myself, I like a concert video that makes you feel like you're in the front row only better. I have a few videos like this one that bounces around all over the place and you can't even enjoy a good guitar solo, drum solo or anything. I would have loved to have been at this concert. I thought the next best thing would be to buy this concert. You can tell the guys put on a hell of a show. Only to have it chopped up by fast moving clips.",1458864000,,638,3.840909090909091

2446261,5,B000BY8962,"If you love rock band concerts, then you will love this DVD. The music recording is fantastic, with your choice of Dolby Digital 5.1, DTS, or just plain Dolby Stereo, if you have the system, or headphones, to reproduce the incredible range and quality of the recording, then you will be blown away.  But you must play it loud, as if you are actually attending the concert to truly get the accurate sound of the performance.  What is amazing is that their are very high quality (not .cda, .mp3, or .wav files) digital audio files (.wma for PC and .m4a for Mac/Apple) on this DVD of the songs that they perform that can be downloaded to your computer (PC or Mac) & MP3 player.  Playing them on your home entertainment system or computer gives you the greatest quality as they are not converted to MP3 files as on an Ipod, but play directly from their high resolution digital file.
They also give the choice to watch the concert from the stage, the audience, or a combination of both, VERY COOL!
This DVD concert takes me back to the 1970's Late Night Kirshner concerts on TV with FM stereo radio simulcasts. You would watch the concert on TV, turn the audio down or off on the TV, then listen to the concert on a prescribed FM radio station which had the audio synched to the video broadcast.  It was Great!
3 Doors Down is a truly great rock band, so to capture one of their concerts on DVD is an opportunity that you don't want to miss.
This is a most unusual Live Concert DVD which I wish they would make more of.",1370217600,,1514,4.358156028368795
2446272,1,B000BY8962,"Ok the audio is excellent. But the video and editing is terrible.

Out of vocus half the time. shaky camera work. And grainy sometimes.

I think they thought these effects would be cool. But they are not....

Plus a good concert recording will not show the other camera men ( as little as possible anyways ),
it keeps the illusion of being there.

Thats my 2 cents",1368230400,,364,4.388059701492537
2446273,5,B000BY8962,Monster and 3 Doors down hit a home run with this. I have their cd's but they compare no where near the quality of this DVD. If you enjoy 3 doors down and want the concert experience this is for you!,1364169600,,199,3.8780487804878048
2446274,2,B000BY8962,Amazing product and really happy with it. However very disappointed with condition of product on arrival. Case was broken and disc was floating inside the case resulting in the disc arriving in bad condition despite being a brand new product.,1356652800,,242,5.075

Abraos a todos!",1343088000,,189,4.9375
2446277,4,B000BY8962,"The behind the scenes moments revealed to me these guys are genuine dudes... no pretension... no inflated egos or self proclaimed hype. I'm a 49 year old, guitar-playin' rocker who never tires of Led Zeppelin, Jake E Lee's Badlands, Early Aerosmith (up till Night in the Ruts), Bad Company, Rainbow and the like. Although if you're in your early 20s or younger you might think of 3DD as an old band, to me they are 'new' and this is one of the rare few 'new' performers I like. To qualify my opinion, I also like a lot of Shinedown's material and for some reason, REALLY like everything Evanesence has done. As far as this show is concerned, it's live so not everything is perfect but it's from the heart and it's very well done. The different sound options included with this specially produced disk don't seem to offer any particularly profound impact to my ears; just select the 'on-stage' option rather than the 'in the crowd' one. I don't need to hear the audience so prominently in the mix. Comments made by the band members behind the scenes made me really appreciate them though. Success does not have to turn musicians into big-headed jerks. These guys are cool in my book!",1341360000,,1182,4.606635071090047
2446278,4,B000BY8962,great concert dvd except for the fact that right many time throughout the dvd the camera was either zoomed in or not angled right but am not sure how to really explain it to where everybody would understand but the camera people should have filmed it better than they did because i have seen alot of concerts on dvd and never seen one all over the place like this one was with the camera but maybe next time they will do better but all in all its a good dvd and good buy,1331510400,,470,4.064516129032258

The only problem that I had was that I was going to take it out of the case to check the back and the dvd cracked in half.  So now I am ordering another dvd.

2446281,1,B000BY8962,"It was everything I had to not skip ahead to the next track hoping it would be better than the current one at the moment.  It was just plain boring.  There is no stage energy to start with.  And the songs are not catchy by any means.  If it wasn't for the bass player and the outstanding drummer, you'd think they were mere robots.  I will admit that after watching bands like Nickelback and Shinedown some standards get set in your head, but come on, even Keith Urban puts on 10x the show with unique and catchy songs to boot.  Save your money and watch the videos on youtube.  Even the mere $7 I spent on this as my ""night out"" left me feeling cheated of my time more than money.",1312502400,,681,4.152671755725191

2446293,5,B000BY8962,"This DVD, first released as an exclusive distribution through Radio Shack, has got to be one of the very best music/concert DVDs EVER.  No hyperbole, it really is amazing that they've chosen to give us so much for our money.  You don't JUST get the DVD. Check out this list of awesome features:

1) You choose between listening to the show from the audience, or as the band hears it all on stage.
2) You can choose between watching the whole concert footage, or just skipping to the songs themselves.
3) There's a slew of extra footage, making of the concert, behind the scenes stuff.
4) You  can load the soundtrack to your computer or MP3 player -- INDEXED and all!  So you're getting both the Live DVD (my friends) and the album, all for one amazingly low price!

Then there's the simple fact that 3 Doors Down is a most excellent band, with some truly great songs, and a fantastic rapport with the audience.

In short, you've got EVERY reason to buy this DVD, even at 4 times the price!  Just do it.  You will NOT regret this purchase!",1296950400,,1039,4.426315789473684
2446294,4,B000BY8962,"This DVD is an excellent example of how good live shows can be, if captured properly.  The sound is fantastic and the video quality is outstanding.  I saw this concert on an HD music channel on Comcast years ago and then realized it was available in stores.  One huge benefit to this DVD is that the music files are included, so you can burn yourself a CD of the concert.  The music files are available in 3 formats: stereo, on stage surround, and in audience surround.  My favorite mix is the on stage surround, as the stereo mix doesn't give you as much depth.
This DVD puts you center stage and if you have a nice theater system, this will be a real treat to watch.  If you have a nice pair of earphones, listen to the music files and you'll swear you're sitting in the crowd.  All of their early hits are included and these guys don't mess with the songs at all; they sound just as clear and powerful as they do on their albums with a lot of extra punch added!",1259539200,3,964,4.206521739130435
2446295,5,B000BY8962,"If you enjoy 3DD's music, you'll love this DVD. I've seen the band live, and this DVD captures the spirit of their performance. The sound and video quality are excellent. It does seem too short, but part of the reason is because it is so good that you want it to keep going! My only complaint is similar to my problem with many other concert videos... the director (or whoever did the editing) felt that no single shot was worth more than about 5 seconds so the camera jumps around too much. It really lacks focus on the guitar action, especially during riffs... I want to see the action! But, even with that problem, this is still a great DVD. I wish they would put out another one with current music.",1250812800,,702,4.366412213740458

THEY WERE THE FIRST BAND TO PLAY AT THE GRAND OPENING OF THE BILOXI, MISSISSIPPI HARD ROCK CASINO!!! THIS BAND ROCKS!!! THIS CONCERT DVD IS AWESOME!!!

There have already been many reviews, so I won't get into detail. The band consists of 2 guitar players, a bass guitar player, a drummer and Brad Arnold on lead vocals. The set list consists of 13 songs, all very well performed.

When they perform ""Love Me When I'm Gone"", they have video of U.S.Military Service Men and Women leaving their families to go and serve our country. At the end of the song, the Crowd shout's U.S.A., U.S.A., U.S.A.!!! During this there is an American Flag shown on the ""Big Screen"".
Then Brad Arnold shouts to the crowd, ""we're living in the greatest country in the world, my friend""!!!
