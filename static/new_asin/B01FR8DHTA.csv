8761344,4,B01FR8DHTA,"Until I attended a travel show earlier this year in Philadelphia (where I live), I had never heard of travel writer Peter Greenberg. Though  for three years  he has hosted a series of 30-minute shows on PBS (produced by WTTW in Chicago), the series has never aired on my local PBS station. I found Greenberg to be engaging in his presentation and I came home with lots of helpful notes.
I just discovered that PBS home video has released the show on DVD. I have Seasons 2 and 3 (and only Season 3 is on Amazon)  . Anyway, this is a review of Season 3

Each episode runs 26 minutes, but there are supported by commercials at beginning and end (and they are by travel destinations or hotel companies), so the core content is about 23 minutes for each episode. The DVD contains six episodes and each episode has about seven short chapters. Green berg is in about half of them. The others are from the legal expert (who tells you about travel lawsuits) or some handy tips Each episode has a destination feature  a place you might not travel to. There are also sections on surveys such as the city with the most attitude, the city with most rats,  etc.

In one segment Greenberg shows you unusual group excursions that you can take.  such as one that Trafalgar Tours gives in Italy where the group cooks their own meal. Of course he never explains how much this excursion costs  but its also not a small group.

The phrase fear is used in a few episodes when Greenberg discusses safety (both in possible bodily injury during a coup or health ( a virus), and says to go anyway. Then there is a regular segment titled Dont Go there

Not every chapter in every episode is a MUST SEE, but theres enough here to recommend to those who love to travel. And you can jump to a particular subject easily with the index feature.

I enjoyed it and am glad I watched it.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.
