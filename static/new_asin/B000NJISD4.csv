8178177,3,B000NJISD4,"If the title leads you to think this is an aviation film, you'll be disappointed.  When it comes to aircraft and flying, ""Clear Skies"" is a dud.  The flying scenes were special effects with toy airplanes.

It's something different -- a film that helps viewers understand another cruel dimension of Soviet society.  The plot involves a World War II Soviet pilot (Yevgeni Urbansky) who was taken by the Germans after a crash.  Aleksei spent the remainder of the war in a POW camp in Germany, and when he returned to the Soviet Union he was disgraced.  He turned to drink, but his wife Sasha (Nina Drobysheva) -- honored by the Party as a model worker, fortunately -- never lost faith in him.  After the death of Stalin he was rehabilitated, received his decorations for bravery during the war, and rejoined the Air Force.

In the film, this happy ending is due to Aleksei's never losing confidence that the Communist Party will, in the end, do the right thing for the people it once purged.  Even while he was disgraced, he professed his faith in the Party in a dramatic monologue.  It made me gag, but I wasn't there, caught in the system.
