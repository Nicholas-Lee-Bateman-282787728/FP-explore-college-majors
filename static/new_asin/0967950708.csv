7794093,4,0967950708,"As it is in Heaven: an interview with Dannion Brinkley, had such excellent content.  But production/execution was poor.  Dannion and producers needed to spend an extra $20 and put up a backdrop. It is sloppy and distracting to see vacationers constantly walking in the background of what appears to be a cruise ship or hotel.  I kept trying to figure out if any of these distractions served a purpose or tied to Dannion's message. They didn't!  It was just bad cinematography.

If subject or content is serious,  then be serious with the peripherals.

Dannion is too good a speaker with too powerful a message to settle for sloppy production.",1114992000,5,642,4.834862385321101
7794094,5,0967950708,"This is an incredibly moving video.

Set and setting are unimportant.  It is the content that makes this hour of viewing both delightful, informative, entertaining and enlightening.

Dannion Brinkley is always a pleasure.  He is authentic, irreverent, humorous, kind and wonderfully vulnerable. He brings to the subject of life and death a great wisdom, and valuable knowledge.

As a health care professional, I have used this video countless times to alleviate the fear of those with terminal conditions, and it always has positive impact, and has given relief to many.  Every time I watch it, I hear something that I missed, or understand something more deeply.  It always moves me to laughter and tears.

Heartfelt thanks to Dannion for doing what he does with such love.

Don't miss this one.  It's a gem!",1109635200,7,809,5.015037593984962
7794095,2,0967950708,"Sorry to have to give this one a bad review but it is necessary. I have been a fan of Dannion's for a long time. The interview is interesting if you have never heard anything about or from him but this video could have been so much more. Here you have one of the most interesting people on earth and this video, I believe, was shot in a hotel room in front of a large glass window with people constantly walking by. That was distracting.
  Dannion did generally outline and talk about his experiences but there was little visual imagery to back it up. I have seen several pieces on him that were done for TV that were better. Although the story of his life is fascinating, he is just sitting in a chair and telling about it. There are a few cut-aways to home movies of him growing up, etc but there is not much dept there. His abilities can amaze you when he is having a good reading with someone. This video did not show an example or delve into that very much. ...",1002844800,19,966,4.188172043010753
