7914656,4,B00001PE5H,"CHANGE OF HEART has a well-written script (Aaron Mendelsohn) and a well-directed (Arvin Brown) cast of professional actors that bravely tackles a subject that most movies made for television avoid - the impact that coming out of the closet of a bisexual father has on him, on his work, and most importantly, on his wife and children.

Yes, this theme has been used before, but the  films resulting are usually relegated to the art houses.  Kudos to the people responsible for bringing this contorversial subject into the living room with such taste.

Elaine (Jean Smart) and Jim (John Terry) have long been married, have a son Jesse (Phillip Geoffrey Hough) and a daughter Sarah (Shawna Waldron), and represent the perfect family to the community. Jim is a physician and Elaine runs his clinic.  Jim's late hours spent in research result in Elaine's finding a note that mentions a hotel room: she goes to the hotel room, knocks on the door, and finds her husband is having an affair with Phil (Patrick Kelly).

Devastated, Elaine has to work through the disbelief and the anger that Jim has been a closeted gay all his life and has finally played out his gay desire and need.  The film is about how each memeber of the family copes with the 'change', how each finds support, and how each discover their own occult motivations in dealing with the fact that Jim is at last acting out his sexuality.

The characters are well-drawn and if they each seem to have over-the-top responses at first, the writer and director have used these extremes to make the resolution more poignant.  Some may feel the film is a bit to ""Hallmark""-like, but remember this was first intended for television and if the script has some flaws they are minimal in comparison to the bravery of placing this discussion before the public.

7914657,3,B00001PE5H,"Is it just my imagination or have the number of made for television movies that show up on video actually decreasing?  DVD seems to have brought about the phenomenon of a season's worth of a series being made available in that format, but unless they decide to package several different TV movies together, it probably won't be the case that we'll be seeing a lot of them on DVD.  And, as I say, they seemed to be showing up on VHS less and less frequently in recent years. Could that be one of the reasons why this particular film is listing at such a high price currently (almost double what many cinematic releases are going for)?
It's too bad that that hefty price tag will probably put off a number of prospective purchasers of what is, after all, a worthy project.  This ""Lifetime Original Film"" is an intelligent, well-acted drama that addresses a real-life situation that many people face--namely, what happens when one partner in a seemingly happy marriage discovers or, perhaps more accurately, begins to come to terms with his or her homosexuality.  It's a topic that cinematic releases (FAR FROM HEAVEN) have also covered, and while CHANGE OF HEART may lack the artistry (to say nothing of the budget)of that film, it is nonetheless very good indeed in its more humble, straightforward way.
Sure one could argue about some of the plot developments, including some key ones.  Leaving motel room numbers on your desk calendar is never a good idea if you're fooling around in any way, shape or form.  The ""discovery"" scene is almost ludicrous, therefore, but the film really does recover.  The effects on family members are not glossed over, and the reactions of the couple's two teenage children ring true and are sensitively handled.
Certainly many viewers will find the film a bit too neatly resolved, and that's one of the problems with the average TV movie...and even some above average ones.  But unlike FAR FROM HEAVEN, this film takes place in the 90s, and therefore familial reconciliation of a sort is more likely and dramatically plausible.",1076198400,2,2060,4.832386363636363
