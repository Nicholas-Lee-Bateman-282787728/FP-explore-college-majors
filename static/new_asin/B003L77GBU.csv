Anyway, to make it short, if you are already a fan of Tina Fey and Alex Baldwin, you will enjoy watching their hilarious exchanges and the escapades of everyone who works on ""The Girlie Show"".

I don't know if the writers are losing ideas but now they do too much racial and homosexual jokes. I would expect those kind of jokes in other comedies but not from 30 Rock.

Season 4 was definitely missing something. Jack was strectched too thin overall and it was just flat-out not as funny as the first 3 seasons. Season 5 is an instant return to form, the first 4-5 episodes being particularly amazing, culminating in the ""Live Episode"" that certainly deserves all the acclaim its gotten and more. It is easily one of the best 30 Rock eps ever. There are gems scattered all throughout this season, some great episodes and Alec Baldwin is at his best here, his acting here might be as good as he's ever been. Every line delivery and mannerism is so perfect. Overall if you are a 30 Rock fan you must own this season, it is one of the best. I would rank it with third after seasons 2-3.",1325030400,,889,4.5625

Jenna's Obituary Song

The fifth season of 30 Rock was a very good one. I think that they perfectly managed to keep the storyline interesting and not to crowded with guest stars. There is some real character development for Liz this season who for the first time starts out a season in a relationship. But of course it will not last. Having Matt Damon play her boyfriend was very good, but also led to him not being available for a lot of episodes. There was not really enough time for us to bond with him. He was in three episodes this season: the premiere, the live show, and the valentine's day episode. I wished they could have prolonged his stay. Jenna and Tracy remain career focused, and still get the best comedic material in the show. Jack and Avery welcome their daughter Liddy. And there is a very nice twist to their relationship by the end of the season. All in all this season left me wanting more, and you will not be disappointed by the quality and humor.",1319846400,11,2137,4.733870967741935
4137968,5,B003L77GBU,"30 Rock has been the most well written, well executed and smartest show on television. Season 5 is just more proof of the amazing talent that exudes from Tina Fey and her team. The only thing that I can say is bad about this season is that it isn't being released until late November.

I highly suggest that everyone pick this up so you can enjoy one of 30 Rock's greatest seasons and televisions greatest shows (even if it is missing a foreign girl with two daddies).",1316908800,8,468,4.379310344827586
4137969,1,B003L77GBU,"I think I laughed twice during this entire season of 30 Rock. I don't know if that's because the show actually got worse, or because it was sandwiched between rising stars Parks & Rec and Community. Either way, I will happily leave my 30 Rock DVD collection incomplete by not wasting money on this season.",1315353600,8,305,4.5636363636363635
4137970,5,B003L77GBU,"I'm fairly sure that if you're reading this, you've already seen some of the earlier seasons, so I won't discuss plot-- just the relative merits of Season 5.

While&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/30-Rock-Season-Four/dp/B002N5N5KW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">30 Rock: Season Four</a>&nbsp;was somewhat lacking, the fifth was excellent; in fact, it was nearly as good as the show in its prime. This resurgence could be attributed to several factors- a lessened focus on Kenneth, for one- but the main difference between 4 and 5 is that Season 5 was funny. Really funny, as only 30 Rock can be-- but the show did feel different than Seasons 1-3. Perhaps it was more of a focus on cramming as many jokes in as possible (not necessarily a bad thing, mind), but the show is slightly down from the giddy heights of ""Sandwich Day"" and ""Episode 210"".

That being said, it's still one of the six best comedies on television and definitely worth your time/money. Episodes such as ""Reaganing"", ""Queen of Jordan"", ""Christmas Attack Zone"", ""When It Rains, It Pours"" and the 100th episode spectacular ""100"" all proved that while the show was different than the 'glory days', it's still an exuberant and manic free-for-all of a sitcom bursting at the seams with hilarity.

4137971,5,B003L77GBU,"I've followed 30 Rock for its five years, and I've pretty much loved every show they've ever done, because it's always been ridiculous and funny, and enjoyable. Season 4 lacked a certain something, maybe it wasn't as funny as it usually is, maybe it wasn't as over the top as usual, both of these things were true.

However, season five brings in enough standalone episodes to make the season memorable. Season five included the live show, which went extremely well, and I hope they decide to do another live show next season. It felt like you were watching a sketch on Saturday Night Live, which Tina Fey worked on for nine years. It was a huge success, in my opinion.

Also, the 100th episode, ""Double-Edged Sword"", ""Queen of Jordan"", ""TGS Hates Women"", and ""Regeaning"" were the best shows of the season. They each incorporated new and bold ideas, such as ""Queen of Jordan"" acting as a pilot of a reality show given to Tracy's character's wife. This episode is simply making fun of the ridiculousness attached to reality programming, but it also serves as one of 30 Rock's best shows.

I can't wait to buy this season. It was definitely a five-star year.",1311638400,19,1156,4.684729064039409
