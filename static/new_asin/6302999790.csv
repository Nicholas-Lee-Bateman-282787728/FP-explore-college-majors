535059,4,6302999790,This movie was much better than the first. It made more sense for a time travel story. It continues on with the main character from the first movie living 9 years into the present he was accidentally sent into. From 1984 to 1993. They sure do show he had been there a while with him having his own son from the woman he met in the original picture. I do not understand why they did not have her in the second movie. But this movie did make a lot of sense with German decendants altering history by having their ancestors win World War 2 against the Americans. What great effects of time changing and the story turning out that the U.S. is no longer the free coountry it once was. Now it has been ruled by the Germans and is in honor of Hitler. The main character is the only one not affected becase he is not truly a part of that time line. But in the end he finds a way to travel back and undo the bad guys' work. Then history is set back the way it's supposed to be. It's amazing how he kills the bad guy's father and that results in the slug never being born cause he gets erased from existence. I wonder if there will be a Philadelphia Experiment 3? But I doubt it. No one is a huge fan of these movies. Or at least not from what I see.,1005436800,25,1240,4.0242914979757085

This is not really that bad of a movie........I don't think it is worse than the first one as some reviewers stated......it is just different. All in all it is the same basic theme with modifications.  The storyline in this one is just as plausible as the first. Some criticized the use of footage from the first film but it is understandable in order to maintain a reference point. From the description by other reviewers I was expecting a lot of footage from the first movie, but in reality it is minimal. I doubt that more than 4 - 5 minutes of the entire movie is referenced to the first one. Granted this one like the first one is far fetched but it is a watchable movie. It is not a 5 star watch over and over movie but is one that you can drag out now and then and watch. I know I will. And the theme in the new world is not that far fetched.

The only thing about the original picture was the fact that they called the title character David Herdig.  They also used the originator of the experiment by the same name.  Other than that this picture had zero ties to the original.  I tried to watch the movie three times before I finally managed to get to the end.  Was never so happy to see a movie end as I was this one.

Gerrit Graham is like the Klaus Kinski of B-movies, overacting with relish and abandon; it's a shoddy performance to say the least.

I preferred the original film and eagerly anticipated the sequel when I found out it had been produced.
I saw this movie back in the early 90's but didn't remember much about it except that Brad Johnson was in it, and it didn't seem as good as the first movie.  So I ordered the movie used on the internet.
While I was watching the movie, I thought how cool it would be to have a time machine.  Then I could go back before I saw the movie and get 98 minutes of my life back.  By the time the movie got to the end, it had redeemed itself somewhat.  One notable exception was the captivating Marjean Holden whom our hero meets in the (alternate) future.  And the German scientist (Gerrit Graham), son of another German scientist from World War II provides (eventually) an interesting double (though it can be fairly argued triple) role.
It must be clearly stated.  This movie is totally unlike the first film (except that it includes a bit of footage from the first), so prepare yourself.  Apparently they were working on a tight budget and this shows up in the special effects.
I think the screenwriters (or film editors) decided to make the audience experience the same confusion as our hero does when he travels through time (I'm sure that didn't spoil the plot for anyone).  For this reason, the film seems oddly disjoint and you have to be patient enough to wait for the ending to fully comprehend what happened.  Are there plot holes?  Yes, large enough to fly a plane through.  But at least the ending brought the film to a (somewhat) logical conclusion.  And for that I give the film three stars.  If you watch the film a second time, it will make a little more sense regarding what the screenwriter/director were trying to accomplish.
If you like Brad Johnson (a decent actor with not much room to move here) and/or Marjean Holden you'll probably find enough about the film to like.  But again I say, this is not at all like ""The Philadelphia Experiment"".  When the F-117 Nighthawk Stealth Fighter was shown to the public, a host of (bad) films emerged with the F-117 as the centerpiece.  I've seen a few of them and almost automatically avoid any movie where the F-117 is used because of this.  If you can hang on until the ending, I think you'll understand the film better.
You may want to rent this one first, before you decide to add it to your collection.  Maybe there will be a director's version someday on DVD.  And without the trailers for some other obviously bad Vidmark films.  I recommend fast-fowarding over the previews preceeding this film on VHS.  Fortunately, these were not on the TV broadcast of the film when I first viewed it.",1074988800,36,2833,4.520628683693516
535354,1,6302999790,"OK:  I loved the first movie, so when I heard that a sequel had been made, I decided to track it down. I was never able to find it in a video store, so I ordered it on-line.  I had high expectations, and even if the movie wasn't quite as good as the first, I would have been happy. I love Sci-Fi, and especially well thought out stories and movie production. THIS MOVIE STUNK. The story was full of technical holes, the acting was overdone, the villan scenes/alternate history scenes were nonsense and there weren't even any good special effects. I feel sorry for the actors who were in this dog.  If anyone would like my tape, you can have it for free.  (But many thanks to Amazon.com for helping me find it.) My curiosity has been satisfied (and disappointed!).",1051747200,4,763,4.428571428571429
535355,4,6302999790,"This is a very inticing and remarkable movie in its own rights with alot of realism and possibilities that are endless, which kept me at the edge of my seat. I watch it four times already just to see if i see any flaws with the experiment. That makes the movie even more exciting to watch. You will enjoy it if you like time travel and history alteration cause by what we do in the past. Can you imagine a nuclear stealth fighter plane back in 1941 which allow Germany to win World War II. Now fifty years later since VA (""Victory over America"") day, life is so much different in America where it is ruled by Nazis. It can happen if time was altered which this movie had done an exellent job at achieving with amazing realism. Thank goodness it hasn't happen yet and won't ever happen because it's not a good place. I know this timeline is not perfect and there are alot of world suffering but the timeline where the Nazis had won the war, it is much much worse...trust me.",1040083200,2,973,4.293478260869565
