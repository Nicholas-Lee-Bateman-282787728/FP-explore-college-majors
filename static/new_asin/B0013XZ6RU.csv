I love this movie because I learn everything about the character. To me, it's not just a mindless action flick. It actually has a story that complements the first movie.

3120551,4,B0013XZ6RU,"Two years after the success of the Japanese Jidai Geki swordplay action film; ""AZUMI"" (2003), comes its sequel, Azumi 2: Death or Love. The sequel once again features the beautiful Aya Ueto as the young female assassin, but how does this sequel fare without Ryuhei Kitamura at the helm as director? One thing that Azumi had proved about Kitamura, the man can handle a samurai film; the director can indeed make his actors look fantastic, he can frame shots that most directors can only dream of or aspire to, and he knew when to cut the unnecessary scenes in the editing room. Azumi 2 (2005) features Kaneko Shusuke as the director and Mataichi Yamamoto as the storyteller. Yamamoto is also the  screenwriter of the anime classic ""Ninja Scroll"". Were they able to fill Ryuhei Kitamura's shoes? I loved the original ""Azumi"" as you can judge with my review of it.

The film takes place sometime after the original film with Azumi (Aya Ueto) and Nagara (Kazuki Ishigaki) being pursued by the ninjas of Kanbei (Kazuki Kitamura), who was shamed by the beautiful assassin in the first film. Joined by a beautiful female ninja (Chiaki Kuriyama, Kill Bill), the duo is adamant in completing their mission in pursuing Masayuki Sanada (Mikijiro Hira); the last remaining lord of the Toyotomi bent on rebelling against the Tokugawa. The remaining lord is protected by elite killers that they have to cut through to finish their mission. Along the way, they cross paths with a small band of bandits with Ginkaku (Shun Oguri) as its leader. Ginkaku resembles Azumi's childhood friend; Nachi, who she killed as her ""rite of passage"" (in the first film). Just who is Ginkaku, and what is his relationship with the late lamented Nachi?

Azumi is based on the manga of the same name. While the original director's cut clocked in at 143 minutes, this sequel is significantly shorter; since it does have so little to work with in terms of plot. There is a lot of action and swordplay in this sequel, and although they are decent in their own right; the swordfights just cannot match the quality of the action, the style and the ""wallop"" of Kitamura's awesome action sequences. The swordfights are bloody and slashing but without Kitamura's excellence in filming these sequences, the action sequences are missing something. It didn't have the ""WOW"" factor omnipresent in the original that the sequences lacked credibility. Aya Ueto looked a bit awkward in some of the scenes, proof that without Kitamura's editing and quick cuts, the actress is missing a lot of the ""punch"" she exhibited in the original film.

The villains in this installment seem to carry more of the anime influence than the previous film. Specifically, the ninja who engages Azumi in combat and the big guy who throws the huge spear around, they do look heavily inspired by ""Ninja Scroll"". Director Shusuke Kaneko is known for directing ""Godzilla"" films so expect his style to be very different from Kitamura's style. (It is very ironic that Kitamura wasn't available to shoot this sequel because he was directing ""Godzilla final wars""). The villains in Azumi 2 have a some manner of mystical powers, but unfortunately, they are more for show than actually giving our heroine that much trouble. Aside from random action sequences, screenwriter Yamamoto attempts to hide the limited premise in adding his variation of a budding teen romance; of course it is no surprise that Ginkaku finds Azumi very attractive, that he makes it his goal to show her the error of her killing ways.

Director Shusuke redeems himself by once again pitting Azumi against an army as in the original film. Azumi slices and dices her way through a gauntlet of Kanbei's foot soldiers near the climax. He even attempts to do something different in regards to camera work by placing a camera behind Ueto's shoulders while she cuts down foot soldiers. Thank goodness he abandoned the idea after a few seconds. I suppose Shusuke intended to rival Kitamura's terrific 360 degree camera work that was done in the duel between Bijomaru and Azumi is the original film. Shusuke tried but he just couldn't attain the original`s visual impact.

Ultimately, this sequel isn't a lost cause. There is an effective twist near the climax and it does close the story of Azumi. People who are hyped up for this sequel and expecting the same quality of action and story in the original ""Azumi"" will be disappointed. Despite its faults, the film does present a moral commentary as to how people can make hard choices and why there must be people like our beautiful heroine. It also questions as to how people like Priest Tenkai can name who lives and who dies.

The film ponders the moral question: When all a person had ever lived for is one mission, after all is said and done, where does she go next? Who is Azumi...an assassin or a savior?

Recommended timidly, rent it first. [3  - Stars]

Note: I gave the original ""Azumi"" 4  + Stars.

My fianc and I are big anime and manga fans, and though this movie is live action, we thought we might enjoy it - unfortunately, this movie feels so superficial and lacking in real depth that it comes off, at best, as an amusing adventure movie.

The titular Azumi is a young woman, trained from youth as a ruthless assassin, even to the point of killing her closest friends when ordered to do so. Despite her sheltered upbringing and harsh education, Azumi (as well as her assassin comrades) switches schizophrenically from happy-go-lucky light-hearted skipping through the movie to fierce facial expressions that seem to be conveying that either the situation at hand is serious or the young actress has a mild headache.

And perhaps Azumi is *supposed* to be naive, perhaps her 'innate' girlishness is supposed to shine through despite being a honed killing machine, but the result is a character who is more caricature than anything else - the murder of her best friend doesn't particularly haunt her except as a method to shoe-horn in an unlikely doppelganger as an instant love interest. She has no qualms about sharing her secret training with the people she meets, culminating in a stereotypical ""here's my Achilles heel, just for future reference"" lesson, leaving the eventual 'twist' quite obvious at that point.

There's nothing wrong with this movie if you just really like live-action, Waif Fu movies with a cute little girl beating up everything that moves. And the spider web trap near the end, reminiscent of other, better movies in recent memory, was certainly quite nice to see. But I would prefer a heroine with a little more actual depth to her character, and not as a caricature of ""kawaii killing girl!"". The supporting cast, too, all seem largely comical and two-dimensional, which is a shame because the underlying plot could have potentially been very interesting. Unless you just have an obsession with cute ninja girls, I'd give this movie a pass.

3120570,5,B0013XZ6RU,"Azumi and Azumi 2 ... both masterpeices in the action/martial arts genre.  I would have to say that the second one is the better of the two.

The first Azumi was awesome.  I own it and I've seen it about five times.  However, it was too long and, at times, unneccesarily drawn out.  30 minutes could have been cut from the movie without changing anything.  Less is sometimes more.  The story of the first movie was too thin to be drawn out over two hours.  It didn't really have that thick of a plot... but then again, it is an action movie, and you don't typically watch those when you are expecting an awesome plot.

The second movie, however, was a bit shorter, not drawn out, moved much faster, and had a decent plot to go with it.  The only thing that felt lacking was the absence of Bijomaru, the show-stealing psycho who was in the first film.  Of course, he died, so he couldn't be in the sequel... but he had a LOT of fans.

The one big thing the movie did wrong is something that fans will have no issue with -- when you make a movie, you should NEVER have a supporting actress be more beautiful than the heroine.  EVER.  But Azumi 2 did it anyway, and Chiaki Kuriyama outshone Aya Ueto, the lead actress.

You thought Ueto was good looking in the first film?  Then you gotta see Kuriyama in the second.

Another plus for this movie is that the villain had a measure of emotional depth to him.  You actually feel sympathy for him in the end.  Also, Kanbei is every bit as awesome in the sequel as he was in the original film.  So look forward to that.

It's also worth mentioning that the English dub of Azumi 2 is far, far better than the Engish dub of the first movie.

To put it simply -- If you like a movie with insanely awesome action and long battles, you'll like the first film better.  If you like not-as-insane-but-still-awesome action, a good plot, a respectable dub, plot-twists, and character developement, you'll like the second one better.

The remaining lord is protected by elite killers that they have to cut through to finish their mission. Along the way, they cross paths with a small band of bandits with Ginkaku (Shun Oguri) as its leader. Ginkaku resembles Azumi's childhood friend; Nachi, who she killed as her ""rite of passage"" (in the first film). Just who is Ginkaku, and what is his relationship with the late lamented Nachi?

Azumi is based on the manga of the same name. While the original director's cut clocked in at 143 minutes, this sequel is significantly shorter; since it does have so little to work with in terms of plot. There is a lot of action and swordplay in this sequel, and although they are decent in their own right; the swordfights just cannot match the quality of the action, the style and the ""wallop"" of Kitamura's awesome action sequences. The swordfights are bloody and slashing but without Kitamura's excellence in filming these sequences, the action sequences are missing something. It didn't have the ""WOW"" factor omnipresent in the original that the sequences lacked credibility. Aya Ueto looked a bit awkward in some of the scenes, proof that without Kitamura's editing and quick cuts, the actress is missing a lot of the ""punch"" she exhibited in the original film.

The villains in this installment seem to carry more of the anime influence than the previous film. Specifically, the ninja who engages Azumi in combat and the big guy who throws the huge spear around, they do look heavily inspired by ""Ninja Scroll"". Director Shusuke Kaneko is known for directing ""Godzilla"" films so expect his style to be very different from Kitamura's style. (It is very ironic that Kitamura wasn't available to shoot this sequel because he was directing ""Godzilla final wars""). The villains in Azumi 2 have a some manner of mystical powers, but unfortunately, they are more for show than actually giving our heroine that much trouble. Aside from random action sequences, screenwriter Yamamoto attempts to hide the limited premise in adding his variation of a budding teen romance; of course it is no surprise that Ginkaku finds Azumi very attractive, that he makes it his goal to show her the error of her killing ways.

Director Shusuke redeems himself by once again pitting Azumi against an army as in the original film. Azumi slices and dices her way through a gauntlet of Kanbei's foot soldiers near the climax. He even attempts to do something different in regards to camera work by placing a camera behind Ueto's shoulders while she cuts down foot soldiers. Thank goodness he abandoned the idea after a few seconds. I suppose Shusuke intended to rival Kitamura's terrific 360 degree camera work that was done in the duel between Bijomaru and Azumi is the original film. Shusuke tried but he just couldn't attain the original`s visual impact.

Ultimately, this sequel isn't a lost cause. There is an effective twist near the climax and it does close the story of Azumi. People who are hyped up for this sequel and expecting the same quality of action and story in the original ""Azumi"" will be disappointed. Despite its faults, the film does present a moral commentary as to how people can make hard choices and why there must be people like our beautiful heroine. It also questions as to how people like Priest Tenkai can name who lives and who dies.

The film ponders the moral question: When all a person had ever lived for is one mission, after all is said and done, where does she go next? Who is Azumi...an assassin or a savior?

Recommended timidly, rent it first. [3  - Stars]

Note: I gave the original ""Azumi"" 4  + Stars.

My fianc and I are big anime and manga fans, and though this movie is live action, we thought we might enjoy it - unfortunately, this movie feels so superficial and lacking in real depth that it comes off, at best, as an amusing adventure movie.

The titular Azumi is a young woman, trained from youth as a ruthless assassin, even to the point of killing her closest friends when ordered to do so. Despite her sheltered upbringing and harsh education, Azumi (as well as her assassin comrades) switches schizophrenically from happy-go-lucky light-hearted skipping through the movie to fierce facial expressions that seem to be conveying that either the situation at hand is serious or the young actress has a mild headache.

And perhaps Azumi is *supposed* to be naive, perhaps her 'innate' girlishness is supposed to shine through despite being a honed killing machine, but the result is a character who is more caricature than anything else - the murder of her best friend doesn't particularly haunt her except as a method to shoe-horn in an unlikely doppelganger as an instant love interest. She has no qualms about sharing her secret training with the people she meets, culminating in a stereotypical ""here's my Achilles heel, just for future reference"" lesson, leaving the eventual 'twist' quite obvious at that point.

There's nothing wrong with this movie if you just really like live-action, Waif Fu movies with a cute little girl beating up everything that moves. And the spider web trap near the end, reminiscent of other, better movies in recent memory, was certainly quite nice to see. But I would prefer a heroine with a little more actual depth to her character, and not as a caricature of ""kawaii killing girl!"". The supporting cast, too, all seem largely comical and two-dimensional, which is a shame because the underlying plot could have potentially been very interesting. Unless you just have an obsession with cute ninja girls, I'd give this movie a pass.

3355067,5,B0013XZ6RU,"Azumi and Azumi 2 ... both masterpeices in the action/martial arts genre.  I would have to say that the second one is the better of the two.

The first Azumi was awesome.  I own it and I've seen it about five times.  However, it was too long and, at times, unneccesarily drawn out.  30 minutes could have been cut from the movie without changing anything.  Less is sometimes more.  The story of the first movie was too thin to be drawn out over two hours.  It didn't really have that thick of a plot... but then again, it is an action movie, and you don't typically watch those when you are expecting an awesome plot.

The second movie, however, was a bit shorter, not drawn out, moved much faster, and had a decent plot to go with it.  The only thing that felt lacking was the absence of Bijomaru, the show-stealing psycho who was in the first film.  Of course, he died, so he couldn't be in the sequel... but he had a LOT of fans.

The one big thing the movie did wrong is something that fans will have no issue with -- when you make a movie, you should NEVER have a supporting actress be more beautiful than the heroine.  EVER.  But Azumi 2 did it anyway, and Chiaki Kuriyama outshone Aya Ueto, the lead actress.

You thought Ueto was good looking in the first film?  Then you gotta see Kuriyama in the second.

Another plus for this movie is that the villain had a measure of emotional depth to him.  You actually feel sympathy for him in the end.  Also, Kanbei is every bit as awesome in the sequel as he was in the original film.  So look forward to that.

It's also worth mentioning that the English dub of Azumi 2 is far, far better than the Engish dub of the first movie.

To put it simply -- If you like a movie with insanely awesome action and long battles, you'll like the first film better.  If you like not-as-insane-but-still-awesome action, a good plot, a respectable dub, plot-twists, and character developement, you'll like the second one better.

It all really depends on your tastes.",1249516800,2,2003,4.380434782608695
