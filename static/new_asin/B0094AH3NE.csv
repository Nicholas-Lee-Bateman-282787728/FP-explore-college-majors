5261224,4,B0094AH3NE,"There is a lot of ""Good"" in this performance of Verdi's 11th opera. Particularly of note is the singing of the lead singers, the chorus, and the orchestral work of the Teatro di San Carlo Orchestra under Maestro Niccola Luisotti. As to the particulars ...

Tenor Aquiles Machado does a fine job with the frequently demanding role of Carlo. While I prefer the vocal performance of Carlo Bergonzi on the Philips CD set (I think that Bergonzi was the top Verdi tenor of his time),I have enjoyed Machado's performance in a deleted TDK Rigoletto, and enjoyed this one  enough to look forward to the C Major release of Forza, with Machado as Alvaro. His spinto voice is nearly perfect for the tenor roles that Verdi wrote during the galley years.

Soprano Lucrezi Garcia is a promising vocal talent who carries off the coloratura runs, trills and pianissimi quite well, although her physical size and near total lack of acting ability, are off putting. Her voice is evenly produced through her extended range with no signs of forcing, although there are some glottal attacks that her coach should address before they get too set in her technique.

Baritone Artur Rucinski was very effective as the evil Francesco, with dramatic skills that were quite effective (think ""leer and sneer"") His mid voice reminded me of someone who sang in the mid late 20th century, and I will have to play some CDs to get a more precise fix on that, but Piero Cappuccilli comes to mind.

Now for the ""Bad"": staging. I simply cannot figure out why modern stage directors do what they do. What possible value is there in mutilating a work that has been performed since 1847? Admittedly, Schiller's Die Rauber, which I have not read nor intend to, was a creation of the Romanticism of the 19th century, and given that Verdi created what Berger (""Verdi With A Vengeance"") terms a ""very disjointed work"". But if the work is to be staged, rather than presented in concert, why not defer to the traditional, rather than produce an approach that intensifies the disjointed aspects of the opera as written?

In this disc, the robbers run around in costumes that are from several historical periods, brandishing firearms dating from WW I to the present ( with an appalling lack of safe handling practices: I'd hit the deck if someone pointed an automatic weapon at me with his finger on the trigger!!). Then, when Francesco kills himself, he uses a knife rather than a more effective pistol. So does Carlo when he offs Amalia! Go Figure!

Someone needs to get Ms. Garcia into a weight loss program. I know that I'm being ""insensitive"" (I am frequently) and non-PC (ditto!), but the dramatic ""connection"" between Carlo and Amalia suffers from the girth issue. It reminded me of a simpler time where operatic performances involved large people who stood in one place and did the park and bark thing. Good opera today has gotten past that stage (pun intended).

Finally, the ""Ugly""; the set. A bunch of stage lights on poles, a backstage that had a skull (reminiscent of the ""Punisher"" T shirt my older son got for me to upgrade my wardrobe), an upholstered chair sitting by itself in the middle of the stage. The set said nothing and was a huge, ugly distraction!

Having noted all of the above, gentle reader, being the Verdiholic that I am, I would not want to be without this opera. I am one of those who believes that lesser Verdi trumps most anything else. The music and the singing here all are very, very good, and while I do like to listen to CDs (and do so a lot) I enjoy the visual experience more, even when it is less than what I might prefer. BTW, picture and sound are excellent, and the personal microphones, while evident, do not distract me much at all.

In sum, this is a less than perfect opera whose lack of perfection is intensified by set and staging. But it is Verdi, so what more can I say?",1361836800,15,3876,4.62882096069869
5261225,2,B0094AH3NE,"Imagine my surprise and disappointment when I played this DVD and found that the tenor was wearing a microphone!  This is grand opera -- no microphones, please!  I would not have bought this had I known about the mic.  The rest of the production was passable, but the mic ruined it for me.  Amazon should require sellers to give complete pertinent information -- and the use of a microphone in grand opera is certainly pertinent,  Patricia F. Clothier",1361059200,4,451,4.730769230769231
5261226,3,B0094AH3NE,"A ""poor"" opera by Verdi? Yes, there are at least two examples of these: this one and ""Alzira"". Personally, I rate this one just slightly superior due to its rousing choral music. Indeed, the famous composer made liberal use of a male chorus as would be indicated by the title of the work - ""The Bandits"". Their best piece occurs in the third act when they proudly proclaim that as brigands they enjoy ""stealing, killing, whoring, and fighting""; not exactly saccharine lyrics. The major problem with the opera is its libretto, which centers on the rivalry of two brothers for a woman and a title; it's the stuff for high drama but somehow leads to a totally improbable resolution. The ""evil"" brother commits suicide because the priest won't absolve him and the ""good"" brother kills the woman he loves so he can be true to the gang of bandits that he leads. The weakness of the opera is compounded by this production. Another reviewer, Noam Eitan, has written a marvelous critique with which I am almost totally in agreement, so I will not be redundant. I disagree with him on the merits of the lead tenor, Aquiles Machado. As a lyric tenor, he had no business tackling the role of Carlo, which calls for a dramatic and forceful, almost Wagnerian, performance; I found his voice unpleasant and despite the fact that he received warm applause from the audience at the Teatro San Carlo, when the cameras panned the audience at the end of the opera, I noticed that there were a considerable number of empty seats, so perhaps, others shared my perception. In the role of Amalia, his beloved, Lucrecia Garcia exhibits a beautiful soprano voice, however, I hope that her acting ability will improve with experience. Case in point: when she encounters the lover she thought dead and should be running into his arms, she sings, not to him, but to the audience! Machado embraces her but commits the same fault - is he looking at the prompter? Director? Conductor? Look into her eyes, for God's sake! Eitam's review does not mention Artur Rucinski, a phenomenal baritone who, as Francesco, the evil brother, delivered the best performance of all the actors/singers. Not only does he have a powerful vocal instrument, but his acting as a mentally and physically deformed individual is brilliant; he had to sing and emote while dragging around a right leg and foot that seems to be in a cast. This man should be phenomenal as ""Rigoletto"". Without him and the conductor, the production would merit even less than three stars. As regards the Unitel Classica Blu Ray version, be aware that even though it offers subtitle and audio options, you may have some difficulty finding the menu they appear on. Perhaps, the recording company will make the menu items easier to access in future editions of this disc.",1359936000,8,2790,4.778467908902692
5261227,3,B0094AH3NE,"I Masnadieri was staged in San Carlo two years after the world premiere in London in 1849 for a run of 14 performances and never again until this production from March 2012. The opera was rarely performed until a successful concert performance by the Opera Orchestra of New York in 1975 and the issue of a Philips recording with Bergonzi, Caball, Cappuccilli and Raimondi, conducted by Lamberto Gardelli. Bonynge conducted it at the Sydney Opera House in 1980 and recorded it for Decca in 1982 with his late wife.

According to the blu-ray's book this blu-ray was compiled from all 5 performances in the run. Nicola Luisotti was recently appointed music director of the Teatro San Carlo in Naples, and this production is the first he conducted since his appointment. Gabriele Lavia, a well-known Italian director of high repute, as well as an actor, directed it. He is considered a 'specialist' of Schiller's text ""Die Ruber"" on which the libretto is based - he directed it (and played the role of Carlo) in a successful 1982 production that toured several Italian towns, and has recently directed a group of young actors in another staging seen in several Italian theatres. He also recently directed this play in one of the major theatres in Rome. In 1986 he produced this opera in Pisa, Lucca and Livorno. So this production of the Teatro San Carlo has generated considerable interest and has attracted fans from all over Italy.

In this staging the entire opera takes place in a single ugly space, possibly an abandoned contemporary theater stage with exposed lighting apparatus, projectors everywhere, or a space in an urban ghetto in Harlem or the Bronx with a broken roof, scattered debris and dead leaves . Colorful graffiti and murals (""city painting"") ""decorate"" the brick walls; in the background is a large skull with the words  ""libert o morte"" spread out. The libretto needs all the help it can get but setting all the action in the same space doesn't clarify the story and is confusing. The ugly costumes are a puzzling hodgepodge. The principal characters are in late-nineteenth-century style; the all male chorus of the masnadieri is in some kind of gangsters' style with leather coats and hats in matching and mismatching styles - from cylinder to bowler hats; the guests of Francesco party in punk or in cheap party wigs and Halloween costumes. There is a jarring mismatch between the postmodern sets and costumes on the one hand, and the acting characterized by conventional melodramatic operatic poses on the other hand. It creats some risible dramatic situations. There is a pervasive poverty of ideas on how the characters should interact or how the chorus should move on stage. Relationships are not clarified. It looks like the director just threw in the towel on the stupid libretto. It is depressing to watch this unrelenting and baffling ugliness for two hours with no change of scenes (or to watch close-ups of the soprano's heavy perspiration).

The four principals and the choir respond better to the conductor than to the director. Tenor Aquiles Machado as Carlo has a true sense of the Verdi style. His delivery is incisive, involved, with emotions clearly projected and lines beautifully shaped and articulated. He is a lyric singing a dramatic role here, but everyone has been singing up a vocal fach for years now (a fach or two: I just learned that J. D. Florez is to take up Arnold in Guglielmo Tell! A tenore di grazia!). The role of Amalia was created for Jenny Lind, the Swedish dramatic coloratura soprano and was written to display her particular strengths. It therefore requires considerable coloratura agility, facility with the fioriture but also dramatic power of projection. Soprano Ana Lucrecia Garca has all of these in spades. She has a pretty stunning technical capability (trills are inconsistent, though) and a full, gorgeous tone. Verdi has a way of somehow ""announcing"" in the beginning of a singer's part the special challenge or requirement of a role. Here he put a few bars into Amalia's first appearance a quickly ascending scale that sounds completely out of context in that spot other than to immediately announce his expectations (or allow the soprano to immediately dazzle?). Garca executes it perfectly and effortlessly, touching each note (rather than just gliding over the notes as C. used to do...). This is a sign of things to come in the rest of Garca's elegant assumption of the role. She is still very young and has a way to go to acquire that artistic intelligence that goes with the individuality of expression of more experienced divas. No comments about the rest of the cast or the chorus.

This opera is like a bullet train: the score has no digressions or redundancies and the story, with its grimness and aggression once started, goes forward directly without hesitation to its absurd end. Nicola Luisotti captures this breathless pulse of the score with rhythmic vitality, dramatic vivacity, urgency of expression and superbly calculated rallentandos and rubatos in its more lyrical and introspective moments. The orchestra plays for him in a state of grace with clear sonorities and balance between various orchestral sections. Luisotti is the real star of this production.

Blu-ray technical quality is fine in terms of video quality and sound. The singers are body miked. I noticed that performances where the singers are body miked sound better on headphones. The advantage of good speakers over even the best headphones is the soundstage they provide, but body mics kill the soundstage anyway. Sound engineers deconstruct the sound to a gazillion tracks and reconstruct some artificial mix according to their skills, preferences and available time. With body mics the result is sterile. This is another example of the maxim that the more toys sound engineers have available to play with the worse the outcome. There are (for now) clips from the production on youtube. You can get a glimpse of the gorgeous interior of the recently renovated San Carlo during the credits.",1357084800,18,6054,4.995044598612488
8535760,3,B0094AH3NE,"Verdi composed much better operas than I Masnadieri (the bandits), so the producer had a difficult task to start with.  My general comment: it is not convincing.  The sets don't help at all, on the contrary, the lights on the set disturb the video images, making the video recording a very difficult task with not so good results.  In addition, the audio, although it is 5.1, doesnt sound like it.
Most importantly, Machado and Garcia are not convincing enough.  A semi-staged production would have been better.  There are some very Verdi areas and ensembles that make the music of this opera a little bit interesting, but not enough.  Artur Rucinski as Francesco is the most compelling singer/actor.  I would recommend this Blu-Ray to those interested to know all Verdis operas and the composer development in time, but not as a standalone one.",1515542400,,845,4.908450704225352

8535762,2,B0094AH3NE,"I have over 150 classical DVD/BRs that I watch on a 120"" screen and listen through a 7.2 loudspeaker setup where the front speakers are about 9' 6"" apart and the surround / surround back speakers are placed where they ought to be. The room has sound treatments so I hear what's on the disc, not distorting reflections from the walls and ceiling. My reviews concentrate on the surround audio, as you can pretty much judge the video and stereo for yourself on youtube and similar sites.

I have listened to this 5.1 track now for the 3rd time, although today I skipped through the tracks and spend only about an hour of listening. I normally don't do that, but my ears just couldn't bear more of it.

The orchestra is mostly between the front speakers, not much of a surround, not well laid out. I can't call that well recorded.
I could not find much beauty in the score, either. Mind you, Don Carlos is probably in my Top 5 operas, I have most Verdi operas and even listen to the lesser performed operas like Attila or Simon Boccanegra quite regularly. Not this one.
I am sorry, but with the exception of the father, all the voices are not pleasing to my ears and the sound engineers are probably mostly responsible for that.
This was recorded over 5 days and I wonder whether the sound engineers ever listened to the recording of the previous day to hear what they recorded and/or what they could do better.
Machado's mic placement varies over the 5 days. In the beginning of track 41 you can see the mic out quite a bit from his right ear and pointing a bit away from his face. But when he sings, the mic is further back in his side burns again. Nevertheless, from track 41 on he does sound somewhat better. Until then, my ears hurt, the wobble in the higher notes contributes to it.
I can't find much good to say about Rucinski, just sounds muffled to me.
The soprano is squeaky and putting her in a coat didn't help.
The father sounds the best with his mic right in the front/center of his head, but he alone is not enough reason to listen to this performance.
All the voices pretty much from the center speaker.
The staging with hard walls in the back and floorboards for the singers to stand on probably didn't help much either.
As for the staging and directing, it matches the sound quality.
All in all, this is one of the discs that won't get played again in my house and I recommend you skip it.

It is available complete on youtube, so you can judge the stereo version for yourself. Play nuit d' ivresse with Kunde/Graham afterwards to hear how a tenor/soprano should sound.

PS: Whenever I don't like a recording I play one that I know is good right afterwards (in this case Simon Boccanegra), just to make sure there is nothing wrong with my equipment/ears. Took only a few bars. Much better surround and lay-out for the orchestra, less background noise, much clearer voices and music. No comparison.",1507507200,,2911,4.466165413533835

8535764,2,B0094AH3NE,"I Masnadieri was the first opera that Verdi composed for an opera house outside Italy, namely for Her Majesty's Theatre in London. The year was 1847. Jenny Lind, the Swedish ""nightingale"" sang the role of Amalia, and Verdi himself was conducting. Excellent premises, but the opera was not well received, either in London or in Rome, where it was performed in 1848. The misfortune of this opera seems to contine. The present production is a co-production between Teatro San Carlo in Napoli, and Teatro La Fenice in Venice. This is the first opera in the collection which has some kind of ""modern"" setting, featuring grafitti, uniforms and machine guns. This itself is not the problem, but the singers - although they have fine voices - seem uninspired, and one never gets involved in, or touched by this performance. I suppose that the stage director, Gabriele Lavia, is the one to blame, but admittedly this is not one of Verdi's strongest operas. The librettist Andrea Maffei may not have inspired Verdi enough, and Verdi never used him again. I believe that this is the only available video recording. I have never seen or heard the opera before. The picture is fine and clear, but the sound is a bit anaemic.",1407110400,,1211,4.7990430622009566
8535765,2,B0094AH3NE,"I MASNADIERI  VERDI

Sorry folks! This one's not much better!
The cast are quite good and the orchestra is spot on. Sound and vision is great; but the staging is off.
Can anyone explain to me why a group of young ""Goths"" which appear with Francesco while he sings his aria and do nothing but stand around having weir hair colours. WHY!!!!!!!! What purpose does it serve and as for the machine guns I am at a loss. And with all the leather outfits; are there any cows left in San Carlo??? The set (I say set as it is the same set though-out with minor changes) leaves nothing to be desired. This production is a plus on the aural side but zilch for the visual.
I would recommend you play it with the TV OFF, to get any enjoyment out of it.
Again I would recommend the CD of the work; either the Sutherland/Bonynge on Decca or the Caballe/Gardelli on Philips.
It's a real shame as it seemed promising in Act One.
I would not say don't buy it, because the singing is really quite good and the ensembles are just as brilliant. Let's hope we can find someone out there who can actually direct an opera and NOT stuff it up.
It costs just as much to stage an opera with taste and decorum as it does to completely wreck it!!
Directors leave your ego at the stage door and have some respect for the composers you are trashing.
I am sure that if Verdi wanted goths & machine guns in his opera he would have written them in.",1384214400,2,1413,4.210332103321033
8535766,4,B0094AH3NE,"The DVD is not apt to win any prizes for excellence of performance or engineering, but it offers an opportunity for completists like myself to see a performance of a Verdi opera that is rarely performed. it's fun to see how the greatest Italian opera composer of the nineteenth century interpreted the work of Friederich Schiller, one of the greatest German playwrights of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. The modest production is suitable and the singers are good, if not great. I enjoyed it and I'm happy to have it, making my video collection of all the Verdi operas complete after years of collecting them.",1377820800,4,618,4.895238095238096
8535767,4,B0094AH3NE,"Based on a work by Friedrich Schiller and composed just after his first attempt at adapting Shakespeare to the opera stage in Macbeth, I Masnadieri was another attempt by Verdi to put some literary weight behind his work. The work failed however to live up to its source and was not a success when it was first performed in London in 1847 with Verdi himself conducting. More conventionally structured than Macbeth, I Masnadieri is not the greatest Verdi by a long stretch and hasn't enjoyed the same popularity as its predecessor, but it's still Verdi all the same and with the right kind of production, even the composer's lesser works can be highly charged and thoroughly entertaining. That's certainly the case with this 2012 production of from the Teatro San Carlo in Naples.

It's true however that the work is initially constrained by its conventional structure. Each of the principal characters are introduced in the First Act with cavatinas that express their nature and their ambitions. The stagy conventionality of this introduction is matched by the apportioning of the roles according to type - the hero inevitably is a tenor, the love interest is a soprano, the villain is a baritone and the father is a bass. No surprises there. Having introduced the characters however, Verdi launches into the highly charged drama of the situation with his usual fiery arrangements which, if it has the right kind of treatment, can nonetheless be highly effective. The secret to making such material work of course - as is the case with all Verdi's early melodramas - is in the commitment and delivery of the performances.

A production of I Masnadieri stands or falls based on the performers, more so than the staging, but thankfully, the Naples production is strong in both areas. The orchestra playing needs to be both sensitive and dramatic, and you only need to listen to the solo cello playing in the overture to see Verdi's intentions as well as gain some measure of how well that is achieved here. The singing performances are not quite perfect but impressive in the context of the live performance, which is where this kind of work comes to life. Much rests on the situation of Carlo and Amalia in this respect and both roles are well catered for by Aquiles Machado and Lucrecia Garcia, but there are no real weaknesses here either in Giacomo Prestia's Massimiliano and Artur Rucinski's Francesco.

The staging is also supportive of the tone adopted for the work. It's a non-period specific setting, but none of it changes the essential character of the work. Carlo and his bandits are dressed like ""dandy highwaymen"" in long black leather coats and scarves, more likely to be riding bikes than horses. Set designer Alessandro Camera's wasteland setting has the motto 'Libert o Morte' (Freedom or Death) emblazoned with a skull as graffiti on the backing wall. Francesco's entourage look like party goths, and threats are made with drawn pistols rather than swords, but everything fits perfectly with the mood and the dark intent of the piece and its insistence on drama above all else. Performance comes together well then with the score and the setting to make this an excellent account of I Masnadieri.

The production comes across well on Blu-ray, although there appears to be some minor image flicker in places. Audio tracks are PCM Stereo and DTS HD-Master Audio 5.1 and the sound is vibrant and clear. As a part of the Tutto Verdi collection, the extra features contain the usual 10 minute Introduction places the work in the context of Verdi's career and gives an illustrated synopsis of the plot and characters.

8535768,4,B0094AH3NE,"Verdi's 11th opera should have been a rousing success. It was commissioned for a London opening, Queen Victoria was in attendance, a good cast had been obtained with super-star Jenny Lind as Amalia and Verdi himself was to conduct a quite competent orchestra at Her Majesty's Theatre 22 July 1847. The music he wrote was an advance over his former works such as the absence of the obligate opening chorus and the concertato finale. Here the main character Carlo and the chorus set the scene and start the drama in high gear. Queen Victoria was displeased, the audience loved Miss Lind but not the opera. Back in Italy the work received scant attention. It was considered shocking, terrifying; depicting men who as the Robber chorus says like ""stealing, killing, whoring and fighting"". Just the sort of vivid action plot Verdi would favor for most of his career and successfully. But what went wrong with I Masnadieri? The problem seems to lie in the play that was the opera's source.
Frederich Schiller is considered one of Germany's most significant man of letters, up there with his close friend and colleague Johann von Goethe. As a reaction to the literary age of enlightenment, the German era of Romanticism was being ushered in by these two and others. The younger Schiller's first work was ""Die Rauber"" cast as a ""Sturm und Drang"" (Storm and Stress) play depicting a terrifying picture of society. It is a rage against oppresive society that deprives the individual his right to make his life as he wishes and to think as he wishes. (The Count dismisses his elder son Carlo who then takes up with other suppressed rejects of nobility-run society) The problem is Schiller went too far. His individualism ended in fanatic idealism as he was won't to do in other of his works used by Verdi; Don Carlo, Kabale und Liebe (Luisa Miller), Giovanna D'arco and even Maria Stuarde of Donizetti and William Tell of Rossini. But in the later works Schiller handled it better. In this Schiller's first work some of the dramaturgy is not well handled. The taking of his own life by the younger brother Francesco in the last act is convenient but not motivated sufficiently. Just as the killing of Amalia by Carlo is simply nihilist and awkward. (Budden in his work on Verdi says she was not supposed to be killed).
The music as a whole is good solid Verdi. At places it is quite beautiful and foreshadows things to come. Some arias are quite spectacular in character devlopment. The stage production is a mess; total Eurotrash. Ignore it. The singers are excellent. The young Venezuelan soprano Lucrecia Garcia sings beautifully and is skilled in this demanding role. Aquiles Machado is also an excellent singer and did well in his long role. Both need to mature and stop looking at the director all the time and especially when they are making love to each other. She needs to lose weight and needs some vocal refining. All the other roles were well done. Nicola Luisotti had the orchestra, chorus and singers under tight control and all played very well. It all sounded so good but...... there's that cluttered mess on stage. Oh well, put the disc on to play and go dust the furniture.",1367452800,4,3180,4.76268115942029
8535769,4,B0094AH3NE,"This year of the Verdi Bi-Centennial has produced dvd's of many really obscure operas. (The Tutti Verdi will include ALL his operas!)  This is certainly one as it has almost never been performed after its initial London run in 1847.  And why is that?

Well, the book is certainly the key problem.  Brothers feuding (and over a girl) is nothing new, and Carlo taking up with the bandits makes for some exciting men's chorus opportunities that Verdi carries out very well.  The ending (with Francesco a suicide though NOT according to Julian Budden&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Operas-of-Verdi-Volume-1-From-Oberto-to-Rigoletto/dp/0198162618/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Operas of Verdi: Volume 1: From Oberto to Rigoletto</a>, and Carlo killing Amalia (I still don't get the reason) are problems as well.  Also, since the first performances were considered a failure, it has been tainted and no one has bothered to pick it up.  Frankly, it is just one that has slipped through the cracks.

I think it has good music, though it would fall into just middling Verdi- but that is still very good indeed.  The Third Act duet between Carlo and Amalia was beautiful, and I loved the chorus numbers too.  There are quite a few others.  NOTE that the forms (double arias, grand duets, etc) are very traditional- but who did them  better than Verdi?)

As for the staging, I thoroughly enjoyed it.  i would call the set deconstructionist Post-modern with debris everywhere, grafitti on the movable walls (""liberta o morte""), and, oddly, a big leather chair to act around.  But with Carlo's world collapsing, including his own morals by leading a band of bandits, it is not so inappropriate.  And the lighting (yes, klieg lights on the stage) works effectively.  No problems for me. Let me also add that the costumes worked for me- especially the banditos in their leather coats and fedoras.

I happen to really like Aquiles Machado, especially his Nemorino (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Donizetti-L-Elisir-d-Amore-Esposito-Machado-Marrucci-Canzian-Schrott-Muus-Macerata-Opera/dp/B0000C7PRD/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Donizetti - L'Elisir d'Amore / Esposito, Machado, Marrucci, Canzian, Schrott, Muus, Macerata Opera</a>, and he was terrific here.

All in all, a very satisfying video release, and, finally we have one of this opera.  Tutti Verdi, indeed!",1362873600,2,2549,5.7801608579088475
