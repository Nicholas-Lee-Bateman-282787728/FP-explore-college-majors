8389428,3,B00362IXEO,"This fighting system is disappointing to me because it specifically teaches as stated by Serr how to beat average fighters and not trained or skilled and experienced streetfighters. I live in NYC where trained and skilled streetfighters are a lot more common than in most places and if you have a high risk job like a bouncer or a cop then this fight system will let you down eventually. It does have weapon disarming techniques within the system and ""quick kill"" techniques so it is not a total disappointment. Just be careful for staying within reasonable force guidelines and you should be adequately equipped to defend yourself against the common assailant and criminal. But if you live in a larger city like myself that is notorious for trained fighters then you should purchase another instructional that will be effective against a superior fighter when practice, study and training is devoted.",1524268800,,901,5.013333333333334
