3846623,1,B0024FAG4O,"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is a cool movie, as are the other two, which I already own.  Do they really think we are going to line up to buy anything they give us?  Come on, Sony.  Isn't the idea to sell movies?  Just give us the titles at a fair price, don't try to rip us.  Were not that stupid. If someone needs all three, great. Most Bluray buyers probably don't by now.",1242950400,14,377,4.109589041095891
3846624,1,B0024FAG4O,"i agree with everyone here, give us this title individually. if we're ever interested in the other 2 movies included, we've mostly likely have already gotten it. this is a dirty scheme, plain and simple.",1242950400,12,203,4.828571428571428
3846625,2,B0024FAG4O,"We all know CURSE OF THE GOLDEN FLOWER and HOUSE OF FLYING DAGGERS are already on Bluray, and most fans of this genre already own those two titles. And it's fine that SONY wants to release them again in a triple pack along with the Bluray debut of CROUCHING TIGER.. That simpy means you could get all three at a great price.
But what about the people who just want to buy CROUCHING TIGER? What about the people that already own CURSE OF THE GOLDEN FLOWER and HOUSE OF FLYING DAGGERS on Bluray? I say go ahead and release the triple-pack, but Sony better also offer Crouching Tiger separately on that same date! We've waited long enough!",1242604800,8,636,4.444444444444445
3846626,1,B0024FAG4O,"Greedy Sony's bundling the Crouching Tiger on blu-ray for the first time with these other two movies.  All three are great, but I already have House of Flying Daggers on blu-ray and I don't want Curse of the Golden Flower.  I ONLY WANT CROUCHING TIGER!

Greedy corporate jerks suck.",1241740800,36,282,4.714285714285714
3846647,3,B0024FAG4O,"I own all three of these titles, including Curse on BluRay.  I like all three, though Flying Daggers a bit less than the other two.  I'm not keen on a bundle-only option, but both Curse and Flying Daggers are available (from Amazon) on BluRay (both for about 1/3 the price of the bundle.  Crouching Tiger still isn't out on BluRay, so I can see some irritation if you only want that movie.  That said, the bundle is a good deal if you liked Crouching Tiger and might like other movies in the same genre.  My concern is whether the BR of Flying Daggers or (when it comes out) Crouching Tiger has more special features than the regular DVDs did.  The special features on the Curse BR are pretty thin.",1247529600,14,698,4.372093023255814
3846648,4,B0024FAG4O,"Crouching TIger, Hidden Dragon stands, ON ITS OWN, as a great visual work.

Writers Bin Wang, Du Lu Wang, Feng Li, Hui-Ling Wang, James Schamus have given us a poetic and tragic film with incredible martial arts mixed in.

Directors Ang Lee and Yimou Zhang translated it beautifully to the screen.

Actors, Takeshi Kaneshiro, Andy Lau, Yun-Fat Chow, Li Gong all are wonderful.  As is Ziyi Zhang, who has a screen presence that could stand up to all of the greats in the history of movies.",1247529600,,488,4.6395348837209305
3846649,1,B0024FAG4O,"I apologize to those who firmly hold that Amazon reviews should be from people who have purchased and are reviewing the product - but this is the best forum I know of to send a message to Sony.  They can make an easy sale to me when they release Crouching Tiger as Blu-Ray stand-alone, but I'm quite happy to put off this purchase indefinitely if it gets packaged with two other movies I have no interest in.  Haven't seen Curse, but I rented House of Flying Daggers and was not impressed.",1246838400,11,489,4.362637362637362
3846650,5,B0024FAG4O,"I'm so glad they have bundled all three together, seeing as how i don't own any of them.
These movies are fantastic, i cant wait.",1245542400,7,129,4.2
3846651,1,B0024FAG4O,"... which is what makes it so hard to give this a 1 star rating but c'mon now- it's not even really a trilogy!  plus true martial arts aficianados with blu-ray players already have house of flying daggers so bundling this is just a bad marketing scheme. sure it's great if you don't already own any of them but still- packaging them at $60 is not even a deal anyway!

i guess i'll look out on ebay for someone who will be selling crouching tiger on its own...

boo marketing guys... you fail",1244764800,11,491,4.258064516129032
3846652,4,B0024FAG4O,"I'd own 2 of 3 movies in Blu-ray - Golden Flower and Flying Daggers except for the Crouching Tiger.  Both the Golden Flower and Flying Daggers are worth to collect as their fighting are exciting, customes are very elaborating and the country the movies they filmed in are beautiful. I also have all 3 movies in DVD format. Hence, I am looking forward just to collect the Crouching Tiger in Blu-ray now.
Cheers.",1244764800,3,410,4.616438356164384
3846653,5,B0024FAG4O,"First of all, Their bundles are to give people who loved  ""Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon"" a chance to sample the other two really great movies all in one package!!!. I would like to address the people who like to write negative reviews about products they don't own or don't have much information or facts about a product before writing a review. Wait for the product to be released before blasting it. If you don't own any of the films on Blu-ray yet you should buy this set. I believe these are three of the best foreign films that have worldwide acclaim!!!",1243987200,7,559,4.534653465346534
3846654,1,B0024FAG4O,"Like the others here, I have 2/3 already on blu-ray.  I won't be buying this set as a result.  Not cool Sony.",1243641600,7,109,3.909090909090909
3846655,4,B0024FAG4O,"Although I can certainly see the frustration of those who already own 1-2 of these movies, I don't own any of them on Blu-ray and I think its a pretty good deal!  About $20 a film.",1243641600,6,180,4.0
3846656,1,B0024FAG4O,"As others have stated, most fans of these types of films already probably own one if not both of the two previously released Blu-ray's included in the set: House of Flying Daggers and Curse of the Golden Flower (both of which I owned on DVD before choosing to upgrade them to Blu-ray). It is an insult to only release Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon in this set! It NEEDS to be released individually. If not, I will either find a way to rent it or bypass it altogether until an individual release is made as I suspect most (if not everyone) interested individuals will. Money doesn't grow on trees, and I'm not throwing away $40 on two films I already purchased separately. What a joke. Unless Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon gets it's deserved individual release this is another example of corporate greed and it's not even one that we can't notice - it's so obvious it truly hurts to think about it. Who's idea was this? How pathetic!

Oh - and by the way - It's not a trilogy. It better not say that on the box itself or that is just laugh out loud funny. Who knew people in marketing could be so comedic? So movies that share some of the same actors, directors, etc. and are Asian films are now trilogies regardless of the fact the stories for the films themselves are completely unrelated? Interesting theory.",1243555200,8,1310,4.527426160337553

8350607,3,B0024FAG4O,"Me anim a comprar esta edicin triple de pelculas chinas contemporneas porque la publicidad en Amazon deca que venan subtitulados en espaol. Especialmente Crouching Tiger. Para mi sorpresa, el dvd no viene con subttulos en espaol, a pesar que en la propia caja del disco dice que s. A esto se le llama, ""publicidad engaosa"" y es lamentable.

I encouraged her to buy this edition triple of contemporary Chinese films because the publicity that came from Amazon said Spanish subtitles. Especially Crouching Tiger. To my surprise the dvd does not come with subtitles in Spanish, although in-house disc box says yes. This is called ""misleading"" and is regrettable.",1266364800,9,659,5.101851851851852
8350608,1,B0024FAG4O,"With Sony hemorrhaging money left and right, they try to make up with unwanted bundles. Well, anyone that just wants to purchase CTHD, just go to Amazon.co.uk and place the order there. It cost me around $18 and it plays in my BD player.

8350610,1,B0024FAG4O,"How about releasing Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon separately for those of that already own the other two or for people that are only interested in Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon?  Seems like a ludicrous marketing ploy to me.  As much as I want Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, I am not going to buy the set when I already have the other two.  By the way, the low rating is not for the films, but it is for the already stated packaging of an unnecessary bundled product.",1254355200,6,469,4.4941176470588236
8350611,4,B0024FAG4O,"These are three of my favorite Asian epic films; with other favorites being ""Musa The Warrior"", ""The Legend of Suriyothai"", ""Painted Skin"", ""Hero"", ""The Emperor and the Assassin"" and ""The Banquet"". Many people are upset about having to buy this set in order to get the blu-ray for ""Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon"". I previously bought ""Curse of the Golden Flower"" and ""House of Flying Daggers"" on blu-ray as well. Once I heard about this three pack blu-ray set, I traded them in towards something else. I ordered this set from Amazon and received great service and fast shipping. ""Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon"" looks fabulous on blu-ray as does ""Curse of the Golden Flower"". The mpeg2 encoded, 25gb ""House of Flying Daggers"" disc is a mixed bag visually. But overall, the box set is worth it. Can't wait until ""Hero"" comes on blu-ray on September 15th. But which version of ""Iron Monkey"" will be released on blu-ray September 15th, original or edited version. Here are some of my other foreign film blu-ray recommendations: ""Re-cycle"", ""The Host"", ""Kung Fu Hustle"", ""In The Realm Of The Senses"", ""CJ7"", ""Let The Right One In"", ""District B-13"", ""Ghost In The Shell 2: Innocence"", ""Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children"", ""Dragon Tiger Gate"", ""Invisible Target"", ""20th Century Boys"", ""The Storm Riders"", ""Death Trance"", ""Old Boy"", ""Chocolate"" and ""Fearless"". Hopefully ""Ong Bak 2"" will be released on blu-ray this fall.",1250035200,9,1414,5.099137931034483

8350613,2,B0024FAG4O,"I have the Blu Ray stand alone versions of Curse and Daggers....Curse is a story so depressing, you will wonder why you sat through it; Daggers was a poor Blu Ray transfer- the DVD was in fact superior---
The Blu Ray version is washed out. Daggers should have been as visually stunning as Crouching but instead is inferior--...the rich and vibrant colors of the spectacular forest scenes in Daggers should have jumped right off the screen and instead was in fact very much a let down--one can only hope that Crouching was a better transfer;",1247961600,16,540,4.6947368421052635

Anyone interested in these movies probably already has those two.  This set could be acceptable at half the price, or if Curse of the Golden Flower or House of Flying Daggers were new special edition releases.  But at this price point, we're paying full price for these older discs.",1247616000,13,425,4.48051948051948
8350615,1,B0024FAG4O,"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon deserved a solo release.  This is an insult to a critically acclaimed and innovative film and moreover an insult to customers.
