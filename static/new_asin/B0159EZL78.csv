7431808,5,B0159EZL78,"Another great DVD by Rodney Yee! He has so many available, yet I still look forward to all the newest yoga DVD's. This one offers another way to stay flexible and healthy. While the majority of yoga poses have been around forever, each of Rodney's DVD's give them a little different twist. He offers another way to do the same pose and this keeps his practices fresh and different. This one goes through all the familiar poses a bit faster and moves more quickly so you get to put in a bit more effort all while enjoying the feeling yoga workouts bring.",1454371200,2,553,4.431372549019608
7431809,5,B0159EZL78,"I love this DVD and Rodney Yee.  I've done all the practices quite a few times now.  I disagree with the other review, I do think the neck and upper back practice really helps to improve mobility.  You will feel great after doing any of these practices - great for the spine.  It is a beginner DVD, but I strongly suggest watching the whole thing first before participating.",1452729600,7,374,4.455882352941177
7431810,3,B0159EZL78,"I didn't like this DVD much but am giving it 3 stars because I think other people might like it.  I was expecting practices that were somewhat relaxing, especially the neck and shoulder practice.  Each of the 3 practices are very fast moving.  He doesn't stay on any pose very long at all, even the relaxation pose!  I also didn't think the voice-over cuing was very good.  I wasn't always sure what he was doing without straining my neck to see the TV.  I expect yoga to make me feel better but these practices didn't.  I usually love Rodney Yee, so I was very disappointed in this DVD.",1452297600,5,587,4.37962962962963

7431813,1,B0159EZL78,Just tried the video for the first time.  NOT for beginners!  No explanation of the proper way to do the poses prior to the start of the video.  He goes from move to move so quickly I could not keep up.  I got halfway through neck and shoulders and stopped the video.  Very disappointed.,1473120000,,287,4.2407407407407405
7431814,5,B0159EZL78,I love this video.  Rodney Yee has a soothing voice and gives great detailed instructions.  This is one of my favorite videos.  I like that it is broken down into different areas of the body so that you can work one portion at a time if you don't have time to do the entire video.,1472947200,2,280,4.054545454545455
7431815,5,B0159EZL78,"I'm a big fan and now even more a fan of the slower yoga.  As we age this fast moving yoga is a little to much, this is perfect.",1470960000,,128,3.413793103448276
7431816,2,B0159EZL78,"Sad to say, I don't like it. It is too difficult for many a beginner or one who's done some of this but now has pains and non-working joints.

Rodney needed to have plan B for many of these routines. I'll go back to an older version of this of his. And give away to the library this version.",1462406400,,291,3.9322033898305087
7431817,5,B0159EZL78,"I have only used this neck and shoulders portion and the hips portion. I like that this video doesn't have some of the weird eastern mysticism stuff in it in either of the 2 sections I've watched. I have severe tight shoulders/neck (scalenes, traps). I have been to PT twice, used massage therapy and am currently under weekly chiropractic care. I've also started using a mouth guard for TMJ, and needed a way to help my progress along at home. I've come home not feeling like doing the neck/shoulders video and by the time I finish, I feel so much better. More relaxed, greater flexibility. I believe this has helped me go from 2x a week chiropractic visits to 1x a week. I'm a busy mom but think if I could use this in the morning and evening I would see even greater benefits. It didn't take me long to get the hang of the moves. I am a complete novice and found this doable for a 43 yr old beginner.",1461110400,3,903,4.286549707602339
7431818,3,B0159EZL78,It is ok but he moves through things very quickly.,1460073600,,50,4.1
7431819,5,B0159EZL78,"That feature is what keeps these videos usable in the long-term, after you've learned all the routine thoroughly and just want to focus on the poses instead of hearing all the talk.  My favorite yoga videos all have this feature.  I am so thrilled to see it return after a long absence.

This video continues the pattern in Yee's recent ""Beginner"" series of having many familiar poses and throwing in a couple of more challenging ones for each routine (for example, modified side plank pose and tabletop pose on the first routine on this dvd).  It is a great way to move along the path from truly beginner to more intermediate, or (as in my case) to work back up to intermediate after injury.  As some other reviewers have stated, it is not appropriate for the brand-newbie beginner.  For that, I would recommend Yee's Yoga for Beginners (with detailed pose instruction section), or his AM/PM Yoga for Beginners (mostly pretty easy).",1456444800,2,933,4.763975155279503
7431820,5,B0159EZL78,"A really, nice varied practice.  I wouldn't say it's for beginners in terms of teaching poses, but it's not especially difficult to follow if you know the pose names and proper positioning. It's also more relaxing and feel-good than particularly challenging. I love to add it on at the end of a cardio or toning workout, and the 20 minute practices make that easy to do.",1455580800,,370,4.606060606060606
7431821,4,B0159EZL78,"Having completed all three of the routines on this DVD, I have to say that the label ""for beginners"" is incorrect.  A person should have an understanding of the basics of hatha and flow yoga before trying this one.

As for the practices themselves, I only care for two out of the three, but I enjoyed those immensely. My initial practice was Neck and Shoulders which did not agree with me. I do not enjoy sun salutations and this practice, after an initial warm-up of the neck and shoulders, seemed to be all about the vinyasa. It felt rushed and it frustrated me.  It was also disconcerting that during the warm-up phase, Rodney's hands and forearms are cut out of the shots so you cannot see how they are positioned. I had a stiff neck for two days afterward.

It took several weeks before I braved the second and third practices, ""Extend Your Reach"" and ""Hip Openers.""  It came as a pleasant surprise that both were far better than the neck and shoulders routine.  Each has a nice flow and a graceful, enjoyable feel in practice. Extend Your Reach made my spine very happy and the hip opening practice left my entire core and lower back area glowing.

A disappointment is that the promised meditation download is bogus. I went to the website to get my download and got a ""404"" message that the page was not available.  I contacted Gaiam's - excuse me, Gaia's customer service and received a reply that the service for all these free downloads offered on their DVDs has been scrapped.

Despite the broken promise of the meditation download and the fact that the Neck and Shoulders program just does not work for me personally, the other two practices were so lovely as to make this a keeper.",1455408000,15,1693,4.561056105610561

8733075,2,B0159EZL78,"I've tried several times to find a way around the criticism I've fostered for a while against this video, I really have. But there's honestly no way around it.

As a longtime fan of Rodney's work and a student of yoga, I would advise against picking this up- go for one of his older videos. In this one, he doesn't approach the exercise slowly, but rather 5-7 seconds for each position- you get yourself into form, only to look at the screen and see him moving onto the next one. This is no way to stretch muscles, let alone establish the necessary deep breathing necessary to get a feel for it. It's a pulled muscle looking to happen, unless you're perfectly fine ruining your concentration by freezing the film until you're ready to move on to the next movement...",1523836800,,766,4.510791366906475

8733077,3,B0159EZL78,This dvd is ok. I wish the poses were held a little longer. Beginners will need to watch but will catch on after a handful of viewings. I use it a few times a week and it helps with my flexibility.,1522454400,,197,3.8292682926829267

8733082,2,B0159EZL78,"As others have mentioned, this DVD is not for beginners.  The sequences are considered flow yoga, with 80% of the postures held for 2-3 seconds.  I've been doing yoga DVDs for 4 months and I couldn't keep up with the position changes, even though I know the positions.  Although the asana descriptions are very good, Yee offers no alternative positions for the true beginner who wouldn't have the flexibility he demonstrates.  I can certainly see how a yoga program such as this would discourage a typical inflexible beginner.  Jane Adams' ""Gentle Yoga"" is the best beginners program I've found.  She includes sequences, not just a smattering of postures, and her selection is doable for a.beginner.  When a new practitioner can feel a.bit of success from the outset, they are.more likely to stick with yoga.  Adams understands this...Yee doesnt.seem to care",1497398400,,858,5.078571428571428
