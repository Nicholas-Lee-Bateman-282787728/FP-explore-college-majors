8079327,4,B000ARXFGY,"I am a middle school civics teacher. I use this video for the part of our curriculum regarding immigration and citizenship. It seems to engage the students and is one of the few long videos--more than 30 minutes--that I show in one sitting. I find it quite informative and have myself learned some interesting facts from the video, such as the day to day operation of the facility and figures regarding the numbers of immigrants who entered via Ellis Island. The racist origin of immigration quotas was also an eye opener and is something every American should know. The video is a useful learning tool and also a counter weight to some of the anti-immigrant sentiment that we here from some of the media.",1345334400,,705,4.693548387096774
8079328,1,B000ARXFGY,"As a high school history teacher, I was expecting this film to be informational and useful in my class. However, this was not the case. It was painfully tedious and dull. There was little actual information about the island itself. It was so bad that I apologized to my class for even showing any of the film to them. It was a waste of my money and I do not recommend it to anyone. Hope this review is more useful than the others that are listed.",1274745600,,446,4.1976744186046515
8079329,5,B000ARXFGY,"I enjoyed this view of Ellis Island, particularly the shots of the building before it was restored to it's present state. And seeing some of the museum is special, if one cannot get to the Island, this is a good representation.",1256515200,,227,4.560975609756097
8079330,4,B000ARXFGY,Students learned so much about Ellis Island in watching this. Some parts might be a little tedious for younger children. I used it with gifted 4th graders and they seemed fine with it.,1178409600,7,184,4.606060606060606
