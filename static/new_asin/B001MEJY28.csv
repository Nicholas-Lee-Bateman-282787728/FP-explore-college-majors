8320985,3,B001MEJY28,"If you're expecting a restored picture for this price, forget it. The picture quality on this disc is pretty poor, dark and washed out. The score was good, which helped viewing. On the DVD is the 47 minute Shifting Sands and an 11 minute Mack Sennett Comedy called Skylarking from 1923. Unless you're a Swanson fan, rent it or skip it.",1241827200,2,335,4.508196721311475
