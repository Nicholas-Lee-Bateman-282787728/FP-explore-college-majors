Filming took place in 2006, so these are not matches from back in the day, but a rather sorry portrait of aging legends taking on some no-namers.
Audio is horrendous.  Visuals are jumpy.  I feel violated for having watched it. My only defense is that I rented it, and it took me less than 10 minutes to watch it on fast forward.  You have been warned.",1185408000,,500,4.333333333333333
8325246,1,B000JCF536,Save your money for something else.  Featured on this dvd are some really cool superstars from the 80s.  The unfortunate thing is that the dvd description leads you to believe your getting some of their best matches but you don't.  What you get are matches featuring these superstars well past their prime against lowly jobbers set in it looks like high school gynmasiums and outdoor parks.  The film quality is very amateur at best coming from someone's home video camera.  Like I said earlier don't bother with this dvd.,1177459200,6,522,4.820224719101123
