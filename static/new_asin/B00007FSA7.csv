1808352,2,B00007FSA7,"Bought this for my 7 year-old thinking it would show some basic skills.  Unfortunately, the skills shown are for older (12 and up)and more experienced players.",1120694400,9,159,5.115384615384615
1808353,5,B00007FSA7,"We got this DVD a couple months back, and my kids have watched it dozens of times. They practice the moves in front of the TV, then they go in the yard and prctice on each other for hours on end. Great Job guys!",1055203200,44,211,3.8181818181818183
1808354,5,B00007FSA7,"I agree with other reviewers who have praised this: it shows professional footballers using moves to beat opponents in real matches, and then shows young players performing them slowly and at full speed in order to teach. Slow motion, multiple angles and clear narration allow the viewer to fully understand.",1361664000,,308,5.18
1808355,2,B00007FSA7,"I don't remember where I purchased this dvd. I've had it for 2 years and may have purchased it with a net (holds the ball) connected to a very long coil-able bungee and large metal screw-in stake to practice my ball control and kick (that helped tremendously and I break/wear out one of these every two seasons).  I did not grow up playing soccer.  I started at 40 years old and have been playing two seasons a year for 3 years now.  So I need a very fair amount of information and repetition and lots of communication while on the field.  This is a very, very short dvd.  Each skill is viewed from only one perspective some maybe two and all the while lacking tremendously on potential verbal instruction on form, positioning....technique. I watched it so many times, and on my own observation, determined position of head, shoulders, feet and follow through of several body parts for the basic soccer kick.  While the technique is present in descent skill performed...there is almost no explanation of anything and I still don't have a solid understanding and performance of any skills in this dvd.  I can credit this dvd to an increase in assists that I would not have had otherwise, but it's what I chose to purchase and had to get something out of it.  This dvd does not spoon feed you much information and is very short and simplistic.  Prior I found something with a similar title at the local library with tons of moves and drills (new enough to have some termed after the famous Brazilian player), no kick work, older dvd though that was exceptional, but can no longer find it.  I also view youtube in the home office and practice on the carpet to have the concept in front of me while working through it.  I think there are better instructional materials available than this.",1339372800,2,1785,4.581761006289308
1808356,5,B00007FSA7,"This DVD is really helpful. It tells you how to do 20 different moves, and actually shows you how to do them. For each move, they first show it done in slow motion, then full speed, and then used against a defender. During this, they also are telling you specifically how to do it. The moves are great moves, not really advanced, and not extremely basic either. However, i do not think 22 dollars is a reasonable price for a few reasons. First of all, there is no basic soccer lessons, or a short section dedicated to telling you about passing, stealing, etc. All the DVD has is 20 moves. Secondly, they could've added a few more moves. Overall, i still strongly recommend this video, and give it a 4.5 out of 5 stars because the moves they have are really helpful and they actually show you how to do them step by step.",1337385600,,820,4.3311688311688314
1808357,5,B00007FSA7,"I highly recommend this dvd if you are interested in learning or improving your soccer moves. The dvd contains about 30 moves, each is show in action and then broken down in to easy to understand steps from several different angles. This dvd greatly improved my game. Good for both beginners and intermediate players and advanced players who want to increase their skill set.",1305417600,,375,4.875
1808358,3,B00007FSA7,"DVD production quality is really, really low. Players on the DVD don't even look like they are doing the moves totally correct. Buy the Manchester United Play Like Champions DVD. It is awesome. Great quality, more moves, real experts demonstrating, special features, etc.",1244592000,4,271,5.325581395348837
1808359,1,B00007FSA7,"I bought this based upon the reviews here. However, the DVD is definitely not worth the $22 I paid considering the amateurish graphics and production (with grating guitar solos), and limited content. Often, the moves do not correspond with the brief game highlights and local league players being filmed for a few seconds. I found the Manchester U DVD far above this in quality and content (and on that one you get to see actual pros doing the moves).",1232582400,15,451,4.7215189873417724
1808360,4,B00007FSA7,"Needed a simple video instruction for my 10 year old who's not getting a lot of instruction from his coaches on footwork.  Read all the reviews on this video, good and bad, and took a chance.  It did exactly what it said; demonstrated from various angles some very cool moves such as scissors and reverse scissors, and lots of others that I can't remember the name of.  My son and I watched a few the day it arrived and went out to practice.  We both picked them up right away. There are some moves they demonstrate later in the video that look identical to others they demonstrate previously, so realistically, you don't get as many moves as you think, but the few are still great. This is stuff that your soccer coaches should be teaching your kids but if they are not, this video is worth every dime.",1228003200,,803,4.405405405405405
1808361,2,B00007FSA7,"I bought this dvd for my brother. he's 14 and he actually knew already all the moves they talk about here.

There is nothing special in the moves. you can find better video tutorials in youtube. they mention the basic moves like zidan's roulette (they call it different) or the scissors.

I mean, if you have never played football then you should buy this dvd, otherwise it's a waste of money.",1224547200,7,393,4.52112676056338
1808362,4,B00007FSA7,"PROS:
It is a very informative and well layed out DVD.
A lot of good demonstrations and live game examples
More than enough moves for any youth, novice, or experienced soccer player to master.

CONS:
The production could be more lively.  It has a tendancy to make soccer look boring.

Overall, I highly reccomend it for any parent or hobbyist who would like a decent reference on soccer moves and tricks.  Instructional Videos are always a million times better than a text book no matter what sport it is.",1218672000,,505,4.640449438202247
1808363,5,B00007FSA7,"Excellent training product.  Well-organized, easy to use, top training material.  My seven year-old son and I watch it together and then go out to practice.  He's already learned some of the moves and used them to impress the coach of a traveling team.  Highly recommended.",1179100800,,273,5.0
1808368,3,B00007FSA7,"Reasonable review of various moves, but some of the demonstrations were much too basic, and did not show the deception needed to make the moves work.  If fact, some of the ""cut"" moves looked very lazy in the demonstration.  My youth team was not very impressed.  A few more demonstraions by either professional players or in-game shots would have been very helpful in showing how to ""sell"" the moves.  I think this is ok for youth coaches, but not for the players themselves.",1176249600,4,475,4.686746987951807
1808369,1,B00007FSA7,"Don't waste your money, poorly done, very basic stuff that every human being knows, won't help develope soccer skills or anything! save your money,",1173830400,4,147,5.166666666666667
1808370,4,B00007FSA7,It is a good DVD not great but a place to start.,1169164800,,48,3.0833333333333335
1808371,5,B00007FSA7,"Good moves, good quality video -- I highly recommend, though my U9 boys have not yet integrated the moves into game play.",1162944000,,121,4.545454545454546
1808372,4,B00007FSA7,"Over all very good.  I wish there were more clips from games where these moves are made.  Maybe several for each move.  Also, it would be nice if they had the move from an overhead angle.  I would very much recommend this, but not to anyone who plays in the Newton Indoor Sports over 35 league and is not on FC Brookline.",1144108800,7,321,4.129032258064516
1808373,5,B00007FSA7,"I bought this DVD for my U10 boys team to watch when our practice is rained out.  The format is great.  It shows about 10-15 different moves, first at full speed by a professional player in a real game, then slow motion, then as modeled by teenagers slowly and at all differt angles, then more at full speed and against someone.  It hasn't rained yet, but I know they are going to love this DVD.",1130716800,8,395,4.24
1808374,4,B00007FSA7,"I bought this video to help me coach a youth team.  I played D-I in college but that was a long time ago!  This video has a huge amount of moves, and shown/explained very well.  An under-8 team will appreciate this video, as will older youth players.  My only complaint, which stops me from giving this 5 stars, is that the film footage of 'World Class' players was a bit middling.  There's lots of footage from the greats (pele, garrincha, cruyff, etc) that would have been far more impressive, and effective, than what was included in the dvd.  Still, I can recommend this video to players, parents, and youth coaches.",1129420800,17,620,4.590909090909091
1808375,4,B00007FSA7,"This DVD is usefulll and great to learn in chunks. I suggest people that are novice or intermediate players watch it. Once you have learned the moves shown, the DVD is not of much of a use. While learning the moves however, it is a great reference. I think it was worth the cost and can tell it has made a difference in my skill of play.",1124582400,11,337,4.044776119402985
1808376,5,B00007FSA7,"I coach two teams - my 8 and 13 year old boys teams - and found this very valuable for teaching myself stuff that I then demonstrate in practice and ask the players to try.  The 7-9 year olds actually pick it up better - the teenagers are ""too cool for school"" to do anything they haven't done since they were 6.

It is important not to underestimate kids and I found the U10 age group is ideal for teaching these juking moves since they are only just getting into passing and still like to work their way through the opposing pack.

The DVD covers each move many times from different angles, and in slow motion and regular speed.  They use regular players not some kids fom central casting which is nice.

About 1/2 my kids get all the moves right but ALL of the kids develop better ball handling and are ready to take on opponents and leave them standing.

There's a little clip from an adult game for each move, and it is very helpful watching, for example, Maradonna doing ""the Maradonna.""

And let me tell you, there is nothing sweeter than watching a pudgy little 8 year old do a perfect Maradonna around a big athletic 9 year old leaving him standing there scratching his head.

I can give it to the older boys to watch on their own but the younger ones are too impatient to sit still and watch so they rely on me digesting it and teaching them.",1124150400,60,1352,4.2952755905511815
1808377,5,B00007FSA7,"This is very good for all ages. It teaches you every move fast and slow. Evry day i looked at one move went outside and i practiced it. Good especially for 8-15 year olds.

7975777,4,B00007FSA7,"Bought this for my 5 yr old grandson who is in his first season playing soccer. He watched for about 10 minutes and then lost interest. However, I think it's a really good instructional video for the basic moves because of the many slow motion clips and i think he'll be more interested when he's a year or two older, provided he continues to want to play the game. He's at the age where he is ""trying out"" new learning activities so we'll see what clicks. I think a 7 or 8 yr old (and older) who likes soccer would get benefits from this video because it's filmed in a logical way that's easy to understand. It shows both boys and girls on the field.",1494201600,,651,4.216

7975782,5,B00007FSA7,"I'm fairly new to playing competitive soccer and find the video much better than any book with still-pictures. I think that anyone who could execute all of these moves fluidly would be outstanding. There are more advanced moves than these for instance tackling isn't even mentioned however you must master these moves as your foundation. Yes, some of the old film footage is grainy but who cares. You can see a pro use these moves in competition and score while doing so. This DVD is for new players and those who are RUSTY and need a refresher course.",1435449600,,552,4.642857142857143
