6486120,5,B00LGQVBXC,Very good,1427587200,,9,4.0
6486121,2,B00LGQVBXC,"Heres the reality about Phase 4 Films- consistency is never a priority.  They go and acquire the English rights to foreign CG films and franchises and sometimes keep things faithful to the source material, other times not so much.  What we know as Bold Eagles is in fact the latest edition in a long-standing Norwegian childrens staple called Pelle Politibil.  Pelle is a talking police car who has been around since the 1980s and has recently made the transition into 3D CG with a couple of films.  Now interestingly enough, Phase 4 has already brought one of these films over here under the name Police Patrol back in early 2013.  Rather than call this one what it really is; the next Police Patrol movie, they opted to ditch any and all reference to Pelle in the marketing material and instead pawn this one off as a bird-themed talking animal flick in the vein of Rio or Open Season.

Of course this would be fine and good except for the fact that very early on, in a world attempting to mix regular human beings with some (but not all) English-speaking animals, we have an anthropomorphic talking police car named Radar cruising around.  It fits into the prose with all of the subtlety of Pixar deciding to integrate Lightning McQueen into Up.

All of that being said, Bold Eagles is the tale of a beautiful park/ nature preserve under attack by an RV-driving female poacher and her daughter.  Theirs is a mission of simple money-making by killing and having stuffed all of the animals they encounter in the park to be sold off as monuments to the wealthy.  The bad news is the Princess of Norway(?) opens the film by proclaiming that were anything to happen to the resident mother eagle and her egg, the park would be shut down.  While the human police officers are bumbling fools, Radar is on the case with an absent-minded otter the likes of which could make Finding Nemos Dory seem scholarly and what ensues is 72-minutes of pretty juvenile CG antics.

Thats not to say the film is completely without its charms, however, and a few of the textures are very nicely done (among these eerily lifelike brown water in the lake and animals that sometimes appear to be almost claymation).  For an English dub over a foreign vocal track, the lip syncing is surprisingly decent, even if some of the choices for character accents are very strangely out of place. (Why does the Princess sound like shes from Texas?)

In all, Bold Eagles doesnt commit any major crimes so much as it does nothing redeemable to make selecting it as a purchase or rental over a similarly priced DreamWorks or Disney piece a realistic option by any means.  Fortunately the pacing here is much more consistent (and less painful) than a lot of other domestic released CG DVDs made on the practice of slapping English over a foreign film.  Even still, though, its tough to get past the sheer oddity in this ones plot structure, thanks in no small part to the fact that this is at its core a story about a beloved talking police car that just so happens to have some eagles in it (not the other way around).  If you're set on trying to make the most of the character/ franchise for the young ones, youd probably be best off to start with Police Patrol then work into this one as a continuation of the universe established there.  The rest of us would probably be better just avoiding the whole thing altogether.",1423958400,10,3384,4.593023255813954

6486123,4,B00LGQVBXC,"Not a movie filled tons of adult humor, but my kids loved it. I found enjoyable, the simplicity of the plot made it perfect for the little ones. The animation of the outdoor vegetation and water was great. This was a good movie for my girls under 6 years old.",1420502400,3,259,4.2
6486124,3,B00LGQVBXC,"My son (5 yr) has watched this movie several times.  He likes the police car and there are a lot of things that are funny to him.  He enjoys the other movies with Radar the Police Car as well.  Its not an adult movie (not very much ""adult"" humor that you find in other kids movies) so it isn't a shock that some adults struggle to sit through it and are bored.  In addition to being reasonably priced on Amazon, it is available to stream on Netflix right now.",1419638400,4,459,4.123595505617978
6486125,1,B00LGQVBXC,Just aweful.  The voice acting was horrible.  So annoying.  Hurt my ears.  Literally.  Sounded like a bunch of ten year olds trying to affect their voices... with screeching results.  Fake nasal squealing passed off as different characters. Especially the lead little eagle cleary voiced by a woman trying to sound like a kid with no success. Dreadul. Forced. Fake. Don't waste your time on this stupid movie.,1419206400,3,409,5.029850746268656
6486126,2,B00LGQVBXC,"I really wanted to like this movie but the script was in serious need of improvement, what is up with this Southern belle for Princess?! Doesn't really make sense, being set in Norway and they made her into a stereotypical ditz. The Norwegian scenery was beautiful and I thought the animals weren't too bad, but I think this may have been an early work for these movie makers. I didn't hate the movie but didn't really like it except that I thought it might be fun to watch based on the cover.",1418256000,3,493,4.369565217391305

6486128,1,B00LGQVBXC,"Watched for a family movie night. The kids ages 5 and 7 watched it, but we're not overly impressed. My wife and I were both bored, found the characters unlikable and annoying. The plot was predictable and unimaginative. There are many better kids movies out there. The animation was not as good as other movies. Fortunately the movie was shorter than normal.",1412553600,5,358,4.790322580645161
6486129,5,B00LGQVBXC,"Great movie, great for kids teaches them about the importance of not littering and protecting animals. Dottie the otter is hilarious.  As far as the bushes scene others spoke of unless your children have dirty minds then I doubt they will even think anything but exactly what the guy said that he was bird watching.  Disney movies get away with far worse in my opinion.  I would suggest an appropriate age of 5 or 6 +.",1499731200,,418,4.473684210526316
6486130,1,B00LGQVBXC,"I'm a little surprised that other reviews I've read don't discuss some of the inappropriateness of the movie. Admittedly, I did not watch the movie all the way through, so bear with me. My kids were watching and I happened to come in and sit down during a scene I wasn't pleased with. I didn't turn it off, but did continue to watch to monitor. At one point the car hears some noises in the woods and says that someone must be hiding. He calls out to them and a man and woman pop up from the bushes - clearly there's been something going on in the bushes because they are disheveled. Then another couple hops up, also disheveled. Another scene, one of the women tells the police officer that she wants him to arrest her and hope he has handcuffs. OH MY WORD. My two thankfully didn't ask question about it, but WHOA.

The movie itself is fairly boring. I wasn't at all interested in watching it. My kids enjoyed it, but we won't be watching again.",1497484800,14,947,4.320224719101123
6486131,3,B00LGQVBXC,I watched only parts of it with my kids. I didn't appreciate the scene of the adults fooling around in the bushes. Not appropriate for kids.,1496620800,4,140,4.423076923076923
6486132,1,B00LGQVBXC,"I give this movie one star. Both the kids and I thought the story line was really off. The graphics of the movie were great, but the voices did not line up with the animation, which was really annoying.",1493942400,,202,4.205128205128205

6486138,5,B00LGQVBXC,"Movie night and what to watch?  This little animated movie was delightful  My grandchildren ages 3,5 and 7 were enthralled and have actually watched it several times already.  There are sweet moments as well as laugh out loud moments and at times a little scary for the three year old but the scary moments were brief and quickly forgotten.  Unlike some children's movies, I as an adult found it enjoyable with some adult humor mixed in.",1486339200,2,437,4.7105263157894735
6486139,2,B00LGQVBXC,Includes some adult humor that is unnecessary. Would not watch again.,1486166400,2,69,5.363636363636363

6486235,1,B00LGQVBXC,I think it's not appropriate for children. It has some sexual message where the cops hide on the bushes with he girlfriend and the car talking thing asks 'what are you doing  in there with her' and it's pretty obvious. Kids won't get it but why even try to plant a seed in their heads about it!,1468886400,11,294,4.157894736842105

6486245,3,B00LGQVBXC,It is okay. I was not as interested in it as I usually a with things I watch but t was definitely different.  May watch it again just to get the gist of it. I I want to see if it does something the second time around. I am used to watching Axtion-packed movies like Super Toenado and weather related things and movies about bid foot. That is where my interest Lyra.,1467244800,,365,4.069444444444445

6486296,5,B00LGQVBXC,"I know that everyone is entitled to an opinion but I do not understand some of the extremely poor reviews of this movie.  My 9-year old child and I truly loved it.  The story is fairly simple but as in life, it's sometimes easy to overlook that which makes it profound.  I'm reminded of the poet and author Robert Brault who said, ""Enjoy the little things in life...for one day you'll look back and realize they were the big things.""
To me, this movie captures innocence, sweetness, parenting, doing the right thing and appreciating what one has.  Those are very important concepts and to wrap it all up in one family/children's movie has made this particular film a treasure in my household.  I wasn't sure what to expect but was very pleasantly surprised.  You will not find an intricate plot but the key characters are endearing and the take-home message is one that all should learn at some point in their lives.  We all have different expectations and standards when it comes to a movie.  As for my family, ""Bold Eagles"" clearly deserved my five stars.",1444435200,2,1057,4.645161290322581

8665716,1,B00LGQVBXC,I've watched hundreds of children's movies. Thanks to my two year old daughter lol. This one is actually terrible. Horrible story line. It's hard to watch. That's how terrible it is. It's like a bunch of 4 year olds wrote the story.,1531526400,,232,4.5476190476190474

I don't understand why cartoons made for young children include adult content. It's completely unnecessary and adds nothing to the story line, which again, is for young children. Additionally, why were all the female characters in this kids movie made to be dumb?  The kids asked to turn the movie off and never watch it again.",1508025600,5,464,5.105263157894737
