2534351,5,B000EU1Q7M,"""London"" reunites almost the entire cast of ""Cellular"" (Chris Evans, Jessica Biel, and Jason Statham) as well as Isla Fisher (Wedding Crashers) and Kelli Garner (Thumbsucker) for this underappreciated and, in my opinion, very well done movie. The movie got terrible reviews and was even called ""boring"" by Richard Roeper. When a film critic calls a movie boring, you know there's something up. I knew I would like this movie, but I saw myself giving it a B- or even a C. Oddly enough, I loved this movie. The movie stars Evans as Syd. Syd is a cokehead who is suffering from the breakup of his girlfriend of two years, London (Biel). They've been broken up for a little over 6 months and Syd has become a sort of empty shell; He frequently dreams about her and such. Then, Syd recieves a phone call and finds out that London is having a going away party...Apparently, she's moving to L.A. to live with her new boyfriend. Shocked by the news, Syd meets up with a guy named Bateman (Statham) who sells him some blow and Syd insists that Bateman tag along with him to the party. When they arrive, Syd and Bateman head up to the bathroom and talk about their problems, God, and love. This is pretty much what 3/4 of the movie is. The other 1/4 of it is the flashbacks Syd has about London and when he finally confronts her at the party. The biggest complaint from critics was the bathroom scene...It was too long and the conversations were dull. Well, if you're going to see it and don't know about the long bathroom sequences...Yes, maybe they are long and dull. If you're going to see and know about these scenes, however, they might not be as bad. I found the scenes to fit perfectly in the movie. The dialogue in the film is really good and has an improvised feel to it. Statham and Evans are great and really get to show off their acting skills. Even Biel is good as London. The end of the movie isn't necessarily what you hope for, but it's realistic and in that sense is perfect. I'm not guaranteeing everyone will like this movie, most people will agree with Ebert & Roeper. I'm not using this review to convince anyone, but am merely sharing my opinions. Hope you like it.

GRADE: A-

NOTE TO JESSICA BIEL FANS:

There is sex scenes in the film, but as far as showing Jessica Biel naked; The director teases you. The camera will move upward right as she gets out of bed or the place she's standing will be darkened. So, if you're renting this movie for the sole reason of catching a glimpse of a nude-Jessica Biel. This movie is definitley not for you.",1148428800,33,2557,4.4361702127659575

One of the things about the film industry that really angers me is the fact that many people believe that as long as the film involves teens or twentysomethings using excessive amounts of drugs, it is automatically going to be good and it is labeled as ""provocative.""  Some people believe this so much, that they forget to write a script, as Hunter Richards has seem to have done with this garbage.  The movie stars people known for bad movies like Chris Evans (the abominable Fantastic Four), Jessica Biel (Stealth and Blade Trinity), Jason Statham (Transporter 2 and The Pink Panther), and Dane Cook (Waiting...).  Evans is Syd (Trainspotting anyone?), a junkie who we are supposed to feel bad for, who crashes a going away party for ex-girlfriend London (Biel).  Ninety percent of the film takes place in Rebecca's (Isla Fisher, Wedding Crashers) bathroom where Syd, Bateman (Statham), and Maya (Kelli Garner) do enough cocaine, drink enough alcohol, and smoke enough pot to kill an elephant without even getting phased by it.  If this isn't bad enough, once imbibing this ridiculous amount of drugs, they have discussions about existentialism, God, and theology.  Come on.  With that amount of drugs, you probably can't even feel your face, much less have a structured conversation about anything remotely intelligent.  Plus, these don't seem like the people who are intelligent enough to have this conversation even while they are sober.  Throughout the film, we get flashbacks to Syd and London's relationship that are structured exactly like something out of MTV's the Real World.  Seriously.  Look at the arguments and then watch a Real World where someone fights with someone else.  Hunter Richards must have been watching the show when he wrote this.  The relationship is unbelievable, the characters draw no sympathy to their hardships like the characters in Trainspotting, and the dialogue is howlingly bad.  What's worse (yes, it's possible) is that the ending is so conventional in Hollywood romance terms, that this film undoes its own purpose, which is to say, unconventional.  The writers revert to an ending that we have seen in thousands of romance/dramas.  And again, what is even worse than all of these atrocities is that these people in this film are completely uninteresting.  I know nothing about any of these characters other than their relationships, raising hundreds of questions.  Who are these people and why are they littering my television screen?  What happened to these people that made them drug addicts?  What do these young people do that they have these fancy apartments and an unlimited supply of drugs?  Why are they so boring?  This last question fueled my anger throughout most of the film.  These are the most boring people I have ever encountered on film.  I don't care what they are saying, I don't care what they are doing, and I really don't want to hear any more of their pompous, self-loathing discussions.  This film should only appeal to the idiots that enjoy the Real World and enjoy watching people imbibe an unrealistic amount of drugs.  The film is pretentious, unintelligent, unentertaining, and should be (in fact, I guarantee) on my list of worst movies of 2006.  I can already imagine a list where London comes in at no better than #2 or #3.  I'm not sure if any film this year could be worse than London, and this rivals last year's The Dukes of Hazzard.",1148256000,5,3425,4.96140350877193
2534353,5,B000EU1Q7M,"I have never been a fan of Jessica Biel but I don't deny the girl can act. London is all about Jessica Biel, Jason Statham's ex-girlfriend. On the duration of the film you will catch a glimpse of their ups and downs, but the downs are really bad, and it seems like the only thing they got in common is good sex.

Jason Statham's character Syd is a horribly possesive boyfriend and Jessica Biel's character as London is too carefree and uninhibited for such a guy. Syd talks too much and he kinda reminds me of an ex-bf..lol, this movie makes us see that its better to be single than to be with the wrong man.

Syd never fails to endear us though, he is sweet and seems very devoted to her. London also seems a little bit too insensitive for him, thus the constant fights with fills the movie 80%.

This might bore the guys, or they might find it totally ironic.

They seem to be always fighing because Syd just talks too much-more than she does,they have way too many make-up sex and too less understanding of each other.

I think I have said enough. It wasn't at all boring for me and made me see the 2 sides to every story we more or less experience in life at one point in time.",1143417600,7,1181,4.207964601769912

""London"" is a watchable enough film but you get a sense of deja vu that it doesn't really have anything new to say that hasn't been said better before.  You also don't get a sense in what London saw in the volatile Syd in the first place.  I guess you can watch it for the pretty people and Statham doing a change of pace as an impotent financier who supplements his income by dealing drugs on the side.

2534403,1,B000EU1Q7M,"A couple days ago, I picked up another deep-discount DVD from the rack at my local Ross Store, You never can tell what you might find and I've discovered some absolutely first rate movies in that rather unusual way. I've discovered some real bombs in that way too. Last night I viewed the ""London"" DVD, and I really scraped the bottom with this one.

Well, let's see if I can get this all straight. There was London (a young woman, not the city) and a going away party was thrown for her in NYC as she was moving to Los Angeles. All of her hundreds of friends were there. All the women were dazzling but didn't seem to have much to back it up and all the young men were handsome and dashing and spoke the F-bomb dialect of the English language, The young men and women seemed a good match for one another. They movie almost totally ignored the large and boisterous party, however, and was centered in a large rest room where the involved people took in prodigious amounts of a white powder through a little tube stuck in their nostril and drank whisky straight out of the bottle. Did I mention the smoking? Both tobacco and the other kind. Who knows what else was ingested there. Sorry, I'm not up on my drugs. The guys spoke in F-bomb dialect (the F-word used as a noun, verb, adjective and adverb, sometimes all in the same sentence) and when the conversation really got going, they all tried to drown one another out. They spoke in awe of a guy with 10.5 inches and all others seemed to shrink at the mere thought. Philosophy and religion were discussed on the sophomore level and most of the interest seemed to be centered around intoxication. I felt zero empathy for any of the characters. Sorry, if I'm getting all the details screwed up. My eyes were glassed over with boredom for most of the movie and I was intently viewing my watch now then to see when it might all end. Mercifully, the ""credits"" finally came on the screen.

Amazingly, this epic saga was given 4- and 5-star reviews by some reviewers. It's something I find difficult to fathom. Well, such is life. To each his, or her, own, as they say. To me, it was one of the worst movies I can remember seeing in the last decade. It seemed totally pointless. It was a total waste of money and time. Why would anyone put out such drivel? Well, it must mean there's a market for it. Some people actually liked it.

Oh, here's a final note regarding the music. When I first looked over the DVD case, I noticed that the music was credited to The Crystal Method, one of my favorite electronica acts. Hmmm, I thought, that ought to give it the film an edgy feeling. Well, I was very disappointed. If I had viewed this DVD without knowing about this little fact, I would never have recognized any Crystal Method music during the showing of the film. Why have an act like this on the credits if their music isn't needed? Listen to the Crystal Method sometime if you get the chance. They're really quite good.

London(Jessica Biel) is about a girl that is moving out of the country and the whole movie is about her psychotic insecure boyfriend(Chis Evans) who happens to go to her GO AWAY party and spends 90 percent of the movie in the bathroom doing Cocaine like there is no tomorrow because he is so insecure to see her and speak with her after they've broken up months ago.

In the end, they talk but it doesnt have a Walt Disney ending.

 What I find funny is that after London and her boyfriend(Chis Evans) talk for a few and agree to take her London(Jessica Biel) to the airport, he is just one of those men that won't TELL her ex how much he loves her and never did. He did up until the very end but it was too late. The guy was such an idiot that could say ""I LOVE YOU...DON'T GO AWAY...STAY WITH ME"". But unfortunately if insecurity and drugs kick in, theyll be stronger than any inner demons he may have.

This movie DOES take place mostly in a bathroom, there ARE mountains of coke, they ARE people we don't care all that much about...BUT

There is some interesting dialogue....actually to be fair there is mostly dialogue..

So if you like to listen to people you don't like or care about talk for long periods of time this movie is for you....sounds like i hated it huh? There was something about it though that made me NOT hate it (aside from the music)..although I don't quite love it...and it's most definitely NOT everyone's cup of tea, java, or whathave you...BUT if you like something different in a movie this gives you that...not to say it's groundbreakingly original or anything but you've really got to see it for yourself and judge it foryourself as to if it's something you would like....

SO...

I recommend for people want to watch something that isn't cookie cutter material while at the same time isn't something groundbreaking or amazingly different; anyone who likes to listen or watch people talk; and anyone who likes to see copious amounts of drugs on display

I don't recommend it for people who already know they are going to hate it, people who love only action films, people who live on a moral plateua where they stand and judge everyone else, and circus midgets...j/k...and people who get bored easily...there we go

2534409,2,B000EU1Q7M,"First time writer and director Hunter Richards delivers a perfectly awful and indulgent low budget tale of an unlikable NYC drughead named Syd (rising young actor Chris Evans) drowning in self pity over the breakup of from his superhot girlfriend London (Jessica Biel) of the title - alas, not the city - and plotting to win her back at her going away party, but only after doing massive amounts of coke and booze with slickly menacing new pal Bateman (Jason Statham, in a largely non-action role) in the party penthouse's palatial bathroom first. Richards' laughable script comes across as an 8th grader's attempt to sound like a college junior's idea of a complex relationship movie, with the party scenes cutting to insufferable flashbacks of Syd and London's druggy sex 'n' scream filled past. As bad as those are, they're still preferable to the bloody wretched extended philosophical discussion between Syd and Bateman during their overly long bathroom coke binge. Slick photography and cool sets can't hide the director's glaring inexperience. At least the actors do what they can with their parts; Evans displays a range and vulnerability missing in his other roles; Biel looks lovely and has real spark; Statham's charisma and comic touch carry him through the worst of the script (even as his shiny brown toupee seriously lets him down); and Dane Cook has an amusing cameo as a party guest.

2534412,4,B000EU1Q7M,"I titled the review the way I did becuase the mvie does a good job at shedding new light on several of it's lead actors, and it does it in a way where you get to see range and depth not previously shown.

The movie at heart is a broken-love story. Guy has beautiful girl; guy loses said girl; guys spends majority of movie trying to convince himself and others the girl was the on for him. Not unfamiliar territory, but here it's done in a way that many teen/young adult dramas don't---they push some boundaries. From Jason Statham's character being into kinky sex to watching these good looking seemingly well menaing young adults snort coke like their lives depended on it--you definately don't feel like you're in ""another teen/young adult movie"" (some get the jest!).

At best, the movie is a character study. You get the background of the relationship between Syd and London. And, you get to see it's eventual demise in expertly edited flashbacks. You actually get pulled into their relationship and even feel for it as it plummets.

The supporting characters add the splshes of color needs to paint the story and make it more fulfilling than watching a couple bicker at each other.

It's not going to be everyone's cup of tea, as several monologues are a bit out there, and the coke snorting permeates the entire movie. However, if one can get past that some of the musings about religion and relationships are quite well written.

The whole movie is basically about how complicated love can be and is shown through the eyes of Syd and how his relationship slowly but undeniably fell apart with London. Most of the movie is shown in a bathroom but the issues talked about amongst Syd and Bateman were some of the most interesting things that I have heard. I have had discussions with my friends just like that and this is why I probably enjoyed the movie.  They discuss about God, Love, Life, Drugs, Sex, and many other unsolved mysteries that everyone on this planet in one way or another has a different view point on.  This movie teaches you that love in not like a fairy tale, it shows us that it is more like a roller coaster with ups and downs and if your not careful, it can get the better of you. One of the most realistic love stories that I have seen in a movie; at least out of my personal experiences; but the movie allows you to open your mind.

He converses with his dealer/friend Bateman (a seriously miscast Jason Statham, with what appears to be a seriously bad hairpiece) among others, as he ponders going downstairs to say his goodbyes to his beloved ex before she leaves town.  First off, it should be well noted that there is hardly anything edgy to be found with London, as it is mostly a showcase for the whining talents of Chris Evans.  Evans himself I don't mind, but the philosophical musings and ponderings, combined with the mountains of cocaine that are ingested during the film's running time (seriously, there's enough here to kill Tony Montana) just make London more annoying and boring than anything else.  The cast also features Joy Bryant, Isla Fisher, and comedians Dane Cook and Louis C.K. as well; but none of them really appear to do a whole lot with their screen time.

Thinking this movie would be as boring as all hell, and to be perfectly honest, buying it because of the names on the cover. And let's face--Jessica Biel...wow!

Boring was something this movie was not.

It's a love, a real world, backstreet love story. Sex, drugs and boos are part of the ultimate package.

Syd (Evans) is on the verge of self-destruction with drugs and boos, realizing his lost relationship with London (Biel) was harder on him than he thought it would be.

I've never seen Jessica Biel in such raw form; aside from the fantastic acting by the entire cast, the storyline written by director, Hunter Richards.

This is love on the breaking point of all breaking points.

Perhaps not as successful as ""Closer,"" another film that pushes taboos in interpersonal relationships, the chronic complaints of Syd did demand attention, even as they were annoying.  The film did a lot to highlight the range of Chris Evans.  From ""The Fantastic Four"" to ""Cellular,"" we've seen an action hero type who was hardly cerebral.  Here we see a disturbed young man, devastated by his breakup with the beautiful London, even as flashbacks reveal that his jealousy and behavior is what pushed her away.  Evans does about everything but stand on his head to explore the edgy neurotic psychological landscape of this loser.  While I didn't particularly enjoy the performance, I did appreciate that it was well done.  Evans teams with Jason Statham who was also in ""Cellular"" as well as the two ""Transporter"" films and ""Lock, Stock & 2 Smoking Barrels.""  As Bateman, a banker turning 40 who has sexual issues that stretch from the kinky to the lame, Statham gives one of his deepest performances also, cutting through the psychobabble and having some deep discussions about the existence of God.  Images of Buddha are placed throughout the party set apartment that for me reflected a peace that the main characters sought.  Jessica Biel who was in ""The Illusionist"" and ""Ulee's Gold"" does a good job as London.  We believably understand how she fell for bad boy Syd and how she'd like to move past the experience.  The attraction plays well on screen as they get together after Syd starts a brawl at the party.  Two cameo parts are also worthy of mention.  Kelli Garner who was in ""The Aviator"" and ""Man of the House"" gives a breezy performance as the blonde Maya who runs up to the bathroom for some lines and gets mired deep into a heavy conversation.  As the bartender Mallory who gets invited to the party and also links up with Bateman, Joy Bryant does a nice job.  She appeared in ""Antwone Fisher"" & ""Bobby"" and has a glowing presence on screen.  For a first time director, Hunter Fisher has taken chances.  What I liked is that he fully examined the depth of his characters, sacrificing plot for character study.  While aspects of the film are unpleasant, the performances and the boiling conflicts both within Syd and between the characters make ""London"" a good drama.

2534426,5,B000EU1Q7M,"I found London to be a fantastic film - gritty, intense, dramatic, and raw.  It sort of grabs you by the throat and throttles you every so often, never selling itself out for a single minute.  The story doesn't give you what you have come to expect, especially in terms of the ending, and I think that's a very encouraging sign for the future of Hollywood in this new century.  London has an inner fire that's almost palpable.  It's not a film everyone will enjoy, however.  Some viewers (especially older ones, I expect) just won't connect with it, and some will be turned away from the language and drug use it depicts.  Other will surely find it mesmerizing, so I say don't be afraid to take a chance with this film.

To be honest, I wasn't sure how I would react to this film.  Aside from the almost constant drug use among the characters, it's not exactly easy to get all that excited over a story that takes place, for the most part, inside a bathroom.  No plot summary can really describe this film, though, as its heart and soul boils down to emotions and characters.  London is all about love and the train wreck of a life it can leave in its wake.  Some may not think the film makes a great deal of sense, but when has love ever been about making sense or behaving rationally or living happily ever after?  This movie is real to the core.

The centerpiece of the story is Syd (Chris Evans), an emotional mess of a fellow who has a seemingly terminal case of love for his ex-girlfriend London (Jessica Biel).  He's just not capable of dealing with his loss, as therapy, cocaine, and booze just aren't doing the trick.  When he finds out that London is leaving the country to move in with some guy in L.A. and that he wasn't even invited to her going-away party, he really starts coming unglued.  Seeing this as his last chance to talk to London and try to get her back, he decides to show up at the party, anyway.  Along the way, he manages to drag Bateman (Jason Statham), his friendly neighborhood coke supplier, along with him.  They quickly make their way upstairs to the bathroom, and that is where Syd stays until such time as he can work up the gumption to go down and talk to London.  This bathroom, I should mention, is not your conventional bathroom - it's bigger than my first apartment, has plenty of windows with a great view of the city, and seems to be the perfect place for snorting cocaine and seriously hitting the bottle.

As Syd talks (and rants) to Bateman and a couple of female pals over the course of an hour or so, the nature of his relationship with London is revealed, along with some revelations on Bateman's part, as well.  The conversation between both of these men is oftentimes rather disgusting, but every part of it demands and deserves your attention.  I'm pretty sure Syd had to have been the worst boyfriend ever.  He certainly got little sympathy from me, as he's an incredibly needy, jealous, egotistical nuisance who constantly starts arguments over the least little thing - and he can't even bring himself to tell London he loves her.  Even putting his obvious drug problem aside, this guy was born with emotional problems.  Therefore, I see the film as something of an anti-romance; I certainly wasn't pulling for Syd to win London's heart in the end.  Bateman is actually the most compelling character in the film, largely due to a tremendous performance by Jason Statham.

London fully deserves its R rating for gratuitous drug use and strong language.  Several of the characters snort cocaine like it's going out of style, but I don't really buy into the notion that the film warns against the allure of such recreational drug use.  Obviously, no one wants to be like Syd, but the film certainly doesn't go out of its way to present any negative consequences of drug abuse - I found it pretty ambivalent in this regard, actually.

Basically, what we have here is an uncomfortably honest, edgy, intense film about love and loss and dealing with the emotional trauma these things oftentimes induce.  It doesn't march to the drum of conventional Hollywood scripts, it holds nothing back in terms of content, and it eschews anything resembling a storybook ending.

It also has some excellent supporting characters with some interesting stories.  My favorite is the main character's dealer, who is mentally scarred over losing his wife because of things that are beyond his control.

The movie makes you walk away with several things to think about.  First of all, you're not the only one who knows pain, everyone has their own story and your personal hell is no more painful than the next guy's.  Secondly, it shows you that whatever you're going through, chances are you're not going through it alone.  Sometimes you have to reach out to that other person so that they can hear you say I need you.  Or, I love you.

This movie begins when Syd (Chris Evans) attends the going-away party of ex-girlfriend London (Jessica Biel) at the home  of a friend (Isla Fisher).  Before arriving at the party, Syd stops to see a friendly bartender, Mallory (Joy Bryant),  Bateman (Jason Statham),the friendly local drug dealer.

London is a movie that was promoted as being a romantic love story.  In actuality, it is anything but.

2534433,3,B000EU1Q7M,"Hunter Richards makes his writing and directing debut with this quirky, odd, strenuous, frustrating, noisy...but pretty polished little low budget movie LONDON.  While this film will not garner a big audience, for those who see it there will be keen anticipation of Richards next outing.

London (Jessica Biel, a beautiful and talented screen presence) is a frustrated lover of Syd (Chris Evans, likewise a hunky and very fine actor): Syd is strung out on coke and though passionate as a lover he is unable to verbalize 'I love you' to fill London's needs for intimacy.  All of this information we receive trough flashbacks and dream sequences as the film takes place in one day - the day London is leaving after a farewell party in her honor.  Syd is self-destructive as well as actively aggressive, and while not invited to London's party, he crashes it with his dealer Bateman (Jason Statham, who sports hair here and an even more impressive acting outing).  The crux of the story takes place in an extended bathroom conversation during which time both men do lines of coke and swigs of tequila and compare notes: Syd bemoans his loss of London and his regrets while Bateman violently compares his loss of potency to be a far greater problem.  All manner of topics arise, not the least of which is Syd's atheism and his lack of belief in just about everything.  His sole reason for attending London's party is to win back her love, but coke and the shallowness of Syd's character prevent that.

Interesting situation, here: Evans, Biel, and Statham all give fine performances but their characters engender absolutely no empathy from the viewer. Perhaps this is Hunter Richards' concept: drugs destroy the minds of otherwise very strong people, that temporary highs prevent appreciation of the immediate matrix that can grow into something lasting and valuable.  Yes, the script is preachy and full of gross dialogue, but the underpinnings of good filmmaking are evident enough to make us aware that Hunter Richards has talent.  And it is always a pleasure to see actors heretofore accepted as eye candy prove they can take on beefy tough roles that stretch their acting abilities.

2534435,4,B000EU1Q7M,"London portrays an evening in the life of Syd (Chris Evans) as he attends the going-away party of his estranged ex-girlfriend London (Jessica Biel) in an attempt to reconcile their relationship. He meets the cocaine dealer Bateman (Jason Statham) before heading to the party and invites him along. The pair do line after line of coke in a bathroom and have conversations along typical hipster topics such as God, Sex, relationships, etc. while Syd musters the urge to join the party and confront London.

I thought the casting in this movie was fairly good; Statham is excellent as Bateman, and Joy Bryant proves to be an nice foil to his edginess. The two problems I had were with Chris Evans, and, minorly, with Isla Fisher as the party's hostess Becca. Evans has been typecast as an All-American good guy and it is difficult for me to see him shed that skin and take lines in a bathroom and swig tequila from the bottle. Fisher's affected British accent is downright awful, but she is a minor character.

Something that I think many (casual) viewers would miss is the thought put into the motifs and shots of each scene. Mirrors appear often (I think actually a quarter of the movie was shot at a mirror, rather than at the actors themselves); this represents the introspection of a cocaine high as well as the soul-searching that follows a failed relationship. Also, the party loft and the bathroom specifically feature religious statues and art everywhere, echoing the philosophic conversations.

Hunter Richards and Jo Willems, the director and cinematographer, respectively, did a great job of staving away the claustrophobic feeling of being in one room (the restroom) for most of the film. The many shots break up the scene while not being too choppy, and flashbacks are melded fairly seamlessly. The lighting maitains the tone, especially in scenes in the bathroom and Syd's apartment.

I think the one big problem that many people have with this film is that the topics in Syd's conversation with Bateman seem too cliche. That is the case in some instances; if you do recreational drugs with others, you may have a feeling of deja vu, especially during the ""God"" philosophical discussion. This is where Statham saves the movie with his deeply personal anecdotes and revelation about his fictional wife, ""Heather.""

Overall, I think this is a respectable first film for writer/directer Hunter Richards.",1148688000,8,2412,4.96039603960396

""Yes,"" rejoined Cosby, ""but what if you're an asshole?""

""London"" is a 2005 film from first time writer-director Hunter Richards that is about just such a person, Syd (Chris Evans).  After having sex with his girlfriend, London (Jessica Biel), Syd wakes up to find that she has left him, not just in the sense of being gone but it that she has moved out and moved on.  Syd does not take this well and trashes the apartment (when was the last time a giant aquarium survived in a movie?).  London is going to be at a going away party for her thrown by a girlfriend, to which he has not been invited, but Syd shows up and hides out in the bathroom in order to screw his courage to the sticking point.  He meets Bateman (Jason Statham) at a bar, and drags him along for moral support.  In the bathroom they discuss everything that pops into the heads, although a lot of Syd's topics go back to London and invite your standard flashbacks.  Sometime some of the women from the party going on downstairs, Mallory (Joy Bryant) and Maya (Keli Garner), pop into the bathroom and join the conversation, not that this helps raise the intellectual level of the discourse all that much, stories about experiments involving shooting newborn bunnies aside.

The only problem is that we do not really care about the conversation, or the people, or the relationship between Syd and London.  Yes, there are scenes in which Biel is semi-nude, not that you can see anything, but that is hardly a reason to recommend a film.  People keep saying that Syd has his good side, but it certainly does not appear during the long scenes in the bathroom.  We understand what he sees in London since, after all, she is played by Jessica Biel, but there is no apparent reason for affection to go in the opposite direction and the end of this film just adds insult to injury.",1148515200,,2200,4.536708860759494
