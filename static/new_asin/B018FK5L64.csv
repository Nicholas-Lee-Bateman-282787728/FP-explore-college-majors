7545635,4,B018FK5L64,"A well-crafted thriller that has a lot more going on than what's on the surface. Themes of love, betrayal, hypocrisy, trust, insecurity, loyalty and especially envy are scattered throughout. The filmmakers behind this also wrote and produced the underseen gem RUDDERLESS, William H.Macy's directorial debut, and they're amassing an impressive pedigree so far. Jason Wiles is a standout as the cocky co-worker. Derek Phillips and Cameron Richardson also deliver strong performances.",1453161600,3,481,5.788732394366197
8742240,2,B018FK5L64,"Hate is a strong word so I'll just say that I didn't like it-- I realized then I truly dislike flashbacks b/c the story-telling often becomes too nonlinear; I was never able to get through ""Inception"" for this reason after 4 attempts even though I like all the actors in the movie. I don't go to movie theaters anymore because I'm forced to stay in my seat---I like to pause things when my attention drifts. I have a short attention-span for confusing or convoluted story lines. I like me some Jason Wiles so that was the one good thing about this movie.",1530576000,,554,4.4411764705882355

8742242,2,B018FK5L64,"sorry.  I found this dull, plodding and slow.  yes.  I missed parts because I was distracted by someone snoring.  me.  let sleeping dogs lie.  this was not good.",1529625600,,161,4.571428571428571
8742243,1,B018FK5L64,This could potentially have been a good movie.  Wound up being a complete dud ending.,1528070400,,85,4.666666666666667
8742244,4,B018FK5L64,Not the best movie but I was intrigued to keep watching.  I do believe this is how a schizophrenic person view the world. Extremely Paranoid.  Then I realize no one was chasing him and he is and was the killer.  Like I said Interesting,1527724800,,235,4.295454545454546
8742245,1,B018FK5L64,Boring and stupid.!,1527638400,,19,5.666666666666667
8742246,1,B018FK5L64,"A total waste of 72 minutes, this movie has this guy having flashbacks from past and future, if you don't pay attention or walk away for a second you will miss something that will confuse you even more....Maybe walking away is a good idea.....",1527465600,2,243,4.545454545454546
8742247,4,B018FK5L64,it has some writing flaws but is better than most recently-made movies i watch - good acting throughout,1526601600,,103,4.777777777777778
8742248,1,B018FK5L64,"This movie is a complete waste of time and money.  This movie is 72 minutes long, but will bore the living daylights out of you.  I'm pretty sure this movie is about bad business between friends, but don't really know because it flashes back and forth so often that you lose track of what's going on and you could care less.",1471824000,5,324,4.295081967213115
8742249,5,B018FK5L64,"Well done for an independent film, will keep an eye out for others from them.",1469923200,,77,4.2
