2738537,5,B000MQ5534,"The president of an unnamed western republic is shot dead at a public event and his supposed assassin is found dead a short while later.  An investigation concludes that the president was killed by a lunatic who subsequently shot himself.  Only one man disputes this conclusion, a public prosecutor named Henry Volney.  Suspecting a cover-up, he takes charge of a new investigation to discover the truth...
Inspired by the assassination of John F. Kennedy in 1963, I... comme Icare is an absorbing but somewhat superficial political thriller, very typical of the neo-polar genre in French cinema of the late 1970s.  At a time when the French people were disillusioned with right-wing politics and were increasingly suspicious of the activities of their security services, films like this were very popular, although they naturally helped to fuel the sense of paranoia and mistrust which was rife in the country.",1212796800,,911,5.1768707482993195
2738538,5,B000MQ5534,"Un film policier exceptionnel, politique, tellement bien jou&eacute; par Montand en pleine forme.
Yves Montand joue le rle d'un procureur qui reprend une enqute sur l'assassinat d'un homme politique. Tr&egrave;s largement inspir&eacute; par l'assassinat de JF Kennedy. avec une fin dramatique. Un excellent supense.

Il y a surtout une sc&egrave;ne particuli&egrave;rement forte, celle tir&eacute;e de l'exp&eacute;rience faite aux USA par Stanley Milgram.

A voir et &agrave; revoir !",1212019200,2,485,6.117647058823529
2738539,5,B000MQ5534,"This is a kind of movie that many watch but a few can really SEE what is the more important. The more important is that the movie shows experiments that indicate how far a normal person can go if he/she is blindly obedient to someone in power. It is part of explanation, for instance, for the nazi soldiers obedience to nonsense and criminal Hitler's demands. Good to be seen by educators.",1211414400,,389,4.492957746478873
2738540,1,B000MQ5534,"I watched this movie while back and since then I always wanted to get it on DVD, this DVD quality is good, but there is no English audio or subtitles!!
It is not written anywhere in the product details that it has only French language, so if you don't know French don't buy it, it is a waste of money.",1202688000,8,301,4.033333333333333
2738541,4,B000MQ5534,"Yves Montand plays a prosecutor who is in charge of investigating the assassination of the president. What looked at first glance like the work of a lone madman soon turns out to be much more.

This movie is very well written. It is a work of fiction but it is also very much inspired by the death of President Kennedy. The plot is full of twists and turns while remaining plausible and logical.

Yves Montand was one of the best actors of his generation and gave one of his trademark performances.

The movie was entirely filmed in France yet has an American flair to it. It was mostly shot in suburban Paris. Outdoor locations feature high rise towers and modern architecture, as opposed to the typical villages and historical monuments often seen in French movies.",1200528000,3,767,4.666666666666667
2738542,5,B000MQ5534,"This movie, long before Oliver Stone's JFK, tells the story of an investigation, the investigation of a president being murdered the JFK way.
Yves Montand is a DA utterly commited to his job(he's the Jim Garrisson of this movie).
Telling more about this movie would already be too much...watch it ! (and then, watch it again !)",1192924800,2,327,4.754385964912281

8170752,5,B000MQ5534,"Once one gets over the obvious reference to JFK's murder in Dallas, the movie is a thriller of the good guys trying to nab the bad guys and failing at it.  Montand gave credence to an interesting role, that of civil servant trying to do his job without assistance from the powers that be.  The overly dramatic ending was redeemed by the reference to Greek mythology, which is,in effect, the theme of the movie: those that try to reach beyond their abilities end tragically.  Montand's character is the Icarus that tried to reach where he was not supposed to.",1352246400,,558,4.616161616161616

8170754,5,B000MQ5534,"Excellent film.
Je confirme l'avis de Daniel Dzierzgowski :
- dvd difficile  trouver en France ou alors  des prix excessifs.
- le dvd achet sur ce site fonctionne parfaitement sur un lecteur zone 2.

8170756,5,B000MQ5534,"I saw this movie many years ago at the theater and I remember being fascinated by it. I recently tried to find it in Paris and after visiting many stores selling both new and used DVDs a store manager told me it was never made into a DVD (At least in France anyway)! I checked on amazon to see if someone is selling it used and to my great surprise I found the canadian version brand new and shrink-wrapped! No english subtitles but I would recommend it anyway. If you do not know french find someone who does and watch it with them. You will not be disappointed. Unlike other 70s movies which hold a better memory than they actually are, this movie is even better than I remember.",1244073600,,681,4.286821705426356
