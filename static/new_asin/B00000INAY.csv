7911119,4,B00000INAY,Jay Jay and his friends teach many valuable life lessons on all of their tapes.  This episode teaches about doing for yourself.  My son loves all of the Jay Jay series.  You will not find action heros on these tapes but your child will find heros and good lessons.,973987200,5,264,4.346938775510204
7911120,2,B00000INAY,"I got several Jay Jay videos from the library where I work, expecting a cute show for my kids.  Instead, I found that they are all pretty stupid!  Some of the episodes try to teach a good lesson, but the plotlines are misguided and lame.
On this tape, Herky the helicopter is afraid of being ridiculed by the airplanes and so teaches himself to dance in private.  This and other dumb stories make this a barely watchable video by kids and adults alike.",972000000,,452,4.421686746987952
