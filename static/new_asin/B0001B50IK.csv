8389156,5,B0001B50IK,"Baby Road Trip Beach keeps my 11 month old daughter's attention with its vivid colors and fun songs.  I don't feel guilty leaving her in front of the television while Baby Road Trip is playing because she is amused by the different animals.  I can hear her laughing from the other room...especially when ""Road Trip Ryan"" comes on.  She even holds the DVD cover through the show.
Also, we've been traveling a lot with my daughter and I found the traveling tips on the websight very helpful.  Thanks Baby Road Trip!",1077753600,,513,4.604395604395604
8389157,5,B0001B50IK,"I have bought this VHS for a gift for three of my mommy friends.  ALL of them have called to thank me for it. Seems their kids can't get enough of it and it helps them free up time guilt-free as it's fun and educational to watch.  (My god-daughter asks for her ""beach"" everyday. I just bought her Jungle too, so I'll let you know how that one rates with her!)",1077235200,,359,4.042253521126761
8389158,5,B0001B50IK,"I ordered Baby Road Trip Beach for my two sons (ages 16 mos and 3 1/2 years) hoping it would entertain them both.  BINGO - this fun DVD does the trick: they gave it the toddler rave review: AGAIN, AGAIN! My little guy loves to move to the happy reggae music.  My older son also enjoys naming all the beach toys and the counting.  Even I was fascinated by the animal images - really unique stuff that's cool to watch.
A great gift for anyone with little kids.",1077062400,,458,4.181818181818182
8389159,5,B0001B50IK,"WOW! I after I bought this for my grandson and watched it myself I went and purchased 4 more for the rest of the kids in the family. The music is great, the scenery is colorful and it teaches in the most simple ways. Very entertaining!",1076976000,,235,4.130434782608695
8389160,5,B0001B50IK,"Finally - someone was thinking of the mommies and daddies as well when they made this video.  My 12 month old son just adores Baby Road Trip BEACH.  It is truly a unique video with upbeat music, bright colors, and adorable children, all of which keep my son smiling, laughing, and clapping.  I also gave this as a gift to my best friend's daughter, who just loves it.  She dances and runs around the house singing the theme song.  I have just placed an order for JUNGLE and cannot wait to receive it.  Thanks again Baby Road Trip.",1076889600,,530,4.357142857142857
8389161,5,B0001B50IK,"This is the best childs video I have purchased to date.  My son sits in front of the TV mesmerized.  It gives me plenty of time to get things done around the house (i.e. vacuuming, dusting, cooking etc...).  Not only is this video entertaining it is also educational.  Thanks Baby Road Trip!!!",1076889600,,293,4.576923076923077
8389162,5,B0001B50IK,"Baby Road Trip Beach is refreshing!!!  I was so tired of the same old videos--and so was my 14 month old son.  He loves the bright colors and loves to dance to the funky rhythym of the music (which, by the way, moms, you won't mind having stuck in your head!) Wonderful to watch with the baby, but also allows me to do some cleaning, pay bills, etc. while he is entertained, too.  Can't wait to get my hands on Baby Road Trip Jungle!!!!",1076716800,,436,4.166666666666667
8389163,5,B0001B50IK,"My 2 year old was captivated.  I thought he would be, thats why I got it. What surprised me was how much I loved it. I'm not quite sure how Baby Road Trip came up with such a wonderful video but they did. We just ordered the Jungle video and can't wait to get it. KEEP THEM COMING BABY ROAD TRIP!!!!",1075161600,2,299,3.901639344262295
