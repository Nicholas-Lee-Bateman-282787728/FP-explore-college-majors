I have a relatively small space to display and have ended up placing my houses more or less in a row hiding the wires as best I could. This DVD showed how to vary the height of my houses by using styrofoam ledges, which can be done in a small space. I was also pleased to find that using the tools to carve the styrofoam was really as easy as demonstrated. There are advertisements about the Place & Plug system, which can be skipped over if you're not interested. I like the idea of using the cord and the plugs but will probably use my own light cords. With this display all the wires are hidden so it really doesn't matter how many wires there are.",1204070400,3,719,4.217391304347826
8004027,1,B0000W65NY,"This is basically a 30 minute commerical for the Place and Plug strips.  It shows how to create one temporary and one permanent base out of styrofoam... and that is it.  There are no techniques or display suggestions given at all.  The focus of the video is about ""how great the Place and Plug strips are to use,"" and ""how the cords are more easily hidden when you use the Place and Plug strips.""

I guess I just paid a lot of money to watch a commercial.",1197590400,2,455,4.195402298850575
8004028,2,B0000W65NY,This DVD is great for showing you how to build the bases of your village but does NOT give or show great detail on the assembling of your village.  The Village Vignettes DVD is a much more detailed DVD!!!,1128556800,3,204,4.230769230769231
