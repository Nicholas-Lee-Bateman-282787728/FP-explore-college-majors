8550973,2,B00AFLSOWU,This movie has a+ acting and story. Not really. I got it because my brother is an extra in it. But overall it's a pretty lame movie.,1437177600,,132,3.925925925925926
8550974,5,B00AFLSOWU,"Anyone with half a brain knows that Tetherball is an awesome movie.  Great quality, great camera scenes and angles.  5 stars, thumbs Up!  Great job guys!",1365811200,,153,4.8076923076923075
8550975,5,B00AFLSOWU,"Art is a very subjective thing, but I also like movies that make good on their promises. This film features a great story (well great for a booze and boobs comedy!), I personally love underdog stories, and they definitely pulled this one off.

Forewarning before buying this... if you don't like Low-Budget Films, then this movie won't be for you. But if you do like low budget films... then you are in for a treat!

Ron Jeremy quite possibly had his best NON-ADULT performance in this film... I always hate films where the Homosexual Character plays it OVERLY FLAMBOYANT, Ron played it very cool, calm, and CREEPY. You couldn't ask for a better villain.

Dustin Diamond has about 8-10 minutes of screen time in the movie. He plays the ""Down-on-his-luck"" Trainer in this film... and I must say, KUDOS. I don't want to give too much away, but he STILL HAS IT. Very funny performance, in a way that most people aren't used to seeing him.

Last but not least, I enjoyed the acting from the four lead characters in the film. They had perfect chemistry and pulled off the Juvenile Jokes with CLASS... I can definitely see them being in bigger films down the road, as they reminded me of a young Broken Lizard.

Overall, if you like scantily clad ladies, Nut Slapping Humor, reminiscent memories of playing Tetherball... then you are going to want to see this film!",1363219200,,1359,4.645833333333333
8550976,2,B00AFLSOWU,"This movie gets two stars because of the naughty, delicious women/girls in the movie that was worth watching. The filmmaker knew exactly what he was doing in that capacity. In fact, that was the only reason why I watched the whole movie. The other necessities of the movie that are primary of climbing the star-rated-scale, meaning the script, acting, direction, and cinematography were not to be taken seriously. It obviously wasn't meant to be impressive due to the limited budget.",1363046400,,483,5.05
