8545788,5,B009ZTQNMG,"During the Jewish holiday of Hanukkah, the activity department at the assisted living where I work was looking for an interesting educational program featuring Hanukkah for our residents, most of whom are non-Jewish. We showed this DVD, and our residents found it to be interesting and very informative. Because it depicts the ART of Hanukkah, we were able to recruit residents to come to the program who were generally interested in art but not necessarily familiar with Hanukkah. While watching the DVD they learned a lot about both art and Hanukkah.

I highly recommend this DVD to nursing homes and assisted living facilities who are looking to incorporate interesting cultural programs into their activity programming at minimal cost.",1355616000,,739,5.262711864406779
8545789,5,B009ZTQNMG,"This new video reviews the history and meaning of Hanukkah through objects of art. Most people are familiar with the Hanukkah rituals. What is not common knowledge, however, is the historical development of the holiday. Using a combination of media (paintings, sculpture, woodblock prints, etc.) the dvd helps us gain an appreciation for how Hanukkah customs evolved, and which themes and ideas have emerged over the centuries. While some have mistakenly called Hanukkah ""the Jewish Christmas"" this impressive parade of artwork reinforces the fact that Hanukkah stands on its own as a powerful, meaningful Jewish holiday. Finally, the dvd shows how Judaism has inspired various art forms over the century. For some, the arts are a ""way in"" to Jewish identity and commitment. I believe this dvd will help many viewers find meaning and inspiration.",1354579200,,846,5.274074074074074
8545790,5,B009ZTQNMG,"This DVD provides a good educational introduction to the art of the Jewish holiday of Hanukkah. The central artistic object of the holiday is the Hanukkah lamp, and over the ages attractive lamps were created in various techniques and materials in the many lands and cultural environments were Jews resided - reflecting local styles, motifs and designs in the service of the Jewish ritual. The informative DVD presents a selection of choice lamps, highlighting especially modern Hanukkah lamps, and provides enlightening explanations of the designs and their meanings.",1353110400,,568,5.465909090909091
