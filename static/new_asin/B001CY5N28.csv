3520646,4,B001CY5N28,"Speed Racer: The Next Generation - The Fast Track is the second DVD release of Speed Racer:The Next Generation. It contains three episodes of the popular show to make up this DVD movie. The story this go-round starts with Zile Zazic's lab technician, Joel. He lets Zile take over the virtual track during the Redwood Rally. Zile has plans to mess up the race for Speed and kill him. Speed, being as smart as he is, mananges to figure out he's being done in and manages to survive the race. Speed decides to investigate the matter in the virtual track, with the help of Conor and Lucy. Unfortunately, the technician has implanted a virus in the virtual track, trapping Speed, his Mach 6 and Annalise Zazic. Speed and Annalise are forced to work together in order to survive, as the virus eats up the track. Conor and Lucy try to help but Conor accidentally loads the original Speed Racer enemy files and both are faced with the Mammoth Car and the X3. After they escape the track,  the Mammoth Car, X3 enter the real world. To which, Annalise turns to Speed for help.

Extras include ""The Animation of Speed Racer: The Next Generation"" &  ""Sneak Peek w/ Jeff Gordon"". One looks at how the show is created while the next has Jeff talking about how he grew up watching the original series, his racing history and about how it felt to lend a voice to Speed Racer: The Next Generation.

Overall, I really enjoyed this movie. Alot more so than the previous one. As I've said before, it probably won't appeal to fans of the original series but it will sure appeal to the younger set. Check it out!!!",1236816000,5,1592,4.498269896193771

Now I get the whole computer generated thing and I am fine with it but don't get too caught up with the whole total electronic thing, we will lose something for sure. Moving on, I liked Speed Jr. and his team and I guess too that the Spridle who is the school principal is the old spridle?  I am guessing a lot. The addition of ""X"" whatever his capacity is, is a good one. Now X's girlfriend is the spoiled rich girl that hates Speed and everything to do with him, I can live without this character...and why would X date this girl? No redeeming qualities. I liked it but didn't like this.....you have to figure it out!",1516752000,,734,4.280575539568345
