6161711,3,B00HFC90TI,The plot was everywhere and the protagonist was shifted to 2nd lead. There were alot of questions and subplots that were never finished or answered. The art was beautiful and overall it was really good.,1411084800,2,202,4.8

6161716,2,B00HFC90TI,I`ll admit that I didn`t watch this set all the way to the end. After watching part 1 I was disappointed as well though I wanted to see if it would get better but it didn`t. Since this series was done by the same people that did Steins gate I had high expectations. In my opinion this was too good so I didn`t finish this set because I have so many other series wait to be watched I no longer will finish series it the writing of the show dosen`t cut it. Watch Steins gate instead of this.,1403308800,2,489,4.0
6161717,5,B00HFC90TI,So I just finished the full series last night and if there's anything I have to say it is a really great series. I am not the biggest anime buff but 5pb have created some very interesting stories so I decided to check this one out and Robotics notes is not a disappointment. The main story revolves around Kai and Aki two young high school students that want to build a giant robot from an anime that Aki liked when she was a kid (she's to only one really fired up to be honest) and along the way they get more club members while realizing the reality of making a giant robot. The real meat of the story has to do with a giant conspiracy that I won't spoil for you here. To put it generally the story is strong the characters are likeable and relatable. All in all do yourself a favor get part 1 and part 2 part 1 admittedly drags but part 2 moves pretty fast and its a great adventure.,1400371200,13,886,4.097701149425287
6161718,5,B00HFC90TI,"Haven't finish watching the whole show yet, but I'm about halfway done with part 2. So far it been a very good show it have a little bit of romance and a lot of mystery and drama. I do think the $60 price tag is little too high, but luckily i got my copy for $45 from a third party seller on amazon. It's definitely worth the $45 and I would recommend to buying this show if you into mystery.",1399334400,4,392,3.9125

8632430,5,B00HFC90TI,I thought the story got a lot more involved amd endearing in this second half of the series.,1453852800,,92,4.166666666666667
8632431,5,B00HFC90TI,"Robotics Notes Part 2 is still a great show but it focuses more on the mystery/conspiracy plot-line that was not executed as well as it could have been. Nevertheless, it is good series to watch from start to finish.

On a side note a lot of people say they did not like Robotics;Notes because it was not like Steins;Gate, unfortunately people fail to understand that Robotics;Notes was never a sequel to Steins;Gate to begin with. I feel most people had their expectations way too high from the previous show to not let Robotics;Notes stand on its own merits. I will be the first to admit that one of Robotics;Notes major flaws was the pacing issues between the ""building a robot"" slice of life side and the mystery/conspiracy plot, nevertheless it is a pleasant show to watch and one of my personal favorites.",1445817600,,810,4.704225352112676

8632435,3,B00HFC90TI,"2nd half is the weakest part story-wise.
Has a tragic scene that rivals anything from its predecessors. This alone makes that episode worth watching.

 If you haven't seen Steins;Gate, then watch that instead. This is comparable to Chaos;Head in that the later portion of it quickly becomes meh.
Source material, aka the visual novel this is based on may be significantly better overall (like the in the case of Chaos;Head) so that might be a better choice to partake in alternatively.

Overall I had immediate 2nd thoughts on this purchase partway through (I normally only buy content that I've viewed before) and would likely not have bought/viewed again (aside from the one scene mentioned above). Ultimately disappointing though not actually bad.",1422921600,,750,5.181818181818182
