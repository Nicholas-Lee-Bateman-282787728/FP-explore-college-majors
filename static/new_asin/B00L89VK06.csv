8664261,3,B00L89VK06,"Was kind of disappointed in this doc.  I was expecting it was 120 minutes long, it was only about 45 minutes long.  Maybe 120 minutes with the bonus features.  The doc. was also scattered, no real rhyme or reason to it's format.  It's not a timeline of the story, from beginning to end, it's scattered and not in any kind of time order.  Nice to see, but not worth the $ it cost.",1442361600,5,379,4.136986301369863
8664262,1,B00L89VK06,"This is a bad documentary. Someone got their hands on some Casablanca promos, interviewed some peripheral persons and cut it up. Nothing in it to make it worth your time or money.",1409875200,,179,4.625
