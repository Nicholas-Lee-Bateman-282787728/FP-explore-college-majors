8163402,5,B000LPS4EI,Oh my goodness gracious this was hilarious. There's something to be said for a film that predates and predicts the bronism that came shortly thereafter.,1451174400,,152,5.12
8163403,1,B000LPS4EI,"This movie makes no sense. Why are the bronies eating people? I'm confused.

Seriously, this film has no discernible plot or structure. It is neither scary, nor funny, which kind of kills it as a horror-comedy. Poorly shot and lit throughout. The special effects are what I would describe as 'half-assed'. Even the pony masks are really poorly done, and those are more convincing than the gore.

I was hoping for so-bad-its-good, but this film is just bad. So sad.

On the bright side, the mockumentary/found footage aspect is very inconsistently used, and the less of those tropes we see in horror, the better.",1450051200,,611,4.855769230769231
8163404,5,B000LPS4EI,"I think this is a classic example of brilliance on a low-budget. The real draw here is actress Irina Peligrad.  NOt only is she a world class beauty in the same league as Megan Fox and Annalyne McCord, but she can act and steals this movie.  If she ever moves up to A-list films, Fox and and McCord better watch out for the new kid in town. If you read this Irina, I think yer totally hot and awesome and wish you much happiness and success in life.",1263340800,2,449,4.090909090909091
8163405,3,B000LPS4EI,"Pony Trouble! (Warren Lynch, 2005)

In the larger set of ""every movie ever made"", there is a subset of movies that I can only call ""transcendentally bad"", those movies that are so gut-churningly horrible that they achieve a kind of greatness. Then, within that larger set of ""transcendentally bad movies"", there is a much, much smaller subset of ""train wreck movies"", which augment the general badness with a sense of weird that makes you wonder what on earth it is you're watching, and how anyone came up with this madness, but from which you cannt tear your eyes away once you have begun watching. In general, they're the movies about which Joaquin Phoenix's character's immortal line from 8MM applies: ""once you've seen it, you can't unsee it."" (Such a bad movie, but such a great line.) They are movies that, as you're watching them, will take a small piece of your sanity. You will never see it again. And of the movies of this type I've seen, none so deftly personifies the concept of the train-wreck movie as Pony Trouble!. I mean, come on, it starts off with a girl of indeterminate age wearing a cutoff T-shirt and panties beating on a tied-up care bear in a fluffy girly bed. And after that, it starts getting weird. No, really.

Cindy (Melinda Desiree Frye) is a devotee of the Pony Game, a LARP (for those of you who aren't gamers, the acronym stands for ""live-action role playing""; like Dungeons and Dragons, but getting dressed up in actual armor and swinging wooden practice swords at others who are dressed up like orcs) of the near future that, from what we get to see of the game itself, is like some sort of combination of Rainbow Brite and Vampire: The Masquerade put together by someone who was overdosing on heavy psychedelics. As we open, Cindy finds out that she's won a ""why I love the Pony Game"" essay contest sponsored by Megatoy, the game's publisher. She immediately informs her compatriots in their LARP circle, and they get together to celebrate. We quickly discover that the Pony Game is not, for these folks, just a pastime (did you ever see the Tom Hanks flick Mazes and Monsters, based on the Rona Jaffe novel of the same name? Well, let me put it this way--how Tom Hanks was at the end of that movie? That's the beginning for these folks). However, Donna (Irina Peligrad) is rooted enough in reality to be a big fan of TV, and when she finds out that Cindy and her group are going to be getting air time, she starts hatching a plan to make sure she and her ditzy sidekick Barbara (Bethany Lawler) get as much exposure as possible. Now, this is just the main plot; there are side plots aplenty, and those are where most of the real deviance of this movie creeps in. They don't necessarily have to be there to make the movie go forward, but they are instrumental in making this thing the absolute freakfest it is.

It's pretty obvious that Lynch and co-writer Gabriel Boyer are big, big fans of CSI. Yeah, if you watch the show, I'm sure you remember the live-action Pony Game episode as well. Everything about this movie says that Lynch and Boyer were enchanted with the idea and wanted to see how far they could take it. I just wish I'd thought of it first. As a movie, if you go into it expecting high-quality production values, top-notch acting, perfect special effects, and the like, you're bound to be disappointed; this has the look of a movie that was made for the money they found between the cushions of the couch. To me, that's not necessarily a drawback, as some of the better movies I've seen over the past few years have come out of the indie grindhouses. And while I'm certainly not going to call Pony Trouble! a good movie by any stretch of the imagination, I have to give the writers points for coming up with something that's so far left of not only center, but of what's commonly considered left. I mean, this thing is out there. And I don't have the words to explain how weird this thing actually gets; you'll have to see it for yourself. Let me put it this way: this is a great example of the absurdity of drawing something out to its logical conclusion and then going five or ten steps beyond. And every time you think it's gone as low as it can go, rest assured it will find another step. And, honestly, I defy you to find anything weirder in the past ten years of film than the Nicey Nicey song. I am in awe. ***",1233964800,,4370,4.473684210526316
