2009058,5,B0001KNHGS,"I saw this film a couple years ago at a film festival and thought is was hilarious. Always wondered what happened to it, because I was sure some studio would pick it up. Glad to see that the general public can now discover this gem. The other reviewer is right: Gaffigan is great. You want to hate him for being such a nimrod, but there's a quality about him that makes him endearing, too. A great mixture of real humor and real touching moments. Hint: Listen very carefully to the lyrics of Tommy's ""French"" serenade. It make all those years of high school French worth it!",1087171200,,574,4.4245283018867925
2009059,4,B0001KNHGS,"Anyone who liked Jim Gaffigan on David Letterman last night should check out this film. Instead of getting three minutes on national TV, Gaffigan gets 85 minutes in this film, and he never wears out his welcome. The supporting cast around Gaffigan is great, too, especially T.J. Jagodowski as his ""normal"" friend. The film is surprisingly well-written and well-acted, given what appears to be a shoe string budget. I found the director's commentary interesting, too. As an aspiring filmmaker myself, I found it sort of inspirational to hear everything the directors went through to make this film; their tales are a vivid reminder that these days pretty much anyone with enough moxie can go out and make a feature-length film. It's a pity film like No Sleep remain unknown while the studios keep pumping out drivel.",1086998400,4,815,5.0

8013684,1,B0001KNHGS,this is not like his current stuff; we couldn't even stand to make it through the first 1/2 hr,1406332800,,94,4.0
8013685,3,B0001KNHGS,"good movie, kind of slow moving. also jim not his funny self. but if you played hockey as a kid you can relate.",1393718400,,111,3.869565217391304
8013686,4,B0001KNHGS,"If you appreciate Yooper humor or anything about the pure game of high school and college hockey, Jim Gaffigns humor will leave you wanting more.",1359676800,,145,4.84
8013687,2,B0001KNHGS,Jim Gaffigan is a really good comedian.  I recommend Beyond the Pale highly.  This probably would have been more interesting to me if I had been part of the Hockey culture.,1323907200,,172,4.516129032258065
8013688,5,B0001KNHGS,"wow. greatness gave it 3 out of 5 then rambled on about the title.

I'll give it 5.

I'm buying it. I hope it's as good as I say.

'til next time.",1238371200,,146,3.5
8013689,3,B0001KNHGS,"I found the quality of the writing quite uneven.  Whereas I usually love Jim's stand-up comedy, the filmmakers' apathy is visible even in the title to ward off prospective viewers.  ""We couldn't think of a way to add actual colloquialism, so we sloppily used the pseudo-colloquial, unnecessary abbreviation we saw in the Taco Bell commercial.""  ""We failed Elementary School English, thus don't know the simple word till.""  ""We were so busy on the other aspects of the movie that we couldn't be bothered by coming up with a decent title.""  I don't hold the low budget against them, just the apathy.

Rating: Entertaining enough for a non-hockey fan to see once.",1185062400,6,660,4.900900900900901
8013690,3,B0001KNHGS,"I ordered the movie as a gift and when I received it, when you moved the DVD case, you'd hear the DVD inside clang around.  I called Amazon and returned it for another one, but the same thing happened. I think it may just be something with the manufacturer and its way of packaging.

Also, while the movie is funny (as all of Jim's stuff is), the movie quality is very poor.  It almost looks like someone just made it at home in their basement and printout out liner for the dvd case.",1168473600,2,484,4.182795698924731
8013691,5,B0001KNHGS,"I saw this movie at the Ashland Film Festival with a sold-out crowd and they went wild -- as well they should have. This is a terrific little movie, with lots of laughes, great characters and a big, big heart. The fact that the movie never broke through to a wider audience is more the fault of the movie distribution system, which doesn't know how to handle or promote gems such as this. Buy it, rent it, watch it. You won't be disappointed.",1159833600,2,442,4.337349397590361
8013692,3,B0001KNHGS,"I think Jim Gaffigan is hilarious and I am a huge fan of his stand-up material.  This film, although it is quirky and funny, did not properly showcase the full range his comedic talents. He doesn't really ""cut loose"" in this role, as you might imagine he would.  It's an extremely low budget production, which is cool, but the story could have been played-out better.  It has its moments, but it's not quite what I was expecting.  Perhaps I would have enjoyed it more if I were a hockey fan.",1141948800,,491,4.4222222222222225
