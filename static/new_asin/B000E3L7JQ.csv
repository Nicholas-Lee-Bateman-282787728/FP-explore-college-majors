8105140,2,B000E3L7JQ,I find this portrayal almost comical it is so over done. Techniques in film and staging have become so sophisticated that thiis DVD is horribly dated and exceptionally dull. I would not spend any time with it.,1391040000,,209,4.675675675675675

8105142,5,B000E3L7JQ,"I listened to the Audio Book of this title a few months before buying the DVD, I was enthralled.  When looking for a DVD I saw several with varying actors.  Reading the feedback on Amazon helped me to choose this BBC 4hour version.  I am thrilled as I watch one episode of 30 minutes each night before dinner.
This is one DVD I don't want to end!  I am halfway at present, pondering it during the daytime, such excitement.
Charles Dickens new so much about people.",1304899200,,464,4.3604651162790695
8105143,5,B000E3L7JQ,"I have seen two other versions of this Dickens tale--one version starring Ustinov, the other Jacobi, and they both suffer in comparison to this (1979 BBC production.)  Even though is was filmed in 1979 I was surprised to see how well it held up, and the transfer to DVD by Koch is excellent.

The acting was superb, and Little Nell looked as if Dickens had chosen her himself. Mr. Quilp looked perfectly evil, and comedic at the same time.

You won't be sorry if you buy this version.",1279411200,15,484,4.4772727272727275
8105144,5,B000E3L7JQ,"This offbeat Victorian tale of a mad half pint shylock and his stalked shopkeeper debt victims grows on you despite the popularity of more epic Dickens novels set in worldly locales. And for big drama translated to small screens, there is no overplaying in Boz's whimsical realm. Most every character must be played to the hilt to do justice to the original prose. So much so that good support helps the black hat wear the show.

For a beloved yet overlooked classic, there are several adaptions of this and counting, another one out due this summer. All of them collectable to see who does the best job of portraying the dastardly Quilp. Look no further. Master Trevor Peacock even has the gait down. Moreover, no other version ever captured the picaresque combination of melodramatic dread, serial comedy and forlorn heartbreak like this early BBC effort.

The only subtle touch it is missing is a narrative host intro like when it was first aired on PBS. And the only other actor who can compare with Peacock's scene chewing stealth was the spot on fellow who portrayed Sam Brass in the Ustinov version. In a day and age where we're all potential victims of debt without the prison, there's a lot of plot to hit home and entertain us here. And it's more old world real than new reality TV.

This miniseries was must see TV for high school English lit way back when. It retains a lot of the colorful character atmosphere of classic Dickens, is literally faithful (almost word for word) and not without comic relief in the worst laid plans of Quilp. Critics who fail to see that the main antagonist was the funniest of all Dickens miser villains and not a garden variety scoundrel, misread a comi-tragic masterpiece.",1238630400,16,1717,4.716666666666667
8105145,2,B000E3L7JQ,"This adaptation of Charles Dickens' The Old Curiosity Shop should have been a success. It was supplied by a first-rate cast including Trevor Peacock as ""Mr Quilp,"" Sebastian Shaw as ""Grandfather"" and one of my favorite character actors, Colin Jeavons as ""Sampson Brass."" All of them are impeccably trained and from the looks of things, this film looked as if they plucked these actors right off the stage and starting filming. The director probably would've had a big success if he scrapped this film and made this a touring stage play. The actors mannerisms were too big for this production, especially those of Mr Quilp. He was marvelous but he acted like he was playing to an audience of five hundred, rather than doing intimate camera work. I hate to say it, but there's a host of other problems with this production like the awkward staging and the poor direction. Most of the scenes fell flat merely because of how they were filmed. Also, the screenwriting unfortunately left out two, rather necessary components: suspense and danger. Nell and her Grandfather are fleeing from a rather sinister businessman who means to collect his debts from the Grandfather and make Nell his wife. He's chasing them for heaven's sakes-shouldn't there be some uneasiness, the feeling that these people should constantly be looking over their shoulder?? We should fear Mr. Quilp just as we would Mr. Tulkinghorn, a character in another Dickens masterpiece ""Bleak House."" Obviously, we know Mr Quip won't succeed in his quest, but we have to at least believe that he might. The poor quality of this series is evident in the first few minutes, but I at least wanted to give the actors respect by watching the rest of it-otherwise I would've turned it off. I would recommend this version for the performances only, it was a disappointment otherwise.",1229904000,6,1835,4.922580645161291
