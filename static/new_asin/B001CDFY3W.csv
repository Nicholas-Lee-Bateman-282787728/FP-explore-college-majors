8286988,5,B001CDFY3W,"I am a big Michael Madsen fan. I purchased this DVD for my collection. The movie is a little slow with the plot. However, the plot is very intriguing and has some interesting twists in it. The lighting is a bit dark at times, but I feel it actually adds to the mystery of the movie. It was very unusual to see Daryl Hannah to play such a part, but she did an excellent job! And of course, Michael Madsen is Michael, and I just enjoy watching him. As I have said in some of my other reviews, if every movie was ""produced and directly"" perfectly, they would be boring, and rather robotic at times. This film is neither. Oh, and I love the car Michael drives in this movie!!",1443225600,,671,4.1692307692307695

8286991,3,B001CDFY3W,"This film was actually a very pleasant suprise considering the very predictable title and the obvious fact that this is one in a line of many direct to dvd B-films of this sort. Considering this and the obvious very low budget, this movie turned out to be a way better than average crime thriller. The most interesting item here is Michael Madsen's performance, which is actually sometimes very good and even near the end- ""touchingly emotional and heart felt"". He comes off through the major portion of the film in typical baddass fashion, but none the less there are some very good moments where he truly does an unusually excellent and respectable job. Daryl Hannah was very good as well playing her character rather shyly passive, and she looked wonderful with her short dark hair. Over all the film was truly great with good lighting, unique locations, spot-on acting by the entire cast, gritty mystery and intrigue, solid direction and plenty of well executed moments of violence. This film loosely seemed similar in quality and atmosphere as NARC did. That film about police corruption featured Jason Patrick and Ray Liota in the lead roles. Over all VICE is really very well done, and I am glad I took the time to see it. I have seen a lot of weak or even terrible B-films Michael has done, but I'm pleased that as B-films go this is one of the better ones of this genre, and Madsen fans will be very pleased.",1367884800,,1417,4.649402390438247
8286992,3,B001CDFY3W,"Decent movie, not one of the best but its good anyways. Its up to you if i want to check it if you like but i would not totally recommended this one",1347753600,,148,3.65625
8286993,2,B001CDFY3W,"Very gritty thriller, with very chauvanistic, almost anti-women attitudes on display. It trawls the depths of depravity and inhumanity in an area where drugs and despair are common place and where it is hard to tell the good guys from the bad.

The movie stinks of corruption and dishonesty. In a way it is the wild west allover again where the colour of a person's skin does not matter where drugs, prostitution and death hold sway.

I am reminded of the King of New York and New Jack City but this film does not come close to either. It is disturbing on several levels especially as one contemplates the movie after watching it. There is an attempt to make the film a hoodunit but close following of the plot leads the serious viewer to guilty party identification relatively quickly. Darryl Hannah does not do the part justice really as it does not call for much and she is heavily over-qualified.

I find the self-examining narration superfluous and depressing, leaving this reviewer wondering why anyone watching would need it.

This has the germs of a good idea in it but the film does not allow them to grow into the movie it ought to be.",1224547200,4,1145,4.598039215686274
