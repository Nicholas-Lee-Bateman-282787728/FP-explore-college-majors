He was very young and it doesn't really sound like him, but it was funny and the Kung Fu is great.  The scenes of the cat fending off the snake was a little out of order, but it didn't distrupt the movie.

1711329,3,B00006672Q,"This is an early Jackie Chan movie before he became ""Jackie Chan""; in fact the name Jackie Chan only appears on the DVD container and not in the actual film credits. Snake in the Eagles Shadow takes a familiar martial arts movie premise (one style/system against another) and adds enough twists, action and humor to pull the plot up from average to very good.

Although the story and acting make this a very good movie, this Beverly Wilshire Filmworks release appears to be nothing more than a VHS to DVD transfer. The video clarity is weak to acceptable and it is a shame that someone has not bought the rights to the original print and made a high quality DVD.

If you have seen the complete movie before it is all here for the most part, however the scene with the cat and snake has been greatly truncated probably due to animal cruelty laws. There is just enough of the scene left in to forward the plot but it would be nice to have the complete movie.

Lastly, I gave the movie three stars because of the poor video/image quality. If this had been a high quality DVD I would have given this four to five stars because this is one of my favorites.",1298592000,2,1151,4.369158878504673

The imprint on the disc itself was that of  Jackie Chan, though. The packaging and label of the DVD itself is dubious, akin to pirated dvds you buy from the sidewalks or alleys.

1711336,5,B00006672Q,"Snake in the Eagle's Shadow 1978 - 5/5
Cast: Jackie Chan, Simon Yuen Sui Tin, Hwang Jang Lee, Roy Horan
Director: Yuen Woo Ping
Producer: Chen Chuan
Writer: Ng See-Yuen (producer of Drunken Master)

Everyone smokes Opium-(a brownish gummy extract from the unripe seed pods of the opium poppy that contains several highly addictive narcotic alkaloid substances, for example, morphine and codeine.) The Beggar so(Simon Yuen Sui Tin) Which is Yuen Woo Ping Father smokes it. Jackie Chans Master at his schools smokes it, as well as People on the street. Well the script written was based on the story created by Jackie Chan is good. It's so good in facts it's probable, in my opinion ,better than the other famous collaboration between Yuen Woo Ping and Jackie Chan(Drunken Master). The movie starts with Jackie Chan knowing nothing about kung Fu. He was the clean up boy in his master school of martial arts. One day he's walking and helps in old man escape from a fight. This old man is the legendary Simon Yuen Sui Tin who is the last surviving expert of the Snake Fist Style of Kung Fu. The master of the other style ,Eagles Claw, wants to kill all the remaining members of Snake Fist style. After stating that he has all ready killed 3,000 members he kills another, until there's only one left. Simon Yuen Sui Tin teaches the style to Jackie. This is a quote from Jackie Chan about his favorite lines in the movie ""My favorite lines in the movie comes when I am using my newly learned snake fist against my opponent : my character shouts ""I'm a poisonous snake"" then gives him a quick punch to the groin and says :""That's called finding the snake.""

Well Jackie figures out how to combine a fighting style beggar so taught him and a style he witness his cat using. In which he sees his cat fighting a cobra. It was a real cat fighting a real cobra! He names it Snake fist in Cats paw. The old master doesn't like it so they change it to Snake in the Eagle's Shadow. Hence the Title.",1198800000,,1984,4.4930747922437675

1711343,3,B00006672Q,"This is a decent flick of Jackie Chan's early stuff. Jackie had a good share of unsuccessful films with Lo Wei, because he didn't use Jackie Chan to the fullest. Lo also tried to make Jackie Chan another Bruce Lee. But this is his Jackie's first collaboration with Yuen Woo Ping (the choreographer from The Matrix triology, Kill Bill Volumes 1 & 2, Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, and Unleased), and he introduced Jackie to the genre of kung-fu comedy.

This DVD (the Columbian Tristar version) is the second-best version out there. This version, however, cuts out a brief fight between a cat and a snake (this fight scene is important to the plot). To get the full story, buy the Mei Ah version, or the Hong Kong version.",1139443200,8,721,4.6328125

1711345,5,B00006672Q,"Before I go on I must say that my score is based on a heavy tilt.  As a DVD this has nothing to really merit 5 stars in the way of features, extras and the ilk. But you're not buying this movie for features are you?  You're buying it because this happens to be one of the finest Kung Fu movies ever made.

There is a plot that revolves around two feuding kung fu schools, the snakefist and the eagle's claw.  The eagle's claw has all but won, having successfully killed most of the members of the snakefist.  Jackie Chan plays an errand boy working in a small kung-fu school and he happens to come across the last remaining master of the snake fist and provides him out with food and shelter.

That's the plot.  Its full of holes but at the same time it is dotted with some hilarious moments, highlighted by excellent fighting scenes, and carried by jackie chan's irresistable charm.

This is old school jackie chan.  If you've only seen his new films you will most likely not like this.  For people who really enjoy his older work or want to see a classic jackie chan film, this is amongst the best.  I also recommend police story which is another jackie chan classic.",1093737600,11,1169,4.3657407407407405

1711361,4,B00006672Q,"Rival Kung Fu schools are fighting over honor and proof of superiority. An old man, who has mastered a particular kung fu style (Snake Fist), comes to town, only to find a young protagonist (Chan) who is at the bottom of the food chain. The master teaches the young man to defend himself. However, when the evil master comes back to town to kill all who use Snake Fist, our young protagonist may need more than one technique to defend his life.
I've always liked this movie, but as I grow older, I come to realise just how rediculous the whole thing is. Some of the comedy situations are cheesy and dumb, detracting from the plot of the story. There are also quite a few plot holes (which I cannot discuss without including spoilers).
However, the action is excellent. Jackie Chan does some of his best work in this film. The fighting scenes have excellent choreography, and play out more like spectacular dances than fights. Yuen Woo-Ping wisely chose to use long cuts of the overall action, rather than resort to fast close-ups where the actual status of the fight is barely coherent.
Video: I used to rent an old VHS version of this film, and it contained a strange flaw: At various points in the film, the tint of the picture would suddenly change. It would start off normal, then switch to a yellow tint about half of the way through, and then switch to a red tint toward the end. Thankfully, the new DVD version contains no such error. However, I did notice one slight flaw: at two points in the film, I noticed small rainbow-colored lines running across the screen, as you might see on an old VHS tape. However, they weren't too much of a distraction, and only lasted a few seconds.
Audio: As with most old kung-fu movies, the English dubbing is very bad, but this actually adds to the enjoyment of the movie; it's so bad that it's good. You also have the option to watch the movie with its original Cantonese language track and English subtitles. Take note that the Cantonese track seems to have suffered some deterioration, because it is much quieter than the English track.
The sound effects are also laughably bad. They mostly resemble sounds that you could make by blowing into a microphone. You will either get used to them or hate them.
The music is interesting, but sometimes seems misplaced. Also. the ""surprise"" music cue is used, reused, and used again until you know every note by heart.
The recording quality of the music is poor; most of it sounds distorted.
Extras: The only extra feature on this DVD isn't even a real feature: three movie trailers (none of them having anything to do with Jackie Chan movies). Two of the trailers are for anime flicks, and the other one is for Jet Li's ""The One.""
Do not buy this DVD if you are expecting extras. Do not buy this movie if you can't handle loose plot and bad sound. BE SURE to buy this movie if you have any interest in excellent kung-fu fighting.

1711362,1,B00006672Q,"It was good to see that Columbia/TriStar pictures had released the 2 movie dvd edition of Jackie Chan's classics. I watched Snake in the Eagle's Shadow since I was a young boy. I remembered watching it many times. This was back in the early 80s. Now watching it again is a delight.
Though, a very important part of the film was cut. This changed the tone of the film since it is the pivot of the storyline. The story was about how Jackie Chan learned the Snake Style from the old beggar, who is the master of the Snake Style. However, a vicious martial art opponent with an Eagle style was determined to wipe out the Snake Style clan. Chan didn't know this was going, and the old beggar was on the run, to escape from the Eagle Style master. Through the middle part of the story, Chan discovered that the Snake style manual that was left to him was torn apart by his cat. He found his cat trapped in a corner of the room confronted by a cobra snake. In the original film, it actually revealed how the cat won the fight against the cobra, with agility and the speed of its claw. The snake failed in its offensive attempts, and in the end the cat killed it. This scene brought an important revelation to Jackie that he could integrate the cat fighting system into his current Snake fighting style. The scene is pivotal because he saw how the cat avoided and faught back the snake. This I believe, is not only important for the film, but also for the audience, who can see logically how Jackie would adapt such style. The fight between the cat and the snake was omitted, where we could only see the confrontation of the snake and the cat, and the next cut was the snake dying on the floor with the cat next to it. I am not sure whether this only happens in the region 4 version, but I suspect its a standard cut. This totally throw me out of the exciting experience of watching the movie since it didn't match the original film. I can't make any sense out of why Columbia/TriStar would want to  cut the scene. It degrades the experience of watching a classic movie such as this one.
I would recommend finding another version if possible, released in Hong Kong perhaps.",1056844800,24,2165,4.358910891089109

1711364,5,B00006672Q,This film is Jackie's first comedy/action film. Jackie plays as a poor boy who works at a kung fu school and his only friend is his cat. Jackie doesn't know any kung fu but that doesn't stop the guys at the school from trying their moves on Jackie. One day Jackie rescues an old man who was being bullied by the mean-spirited students of the rival Eagle Claw school. It turns out that the old man is the last living master of the Snake Fist Style and he agrees to teach Jackie. Unfrotunately the evil Eagle Claw master is on a mission to wipe out the snake fist style so he plans to kill both Jackie and the old man.,1037059200,,616,4.141666666666667
1711365,5,B00006672Q,"This movie's story is pretty simple Shang Kwan Yi Mun (Hwang Jang Lee)is the eagle claw master who has decided to wipe out everyone who knows the Snake Fist technique. After having killed almost every snake fist master there is now only one left Pak Cheung Tien (Simon Yuen). But what he doesn't expect is that Pak Cheung Tien will teach the poor orphan boy Chien Fu (Jackie Chan) the snake fist style. Now Chien Fu has to under go some of the most tortuous training ever devised. On the way he also learns another style ""the cat's claw"" which he learns from a cat that kills a king cobra snake. Chien Fu now decides to combine the snake's fist with the cat's claw to be able to beat Shang Kwan Yi Mun in the final confrontation. This movie is a pretty stunning showcase and the first time Jackie Chan got to show what he is able to perform. Simon Yuen shines as the old snake fist master. Hwang Jang Lee also makes a solid performance as the dreaded eagles claw master. What can I say this movie is a classic. Anyone interested in Jackie Chan's kung fu movies Snake in the Eagle's  Shadow, and Drunken Master is the ones to get too. See Yuen founder of Seasonal Films saw his chance when he managed to get director Lo Wei to loan out Jackie Chan for 2 movies. Although many people had told him that it was a major risk to have Jackie Chan as the star after all the awful movie's he had made in the past with Lo Wei who tried to position Jackie Chan as the next Bruce Lee which was a very bad idea. This movie just can't fail the fight scenes are brilliant especially for the time they were made. Although the production on this movie seems this One of the Best and was typical for all Hong Kong movies ever made at the time. This is the movie that gave Jackie Chan the recognition to be a Star, and soon to be a Super Star. I am a Big Jackie Chan Fan, and I am telling you if you like Jackie Chan Movies this movie (Snake in The Eagle's Shadow) is a must have. How, is because of the out sanding action that Jackie Chan and Master Hwang Jang Lee display in this great movie. Also it has some funny stuff in it movie. This is a great movie. So if you like Jackie Chan Movies Snake in The Eagle's Shadow, and Drunken Master is a must have to your collection. So I hope you injoy this movie.",1021939200,7,2289,4.155405405405405

7961672,4,B00006672Q,"Jackie Chan was a star in China long before he was recognized for his talents in the US. His first attempt to break out here, THE BIG BRAWL, did well but nothing like the box office he was doing in Asia. Parts in both CANNONBALL RUN films helped but still no ignition. Then came RUMBLE IN THE BRONX and his star here began to rise. It made fans look into Chan and seek out his earlier films that were so huge in his home country. Unfortunately most were terrible copies with washed out footage and terrible dubbing. Fans can rejoice as two of those films make their way to blu-ray courtesy of Twilight Time.

SNAKE IN EAGLES SHADOW features Chan as Chien Fu, a young man working as a janitor at a local kung fu academy. Picked on by the students and ridiculed by the teacher, he trains himself but not well. An old man, secretly a kung fu master, sees whats going on and takes it upon himself to train Chien in the snake fist style. While this is going on, the leader of the Eagle Claw clan is in search of the old man in an attempt to end the teaching of this style. Eventually Chien faces off against him and loses. Rather than accept defeat, he begins to find a way to counter the Eagle Claw style his enemy uses with one he creates himself.

The movie offers a story that runs through much of the classic martial arts films, a student in need, a willing teacher who helps him overcome his issues and a climactic battle between the good guys and the bad guys. Tossed into the mix is a bit of humor more slapstick than verbal that displays the acrobatic styles of those involved. It all makes for a fun film for fans and an easy one to watch for those unexposed.

The second film here is DRUNKEN MASTER, a movie that was a box office hit in China and that made Chan a star. This time around hes Wong Fei-Hung a brash young kung fu student whose father owns the school he trains in. Disobedient and far too cocky, he father bans him from their home and sends him to his uncle Beggar So to train. Their paths cross when Wong tries to con his way out of Beggars meal not realizing who he is.

Beggar reveals himself afterwards and begins to teach Wong his style of fighting. Taking his time to move him slowly to the level he needs to reach, he still has issues with Wongs attitude. Eventually he begins to train him in his special style known as 8-Drunken Genii kung-fu. The style incorporates the motions of a drunk and to reach this point it helps to actually be completely intoxicated. At the same time there is a method to his madness.

As the training progresses the head of a rival kung fu clan creates problems for Wongs father. He steals his students and disrespects his school. With a new style of fighting it appears he will bring the school to an end. Only Wong can save the day but he must first master the techniques hes being taught and reconcile with his father first.

The movie reunited Chan with Siu Tin Yuen in the roles of student and teacher. While his character here was less sympathetic than in the previous film the eventual turn makes up for that. Combining the martial arts with acrobatic skills as well as a generous dollop of humor, especially in the drunken fighting style, the movie is a perfect example of martial arts films from the time.

Chan fans will be delighted to won this great presentation of both films. Twilight Time has brought a great looking presentation of both. Extras include isolated music & effects tracks and Drunken Master audio commentary with film historians Ric Meyers and Jeff Yang. As with all Twilight Time releases it is limited to just 3,000 copies so if you're a fan pick one up today.",1505001600,,3647,4.378138847858198
