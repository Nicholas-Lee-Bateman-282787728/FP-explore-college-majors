3127890,5,B0014B7PQQ,"This is one of the best comeday/drama series to come out of Britain. I have seen several episodes on PBS but there is nothing like having the DVDs to watch at your leisure. Great actors, great writing and excellent stories make for an entertaining hour of TV. The show has a serious side but the focus is on the very subtle comedy this four people convey on screen. There is a very good chemistry among the characters and they are all unique. The ladies man, the neurotic, the wise old ""leader"" and the excellent Detective Superintendetn Pullman. If you are a fan of British comedies or light police procedurals then you will love this series. I just wish the DVDs were released more quickly to the USA. Great show.",1265932800,26,715,4.550387596899225

3127892,5,B0014B7PQQ,"My husband and I really enjoyed season one and preordered season two on Amazon.  We were not disappointed and as a matter of fact, found this series even better than the first. A female police officer has been disgraced and sent to run a cold case unit.  She is able to bring on board some retired police detectives to help her as consultants. The batch she is finally able to persuade to join her are some very quirky former and now retired coppers.  The chemistry between the actors is very good and the mysteries are well plotted.  This is a 'light' set of mysteries. The second season allows for further character development which only increases the viewer's pleasure. This series is highly recommended.

3127900,5,B0014B7PQQ,"Big fish, unidentified body parts found in a forest, wild boars, celebrity cooks, crooks, missing diamonds, and cold cases are all part of the second season of 'New Tricks,' a highly entertaining, if somewhat quirky, British detective series featuring a team of retired detectives and their boss, a female police superintendent who had been on a fast track until she shot a dog during a hostage rescue.
Sound like fun?
It is.
'New Tricks' is one of the longest-running detective shows on British television and with good reason: It mixes humor with pathos, triumph with tragedy and its cast is top flight. In this second season of the hit series the Unsolved Crimes and Open Cases Squad gets a new deputy commissioner to butt bureaucratic heads with and he is no treat. Smart, politically astute and well connected Deputy Commissioner Robert Strickland is determined to keep the team on budget and forces it to handle some cases that will advance his career in addition to closing the files on some old crimes. He may have met his match in Superintendent Sandra Pullman, however, the team's leader: Tough, career oriented and a top investigator in her own right, she has enough trouble riding herd on her three ""dinosaurs"" without Strickland's meddling and she's not afraid to fight back when the occasion demands.
  The series stars Amanda Redman as Pullman, James Bolam as her one-time mentor and former boss Jack Halford, the marvelous Alun Armstrong as the flawed genius Brian Lane and Dennis Waterman as Gerry Standing, a slightly dodgy ex-cop with a penchant for breaking the rules when it helps him solve a case. Anthony Calf as Strickland has the right look and the right attitude to step into the role as the new Deputy Commissioner. Together, they constitute an ensemble cast that has kept New Tricks on top of the ratings pile for close to a decade.
  If you are a fan of British mystery programs, you'll enjoy this season of New Tricks because the dialogue is snappy, the cases the team tackles are interesting and the direction is seamless.
  I highly recommend it.",1427846400,,2078,4.8559322033898304
3127901,5,B0014B7PQQ,"This is a fun show, with great acting and sometimes some silly antics.  I love the concept of retired detectives working cold cases.  It not only has crime solving, but it attacks the subject of aging and marriage very well.  Lots of unresolved issues are examined in everyone's private lives.  It is a pleasant change from other crime shows, in that you get a few laughs along the way.",1425168000,,386,4.550724637681159

The mysteries are good but for me it's the cast, like the Wizard of OZ, the tin man, the scarecrow, and the lion.  She fits Dorthy to a tee.

Reviews of New Tricks caught my eye and I ordered the first three seasons.  There are plenty of reviews out there that go into detail about the series so I won't repeat those.  I have been pleasantly entertained with the comedy that keeps me laughing.  I also like the fact that since these four people are trying to solve cold cases, there is very little gore and mayhem.  It's really not needed to keep things moving along.  I had planned to not order another season, but there is such a cliff-hanger at the end of the third season that I had to order the fourth and look forward to seeing the result.",1363046400,,755,4.427536231884058

3127945,5,B0014B7PQQ,"Whoever came up with the idea for New Tricks was a genius. Whoever came up with the casting was a genius x 2. The result is Britain's most popular drama series.

In Season 2, the UCOS (Unsolved Crime and Open Case) squad is really beginning to hit its stride. The stories are imaginative, the mysteries satisfying, but the main charm of the series is in the characters. There's detail-obsessed Brian, cheery cockney Gerry, wise old Jack and their boss, smart, tough Sandra, all adding their strengths to the solving of each crime. Along with the drama, there's lots of humor and a good deal of nose-thumbing at authority.

Recruiting veteran actors for this project was a major brain-wave. James Bolam (Jack), Alun Armstrong (Brian) and Dennis Waterman (Gerry) have all appeared many times on British TV, but never to better advantage than they appear here. They play off each other brilliantly and seem to be having a great time in each other's company. In this series, Amanda Redman (Sandra) loosens up a bit and joins the old reprobates in their crafty undermining of the system and subtle mockery of their strait-laced head of department, Deputy Assistant Commissioner Strickland. The camaraderie of the group, the funny lines and the unorthodox approach they bring to crime-solving all add up to a wonderfully original series.

Thoroughly recommended.",1339200000,,1356,5.044642857142857
3127946,5,B0014B7PQQ,"My husband and i are ""punk/skaters"" and yet we LOVE this show. Rarely is anything this funny and great made in America! It's very easy to care about these characters, you root for them, and laugh with them. A++",1335916800,,210,4.410256410256411
3127947,1,B0014B7PQQ,"After carefully reading the reviews and noting that some of them said this series was ""family friendly"" I ordered the second season because it cost the least.  Today we watched about 15 minutes of the first episode of the 2nd season and not less than 6 times there was foul language, men peeing in the men's room, very unpleasant innuendos that I suppose were suppose to be funny and a man who had a sex change.  Fifteen minutes was all we could take and thus we are out the money paid for a ""family friendly"" series.",1329004800,2,517,4.375
3127948,5,B0014B7PQQ,"I absolutely adore this show.  I have watched all the seasons.  The most recent concluded in the Fall of 2011. It is about three senior citizens policemen in the UK who are recruited to return to the force to solve cold cases.  They work under a younger woman who was demoted to this job after a dog got killed in a police raid she led.  She became a pariah to the public and had to be buried in this department.

I have really come to love the characters and none more than our nerdy one, played by Alan Armstrong, who is a font of information. He is also a super computer nerd and his long suffering wife Hester has become as great a character as he is.  Next up is Jerry, played by Dennis Waterman.  He is also hilarious as a senior copper who still draws the ladies.  He also has a retinue of ex wives who all dine with him regularly en masse. Quite good are the other two, Jack and the woman head.

The mysteries are secondary to all of this.  They do solve them and they are interesting.  However, it is their peculiar interaction with suspects, witnesses, one another and police superiors which makes this compulsively watchable.  This is more of a comedy than a crime show although they do get the job done.

Our local PBS station broadcasts the series but I am not able to see all the episodes and have not seen them repeated. This is so much more convenient and I am able to see all the shows.,1322956800,,253,3.980392156862745
3127950,5,B0014B7PQQ,"In Season Two we begin to see the characters, Sandra, played by Amanda Redman, Gerry, played by Dennis Waterman, Brian, played by Alun Armstrong, and Jack, played by James Bolam, beginning to develop into the characters they'll become later on. Some of the exploration of just who the characters will be is past and the characterizations are stabilizing. It was very obvious in Season 1 that the cast would be going through a period of character refinement.

I was introduced to this series watching some of the much later shows and it has been interesting watching these seasoned actors refine their parts; they are really and truly good at what they do! We were interested to note that the theme song, ""it's Alright,"" is actually sung by Dennis Waterman who plays the part of Gerry Standing. While on the subject of versatility I must mention Alun Armstrong's peerless performance as the Innkeeper in the 10th Anniversary Production of Les Miserables, what a talent!

The depth of experience these British actors bring to their roles always amazes me; this excellent series is the direct result of their rich talent and extensive experience in British theater.

I recommend this series enthusiastically!",1322265600,6,1205,5.045226130653266
3127951,5,B0014B7PQQ,"This series was recommended by a fellow Amazon reviewer when I mentioned that I loved Inspector Morse.  We are just about finished watching Season 2 now and are looking forward to continuing with this very fun series.

I think this concept particularly appeals to our demographic.  Let's just say the younger generation might not be particularly enthralled with a bunch of late-middle-aged guys and a slightly younger and much hotter female boss, working cold cases and getting into just enough trouble to entertain themselves and the viewer but not quite enough to get the unit shut down - it's a very fine line and they dance it nimbly.

We particularly enjoy the growing chemistry among the detectives.  In the first season they emerged as a group of not particularly ingratiating sad sacks with somewhat tarnished pasts.  They were good cops with different skill sets, and they all wanted to continue to make a contribution.  In Season Two we get more of them interacting, starting to enjoy each other's company, and actually taking care of each other.  So, although we are laughing a lot, there are some genuinely touching moments.

Then there is the ambitious young Deputy Assistant Commissioner who clearly has aspirations of greater glory.  Mostly our heroes are getting into scrapes and using unorthodox measures that end up making him look bad, so he is constantly threatening to shut them down.  We know, of course, that won't happen, because there is Seasons 3, 4, 5, etc., but it's fun watching him sputter and get red in the face.

Amanda Redman does a great job of riding herd over the detectives.  She has an incident from her own past (very funny) that put the brakes on her career.  Running UCOS is pretty much her last chance.  Through most of Season One she had an air of quiet desperation, but by Season Two she cares pretty passionately about her guys and their quest and goes to great lengths to defend their out-of-the-box approach.  She tries to have a personal life, not very successfully.

Basically this is a fun, intelligent detective series with an unusual and interesting group of characters at its center.  It keeps getting better.  It's entertaining and relatively uncomplicated - just the thing for a Friday night video date with my spouse.  Highly recommended.",1320624000,,2295,4.911688311688311

Count how many times this happens in a single minute.  In the 1950s, I read recently, the average single camera shot lasted more than 23 seconds.  By 2007, the number was down to 2.7 seconds, apparently to rouse teenies who play computer games and expect fast viewing.  This film simply blinded us.

Great acting, all the actors not only can act, they have timing so that the humor is truly humorous - you don't need a laugh track to tip you off that something was said that is supposed to be funny. The writing is exceptional - I hate that so many U.S. shows (and now more and more U.K. programs corrupted by us) have simply godawful writing - hoping that talented actors can pull something out of a hat - you need both good writing and acting and if you want both, see each and every episode of New Tricks.

I've now finished both series 1 and 2 and am anxiously awaiting Series 3 - to be released on 2/22/11 in the US. I think of this band of retired British police officers (led by the smart and sexy - and sometimes paranoid - female detective) as my friends. The actors are superb. And the twists and turns in the story keep it fresh.

If you are reading this review, you have probably already seen Series 1. Series 2 is just as great. A bit shorter as there is no pilot episode.

The TOP BOS has changed too. Not Sandra - but the Police Chief (or whatever his title is). I'm not as thrilled with the new guy. No personality. But he's rarely in a scene. A lot less about Sandra's personal life this time (and her hair color (black roots) seems to strangely vary from light to dark even within an episode. But this is not a complaint. The guys get funnier all the time.

Oh yes, read the credits. Three well known British actresses from the 1970s show up in three different episodes. You'd never recognize them if you hadn't read their names. Rita Tushingham is the social worker in Episode 5 and Jane Asher (Paul McCartney's girlfriend for five years) is a wealthy animal breeder in Episode 8. The real surprise for me was the one time incredibly sexy James Bond girl Honor Blackman as a celebrity TV chef in Episode 4.

If you haven't found this series before - start with Series 1. Then get this one next.

You won't be disappointed.

It is about a woman Metropolitan Police supervisor, who is a rising star in the department, but due to no real fault of hers, she is sidetracked into UCOS.  A brand new unit to solve cold cases, but she will be the only active police officer in the squad.  Her squad is to be retired detectives. The characters are all played beautifully.  The various cases run the gamut, and it combines beautiful humor, with the true frustrations found in police work.  The cases and the trails to discovery are well done and believable.  A really enjoyable series.  The only flaw is we have 22 episode per season in most of our programs, and they have 9.",1292630400,2,685,4.432

Also, they are distorting the aspect ratio for recent broadcasts (not sure if that is an accident or an attempt to make recordings unpleasant.) Much better to watch the dvd as desired.

Not sure about this item title on Amazon - ""New Tricks: Season Two (2009)""  What does the '2009' mean?  These episodes originally aired in 2005.  These Region 1 (US format) dvds were released in Jan. 2010.  Maybe '2009' was the year of release for the UK Region 2 dvd?",1289692800,,615,4.545454545454546

But most of all it has CHARACTERS. Each is distinctive with the human flaws that make you take them to your heart and root for them to overcome the 'bad guys'. The idea of putting three retired cops with different strengths under a female leader is priceless and makes for witty repartee while also keeping each man on his toes with his fellow workers. The mystery plots are well done and you don't have the 'cookie cutter' actors and actresses like you have here in the U.S.A.

In fact few brit shows last over a three series so this one is doing very well. And there's a good reason for this the characters are believable and you really get to know them as the show progresses.
And there's always alot of humour in this show , just like the great first season in fact few shows can maintain such a steady mix of humour and drama and do it this well.  The cast is also first rate with the gorgeous amanda redman leading the ucos squad each ep.  Like all brit shows this show does feature a few stories about gays and transexuals , which is fine but some homophobes probably won't like those few eps. Usually in these eps they go on about the past injustice to these groups which is a fact and that's not debated.  I watched three episodes at a time when viewing this and time just flew by!  That's how good this show is and it's great to see seniors in the lead spots doing it right and vital.  This show could easily be a hit show over here. The dvd looks as good as series one did and that is another bonus about watching this show because it's a recent series with top notch film production.",1280534400,2,1247,4.170833333333333

This, along with hilarious acting and writing, avoid boredom and bring American audiences a more sophisticated and entertaining crime dramedy. I'm American and love Law & Order and The Closer, but I really treasure New Tricks. The actors are such quality actors - you never feel an episode is drawn out or boring - they end all too quickly. I can't stop chuckling at seeing all four of them (supervisor included) on their hands and knees, searching for the curse jar to retrieve their booty, with a door opening behind Jerry and shoving him fully onto the floor with a muttered expletive. Hysterical - you never feel you're watching actors. In this series we also gain more insight into the officers' personal lives, adding another serious and sometimes funny dimension to the series.

The batch she is finally able to persuade to join her are some very quirky former and now retired coppers.  The chemistry between the actors is very good and the mysteries are well plotted.

3362397,5,B0014B7PQQ,"Big fish, unidentified body parts found in a forest, wild boars, celebrity cooks, crooks, missing diamonds, and cold cases are all part of the second season of 'New Tricks,' a highly entertaining, if somewhat quirky, British detective series featuring a team of retired detectives and their boss, a female police superintendent who had been on a fast track until she shot a dog during a hostage rescue.
Sound like fun?
It is.
'New Tricks' is one of the longest-running detective shows on British television and with good reason: It mixes humor with pathos, triumph with tragedy and its cast is top flight. In this second season of the hit series the Unsolved Crimes and Open Cases Squad gets a new deputy commissioner to butt bureaucratic heads with and he is no treat. Smart, politically astute and well connected Deputy Commissioner Robert Strickland is determined to keep the team on budget and forces it to handle some cases that will advance his career in addition to closing the files on some old crimes. He may have met his match in Superintendent Sandra Pullman, however, the team's leader: Tough, career oriented and a top investigator in her own right, she has enough trouble riding herd on her three ""dinosaurs"" without Strickland's meddling and she's not afraid to fight back when the occasion demands.
  The series stars Amanda Redman as Pullman, James Bolam as her one-time mentor and former boss Jack Halford, the marvelous Alun Armstrong as the flawed genius Brian Lane and Dennis Waterman as Gerry Standing, a slightly dodgy ex-cop with a penchant for breaking the rules when it helps him solve a case. Anthony Calf as Strickland has the right look and the right attitude to step into the role as the new Deputy Commissioner. Together, they constitute an ensemble cast that has kept New Tricks on top of the ratings pile for close to a decade.
  If you are a fan of British mystery programs, you'll enjoy this season of New Tricks because the dialogue is snappy, the cases the team tackles are interesting and the direction is seamless.
  I highly recommend it.",1427846400,,2078,4.8559322033898304

3362442,5,B0014B7PQQ,"Whoever came up with the idea for New Tricks was a genius. Whoever came up with the casting was a genius x 2. The result is Britain's most popular drama series.

In Season 2, the UCOS (Unsolved Crime and Open Case) squad is really beginning to hit its stride. The stories are imaginative, the mysteries satisfying, but the main charm of the series is in the characters. There's detail-obsessed Brian, cheery cockney Gerry, wise old Jack and their boss, smart, tough Sandra, all adding their strengths to the solving of each crime. Along with the drama, there's lots of humor and a good deal of nose-thumbing at authority.

Recruiting veteran actors for this project was a major brain-wave. James Bolam (Jack), Alun Armstrong (Brian) and Dennis Waterman (Gerry) have all appeared many times on British TV, but never to better advantage than they appear here. They play off each other brilliantly and seem to be having a great time in each other's company. In this series, Amanda Redman (Sandra) loosens up a bit and joins the old reprobates in their crafty undermining of the system and subtle mockery of their strait-laced head of department, Deputy Assistant Commissioner Strickland. The camaraderie of the group, the funny lines and the unorthodox approach they bring to crime-solving all add up to a wonderfully original series.

Thoroughly recommended.",1339200000,,1356,5.044642857142857
3362443,5,B0014B7PQQ,"My husband and i are ""punk/skaters"" and yet we LOVE this show. Rarely is anything this funny and great made in America! It's very easy to care about these characters, you root for them, and laugh with them. A++",1335916800,,210,4.410256410256411
3362444,1,B0014B7PQQ,"After carefully reading the reviews and noting that some of them said this series was ""family friendly"" I ordered the second season because it cost the least.  Today we watched about 15 minutes of the first episode of the 2nd season and not less than 6 times there was foul language, men peeing in the men's room, very unpleasant innuendos that I suppose were suppose to be funny and a man who had a sex change.  Fifteen minutes was all we could take and thus we are out the money paid for a ""family friendly"" series.",1329004800,2,517,4.375
3362445,5,B0014B7PQQ,"I absolutely adore this show.  I have watched all the seasons.  The most recent concluded in the Fall of 2011. It is about three senior citizens policemen in the UK who are recruited to return to the force to solve cold cases.  They work under a younger woman who was demoted to this job after a dog got killed in a police raid she led.  She became a pariah to the public and had to be buried in this department.

I have really come to love the characters and none more than our nerdy one, played by Alan Armstrong, who is a font of information. He is also a super computer nerd and his long suffering wife Hester has become as great a character as he is.  Next up is Jerry, played by Dennis Waterman.  He is also hilarious as a senior copper who still draws the ladies.  He also has a retinue of ex wives who all dine with him regularly en masse. Quite good are the other two, Jack and the woman head.

The mysteries are secondary to all of this.  They do solve them and they are interesting.  However, it is their peculiar interaction with suspects, witnesses, one another and police superiors which makes this compulsively watchable.  This is more of a comedy than a crime show although they do get the job done.

3362446,5,B0014B7PQQ,I really enjoy the series and am happy to have bought this season. Our local PBS station broadcasts the series but I am not able to see all the episodes and have not seen them repeated. This is so much more convenient and I am able to see all the shows.,1322956800,,253,3.980392156862745
3362447,5,B0014B7PQQ,"In Season Two we begin to see the characters, Sandra, played by Amanda Redman, Gerry, played by Dennis Waterman, Brian, played by Alun Armstrong, and Jack, played by James Bolam, beginning to develop into the characters they'll become later on. Some of the exploration of just who the characters will be is past and the characterizations are stabilizing. It was very obvious in Season 1 that the cast would be going through a period of character refinement.

I was introduced to this series watching some of the much later shows and it has been interesting watching these seasoned actors refine their parts; they are really and truly good at what they do! We were interested to note that the theme song, ""it's Alright,"" is actually sung by Dennis Waterman who plays the part of Gerry Standing. While on the subject of versatility I must mention Alun Armstrong's peerless performance as the Innkeeper in the 10th Anniversary Production of Les Miserables, what a talent!

The depth of experience these British actors bring to their roles always amazes me; this excellent series is the direct result of their rich talent and extensive experience in British theater.

I recommend this series enthusiastically!",1322265600,6,1205,5.045226130653266
3362448,5,B0014B7PQQ,"This series was recommended by a fellow Amazon reviewer when I mentioned that I loved Inspector Morse.  We are just about finished watching Season 2 now and are looking forward to continuing with this very fun series.

I think this concept particularly appeals to our demographic.  Let's just say the younger generation might not be particularly enthralled with a bunch of late-middle-aged guys and a slightly younger and much hotter female boss, working cold cases and getting into just enough trouble to entertain themselves and the viewer but not quite enough to get the unit shut down - it's a very fine line and they dance it nimbly.

We particularly enjoy the growing chemistry among the detectives.  In the first season they emerged as a group of not particularly ingratiating sad sacks with somewhat tarnished pasts.  They were good cops with different skill sets, and they all wanted to continue to make a contribution.  In Season Two we get more of them interacting, starting to enjoy each other's company, and actually taking care of each other.  So, although we are laughing a lot, there are some genuinely touching moments.

Then there is the ambitious young Deputy Assistant Commissioner who clearly has aspirations of greater glory.  Mostly our heroes are getting into scrapes and using unorthodox measures that end up making him look bad, so he is constantly threatening to shut them down.  We know, of course, that won't happen, because there is Seasons 3, 4, 5, etc., but it's fun watching him sputter and get red in the face.

Amanda Redman does a great job of riding herd over the detectives.  She has an incident from her own past (very funny) that put the brakes on her career.  Running UCOS is pretty much her last chance.  Through most of Season One she had an air of quiet desperation, but by Season Two she cares pretty passionately about her guys and their quest and goes to great lengths to defend their out-of-the-box approach.  She tries to have a personal life, not very successfully.

Basically this is a fun, intelligent detective series with an unusual and interesting group of characters at its center.  It keeps getting better.  It's entertaining and relatively uncomplicated - just the thing for a Friday night video date with my spouse.  Highly recommended.",1320624000,,2295,4.911688311688311

3362450,1,B0014B7PQQ,"We tried to watch this series and were stopped cold by a film director who switched camera scenes about every 2 or 3 seconds.  Count how many times this happens in a single minute.  In the 1950s, I read recently, the average single camera shot lasted more than 23 seconds.  By 2007, the number was down to 2.7 seconds, apparently to rouse teenies who play computer games and expect fast viewing.  This film simply blinded us.  It's the worst example of a pernicious fashion.",1302998400,7,474,4.595238095238095

Great acting, all the actors not only can act, they have timing so that the humor is truly humorous - you don't need a laugh track to tip you off that something was said that is supposed to be funny. The writing is exceptional - I hate that so many U.S. shows (and now more and more U.K. programs corrupted by us) have simply godawful writing - hoping that talented actors can pull something out of a hat - you need both good writing and acting and if you want both, see each and every episode of New Tricks. Unreserved positive reviews for all seasons. Both my husband and I love them and never miss an episode on PBS.",1299369600,5,679,4.190839694656488
3362452,5,B0014B7PQQ,"I picked up the DVDs of Season 1 and 2 at a yard sale and thought I'd give it a shot. I was hooked in the first 10 minutes and had the thrill of finding a show that is smart, intelligent, and creative. I've now finished both series 1 and 2 and am anxiously awaiting Series 3 - to be released on 2/22/11 in the US. I think of this band of retired British police officers (led by the smart and sexy - and sometimes paranoid - female detective) as my friends. The actors are superb. And the twists and turns in the story keep it fresh.

If you are reading this review, you have probably already seen Series 1. Series 2 is just as great. A bit shorter as there is no pilot episode.

The TOP BOS has changed too. Not Sandra - but the Police Chief (or whatever his title is). I'm not as thrilled with the new guy. No personality. But he's rarely in a scene. A lot less about Sandra's personal life this time (and her hair color (black roots) seems to strangely vary from light to dark even within an episode. But this is not a complaint. The guys get funnier all the time.

Oh yes, read the credits. Three well known British actresses from the 1970s show up in three different episodes. You'd never recognize them if you hadn't read their names. Rita Tushingham is the social worker in Episode 5 and Jane Asher (Paul McCartney's girlfriend for five years) is a wealthy animal breeder in Episode 8. The real surprise for me was the one time incredibly sexy James Bond girl Honor Blackman as a celebrity TV chef in Episode 4.

If you haven't found this series before - start with Series 1. Then get this one next.

You won't be disappointed.

A brand new unit to solve cold cases, but she will be the only active police officer in the squad.  Her squad is to be retired detectives. The characters are all played beautifully.  The various cases run the gamut, and it combines beautiful humor, with the true frustrations found in police work.  The cases and the trails to discovery are well done and believable.

Not sure about this item title on Amazon - ""New Tricks: Season Two (2009)""  What does the '2009' mean?  These episodes originally aired in 2005.

The idea of putting three retired cops with different strengths under a female leader is priceless and makes for witty repartee while also keeping each man on his toes with his fellow workers. The mystery plots are well done and you don't have the 'cookie cutter' actors and actresses like you have here in the U.S.A.

In fact few brit shows last over a three series so this one is doing very well. And there's a good reason for this the characters are believable and you really get to know them as the show progresses.
And there's always alot of humour in this show , just like the great first season in fact few shows can maintain such a steady mix of humour and drama and do it this well.  The cast is also first rate with the gorgeous amanda redman leading the ucos squad each ep.  Like all brit shows this show does feature a few stories about gays and transexuals , which is fine but some homophobes probably won't like those few eps. Usually in these eps they go on about the past injustice to these groups which is a fact and that's not debated.  I watched three episodes at a time when viewing this and time just flew by!  That's how good this show is and it's great to see seniors in the lead spots doing it right and vital.  This show could easily be a hit show over here.

This, along with hilarious acting and writing, avoid boredom and bring American audiences a more sophisticated and entertaining crime dramedy. I'm American and love Law & Order and The Closer, but I really treasure New Tricks. The actors are such quality actors - you never feel an episode is drawn out or boring - they end all too quickly. I can't stop chuckling at seeing all four of them (supervisor included) on their hands and knees, searching for the curse jar to retrieve their booty, with a door opening behind Jerry and shoving him fully onto the floor with a muttered expletive. Hysterical - you never feel you're watching actors. In this series we also gain more insight into the officers' personal lives, adding another serious and sometimes funny dimension to the series.
