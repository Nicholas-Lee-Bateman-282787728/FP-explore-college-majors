8493346,4,B00659W6ZM,"Suzy is a 1936 ambitious attempt to create a comedy/romance/drama around MGMs sex goddess Jean Harlow, and it almost succeeds.
25-year old Jean Harlow (1911-1937) was the biggest sex symbol of her times. Only Marilyn Monroe in the 50s ever achieved a rival position. Harlow began by playing gangsters moll (Hells Angels, The Secret Six, Public Enemy, Scarface, Beast of the City) and moved to more complex roles in Red Dust (1932) and Three Wise Girls (1932) and then dabbled as a comedienne in Red Headed Woman (1932). By 1936 she was a fully fledged movie actress and one of MGM biggest superstars, and MGM was trying to turn her away from the sexy roles and into broader characterizations.

They succeed. She is marvelous as the chorus girl down on her luck in pre WW 1 London, who marries an Irish Engineer (Franchot Tone) and then a French Lord and Aviation Ace (Cary Grant). Along the way there is drama, war, espionage, and some aviation footage from Hells Angels, one of Harlows first films.

In 1936 Cary Grant (1904-86) was an up and coming star. He became well known for films like She Done Him Wrong (1933) and Im no Angel (1933). He plays a charming  womanizer, a role he played often and well. Though generally well regarded (AFI rates him 2nd greatest male star ever), Grant never won a major acting award and received only 2 Oscar nominations in more than 70 film outings. I liked him best in Gunga Din (1939), His Girl Friday (1940) and The Philadelphia Story (1940).

Franchot Tone (1905-68) was a marvelous actor who is best known for his Oscar nominated performance in Mutiny on the Bounty (1935). He made nearly 100 films and gave outstanding performances in films like Lives of a Bengal Lancer (1935), The Man on the Eiffel Tower (1949), and Advise & Consent (1962). He co-starred with Harlow in 4 films  Bombshell (1933), The Girl from Missouri (1934), Reckless (1935), and Suzy (1936). In this film his Irish accent is ridiculous and he is a little stiff, which is probably his idea of how an engineer would behave.

Lewis Stone (1879-1953) appears as Grants father. He was a major star in the 20s and 30s and was nominated for an Oscar for The Patriot (1930). Between 1914 and 1953 he made more than 150 films; his memorable roles were as the warden in The Big House (1930), Doctor Otternschlag in Grand Hotel (1932), and Doc in Three Godfathers (1936). Hes probably best known for his continuing role as Judge Hardy in the Andy Hardy films (1937-46).

George Fitzmaurice (1885-1940) directs. Hes best known for his work in the silent era (e.g. Son of the Sheik, 1926) and early talkies (e.g., Raffles, 1930). Fitzmaurice worked best with women.

In 1936 Jean Harlow had 3 films in the top 20  Libeled Lady ( Spencer Tracy, William Powell, and Myrna Loy), Wife vs. Secretary (Gable and Loy),  and Suzy (Cary Grant). The other big money winners were San Francisco (Gable), The Great Ziegfeld (Powell and Loy), Modern Times (Chaplin), and Charge of the Light Brigade (Flynn and de Havilland). The big Oscar winner was The Great Ziegfeld (Picture, Best Actress). Other notable films from that year were The Petrified Forest (Bogart), Romeo and Juliette (Shearer and Howard), Dodsworth (Walter Huston) and Fritz Langs Fury.

I enjoyed this film very much and think its one of Harlows best.",1470700800,,3310,4.7491289198606275

8493348,4,B00659W6ZM,"American chorus girl meets Irish inventor working in London mistaking him for a lord.  He's such a decent sort that she agrees to marry him.  He eavesdrops on his employer, who happens to run a German spy ring just before WW1 starts.  They follow him home and shoot him down in front of Suzy.  She panics and flees to Paris to her girlfriend working a cabaret job.  WW1 breaks out, and she meets a famous French flier, falls in love for real and marries again.

Her new husband turns out to be a womanizer, that her father-in-law tries to turn around.  After being wounded, he takes up with another woman that turns out to be the same spy that shot her first husband.  Worse, her first husband turns up in the RAF as a technical advisor on new aircraft.  This all leads to a tragic conclusion.

This actually turns out to be an interesting mix of love triangle and spy story. It really isn't an aviation movie, though that end of it is given good production value treatment.  The hero's plane is an SE5, seen briefly earlier and in a dogfight with Fokker DVII's in the last five minutes.  There's some Thomas Morse Scouts doubling as Nieuports on the airfield.",1397260800,2,1160,4.4714285714285715

8493351,5,B00659W6ZM,"Despite the fact that the motion picture code was in effect which severely hampered Hollywood's ability to get away with a lot of snappy double entendre dialogue, racy situations, and even racier adult plots, this movie speaks volumes re: how Hollywood dealt with the restrictions of the production code and still managed to keep things interesting.
Jean Harlow is the snappy  title character who meets her dream man (Franchot Tone) only to seemingly lose him right after they marry. To escape potential prosecution for murder, Suzy escapes to France only to discover love again with a dashing flyboy portrayed by Cary Grant with a lot of charm. In fact, Grant's character Andre is so charming that he borders on greasy. This guy really lays the suave on thick. Naive Suzy's world goes crazy as 1st husband presumed dead  flyboy Terry (Tone) surfaces as 2nd husband Andre turns out to be a real love rat playboy who proves that too much charm does not translate to good husband material. Between a little misty eyed disillusionment and typical Harlowesque courage this story plays out with drama, humor, and a much deserved happy ending.
The supporting cast is terrific featuring Lewis Stone, Benita Hume, Inez Courtney, and the irascible Una O'Connor, but this is really Harlow's show and she pulls no stops here. She is sweet, sexy, vulnerable, and totally decent in this one but still a little off center from the normal Hollywood heroine.
This movie is a lot of fun and again proves that Harlow had a bright future in films.",1346112000,10,1528,4.873076923076923
