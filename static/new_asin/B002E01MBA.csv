3915064,4,B002E01MBA,Interesting film of about a medieval samurai based on Shakespeare's Macbeth.  A ghost prophesies that a castle ruler will become the ruler of all surrounding forest castles.  The prophecy comes true but with unintended consequences for himself and his family.  There is even a Lady Macbeth moment.,1301788800,3,297,5.276595744680851
3915065,5,B002E01MBA,"An Awesome Movie! I have just seen it for the first time, and I enjoyed it well. A bit slow in some areas of the film, but it does not ruin the movie at all. Throne Of Blood (1957) is worth watching for a good samurai movie!",1478995200,2,224,3.7872340425531914
3915066,5,B002E01MBA,"Mr Kurosawa's version of Macbeth is really good, and easier to follow, more compact, than the originals story. Substituting the three witches for a ghostly apparition helps to speed up the action.

3915075,5,B002E01MBA,"I have long been a fan of Shakespeare, and loved Kurosawa's work from the time I first saw Seven Samurai and Rashomon years ago.  Not sure how it took me this long to see this, but Throne of Blood is amazing.  The drama is stirring and the tension and suspense is palpable throughout.  The ""Lady Macbeth"" role is creepy in the very best way - absolutely brilliant performance.  Mifune was as good as in anything.  This easily rivals Seven Samurai as my favorite Kurosawa film.",1454198400,11,476,4.552941176470588

3915079,5,B002E01MBA,"Why does it seem that all Japanese Samurai always yelled at each other?  Throne of Blood or the Spider Web Castle is Akira Kurosawa version of Shakespeare's  Macbeth.  Toshir Mifune is Taketoki Washizu a Samurai General who after winning a battle is riding to his Lord's castle when he meets a woodland Spirit who foretells his future.  What follows is betrayal, murder and battle.  Shakespeare is good in any language.  As directed by Kurosawa it becomes a spectacular story.  Instead of men in kilts we have silk clad Lords and ladies, some who plot betrayal and murder and of course large numbers of Samurai soldiers.  The film is well place and Mifune is a great actor.  The supporting cast does a great job of moving the story along.  Kurosawa's use of storms and wind add to the story and help make this dark tale more intense.  This is a good film.",1445126400,5,855,4.596026490066225

3915084,5,B002E01MBA,"Throne Of Blood is a dark and surreal film by Akira Kurosawa based on Shakespeare's Macbeth.  The imagery and landscapes bear thick fogs and stark shadows.  The protagonist meets a ghost in the forest whom prophesies his ascent to power.  When things come true for him, his wife warns him of the betrayal that will ensue.  But is she right?  What actions will he take and what are the consequences?

3915086,2,B002E01MBA,"A case study of a filmmakers botched attempt to high jack the acclaim of his source materials.  The script is co-written by the director.  It is confusing and lacks polish (script traits usually exhibited when this director is one of two authors or the sole author). Acting by the lead male actor is mostly confined to grimaces (he looks like he needs a root canal operation due to all the scenery he has chewed on).  The lead female actress employs an acting style consisting of mostly monotonic line readings and a mask-like, unchanging facial expression.  The real co-stars are the costumes which are spectacular (too bad the film was not shot in color), and in-camera special effects (especially the arrow showers at the films end).  Sets are OK, but exterior long shots of castles show structures that are far removed from restored/rebuilt castles of the period on view in Japan today. (Perhaps impoverished exterior sets are a result of budgetary constraints?)  Subtitles are a bit long and often abrupt.  Film score is fine.  Restoration = five stars.  A highly unrecommended film experience.  WILLIAM FLANIGAN, PhD.",1402790400,,1123,5.021621621621621

3915088,5,B002E01MBA,"Once Shakespeare is rendered cinematically in Japanese, all the great poetry is lost. But what a cinefile's delight ! Same judgement applies for Ran, Kurosawa's version of King Lear. IMHO, it bests all movie versions of the play, including Peter Brooke's. If you are familiar with the plot, you could almost watch this without subtitles. There are nuances and subtleties in the original verse that will continue to delight all lovers of English in a good interpretation- but images like these will remain unique. I think it has closer ties to traditional Japanese theater than Ran. All admirers of Kurosawa must have noticed his obsession with forrests- well, they won't be disappointed here, either for the witches' hut or in the moving version :)",1391299200,13,748,5.040322580645161

3915091,5,B002E01MBA,"If there's one thing that stands out about this film, it's its sheer intensity. Mifune Toshiro practically chews the scenery in the lead. The incidental music is unbelievably, almost electrifyingly dramatic. The low howl of the wind alone sounds like something straight out of Eraserhead.

The cinematography is so stark and laid bare as to practically scream at the audience from beginning to end. We're all used to seeing black and white photography used to express the stylish and refined, as in the mode of a Humphrey Bogart or Bette Davis melodrama. But what Kurosawa crafts here, particularly in the wilderness scenes, is so utterly primeval that I can only compare its vision to the original King Kong. It's incredible what the brush of a true master can paint with only black and white.

As you might expect, my only reservations about this movie are as to whether it's almost _too_ intense. Is it a masterpiece, or is it just over the top?

Perhaps the very fact that we find ourselves asking such questions says more about the way we are used to seeing - and thinking about - Shakespeare than anything else. Throne of Blood is the ultimate antidote to ""reverential"" productions of the bard. It's a stark, brutal, no-holds-barred take on betrayal, murder, and ultimately madness. Paradoxically, I find myself wondering if for all its oriental trappings, it might not be the closest any of us will get to seeing how the Elizabethans themselves would've performed Shakespeare.

One final thought: clearly set in Japan's ""Sengoku"" or ""Warring States"" period, perhaps the most dystopian element of the film is the sense it gives that it is offering us just one small window into this bleak and horrifying age. In this, Kurosawa is clearly making a break with Shakespeare's original vision of Macbeth, which in the end resolves itself into an orderly, governed universe.

Throne of Blood offers no such solace. Rather, we are left in the end with the feeling that at any time the camera could have pulled back and shown us a whole world of murder and betrayal. An entire age of empty slaughter and pointless death, driven on by nothing more than blind, lurching panic and grasping greed.

Or, in the words of Macbeth himself:

And pity, like a naked new-born babe,
Striding the blast, or heaven's cherubim, horsed
Upon the sightless couriers of the air,
Shall blow the horrid deed in every eye,
That tears shall drown the wind. I have no spur
To prick the sides of my intent, but only
Vaulting ambition, which o'erleaps itself
And falls on the other.

3915092,5,B002E01MBA,Certainly one of the best renditions of the Macbeth story and a very well-done movie by the incomparable Kurosawa. The black-and-white scenes capture the dark mood and atmosphere so well. This is one movie classic you don't want to miss!,1354838400,2,237,4.95
3915093,1,B002E01MBA,The Essential Art House version of Throne of Blood is a poor quality DVD of a poor quality film print.  There were 3 or 4 places where the screen dissolved into the same square pixels I see when my satellite TV goes wonky.  The cover of my copy didn't resemble the Essential Art House cover show on the Amazon page.  But the acting and cinematography made it worth the 12 USD I paid for it.

8366628,3,B002E01MBA,"Kurosawa was a great filmmaker, a cinematic genius.  As with most artists, there are some marvelous works and less interesting ones.  The story line and cinematography in Throne of Blood are good examples of how Kurosawa transferred literary works to the screen.  My problem with this movie is Mifune's character.  He's practically manic in nearly every scene, looking terribly confused, like he's about to explode.  For me, there wasn't enough interaction between the main characters, with the exception, perhaps of his wife.  The main focus in on Mifune's anxiety about what may or may not happen.  His performance seemed overwrought, as if he were trying too hard to show the character's personality.  The ending scenes with him trying to flee from arrows coming from all directions seemed over the top.  I much prefer his acting in Yojimbo & Sanjuro, High and Low, and others where he's not ""on"" all throughout the movie.",1500249600,2,925,5.032894736842105
8366629,5,B002E01MBA,"I couldn't possibly pick a single favorite Kurosawa film, but Throne of Blood is definitely in the top two or three.
First, regarding the movie itself, the acting, costumes, action sequences and cinematography are all top notch. It contains stunning visuals, such as the pervasive fog-enshrouded landscape, the spirit in the woods and the final sequence with the moving forest. Furthermore, Kurosawa is still unmatched when it comes to filming a large army on the move, as is seen more than once in Throne of Blood (and later in Ran).
Toshiro Mifune gives a visceral and energetic performance as Washizu (essentially Macbeth), but perhaps the most memorable role is played by Isuzu Yamada as Asaji (Lady Macbeth), who, in spite of her limited screen time, is chilling and unforgettable due her ruthlessness, emotional detachment, and pessimistic view of human nature.
Like the best Kurosawa films, it's also thematically interesting, especially with its exploration of the paranoia that comes from power, leading to a circle of violence springing from the idea of killing your potential rival before they decide to kill you.
The Criterion Blu-Ray is also great. The picture is clear, and the sound is as good as can be expected for being monaural. I also found the extras very interesting, especially the essay relating to the difficulties of subtitling Japanese films. The film also includes two separate English subtitle options to reveal the subjectivity of this process. As an occasional translator of Spanish and Portuguese texts I found this fascinating.
Throne of Blood is definitely worth having in your collection if you're a fan of Shakespeare adaptations, Kurosawa, or good drama films in general.",1495411200,4,1708,5.214545454545455
8366630,5,B002E01MBA,"It is with Ran by the same director a take on a Shakespeare play, in this case, MacBeth.  Ran is Lear.  They are both moving in their  way, especially Ran and the costumes, the acting, the settings take you to another place, another time but the stories they tell are universal.  You may notice that I prefer Ran, but that is because I remember certain moving scenes--Lear riding happily with the  son he banished right before that son is shot down--it is heart breaking as the death of Cordelia  in the original Shakespeare. You cannot forget it.  Toshiro Mifune is great in any role, by the way.",1494633600,,597,4.5233644859813085
