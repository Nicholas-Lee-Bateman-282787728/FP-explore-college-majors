These Nazi-sexploitation three-pack is all about the Nazis; which means that, they are the protagonists, antagonists, and everything in-between in these movies.  Once more, there is nudity, sex, more female nudity (and believe me the women are all young-Italian and hot). My ranking of the three would be: 1) ""Gestapo's Last Orgy"" (the blond actress is amazingly hot) and so is the Nazi-soldier woman, the movie also has very good plot, and great music score; 2) ""SS Hell Camp"" (Lots of female nudity and good story-line with music); 3) Red Nights of Gestapo""-- Good acting and historically speaking interesting plot, not enough nudity.",1391212800,6,754,5.130081300813008

8386186,4,B0030U1T48,"It's hard to write a serious review for this kind of thing.  I bought this somewhat out of curiosity and I guess for the thrill of owning something that ""mom wouldn't approve of..."" and they don't disappoint.  I wasn't expecting anything earth-shattering and these movies certainly aren't.  If you know what you're buying then go ahead and buy this pack, if you're expecting a piece of cinematic genius then maybe you're in the wrong place.  Is it wrong that I found myself laughing a great deal while I watched these?  Never mind.",1330992000,3,531,4.728260869565218

So to save you a little time here is the IDMB synopsis of the movies...

SS Hell Camp 2 (1977) aka SS Hell Pack 2
This is one of many so called Video Nasties about fictionalized World War 2 Nazi POW camp atrocities. A beautiful, nefarious senior female SS officer/doctor (Magall) creates a genetic, mutant human Beast (half man/half beast). The Beast is a rapacious, squat, mongoloid sex fiend which she uses to torture and molest female prisoners while the Nazis watch. The vertically challenged beast is kept on a diet of mega-aphrodisiacs. There is plenty of sadistic titillation's, gore and nudity in this Nazi sub-genre exploitation flick. By the way there is no Part 1. IMDB Score 2.9

The Red Nights of the Gestapo (1977)
An illustrious group of German industrialists plot to overthrow Hitler by negotiating a peace treaty with England. Disgraced, but dedicated Nazi officer Colonel Werner von Uhland is assigned by his superiors to ferret out these deceitful dissidents and stop them before it's too late. von Uhland recruits a bunch of beautiful women to seduce these traitors and undermine their conspiracy. IMDB Score 4.8

The Gestapo's Last Orgy (1977)
Lise Cohen is taken to a special prisoner-of-war camp for female Jews, a camp run as a bordello to entertain the German officers and troops going in to battle. The camp is run with an iron fist by Commandant Starker and his minion Alma. Starker becomes frustrated when Lise demonstrates no fear, and devises cruel experiments to scare her, to no avail. Once she realizes her guilt is unfounded, Lise begins to play Starker's game, but even though she begins living a better life, she doesn't forget the atrocities she has seen and experienced. IMDB Score 4.7

Are these great movies worthy of Oscars? NO! Are they complete crap? NO! They are your typical Nazi exploitation films that were so popular in Europe in the 1970's -&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Salon-Kitty/dp/B000096IBX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Salon Kitty</a>&nbsp;these are not, but they aren't bad either - just know what you are getting. Cheesy exploit films that often try to shock and fail with ample skin exposed. Simple enough?",1286496000,23,2366,5.183246073298429
