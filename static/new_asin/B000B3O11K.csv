The Christy series is a wholesome series that teaches timeless good principles that the world needs today.",1395273600,,141,4.68
2399542,5,B000B3O11K,"This is a very well done movie, however it is best to watch the Christy series and ""Return to Cutter Gap"" prior to watching this because it will be easier to understand the characters.  The Christy shows teach us a lot about human perseverence in times of trials and how to love and understand others who are different from us.",1294704000,4,327,4.45
2399543,5,B000B3O11K,I watched the movie and enjoyed it.  It was a good movie.  It was sad when her friend died and she struggled with her faith.  It was good when she refound her faith.,1281052800,,165,3.9393939393939394
2399544,1,B000B3O11K,"Don't get me wrong...the movie isn't bad.  The problem is that this movie is actually Christy: A Change of Seasons, edited and marketed by another company.  There is nothing in the description to indicate this and I ended up purchasing the movie without need to, since I already had it.",1253491200,45,286,4.7
8081350,4,B000B3O11K,"It has a good message but I was hoping for the original actress who played Christy to be in it.  The quality of the movie was not wonderful, though. Quick service.",1520035200,,163,4.258064516129032

8081352,5,B000B3O11K,"Good movie. The show is, obviously, way better, but the movie helps give closure.",1464307200,,81,4.857142857142857
8081353,3,B000B3O11K,This was a duplicate of another of the Christy movies.  I feel like I was cheated because I thought it was a new storyline!,1461283200,,123,4.125
8081354,3,B000B3O11K,"It was good, it is dissapointing that all most of the characters including Christy are not the same as those in the Christy series. I did still enjoy it though.",1438905600,,160,4.366666666666666
8081355,3,B000B3O11K,"I hate that nearly all the original cast is not in the movies. The show was good, movies are a bit too preachy for me and I'm a minister.",1433289600,,137,3.7586206896551726

8081358,5,B000B3O11K,WONDERFUL FAMILY  MINI SERIES. GREAT FOR CHILDREN. HAS A LOT OF REALLY GREAT FAMILY  EXPERIENCES THAT THEY CAN LEARN FROM  AND IS VERY ENTERTAINING  BECAUSE OF THE CHILDREN THAT ARE IN IT AND BECAUSE THEY ARE THE ONES WE LEARN LIFE LESSONS FROM A LOT OF THE TIME.  CHRISTY ALSO GROWS  FROM A GIRL TO A YOUNG WOMAN AND LEARNS A LOT ABOUT LIFE AND PEOPLE FROM THE PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN THE MOUNTAINS/HILLS.  ANYONE WHO WATCHES THE MINI-SERIES  WILL COME AWAY I AM SURE WITH A SMILE ON THEIR FACE AND M O ST LIKELY ALSO HAVE SHED A FEW  TEARS.  SUSIE NEICE,1420675200,,550,4.201923076923077
