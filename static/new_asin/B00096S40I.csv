Actually, it's a 3-Star movie for its camp value alone; but ""Adolf Hitler: His Life"" goes beyond camp. The footage from which the biography is drawn is 60-70 years old, so of course it's shoddy, but it is also authentic. There a too-brief scene of 'the Fuhrer' doing a Cha-cha, and the scenes of his lover and soul mate Eva Braun are classic--once unintentionally lascivious as she exercises on her back...

Historically, if the viewer gives the film a chance, and pays attention to it,  there are valuable insights as well, as when the Third Reich Youth Movements are exposed for what they actually designed for--training grounds for German children blossoming into full-fledged members of the military that carried out World War II. This isn't a particularly strong movie--but surely it shouldn't be written off as a 1, or even 2 Star film as has been so common on Netflix.",1390435200,,1026,4.890804597701149

It's just a shame that the quality of the image was sometimes mediocre at best! The narration works well and the documentary takes enough time to tell the viewer a lot about Hitler; his personal life mostly before his rise to power which culminated in Hitler having complete control over Germany once Hindenburg died; how Hitler used his speeches and the Nazi propaganda machine to fool the German public into thinking that the Nazi party, the only political party allowed in Germany under Hitler's dictatorship, could actually solve all their problems--and of course, how it was absolutely essential for Nazis to killed ""inferior races"" like Jews, intellectually challenged people and anyone else who would oppose him including church officials.

The documentary is actually separated into two parts. The first part is mostly about Hitler's early life, his failure as an artist and his time in prison after an early attempt to seize power in the 1920s; and the second, longer chapter covering Hitler's rise to power in 1933 and how he ignored the treaty of Versailles to rebuild a massive German military which at first took comparatively small steps to gain land. This second segment also shows how Hitler ultimately invaded Poland thus bringing about the beginning of World War Two. It was interesting to see some footage that I have never seen before; the other reviewer writes that this is old footage but I myself have never seen some of it and I've certainly watched my share of documentaries about World War Two!

In addition, there is informative narration with more footage about Hitler's increasing time spent at his retreat where his mistress Eva Braun lived; we learn that Hitler spent more time there as the war became more and more intense. The filmmakers also explore the downfall of The Third Reich.

Of course, there's much more detail than what I've mentioned here; I will leave that out so that others can learn from this documentary. Look in particular for brief interviews with people who were close to Hitler; there is some commentary by his sister and his valet, for example.

There are no DVD extras but overall the film is quite informative so this becomes a minor quibble. My only true complaint is that the footage, albeit quite interesting to watch, is sometimes poor in terms of quality. Images are often fuzzy and that's a disappointment.

Overall, Adolf Hitler: His Life is informative but perhaps the film is best geared toward people just beginning to study Hitler and The Third Reich in Nazi Germany. This film is also good for people who have a basic understanding of Germany during World War Two but who want to increase their knowledge.",1348012800,2,2793,4.896405919661734
8057679,1,B00096S40I,"Unless you like very, very old documentaries on Hitler, I would steer far away from this DVD. Even at the price, the sound is terrible, and the footage is archaic. Look elsewhere for better quality at around the same price.",1121644800,4,223,4.6
