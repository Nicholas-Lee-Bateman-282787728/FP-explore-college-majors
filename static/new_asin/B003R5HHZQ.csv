4178151,3,B003R5HHZQ,"I just wanted to add this in for the interest of others.  My name is Alex Calabrese, if you read the book you know the mobster Paddy Calabrese.  This man was my grandfather. He was very interesting, not the nicest bloak but he did some good things in his life also.  I felt compelled to write at least something as both of my grandparents recently passed away. My grandmother, the wife of james caan's character passed away from sudden cancer it was heartbreaking and even her former husband Paddy came down for her funeral.  And Thomas Leonhard sent flowers that I saw at the open-casket ceremony.  When I saw them with his name I got the chills.  I live close to my uncle Mike who was estranged from his father and he's the nicest man you could meet. My grandfather Paddy passed away this past spring of a heart attack and my Dad was hurt.  My grandma was a great person and she loved all of her grandchildren and took us places together.  So when she died people from California to New York came to her funeral.  I just saw what the previous writer wrote about my Grandma's character, and I was hurt. But that's no insult to him because the book and/or movie was his only insight.  But my family wasn't exactly pleased by some of the portrayals.  If anyone would like to ask a question about the stroy or book/movie feel free to post it.",1150588800,4,1340,4.384615384615385
4178152,5,B003R5HHZQ,This is a very overlooked movie--James Caan is at his finest and he shows true emotion thru out it.  Check it out when he finally finds his kids and his reaction--only a true actor could be this good.  This should be on DVD--hope it will be in the future.  Check out other James Caan flicks in the meantime like The Gambler and the Godfather!!! Classics!!!!!!,1106524800,3,359,4.492307692307692
4178153,5,B003R5HHZQ,"James Caan is an actor I associate with rolls in which his character dishes out a notable amount of willful and nasty violence.  For example,  ""The Godfather"", ""The Killer Elite"",  ""Flesh and Bone"" and ""Eraser.""  Even  some of his less violent rolls, like ""Garden of Stone"" still depend on his  tough persona.  ""Hide in Plain Sight"" has Caan playing a remarkably subdued  and complex character. In fact, the violence in this movie, if you can call  it that, is mostly emotional tension.
In the movie, Caan plays a  divorced father, whose rather dumb former wife and her slimly new husband  disappear into a government witness relocation program along with Caan's  two young children.  Caan, whose movie job is an anonymous laborer in a  tire factory, is revealed to be a former Vietnam era marine. But in this  movie, the emphasis is on Caan the plain working man, deeply caring father,  and, up to a point, a person willing to wait for the government to do the  right thing, which is to return his own kids to his safekeeping.
In his  roll, Caan is fully believable as someone who could have made a stupid  decision about who to marry eight or nine years ago.  He is a strong man  who keeps everything under control not because he is anyway repressed, but  because he is what he appears to be, a basically nice guy.  (By the way,  the movie was also directed by Caan.)
The movie is neatly divided into  three parts.  The first introduces Caan, some of his friends from the  factory. his former wife and her low-level mobster boyfriend, and the  boyfriend's high level, and obviously very dangerous, mobster friends. It  highlights Caan's close relationship with his kids, and his new love  interest, played by Jill Eikenberry.  It also sets up a reason for the mob  and the boyfriend's interests to move in different directions.  Dividing  interests which lead the boyfriend to testify against his former associates  and then move immediately on into the witness relocation program, sweeping  Caan's former wife and kids along with him.
The second third of the movie  shows Caan's repeatedly frustrated attempts to find his kids.  At the most  basic level the interest of the government is to deny evolvement, deny Caan  any parental rights (the mother had custody of the kids), and if that  doesn't work, avoid talking to him.  There are some nice scenes here  establishing the character and commitment of Caan's new girl friend. There  are also good scenes showing the mixed feelings of some of the law  enforcement types torn between their battle with the mob, and their  sympathy for Caan's predicament, and the well played roll of a sympathetic  lawyer who tries to help Caan by working the legal angles. (There's also  one hilarious ""violent"" scene here in which nobody gets hurt, but left me  rolling on the floor.)
The third and shortest part of the movie is a  race; a race between Caan, the mob and the government.  Caan is racing to  recover his kids after he has located them, the mob is trying to kill the  missing witness as an act of revenge that could well end up hurting the  kids, and government are trying to arrive in time to set things more or  less right.
I loved it.  How come no one else has noticed how good this  movie is?",964310400,10,3249,4.671403197158082
8403273,4,B003R5HHZQ,"James Caan's lone cinematic directorial effort, this film has a particular vibe that sets it apart without drawing attention to artistic impositions.  Caan simmers with anger at the government even as he tenderly embraces the prospect of fatherhood once more.  His character drives the film, and late action derives its meaning for the audience from Caan consistently displayed parental devotion.  A winning story receives good pacing, eye-catching editing, and solid performances all around.",1490659200,,492,5.712328767123288

Tried finding this on Netflix and they didn't have it. Coming from the area where the story takes place, it held a lot of interest for me. I did enjoy the film.",1464566400,,291,3.9491525423728815

8403277,1,B003R5HHZQ,There are just some stories that are simply too boring to be made into a movie and this is one of the those stories!,1413331200,,116,3.875
8403278,2,B003R5HHZQ,"Hide in Plain Sight (1980) is a movie that has a 1970's feel
to it, insofar as it demonstrates mature relationships between
women and men, and takes a sober, realistic view of the highs and
lows of working men and women. e.g.  parenthood, hobbies like
going fishing, baseball games - showing a time when people had
time to breathe, think and enjoy simple activities, as opposed to
the increasingly frantic pace of modern life in North America.

Set in the inner city, the most obvious visual changes touch upon
the  vehicles driven and new technology (telephones, etc.) in this
day and age.

Here, James Caan plays a hard-working family man that is divorced
from the mother of his 2 childen, who leaves to marry a hot-head
who is associated with underground gang activities.

Danny Aiello takes on the case, as a courageous, idealistic
attorney, who believes in family values, and in placing limits on
an out-of-control big government, that tends to answer to nobody,
except perhaps the mass media and public opinion. This is the case
mainly from fears on the potential impact at the ballot box for
Congress, the Senate and the Whitehouse.

The editing, music, the calm paced nature of the movie is positive,
counter-balancing the more sinister aspects of the story, such
as a hold-up in a bank, a witness protection program that is clumsily
run, conflict in the workplace from Machevellian characters, government
workers showing in rare cases sloth, etc.

The morale of the story is to not underestimate the natural ties
between parents and their children, to those who insert themselves
between the two.",1361664000,,1605,4.944237918215613
8403279,5,B003R5HHZQ,"Movie was just as good as I seen it years ago, Acting was fair, city hasn't changed much. I was in City Hall when the robbery took place,I worked at Brinks at thr time and we were to bring the extra money so the city employees could cash their pay check, it was because X mass was one week away. The guy who robbed the hall jumped the WRONG counter and took the water bills receipts. The mob didn't belive him, so there the Gov. hid him and his girl friend, aith her 2 kids. There more, but it would take up to much time.",1333584000,,521,3.9714285714285715
8403280,4,B003R5HHZQ,"A vastly underated film telling the true story of a father who comes home to find his family vanished under the witness protection program. This was sadly James Caan,s one and only attempt at Directing-a shame as he made a verey verey good job of it.",1293494400,3,250,4.456521739130435
8403281,4,B003R5HHZQ,"What an underappreciated treasure James Caan is!  With little fanfare he's accumulated a solid body of work and this film, the only one where he held the director's reins, is no exception.  He delivers a solid film without resorting to any fluorishes that would draw attention away from the story.  For instance it's set in 1967 but Caan does not resort to cliched period details like annoying soundtrack music to advertise the time and place.  It's his performance as Thomas Macklin, a hard working blue-collar divorced dad whose children are whisked away from him by some overzealous feds, that's front and center here.  Caan forcefully projects the anger and heartbreak of a guy who follows the rules who feels betrayed by the government he fought to protect.  It's unfortunate, however, that this is not a perfect film.  I found the mob types and Witness Protection folk presented here to be a mite on the cliched side.  The story ends a little too pat and abruptly to suit my taste.  That said, four-fifths of an orange is better than none at all and ""Hide In Plain Sight"" is near the top of the class.",1291507200,,1107,4.694300518134715
