This takes place in Asia (?) in 1955. American soldiers walk in a marketplace and take pictures. They see a snake charmer. The Lamians believe men and woman can turn into snakes. They are told where this happens for $100 (a huge sum then). Daru takes $10 as a down payment. The soldiers wear robes and are warned to keep silent on pain of death. Then the show begins! The flash of a camera starts a small riot. The soldiers flee in their jeep, then return for Nick. One man cuts the snakebite to release the venom. The wounded corporal is into a hospital, the window is open! Something happens at night! Only a snake with a brain could do it. The others return to New York city. One soldier hears bad news. Late at night a woman screams! She saw a man! She has just arrived in New York. Tom befriends Lisa.

They see the sights together. A small dog barks at Lisa. [Did you catch the clues?] Rico runs a neighborhood bowling alley. What is in his back seat? A woman walks away. There is a funeral. A horse shies away from Lisa. [Horse drawn wagons in New York city? Note that old style refrigerator.] Lisa left her gloves behind, he returns them to her apartment. Where is she? Later one of that group jumped out of a window! The next day two of that group are called to the police station; Carl is dead. Julia cooks with a pressure cooker. [Remember them?] The police question the pair. One tells about their experience in Asia and the threat. Can anything happen to Paul? He kisses Lisa. Later the police find a body. Pete was found dead from snakebite. At the theater Julia is threatened by a snake. But it is pushed out the window, lands on the pavement, and is killed. Then it undergoes a metamorphosis!

This is a low-budget production that just runs along. One value is its views of New York city life in that era. [Even if filmed on a back lot.] Much has changed since then (but Im not a witness). How did Immigration allow a cobra to enter the country? I thought they were banned like vampires and werewolves.",1435536000,,2048,4.356020942408377
