6123850,5,B00GXW0CUM,"Once again, Jefferson Moore delivers a stellar performance as Jesus Christ in the Perfect Stranger 3. If you can though, you really should purchase the Set of 3 Movies entitled: The Perfect Stranger, Another Perfect Stranger, and The Perfect Gift , and watch them prior to watching this one. It will make a lot more sense to you, if you do.  If you love good Christian movies that will touch your heart and leave you feeling blessed and loved......by our LORD, then you NEED to buy these movies.",1391299200,8,495,4.625
6123851,5,B00GXW0CUM,"I love this film.  Having seen the other movies in this series, I knew that it would be good; it far surpassed my expectations.  It is one of the most beautiful movies that I've ever seen, and I know that anyone who watches it will feel the same.  Every film that I've watched from Kelly's Filmworks is outstanding.  I recommend that people who enjoy wholesome family entertainment get this movie, and the other two in the series.  The music is incredible, too; particularly the song ""Amazing"" at the end of the movie.  It is very appropriately titled.  I'm sure that I will watch this film over and over, and I hope that anyone who reads this review loves ""Nikki and the Perfect Stranger"" as much as I do.  I also encourage the people who love this film to get the others that are produced by this incredible production company!",1389744000,7,829,4.516778523489933
6123852,4,B00GXW0CUM,"This was the third and final in a series of books by David Gregory, and the screenplay by Mr. Moore.  I loved the first movie, it was moving, emotional with a beautiful ending!  The second was good, I enjoyed it.  We were waiting with bated breath for this final in the series.  i don't kinow how the book is, but the movie was a little disappointing.  I didn't find the actress they choose to be as convincing as the first Nikki.  However, the meaning of Christ's mission, and questions that loom for the average Christian were all spot on and that was gripping as usual. We enjoyed seeing the Pastor from the Perfect gift, and getting the update about his life...that was an unexpected pleasure!

 I love Mr. Moore's portrayl of Christ, he is phenomenal, regardless of the script, and so for that alone, I'd say it's worth a look-see.  Along with the Biblical teachings of Christ, which is never boring but exciting and peaceful at once.  I hope Mr. Moore does another film portraying Christ, perhaps another visit to the town from ""PERFECT GIFT"" which was our all time favorite!  God bless~",1389139200,19,1093,4.61139896373057
6123853,5,B00GXW0CUM,"This series is perfect, and any Christian home or anyone interested in Christianity would do very well to purchase the entire series.  I am anxiously awaiting P.S. 3 and know I will enjoy it.",1388707200,,191,4.617647058823529
6123854,5,B00GXW0CUM,"This is the final installment of the David Gregory books of the Perfect Stranger. It is an excellent adaptation. The only major difference was very personal to me, but it works anyway. If you're a looking for answers to your spiritual life, this will complete the journey. There will always be questions, but there are always answers as well. This helps you understand not only the questions, but that you are not along and that there is an answer.",1386460800,12,448,4.6835443037974684
6123855,5,B00GXW0CUM,"This movie is outstanding!  If you have seen the first two Perfect Stranger movies, you will love this.  I wasn't sure how I would feel about a ""new"" Nikki, but Juliana Allen was made for this role.  Jefferson Moore was brilliant as always.  I found the movie to be warm and realistic, with a touch of well-placed humor.  Please see this movie....you will not be disappointed.",1386115200,16,376,4.636363636363637

6123860,4,B00GXW0CUM,Very nice story however I would have liked it better if they had the original Nikki (Pamela Brumley) cast in the role.  I believe she had a bit better personality for this particular role.,1440806400,,188,4.529411764705882
6123861,3,B00GXW0CUM,"The message is great but the story line could be a lot better.
The first movie of this series, ""Dinner With a Perfect Stranger"" is actually one of my favorite movies!",1439856000,,166,4.387096774193548
6123862,5,B00GXW0CUM,"THIS MOVIE IS AN EYE OPENER ABOUT HOW WE FORGET ABOUT GOD, AND CHRISTIANS SOMETIMES THINK WE ARE TOO GOOD TO SHARE THE GOOD NEWS OF GOD BEING WITH US TO HELP US BE COME MORE LIKE HIM ALL THE TIME. TAKE TIME TO BE JESUS VOICE AND HANDS IN OTHER PEOPLE'S LIVES. MY 7 HOME SCHOOLED CHILDREN WERE CHALLENGED BY THIS MOVIE AND WE HAD A GOOD CONVERSATION ABOUT IT.",1434153600,,358,4.056338028169014

6123865,5,B00GXW0CUM,"All of Jefferson Moore's movies are great. They reach you in a way that is very special.
God and religion is given to you in away where you feel and understand,not where it is forced on you.
I saw The Perfect Stranger and after that I feel a total change in my life.
The actors are great,and everyone seems to relate to each other. You are drawn into the story as if you
were there and a part of it.
If you haven't seen his movies,do so! You will not be sorry. I bought every one of his movies.
I pray he continues to make more.",1425081600,,528,3.990566037735849

6123867,2,B00GXW0CUM,"Very short sequel to the ""Perfect Stranger"" series. A little over an hour. Why it was even made is beyond me. Adds nothing to the David Gregory trilogy. Too bad, paid premium price for an hours worth of entertainment. There were some great moments in the movie, especially Jesus revealing the righteous glow of the lady in the car window. That was the hilite for me. Not worth the price.",1424390400,,387,4.542857142857143

6123870,5,B00GXW0CUM,"Best portrayal of how Jesus Christ would talk to a person struggling to understand God and Heaven.  Gratefully, it shows religion for what it is; man's attempt at working their way to Heaven, versus the free gift of Grace that Christ died for to restore every human's relation with God by removing our sins.",1417392000,2,307,4.685185185185185
6123871,5,B00GXW0CUM,"Glad I have the chance to rate this movie! It was AWESOME!!  I've enjoyed ALL the Stranger Movies! My hats off to Jefferson Moore, who played ""Jesus"" in all the movies! This last movie, was especially enlightening! Ya gotta pay attention to the words that are spoken by the characters! They can really minister to you, if you ""Listen""! Ask God to ""open your ears"" to hear His voice through the Characters! God Bless Everyone!!  Ed Dennis (Mr Ed)",1416009600,2,445,4.620253164556962
6123872,5,B00GXW0CUM,Very good trilogy. This movie was a little different in that it built on to the messages in the previous movies. Jefferson Moore is a genius.,1410912000,,141,4.461538461538462
6123873,5,B00GXW0CUM,"Fourth movie in the series. I liked it as much as the other ones, but it left you wondering what happens at the end.",1410480000,,116,3.875
6123874,5,B00GXW0CUM,goes well with the books,1409961600,,24,4.0
6123875,4,B00GXW0CUM,"I watched this before reading the book.  I think it would have been richer in the other direction, so now that I've read the book (for the first of many times), I am looking forward to watching it again.",1409270400,,203,4.205128205128205
6123876,5,B00GXW0CUM,Very good movie,1408579200,,15,4.333333333333333
6123877,1,B00GXW0CUM,"I was really disappointed.  It doesn't measure up to the other two.  If the original actress (Pamela Brumly?) who played Nikki was not available, the movie shouldn't have been done.  The whole plot was weak anyway.  Nikki's sour attitude really got old considering this time she KNEW he was Jesus Christ.  I do like most of Mr. Moore's past work.  I really like him but I think he needs to wait on more inspiration.  Of course it's just my opinion.",1408060800,,448,4.525
6123878,5,B00GXW0CUM,The product was to my satisfaction and would buy from this place again.,1407369600,,71,4.538461538461538

6123880,3,B00GXW0CUM,"Without watching all the videos in the series, it may be hard for someone to understand what all of this is about.  The movie was o.k. and not as good as the others from Kelly's Filmworks.",1405641600,,188,4.222222222222222
6123881,4,B00GXW0CUM,"Shows that there is more to living the Christian life than accepting the ""gift"" of salvation.

6123883,5,B00GXW0CUM,Here is a good movie for church and it makes a lot of sense when you watch it. For you will never get tired of viewing a great film that speaks to the heart .  For me only I wanted to thank Kelly film works for making a great movie to watch.,1403827200,4,241,3.6346153846153846

6123885,4,B00GXW0CUM,"I love all the Stranger movies and TV dramas. Jefferson Moore does a great job of portraying Jesus. This movie had me excited to see what was going to happen from scene to scene. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because of the ending. I was left wondering what happened to Nikki's husband and what her next moves were going to be. Other than that, excellent!!!",1402272000,4,371,4.314285714285714

8628562,5,B00GXW0CUM,Great movie,1484956800,,11,5.0
8628563,2,B00GXW0CUM,"This film was very disappointing.  Up until now, I have loved every single Jefferson Moore film Ive ever seen and it really pains me to be critical of this film.  There are many things that don't work with it.  It lacked the depth that the first 2 Stranger films had.  It seemed very contrived and expository  as if there was just this list of questions pretending to be a plot.  I could see one missed opportunity after the next to get to the heart of the many ways and circumstances that cause people to get burned out and lose their fervor for Christ.  And the question of how to deal with the burn out, doubt, frustration, etc. amounted to just being amazed everyday.

In the first film, I understood Nikkis sarcasm and poor attitude through much of the film.  She wasn't convinced that the man across from her was Jesus.  But in this last film, Nikkis knows perfectly well who it is and her irreverence toward him is to the extreme.  Unlike with the first film, with this one I found myself not rooting for this character at all.  It also seemed to me that the actress who played Nikki was acting/reciting lines rather than embodying the character.  There was also none of the chemistry that existed between Pamela Brumley and Jefferson Moore in that first film.

It also seemed that Jefferson Moore (whom I love) was just plain bored in this film.  There was very little of the spark in him that Ive seen in other films.  As well, the Jesus character seemed little more than a whipping post for the disillusioned Nikki, whereas in the first film, he was the force of change in her journey toward wholeness and healing.  In the end, it just seemed all to ordinary for Jesus to appear to someone in person, with no sense of what an amazing gift/opportunity such an event would be.  If I encountered Jesus for the second time in the flesh, I would sure as anything not ask him where he's been.

I have watched The Perfect Stranger probably 30 times and never get tired of it.  The impact is fresh every single time.  However, I have no desire at all to watch this 3rd installation again.  I would love to see this redone as a quality film like the others.",1483401600,2,2158,4.43765903307888
