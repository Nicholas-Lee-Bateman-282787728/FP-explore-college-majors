7891560,1,6305534497,"This video is of such poor quality and low grade humor, that I actually found myself wishing to have my head crushed rather than watch another minute of it.  It looks and feels like a home movie distributed to the  direct video market.  The acting is terrible and the premise is too lame to  discuss.  I did not find it to be weird in a cool way or artsy either.  It  is pure trash that no one has cleaned up.",951177600,2,409,4.0375
7891561,5,6305534497,"MASKED AVENGER looks like it was produced by some naughty schoolboys who've seen too many Benny Hills. I'm not going to describe the plot because it's too bizarre, but, it goes without saying, that this flick is  different with a capital ""D"".
The main character is a  panty-sniffing killer who tracks down kidnapped babes for his clients. His  reward for finding the babes is money and their panties. Believe me, it's  even stranger than it sounds. I've seen lots of strange flicks in the last  ten years, but this one is right up there with the best.
I hate to admit  it, but I even shed a tear in one scene where the killer is saved by a  little girl. The scene's really touching and I didn't expect that from this  flick. For the gore-lovers there's plenty of gore, and if you're into naked  babes (who isn't?), there's plenty of them, too. But this flick really  kicks rump in the story department and the big surprises department. I  recommend it. Probably would be a Video Nasty in the UK. Certainly better  than a kick in the bollocks, though, and it has some a Japanese style.
I  have heard of the director Mark Savage because he made MARAUDERS a long  time ago. He has also directed a new film called SENSITIVE NEW AGE KILLER,  so says an Aussie film site. I'll be looking out for thatty too.",947376000,3,1301,4.453389830508475
