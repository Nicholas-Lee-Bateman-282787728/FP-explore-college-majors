5709540,5,B00CAE2A0C,"This edition comes with some additional bonus clips which include interviews with S. E. Hinton, Coppola, Swayze, Dillon, Lowe, and all the others who had a role in the making of this. I love how the soundtrack changes and the inclusion of some deleted scenes make an already fantastic film even better.",1416096000,17,302,4.826923076923077

5709543,5,B00CAE2A0C,"I fell in love with this move when we read the book in 7th grade and ever since, I can't stop watching!! I'm really happy I could find the extended version with a bonus CD!",1481932800,,172,3.942857142857143
5709544,2,B00CAE2A0C,"I thought the movie was wondrously cast, it started the careers of so many great young actors, but I found it was so poorly directed, and so many gorgeous moments in the book just fell flat. If you are not a strong actor, Coppola cannot get you there. I've seen it again and again in his films. Also, the addition of the era-appropriate score pummeled the movie.",1476748800,,362,4.417910447761194

5709549,5,B00CAE2A0C,I bought this for my daughter.  We love this movie,1458604800,,50,4.0
5709550,2,B00CAE2A0C,"I bought this to show to a classroom of students. I figured if it is ""truer"" to the novel, that would be better. There's actually MORE in the movie than what is in the novel - including swearing and innuendo that is NOT in the novel.

I double checked the book and searched the digital text for the ""offensive"" language - it's not there.",1456185600,3,337,4.265625
5709551,5,B00CAE2A0C,Bought this for my 18 year old daughter. She has watched it so many times she actually wore the disc out and we had to buy her another one. It still holds up in 2015!!,1450828800,,167,3.8

5709554,4,B00CAE2A0C,"For anyone who read ""The Outsiders"" in school and who watched the movie at the cinema as well, it is a great choice. The added scenes, letterbox presentation and commentary are make it worth the extra cost. Nice to share with my daughter has now read it and watched the film in class.",1446422400,6,284,4.377358490566038
5709555,5,B00CAE2A0C,My family loved this movie.  My 16 and 14 year old daughters read the book and then watched the movie.  Really enjoyed it.,1435017600,2,122,4.260869565217392
5709556,5,B00CAE2A0C,Love that they added the cut scenes. My students loved it even in 2015!!!!,1434758400,4,74,4.357142857142857
5709557,5,B00CAE2A0C,It was excellent. It's true to the book.,1424217600,,40,4.125
5709558,5,B00CAE2A0C,"I give the seller 5 stars, but the music dubbed over the movie was horrible beach movie music and half the time blocked out the actors talking.  The added scenes were great, but like I said, the new music dubbed in ruined the original tone of an awesome movie, and if I had it to choose again I would have bought the old version just to get rid of the bad beach music.",1423699200,5,368,4.041095890410959
5709559,5,B00CAE2A0C,"Great movie! Got it for my 12 year old son, per his request. We watched it together, and  I loved it. In my opinion, every kid should watch it and read the book as well.",1423612800,,169,3.8285714285714287

8579227,1,B00CAE2A0C,"I do not understand how this movie can be so awful with the jam packed cast of stars and award winning director. I bought this movie to show my students after reading the book. I have seen some bad movies in my life, but this one makes the top 5. It is awful.",1505088000,,259,3.9056603773584904

8579229,5,B00CAE2A0C,Great book,1497312000,,10,4.5
8579230,4,B00CAE2A0C,"While I loved the original movie, I have mixed feelings about this extended version.  If Coppola had added new material and left the original parts alone, I would have given it all 5 stars.  Unfortunately, the changes in music were jarring; they took me out of the story in more than one scene.  I was also disappointed in the changes that were made to the opening sequence.  The change took away the similarity with Gone With the Wind's opening sequence, which was a great tribute in the original version.

The extra interviews and commentaries were wonderful, especially the commentary that included Patrick Swayze.  That bonus is why I gave this 4 stars instead of the three I would have given it otherwise.",1495756800,2,710,4.778688524590164
8579231,2,B00CAE2A0C,"disappointed, this was a hard review, I was excited about the extra footage but the music substitution was awful, the original dramatic music during the stabbing, pony and johnny fleeing, the church burning, the rumble, dallas getting killed, all the dramatic scenes, the music was replaced with corny music which took away all of the emotion, intensity, it ruined it for me",1494633600,4,374,5.048387096774194
8579232,5,B00CAE2A0C,This edition is far greater than the original production. It does a much better job at capturing the best of the novel.,1492819200,,119,4.454545454545454
8579233,5,B00CAE2A0C,this is the best thing ever. I read the book a few weeks ago and fell in love. I then watched the original movie and fell in even more love but was sad it didn't have everything.  I found this and it's the best thing to ever happen to me I've watched it so many times. The bonus material is also great.,1491264000,4,302,3.870967741935484
