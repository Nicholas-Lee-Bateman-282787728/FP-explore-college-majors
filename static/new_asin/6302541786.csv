477869,1,6302541786,"Unlike others who have reviewed this story, I find the Caves of Androzani to be the absolute worst Dr. Who I have ever seen.  The masked villian is soooo boring and unrealistic, it almost makes me gag.  I have enjoyed every  Dr. Who episode I have seen up until this one.  I'm really suprised because  the regeneration stories are often the most interesting. I think my main  gripe is with Peri.  I think this story would have been much better if it  had been companionless.  She whines way too much in this one.  Hopefully  this one will grow on me in time.  I suppose anything is possible.",942624000,7,591,4.420560747663552
477870,5,6302541786,"The Caves of Androzani was the most polished and well executed Peter Davison story with some of the shows best ever cliffhangers (episode 1 in particular), and great music. Peri has her work cut out trying to work out  what's going on with the Doctor. The monster in the underground caves is  pretty poor, but it's made up for by the strength of the bad guy Jek.  Essential viewing.",926812800,2,382,4.507246376811594
477871,5,6302541786,"By far the best Peter Davison, and the best Doctor Who story of the 1980s. Everything about it, from the acting to the plot agrees with the viewer very soundly. Every character, from Morgus to the President to Sharez Jek  especially is very well characterized and acted. Nicola Bryant is excellent  as Peri, there's hardly a hint of the unlikable character she would later  become in Colin Baker's era. Peter Davison - what can I say?  He ranged  from engaging to bland to totally unmemorable throughout his tenure as the  Doctor, but he is simply superb in ""The Caves of Androzani"".  Here he gives his best performance ever as the Doctor. The final part is  perfectly shot, and the Doctor's 5th regeneration is by far the best  realised and most emotionally effective and memorable one ever portrayed on  Doctor Who. Kudos to Robert Holmes the writer and Graeme Harper the  director as well for a marvellous tale, one which should have been typical  of the Davison era, not an exception.",923529600,12,988,4.747058823529412
477872,5,6302541786,"If only the rest of the Davison era was as good as this story!
I've always thought Robert Holms was one of the best scriptwriters for the series (an opinion shared by many fans), so it's no wonder that his only  Davison-era script is by far and away the 5th doctor's best.
As in many  Holms' scripts, the characters the Doctor and Peri meet are neither good  nor evil, but merely different shades of grey.  Everyone present has a  score to settle, and in the middle, the Doctor and Peri are caught trying  to find a cure for a disease that will kill them if not treated.
The  story leaves you on the edge of your seat right up to the final scenes when  you realize that the doctor isn't going to make it. Classic stuff.
And I  might as well cast my ballot on this tired topic--yes, this is THE best  regeneration scene of the series, followed only distantly by the 4th  doctor's.
Anyway, if you have not seen this story, you're missing out  on probably the best Doctor Who story of the '80s and therefore one of my  top five all-time!",918000000,,1034,4.295336787564767
477982,3,6302541786,"Not as good as I was expecting.  Peter Davidson was awesome, but Peri was whinier than I remembered. And I guess I have been spoiled by the better production budgets and technology of the new series.",1454112000,,199,4.527777777777778

477986,5,6302541786,"The Caves of Androzani works for many reasons. Graham Harper's director is spot on and the use of locations, particularly dark ones are very atmospheric. We have some great and memorable guest characters. And we have Robert Holmes writing a masterpiece of a script which proved definitely how well Peter Davison could do as the Doctor---if someone gave him good material.

This story is the Doctor at his most heroic as he races the clock to save Peri. On its surface, Caves of Androzani seems to feature the worst types of people drive by greed or insane revenge, and others just seem to kill for fun and the life of one person doesn't matter. There's no good side for the Doctor to be on. The Doctor is the guide side, the one person in this affair who is acting out of something noble: a desire to save his friend and to avoid losing yet another companion after Adric's. The Doctor's heroism makes this a fine farewell for the fifth doctor and one of the best stories of the series.",1425340800,,985,4.5027932960893855

I came away feeling that it's a great story that deserves its ranking, and I only docked it a star because it's special effects have not aged well.  I have long felt that some move should be made to animate these classic stories ala the lost episodes to make them more friendly for the new generation.

477990,5,6302541786,"At risk of sounding like an elitist dingbat, back then, there wasn't need for a final story to feature every single monster ever and loud, gnashing orchestral music to be considered emotional or a good send off. Back then, Doctor Who didn't feel like a blockbuster movie like the new series did. They were given a stupidly low budget and this meant that they had to rely on drama and storytelling for the thing to work, and they succeeded for the most part. I am a fan of NuWho, but I always thiught the classic stories did a much better job at waving goodbye to the Doctor. And possibly the best final story ever comes from my favourite Doctor, unsurprisingly, and also after a string of rather unsatisfying stories

As you could imagine as this is the final story, things are pretty grim. At times when watching Doctor Who I was surprised that back then this was considered kids material, and this is no different, it's a dark and very depressing story. Davison often liked to joke about how depressing this episode really was: after you've been poisoned, yelled at by megalomaniacs, chased by drug smugglers/gunrunners, dodged cave monsters, crash-landed spaceships, and tried to escape the planet quaking beneath your feet, you regenerate into Colin Baker, the REAL downer of it all!

That said, the atmosphere is intense throughout and suspenseful, which is why this story is my favourite. Sharaz Jek is one of the most memorable anti-villains in recent history. He's evil and vicious yet you feel sorry for him, and the mask he wears is terrifying, even if it's a obviously an S&M hood. The corrupt president is terrifying with how ruthless he is. The Doctor and Peri's relationship is suitably intense and the final twenty minutes- easily nerve shredding.

In short, if there's one story you absolutely must watch, it's Caves of Androzani. The four episodes of sheer, unparalleled intensity and suspense may never happen in Doctor Who again. Simply brilliant!",1417046400,,1966,4.880239520958084

I have never seen a more perfect example of a science-fiction show in my life. Peter Davison is one of my favorite Doctors and this is what made him just that.

478024,5,6302541786,"First off, this story is a must-have for serious Dr. Who fans because it ends with another regeneration of The Doctor. As all Whovians know, the ""regeneration stories"" are endings and beginnings rolled into one: the character evolves and a new actor is introduced. However, the script for this specific story is particularly well written and the actors' performances are really first-rate. So apart from the fact that I bought this DVD as a replacement for a poor-quality recording of a TV broadcast, the bridging continuity of the Dr. Who saga, the great plot line, and excellent performances by Davison and Company were all good reasons for my purchase. The first-rate audio and video quality, as well as the appropriateness of the EXTRAS were just added incentives for me.",1383436800,,775,5.015503875968992

It doesn't beat Blink, or most of the Tom Baker ones in the top, or even possibly make it into my top 10.  But it's still excellent, definitely my favorite 5th Doctor story.  I have to admit, I liked it better than Tom Baker's final episode (though that was still good).  It was very tense, what with the clock ticking for both the Doctor & Peri.  His last act of carrying Peri to safety across an exploding landscape is one of the most memorable moments in all of Doctor Who.  A must have for any Doctor Who fan.",1364169600,,690,4.181818181818182
478027,5,6302541786,"So many of the Doctor's swansongs have made valiant attempts to match the intensity, the potency, and dramatic weight of Androzani, but always they fall short. Many recognized writers have tried to analyze what makes ""Caves"" the quintessential regeneration story. You could simply say ""Greame Harper's masterful direction,"" or you could say ""Robert Holmes flawless script."" You could even say ""Peter Davison's no-holds-barred performance"" and you'll more than likely get nods of approval from other Who scholars. However that would be disastrously oversimplifying ""The Caves of Androzani.""

The most interesting aspect to this story lies in the realiztion that when you whittle it all down, The Doctor really has little to no impact on the story. It simply appears that all the events surrounding Sharaz Jek, and Morgus are like a big arrangement of dominoes just poised to collapse, and The Doctor's arrival was that faint, faint breeze that brings it all crashing down. Following that, interestingly, The Doctor's goal isn't to stop the fighting, or end the madness, it's simply to save someone he cares about from his own mistake. It's quite sobering when you realize that all the chaos that transpires in this story comes from The Doctor being curious about what goes on in the caves. It winds up sparking a volatile conflagration, which in the beginning was already at breaking point. It gives a frightening perspective on the idea that The Doctor truly is a dangerous person to know, and he desperately tries to make it not so. To The Doctor, Peri represents, in a fashion ""Innocence in jeopardy."" In the beginning of the story she is interested and eager to see the universe like The Doctor. Her enthusiasm is clearly influenced by The Doctor's. So much so that they recklessly stumble into death itself in the form of Spectrox Toxaemia. You get the vibe that this was a lesson well learned by Peri in her subsequent stories as she became more reluctant and timid.

All of this would paint The Doctor to be a selfish character were it not for the fact that afterwards he goes beyond Hell and back to save her. He dodges bullets, cave monters, mudbursts, asphyxiation, and ultimately leads to him sacrficing himself to save Peri without hesitation. Even when he doubts whether a regeneration would occur. As for the lives lost, it also helps that practically every character the isn't The Doctor and Peri, range from being morally reprehensible to utterly evil. The most sympathetic of the bunch is undoubtedly Sharaz Jek (hautingly portrayed by Christopher Gable) while he is a killer and a terrorist, he is also a man tormented (and ultimately driven) by rage and loneliness. So much so that he kidnaps one of his enemies for companionship. It can even be pointed out that it was said loneliness that saves The Doctor and Peri in the beginning of Part Two. Your inevitable sympathy for Jek is enhanced when you meet the target for his wrath Morgus. In the history of Doctor Who villains, few reach such despicable heights as Morgus. He is absolutely mechanical in his ruthlessness, and conscience is a myth to him. He manipulates as easy as walking, and kills with equal efficiency. It makes the audience root for Jek when his revenge is justified.  It's little aspects to these characters that makes ""Caves arguably one of Robert Holmes masterpieces.

It is known that in Classic-Who a great script doesn't necessarily mean that every aspect of production will be solid. (ie Time Warrior brillant story, great acting, production design, baaaad camerawork and editing.) Well it is in that respect that Greame Harper has become one of the most prolific Directors in the show's long history. Very few directors truly understand how to use their resources to the fullest, and Harper goes beyond them. Caves, is blessed with intimate, gritty camera work, eerily atmospheric sets, and breakneck pacing and it all can be attributed to Harper's confident eye, and ear. On an additional note even the new series can't top the powerful dramatic buildup of The Fifth Doctor's regeneration. Lovingly influenced by The Beatles ""Day in the Life.""

It can be safe to assume that I can go on for hours about the intricacies of ""The Caves of Androzani,"" but it's a safe bet you probably stopped reading at this point. Understandable, considering I'm using a lot of words to say the ""The Caves of Androzani is one of the greatest Doctor Who stories ever and you owe it yourself to buy it."" So I'll simply say ""The Caves of Androzani is one of the greatest Doctor Who stories ever and you owe it yourself to buy it!!!!!!!!!"" with more exclamation marks than necessary.",1351814400,2,4658,4.906091370558376
478028,5,6302541786,"The 5th Doctor's (Peter Davison's) era of Doctor Who, which was produced and televised in the early 1980s has received a great amount of criticism--mainly because he had the misfortune of following Tom Baker's 7 1/2 year run on the programme as the most popular (and familiar, even to Americans) 4th incarnation of the Doctor. The 5th Doctor's stories, however, were quite possibly the most adult and least comical of all (also contributing to the lack of popularity). He regenerated into a youthful, energetic, impatient, athletic, and compassionate sort of character that didn't always win the day as easily as his predecessor would ('Earthshock'/Adric, 'Warriors of the Deep', 'Planet of Fire'/Kamelion). He seemed to be more of a peer and friend to his companions than an elder, and often was willing to make sacrifices ('Mawdryn Undead') and take chances (Turlough & Kamelion) that made the programme more dramatic. 'The Caves of Androzani' was no exception. It is unfortunate that this story, one of the best, would be immediately followed by so many poor scripts. The only poor element to this story is the underground creature (very fake looking-but we are used to this as viewers of the series...lol). The incidental music is also one of the best in the series and a perfect mood setter. The characters are ALL 3 dimensional - a rarity. There are ominous lines and elements scattered throughout. [EXAMPLE: In the beginning Peri, his new travelling companion, mutters to herself after the Doctor marches off breathless with excitement and curiousity to explore the tracks to the caves, ""Is this wise I ask myself? Oh well..."" and runs after him] The Doctor also delivers a secondary explanation for wearing the sprig of celery on his lapel. The ending is emotional for many reasons, but the best is seeing Peter Davison's 5th Doctor be given a satisfactory send off doing what he has always done best - racing against time while carrying his friend in his arms as he (literally) ran for their lives in one last burst of athletic energy, only to discover that things wouldn't be solved so easily once again. This time he would be forced to make the ultimate sacrifice. The regeneration scene is also by far the best of the series.

IN THE TOP 5 FOR DOCTOR WHO! (Other great stories with different Doctors include: 'Genesis of the Daleks', 'Tomb of the Cybermen', 'the Curse of Fenric', and 'the Daemons'. You may also like to try 'The Dalek Invasion of Earth', and 'Vengence on Varos'. Of course, for most fans 'the Five Doctors' is always fun, albeit a little disappointing since it is really 'the FOUR Doctors', and therefore not much greater than 'the Three Doctors' from a decade back...lol).",1332547200,3,2703,4.914660831509847
478029,5,6302541786,"""The Caves of Androzani"" is easily one of the best Doctor Who stories ever made - if not the very best. It boasts a great script by Robert Holmes, exciting direction by Graeme Harper, and Peter Davison's most thoughtful performance as the Doctor. Add to the mix an unusually sympathetic villain in the form of Sharaz Jek, a creepy music score, and a few intense action scenes, and hey presto, you've got a classic.

Of course, if you're a Doctor Who fan, you probably already know all this. So, I should get to the real reason why I'm writing this review, which is to assess the DVD ""special edition"" of this story. The original DVD of ""Caves"" is about 10 years old now, so this new version is being touted as a significant improvement.

Which it is, to an extent. The print on the special edition, while not spectacular (old BBC video footage is never spectacular), is definitely an improvement on any print I've seen before. Certainly, for such a dark serial, it helps to have the picture cleaned up and the black backgrounds made ""blacker."" The sound quality on the new DVD is also very good; in one scene, I could even hear the cloth on the soldiers' uniforms swishing. Still, the source material is quite dated, so don't expect a truly stunning presentation.

The new special features, meanwhile, are my main source of disappointment here. The special edition comes with a new featurette, ""Chain Reaction,"" which covers the making of ""Caves"" in a fairly predictable way. I've been watching similar special features on Doctor Who DVDs for about 10 years now, and at this point, I'm quite familiar with the show's weird production style and the problems it caused. How many times must I hear the actors complain that they had only one or two takes to film a scene, and that the studio was always shut down promptly at 10 PM? To Doctor Who veterans such as myself, these stories are old hat.

I would've been happier if the featurette had instead (or, at least, additionally) addressed the major *themes* of ""Caves"" -- what the story is saying about war, death, the quest for eternal youth, or whatever. Alas, for some odd reason, most Doctor Who fans - apart from maybe Robert Shearman - shy away from discussing themes, and instead get caught up in surface analysis of the episodes. ""Chain Reaction,"" which makes the superficial observation that Harper's direction is energetic about 700 times over, is a prime example of this.

But I guess I'm moaning too much. If you consider the package of special features as a whole -- it also includes shorter featurettes and some period news items -- it's pretty good. I just happen to think that the special edition of ""The Talons of Weng-Chiang"" was handled better, and included more interesting material on that serial's background and historical context. By comparison, the special edition of ""Caves"" is good but pedestrian.",1331164800,6,2873,4.761044176706827
478030,5,6302541786,"[This is the same review I wrote for the previous DVD version of ""The Caves of Androzani"".  I don't really have anything I'd like to add, but I hope this review compels you to purchase this fan-favorite, and hopefully nobody will be bothered by my copy/paste review.]

The best ""Doctor Who"" stories are remembered for being inventive science-fiction stories with unique characters and villainous schemes. But it's rare that a story gets remembered on an emotional level. After all, what can we make of a time traveler who gets into trouble, and doesn't seem to notice how dangerous his meddling can be? As it turns out with ""The Caves of Androzani"", there is some drama buried beneath the adventures through time and space. Peter Davison's turn as The Doctor was underrated for various reasons. Some fans were still getting over their understandable attachment to Tom Baker's 7-year run, while haters couldn't be blamed because many of Davison's stories (IMO) had mediocre writing. But like almost every ""Doctor Who"" fan will tell you, they couldn't have picked a better story to close Davison's tenure in the lead role. It easily Davison's best --- and the actor's personal favorite --- and one of the best ""Doctor Who"" stories in general.

So, why does ""The Caves of Androzani"" work better than most stories? After all, we've seen companions in trouble, villains with evil plots, alien worlds, and even The Doctor dying before. Why is this one special? There are many reasons (of which I'll share a few), but the key reason for me is that every single twist and turn in the plot makes sense 100% of the time. The action sequences (even that rubber-suit dragon creature) all have a purpose, and the characters have motivations that never ring false. People aren't evil just for the sake of being evil, and every character with an ounce of heroism has ulterior motives that may prove to be their undoing. The corporate magnate Morgus and the violent smuggler Stotz aren't just bad guys (though they're pretty sinister); their efforts to control the Spectrox trade and arms dealings all boil down to a greed that we've seen throughout human history. General Chellak indeed has a code of honor when performing his duties to maintain the deadly planet's environmental hazards & illegal trading ring...if only he could control his desire to be remembered as a legendary soldier rather than a corporate lackey. And as twisted as Sharaz Jek's mysteries are, even he earns some sympathy by the very end.

Of course The Doctor and his companion Peri deserve to be recognized as well. I always thought Peri was underrated companion, because people always focused on her American accent and good-looking body. But if you really watch ""The Caves of Androzani"", she plays a much more pivotal role in the story than companions usually do. Even though she begins as The Doctor's tagalong, she's really the only true voice of reason and conscience in the whole story. Even The Doctor can't resist being a little sarcastic with his various captors; as he says early in the story, ""Curiosity has always been my downfall."" What a sad and powerful way to look at the series! The Doctor and Peri's fates are, in a roundabout way, his fault. Plus, who knows if the people on the two Androzani planets might've been better off without The Doctor's recent arrival? When all the characters' fates are met, think on that for a moment.

Although I'm a huge fan of this entire TV franchise, I have to admit that few stories are perfect. Some are 1 or 2 parts too many, some suffer from the show's insanely low budget, etc. ""The Caves of Androzani"", however, is just about perfect with the length, production quality, acting, and storytelling. Case in point (to quote another ""Doctor Who"" fan), just watch the Part 3 cliffhanger and NOT want to watch Part 4. Or, do you wonder how a story involving running around in caves somehow manages to maintain its intensity and intriguing mystery. It's amazing this Fifth Doctor's farewell managed to be this good.

So, diehard fans already know that this is a must-have part of the collection. But if you're new to ""Doctor Who"", and want some good stories to start you off, this one is highly recommended. Don't worry if you haven't seen other Peter Davison stories. Although there are some good ones (""Earthshock"" and ""The Five Doctors"" are a couple personal favorites), most of his stories have mixed reviews at best. But in the final hour, everyone realized how good Peter Davison really was, leaving his successors with larger shoes to fill than some realized. ""The Caves of Androzani"" is a TV classic!",1325462400,6,4620,4.841772151898734
478031,5,6302541786,"When the Fifth Doctor, played by Peter Davison, decided to call it a day, he did so with what is, to date, the best of the ""regeneration"" stories, and one of the best stories period from either the old or new series.

The story focuses on the Doctor and Peri arriving at Androzani, where they find out that, as per usual for places they visit, things aren't going well. There's a bit of a war on between rebels and the corporation that controls the planet. This was in the 1980s, you see, when corporations controlled everything, unlike now where...uh...actually, I don't know how to finish that. Moving on. The Doctor inserts himself into the middle of things, but this time does so at the cost of his own life.

It's an excellent story, and directed by Graeme Harper, who has since gone on to direct several new series episodes. It's really great, and I'm pleased that it's getting a special edition version, as it was one of the earlier DVD releases and was somewhat bare-bones.

The corporate magnate Morgus and the violent smuggler Stotz aren't just bad guys (though they're pretty sinister); their efforts to control the Spectrox trade and arms dealings all boil down to a greed that we've seen throughout human history.  General Chellak indeed has a code of honor when performing his duties to maintain the deadly planet's environmental hazards & illegal trading ring...if only he could control his desire to be remembered as a legendary soldier rather than a corporate lackey.  And as twisted as Sharaz Jek's mysteries are, even he earns some sympathy by the very end.

Of course The Doctor and his companion Peri deserve to be recognized as well.  I always thought Peri was underrated companion, because people always focused on her American accent and good-looking body.  But if you really watch ""The Caves of Androzani"", she plays a much more pivotal role in the story than companions usually do.  Even though she begins as The Doctor's tagalong, she's really the only true voice of reason and conscience in the whole story.  Even The Doctor can't resist being a little sarcastic with his various captors; as he says early in the story, ""Curiosity has always been my downfall.""  What a sad and powerful way to look at the series!  The Doctor and Peri's fates are, in a roundabout way, his fault.  Plus, who knows if the people on the two Androzani planets might've been better off without The Doctor's recent arrival?  When all the characters' fates are met, think on that for a moment.

Although I'm a huge fan of this entire TV franchise, I have to admit that few stories are perfect.  Some are 1 or 2 parts too many, some suffer from the show's insanely low budget, etc.  ""The Caves of Androzani"", however, is just about perfect with the length, production quality, acting, and storytelling.  Case in point (to quote another ""Doctor Who"" fan), just watch the Part 3 cliffhanger and NOT want to watch Part 4.  Or, do you wonder how a story involving running around in caves somehow manages to maintain its intensity and intriguing mystery.  It's amazing this Fifth Doctor's farewell managed to be this good.

So, diehard fans already know that this is a must-have part of the collection.  But if you're new to ""Doctor Who"", and want some good stories to start you off, this one is highly recommended.  Don't worry if you haven't seen other Peter Davison stories.  Although there are some good ones (""Earthshock"" and ""The Five Doctors"" are a couple personal favorites), most of his stories have mixed reviews at best.  But in the final hour, everyone realized how good Peter Davison really was, leaving his successors with larger shoes to fill than some realized.  ""The Caves of Androzani"" is a TV classic!",1299369600,,4384,4.851951547779273
478083,2,6302541786,"I grew up watching Tom Baker's portrayal of The Doctor and I absolutely love the newer series with David Tennant and Matt Smith, so I decided to check out some of the other actors who had portrayed The Doctor.  I purchased ""The Caves of Androzani"" because it is usually listed by fans as one of the best episodes of the Doctor Who series.  While Peter Davidson does a fine job as Dr. Who, his companion Peri (played by Nicola Bryant) is lackluster at best.  Overlooking the special effects (after all it was the 1980's), the story is interesting although the acting by some of the supporting characters is distracting.  The character of Morgus spends much of his time reciting his dialogue while staring directly into the camera like a soap opera character.  I expected to hear the DAH, DAH, DAH! music every time he concluded one of his monologues.  For some reason they have also added an underground monster character (that is completely unnecessary to the plot) who looks just like a plastic armadillo, not scary at all.  Along with this dvd, I also purchased ""The Hand of Fear"" starring Tom Baker and Elizabeth Sladen. In my opinion, it was a far superior story all around (although the special effects are still bad by today's standards).",1278806400,5,1244,4.731481481481482
478084,4,6302541786,"I saw that this episode ranked #1 in a recent Doctor Who magazine poll so I decided to revisit it.  Thinking about this review, I had to decide whether it was worth 3 stars or 4.  In the end, I opted for the latter because overall I was entertained, although this episode is certainly overrated if considered to be #1.

I haven't watched Doctor Who since I was a kid viewing the original PBS broadcast.  Like many I started with Tom Baker but I appreciate what all of the actors who play the doctor bring to the show.  Davison is probably the least humorous and most serious of all of the actors who play the role and knowing this in advance, I don't hold it against him.  In addition, everyone who enjoys this program knows that it was made with no money for special effects, costumes, sets, etc.  Therefore, the story is paramount, which brings me to the problem with this episode...

There are just too many important parts that do not logically make sense.  For example, the first cliffhanger where the Doctor and Peri are executed.  How does Sharez Jek make the swap with the androids?  The only place it could have happened is in the holding cell.  How does he get in?  Wouldn't the doctor have found a way out if possible.  And how does he get the exact replicas made in such short notice, complete with voices and mannerisms...all this in less than an hour!?  None of this is ever explained.  This continues throughout the story, even to the finale that everyone raves about, where the Doctor saves Peri by recovering the milk from the Queen Bat.  The sacrifice is made because the Doctor has only enough milk for Peri...why?  He knows that the sickness causes paralysis so why would he take a chance of being paralyzed before getting the milk to her...why wouldn't he drink some himself first, while he had access to the source?

Don't get me wrong, this is a fast-paced story that keeps the viewer interested and I suppose no longer being a kid, I notice problems which are evident in all episodes.  However, there is a distinct element of contrivance that makes this episode not quite as enjoyable as many others.",1257120000,2,2124,4.554089709762533

478087,4,6302541786,"""The Caves of Androzani"" is a strange beast.  It is both great and goofy.  It features Peter Davison's best performance as the Doctor and what I consider to be one of Nicola Bryant's worst displays as Peri.  It has a very cool anti-hero, Sharaz Jek (wonderfully played by Christopher Gable), who draws sympathy from the viewer and then it has a monster in it that looks like overgrown Texas highway roadkill (In case you don't know what that is, it's an armadillo).  There's a script full of deception, greed, and vengeance and then there's fade-happy direction.  In all, this episode is the best and worst of both worlds.

The story is somewhat uneven.  The serial opens with the Doctor and Peri on Androzani Minor, a fairly uninhabited sandy planet where a drug known as Spectrox is mined.  Mistaken for gunrunners in Sharaz Jek's resistance group, the Doctor and Peri find themselves in front of a firing squad.  With assistance from an unlikely source, they manage to escape and from there the story gets deeper.  We learn the motives behind Jek's actions as well as the more sinister plans of Morgus (John Normington).  Meanwhile, a band of soldiers are trying to find Jek and have to fight off his androids and the aforementioned armadillo of death.  With all of this going on, Jek's gunrunners are in cahoots with the enemy.  Finally, when the Doctor and Peri first entered the caves, they managed to stumble upon some pure spectrox and have three days to live.  Whew, got all that?

It isn't quite as confusing as it seems, and the characters are drawn out very well despite all of the subplots.  Davison pulls out all the stops with his performance, making the Doctor a protective father figure to Peri (perhaps due to the loss of another companion in another serial).  As many have mentioned before, this is his final adventure as the Doctor, and we get to see his regeneration into the sixth Doctor, Colin Baker.  Bryant's accent wavers, especially in Episode 1, and her performance overall is less than stellar.  Still, she runs through a large range of emotions in this serial that makes some of her goofs forgiveable.  Christopher Gable turns in a wonderful performance as the masked Jek, and is rivaled only by John Normington's sinisterly subdued Morgus.  The rest of the cast is fairly solid as well.

The DVD is very good.  There are only a few noticeable blemishes throughout the entire serial.  As always, the special features are excellent.  There are three newscast snippets focusing on Davison's farewell as well as a wonderful documentary on the development of Jek narrated by Gable.  The process of filming the regeneration scene is given a somewhat boring treatment, but it's fun to watch a production happen.  The standard extras are also here, including a photo gallery, a ""Who's Who"" on selected actors and an excellent audio commentary.

Is this the best fifth Doctor story?  Some would argue that it is.  I personally don't think so.  It's weighed down by its direction, sometimes confusing script and a very bad monster.  However, it does feature Davison's best performance, a wonderful villain, an even better anti-hero, and a nice introduction to the Colin Baker era.  Recommended.",1202774400,,3215,4.872693726937269
478088,5,6302541786,"Regretably there is so much garbage on television these days.  There was a time in its history when there were good, decent, intelligent shows on the air.  Dr. Who is amongst one of the few legendary programs of high quality and intelligence that is still on the air.  This particular episode, featuring Peter Davison as the fifth doctor, captures the essence of humility and kindness which unfortunately is lacking from the intellects of our society.  His character was willing to lay down his life for his travel mate.  Scripture teaches that ""no greater love has a man than this that he would lay down his life for his friends.""  Despite incredible intellectual prowess he is still a humble, caring character.  The Christian influence may not have been intentional in the history of the series but it is still a dominant factor in a number of the episodes.  Peter Davison has a natural charisma about him that gives this doctor a very personal, real ambiance.  Regretably he didn't continue the role of the Doctor as this was his final role.  If you want something truly thought-provoking that speaks to the human condition, I highly recommend this episode.  Watch it with discernment, it may open your eyes to our history.",1200700800,,1226,4.846153846153846
478089,4,6302541786,"""The Caves of Androzani"" pivots between the past and the future. Obviously this is so, in that the fifth Doctor becomes mortally ill and newly regenerates into the sixth Doctor after first being haunted by the voices of former companions and enemies. More fundamentally though, this ""Doctor Who"" adventure is a riveting fusion of dystopian science fiction and revenge dramas straight out of the Elizabethan and Jacobean periods--hence doubly dark and gruesome.

The dystopian sci-fi element is more readily apparent, of course, for the human colony on the twin planets of Androzani presents us with a bleak picture of the future--in actuality merely refracting the bleaker trends and tendencies of our present, of course. Exploitative corporations entangled with the government, strict hierarchies of status, an interplanetary drug trade at the heart of a brutal civil war, and cutthroat murderous mercenaries playing (or being played by) both sides--oh brave new world indeed! And an image of this complicatedly dysfunctional social system is painted deftly with a few strokes of dialogue in that inimitable ""Doctor Who"" way (reminding me most clearly of ""The Robots of Death"" or ""The Ribos Operation"" on that score). But closer to the heart of the story is manipulation, intrigue, assassination, insanity, revenge, and an ending where practically everybody (even the Doctor, sort of) dies--and this is good old-fashioned dysfunctionalism vintage 1600's. Morgus's asides to the camera (to the viewing audience, really) are stylistically indicative of this as well, but the secret murder (attempted in this case, of Sharaz Jek by Morgus), the long period of disguise and plotting during which the murderer and the avenger scheme against each other, and the gradually rising body count culminating in an explosion of violence at the conclusion in which the principle characters (including the murderer and the avenger) get killed off--""Androzani"" follows this classic, stereotypically Jacobean dramatic structure almost to a tee.

And it still works. This is a compellingly well-told story with a good deal of suspense, psychodrama, twists & turns, not to mention edge-of-your-seat action in a show not always known for being action-packed per se. The characters are interesting, psychologically complex, and even the nicer of them are less than wholly admirable to say the least--and fine acting by the supporting cast really brings this out. This especially goes for Sharaz Jek, a man driven mad by his disfigurement, resentment, and quest for vengeance--He's cruel, he's creepy, and he's a bit off his rocker, but is he a villain? Well, yes, no, and maybe. Speaking of acting, this is hands down the best performance by Peter Davison as the Doctor that I've yet seen. In all honesty, he tends to be one of my least favorite Doctors and usually comes across (to me anyway) as bland and passive. Not here, though! You can pair him up against the Cybermen, the Daleks, or the Master, but it never quite really seems like the Doctor unless he has that classic irreverence, disdain for petty authority, and understated but rock-solid courage so characteristic of this character across his varying incarnations, and here at last we finally really get to see these qualities in the fifth Doctor. And then he's gone. Dang.

Still, ""Androzani"" does have a few glaring imperfections. Principally, amidst all these interesting characters and fine actors, we have the Doctor's companion, Peri, as played by Nicola Bryant. I'm not sure what happened here, but the character is unconvincing, annoying, and makes Jo Grant look like a Romana in comparison--and the actress can't, well, act. The female companions in ""Doctor Who"" have always been played by excellent  actresses who knew their stuff, and the characters have exuded personality, intelligence (even ditzy Jo had her escapology), and some level of bravery and pluck as well as being extremely easy on the eyes. The latter's about all poor Peri has going for her, I'm afraid. She's trying her best, too, you can tell, so the fault clearly lies elsewhere, the producers and the writers I'm thinking. That aside, there's also a few plot implausibilities here and there and a superfluous monster who's rather poorly realized. But when all's said and done, these flaws detract only a little from a fine story and a smooth production--and a dramatic finale to the fifth Doctor's adventures.",1185408000,,4432,5.220505617977528

Most of the story is about the Doctor and Peri being captured, chased, and tied up. The main villian is uninteresting and the other characters nameless. Not only do they hate the doctor, they fight and betray each other to the point of being ridiculous. People die pointlessly in almost every scene. Skip this one.",1179360000,5,669,4.87719298245614
478091,5,6302541786,"""The Caves Of Androzani"" is the last story to feature Peter Davison as the Fifth Doctor and is not only  the best finale for any of the actors to have played the Doctor but one of the best stories in the show's history. It has been voted very highly by fans in numerous ""Favorite Doctor Who Story"" surveys throughout the years, and when celebrating the show's 40th anniversary in 2003 it reached number one in the official ""Doctor Who"" magazine readers poll of favorite stories.

The Doctor and his new companion, the American botanist student Perpugilliam ""Peri"" Brown, arrive in the Doctor's ship, the TARDIS, on the planet Androzani Minor and investigate some nearby caves. Peri slips and falls into a strange sticky substance which makes her legs sting, and the Doctor helps her brush it off with his hands. Soon blisters appear on Peri's legs and the Doctor's hands and only later do they discover that they have contracted spectrox toxmia, a fatal disease brought about from contact with raw spectrox. When harvested as a drug, however, spectrox at least doubles the life span of humans. From here the Doctor and Peri undertake a perilous quest to seek the one anti-toxin for the disease - the milk from a giant queen bat. Along the way they are hindered by their unwitting involvement in a war between gun runners led by the sinister, masked Sharez Jek who markets the spectrox drug, and Morgus, the head of several conglomerate companies on the neighboring twin planet of Androzani Major. Jek is unstable and full of loathing for Morgus, whom he blames for all his problems. He declares he will stop the war only when he has Morgus's head delivered to him. Morgus on the other hand is under pressure from the President of Androzani Major to end the war quickly to prevent further holding up the delivery of supplies of spectrox.

This story welcomes back one of Doctor Who's best-loved contributors to the series, Robert Holmes as writer. As Script Editor and occasional writer, Holmes was a key element to Doctor Who's success when it was at it's height in the mid 70's. Viewing figures were higher than they had ever been, although some critics felt Holmes and Producer Philip Hinchcliffe went too far in making the show too scary and violent for young children. When both Holmes and Hinchcliffe moved on, a deliberate effort was made to tone down the supposed violence and scariness and the show moved into realms of humor (sometimes over the top) before being restrained by Producer John Nathan-Turner and given a shot of serious, complex hard science. After all of this, Holmes' script for ""The Caves Of Androzani"" is like a breath of fresh air, bringing real darkness, tension and interesting three-dimensional characters back into ""Doctor Who"". There are some wonderful nail-biting moments, particularly the cliffhangers to episodes one and three, and some superb directing from Graeme Harper. The only thing that lets it down slightly is the non-realization of the costume for a creature in the caves called the magma beast, but this is only a small irk. The pace never lets up and the acting is superb, especially by Christopher Gable who steals the show as the villainous but tragic Sharez Jek who wears a mask because he was hideously burned when Morgus trapped him in a mud-burst. He develops a strong infatuation for Peri (where a ""Beauty and the Beast"" scenario unfolds) and Nicola Bryant is excellent in conveying Peri's fear for Jek's unpredictable character, and indeed for the situation she has found herself in. It's a shame that her acting ability was later wasted by reducing her to a whining stooge for Colin Baker's brash and ill-tempered Sixth Doctor to bounce insults and bad moods off.

If you are new to ""Doctor Who"" then this story is a perfect one to start with; but whether you are new to the show or not, this story is a highly enjoyable one and one that will never fail to entertain time and again.",1160697600,2,3938,4.795287187039764

478160,4,6302541786,"Androzani has a reputation with Doctor Who ""fandom"" and critics as being a near-perfect story .  In reality, this is a good story, not great, but probably the most overrated of the 80s (unless anyone rates that McCoy story, The Crappiness Patrol, at all, which would make that one most overrated just for being rated!).  Stories such as Terminus and Time Flight, which fans consider turkeys, were better than Caves of Androzani.

So what do we have here. One of the few stories where the Doctor finds no allies among the guest characters. Everyone is out to kill him.  It's ironic that he can evade a firing squad and machine gun fire from the gun-peddlers but eventually succumbs to an incurable disease.  A story where all the important guest cast is killed off, with the exception of one minor character.  Ressurection Of The Daleks is criticized for its undue violence.  It boggles the mind that Androzani gets a pardon in this respect.  It contains the same violence.  To top it off, even the Doctor ""dies"" in this one.

Bottom line: Caves of Androzani is a good story that keeps you on the edge of your seat throughout, but so does Earthshock.  Earthshock is not considered a classic, and neither should this one. That said, it's still a far better story than anything McCoy could put out.

Based on the numbers coming in on whether or not my review was helpful, I see that The Crappiness Patrol-McCoy apologists have finally made their way to this review.",1145232000,6,1462,4.690196078431373

Eventually the Doctor and Peri wind up in the clutches of a crazed scientist named Sharaz Jek, plus they realise they're dying of Spectrox poisoning.  I won't give away any more than that.

478163,5,6302541786,"The Fifth Doctor and Peri's trip to the sandy Androzani Minor turns out to be a fateful and intensely eventful one in this Dune meets The Phantom of the Opera story.  They explore a cave mouth and encounter a cache of arms enough to equip a small army.  There, they are caught on the scene by the soldiers of General Chellak and condemned to death as gunrunners.
Here's the situation:  Spectrox is a drug that can increase twice the ordinary lifespan.  Demand for the drug shoots up when Sharaz Jek, a robotics expert who is lusting for revenge against Morgus, the man who'd betrayed him, seized the spectrox mines with an army of androids.  The military under Chellak and his subordinate Salateen have been fighting a losing battle against androids, gunrunners led by Stotz, and a carnivorous monster that looks like something out of a Godzilla movie.  Public demand has put pressure on the Androzani president to possibly capitulate to Jek's demands and negotiate an armistice.  Jek's terms?  ""I want the head of Morgus at my feet.  I want the head of that perfidious treacherous degenerate congealed in its own evil blood.""
Well-picked words by Jek, because Morgus is exactly that.  A cold-hearted businessman on Androzani Major whose conglomerate controls the spectrox mines as well as other holdings offworld, and speaks in a cold, low, level, emotionless tone.  His profitmaking goes as far as sabotaging his own mines when an increase in production leads to lower prices and even closing down plants, leaving many unemployed workers being shipped off to labour camps in the East.  As the president tells him, ""the irony is while you've been busy closing planets here in the West, you've been buiilding them in the East, so if the unemployed were sent to the Eastern labour camps, a great many of them will be working for you again, only this time, without payment.""  When Morgus responds with a deadpan ""I hadn't thought of that"" the president, clearly disgusted, replies bitterly, ""Of course you haven't.""
But there's also Stotz, played wonderfully by Maurice Roeves, the nasty and violent leader of machine gun-touting gunrunners supplying Jek with arms in exchange for spectrox.  So who's Stotz's boss on Andro. Major?
The main objective of the Doctor is not to sort out the situation but to save both his life and Peri's.  They are dying of spectrox toxaemia, which they got from accidentally touching raw spectrox, and the antivenin can be found in the oxygenless depths.  Unfortunately, he gets caught up in this violent morass between Jek, the military, and Stotz, while his life and Peri's are slowly ebbing away.
The high casualty rate and violence in this story makes Resurrection Of The Daleks like a summer breeze, but with great dialogue, convincing characters, and great acting, this is one of the best Doctor Who stories.  And this was Peter Davison's personal favourite of his oeuvre.  Christopher Gable as the masked and insanely vengeance-minded Sharaz Jek opposite Nicola Bryant's Peri work as a Phantom and Christine minus the music and opera, especially Peri's shuddering revulsion at being touched by Jek.  His infatuation with Peri turns to genuine concern when she's close to death, making him more than just one-dimensional and not exactly a clearcut villain.  John Normington as Jek's nemesis Morgus, retains perfect vocal control playing a man whose voice rarely rises above a certain level even when he's mad.
Despite his mere three seasons as the Doctor, Peter Davison is at least noted for having one of the best farewell stories of the Doctors.  But his nobility, his urgent and selfless devotion in trying to save Peri, even at the cost of his own life, makes his Doctor the vulnerable Sir Galahad type.  Indeed, his own culpable admission that ""curiosity always has been my downfall"" shows his guilt at dragging Peri into this mess, yet serves as a testament to his moral courage to put things right.",1077580800,27,3940,4.955927051671733

Not only was I entertained, but I was overjoyed to witness my first regeneration of my favorite childhood character. I ran all the way outside to our family jaccuzzi to tell my brother and his friends to hurry and come inside to see that the Doctor had regenerated (just so happens I had the VCR on record that night). It was such an experience to witness the complete mystery of just how the new Doctor would look and behave. This was way before I had even heard the slightest thing about this Colin Baker guy even taking over the roll from ""my"" Doctor, Peter Davison. I soon became just as big a fan of Colin's as Peter's,even with some of fandom's bashing of his tenure in the role. This episode is one that holds a dear place to me in the series. By the way, I met Peter Davison at my first convention here in Georgia (also in 1985), and he was an absolute gentleman! I was completely starstruck.

First and foremost, it marked the peak of the series audience viewing and appreciation figures for the next five years - it was all downhill from here. More importantly, it was arguably the last ambitious and creative story that would be broadcast before the series degenerated into pantomime. The stark contrast between the gripping, emotional story in this episode and the sheer lunacy of Colin Baker's premier, The Twin Dilemma is impossible to ignore.
The scripting, pacing, and performances in this episode are simply brilliant. Peter Davison turns out the best performance of his time, skillfully balancing the Doctor's struggle for his own life with his unwavering impulse to protect the innocent. Superior production values and direction create gritty, edge-of- your seat drama throughout.
With the obligatory extras and the excellent remastering courtesy of The Doctor Who Restoration Team, Caves of Androzani is a five star disc all around. If you can only buy one episode from Peter Davison's era as the Doctor, this should be it.",1052611200,,1106,5.15
478167,5,6302541786,"On so many levels this is the finest Who story and the most memorable of them all when PBS used to show them in serial.
The lighting in the caves is great (it is even explained as natual phosphoresnce in the rock) and the desert landscape of Androzani major is classic; as we find out through the commentary it wasn't hot as it was made to look by bubbling pools of mud and swirling steam winds--it was only 5 degrees. Nicola Bryant who plays Peri winds up getting pneumonia and frostbite. The rubber suited magma creature is ridiculous, but classic Who nonetheless.
As far as cliffhangers go, this story is one of the best. The Doctor narrowly escapes certain death at the end of each episode.
At the end of the fourth episode as the Doctor succombs to the Spectrox poisoning, he wonders is this death. In a way, this was the begining of the end for the show and each regeneration seems to drive the Doctor a little more crazy. The eccentric portrayal of the Doctor by Colin Baker in the insuing incarnation is as motley as his clothes.
This is where to start your Doctor Who DVD collection. Unfortunately the show itself has seen better days at this point and it's a good idea to build your collection backwards from here.",1048204800,,1224,4.493273542600897
478168,2,6302541786,"I have no clue why 'Caves of Androzani' is such a beloved episode. I just watched the DVD to refresh my memory and it was just as I recalled when I first saw it, a pointless story with very little interest, endless running around, terrible effects and sets (although the exteriors are nice) and the patently annoying Peri sidekick, with whom the villain inexplicably falls in love.
The most aggravating thing for me about the story is that the Doctor just 'happens' into it and is basically always on the run, being wrongfully accused, getting poisoned. Obvious holes like 'why is he there in the first place' get glossed over and everyone dies in the end anyway. Even the ... man-in-a-dragon-suit-monster.
The DVD is nicely put together, if for some strange reason you do actually like this episode. Beautiful menus, lots of extra materials, and great clean images.",1047081600,6,866,4.858108108108108

Possibly the best Davison serial, and one of the best serials from the JNT era. JNT recruited long-time Who writer Robert Holmes to pen the last Fifth Doctor story, his familiarity with the program helps tremendously. The production is pretty good, the camera angels and fade-in & out edits give it style, and the gritty atmosphere and high drama rank it above many Who adventures.
Also, the DVD itself is magnificent. The Doctor Who Restoration Team did an admirable job with the transfer and the wonderful extras. Their work on Who VHS and DVD releases have been Top Notch.",1040947200,,807,4.764285714285714

478221,4,6302541786,"I admit it. I was brought up on Doctor Who and I liked all of them util this one. He was not THAT bad though, not compared to who would follow.
I agree that this is the best Peter Davison story and I agree that he certainly pulled out all of the stops for this one but there is still a question which nags at me. Why did he not perform like this before the last story?
Recently I have been buying the Davison stories to add to my collection. I find this dark drama compelling, utilising the Shakespearian performances of the real villan, in contrast to the horror story figure of Sharaz Jek who always reminds me of Vincent price in 'Phantom of the Opera'. The plots within plots and the possibility of the death of the Doctor because of the extreme toxicity of Spectrox add to the heightened interest in this story.
For the DVD the extras are great to have and I have to give credit where credit is due. The BBC are doing a great service to fans of this show by providing, not just these, but the CD releases of missing stories. It does not make up for running the show down or killing it off but all credit to them for adding the extras to the DVDs.

A compelling plot, excellent acting, beautifully designed sets and lighting, terrific location work, lots of terrific bad guys, plenty of shooting, and suspense, suspense, suspense--what more could anyone want? OK, the Magma Creature is cheaply done, but considering the shoestring budget, this is a masterpiece of television production. Peter Davison has finally grown into his characterization of the Doctor in this, his final episode. He shows a full range of emotion, and demonstrates what a fine actor he is capable of being. Nicola Bryant is very strong as Peri and her stammering in terror makes a nice change from the more usual Doctor Who ""screamer"" female companion. The masked, psychotic Sharaz Jek is convincingly portrayed as is the evil corporate chief Morgus. Morgus' occasional, almost Shakespearean asides to the camera are a nice touch. The gun runners are well played and Salateen is just perfectly done. Peter Davison's final scene as the Doctor is one of the truly memorable moments in the series' incredible 26-year run. Except for the afore-mentioned silly-looking Magma Creature, ""Caves of Androzani"" is the perfect episode of Doctor Who. ""Caves of Androzani"" is as necessary to the sci-fi fan as the first episode of ""Star Trek"" or the latest ""Farscape."" Even if you've never seen Doctor Who before, you should see this episode.

Is there any point going into the plot? If you're on this page, you probably know everything about the story anyway so i won't bother. What I will discuss are the extras; these are what make DVDs what they are and unlike many TV shows the BBC knows exactly how to treat their Doctor Who fans. Steve Roberts and the chaps of the restoration team have yet again done a fabulous job in remastering the video, putting together a superb commentary track and a host of interviews and featurettes. These are what makes Who DVDs worth plonking down your [price] for.
Some people have complained about the slow release schedule of these DVDs, but let me ask you, would you prefer vanilla DVDs every month or 6 jam-packed with features event DVDs a year. I know which I prefer.
So raise a pint to Steve and the boys; visit their fabulous website at restoration-team.co.uk and if you work for the people who put out X-Files, Buffy and Star Trek DVDs show them what can be done with a DVD of a nearly 20 year old tv show.",1019520000,3,1215,4.404444444444445
478225,5,6302541786,"Peter Davison's Doctor has gotten a bad rap from many people. It almost seems fashionable in Doctor Who fandom to put down the Fifth Doctor because he was 'weak' or 'too young' or 'not heroic'. I think it's mainly because he's not Tom Baker.  Davison's Doctor made mistakes and was much more 'human' than Tom Baker's superhero portrayal of the Doctor. Peter Davison's Doctor had many great qualities.  His Doctor didn't have the 'larger than life' presence of Tom Baker's Doctor, which put many people off, I think.
A trait shared by all of the Doctors gets the Doctor & Peri into a nice little fix. 'Curiosity's always been my downfall.', the Doctor confesses to Peri as they sit in a cell, awaiting their execution.  The pair are 'rescued' by Sharez Jek, who is played with great flair by dancer Christopher Gable. Although Jek comes off as a mad man, one can't help but feel sympathy for him.
Another great performance is given by John Normington who plays the slimy business man, Morgus.  Normington's Shakespearian asides to the camera send a chill down the spine.
Davison's performance is terrific and Nicola Bryant is quite good as Peri.  Peri is a bit whiny at times, but I suppose I'd be whiny too if I had to climb around in caves wearing very little clothing, got my legs in a fuzzy, sticky, web like substance, and then had some masked mad scientist obsessing over my beauty.
Davison is quite heroic in this story, although he doesn't save the universe or a planet, just his companion, sacrificing himself in the process.
Graeme Harper's direction is great, using all kinds of pans and fades not normally seen in Doctor Who.  Roger Limb's music has a terrific dramatic effect, especially the rattlesnake motif that is used during Jek's scenes.
The DVD package is terrific.  The first 3 person Doctor Who DVD commentary is very enjoyable. It's great to hear about the story from the two leads, as well as director Graeme Harper.  The trio give a lot of insight on the story and seem to enjoy the story a great deal, laughing and applauding the show along the way.
The featurette on the regeneration is terrific.  It's nice to be able to hear the activity on the studio floor or to choose a commentary by the folks who commented on the story.  The featurette on Sharez Jek is also good, incoroporating studio footage, photos of various stages of the makeup process, and an audio interview with Christoper Gable.  Sadly, Gable died a few years ago.
There are also a few trailers, as well as a news fearure from the BBC news and a couple of interviews with Davison shortly after it was announced that he was leaving Doctor Who.
Ah yes, the production subtitles are back, too, dishing out occasional bits of program info.
A terrific DVD and a great story, only let down by the cheesy Magma creature, which is encountered in the caves a few times.
Davison's best story and one that leaves one wishing that Davison had stayed a bit longer.",1019520000,2,2944,4.6531791907514455
478226,5,6302541786,"I'm pleased to announce that the uniformly high quality of the first three States-side ""Doctor Who"" DVD releases was not a fluke.  The newly-offered ""The Caves of Androzani"" is another highly-regarded story given a glossy new, features-packed look.
It's the final story for Peter Davison, the 5th Doctor, and is notably gloomy and dark.  Roger Limb's militaristic score, replete with a rattlesnake motif, and Graeme Harper's inspired direction -- full of cross-fades, matched dissolves, and Shakespearean soliloquies to the camera -- is light-years beyond the dull visual look for which so much ""Who"" is unfortunately remembered.  The script is Robert Holmes at his darkest: a planet run by a mega-corporation is involved in a bitter war against a deformed mad scientist and his android army over supply of a life-preserving drug.  Into this picture stumble the Doctor and Peri, who both contract fatal poisoning within minutes.  The acting is superb, from John Normington's evil-CEO Morgus, who delivers chilling asides to the camera, to former dancer Christopher Gable as the mad Sharaz Jek, stalking the camera (and Peri) in skin-tight leather and a memorable black-and-white mask.
The features are a slight decline from those in the first set of DVD releases.  The raw studio footage of Peter Davison's regeneration scene is tolerable only with Davison and Harper's voiceover commentary -- but the DVD doesn't inform that this track exists over the featurettes as well as over the story.  Similarly, the extended scene (featuring just 20 seonds of new material) works best with this commentary.  The photo gallery and TV trailer strike of tokenism.
Better is a featurette narrated by (the late) Gable, describing the creation of Sharaz Jek: possibly the best original featurette on a DW disc thus far.  Also grand is a 1983 TV interview in which a female reporter tries to bully Davison into admitting that his casting as the Doctor was a mistake!
Harper and Davison's full-length commentary is an absolute riot -- celebrating the story, while poking vicious fun at its (few) plot-holes and visual goofs.  Davison's description of the Part Two cliffhanger is roll-on-the-floor funny.  Nicola Bryant says little, but her regret at Peri's performance in this story is a revelation (considering what awful roles Peri would be assigned when Colin Baker became the Doctor).  Also fine are the pop-up production notes, which describe Holmes's original script in tantalizing detail.  You might not choose to sit through 90 minutes of the music-only sound option, but I enjoyed watching key scenes (including the regeneration) in this fashion.
Overall, one of ""Doctor Who""'s finest TV stories, with a couple of nifty DVD-only additions that make this 20 year-old story a 21st-century triumph.",1018224000,28,2788,5.252252252252252
478227,5,6302541786,"""Caves of Androzani"" is widely regarded as the best story of the fifth Doctor's era, one of the best of the 80's and quite possibly one of the greatest Dr. Who stories of all time.  The late, great Robert Holmes returns to the show after a five year writing absense and delivers possibly his best script in the entire series run (high praise considering that he wrote such classics of Ark in Space, Spearhead from Space and the Deadly Assassin).  The TARDIS materializes on Androzani Minor, where a minor war has broken out over control of Spectrox, one of the galaxy's rarest and most valuable substances.  Sharez-Jek, a reclusive meglomaniac controls the supply and isn't willing to give it up easily.  He's also got an axe to grind with Morgus, the private businessman who has seen the shortage of Spectrox fill his pockets and how is financing both the legitimate armies efforts to stop Jek and his robot army and a small band of mercenaries.  Enter the Doctor and Peri, who get embroiled in a series of events beyond their control and in which there is no easy way out. Holmes takes some standard Who cliches--the lurking monster, the quick accusations of murder--and turned them into one of the most nuanced scripts in the entire Dr. Who canon.  Add to this superb performances by Peter Davison, Christopher Gabel as the deranged Jek and Nicola Bryant's best work as Peri along with Graham Harper's stylish direction and it's easy to see why this story is so well regarded.
But what is to encourage the average fan to pick up this DVD.  The story has been out for years on video.  It's all in the extras.  ""Caves of Androzani"" may be the best of the Who stories released on DVD so far. The supplemental features include a small featurette on Gabel and how he portryaed Jek and the regenaration sequence.  There's also some short clips from various news programs about Davison's departure from the show. But the real treat is an audio commnentary by Davison, Harper and Bryant.  All three are having a ball with the commentary and they all offer a unique insight into story behind the Caves of Androzani.  (If anyone over at Parmount is reading, it's these kind of extras we Trek fans want on our DVDs, thank you!).
So, you've got a superb story remastered--it's never looked or soudned better and a wealth of extras.  This DVD is definitely worth the price of admission.",1017964800,4,2376,4.6826923076923075
478228,5,6302541786,"This DVD is one of the best! There's production subtitles which give you some insight into the making of the story. There's a commentary track with Peter Daviosn, Nicola Bryant, and Director Gramm Harper which is one of the best commentary tracks they've done for a Who DVD. Davison's eye for detail and directorial abilities show through in his comments. He also MST3Ks it a tiny little bit 'How does Peri know they're bombs'. Harper has some useful information and spends a lot of time laughing at Davison's jokes. All three provide a lot of background information as to the actors involved like Robert Glenister who worked with Davison on a show called ""Sink or Swim"", Maurice Roves who went on to play several roles on American TV, and the late Christopher Gable who played Jek. A bonus feature of the DVD serves as a tribute to Gable. It includes audio footage of him describing his role with video footage of his makeup tests. They also fixed a shacky alignment problem with the backround mat in the opening scene when the TARDIS lands. You can see the original shot as an extra feature. This is a really cool DVD.
About the Episode: Perhaps the greatest regeneration story in all of Doctor Who, Caves of Androzani is Doctor Who at it's darkest and most mature. As with most regeneration stories the Doctor spends most of it with the dark specter of death over his head, this is very intense and absorbing. The villain, Sharez Jek, is a brilliant scientist whose flaw for beauty and mental instability are visible despite his great genius. With his robots he is waging a war againts the corporation who seek to mine Spectrox from Androzani minor and the Doctor and Peri are caught in the middle of the military/political struggle. Jek is a spectacular foe, plus his mask is really scary. As the story progresses you realize that, in a way, Jek isn't the real villain. This was that sort of subtlety that marked the Davison era. And the regeneration scene is the best you're going to get in Doctor Who. All the companions surround the Doctor...
About this era of Dr Who: At this point, the show really was trying to be a serious piece of science fiction, like the various Star Trek series. Plots like Earthshock, Frontios, Revelation of the Daleks, Planet of Fire, and this one combined the dark edge of serious plot and story with Peter Davison's dry wit and his very British personality. Davison was the greatest Doctor; young and energetic but with a charisma and intelligence that far surpassed his outward appearance. He was patient, thoughtful, and not afraid to at least try to make the hard decision... Through most of his era, he had multiple companions providing the show with a cast of characters as opposed to a simple Doctor/Companion ensemble.

478269,5,6302541786,"One of my favorite Doctor Who stories ever and Peter Davison's final outing as the Gallifreyan timelord ends on a high note (eclipsing Tom Baker's regeneration sequence in Logopolis).  The plot centers around the Doctor and Peri (played by the lovely Nicola Bryant) who land on Androzani Major, only to find themselves in the midst of a political war between a tyrannical corporation and underground gunrunners led by the sinister masked figure Sharez Jek for control of a precious substance known as Spectrox.  Of particular note is the well scripted story by Who alumnus Robert Holmes who injects dramatic suspense into this four-part regeneration serial and creates one of Doctor Who's most memorable and diabolical villains of the Who canon.  This DVD is a real treat for fans of the series, featuring behind the scenes documentaries on the Creation of Sharez Jek,  The Regeneration Transformation, BBC1 announcing the departure of Peter Davison from the role, an isolated incidental music-only track by composer Roger Limb, extended scene featuring Stotz and his cronies, original opening scene, and a wonderfully recorded commentary track with Peter Davison, Nicola Bryant and Graeme Harper.  The chemistry between Davison and Bryant reuniting for the commentary is superb as they muse about the dated special effects and production anecdotes.  It is a shame that the two of them had only worked together for this serial and the previous episode entitled ""Planet of Fire"" but their brief tenure is regarded so fondly by both and is demonstrated not only by their respective commentaries but also in their performances as well.  The video quality of this DVD transfer is rather limited due to the integrity of the original analog PAL masters with lots of graininess and RF noise throughout, especially during machine gun fire sequences.  The audio is unfortunately mono and a new 5.1 Dolby Digital mix (like the one on The Five Doctors) would have been a plus but is more than made up for by the Special Features provided on the disc.

478275,5,6302541786,"The 5th Doctor's (Peter Davison's) era of Doctor Who, which was produced and televised in the early 1980s has received a great amount of criticism--mainly because he had the misfortune of following Tom Baker's 7 1/2 year run on the programme as the most popular (and familiar, even to Americans) 4th incarnation of the Doctor. The 5th Doctor's stories, however, were quite possibly the most adult and least comical of all (also contributing to the lack of popularity). He regenerated into a youthful, energetic, impatient, athletic, and compassionate sort of character that didn't always win the day as easily as his predecessor would ('Earthshock'/Adric, 'Warriors of the Deep', 'Planet of Fire'/Kamelion). He seemed to be more of a peer and friend to his companions than an elder, and often was willing to make sacrifices ('Mawdryn Undead') and take chances (Turlough & Kamelion) that made the programme more dramatic. 'The Caves of Androzani' was no exception. It is unfortunate that this story, one of the best, would be immediately followed by so many poor scripts. The only poor element to this story is the underground creature (very fake looking-but we are used to this as viewers of the series...lol). The incidental music is also one of the best in the series and a perfect mood setter. The characters are ALL 3 dimensional - a rarity. There are ominous lines and elements scattered throughout. [EXAMPLE: In the beginning Peri, his new travelling companion, mutters to herself after the Doctor marches off breathless with excitement and curiousity to explore the tracks to the caves, ""Is this wise I ask myself? Oh well..."" and runs after him] The Doctor also delivers a secondary explanation for wearing the sprig of celery on his lapel. The ending is emotional for many reasons, but the best is seeing Peter Davison's 5th Doctor be given a satisfactory send off doing what he has always done best - racing against time while carrying his friend in his arms as he (literally) ran for their lives in one last burst of athletic energy, only to discover that things wouldn't be solved so easily once again. This time he would be forced to make the ultimate sacrifice. The regeneration scene is also by far the best of the series. IN THE TOP 5 FOR DOCTOR WHO! (Other great stories with different Doctors include: 'Genesis of the Daleks', 'Tomb of the Cybermen', 'the Curse of Fenric', and 'the Daemons'. You may also like to try 'The Dalek Invasion of Earth', and 'Vengence on Varos'.

7827352,5,6302541786,"A great story for the 5th Doctor's departure which was written by the one of the best Doctor Who writers, Robert Holmes, It was suspenseful and well acted. A few minor directing ""mistakes"" actually improved the show such as Morgus making aside comments directly to the camera as though revealing his thoughts directly to the viewer.

This is probably the best Peter Davison story overall and definitely ranks in the top 10 of all the classic episodes in my book.",1458604800,2,462,4.775
