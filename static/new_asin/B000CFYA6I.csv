This has happened to me multiple times when I was looking for older titles.
Now the movie itself:
This is a classic thriller from 2 decades ago which never gets old.
It has an excellent script, semi perfect dialogues with a few laughable cheesy scenes which the editing team failed to catch.
The direction is slick and efficient. Movie is fast paced from start to finish.
The action scenes are well choreographed
The cinematography is ahead of its time for a work that was done 20 years ago.  The outdoor locales used during the songs are some of the most beautiful shot to date.  Even though the sound track was one of a kind, I found the choreography to be very strange.
One of the major factors in its success without a doubt was the music; can't picture it on any other film and have not heard anything like it to date.
The performances by all star cast were pretty much flawless.
Personally love Bobby Deol and have to praise him for choosing this film.  Can't picture any other past or present actor that could have pulled it off.  He plays the rich spoiled brat with such perfection that it's hard to imagine any other actor playing the role.
Overall it's one of best movies of the 90s.",1456358400,,1407,4.4765625

Apart from the fact that what seemed fascinating at age 16 now seems funny 13 years later, I was very very disappointed in the quality. Maybe these things don't scale good to LCD screens but still this is the worst ""original"" DVD print I have ever seen. The whole thing looks grainy and I remember it looking much better when I first saw it in the VHS format, even though the screen was much worse.

DVD navigation is a joke too. If you select a song, the movie continues after it is done. So I can't just watch all songs in a playlist.

Finally, the movie is preceded and followed by crappy ads/trailers for other stuff available on DVD.

The whole DVD looks poorly produced. Will think twice before buying a EROS entertainment product again.",1280361600,2,936,4.488235294117647
