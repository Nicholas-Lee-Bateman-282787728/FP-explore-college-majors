2534457,5,B000EU1Q4U,"This is better than just buying the plain old DVD. I wish BBC had done all the previous series' with an on pack addition.

You can't get any better than Red Dwarf. One of the best, if not the best, shows ever. This is the last series until the movie comes out. Enjoy it!!!",1151193600,,272,4.037037037037037
2534458,4,B000EU1Q4U,"Series VII was lacking in that it tried to give us 7 ""epic"" stories that go deeper into sci-fi and really try to put Red Dwarf on a new level.

The problem is, RD has always been a send-up of sci-fi, with the occasional poking of itself as well.  And now it's using it as core material while taking itself seriously.  This ""internal cultureshock"" is bad enough, but it's as much insulting as anything else given the sheer drop in quality of the stories themselves.  Few of which came across convincingly as epic, fewer of them were funny, and even the biggest gags (Rimmer and Lister kissing) still look forced.  Never mind the phony film effect applied to the video that doesn't work...  (""Blue"" being, by far, the best episode of Series 7...)

But why am I talking about series 7?  Simple.  To show how much better 8 is.  Despite having a ship full of crew, the series feels more at home than its immediate predecessor.  Of course, the reason for having the ship back also means we should be seeing an extra Lister and Kochanski about, and the idea of which would have prevented the wrong stories getting too much padding and unwarranted screen time.

""Back in the Red"" is the 3-part opener that's a bit long (try 2-parts instead, if only I could go back in time then afford a plane ticket to the UK so I could talk with the production team :-)  ), but at least it is pokes fun at itself with ""the Dibbley family"".  Things get long once we start seeing dancing Blue Midgets and a little too long Cat physical exam...  but it's reasonably good, and genuinely moving in parts.  Definitely better than anything series 7 vomited up.  If only they addressed the doubles for Kochanski and Lister.

""Cassandra"" is an instant classic and the most ""old-school"" Dwarf of the bunch.  And intelligent in its writing.  Most refreshing from the usual ""physical comedy""...

""Krytie TV"" is a bit raunchy, but is great fun too.

""Pete"" is about 28 minutes too long and is easily the worst story presented.  It's about a dinosaur that gets really big and does big dinosaur things.  As this is ""Red Dwarf"", you can probably guess at half the jokes and the repetition of the jokes used...  Just think ""'Family Guy' only 7 years earlier"" then barf.

""Only the Good"" is about 28 minutes too short and had the potential to be the best of this series, if not one of the top 3 stories of RD ever.  The concepts used are brilliant.  Unfortunately, this one is worthy as a 2-parter for the exposition and quality of jokes alone.  (which might be why it was shoehorned into a standard episode length.  :(  )  But it ends on one helluva cliffhanger, which would otherwise beat out ""Out of Time""'s cliffhanger except that story wasn't overloaded with ideas and as such could set everything up properly within its allotted time.

As usual, we have a rich plethora of extras - alone making every series of RD worth purchasing.  Even RD VII.  It's good seeing the cast again, and I must say Craig Charles has aged well.  (of course, that cooking show knock-off that was in the series 4 release (Can't Smeg Won't Smeg) would have been more appropriate here...

But at least 8 ends it all on a good note.  It's been over 7 years since the cliffhanger, and I think the show has had its day.  :(",1147564800,4,3260,4.488926746166951
2534459,4,B000EU1Q4U,"As my title says, I think the storylines were pretty good, but a lot of the gags were recycled junior high stuff.  Doug Naylor wrote most of it, and there is only one other credited writer on two episodes.  Maybe he could have used some help.  Extras were pretty good, as they are on all the DVDs in this series.  Maybe not the best Red Dwarf, but better than a lot of other stuff that gets on TV.",1147046400,,397,4.051282051282051
2534460,4,B000EU1Q4U,"When series  came out on tv my first impressions is that it was  pretty poor.

Getting on dvd and watching it again i know i was wrong. This is a funny series with some really great moments. I think my problem at the time was it just feels less like the great series such as 3 and 6. If you can put the thoughts of previous series out your mind then you can appreciate how good this series is.

Of course the episodes are good but its the extras that have got me real excited.

The making as in the previous series is first class with the standard interviews and episode information. The deleted scenes are outstanding this series far far better then in any of the previous series. In previous series you could see easily why they were cut with this series there are many that would have deserved a place in the full show its over 1hrs worth of stuff and also the alternate ending that was going to be used

Having now got all the series this for me makes a fine finish and more then makes up for series 7

Lets just hope the film they keep mentioning soon gets into production or one final series",1146096000,,1097,4.195238095238095
2534461,5,B000EU1Q4U,"Finally Season eight is out on DVD, and though I am aware of a lot of criticism about this particular series I have to confess it is one of my favourites along with Series seven.

Who cannot laugh like a drain when they watch Pete the sparrow turn into a T-Rex and the cow vindaloo sketch with the hilarious American actor Mac MacDonald as Captain Hollister telling the Rimmer and Lister EXACTLY what happens if you feed a T-Rex, cola, ice cream and cow vindaloo.

I also like the fact that Red Dwarf now has a wider appeal to a female audience with Chloe Annett taking over the role of Dave Lister's long suffering girlfriend Kristine Kochanski and the episodes where Kryten is designated as a female because he has no male parts is side splittingly funny and gives a new meaning the term a warped kind of chick flick!

The Cat and Holly are on great form, with Danny John Jules bringing back to live Dwayne Dibbley and the Dibbley family, who can forget the scene with him and Finally Season eight is on DVD, and though I am aware of a lot of criticim about this particular series I have to confess, this and Series seven are my favourites.

The extras are great too, an added bonus I agree but for me what makes this series as good as it is, is having all the episodes in one box so that I can sit down whenever I want and laugh myself into a coma!",1145664000,9,1351,4.265625
2534462,4,B000EU1Q4U,"I'd never seen the 8th series of Red Dwarf. And judging by all the reviews I'd heard about it saying it was the weakest series of them all, I wasn't looking forward to buying it at all.

But after watching it, I have no idea what anyone is on about? It's as great as any other series, it's gone back to it's roots, the entire cast is back in force and it has plenty of classic moments.

This time around they have gone back to the non-film looking footage, and back to a live audience. There is plenty of laughs and the series goes out on a high... leaving you just begging for a 9th series.

The nano-bots from series 7 have reconstructed Red Dwarf, but they have also reconstructed the crew. So it's almost like its time travelled back to where Red Dwarf all begun, only it hasn't, and leaves many interesting possibilities to explore showing that the series isn't lost for idea's, it in fact ingeniously proves it's far from it.

The bonus features are what's been seen on the other series DVD releases. Out-takes, deleted stuff, story boards ect...

There are two Eggs to be found. One on disc two where you select the subtitles and push left and navigate through the elevator buttons to about the 3rd last one on the right side (13th button, I think)

The other egg is on disc 3; If you select Bonus Material, when the screen is panning to the right, press up and you will select the button on the door.

TIP: If you purchase this, may i recomend you don't just click on PLAY ALL and instead go to the chapter selections and make sure you choose the full and uncut movie length version of ""Back In The Red"" to kick it off with.

May the smeg be with you",1145664000,,1658,4.291666666666667
2534463,3,B000EU1Q4U,"I give season 8 a 3-star rating, which is relative to other tv shows.  Compared to Red Dwarf at its finest (seasons 1-5), I think it's barely a 2.

By season 8 the show was only a pale shadow of its former self.  I'm shocked at how un-funny it is.  Also, the actors have noticeably aged...their characters are meant to be twenty-something not, middle-aged.

Back in the early 90s, Chris Barrie said he hoped Red Dwarf would have a ""proper ending"", i.e., wouldn't go on unnecessarily.  Sadly, that didn't come about due to the long gap between seasons 6 and 7 and the enormous popularity of the series.  It's a real shame that season 8 is apparently the end of Red Dwarf, since the long-anticipated movie probably won't happen now (and I think the tv cast are too old for it now anyway).  Red Dwarf RIP (1988-1999) :(",1145491200,8,816,4.466216216216216
2534464,3,B000EU1Q4U,"After series 7, series co creator and writer Doug Naylor decided to take the show back to it's roots with series 8. First setting it back on Red Dwarf and reviveing the entire original crew. There are some great comedy moments in this season but most of the time i felt as though i was watching a half arsed version of the great comedy classic. You would think with Rimmer and Holly back along with the Skutters that the show would go right back to it's comedy roots but unfortunatly it all seems wrong somehow. The jokes don't feel as witty or as clever as the other series, in fact i found some of the jokes to be embarassing and painfully unfunny. All in all series 8 is a big let down. Thankfully the BBC appeared to have delivered the goods once again with the DVD extras so it's not all bad news and there are some good episodes in here such as 'Cassandra' and 'Krytie TV' which are two of my personal favourites from this season.",1142985600,10,936,4.293785310734464
2534465,4,B000EU1Q4U,"Red Dwarf VIII, the last Red Dwarf series produced for television, is so far off the original premise and comedic style of the first few series of the show that in many ways it seems like a completely different show. Having an entire ship full of people with whom Lister can interact really shatters the great comedic premise on which Red Dwarf was created, that being that Lister is the last human left in the universe. Personally, I've never enjoyed the premise of bringing back the entire crew and then putting the main characters in prison for nearly the full eight episodes. While amusing, I believe this series has a lot of unwelcome changes and writing difficulties compared to earlier series of the show. The humor is less dense and less clever, often relying on gags that do not even approach the level of razor-edged wit prevalent in earlier episodes of the show.

Nevertheless, there are a few bright spots in this series. Chris Barrie is back and the full cast of regulars is present for the entire series. And there is some occasionally inspired humor that still manages to make this better than most of the other shows on television. Cassandra particularly stands out as a good, ""classic"" Red Dwarf episode.

Finally, the extra features, as on the other Red Dwarf DVD sets, are terrific, with Smeg Ups, deleted scenes, extended versions of two episodes, a making of documentary, commentary tracks, and much more.  The extra features alone are worth the price for any ""serious"" Red Dwarf fan. Based on that alone, I would recommend this set. Plus, what Red Dwarf fan can resist completing their collection? Sadly, as of this writing, Series VIII is the last Red Dwarf ever produced.

Here is a synopsis of the plot of each episode in this set:

Back In The Red Part I

Kryten's nanobots have recreated the ship Red Dwarf and the original crew as well, which is an especially good thing for Arnold Rimmer.

Back In The Red Part II

Rimmer uses a virus that enhances sexual magnetism to assist him with attracting female crewmembers, but this gets him into trouble when he dines at the captain's table.

Back In The Red Part III

Lister and his bunch face time in the brig for crimes against the Space Corps., so they escape to try and prove their innocence.

Cassandra

Lister joins a special military unit comprised of convicts, only to discover it's basically a suicide squad. Things get interesting when they face the all-knowing Cassandra. This episode is the one in Series VIII that is the most like a classic Red Dwarf episode from earlier series of the show; it is cleverly written and hilarious.

Krytie TV

Kryten's private TV station is most amusing to his fellow prisoners, but the jokes are at the expense of others, which gets him into a bit of trouble.

Pete Part I

Rimmer and Lister are forced play against the guards in a basketball game. They sabotage the opposition's half-time juice with a virility enhancement drug.

Pete Part II

The crew becomes the prey when a sparrow devolves into one of its large dinosaur ancestors.

Only The Good

Rimmer passes into a parallel universe where his other self is the ship's captain.",1142812800,48,3154,4.720802919708029

On a fundamental level I don't really like the idea of bringing not only Red Dwarf, but also the entire crew, back from the dead.

It does manage to capture that trapped submarine feel of the first two series, without all the grey. The performances are spot on and it's great to have the original Holly back.

I cannot go into details about every episode and what it contains, but I can say I was pleasantly surprised and enjoyed this thoroughly.  The person I bought this for had every season prior to this one.  Once I showed even a tiny spark of interest in it, I was roped into watching them all.  Definitely worth it!

Though this was purchased a while ago, I am just now getting a chance to review it.  The packaging was great and it arrived quicker than I had imagined - in plenty of time for Christmas.

But that's not all, the nanaites that left Kryten to explore the insides of Lister's underwear hamper to restore the ship have brought the orginal crew back as well. However they haven't a clue what is going on. Lister and the crew are brought up on charges by the captain and tries in vain to explain to them that they are in deep space and three million years away from Earth. The only one who is even willing to listen to them is Arnold J. Rimmer. Yes that's right Rimmer is back and he's still a smeg head hologram or real. The only way Rimmer is going to help Lister and the others is to get an edge. Lister gives him a disc with information on everyone and Rimmer checks out the wreckage of the Starbug and finds the luck virus and sexual magnetism. Rimmer is in for one crazy ride.  The trial has found them innocnet of the charges however they have wound up in the brig for giving Rimmer information on the crew and must serve a three year sentence in the ""tank"" the prison level of Red Dwarf. While inside Lister has signed them all up to be canries the prison fighting force that goes in and gets the job done or at least try. Thier first mission is to a wrecked ship on a water planet where they meet Cassandra a computer system so advanced it predicts the future. Cassandra has predicted Rimmers death and Rimmer of course will do anything to ensure that doesn't happen. Kryten hates being in the womens wing of the prison and some of the male inmates catch wind of this and reprogram him so he can show the male prisoners what they are missing.  Lister and Rimmer have gotten into trouble a number of times with the captain and they just don't seem to be catching a break. That is until Cat, Kochanski and Kryten come back from a mission with a time wand that could solve all of thier prison time troubles. But as well all know things never go easy for the crew as they learn first hand that messing with time can be dangerous. A virus designed to eat metal has been brought on board and begins to destroy Red Dwarf slowly. The crew abondons Red Dwarf leaving Lister, Cat, Kryten, Rimmer and Kochanski to figure this out with time running low. A chance idea to send one of them to a mirror universe to find a solution and maybe save Red Dwarf.

2534510,5,B000EU1Q4U,The entire Red Dwarf Series is a very witty sitcom and tremendous fun to watch.  I would definitely recommend it for anyone who has a good sense of humor.,1289692800,,154,4.310344827586207
2534511,4,B000EU1Q4U,"I've been a fan of Red Dwarf since those deep dark days of the late 80s when I saw the first year's episodes on my local PBS station. Felix and Oscar meet Dr. Who. The cast eventually turned into Felix and Oscar's poker game, with one of the Pidgeon Sisters sitting in. And this is what we're dealing with here.... After all their screwy, inventive adventures of the previous seven years, after the destruction or loss of the original Dwarf, the ship is reconstituted again by mysterious nanobots, with the original crew, including the REAL Rimmer, their CO, Peterson, Kachansky and everyone in one last season as the crew AGAIN causes the destruction of Red Dwarf and it's crew. Lister, Rimmer, Kachansky and Kryten get imprisoned for INITIALLY causing Red Dwarf's destruction, (even though Lister, Kryten and Kachansky had nothing to do with it!) and proceed to compound this by 1) escaping confinement 2) causing the devolution of a harmless canary into a T. Rex, 3) Having Kryten film the girls on the Dwarf showering naked and 4) consistently breaking minor infractions until their CO loses his mind, and 5) ultimately cause the destruction of Red Dwarf yet AGAIN!

How the writers of this series came up with even the six stories a season they HAD of this program is beyond me! Some of the most inventive plotlines and situations you will ever see on series TV have come from Red Dwarf writers! It's as if the DC Comics bullpen, the writers from ""The Big Bang Theory"" and Dr. Who got together to produce a live action sci-fi comedy. Lister is the ultimate, regular-guy slob, and Rimmer is the ultimate deflatable anal-retentive know-it-all, with the ACTUAL fount of knowledge Kryten and the vain and stupid cat as counterpoints, along with the rethought Kachansky for distaff comedy. (Frankly, I preferred Claire Grogan to Chl&ouml;e Arnett, but what can you do?)

This is the season that leaves a possible continuation open, despite the gruesome last scene of Rimmer seemingly being obliterated after the mysterious disappearance of his friends. Sets kept changing year after year, and the sets for this year gave the writers new directions to work with, which they did, using the brig setting to play new characters off of the regular crew. Funny, as usual....maybe not as funny as the landmark fifth season, which had so MANY brilliant episodes, but still not bad for eight seasons.

Now, when the heck is that MOVIE coming out?",1283644800,,2437,4.867469879518072
2534512,3,B000EU1Q4U,"Some fans of RED DWARF were truly upset by the changes in Seasons Seven and Eight of the show.  In Season Seven Rimmer played a much smaller role while in Eight he was no longer a hologram.  Chlo Annett joined the show as Lister's former girlfriend Kristine Kochanski and while she did a nice job, she broke up the all boys club of the first six seasons.  In Season Seven the action was on the Space Bug while on Season Eight they finally get back to Red Dwarf, but one on which nanobots had restored all of the former crew members that had died in the show's first episode.  But while all of these represented major changes, the most important was the breakup of the Doug Naylor and Rob Grant writing team.  Grant did not continue with the show and whether because of that or whatever, the comic tone of the show changed dramatically.  As Craig Charles expressed it in an interview in the special features disc, the show ceased to be more of a sitcom and became more of a dramatic comedy.

I can't count myself among the more fanatic RED DWARF fans.  I find it moderately entertaining and moderately funny in its best seasons, but perhaps because I was not among its biggest fans, the changes in the final two seasons bothered me a lot less than it seems to have done others.  There wasn't as much at stake for me as there was for others.  But I had no trouble finding large swathes of it to be quite humorous.  Interestingly, even though Chris Barrie (Rimmer) was not a fulltime cast member in Season Seven (or perhaps because he wasn't fulltime and they were determined to make his moments as funny as possible) the funniest moments in the season belonged to Rimmer.  The Season Seven second episode gave Rimmer a bit of a farewell by having Barrie play Ace Rimmer, and it was one of Chris Barrie's best episodes ever.  Then later in the season the Star Bug's crew undergoes ""The Rimmer Experience,"" which is nothing so much as a Rimmer musical puppet show.  For my moment, that is the single funniest moment in the history of the series.

Season Seven was on Star Bug, but the bulk of Season Eight was on the newly reconstituted Red Dwarf.  I commend the producers for wanting to do something different, but frankly it just didn't feel like RED DWARF with a full crew.  Nor did it feel quite right with Rimmer being a human being rather than a hologram.  There were also fewer truly funny moments. Though both seasons suffered from having less brilliant dialogue than the first six seasons when Rob Grant and Doug Naylor were crafting the scripts.  The first six seasons were always more about talk and brilliant dialogue, while the next two seasons relied more on situational and visual humor as well as extended gags.

All in all, I'm glad that Seasons Seven and Eight were made rather than not made.  They aren't quite as good as Seasons Three through Six (the first two, prior to Kryten's joining the show, simply weren't up to the level of what came after).  Still, there were many good moments.",1246579200,2,3004,4.524074074074074

2534514,5,B000EU1Q4U,"I love Red Dwarf. Seasons 5-7 were getting a bit lame (not horrible, but not as good as previous), but this (last?) season picks it back up and freshens all the jokes back up again. Very good season and good DVD.",1209340800,,212,4.195121951219512
2534515,4,B000EU1Q4U,"Not a review but I love the series. I own up to season 6 and have to say each season is better then the prior. 6 was a delite!
My beef is why the price increase for the US DVD's. Amazon UK sells the UK versions for half the price we have to pay in the US. For instance 1-3 convert to be $14 USD each, 4 is $16, 5 is $17, 6 is $19, 7-8 are $23 each. Also they have a DVD set that is just the shows. 1-4 of this is only $20! 5-8 is $60. So for $80, you can purchase just the shows.
They do have a 17.5% tax rate but that is their tax and goes to their government so it not part of this discussion.
Lastly, what is the deal with the combo 7-8 pack for $81? Do you think we can't add? 7 is $35 and 8 is $35 = $70. Why is the combo $11 more?

Really, it's not as bad as some reviews would have you believe. The writing is not as crisp as in the previous series, and I wasn't entirely thrilled with the ""resurrect the crew and throw the gang in prison""  plot line.
But it has it's moments, and it's still worth watching if you've seen the rest of the series.",1189209600,,431,4.130952380952381
