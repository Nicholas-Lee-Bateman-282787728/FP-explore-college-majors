8621675,5,B00GB0OS8S,"Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes (Daniel Bryan style). I love those two henchmen of Doronjo. Anime could be the perfect idea for my second movie ""The Cartoon Theory 2: Here We Go, Again"".",1432080000,,178,4.264705882352941

Was really happy about remake of it",1414627200,,44,4.0
8621677,1,B00GB0OS8S,"I found this in a local used shop for $2.50 back in 08 and just found where I buried it tonight so I tossed it in the player@!
BRACKKKK!!!!!!!!!!  is about all I can say for it  or YUCK!!!!!!!!!!
I picked it up because it said guest appearance by Gatchaman.....Ya I'm a battle of the Planets fan; so at the price I figured what the heck.....the BOTP bits were stupid!!!!!!!!!!!
Speed Racer driving thru in the Mach 5 wasn't bad but to say this dvd has any remote redeeming qualities there are none that I could see.

BUT
if you really want this dvd go and pick up the 2005 version it's allot cheaper and it' the same thing!
Why waste more than enough money for this specific DVD Version.",1399334400,2,687,4.269230769230769
8621678,4,B00GB0OS8S,"I'm writing this review because the Amazon description is just a bit vague.
  Time Bokan: Royal Revival is a 2 part OVA homage, not one of the original series. consisting of 2 episodes

  **** Time Bokan Royal Revival I - Chikichiki Ugougo Bogeboge Machine Wild Race ****  Welcome to the anime version of Hanna Barbara's wacky racers.  Evil doers only. When all the racers are cheaters... some cheater has just got to win... right. 30 min.

and

  ****Time Bokan Royal Revival II - Alumni Reunion in the Tatsunokon Kingdom.  -  This is True Yatterman style, Time Bokan battle.  Giant robots who just won't stay down.  Flashing super heroes in Pose after Pose.  Evil plots, Heroic speeches, last minute rescues...and a cameo by Speed Racers ""Mach 5""...... getting trashed.  You may laugh, you may cry, you may start banging your head into the wall, but its some good old school anime fun.

While time bokan is normally for young children, these episodes are slightly pg-13, the first episode has several comedic adult references, while the second features several ripped female costumes, while its tasteful and all nipples are covered, there are several female skin shots where large portions of the breasts are exposed.",1391299200,4,1219,4.9504950495049505
