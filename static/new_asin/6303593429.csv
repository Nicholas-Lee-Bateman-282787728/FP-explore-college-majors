Even the 'deus ex machina' ending, reportedly crafted not to enrage the current monarch, has my favorite line of the play ""Ce n'est vous que j'envais rendre raison"".""I shall not explain why to you""!!",1510531200,,362,4.950819672131147
7851281,1,6303593429,"This film was obviously rated high so that the sellers could sell it for an exhorbitant price.  I was embarassed to show it to my students.  We laughed our way through it.  I should rate it highly so as to resell it, but I wouldn't do that to my worst enemy if I had one.",1354752000,,271,3.890909090909091
7851282,5,6303593429,"One of the lesser known Gerard Depardieu films is his portrayal of the hypocrite Tartuffe who worms his way into a bourgeois family for sex and profit.  This is the famous Moliere play by a superb French cast. Don't forget to listen to the beautiful French which is done in poetic verse. The film starts out slowly but by the middle I was enraptured by Depardieu's clever portrayal of a true charlatan who speaks in such pious verse yet has only base motives at heart.  If you like this film, don't miss Depardieu's masterful Count of Monte Cristo.",1132617600,3,548,4.581632653061225
7851283,5,6303593429,"This is a splendid adptation about the famous character, pregant of this double moral and sense of the opportunity. All the ugliness you can imagine and still more is treated with eloquence and superb heart rendition.

Depardieu made one of his sublime performances in all his brilliant career. This adaptaion is made with resources economy , but what a passion and delightful of the spirit's maaning.

Alejandro Casona, a famous Spanish writer told once that there wasn't any serious issue that it can be told in a funny style. That's the clue for that overwheming and outstanding performance. Depardieu also directed and conceived the artistic direction. A real tour de force and definitively an artistic triumph all the way.

A must for you to acquire this. I recorded it from TV cable and then I acquired in this format. I will be one of the first on the line when this work be released in DVD format. A feast for your eyes, soul, spirit and intellect!",1112832000,3,956,4.746987951807229
7851284,5,6303593429,"This is one of the best comedies ever written. It is certainly, one of my favorites. I have read this play in French and English translations. I have studied it and even seen it performed by the Comedie Francaise.  This movie version is superb. Amazingly, it was the directorial debut for Depardieu. I only wish that it were available on DVD, but alas, most of Gerald Depardieu's movies are not available in that format, although this had been previously released on video disc.  My one gripe is that as old as this VHS release is, the price has never been reduced. Why not?",980467200,9,574,4.563106796116505
