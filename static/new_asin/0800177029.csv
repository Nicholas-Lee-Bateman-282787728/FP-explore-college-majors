166420,3,0800177029,"""Wolf"" is a very good movie until near the end.  The story is  more complex, and really has more to do with relationships, office  politics, and the nature of man, than the slow transformation of Jack into  a four-legged beast.
Michelle Pfiefer is excellent as a jaded woman who  has learned not to trust men.  Her relationship with Jack (which I would  normally find hard to believe) works very well.
The movie overall doesn't  dumb itself down with the whole, ""Gee, maybe you are turning into a  werewolf"" question.  They tackle that issue with surpizing humor and  realism.
The only serious flaws in the movie are these: 1) The inevitable  werewolf duel at the end brings the movie down from its  above-doing-cheesy-werewolf schtick, to something you'd expect from Lon  Chaney Jr.  2) The werewolves don't look as real as you would hope for  with the lastest special effects.  You can practically sense the electronic  parts going through their range of motion in one howling wolf  scene.
Still, those flaws are about 10 minutes of this otherwise  excellent film.  If you can forgive it those two items, it's a keeper.
If  you're a serious Michelle Pfeifer fan, this movie should be in your  collection, right next to ""Ladyhawke"" and ""Batman  Returns"".  END",907891200,5,1260,4.85781990521327

166439,5,0800177029,"Will Randall (Jack Nicholson) has made it to the top of his publishing career. With no where to go he is sure to be a victim of the latest merger. He has the support of close friends and loyal clients; however that is not enough for him to see any way out but down or out. Little does he know that he is being helped out.

One night driving on a dark snowy road in Wisconsin he encounters and collides with a wolf. Upon investigation of the situation he is nipped.

Turns out this could be the best/worst that that could happen. Now he finds the physical and mental agility to correct his misfortunes. All he needs is the support of a good woman (Michelle Pfeiffer).

Well played scenario. It is not your typical Wolfy movie. You find your self rooting for Will who I think is Jack Nicholson being himself. One of my favorite scenes is where he is in the mens room and relives himself on a deserving weasel, stating I'm just marking my territory, and you got in the way.",1505865600,,970,4.2896174863387975

166477,5,0800177029,"Oh loved this ""take"" on the whole werewolf movie genre. Jack Nicholson and Michelle Pfeiffer star as the main leads that find themselves in the clutches of the Wolf. Jack finds himself being moved out of the Country with his job, and soon finds out that his younger protg is the one that is going to replace him. But, before that, when coming home one late evening, he accidently hits a wolf on the road. He gets out of the vehicle and decides to see if he can help it in any way. He doesn't and the animal actually bites him on the hand. The DNA is now infecting him without his knowledge until he can't hide it anymore. Gaining certain senses that a normal human would not have, he seems to like it at first, but eventually it takes him over completely.
I found the movie really entertaining, a bit slow at first, but it makes up for it as it progresses along. Jack makes a great werewolf and so does James Spader, who plays the young protg at work. Christopher Plummer plays the boss.
* My only disappointment on this Bluray by Columbia was that there were no special features on it. Not even a theatrical trailer. The Menu is nicely done, however, and I give the movie 5 stars. The Bluray, 3 stars, could have been better itself.
** If you play this on an upscaling Bluray player with an UHD 4K TV, you will get to see this in 2160p.",1485043200,,1337,4.267716535433071

In short, without giving anything away, this is another take on ""The Wolfman"" story, but with modern twists and an updated mythology. It was not the greatest film ever made, but it was a good one, and a film that I would be happy to watch again sometime. Nicholson makes a mean Wolfman.",1470268800,2,525,4.1568627450980395

166518,5,0800177029,"WOLF (1994) is one of my favorite werewolf films, mainly because it substitutes excellent acting and an intelligent plot for over-the-top gore. Jack Nicholson is his usual devilish self here as Will Randall, a fading editor at a publishing house who gets bitten by a wolf as he is driving home one night. A series of events, both professional and domestic, sees Will becoming more aggressive and soon it becomes apparent that Will is actually transforming into a werewolf.

As Will deals with his wolfish tendencies, there is some romance, with the daughter of his boss, Laura (Michelle Pfeiffer). Both Nicholson and Pfeiffer are excellent in their roles, and the chemistry that was evident in their earlier film, THE WITCHES OF EASTWICK, is very much alive here. James Spader and Christopher Plummer also do credible jobs in their supporting roles. The tension, scares, and chills are just right in this slow, simmering supernatural thriller, and make WOLF a stand-out, although sadly underrated werewolf film.",1465603200,2,1011,5.164634146341464

166602,4,0800177029,"The Joker and Catwoman tear up the scenery with James Spader (Sex, Lies, and Videotape), Kate Nelligan (Dracula 79), Richard Jenkins (Six Feet Under/ Flirting with Disaster), David Hyde Peirce (Frasier/ The Perfect Host), Om Puri (City of Joy/ Charlie Wilson's War/ The Ghost and the Darkness), and Christopher Plummer (The Sound of Music, Dreamscape, Star Trek VI, Dracula 2000, A Beautiful Mind, Beginners).  THAT is the reason to see this picture - and because its directed by Mike Nichols (Who's Afraid of Virginia Wolf?, The Graduate, Catch 22, Biloxi Blues) - but if you like Werewolf movies in general, this is yet another classy production with transformation FX by Rick Baker (An American Werewolf in London, Beauty and the Beast, The Wolfman, among many others).

And like a lycanthrope, Wolf itself is a kind of hybrid; part art-film allegory about a mid-life crisis and office politics, part steamy romantic thriller, and partially a straight-up werewolf flick.  The stunt-doubles are kind of obvious at times, and the wire-work and slow-motion photography show off a few minor flaws, but I still find it to be one of the best Werewolf movies out there, and unlike vampires and zombies, there really aren't that many great werewolf pictures to choose from (some great werewolf designs, but not always great werewolf movies).  Wolf makes the top ten or top five pretty effortlessly.  Did I mention a haunting and memorable score by Ennio Morricone (The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly/ The Untouchables)?

A few other werewolf flicks I could mention, The Wolf Man (1941), The Howling (1981), An American Werewolf in London (1981), Silver Bullet (despite a terrible creature design), and the more recent Wolf Man remake (2010).  After that, its the killer B's like Teen Wolf (1985), the Werewolf TV series (1987), Bad Moon (1996), Ginger Snaps (2000), Dog Soldiers (2002), the Underworld (2003) series, and the Twilight (2008) saga (just my opinion - some GREAT werewolves throughout).

166630,4,0800177029,"I like this movie. By today's standards, it has its share of cheesiness, but I still like it. This isn't the normal werewolf movie; no blood and guts everywhere. It's quite slow and methodical and has fresh ideas with where to take the plot. It has good and bad parts; more good than bad, in my opinion.
Let's start with the good.
Jack Nicholson and Michelle Pfeiffer are always great together and this movie is no exception. He plays the mild mannered, down trodden man very well and it is refreshing to see him do that. She is a former delinquent who finds it hard to relate to 'nice guys'. She is also at the height of her beauty here (in 1994) and it's hard to look away when she is on screen.
Jack gets bitten by a wolf on a full moon and immediately starts to transform. They really handled this well. He can hear, smell and see beyond human range and he starts to get really aggressive in his life situations (having been fired and finding out his wife is cheating on him with his protege, who has also stolen his job, he quickly and aggressively dispatches both of them and reinserts himself.) Watch out for the scene where one of his editors asks him how he can see without his glasses and he walks out into the building to see what he can hear. Special effects moved Jack's own ears around like a dog - that, along with Jack's canine acting = great stuff.
Aside from the transformation, there are some standout performances. Christopher Plummer as Michelle's billionaire father is great, as always. James Spader plays the slick, smarmy protege Stuart and he is totally repellent. Kate Nelligan as Jack's cheating wife, also good.
The scene with the strange animal expert Dr who tells Jack exactly what is happening to him is well written and well acted.
So for the good; well acted, some great lines, great sets, atmosphere and costumes and some truly wonderful moments captured on film. Music is fab and sets the mood beautifully.
Now to the bad.
Special effects are quite dated. The animatronics are slow and cumbersome. CGI wasn't mainstream at the time, so they worked with models. Some shots work, most shots do not. You still know you are looking at a model. And now that we have everything in HD, you can clearly see the contact lenses in the actors eyes during close ups.
The wolf make up, while good, looks hard to work with as Jack obviously has trouble with the teeth at times.
The scene where Jack chases a deer through the forest. It probably looked good on paper but did not translate well to the screen. Certain shots do work, but on the whole, it just doesn't. The pretend deer at the end is awful. There are moments when the stuntman running and jumping is not Jack and you can plainly see it, especially with the slow motion. Not only that, but the whole scene ends up being funny when it is not supposed to be.
The ending scene. I get it - it is supposed to be a big wolfy fight. There are moments of genius; when one bites the other and they squeal, but as in the chasing-the-deer scene, there is an overuse of slow motion, presumably to enhance the tension. It just ends up looking a bit clunky and comical when it is supposed to be dramatic.
In short, I don't care about the dated effects and cheese of several scenes. It's still a great movie, even after 20 plus years.",1437523200,6,3302,4.4415156507413505

166680,3,0800177029,"WOLF
Hell of a Good thriller with some Horror mixed in with it
the screenplay is a new Modern version of the Wolfman set in 1993 New York
at the centre of the screenplay is a love story between Will Randall (Jack nicholson) & Laura Alden (Michelle Pffeifer)
Jack Nicholson plays Book editor in chief Will randall who gets bitten by a Wolf in vermont
and throughout the whole 90mins shows symptoms of changing into the WOLF
and then finally fully changes into a Wolf in the last 15mins
Laura Alden who begins an Love relationship with Will randall starts
to reveal symptoms of changes in herself in the last scene of the film where the camera shows closeups of her eyes
and just before the credits start, both Laura & Will meet up as Wolves
Brilliant Acting performances allround in this film
Brilliant Acting by James spader as Will's protege Stewart swinton
and Actress Kate nelligan who plays Charlotte randall, Will's ex wife in the film
the special make up effects are incredible & brilliantly done by none other than Rick baker
the transformation make up effects on Jack nicholson & James spader in
the massive fighting Duel towards the end of the film are amazing, stunning effects very scary
James spader portrays the Wolf very scary & frightening
Rick baker is Definitely one of the big masters of special make up effects

this film is on blu-ray now with a new High Definition 1:85:1 transfer looks much much sharper than the old dvd release
the sound quality has been given a new 5.1 master audio mix which again is a big boost compared
to the old DVD audio
tragically no new special features for this blu-ray version of WOLF
the Late Great Director Mike nichols could've been interviewed for this new blu-ray but sadly he wasn't
and Mike Nichols passed away last year from a Heart attack
also no new retrospective interviews with Jack nicholson, James spader, Michelle Pffeifer or Kate nelligan
this film definitely deserves some new extras for sure
Definitely deserves a new retrospective featurette for this blu-ray release, but tragically there is none
Just a Theatrical trailer
Columbia pictures who owns the rights to this film has not bothered, made the effort to give this film new special treatment
which is an insult really
but at least the picture quality is sharper & clearer so buy it for that reason i guess
the film deserves 5 stars for sure
this blu-ray release maybe 2-3 stars",1421798400,,2403,4.7214285714285715

166830,4,0800177029,"Released during the early summer of 1994, ""Wolf"" is an interesting werewolf tale about a an aging editor-in-chief of a publishing house in New York City -- Will Randall, played by Jack Nicholson. He gets bit by a wolf on the way back from Vermont and starts experiencing strange changes. Meanwhile he loses his high position in the company and is replaced by his ambitious protg, Stewart (James Spader). And problems with his wife (Kate Nelligan) make him ripe for the affections of Laura Alden (Michele Peiffer), who's the daughter of the new owner of the publishing house (Christopher Plummer).

As you can see, ""Wolf"" takes the werewolf legend and places it in modern New York, so don't expect the more Gothic ambiance of werewolf films like ""Wolfman"", ""Curse of the Werewolf"" or ""Red Riding Hood"". Also, don't expect the grotesque transformations of those films and others, like ""An American Werewolf in London"" and ""The Howling"" because ""Wolf"" plays that down. Yet this is still very much a werewolf yarn with the horror elements associated with it.

The film adds a new twist to the werewolf legend: The bite of the wolf affects the person differently, depending on whether they're good or evil. As such, Will Randall's changes are positive for the most part. Even a certain horrific incident isn't actually a bad thing if you reflect on it (the clash in central park). Another character is infected by the curse and the changes are much different.

""Wolf"" works so well because of its emphasis on character. This is not a mindless horror flick; it's a drama with horror touches. Will is a worthy protagonist in which the common man can relate. You can't help but root for him and this shows the difference between ""Wolf"" and most other werewolf flicks: The werewolf is the protagonist. This has been done before, of course -- for example, ""Howling VI: The Freaks"" (which is a quality installment in that non-series) -- ""Wolf"" just ups the ante in this regard.

Michele is effective in her role and she certainly has a striking face, but she never tripped my trigger as far as allurement goes. She's just not curvy enough for my tastes. Still, she's very good in the role.

James Spader's character is sort of puzzling. In some ways he's likable and seems to show some character, but he keeps contradicting this.

Sometimes I couldn't help smirking at some of the werewolf antics, but -- hey -- it's a werewolf film, not ""Terms of Endearment"".

FINAL ANALYSIS: Yes, ""Wolf"" is a worthy addition to the werewolf genre, but it takes the subtle route and focuses on story & characters above the typical horror trappings, which is good or bad depending on what you're in the mood for. As for me, I like it.

The film runs 125 minutes.

166831,5,0800177029,"Love this movie - it's sexy and scary and the whole cast is amazing. Of course Jack Nicholson and James Spader are terrific, but I especially like Michelle Pfieffer in this movie. She was perfectly cast in this part.",1383091200,,216,4.564102564102564
166832,3,0800177029,"The theme of werewolves is often used as a symbolism for human emotion. In Ginger Snaps the metaphor was the 'change' for women, in Wolfen it is man's insufferable tendency to take over things and destroy them while playing God, and here it is a fine balance of the corporate world and how men behave more like animals to stay on top.
Here we have a rather unusual film simply because it's a werewolf drama more than anything else. Yes, that's right...drama.

Will Randall, a man in the publishing world, is driving home late one night when lo and behold, his car strikes down an animal. A conscientious sort, he quickly gets out of his car and goes to make sure the creature is not suffering. Once near, however, it jumps up and gives him a healthy bite, in view of several wolves hidden in the trees surrounding them. Alarmed, freaked out and in pain, Randall quickly saunters back to his car and drives off. Once back at home he tends to the bite but doesn't overdo it, his mind too hectic with trying to climb to the top and stay there at the business.

At work things aren't going so well, though, as a corporate ladder type proves to be cut throat. His wife is suspiciously occupied, and Randall begins to notice strange, subtle things about himself. For one thing, his sense of hearing heightens. He begins to hear office gossip and all the good stuff even more clearly, his sense of smell enables him to discover a colleague has been drinking tequila in the morning, and his predatory instinct causes him to pee on a co-workers foot. Not able to find help at the doctors, he seeks the help of an alternative healer, who informs him that he is turning into a genuine wolf.

Meanwhile, Randall's character meets Laura Alden, the daughter of the corporate big wig who ends up giving Randall the shaft and replacing him with his protge. Cold and offstandish, the two inevitably slowly hit it off, with Alden becoming an aide to Randall in his time of need. Her role is of course a big one, and it's easy to ascertain this just by reading the back cover blurb of the story. A little romance is inevitable, and their relationship certainly proves to be an intriguing one.

Plot wise, enough of the old werewolf legend and crutches remain to make it all too familiar; there's  not much that's overly new here in that regard, except for a few instances, such as once the change has taken place, it's done. In human life Randall was a bit of a weakling; his wife chastised him for allowing himself to be put down, and he was blinded by false friendship from the man who ultimately betrayed him. When bitten, though, his stronger and more predatory instincts kick in, causing him to take control of the reigns and come back to the top of his world once again.

Jack Nicholson is good in whatever he does; this is a slightly different part for the man who isn't a stranger to the odd in film. His personality just works with horror.. He's a bit stiffer than usual roles he picks, and more restrained, but his acting ability allows for this to be carried off. Pfeiffer is truly gorgeous as Laura. Being the rich and misunderstood beautiful girl, she makes a surprisingly sympathetic ally to Jack's character, Randall, in his time of need. James Spader often plays the villainous roles, so here he fits into the part like a silk glove on a well manicured hand. All acting is fine and top notch, as this is a top cast horror film, and of course this adds to the overall experience.

Ennio Morricone's score is nearly Hitchcock like, fitting beautifully with the piece. The direction by Mike Nichols is artful, skillful, and visually pleasing. Being careful to choose films that suit his style (He also did the memorable Graduate), he's an underrated gem. Quick and slow zooms are used often, and the cinematography is an ideal match for this type of film. When a werewolf is shown, the make up job is excellent, portraying a realistic type of werewolf and not some supernaturally overcome creature.

Where this film excels is in its more adult and modern approach to the lycanthrope legend. It's learned that the change is inevitable and that things can be a blessing if you give them a chance and make the best of the situation; that's its survival of the fittest and that additional, needed strength is never a bad thing. The interaction between Pfeiffer and Nicholson's character is intriguing, and their rocky romance is a thing to be reckoned with. This includes Randall's dealings with his boss and forcing his way to the top by making be a hard ass and taking back his dignity. All heart warming stuff that works somehow with the werewolf story.

Flaws are present too, of course. At times the movies pace is arduously slow, moving along at a near boring pace. If you want excitement, you have to look out for it. The fight scenes are minimal, nearly no blood or gore and violence is shown, and if you're a werewolf fan who looks forward to graphic changes, you'd better look elsewhere. Traditional werewolf happenings are amiss, although if you do crave excitement the only scene is a sad one with a deer. How I'd rather see people slaughtered instead! Tension and suspense aren't high, and there is absolutely no scare factor present. What IS interesting is psychological tension between the characters, shown more in verbal exchanges over the usual physical.

Overall it's an intriguing enough film that's fun to watch for Nicholson and Pfeiffer's performance. It's slower and almost not horror at all with its lack of attempted scare and suspense. There's virtually no violence, and if you're watching it's more for mind banter and subtle changes. Still worth a view but hardly a classic in the genre.",1379635200,,5706,4.651785714285714

Now depending how well and how much you take your werewolf mythology, I find 'Wolf' to be a great watch every time I get to see it.  You can never go wrong with this movie's all-star cast and unique storytelling, film-making that reminds me a lot of a classic Stephen King picture.  Jack Nicholson performance is well oiled, and does a fairly good job as the subhuman being. Jack's Eastwick co-star Michelle Pfeiffer rejoins him as a aloof and loveless woman who has manages to open her heart to the character and you can definitely see their Eastwick chemistry is not lost. The only thing that misses the mark slightly about the movie is Laura's  brother.  It is explained a little that he was a borderline schizophrenic and committed suicide.  Question is did this come from he probably being a wolf himself and couldn't handle it?  Or did the Aldens have the cursed wolf trait the whole time?

His protege, Stuart [James Spader] and boss, Raymond Alden [Christopher Plummer] are scheming to end his career. And then he is bitten by a wolf, and everything changes. He becomes charming and self-assured, winning the affections of Alden's daughter, Laura [Michelle Pfeiffer]; he has senses and powers that go beyond any human abilities. But he also has a taste for flesh, and if he is to be free, he will have to run the gauntlet of police and conniving co-workers.

Wolf is unusual in that it presents a monster as the protagonist, without drawbacks or negative traits.

166898,5,0800177029,"In no way a conventional horror movie, nonetheless, it is, alongside the Coppola `Dracula' and the `Branagh' Frankenstein, all brought out within a couple of years of one another in the early nineties, supposedly, part of a revisionist trilogy of that traditional staple horror fare.

Directed by Mike Nichols with a script by Wesley Strick and Jim Harrison (of Legends of the Fall fame), Nicholson is at his brilliant best as the jaded lead editor of a publishing house recently acquired by a billionaire asset stripper played in suitably predatory fashion by the excellent Christopher Plummer.  He gets the `shot in the arm' needed to fight back against the twin evils of rampant capitalism and cuckolding protg Spader, who has more than an eye on Nicholson's wife, Nelligan, and his mentor's job, from an 'obliging' wolf, when travelling back from a business trip through the frozen wilds of a New England winter.  When asked to visit Plummer, ostensibly to be offered a `sideways' move but, in reality, a lower prestige job, he encounters Plummer's slightly wayward daughter, Pfeiffer, who plays her spoilt little rich girl part to perfection and who, initially at any rate, is only too willing to ally herself to Nicholson as a way of spiting her presumably negligent father.

There are, too, turns by stalwart Brit actors, Prunella Scales and Eileen Atkins and Frazier's David Hyde Pierce.  The movie has wit, irony, elegance and a superb and, by turns, lushly romantic and jazzy Ennio Morricone score: all this and some wonderfully amusing moments make for a truly enjoyable experience even if the label `horror' normally turns you off.",1256860800,,1643,5.047970479704797
166899,4,0800177029,"Here's a werewolf movie done with some style and some class. This may be the only werewolf-business world story combination. It features effective villains played by James Spader and Christopher Plummer and the always unpredictable Jack Nicholson.

Nicholson has the lead role, naturally, and is refreshingly low-key, especially for him. I don't believe he ever raised his voice in this movie, acting very subdued throughout.

There isn't as much action as you see in most modern-day horror movies but yet this is such an intense story that you don't lose interest. It's pretty good in the visual department, too, and it doesn't hurt to have Michelle Pfeiffer to ogle.",1244505600,,668,5.1192660550458715
166900,4,0800177029,"Jack Nicholson makes the perfect gentle, mild-mannered protagonist as Will, who becomes slowly transformed after being bitten on a stretch of dark lonely road in the snow after hitting a wolf with his car and then climbing out to investigate in perhaps the creepiest scene in the movie (""A wolf in Vermont? Are you sure?"" everyone keeps asking him). Great star power, atmosphere, and lush interiors in this film, with Pfeiffer as the blue-blood, sarcastic street-smart and estranged daughter of Will's ruthless boss (played beautifully by Christopher Plummer) who replaces Will as senior editor of the publishing house he takes over, with younger, upstart punk Stewart (played by the flawless James Spader who is seemingly BORN to play these kinds of roles) and who we could really refer to as a ""wolf-in-sheep's clothing"" because he has everyone fooled that he is really a nice guy instead of the ruthless backstabbing coward he really is. David Hyde Pierce is also perfectly cast as Will's coworker and buddy who stands by him and whose role could have been expanded so he would have had more screen time, but hey, I'll take what I can get. The story is a refreshing and original modernization of the werewolf tale that has been told a thousand different ways that we have all seen throughout the history of cinema, complete with humor and gore and plot twists that keep it fresh and exciting. They even retained the mystical element of the story as well, but keeping it relevant with this day and age (Will's transformation enables him to deal with these hard situations in a way he was not previously capable of, so it is a joy, in a way, to see him come into his own so the deserving people get what's coming to them) and the effects on the different interpersonal relationships of the characters. The strange, slow-mo ending sequences of the film fall short compared to the first part of the movie (would a climactic werewolf battle include using gardening tools as weapons and attempted rape? um, probably not, but hey, suspension of disbelief is important here), but are unique and interesting enough to keep you guessing as to how the action will end and who will survive. Sit down with a hot cup of tea on a stormy night and enjoy this great re-telling of a classic horror movie story complete with humor, horror, and some great star power, which also includes Prunella Scales (remember Fawlty Towers?), David Jenkins, Kate Nelligan, Eileen Atkins, Ron Rifkin (who has one of the funniest lines in the film), and Allison Janney and David Schwimmer in bit parts - no pun intended!",1239408000,2,2589,4.807174887892376

What struck me after watching this film recently is the possibility that the transformation of man (or woman) into wolf can be viewed as a blessing, a gift.  It certainly is for Nicholson's character Will Randall.  Notice he never maims or kills except in self defense (OK, he DID slaughter the innocent deer, but that is a normal event in the animal kingdom).  What he gets out of it is an escape from the treacherous brutality and betrayal of homosapiens and the freedom to make his life what he wants it to become--we get a clue of this early on from his truthful, but tasteless (and funny) remark at the party about the decline of civilization and the triumph of pop and therapeutic culture.  He has no use for the world humanity has unmade, and werewolfism becomes his ticket out of it.  Added to this is the likely possibility that he'll wind up with his new love as an added bonus.

166912,2,0800177029,"Jack Nicholson as a werewolf.  Now THAT should be some serious entertainment.  Imagine the irascible actor in his typical ""rip you a new one"" form--only this time he's got the physical traits to literally make it happen.  So it was with gleeful anticipation that I recently pulled up a chair to watch WOLF, a film originally released in the Nineties.  And I was so. . .

. . .underwhelmed.  Jack, playing an editor at a publishing house where corporate takeover is, well, taking over, goes through his role with all the intensity and grit of a plow horse going to the barn.  Bitten by a wolf, he begins to experience other-worldly powers, yet for all his energy the filmmakers might as well have given him a sedative.  Love interest Michelle Pfeifer looks good and disinterested at the same time, while ""villain"" James Spader is, I suppose, comic relief.  The ""showdown"" between Jack and James as this film draws to its yawning conclusion is just. . .silly.

Another reviewer has dubbed WOLF a ""thinking man's"" werewolf movie, and while I agree the film elicits thought, for me it pertained to second-guessing thought.  Like why-did-I-just-lose-90-minutes-of-my-life second-guessing?  And, come on:  The jumps and leaps by the assorted werewolves were so lame they reminded me of the lousy special effects from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Six-Million-Dollar-Man/dp/B000MP0XIW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Six Million Dollar Man</a>.

166913,4,0800177029,"For those who had never seen Jack Nicholson play it meek in a movie, this may be as meek as dude gets (and then it only lasts for about half an hour). In WOLF, Nicholson plays middle-aged softie Will Randall, a mild-mannered hubbie locked in a marriage of indifference. Will is also the editor-in-chief of a respected New York publishing agency - that is, until he gets demoted, at which point he assumes this indignant but resigned look. As it turns out, this would only be the first in a series of betrayals, and Will Randall looks to be just another in a long line of easily dismissed victims. Except...

WOLF starts out in a snowy, moonlit scene in which Will Randall, motoring from Vermont to Manhattan, is bitten by a wolf he had accidentally run over. And soon the shocking changes begin to manifest. Will feels strangely rejuvenated, even as he develops extremely heightened senses. Suddenly he's able to eavesdrop from across the atrium, sniff out morning liquor on a co-worker's breath, and hurdle tall walls in slow motion. His newly gained confidence allows him to take charge of his life and even revenge himself on those what done him wrong. And then, one day, a disconcerted Will Randall wakes up, soaked in blood.

Once in a blue full moon, a schlock genre spits out a gem. I happen to think that WOLF is one of the better, smarter entries in werewolf cinema, and I'd even put it up there with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/An-American-Werewolf-in-London/dp/B00005LC4E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">An American Werewolf in London</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Howling-Special-Edition/dp/B00009OWI1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Howling (Special Edition)</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Company-of-Wolves/dp/B00006G8H3/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Company of Wolves</a>. I dig WOLF for the various elements which come correct. For a contemporary film, it wallows in this marvelous gothic atmosphere. There are wicked, unexpected flourishes of humor, and even a smattering of social satire, if one presumes that Will Randall's gradual descent from reserved refinement to uninhibited wolfishness is a metaphor for the predatory, in-the-trenches facet of the New York publishing world.

It's weird seeing Jack Nicholson in an underdog role, but it's very neat seeing his docile, dumped-on character - whose traits of ""taste and individuality"" suddenly become liabilities in his job - gaining a huge pair and constructing such a ruthless yet elegant get-back. Nicholson submits a layered interpretation, delivering a fascinating study of a cultured man's growing horror as he succumbs to his baser instincts. The fascinating bits all have to do with that part of him which revels in this turn to savagery. While Nicholson does get moments to chew up scenery, for a good part we're treated to a restrained performance, although, having said that, there's a whiff of that devilish Jack just underneath most of the scenes. Casting dude as a lycanthrope is a no-brainer; there's always been something feral about Jack. And, when he chooses, who else can apply a more baleful, wolfish glare?

Nicholson is supported by sharp performances by Michelle Pfeiffer (still very much in her babedom, in 1994) as surly heiress and wounded soul Laura Alden, in whom Will Randall finds a kindred spirit, and Christopher Plummer who, as Randall's boss and Laura's father, flaunts just enough equal doses of sophistication, despicability and worldly understanding that he invites this ambivalent, just-on-principles form of dislike. And James Spader rocks. James Spader for a while had cornered the market on those oily backstabbling yuppie parts. This is never more exemplified than in his role of Stewart Swinton, Randall's friend and underling, whose calculated smarm and brand of ""heat and gossip"" contrive to betray Randall in all ways.

Having recently reseen WOLF, I'm again startled that the violence is so low-key. The werewolf scenes are understated, the werewolf make-up not as dynamic or viscerally rendered as, say, that in THE HOWLING or AN AMERICAN WEREWOLF IN LONDON. WOLF instead relies more on suspense and the sense of horror being evoked thru effective use of lighting and score, thru adroit character study and spot-on acting. The disappointing thing is that WOLF, in its climactic scenes, resorts to a typical werewolf fighty fight. And I'm still not quite sure whether I like the ending or not, although the closing shots certainly smack of the darkly poetic. In the final tally, WOLF is overwhelmingly a terrific horror movie, dark and subtle and literate, romantic and wicked funny. So, er, go ahead... take a bite of this (sorry, I groaned too).",1234656000,44,4817,5.539402173913044
166914,4,0800177029,"This simply is one of the most realistic exposs ever on the publishing business. Having worked at several major publishers, I can tell you that thing pretty much work exactly as they appear in the film. When I worked for a house that shall remain unnamed (for fear that one of their editors will enter my garden during a moonlit party and rip out my throat while my guests are mixing martinis in the kitchen) we had several editors and authors contract various forms and variations of lycanthropy. Although to be fair, it is much more common to root out the symptoms early and simply give the person a sick day to go get a few shots, a flea dip, and an exorcism. I can't tell you how many times I had to explain to a growling coworker on the phone that simply howling into the receiver and loudly gnawing a raw deli pork chop was not enough to get them out of a deadline, and that they would be required to produce a doctor and/or shamans note to keep from being docked a day's pay. Between that and the dying mystics calling up wanting us to send around one or more of our editors to bite them so they could live eternally as a wolf I am amazed that any books ever got published. In my department alone we spent over $71,000 on amulets just to keep editors at their desks working - shaking, sweating and grunting incoherently while huge fangs jutted out of their lower jaws - but working. If you are thinking of working with a major publishing house, make sure to see this but be aware that it is a little dated.

Now, if you are a human possessed of a wolf spirit, you should be aware that most publishers daughters are a bit rebellious and willing to date the ""lycanthropically challenged' (as Human Resources makes me call them) but the pairings are so common that there aren't that many good publishers daughters left. Frankly there are so many well-known ""lycanthrope/publisher's relative"" dating websites now that getting into publishing isn't even necessary anymore.

It is true that these days becoming possessed of an animal spirit is an easy way up the corporate publishing ladder. God knows after walking around in the woods for weeks trying to get bitten by even a mildly pissed off toad (with no luck) I finally gave up and just decided to be the best junior editor I could be. And you know what, I'm happier for that. The prowling packs of Wolf-editors might get a lot more play with the ladies at some of the company cocktail parties, but I just stick close to the stables where the chicks that are into horses hang out. Ha ha, those wolf jerks don't even bother hitting on equestrian chicks anymore.

And one more hint, sense of smell being what it is, bring an atomizer full of Cuero and lime to your next board meeting to spritz some of your coworkers with. It will really pay some off as any of their bosses with supernaturally enhanced senses will probably send them home for the day.

If you are a Jack Nicholson fan like myself, you'll want to consider adding this to your library even if you're not a horror fan. Nicholson plays editor Will Randall who gets pushed around by people and even edged out of his high position in the company by a younger man...until he's bitten by a wolf. Suddenly Randall has a wild streak and is fighting to be 'alpha male' again, though not even he is aware at first of how deadly his ambition has grown. This is a really cool spin on the werewolf tales and I like the interaction between Nicholson and Michelle Pfeiffer who plays a rich man's daughter with an attitude. Keep in mind the special effects were not 'up to date' on this one, but it is still worth a watch. Some fans of really gory/bloody horror might be disappointed, but I liked the 'human' focus on how relationships drastically change as a man becomes an animal.

The lighting was so bad in Wolf because, better lighting would have revealed the dime store special effects and prostetics used in the filming.

Jack makes this movie work because, he is convincing as a lycanthrope.

Jack Nicholson, Michelle Pfeiffer, Christopher Plummer, James Spader, Kate Nelligan, and David Hyde Pierce all contribute to the successful execution of this sophisticated and subtle horror film. As an added bonus, those of you who are devotees of the TV series, ""Friends"", should look for David Schwimmer's cameo appearance in the film.

Jack Nicholson plays a middle aged, married, senior book editor for a publishing company. Driving home at night from a business trip in New England, he hits an animal on the road. When he gets out of his car to check on the condition of the animal, he discovers it to be a wolf. What happens next will change the course of his life forever.

When Jack gets back to his office, he is feeling the after effects of his interaction with the wolf. He is also concerned about his job, as his publishing house has been taken over by Christopher Plummer. Jack initially plays his character as a somewhat laid back, nice guy, a good man who doesn't see the knife being plunged into his back by his young, ambition driven underling, played with obsequious perfection by James Spader, until it is too late. Publishing is, indeed, a dog eat dog world.

Betrayed by his underling who has been given his job, Jack finds himself undergoing a subtle, physical metamorphosis. He no longer needs reading glasses, his hearing is extremely acute, and he has a keen, very keen, sense of smell. It is these enhanced senses that lead him to discover that his wife, well played by Kate Nelligan, has shockingly betrayed his love and devotion, causing him to leave her. It is a betrayal that is to have dire consequences for her.

Finding himself more robust and aggressive, literally a new man, Jack goes on the attack and, and with the aid of his loyal underling, played to perfection by David Hyde Pierce, gets his job back. He aggressively asserts himself with Spader and lets him know, in no uncertain terms, who is top dog. There is a memorable scene to this effect. In the process of regaining his life, Jack falls in love with the boss's beautiful daughter, played with gritty charm by Michelle Pfeiffer, and she with him.

Still, Jack finds himself battling his inner demons over his change. The transformation of Jack is subtle, and there is very lttle use of special effects to enhance his metamorphosis. Jack is often able to convey to the viewer what he is undergoing with a flick of the eyebrow, a twitch of the nose, a curl of the lips. It is a wonderful piece of acting and a tribute to the power of suggestion.

Certain events transpire that make Jack fear that his transformation will result in injury to Michelle. She eventually buys into his fear, misinterpreting certain events that take place. What he and she ultimately discover is that they both, in fact, have a great deal to fear, but that their initial fear was misplaced. Look to a great finale.

If you are the type of horror film fan who likes excessive gore, as well as many high tech, special effects, this is not the film for you, as there is very little of that in this film. This is a subtle, multi-layered, symbolic type of horror film that will leave the viewer analyzing what they just saw. It is simply a great werewolf film.",1147219200,3,3363,4.670608108108108

The way the beast is introduced.  Awesome.

I love the story - middle aged man being passed over for promotion after years of loyal service, his wife sneaking around behind his back, office politics and back stabbing...then he gets a gift.

He hits a rather dark and evil wolf on the road in a snow storm and goes out to see if he has killed it, it's parting shot, a bite to his hand and a glare that could kill.

His receding hair line starts to fill in, his eye sight improves so much so he doesn't need to wear his glasses anymore and his sense of smell reaches profound proportions, he smells alcohol on a colleagues breath in his office and the colleague is flabbergasted when he later complains that day to someone on the phone about it, only for him to call him directly after the call to advise otherwise.

He comes into his own, along the gift of the beast comes new confidence and a strength he had found lacking for a long time.

'The worm has turned and is now packin' an uzi' - he tells his secretary.

He deals with his wife, the office sneak and becomes entangled with a confused and sexy Laura Alden - she senses there is something about him and tries to help him as he struggles with what he fears is the beast taking over.

The twist in the plot comes with the entrance of another Wolf and a battle for the lady fair.

Jack triumphs in this rolw and plays the part as if he were a man of thirty, his energy and virility a wonder to watch.  Michelle is sexy as hell as Laura Alden who is falling in love with him despite herself.

Pure magic.

One of my favourite Jack films.",1146700800,2,1725,4.235474006116208
166983,4,0800177029,"Nicholson has done it again.  He seems born to play a wolf, low growl in his throat and leer on his face.  Menacing and tender, ruthless and soft, he is a great screen presence.  This picture moved rather slowly as modern-day pictures go, savoring every detail and allowing the plot to build.  Mrs. Fawlty and Frasier's brother had bit parts.  And James Spader did what he does best - played the ultimate slime with the manners of a choir boy.  (If you haven't checked out ""Boston Legal"", Tuesdays, 9pm, ABC, you are missing two great actors at the top of their game, plus some very fabulous plots)  The office shots where Spader and Nicholson work are of a marvelously restored old building interior.  Would love to know what it was.  Jack was looking bad in the beginning, but progresses to look better as the wolf blood takes hold.  As one newspaper reviewer noted, ""he radiates predatory self-confidence"", something I think he has done in all his roles.  The movie has a very romantic core, as Jack and Michelle come together and try to battle the wolf problem.  At one point, as Nicholson is descending into his wolf persona, he stands before Pheiffer and says to her some of the best stuff I've heard since Mel Gibson in ""Mrs. Soffle"".  Real ""love of the ages"" type stuff.  And the movie is not without humor, always a good thing.",1146182400,2,1336,4.582278481012659

  There are little vignettes that stay in one's mind and draw attention to how well done the acting and storyline is.

Jack Nicholson must have thoroughly enjoyed doing this film because of the dramatic metamorphosis involved.

  It's difficult to find fault with a film that blends horror and humor in an enjoyable and entertaining way.",1140480000,,508,5.097560975609756
166985,4,0800177029,"Thank you, Mike Nichols, for finally making a werewolf movie that doesn't involve terrible creature design, hokey teenage drama, or the silly notion that Lycanthropism has to be ""cured."" Wolf (1994), starring Jack Nicholson and Michelle Pfeiffer, is one of the few werewolf movies of its time that does a good job portraying what it would be like to become a werewolf.

First off...okay the movie starts a little cookie-cutter: Jacky Boy is driving through the woods in Vermont, and hits a huge wolf. The thing appears to be dead, so instead of just continuing on his journey, Jack pulls a Croc Hunter moment that Steve Irwin himself would be proud of: he goes over to the body and, yes, pokes it with a stick.

Well, the seemingly-dead wolf tolerates this for a few minutes before it bites into Jack's hand and runs off into the woods. Jack is mad that he tried a stunt only an Australian could pull off, and gets back in his Volvo and heads down to wherever he lives...New York probably. So anyway, some cool stuff starts to happen to him. He can hear better, see without his glasses, smell better, etc. This is all portrayed in cool ways, like he doesn't notice it himself. For example, his increased sense of smell first shows up when he walks past a co-worker and says ""Why the hell are you drinking scotch this early in the morning?"" The guy is all offended, claiming he didn't, but it turns out he did. Later on, Jack is caught reading without his glasses. He can also hear things like crazy good, and they do a cool sequence of him listening to everything happening in his building (ear-twitching and everything, very easy to accomplish on the screen, of course, but a wonderful touch nonetheless).

So...he starts to wonder what is going on with his senses. He happens to be Editor-in-Cheif for a publishing company or something, so he has them search their database (yes, this was before the internet was really useful to anyone besides Al Gore, who was probably just then getting the idea to steal credit for inventing it). He finds a book on wolf-spirits taking over human bodies, and this leads to that and soon he's got an appointment with an old Hindu dude who wrote the book way back in the day. He goes to meet this guy, they have a talk, Jack gets a necklace.

Oh yeah, Jack's wife is cheating on him with this total douchebag from work who is after his job or something. Jack finds this out cuz he can smell the dude on her jacket (please PLEASE don't be a Monica/Clinton thing! ewww). Anyway, he drives over to the wormy guy's apartment, does a cool leaping-up-the-stairs act, then sees them together and gets totally pissed. Divorces his ho-bag wife, etc. That's really not important except he snaps and Wormy's hand and bites him during the encounter. Uh ohhhh...

Oh yeah, Jack also meets Michelle Pfeiffer, whose dad is a rich jerk. Jack likes her, but the relationship is stunted by the fact that he's constantly lycanthropizing and leaving to hunt the local deer or something.

So yeah, some murders happen, Jack is blamed, there's this whole thing where it turns out Wormy is also a wolfie, they have a cool fight and Jack totally trashes him, but Michelle unloads a whole clip into him...maybe that's what killed him.

Anyway, let's talk about the wolves. Creature effects in this followed the theme of ""less is more"" and, compared to Vampire-Were-Bear from Wes Craven's ""Cursed,"" they were absolutely right. Take one Jack Nicholson. Add some facial hair, fangs/teeth, and contact lenses. Tell Jack to do his werewolf face, and Voila! you've got yourself a perfect wolf-man. Ol Jacky boy does a great performance in this, but more importantly, the guy is already a werewolf as far as his face is concerned. Just give him the right teeth and eyes and you've got it down.

Also, being a werewolf isn't a terrible disease. Jack finished the film as a werewolf. Is that bad? No. It is explained in the movie that the wolf itself is not bad or good, but that the wolf follows the man. If a good man becomes a wolf, then it will be a good wolf. Now this doesn't mean that it will play nice with Bambi (unless playing nice means ripping out the jugular with their jaws), but it does mean that they won't be a man-eater. I liked this aspect--Hollywood all too often thinks that anything supernatural that happens to you is a bad thing and must be ""cured."" That is...before X-Men laid out the smackdown on that type of thinking.

Unlike many films of its time, Wolf doesn't screw it up with too much pop-culture--aside from Jack Nicholson's side-splitting line as he looks at himself in the mirror and says ""Not only am I the president of the Men's Hair Club, I'm also a member!"" Had me laughing for a good minute there.

All in all, not a bad flick, especially if you're in the mood for a 90s semi-horror with a decent story and good presentation.",1139443200,2,4867,4.590333716915995
166986,5,0800177029,"The horror genre and werewolf movies have never been my favorites, but I really loved this movie.  They keep you guessing in this film, and it is full of suspense.  Of course Jack Nicholsen does a great job playing a wolfman, but his best and most compelling scenes are when he's (relatively) normal and sitting around thinking about what he may have done.  Michelle Pfeifer is also excellent, and I liked seeing Ross from Friends (David Schwimmer I think) playing a NY cop, even if it was for just a few moments.  I recommend this movie for Nicholsen fans and those who like horror movies or suspense.",1137196800,,602,4.598130841121495
166987,5,0800177029,"This is one of my personal favorite movies, and I am one of the many who think that it is severly underrated. This is not exactly your conventional horror film, it is way more itelligent, symbolic, and well-written than that. As a matter of fact, I will go so far as to say that it is not a horror film; but an intelligent and entertaining love story/life crisis/dark comedy/satire/drama about corporate power (werewolfism symbolising power).

(On the DVD)
  This is a generally good DVD with both widescreen and fullscreen presentations with good picture (save for some MINOR edge enhancement, some MINOR compression, and NOT-SO-MINOR grain), and VERY good sound (especially the 5.1). BUT (major BUT)
THERE ARE NO EXTRAS!!!! Can we say SPECIAL EDITION, people? Now, my perfect idea for a special edition of this film is as follows:
-2 discs, both DUAL LAYERED
-Widescreen on disc one/Fullscreen on disc two (with newer,less grainy transfers)
-Two Audio commentaries on disc one; one on acting with Jack Nicholson, Michelle Pfiffer, James Spader, and Christopher Plummer; the other is a director's commentary with Mike Nichols
-Two Documentaries, one on disc one about the preproduction and scripting of the film and the acting; the other on disc two about the filmmaking process through the debut
-Behind the scenes photo gallery
-AC-3 encoded DD 5.1 & DTS 5.1 sound
-New interviews with cast and crew
That is what I think would make a perfect special edition for this DVD. How about you?",1135987200,2,1489,4.995967741935484
166988,5,0800177029,"Who ever would have thought director Mike Nichols and stars Jack Nicholson and Michelle Pfeiffer would participate in a werewolf movie?  WOLF is a howling good movie, though, filled with typical werewolf scares and a penetrating script and sharp performances.  Nicholson is perfect as a mealy-mouthed senior editor who is booted by boss Christopher Plummer in favor of his protege, the smarmy James Spader (excellent in his typical style).  At the beginning of the film, in an eerily staged sequence, Jack is bitten by a wolf that he has just hit with his Volvo.  He notices some changes, particularly in his new aggressive behavior, not to mention an enhanced sense of smell and hearing.  Wife Kate Nelligan is having an affair with Spader and this sparks some interesting consequences.  A couple of plot twists occur, one we should have seen coming and the other a little more ambiguous, but sensible anyhow.

WOLF is a classy horror film, and notoriously overlooked, but it's a good one!",1131235200,7,990,4.963636363636364
166989,4,0800177029,"You've got Spader for the young women, Nicholson for the older women and Michelle for the men, how COULD you go wrong! Wolf is an excellently done and acted movie, it's just suspending belief for two hours that wolf bites actually produce wolves that keeps it from being a 5-star flick; though the bathroom scene between Nicholson and Spader is 5-star. I did find myself on the edge of my seat fretting over which wolf would win Michelle. And I really enjoy thinking the man that Michelle's father fired gets the ultimate revenge of making his firer's corrupted daughter even more corrupted. Spader and Nicholson - what more could a woman want!!

166990,3,0800177029,"While on a snowy road, Jack Nicholson (Batman, The Shining) gets bit by a wolf. After that, he soon finds out that he can see without his glasses, he can hear people talking a mile away, he can smell people's scent. So, he finds out that his wife, Kate Nelligan, is having an affair with one of Nicholson's colleauges, played by James Spader (sex, lies and videotape, Dream Lover). Soon, Nicholson falls in love with beautiful Michelle Pfeiffer (Batman Returns, White Oleander) and soo Nicholson becomes interconnected with the full moon where he changes into a furry dog. Good werewolf tale with Jack Nicolson giving it all he has in his performance. Spader also gives a good one as well. Also starring Christopher Plummer (upcoming The New World, National Treasure), Richard Jenkins (Say It Isnt So, Changing Lanes), David Hyde Pierce (Fraiser, Hellboy), Ron Rifkin(Alias, The Negotiator) and look fast for David Schwimmer (Since You've Been Gone, Friends) as a Cop.",1124755200,,968,5.0186335403726705
166991,4,0800177029,"Jack Nicholson plays a werewolf, and he's the most natural werewolf since Boris Karloff.  James Spader plays a weasel and he is equally adept in that role.  Rounding off this impressive ensemble cast (for a werewolf movie) are Christopher Plummer as a man with altogether too much wealth and power, and Michelle Pfeiffer as his lovely daughter.

Fans of werewolf movies may be surprised at the timbre of this particular tale.  The whole story is very surreal and has an everpresent dream-like feel to it.  The special effects of werewolves & transformation are actually pretty scarce.  The film instead mainly focuses on the psychological metamorphosis of man turning into beast.

Perhaps most jolting to viewers of WW movies is the body count.  Or, should I say, the lack thereof.  If you're looking for a WW movie that has scene after scene of poor chaps being mauled, this one may not be for you.

This is a well done film if you're looking for a more cerebral type of WW film than the normal fare.  As I mentioned, the cast is also a higher calibre than normal.  If ever there was a WW story that had a haunting elegance to it, this just might be it.",1102636800,21,1154,4.575609756097561

It has incredible spoilers and great acting, and a very origanal plot- but when it comes down to it I would not recommend watching it a second time. You start asking ""Why is this happening?"" or ""Who scripted this scene?"" It's a lot choppier and makes little sence once you take the time to look at it from a broader point of view. If Jack Nicholson does little massacuring in this film as well, so if your here to look for gore, look elsewhere. There are some creepy (and some disturbing) images, like when he pulls someone elses fingers from his pocket. Sadly fingers have bones in them, and these bonce like... well, rubber (what they're made out of). A good film for Werewolf lovers and fans of the stars, but people looking for meaning should look elsewhere, unless they themselves are going through exactly the same thing.",1097539200,,981,4.64367816091954
166993,5,0800177029,"Jack Nicholson stars in this frighteningly good movie as Will Randall, an editor in chief of a book publishing company.  The opening scene shows Will driving along an isolated strech of snowy road when suddenly a wolf bolts out in front of his car.  The car strikes the wolf, and Will stops to investigate.  The wolf, seemingly dead but very much alive, bites Will on the hand.

Will has been demoted in his company; forced to choose between a less desireable position or no job at all.  Stewart Swinton, played by James Spader, has received Will's old position.

Meanwhile, Will is undergoing physical changes, such as a heightened sense of smell and hearing, all caused by the wolf's bite.  With his heightened sense of smell, he notices a strange smelling cologne on his wife's clothes.  He then discovers that his wife is having an affair with Stewart.

Soon, Will is becoming involved in a new relationship of his own with Laura Alden (Michelle Pfeiffer).  Laura also happens to be the daughter of Raymond Alden, his former boss, played by Christopher Plummer.  As Will and Laura begin to get close, Will begins to show symptoms of being taken over by the spirit of the wolf.  As the moon rises, Will decides to go outside and is soon chasing down deer.  However, the following morning, Will is completely unaware of what happened the night before. He later learns from an old wise man that the wolf grows inside the man until the first full moon, then the wolf consumes him.  Will is given an amulet to wear around his neck to keep the wolf spirits at bay.

The realization that he is turning into a wolf finally begins to sink in, and Will handcuffs himself to a radiator in his hotel room to make sure he doesn't hurt anyone else.  He's already killed a gang member and he's afraid he may harm Laura, who's become very attracted to him.

A police detective comes to Will's room to tell him that his wife has been murdered. Immediately, Will suspects that he did it while under the influence of the wolf.

After arriving back at Laura's house, Will is locked in the barn to keep him from hurting anyone else when the moon comes out.  Laura then goes to the police station to give a statement.  When she arrives at the station, Stewart is there, and mysteriously, he's displaying the same wolf traits as Will.  It seems that somehow during an earlier confrontation, Will must have somehow bit Stewart.  Now Stewart, after losing his newly-gained position back to Will, is out for revenge against him.  Which wolf will win?

This is an excellent movie.  Jack Nicholson has always been one of my favorite actors, and he was the perfect choice for this role.  James Spader and Michelle Pfeiffer are captivating as well.  Notice Michelle's yellow eyes and heightened sense of smell at the end of the movie.  The action is non-stop and the special effects and wolf make-up are first-rate.

The fact that it had only 22 reviews . What is wrong with us ? Very good director , Mike Nichols ( Regarding Henry , Working Girl , Silkwood , The Birdcage , The Graduate ... ). We already know , he is good , very unpredicteble and different ( when he wants to ). Jack Nicholson , as a lead ? It should be not just a horrow film , should be dipper and better . Michelle Pfeiffer ? Oh , Boy ! They really spend MONEY to make it . It have to be good . Was it ? YES ! How fast do we forget good films ? Only 22 reviews ? Even my book get more than that ! Not fear ( for this film ).
 Why would you go to this film and expect a regular horrow flick ? I allways check the director and the actors first . And I do like ( sometimes ) good scary "" staff "". If you want to get really scary ? Go to upper Manhattan at night with Armany siut on . Or go to Sierra Vista at night ( in Las Vegas ), pretending to be a tourist , returning to hotel from a shopping in Boulevard Mall . It will be scary , trust me .
 3. What do I love about this film ?
Exellent selection of every actor for every role . The changes of caracters , unpredictebility of most of them .
 The slight details which tell us so much .
 The exellent acting , that made me forget - they are just actors acting .
 The story itself . The GIFT in some people is a gift ... in some ... Like a nuclear power ... only one way to find out . And I don't want to .
 A dream of something different , just for a moment , please ... can I keep it now ? ... forever , please ?

He wears his betrayal (by his wife and protege (Nelligan and Spader) with just the right element of disbelief and doom.
Mike Nichols had the chance to work with a very talented cast, and special effects (slow mo and the final fight scene - just mediocre) and music notwithstanding, gives us a credible modern horror story/fairy tale.

Very sharply on target and tame for it's  type with good make-up effects that almost influence the viewer to believe  the characters ARE wolves. David Schwimmer has a cameo as a cop.,945907200,2,350,4.629032258064516

7792836,4,0800177029,"It's not as gory as most other werewolf movies, nor does it have a brilliant storyline.  In fact you're thinking as your watching some scenes that they could have done a lot more with them.  Such as Nicholson's human character developing really good hearing and smell in the office place.  The potential for fun there, well it's never reached.  Basically Nicholson plays Will Randall, a guy being used, lied to and betrayed by his boss and his own underlings, and he knows it, but doesn't do anything about it.  Until he hits a wolf with his car and for some reason decides to drag the thing off the road, when it of course bites him.  A robotic wolf from one of those lame rides you go on at a theme park in a boat and drift by, and another watch on as he gets back in the car and drives off.  The boss' daughter Michelle Pfeiffer is really into horses, they don't like Will. She's also into old dudes who are getting hairier and tell her she needs to secure them for their own protection. Her father doesn't like Will.

The ending is very predictable simply because just about every werewolf film does it.  The movie had potential but just never really reaches it and ends up being slow paced for the most part.  3 1/2 stars.",1521158400,,1227,4.365638766519824
