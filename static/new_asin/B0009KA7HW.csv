8324245,4,B0009KA7HW,"Easily the most stylistically original and distinctive film on the competition side of the aisle, Johnny White's ""Temporary Girl"" is a goofy and refreshing comedy that not only asks if there's a Statute of Limitations on dreams, but examines the occasional incompatibility of those dreams with the lives of those who hold them dear.

All this in a film about Jeanette, a fourteen year ""temporary"" worker who spends her days on the job dodging the boss and her annoying co-workers long enough to xerox head shots, sweeten her acting resume on the company computer, make tape dubs in the basement A/V center, etc.  So intent is Jeanette on pushing her struggling performance career, that she's jeopardizing her marriage to a husband who's already realized he's never going to ""make it"" as a rock star.  While hubby has settled into a managerial job at a record store and now desperately wants kids, Jeanette still stubbornly and obsessively chases her big break.

Writer (and co-director) Lisa Kotin was born, it seems, to play the harried and frazzled Jeanette, while the film, with several undercranked scenes and gaudy, in-your-face art direction, is a visual treat from the brilliantly animated opening credits on.

""Temporary Girl"" is definitely on the raw side with a slightly amateurish feel and Jeanette's co-workers are all merely one dimensional caricatures.  But it is good fun and the ironic ""careful what you wish for"" ending was a perfect finale.
