2283727,5,B0009ETCVA,"This is one of the best werewolf movies I have seen in all of my life. The plot is very good. The remake is better than the first one. This movie is really worth watching. It has many Pop up scares which I like and one part with alot of blood. The movie might be rated PG13 which sucks. The same happened to Alien vs Predator and they really mest that up. If they rate the movie a Pg13,not many people may go see the movie and will be one of the very first films rated PG13 by Wes Craven who is known for Terror and not for PG13 films.",1103587200,6,535,3.8727272727272726

2283737,5,B0009ETCVA,What an Awesome Movie with the extended cut version. It shows how they made this movie and it shows a lot more scenes in this movie which they never showed on the On Demand Cable that I have. Christina Ricci is HOT and SEXY in this movie along with the other Women in this Movie. It's a Powerful Scary Movie but it shows how they made this movie with a Guy who played the werewolf and other special effects as well and I'm glad that I have this on DVD!!!:),1470355200,2,456,4.0777777777777775

2283750,1,B0009ETCVA,"This review was inspired by and is dedicated to my friend Lee. I hate you for this, good buddy.
I want to start by saying that I love Wes Craven. I have since I was a child. I know that the immediate image that pops into most people's head is his most prolific creation, he of the razor claws and even sharper tongue, but my love for him spans almost two decades of film. My usual Friday night activity was going to the video store, and renting as many one dollar horror movies as I could, and spending every night of the weekend immersing myself in them. Many of these were Wes Craven films, many I watched multiple times, and many I still watch today. I want that remembered for what I'm about to do.
Jimmy (Jesse Eisenberg) and his sister Ellie (Christina Ricci) are driving home one night when an animal crashes into them, causing then to crash into Becky (Shannon Elizabeth), whose car goes over the embankment, and flips onto it's hood. After Jimmy frees her from the seatbelt, a large animal pulls her out of the window, and pulls all three of them through the woods. Becky dies, but Jimmy and Ellie survive with scratches. The following day, both of them begin to notice changes happening to them, such as increased strength and sexuality, and the fact that his dog won't come near him. Meanwhile, Ellie is dealing with her new boyfriends (Played by Joshua Jackson...That's right. Pacey from Dawson's Creek) past romances, which apparently include every woman in California, and he can't seem to understand why she's upset everytime 37 women show up and start flirting with him, and Jimmy uses his new found strength to join the wrestling team and beat up the bullies at school that show up everytime he starts talking to his crush, and call him many different variations of gay. Once they realize that the werewolf is still chasing them, it turns into the world's biggest cliche to find out who the werewolf is.
I usually try not to list any spoilers, but in this case, I don't care. I don't want you to watch this movie, so I'm going to list all of the things I hate about it.
1. I know a big named cast worked for Wes in Scream, and here he basically tries to repeat that. It doesn't work...at all. For a prime example, try saying Jessie Eisenberg and increased sexuality in the same sentence. See how stupid that sounds? That's how stupid this movie is.
As far as Christina Ricci,  she let's her hair down. Now she's so hot all of the guys she walks by notices her, even though she's walked by them before.
2. When Jimmy decides to join the wrestling team to confront his tormentors, it's much less Teen Wolf, and much more Spider-Man. He's doing professional wrestling moves that no coach would ever allow, and the coaches just stand by with dumb, amazed looks on their faces.
3. When Jimmy dog bites him, he then becomes infected. When the beast finally comes out in the dog, we are treated to the stupidest CGI werewolf/dog hybrid ever. Seriously, a high school student with a laptop could have done a better job.
4. An hour into the movie, we learn that everyone is a werewolf. Jimmy, Ellie, Ellies boyfriend, and Scott Baios publicist, who is the token bitch(Hahaha, my play on words), that nobody likes. You may now be asking yourself why Scott Baio is there, but instead of giving you a long winded answer, I'm just going to say because why not. At this point, what the hell?
5. Remember how stupid the Weredog looked? Turns out the Werewolf looks just as stupid. Even better is the transformation, which is almost painful to watch. It would seem they used the special effects budget on securing Scott Baio.
6. Once Jimmy wins the wresting match, the main bully shows up at his house, and admits that he is secretly gay, and Jimmy is the only one that ever figured it out. After a super awkward attempted kiss, they are best friends. Not only is this lazy storytelling, I would think it would he offensive to gay people. The entire first half of the movie is filled with anti-gay slurs, but it's cool, it's only to disguise someone's embarrassment about being gay.
7. It turns out that Ellies boyfriend has been a werewolf since birth, but he gave the curse to the publicist after a night of unprotected sex. She attacked Ellie, and by random chance Jimmy, because he rejected her, and started dating Ellie. She actually says during the fight scene ""If I can't have him, neither can you"". So the whole movie boils down to a jealous female who didn't get what she wanted, so she's acting out.
I could keep going, but I don't even care anymore.
Scare Factor 1/10 This movie is billed as a horror comedy, but it's neither scary nor funny. It fails on every level at every thing that it attempts to do. It is bland and pointless, and there is no redeeming quality to it.
Gore 1/10 Yep...a Werewolf movie with a minimal amount of blood. Like a scrapped knee level of blood. No blood.
Recommended 1/10 I hate this movie. It's insulting, moronic, and is complete garbage. The ending features Ellies boyfriend, who for the entire movie has just wanted to love her, suddenly changing pace, and deciding he should kill her brother. This is so they have a reason to team up, and kill him, the main Werewolf, and break the curse, and secure a happy fairy tale ending. Then Jimmys crush approaches with his now cured dog, and his ex bully/new best friend, and they walk off into the sunset. I have literally had better nightmares. There are children's movies with more depth than this. It's not even good to watch with a group of friends, so you can all make fun of it. This movie is to film as cancer is to awesome. That doesn't even make sense, and neither does this ridiculous excuse of a movie.
As a side note, and I might be over reacting, but I would like to address a personal insult from movies of this nature. I know beautiful people help sell movies, and Hollywood has certain expectations, but it is insulting to load a horror movie with actors that that have no business being in it. Dedicated horror fans, statistically speaking,  are outsiders, and not the Uber popular kids. We are the ones sitting in the stairwells reading during lunch, because we're too weird to sit with any of the social groups. By not only loading a ""horror"" movie with nothing but people that wouldn't have talked to us in high school, but having everyone in the film playing some kind of horror genius,  ( Examples include Ellies boyfriend owning a all horror themed nightclub, Jimmys school library having a vast assortment on books regarding lycanthropy,  and Jimmy himself having a massive amount of horror comics and paraphernalia), it shows absolutely zero respect for the people that have dedicated their lives to loving all things horror. I might be the only one that feels this way, but it is a slap in the face.
Furthermore,  you cannot just take any actor, and toss them in a horror film, and expect good results. It requires talents that other genres of movie do not, just as those genres require talents that you might not find in a horror icon.
You don't put Kane Hodder in a romantic period piece. It would be absurd.
Jeffrey Combs in a romantic comedy. Nope, it would never happen.
Sid Haig in a moving drama about over coming adversity due to racial profiling. Not a chance...
That's because these guys are horror actors, and what they do is very unique and part of the charm of the entire genre.
Please stop ruining movies by throwing A-list actors in there that don't appreciate horror, and just see it as another role. They might not care, but we, the fans, do.",1457395200,,7576,4.547252747252747

Its a decent movie as far as scares go. The plot line is a little shaky. I find myself rooting for the little brother alot. The special effects were pretty solid but could have been a little smoother. The werewolf effects came off rough around the edges.",1445472000,,564,4.380952380952381

2283797,1,B0009ETCVA,"There's no reason why Cursed couldn't have been a good movie, especially considering some of the big name talent on hand. The film certainly looks good, and if nothing else it's a slick, visually appealing movie. Once you get past the production values, though, Cursed falls apart. The script tries way too hard to be ""hip"" in the Scream fashion, but even if you assume that's a valid aspiration, it fails miserably. There's a lot of really silly comic relief, and if you rent this movie looking for a few good scares, forget it, they aren't here. The only real bright spot in the production is Christina Ricci, who delivers by far the best performance and tries to make her character work as something other than a joke--if only a few of her co-stars had taken a similar approach. This is more of a teen comedy of manners than a werewolf film, so if the latter is what you want, look elsewhere.",1438128000,,895,4.530864197530864

2283809,3,B0009ETCVA,"""Cursed"" has a pretty lousy reputation, and while I won't say that some of it isn't earned, it's much better than you might expect. Brining together Kevin Williamson and Wes Craven, the same team up behind ""Scream"", ""Cursed"" tries to do with the werewolf movie what ""Scream"" did with the slasher film.

""Cursed"" starts out with a brother and sister arguing as they cruise along Mulholland Drive in the hills above Los Angeles. Jake is upset with his big sister Ellie for leaving him stranded on Sunset strip. Jake is a bit nerdy, and was being pushed around by some bullies, while Ellie is trying to piece together her relationship with a wealthy nightclub owner who is a bit of a playboy. As they argue they hit an animal, which causes their car to crash into another car, knocking it off the edge of the road and down a hill. Ellie and Jake run to help the girl they've knocked off the road, and all the while Ellie continues to hear something stalking around in the woods, circling them. Jake manages to free the girl they've hit, when she is grabbed by a large wolf and dragged through the woods. Jake and Ellie both try to help her and manager to get bitten and scratched by the wolf in the process.

If you are going in looking for serious scares, you most likely will hate this film. Like most of Kevin Williamson's scripts, this movie is packed with pop culture references, and in-jokes and it's fun. Craven always has a good eye for horror, and he does a fine job shooting this film. The cast is good, packed with a who's who of stars right off the CW Network. The F/X are a decent mix of practical and CGI, so while the werewolf looks better than the full CGI ""American Werewolf in Paris"", they still can't top what you saw two decades earlier in ""American Werewolf in London"".

I think the biggest drawback to ""Cursed"" is the overly-long, overly-complicated finale. Williamson has a penchant for letting his ""killers"" over-explain their motivations in the closing scenes, and ""Cursed"" has one of the most drawn out finales of all of his films. The ending just drags, and you're left feeling pretty bored during the climax, and all excitement gets lost.

Fun movie, worth a watch, but not sure if I would re-visit.",1431648000,,2224,4.5525

It's weird Portia DR is listed as starring.  The other characters are more well known as well as more talented.  Given the movie's slight 'gay closet-jock sub-story line', which adds some true to life humor, it's a decent Wes Craven film.",1429833600,2,407,4.855072463768116

After an auto accident Christina Ricci  and Jesse Eisenberg find themselves  cursed and hunting Hollywood for a werewolf in hopes of a cure. Craven's werewolves have picked up the vampire's animal magnetism somehow, now even stray dogs are not immune. These new werewolf skills include some serious elevator stalking talent, super high school wrestling talent and monster research powers. The film suffers from recasts and rewrites caused by schedule conflicts. Ultimately the story is as cheesy and uninspired as the look of the transformed lycanthrope itself. But Christina and JesseCo-stars include Heroes' Milo Ventimiglia Fringe's baby faced Dr Bishop a.k.a. Joshua Jackson. Hollywood celebs are represented by self-portrayal walk-ons by lance Bass, Scott Baio and Craig Kilborn (who bumps Baio for Carrot Top no less).",1413072000,,961,5.575342465753424

2283948,4,B0009ETCVA,"i recently watched cursed, and i must say it left me wondering: why does this movie engender so much hate? is it because of all the press preceding its' release, that production was troubled? is it more of the boring backlash that old horror masters seem to get because they make movies differently, now that they are forty years older? or was it simply fatigue at yet another dimension flick, and its' slick portrayal of self-aware characters, who are in on the joke? whatever it was, i really liked this movie, and it showed me that wes craven and kevin williamson's partnership extends beyond scream.

basically, the story concerns a brother and sister played by the ever awesome christina ricci and jesse eisenberg, who are bitten by a werewolf. what ensues, of course, is the two sibs experiencing the strange precursors to going full wolfy, like smelling blood, waking up nekid in the yard, sudden animosity from the family dog, and a pentagram suddenly being on their palms. but what's more interesting is the classic williamson whodonnit that pervades this movie. who is the werewolf? where did the curse begin? we are given many possibilities. additionally, cursed takes one tired and true trope of movies involving outcasts and turns it upside down. very nice. it also makes a few interesting contributions to werewolf mythology.

the cast is fully entertaining, from the two leads, to supporters judy greer, who is, of course, bitchilly hilarious, the mysterious and likeable joshua jackson of fringe fame, and bit supporters like portia di rossi in the requisite fortune teller role, and horror fave shannon elizabeth as an early victim. ricci and eisenberg work well together, one ready to accept what is happening to them, the other in denial. this conveniently mirrors their family lives, so, you just know that the catharsis of turning into slobbering beasties will bring them closer together.

craven directs this movie with great smoothness. it's amazing to think he started with last house on the left, because his camera has really evolved into something graceful, fluid and, more surprisingly, beautiful. i think craven deserves more recognition for how gorgeously he can construct a shot, and, as he has gotten older, i think this has become one of his hallmark. cursed isn't meant to be a grueling exercise in terror; craven is fully aware that he is directing light entertainment, and he succeeds admirably. i wasn't bored or uninterested for a frame of this movie. it fits neatly into a ten-year horror block of dimension films, including the scream movies, the faculty, h20, teaching ms. Tingle, phantoms and others, that I really enjoy.

and a word on the visual effects: rick baker is obviously the master of many things, not the least of which are werewolves and apes. further, he has effectively (see the wolf man) blended practical make-ups with cgi, which is how it should be done, in my opinion. cursed provides uneven results. the werewolves themselves look great, very american werewolf in london-y. the transformations are somewhere in the middle, the practical parts looking great, the cgi stuff looking a little cartoony. the werewolf movements were also a little hokey when done by computer, but gorgeous in close-ups. overall the effects do more to help than harm this entertaining flick. additionally, homages abound, from wax figures of freddy kreuger to lon chaney's wolf man. The silver tipped cane that was his undoing in 1941 even makes an appearance.

cursed is fully engaging entertainment that proves the werewolf is still a viable, entertaining, and sympathetic movie monster. as with my soul to take and scream 4, don't believe the hate: craven still rocks. see this one for yourself.",1402617600,2,3735,5.047001620745543

2283981,3,B0009ETCVA,"A fateful accident in the woods leaves a brother and sister cursed by the beast that bit them as they return home with extraordinary new powers! CURSED is SCREAM writer Kevin Williamson's answer to THE WOLF MAN, taking another all-star cast of popular teen idols and mashing them together with countless genre references that many of them will be too young to understand. Williamson does not strike gold twice in this case, as the writing here is not nearly as clever or as pointed as his previous successes, dropping CURSED down closer to a SCREAM 2 or 3. You couldn't ask for a more unnatural pair in bringing together Christina Ricci and THE SOCIAL NETWORK's Jesse Eisenberg, while things are made all the more awkward with the insertion of Joshua Jackson as the love interest, who seems incredibly unenthusiastic about the role. Still, there is a certain camp quality about the picture that lends more entertainment than it truly deserves. Shannon Elizabeth is ripped in half, classic monster moments are played out in modern day LA, and there is plenty of Scott Baiosploitation. Some twenty-four years after reshaping special effects world with AN AMERICAN WEREWOLF IN LONDON, Rick Baker returns to create a new wolf for the 2000's, but the new costume paired with the computerized transformation sequence comes off as being entirely unremarkable. Just how much of the film suffered from the complications in production, we may never know, but at least CURSED is good for a few cheap laughs.

2283984,4,B0009ETCVA,"Put basically, if Cruel Intentions (1999) was a werewolf movie...one of Wes Craven's finer bubble gum horror outings.  There's a whole lotta' dumb in this flick, but it's all in good fun.

Jenny (Mya) and Becky (Shannon Elizabeth;) visit a sexy fortune teller (Portia de Rossi) who divines a rather unfortunate palm reading for these girls.  They're in ""danger.""  Way to rip on the classics!

Straight out of the I Know What You Did Last Summer playbook, Ellie (Christina Ricci) and Jimmy (Jesse Eisenberg) lose control of their car after hitting a ""dog or something"" and accidently run a car off the road and down a cliff in the woods during a full moon--it's always a full moon when people die isn't it?  Poor Shannon Elizabeth.  Before she had time to exchange insurance information she was dragged to her death by a big bad wolf just like that surprisingly cute gypsy said.

Scratched during the encounter, Eisenberg goes all modern day Teen Wolf and does some Google research on werewolves to learn more about his possible fate.  When he wakes up naked on the front lawn the next morning, we know it's official.  We have ourselves an awkward teen werewolf.  Ricci, also scathed from the event, now has violent dreams and heightened senses.  That's two new to the pack.

Ricci works with Kyle (Michael Rosenbaum) and a very catty Joanie (Judy Greer).  Also, Ricci's dating Jake (Joshua Jackson).  It's all very relationship-y; people need space, have unrealistic crushes, and consult oracles about boyfriend commitment issues.  Despite that, and much more to my delight, gorgeous women get slaughtered in this flick.

You cannot escape the Cruel Intentions vibe.  You have the parentless brother and sister werewolves which, adding to the werewolf mythos, have a preternatural sexual allure.  Love interests, flirting and cattiness abound.  Joshua Jackson is in it.  And, like its classic Wolfman counterpart, we stick to tradition with the silver handled cane, the mark of the beast, pentacles, more silver, meat cravings, and unnerved dogs.  They cover the classic bases.  There's even a scene where they're discussing werewolves in front of a wax werewolf representing the classic Wolfman.

The gore is nice.  But what stands out is the ""fun"" factor of this flick.  We see Shannon Elizabeth's upper half crawl away from her lower half, gaping neck wounds, and a sloppy decapitation.  Like Freddy, our werewolf does the scratchy claw thing to drum up fear.  We even have a ""werewolf dog"" and a wall-crawling teen with new powers and a new edgy haircut he shows off for the girls like Tobey MacGuire.  This all ends in a cheesy bro-hug from his high school nemesis and then he gets the girl.  Pretty much a happy ending.

EFFECTS:  Van Helsing (2004) came out at about the same time and has a notably superior werewolf of entirely CGI.  In Cursed they were going for the same overall look (about 7' and 350+ lbs-ish) and speed, but used a guy in a suit most of the time.  Except, of course, for the transformations scene which were hardly cool, interesting or acceptable.  Didn't matter much, though.  Actresses, mid-catfight and smack-talking, hardly needs a top-notch transformation for me to be happy with their scenes.

In defense of Shannon Elizabeth:  Why doesn't this beautiful, capable actress get more work?  You can tell me that she was annoying in Cursed but hey, reality check, she was playing a twentysomething who was willing to consult a carnival fortune teller for relationship advice.  I'm pretty sure any such girl would be ""annoying.""  So, it sounds to me like she did her job perfectly.  Oh, she didn't ""wow"" you?  Well just what about that role was suggestive that she would?

Apparently film maker Wes Craven wasn't pleased with this outing either, but that is another story. Nothing new here, though some OK scenes and decent camera work occasionally shine, (such as the opening scenes). Overall I found it rather boring and not scary. Though not a total loss, this was largely an example of missed opportunities, further marred by a couple of lame sub-plots aimed at the young-uns.

2284001,3,B0009ETCVA,"I'd say rent this film if you are a fan of the horror genre. The starting sequences are actually pretty solid, and there are some genuine thrills in the car crash sequence and an elaborate stalking scene in a parking garage. Too bad the movie derails itself soon after, but you do get a sense at some point there was an actual movie in here somewhere. And it is in these scenes we see the real Wes Craven emerge as a horror director, even if it is a fleeting glimpse. Several scenes that remain from the original script/shoot include a rather witty resolve to the stereotypical ""geek vs. jock"" subplot. You may see it coming, but it's still a lot of fun to see a glimpse of Kevin Williamson actually writing something that feels genuine. It's not all bad, and considering its checkered history Cursed could have been worse than it is. It's still not a great movie by any stretch of the imagination, and the glimpses of the good makes it all the more frustrating.

Cursed, unfortunately, lives up to its title  'cursed'. It's not scary, makes little sense, and plays fast and loose with the conventions of the traditional werewolf movie. It feels like a rush job that few of the participants seemed to care for. The DVD is well produced, but it misses the boat as to what it could have offered. Too bad studios are so sensitive about what they include in official releases, because I would have killed to have seen the footage that was shot before the entire project went to rewrite hell. How about a commentary with Wes Craven and Kevin Williamson telling us what they really intended to do with the project? Dimension should have let us see and hear what really happened to make Cursed such a letdown.

2284002,4,B0009ETCVA,"""Cursed"" stars Portia de Rossi, Mya, Shannon Elizabeth, Kristina Anapau, Christina Ricci, Joshua Jackson, Jesse Eisenberg, and a dog named Solar (Solar plays the part of Zipper in the film).  The story is about a young adult gal who is raising her not all that much younger brother since their parents died.  The young adult gal and her brother get in a car accident involving an animal, and another vehicle - which the latter of, careens down an embankment.  The gal and brother check it out, and although still alive in the upside down car, the other driver gets dragged off and killed by a werewolf.  The young adult gal and brother try to save the other driver, and get injured by the werewolf, thereby becoming cursed themselves.  Kind of a fun story, very mild FX for the gore IMHO, the scary movie requirements of stupid stuff happening and idiotic moves by the characters are all here, and with a twist toward the end of the film, when things heat up the FX for werewolf transformation are pretty good.  There's no nudity (that counts) in this PG-13 rated film (even though it says unrated on the cover art), and yet there is some violence and gore more than what I figured would be in a PG-13 film; I've watched several other higher R-rated films with less of both - which those should have been just PG.  Also known as ""La Marca de la Bestia,"" ""Amaldicoados,"" ""Malefice,"" ""Verflucht,"" and ""Wes Craven's Cursed.""  Filmed in Los Angeles, California at Hollywood Center Studios, released in 2005, this film runs about 97 minutes.  Watch for the comedy relief toward the end where the werewolf gives Christina Ricci the middle finger.  This film has an ever so slightly different ending from what you probably saw on late night TV.  The cussing fits in this film, and as this film points out, a werewolf has a naturally sexy allure (which I'm guessing makes me a werewolf by that distinction).  The movie would have been better with some female nudity.  A good horror film is rated R, for female nudity, violence, gore, and filthy language.  This film barely delivers at the PG-13 level for violence or gore, and there isn't any female nudity.  Spoiler alert - there is a beheading in this film.",1318723200,,2201,4.66580310880829

And there is quite a bit of humor in it as well, especially Jessie Eisenbergs character. It has terror, romance, everyday life situations of the  usual teenage school experiance. The special effects were also great as well! ""Joshua Jackson played the role of the a boyfriend your mothers always tried to warn you ladies to steer clear of."" A fun movie that will keep your interest as well as give you some laughs along the way as well.

The story sounds asinine, but the plot really works thanks to a strong script by horror genius Kevin Williamson, and the fantastic direction of Wes Craven. The actors are also exceptional, featuring performances by Christina Ricci, Joshua Jackson, and Shannon Elizabeth. ""Cursed"" was a big hit when released to theatres in 2005. In this special edition DVD two extra minutes were added to the final cut that features some graphic violence deemed too extreme for movie audiences.

So, I finally got hold of a copy and watched it last night, figuring that I was about to witness a total catastrophe. Well, perhaps it was my extremely low expectations, but I actually enjoyed it! While it's certainly no GINGER SNAPS or AN AMERICAN WEREWOLF IN LONDON, CURSED isn't the disastrous failure I'd heard about. Christina Ricci (Addams Family 1 and 2, Sleepy Hollow, Monster, The Gathering) plays her lead role w/ ease and humour. She is a gothic chick without even having to work at it! Her features alone make her the next Barbara Steel! CURSED also has a decent plot and pacing. The CGI transformation effects are passable, but still make me mourn for the days of latex! The cast, apart from Ms. Ricci, is typical Craven / Williamson, mostly young, shallow, yet beautiful people. CURSED also has far fewer in-jokes and less self-aware humour than the SCREAM films. So, it's a fairly straightforward werewolf movie. If you love Christina Ricci, werewolves, or Wes Craven, then CURSED should give you a boost...",1259193600,22,1119,4.803108808290156
2284023,2,B0009ETCVA,"Cursed is a disappointing, formulaic horror movie (complete with ample references to classic horror films that did not use this formula) that highlights once again that Wes Craven somewhere in the 90s ushered any real talent he had out the door.

Looking at the production history should be the first clue to what to expect out of this film. A handful of actors dropped out, after already having shot scenes, requiring on the fly re-writes and re-shoots causing the movie to be delayed at least a year. Sets for a finale in a wax musuem get cannibalised into a club...with wax musuem exhibits. Go figure.

But, you may argue, this can be balanced out by looking at the remaining cast, most of whom are stellar actors and actresses. Except that you can stuff whoever you want into your story, if it's bad it stays bad.

The story follows Elli (Christina Ricci) and her brother Jimmy (Jesse Eisenberg) who through a horrendous car accident down a hill that follows in an animal attack, as they realise they have become afflicted with the curse of the werewolf and their efforts to find the person who bite them so they can be cured by killing them. Which means, of course, that one of the many random characters all over the movie is going to be a werewolf, and at least one will be a red herring, and by the time it all unravels the viewer will have just watched a terrible film.

The story bumbles through Jimmy trying to convince Elli that they are indeed werewolves while both of them experience changes to themselves while still trying to continue with their lives. (In fact, they're so determined to continue with their lives that the morning after the car accident where they witnessed a girl mutilated by an animal, Jimmy is telling Elli of the werewolf lore and she tells him claiming to be a werewolf is no excuse to get out of school. Forget the fact that they just saw someone die horribly a few hours ago, the two don't even really give her death a second thought.) As such, we see too much of their lives interspersed with what's actually some pretty good werewolf scenes, but not a lot of them. Which is sad because these werewolves were VERY good looking, and their scenes were the only ones with any kind of reasonable pacing.

So it slowly, slowly builds to its predictable end, a werewolf crawls on the ceiling for some reason, and all that's missing out of the generic horror formula is a surprise ""IT'S NOT OVER!"" ending.

I guess they weren't counting on a sequel to this one.",1256601600,,2496,4.560267857142857

Jimmy is still in high school and a frequent target for a jock (Milo Ventimiglia)'s homophobic slurs. Ellie is an intern for the Craig Kilborn show (this film isn't dated at all). One night while driving home on Mulholland Drive they get into a car accident and in the ensuing chaos both get bitten by a large animal. Jimmy believes it to be a werewolf but both Ellie and the cops think it's his overactive imagination. The next morning when Jimmy wakes up naked in the bushes and Ellie develops a craving for blood she begins to rethink her brothers' claim. After doing some investigating she learns that her and Jimmy have been cursed by the mark of the beast and that the only way to reverse it is to kill the werewolf who gave it to them. The two siblings spend the remainder of the film trying to figure out which one of the colorful characters populating their lives is actually a werewolf. Their search includes Ellie's womanizing boyfriend (Joshua Jackson), a psycho publicist (Judy Greer), a goofy gypsy (Portia DeRossi) and Scott Baio as himself. The film is fun in a campy sort of way but that isn't enough to sustain it. This is both confusing and disappointing since the creators, Wes Craven and Kevin Williamson, are the two men responsible for re-inventing the teen horror genre with 'Scream'. The script has none of Williamson's clever satire or Craven's skill at orchestrating suspenseful tension. Instead they rely on shots of their KNB created werewolf baring it's sharp teeth and plenty of gushing blood to provide the scares. There are some fun moments in the performances and what little satire there is is appreciated, but 'Cursed' is a disappointing effort from both men.",1253750400,3,1800,4.809677419354839

The seqeunce are very violent as typocial of monster movie starting around the release time of p-13 rate horror movies such as king cobra with higher fatalites than had been seen in previous films.

2284060,3,B0009ETCVA,"Cursed in some ways does not even attempt to be a serious Werewolf Movie so I can not grade it harshly for being weakly written.  Cursed has a Movie of the Week feel to it.  Curse is bubble gum for the eyes fare for those like me who are old enough to Remember weak lame but always good for a laugh old Network Movies of the week.  The special effects are oh so average, the script is oh so predictable.  The good part about this movie is it is done in a way that is oh so funny.  While Cursed does try to take itself seriously on the surface it is almost a spoof on werewolf movies in general.

If you want some really good werewolf fare buy. Underworld the first installment.  All the werewolves went lame in Underworld 2 which is not worth buying in my humble opinion. An extremely good werewolf movie is also, Wolf by Jack Nicholson, Michelle Pfeiffer, James Spader, and Kate Nelligan.  Wolf movie rocked my werewolf flick world but good.  I collect Werewolf movies and this one while weak in many ways is at least worthy of its place in my collection.  Dog Soldiers is another great werewolf DVD.

If you buy this movie expecting grearness you will be disappointed.  I havew lived long enough to know few studios \ producers \ directors do the background work needed to pull off a really great werewolf movie.  To do a great werewolf movie you have to immerse yourself in the world of Lycantrophy and be willing to spend time feretting out the insightful details that make for interesting plot points.  Good tight writing and interestingly well developed characters in some kind of conflict round out the mix in a well made werewolf movie.  Most folks that truy love werewolf movies are real lycantrophiles and we don't warm to ready made werewolf junk thrown on film. Those who love a truely good werewolf movie would rate Cursed barely 1 star.  Most Lycan lovers give Cursed 2 stars only because they were feeling unusually kind for a moment.

Cursed covers well worn old ground of werewolf fare and breaks no new ground at all.  Cursed is good enough to be watched once easily.  Best to reserve cursed for those times when an unruly group of your feral brain cells want to watch a movie while the rest of you is sleep or thinking of something worthwhile.",1176681600,2,2262,4.486552567237164

Basically, it is about a young woman and her younger brother who got ""infected"" and became a werewolf.  The younger brother, who is in high school, not only must deal with school bullies, but also with his new abilities as a werewolf.  Meanwhile, there is another werewolf on the loose, causing havoc throughout the city.  It's now up to the brother and sister to find out the identity of this other werewolf and stop him.

This is probably a good teenage date movie though.  I can see where it would appeal to the high school age group.",1166313600,,775,4.688888888888889
2284062,2,B0009ETCVA,"""Cursed"" tried to double-dip its way into the horror genre.  First, it used Kevin Williamson (""Scream"") as the writer in order to bring in some funny yet still reasonably scary plotlines.  Secondly, master horror director, Wes Craven, was brought on to guide this shipwreck along.  With both of those pieces in place, you'd think that this flick would have been pretty good.  Instead, ""Cursed"" managed to be neither funny NOR scary.

The story is textbook.  Siblings that don't seem to get along very well are bitten by a werewolf.  One sibling believes his fate while the other denies everything.  In the end, the one werewolf who started all of the chaos has to be destroyed in order to lift the curse.  Dull, dull, dull.

The cast was pretty atrocious.  First of all, Christina Ricci is usually a very good actress in everything she does.  In ""Cursed,"" she's nothing more than an annoying, henpecking older sister to her brother (Jesse Eisenberg), who is the only redeeming part of this film.  He has a very Frank Whaley-like appeal to him.  (For those who don't know, Whaley is the nerdy dude in ""Career Opportunities.""  He has also starred in a number of other films, most notably ""Swimming With Sharks.""  Portia de Rossi is wasted as a two-bit gypsy ripped directly from the original ""Wolf Man.""  Michael Rosenbaum is sufficient as a co-worker of Ricci's, though he is capable of so much more.  Pacey, I mean Joshua Jackson, portrays Ricci's ""sort of"" love interest.  Essentially, though, he plays Pacey playing Pacey trying to be Pacey.  Shannon Elizabeth and Mya (why?) play short-lived werewolf food.  Scott Baio (no, really, I said Scott Baio) plays himself on the Craig Kilborn show and, ironically, Craig Kilborn plays himself as well.  If these two were brought on for star power, then the casting director must have thought the producers wanted a faded star and a third-rate late-night host.

To sum up, ""Cursed"" is bad.  It's not funny, not scary, just bad.  Only the special effects are reasonably good, but if you've seen ""Van Helsing,"" then you've seen what a CGI werewolf looks like already.

While Cursed had some weak spots, overall it was fun to watch. The acting wasn't bad, and there was nothing fancy with the script, plot, music, special effects or visuals, but overall it was a satisfying package.

Jesse Eisenberg carries the film as Jimmy, and Portia de Rossi does a good job as Jimmy's sister, Zela. Zela, at times, had weak spots but overall held her performance together without going off into over-acting land. There were some mediocre actors in the film, and some that just looked flat or like they had no clue what was going on.

One of the annoying aspects of the film for me was the use of Scott Baio as Scott Baio, and Craig Kilborn as Craig Kilborn. I dislike being pulled out of a movie and back to reality, and Cursed did that to me numerous times by using so many real people. Zela was employed by the Craig Kilborn show, and we see a ton of scenes with her at the office. It was a little over the top.

Cursed is the type of film that generally won't leave people passionate one way or the other. It is entertaining, fun, and somewhat immersive, but not something that most people will remember, talk about, or rush out to buy.

See it and enjoy it for what it is: a fun 2 hour diversion in the world of werewolves.

A note on the ""unrated"" version: there was no point to this label. The unrated version contains very little gore at all, as the movie really isn't violent, and no nudity or anything else excessive. For Cursed, the unrated tag is more of a marketing ploy than anything. Get the unrated version, but don't expect much.

2284087,4,B0009ETCVA,"Didn't someone say that the original version, the one that featured Omar Epps and James Brolin and Mandy Moore, the script was  much more heavily what passes nowadays for ""postmodern"" (i.e., a postmodernity limited to self-referentiality)?  If I remember right, the original version wound up with the beast figure whom everyone was trying to identify--the one who was making everyone into a werewolf--was none other than Scott Baio.  When you see the movie today, all Miramaxed out, Baio's brief appearance is a matter for head scratching, but makes sense it it was going to be revealed in the last reel that he (playing himself) was the supervillain behind all the bloodshed.

As it is, he has a certain wolfish look to him, and the way he hits of Christina Ricci is supposed to creep you out (or else it's supposed to illustrate that becoming a werewolf has made her catnip to men of all ages).  Scott doesn't look that great,. but he looks better than Craig Kilborn, who I imagine in the first version wound up a victim of the beast, for bumping Scott off his show at the last minute in favor of Carrot Top and Ashton Kutcher.

Ricci isn't bad, and neither is Jesse Eisenberg, but they must have been made into a brother and sister team at the very last minute, for some scenes I swear were filmed while there was supposed to be some romantic heat between them.

I saw an episode of Craig Kilborn in which he hugged the visiting pop singer Kylie Minogue, who's only five feet one or something, and super tall Kilborn towered over her so that it seemed she was  talking to his belt buckle.  How did they avoid similarly embarrassing scenes in CURSED between him and Ricci, who must be under five feet tall?  He plays her boss, brutish, nasty and short.  In real life he's got to be six eight or something.  Here they both are photographed as though they were normal people, a miracle!  Maybe that was the secret of the casting, the way that Nazimova's SALOME (1923) is rumored to have employed 100% gay and lesbian actors--in CURSED everyone's a physical freak in some way, the audience just has to guess how.",1152748800,3,2111,4.597333333333333

Right, this was a predictable film, but while the route and destination may have been known, the ride was still alot of fun. Okay, werewolves aren't horror, and haven't been since the 50s. Regardless, the movie more than manages to entertain, with the same dark humor reminiscent of ""American Werewolf In London/Paris"". The ultimate bad guy is pretty much obvious, even from the movies trailer. The humor is pretty much high-scholo level: Jimmy is constantly being harangued about being a ""fag"" by high-school stud Bo (Ventimiglia), but finds Bo knocking on his door one night when the super-sexual attraction of his werewolf powers kick in. The whole series of murders is basically a werewolf Fatal Attraction case (not wanting to spoil too much here).

Anyway, ""Cursed"" is worth being recommended.",1149465600,,561,5.142857142857143
2284090,3,B0009ETCVA,"Being a werewolf fan, I could recognize how some of things in the movie have been done over done before in werewolf films. One of the things I enjoyed most about the film is in one scene, it shows human footprints that eventually turn to wolf pawprints.  Like I said, the story has been done before, it's predictable. The pentagram on the palm of the hand reminded me so much of the 80's television series ""Werewolf"" where the werewolves would have pentagrams on the palm of their hands as well. Except their pentagrams would bleed before they changed.

The actors and actresses are what you expect, the entire film has teen horror written all over it. The werewolves were sadly not scar, mainly due to the CGI effect. I miss the days of the 80's when they actually used werewolf costumes in the films, some of those were actually scary. The werewolves here are actually cute.

Overall, I'd recommend this film to werewolf fans only. Casual viewers may be turned off by having to sit through another teen film. This isn't Craven's best, that's for sure but I have seen movies that are much worse.",1146268800,,1096,4.61025641025641
2284091,3,B0009ETCVA,"For years, vampires have been the darling of horror movies. I'm not quite sure why people are so fascinated by vampires, but there's about one vampire movie released every year. Zombies come in a close second and have been gaining an edge over vampires in recent years as can be seen by the popularity of such movies as LAND OF THE DEAD, SHAUN OF THE DEAD, the remake of DAWN OF THE DEAD, the RESIDENT EVIL series, etc. Of all the undead creatures that Hollywood makes movies about, it is werewolves that are probably respected the least. Traditionally, werewolves have been seen as stupid and savage creatures unable to reasonably think while in wolf form.

CURSED is a movie that attempts to give werewolves some respect. In the film, siblings Ellie (Christina Ricci) and Jimmy Myers (Jesse Eisenberg) are driving home from downtown L.A. when they are involved in a car accident after a wolf jumps on top of their car causing them to swerve and hit another vehicle. They attempt to rescue the woman in the other vehicle from her entrapment, but in the process the woman is dragged away by a huge wolf and Ellie and Jimmy are both injured in the attack. As the siblings are attempting to escape, the half-devoured carcass of the injured woman is thrown towards them just as emergency personnel arrive on the scene.

Jimmy knows that the creature that attacked them was a wolf, but no one else seems to believe him and even Ellie can't support his claim. Jimmy begins doing some research and becomes convinced that the creature that attacked them was a werewolf. He tells Ellie this, but she doesn't believe him, despite a night of bizarre dreams and Jimmy waking up naked in the bushes outside.

As the day progresses, both Ellie and Jimmy become aware of changes occurring within them: heightened senses of smell, stronger sexual attraction, an increase of physical strength. Jimmy also discovers that a pentagram is forming on both he and Ellie's right palm. Eventually, Ellie comes to believe Jimmy's wild claim and together they try to uncover who the creature was that attacked them so that they can kill it and reverse the curse.

CURSED was plagued with problems during its production. At one point, over half the cast was replaced for one reason or another. The script was re-written several times and as a result the movie wasn't released until nearly a year-and-a-half after its original release date. Therefore, the final version of the film is completely different from the one that was originally envisioned and filmed. The movie was directed by Wes Craven and written by Kevin Williamson and together this talented duo was able to salvage a film that could have been a total disaster. The movie isn't as interesting as it could have been, but it still contains some comedy and is tied together rather nicely. CURSED doesn't quite resurrect the sub-genre of werewolf movies, but it does treat werewolves better than many other films (for instance werewolves in this movie are quite intelligent) and provides for an entertaining, but far from chilling movie-watching experience.

The unrated DVD version of the film really isn't that different from the rated version of the movie. There's just a little more blood and guts. Extra features on the DVD include selected scenes commentary with the special effects makeup supervisor and three behind the scenes featurettes. The highlight of the extra features is a short ""documentary"" by Jesse Eisenberg entitled BECOMING A WEREWOLF. This short film is fun with a little bit of wit and has Wes Craven in it acting as himself.",1145318400,,3583,4.867213114754098
2284102,1,B0009ETCVA,"Okay, I understand that there were production problems and  script issues and that the movie needed to be re-shot and re-cast and its release date was pushed back for over a year. Still, I rented this movie with fairly low expectations, thinking: Hey, it could at least be goofy. I might be able to laugh at the movie. And besides its Kevin Williamson and Wes Craven and Christina Ricci and doesn't she have indie cred? But alas even with lowered expectations - and I'm talking the cellar here, subterranean, tomb-like expectations - Cursed is a debacle. The original script, as I have read, centered on three strangers coming together via a car accident and are subsequently attacked by a werewolf. Sounds cool. I'll bite. How the story of Cursed evolved from that premise to this one is the real question. Forget the lightening in a bottle Williamson and Craven caught with their first collaboration, I'm going to go out on a limb and say that the original script was probably pretty good. Now, how does a good script get turned into this sludge factory of a boring, repetitive, contrived, laughable, plodding, abysmal, dim-witted piece of schlock? Dimension Films is infamous for doing just this, taking a descent original idea and pissing all over it. So, if blame must be ascribed, blame Dimension Films. Craig Kilborn and Scott Baio, both playing themselves, and a fine job of doing so from each, are the only rays of light in this soulless abyss of a film. Half way through you can actually feel Wes Craven's spirits broken and hear him saying: To hell with it. Just shoot the thing. Finish it. Put me out of my misery. Indeed.

For those familiar with werewolf movies you're expectations are probably pretty low all ready. Even so, this is likely to let you down considering the casting.

With most movies in this vein you at least get a sense for what was being attempted. That's not this movie. They don't seem to have ever decided exactly what is was they wanted and it shows.

First the script; It's awful.

There are very low budget werewolf movies that made more sense internally and didn't make the characters sound like imbeciles the way this one does. The plot holes are so obvious that it's sad. Almost more like the notes for the script were used because if this was thought out then Kevin Williamson should never be allowed to hack out another script. The humor is only passably amusing and the scares aren't very scary.

The directing is a typical Wes Craven movie; you put the actors in front of the camera. Add screaming and a lot of blood, and see what they'll do. Owing to the fact that several of them are TV actors, this turns out to not be much.

The CGI is fair to laughable with the beast actually shrinking while he is chasing a victim in a parking garage.

The stunt work is competent enough.  I think the suit looked better than the CGI for the most part. The fact that you can tell which is which should give you a good clue for the quality of film making here.

Having said all that, the movie isn't totally unenjoyable. Again, the lower your expectations the less squirming you'll do.

I rented it because of Christina Ricci and she is, as usual, cute and competent. Mostly the others just do what you see them do on TV which has a whole set of lower expectations by it's very nature. Even so, it is a shame to have wasted what talent is here on this mess of a script.

If you're new to werewolf movies and are looking for something good, well as the rest of you probably know all ready, the list is still very short. The Howling (the first one and only the first one), Dog Soldiers, and Wolfen (a psuedo-werewolf movie, but excellent). If instead you're looking for a time killer, give this a try.",1143590400,2,2187,4.375308641975309

2284105,3,B0009ETCVA,"Very weak opening and prolonged conclusion betrays the troubled production history of `Cursed' directed by Wes Craven and penned by Kevin Williamson, golden duo behind the success of `Scream.' Though it is obviously no `Scream,' however, the film provides a certain amount of fun with tongue-in-cheek attitudes towards the horror films, this time were-wolves.

After the shaky opening, `Cursed' gets better when Ellie, Christina Ricci's character working for a TV station, and her geeky brother Jimmy (Jesse Eisenberg) are both bitten by an unidentified animal on the Mulholland Drive. And what would happen to them when the moon is shining bright at night? Ricci get sexier, and Eisenberg gets hunkier. No much can be found except the transformation of Christian Ricci, which is fun to see.

[SCARY?  NOT EXACTLY...] But don't look for scares. The CGI/special make-ups are sometimes (probably intentioanally) cheesy and lack great impact. The film is in fact more about serial murders in LA, and as to the identity of the killer (or killers), Wes Craven certainly keeps us guessing the truths until the very end. But as a horror film `Cursed' is not as scary as his other horror films in the past though Craven gives one good sequence about the deadly chase between hunter and the hunted in the parking lot. `Cursed' is most entertaining when it parodies the rules of were-wolf films and teenage high-school dramas, and some intentionally silly dialogues exchanged between Jesse Eisenberg and Milo Ventimiglia are pretty funny.

But the film is most funny when scene-stealing Judy Greer appears on the screen. Actually, she is much better than any other actors in this film, knowing exactly what she should do in this kind of pop-corn film. Her knowingly campy acting is pure delight, and gives one reason not to miss this otherwise mediocre horror film that does not deserve the name of Wes Craven.

But doesn't it really? Perhaps without Wes Craven, `Cursed' would have been a real mess. It still looks messy as a horror with confusing and unnecessarily extended conclusion, but it is still entertaining in its own way. Not that it is good as genuine horror, but as entertainment it works up to a certain point.",1143158400,,2214,5.005434782608695

Sadly, Cursed is a real squandering of talent. It can be entertaining, but the plot is so weak and transparent that it becomes distracting, and is there really a need to continue pillaging plot points out of Cheney's werewolf films from 70 years ago? During the commentary Ricci states that you can't do a ""serious"" werewolf film anymore, which I can understand, but you can still attenpt to make a *quality* film that also has werewolves in it. Or, just have the wherewithal to make an all-out comedy. The filmmakers are too uncommitted here to creep you out when they're trying to, or to get the laughs they aim for. With the recent reinvention of so many genres, and the popularity of weird takes on supernatural themes (such as the Bizarro movement) there's no excuse to persist with the 1950's monster movie archtypes. There are some good moments when Ricci is at the office and smalls blood, the scene with Shannon Elizabeth trapped in her car, and the hilarious werewolf flipping the bird. The shoddy teen drama with the younger brother adds nothing (aside from showcasing the brother's underdeveloped acting ability).

On a more somber note, I watched this piece of crap, and couldn't stand it. Really bad acting and the story line was derived and cliche.

Two kids, two highschool kids... wait, one highschool kid and one twenty-something, get bitten by a large oversized wolf/bear creature, and they don't know what it is. Haven't these two ever watched tv? Silver Bullet(crap), American werewolf in London?

Well, the cliche dorky kid who was bitten by the wolf has a hunch right away, because he just happens to catch some newscast tipping him off to peculiar, unexplained animal attacks. Hmmm... So, the dork investigates, relying on, I can't believe this, comic books! On a good note, the wolf powers have made him stronger, more attractive to girls, and apparently a new wardrobe just appeared out of nowhere.

Why is everyone being so unkind to it?  It is entertaining, but more than that it is full of funny moments and quick witticisms that you have to be alert to catch.  Time will be kind to this film, I think, because the producers seem to have been aware that nothing new could be said about the subject matter so instead have some fun with it.  There is, for example, an excrutiatingly funny scene in which the wolf transformation of very vain young woman is coaxed out of hiding by affronting her vanity.  Now, the film is very rich in gay references and subplot, which I personally liked but will not appeal to everyone.  The plot does go astray there, because I sense something was being said about the ""curse"" of the werewolf being akin to the ""curse"" of being gay or having AIDS, but the point was not made. Now that I know of its many rewrites I see that something went wrong there.  But be that as it may.  It's a fun film, if you're open to it and alert to the jokes.  Wes Craven does not make masterpieces -- no one could accuse him of that -- but he does make entertaining films.  This picture is better than some of the work he has done but not worse.  And for what it's worth, Jesse Eisenberg is one sexy guy (get into the movie to see his transformation).  I think Michael Fox had a very homophobic line in Teen Wolf where he says, ""I'm not gay.  I'm a werewolf.""  There are no gay werewolves in this film, either, that we know of, but it's made abundantly clear that if there were it would be okay.  I like that.

Wes Craven released two movies in 2005. Red Eye was the mid-level hit; Cursed was the flop. I've yet to see Red Eye (a few weeks from now, I hope), but it's pretty easy to see why Cursed fared the way it did.

Ellie (Christina Ricci, still looking like an Edward Gorey drawing) and her younger brother Jimmy (The Village's Jesse Eisenberg) are driving home one night (after a good deal of setup) when something hits their windshield. The car goes out of control and slams into another car, driven by Becky (American Pie beauty Shannon Elizabeth). Ellie and Jimmy try to extract Becky from the wreck, but she is attacked and killed by a large wolf, who also injures both Ellie and Jimmy. It is, of course, a werewolf, and so the two of them are cursed to become werewolves. This, of course, is not a big help in Ellie's job, or her rocky relationship with ladies' man Jake (The Skulls' Joshua Jackson), though Jimmy, despite some embarrassing moments, is finding it quite an aid to his awkward high school years. Jimmy finds out that in order to remove the curse, they have to kill the originating werewolf, and the hunt is on.

It seems Kevin Williamson may have run out of ideas for hip, funny horror flicks, because this one isn't terribly hip, and for the most part, it isn't funny, either. And, like the rest of the horror films he's penned, it's certainly not scary. What it is, however, is reasonably watchable, as long as you can stomach lots of young-and-beautifuls who normally appear on ""the WB"" (the dumbest network name ever, perhaps?). It's paced well, and as a modern take on the werewolf story, it's not worse than any twenty werewolf movies made during the fifties. Unfortunately, it's no better, either, which makes it come off as a rather tired Ginger Snaps retread. **",1137456000,2,1814,4.627329192546584
2284119,3,B0009ETCVA,"After a year of excruciatingly bad horror movie releases, this slick werewolf film is a welcome change. By no means am I saying it's a masterpiece or that it will become a classic of the genre but the film gets major points for being enjoyable and Christina Ricci never looked better.

The story centres around a young woman (Ricci) and her teenage, nerdy younger brother who are involved in a car crash. At the crash site, one of the victims (Shannon Elizabeth) is brutally attacked by a massive beast who also manages to scratch the 2 main characters. The rest of the film deals with Ricci's stormy relationship with the mysterious Joshua Jackson and her slow metamorphosis into a lycanthrope.

When compared to the several horror movie atrocities released in 2005, ""Cursed"" looks good in comparison. It features an attractive cast and several scenes of intense bloodshed which may please undiscriminating gore-hounds. However, when compared to ""The Howling"" or ""An American Werewolf In London"", it's seriously lacking. The film's biggest disappointment is in the uninspired CGI transformations and special effects. If you're a die-hard werewolf film buff expecting an impressive mutation scene, you will be greatly disappointed. But it should be expected since most of the horror movies, especially the werewolf themed ones released within the last 10 years, have relied heavily on CGI.

When will Hollywood learn that CGI is slowing causing the demise of the horror genre?

With that said, ""Cursed"" is miles away from being awful. It offers the viewer some unexpected thrills, chills and a few chuckles. Even if you vowed never to watch another scary movie ever again (after watching last years ""Boogeyman"", I did just that) you may find that this rather charming little horror flick is just what you've been looking for. It's not Craven's best but it's definitely one of his better efforts.

2284120,2,B0009ETCVA,"WARNING: possible spoilers ahead...

Howly crap! This may be the worst werewolf movie ever!! The movie that reunited the Scream Team of Wes Craven and Kevin Williamson, Cursed is one of several R-rated horror films that suffered from the runaway box office success of PG-13 horror films like the Ring. Apparently, the big brains at Dimension thought that they needed to try to make Wes Craven's werewolf opus into a more teen-friendly film. No doubt this after-market butchering of the film hurt CURSED quite a bit, but sadly it's not the only reason that this movie is a flop. The unrated version that you can get on DVD now is slightly better than what came out in the theaters, but this is still a pretty mangy werewolf movie.

Christina Ricci and her nerdy brother are bitten by a werewolf in the first ten minutes of the movie. After that, we watch as they each gradually discover that they are lycanthropes. Christina Ricci is some kind of talk show producer. As the full moon approaches and she turns more vulpine, Christina starts taking control of her career and standing up to her bitchy rival at work. She's basically like Jack Nicholson's character in WOLF. In the meantime, nerdy brother starts going through his own transformation. His storyline is a pretty straight adaptation of TEEN WOLF. He's the nerdy guy who suddenly becomes a hunk and gets the hot cheerleader. There's also a third member of the family who is infected... the Golden Retriever. The retriever becomes a were-dog-wolf. Yes, it's as ridiculous and goofy as it sounds. I think even with an R-rating, someone should have vetoed the Were-Retriever.

Aside from the Were-Retriever, there are all kinds of other ridiculous characters in this movie. Josh Jackson meanders through every now and then for no particular reason. I still can't figure out for the life of me why Scott Baio is in this movie, playing himself. I kept waiting for him to either show up later in the movie, or be killed in a really disgusting way. Maybe it's just me, but I don't think that actors should ever play themselves in a movie. It hardly ever works, unless you're John Malkovich. And then there's our main characters, Christina and her nerdy brother. I guess they're supposed to be orphans. I never really figured out what happened to mom and dad, but they are never seen in the movie. It's like Kevin Williamson was trying to figure out how he could have a brother and sister turning into werewolves without the parents finding out, and so he just decided not to have any parents. Nothing like taking the easy way out there, Kevin.

I think maybe that's the problem with the whole movie. Kevin Williamson spent too much time on Dawson's Creek or something, and ended up writing a werewolf movie that feels like an after school special. This movie is nowhere near as good as some of the indie werewolf movies of the last couple of years like Ginger Snaps or even Dog Soldiers. With the way this movie turned out, I wouldn't be surprised if Kevin Williamson and Wes Craven were found to be responsible for setting the plight of werewolf movies back ten years.",1136592000,,3120,4.719266055045871

The plot isn't terribly realistic, as the story is about Ellie (Christina Ricci) and her young brother (Jesse Eisenberg), both bitten by a werewolf. One is in denial, the other isn't, and the most extraordinary things happen to them as they get to terms with the curse of the werewolf. Add to that Ellie's mysterious boyfriend (Joshua Jackson), a werewolf on the loose, a few murders, somewhat exaggerated special effects, and you have the recipe for ""Cursed"".

The major flaw in this movie is probably the ending, but I think that you can live with that if you just want to see an uncomplicated movie that keeps you entertained. Don't take ""Cursed"" seriously, and enjoy it. If you think you can do that, and you like horror/paranormal movies with some comic elements, then this is likely to be a good movie for you.

2284132,1,B0009ETCVA,"The synopsis does a good job of explaining what this movie is.  Brother and sister get attacked by werewolf....hygenks ensue.

The Good: Well, I always try to find the good in every movie, but this one I am at a loss.  The only good thing I could think of was at least it wasn't longer.  Ohh, Scott Beyo plays himself for a couple of cuckels.

The Bad:  Ohh, what a list I could write.  The story is mediocer and we have seen it before, the charecters are terrible, and the dialoge is worse.  Early in the film you see a cool (ish) CG werewolf which is done well enough to be cool, but it is clear they ran out of money, because later we see a person is a werewolf costume that could have only been made by a blind 12-year old.  It's that bad.  Then (and I am sure every review has hit this low point), the person it the chewbacca-rip off suit gives the cops the finger.  I think that was the point in the movie where I slipped into a coma.  Also, the werewolf dog got to me, because I can't help but think ""isn't a dog pretty close to a wolf already"".  Oh, and the acting is farily bad also, which is to bad because I like several of the actors.

Conclusion:  I can't say this is the worst movie I have ever seen, but it comes in second...and I have seen alot of stinkers.  Don't watch this movie...don't buy this movie....don't rent this movie...in fact, to be on the safe side, don't even talk about this movie.  Your frieds will thank you for it, I swear.

2284133,2,B0009ETCVA,"It's sad to see the greater names in Horror fall to such levels, and even sadder to see a trademark persona of Hollywood Horror be shamed into a teen-girl movie. Yeah, that's what this is.

The movie starts with two equally-suffocating look-a-like bimbos, and of course, a hokey fortune teller. She says that bad things will happen, and wouldn't you know it, they both get killed by a large animal. What kind of animal is it? Well, don't feel bad if you don't know; the writers and creature designers for the film didn't seem to either.  It really looks more like a grizzly bear than any lupine animal I have seen in any publication or zoo. So ok, the Were-Bear eats people, that's all fun and good, right? No, apparently the Were-Bear has a thirst for blood rather than flesh, and those who are bitten begin to exude sexuality. So now we will call it Vampire-Were-Bear.

Ok, so now that we've established the Vampire-Were-Bear character, let's talk some about plot. An animal attack, two siblings bitten, nerdy brother taps the endless fountain of knowledge--a ""credible"" website (cuz, you know, they monitor what people put on the internet for its authenticity...this review is a prime example of that) and his comic book collection. Sure enough, his symptoms match up with the descriptions, and so do his sister's. So what now? Well, here it comes, yes, we have to now kill the Head Vampire-Were-Bear!! Oh MAN! Who saw that one coming??? But here's the tricky part...who is it?  Well, it shouldn't be hard to figure this out, the movie only has 6 characters with real names. Interestingly enough, it tries to make you believe it is 3 of them before revealing the true culprit...well, sort of. Process of elimination figures the movie out for you 20 minutes before you get to the ""surprise.""

The film, despite boasting the names of Wes Craven (dir.) and Christina Ricci (starring), feels all too much like an ""Insert Vampire-Were-Bear here"" version of the Joel Schumacher 1987 teen-horror, ""The Lost Boys,"" though thankfully ""Cursed"" is without an adolescent Corey Feldman marching his upper lip up and down the screen.

""Cursed"" is a great film for those of you who would like to see ""10 Things I Hate About You 2: Vampire-Were-Bear Gets Dumped."" All others wanting a wereWOLF flick might try Underworld or go back to the classics. The camera shots were decent, and suspense was pretty good at some parts, though I was hugely dissappointed in Vampire-Were-Bear, who didn't seem like it could hunt its own tail with bells tied to it in a well-lit room.

Hmmmm...I just don't know where to begin. To sum it up, the acting is terrible, the story is lame and the special effects aren't really anything to howl at either. For god sakes there's a werewolf, towards the end, that flips off someone because she called it fat and said it had a big butt. Sound funny? Well the movie wasn't meant to be funny. It works with Freddie Kruger, but not a crazed blood thirsty werewolf.

Look I don't want to dwell on one thing because there are so many things that made this movie terrible but I couldn't help but notice that Christina Ricci was really awful in this flop of a werewolf movie. Her acting looked so rehearsed and unmotivated. It was just so obvious she wasn't into this movie or perhaps she just sucks in all her movies and ""THE Addams Family"" was the only good movie she's ever done? *SIDE NOTE* Is it me or could a skilled pilot land a plane on that forehead of hers?

Anyway, trust me, this movie is crap! I waisted my money on it and I wish I'd taken other bad reviews to heart. This movie is an insult to werewolves everywhere...well...werewolf movies at least.

2284139,3,B0009ETCVA,"From the creators of the Scream. That was almost enough to sell this movie to me in and of itself. The fact that it was a werewolf story, a subgenre done to death true, but with a fresh point of view did the rest.

Christina Riici(grown into a lovely young actress) stars as Ellie an assistant on the Late Late show, Jesse Eisenberg portrays her brother the typical high school geek. The two are on their way home when a car accident changes their lives for the worse.

I knew when I inserted the DVD into my player not to expect a too serious horror movie. With Williamson's script I expected as many laughs as shivers and found that definitely to be the case. In the screenplay Williamson has seemingly taken the best elements of the lighter side of horror and added his own sendup in inside lines and setting. Williamson also writes young angst really well, and this reviewer would have been more impressed by this aspect but it has been examined by various hollywood scribes to death. The positive side of this critique though is I got the impression Williamson realized this and even kept the angst of teenagehood from being too heavy a subplot.

As stated by others there were some wildly predictable points in the film and without them this movie would have undoubtedly rated 4 stars from me. Point of fact this is modelled after the Scream francise to a great extent so as one should not take An American Werewolf in London or King's Silver Bullet too seriously, so too is this film not meant to be taken too seriously.

The actors including Mya all did a fine job with script given, and Eisenberg is so good at playing the outsider teenager he almost stole the show in this movie.

The special features were interesting but I would have liked some deleted scenes or maybe bloopers. Otherwise I recommend this movie highly bearing in mind it is not a likely Oscar bait movie.",1131148800,4,1883,4.542772861356932

2284151,1,B0009ETCVA,"CURSED is another really dumb horror movie, this time focusing on werewolves. Of course, it's hard to tell if the movie is supposed to be a campy, sarcastic film like Scream or a true horror movie. Although it offers funny touches like a Scott Baio cameo, it's not clever and biting enough to be a send-up of horror movies, but it's not scary enough to be a horror movie, either. Basically, it's a just a mess of a movie -- that's the best that can be said about it.

Here's the premise: Twenty-something Ellie (Christina Ricci) and her teen brother Jimmy get into a car accident on a dark, winding road. They try to free the other driver of the car (Shannon Elizabeth), only to see her get dragged away by a large wolf. Ellie and Jimmy get scratched by the wolf, but don't think anything of it right away. After all, Ellie is focused on work and her new boyfriend Jake (Joshua Jackson) and Jimmy is busy trying to make it through the horrors of high school, where he is the victim of some bullying boys from the wrestling team. But soon tell-tale signs that Ellie and Jimmy were infected by a werewolf start emerging, and the siblings find themselves fighting the urge to go to the dark side.

The movie, which was originally rated R, was reshot and then edited down to become a PG-13. It appears that a sensible plot and any kind of character development were edited out as well (what happened to Ellie and Jimmy's parents, by the way?). And they must have run out of money before they hired the special effects team, because the computer-generated werewolves look fake and decidedly not scary. They would have been better off not showing the werewolves at all, because then the anticipation of seeing the beasts would create some real interest and suspense.

Bottom line: If teens are looking for some real thrills, they're better off seeing a movie like The Ring.",1129766400,4,1867,4.567164179104478
2284152,3,B0009ETCVA,"This movie has a lot of things going for it.  It has a likable cast, an engaging premise and, most of all, horror mastermind Wes Craven at the helm.  Unfortunately, it never quite reaches its potential.  It's a fun movie, but not as good as expected.

I think this all comes down to Craven not knowing what exactly he wants this film to be.  Is it a horror parody in the same vein as the Scream trilogy or is it a straight-forward werewolf movie?  It's like he teeters between these two options.

The horror elements are well done.  It's been a while since I've seen a decent modern werewolf movie, but the humor factor takes a lot away from things.

That's not to say the humor isn't well-written; it is.  I particularly enjoyed the cameos by former talk show host Craig Kilborn and Chachi Arcola himself, Mr. Scott Baio.  I just don't think the horror and the humor blended well.

I still recommend this to fans of horror.  I just think this is a movie you should rent, not buy.  It's a good film for a rainy Sunday afternoon, but that's about it.  It's not a long-lasting classic like most of Craven's other entries in the genre.",1129593600,,1132,4.400966183574879
2284153,3,B0009ETCVA,"It's been a while since we've had a good werewolf movie.  Is Cursed the film to end the drought?  Well, kind of:  it's more like a heavy drizzle...it doesn't end the drought but it at least gets things wet.  Shedding the metaphors for a moment, Cursed is a decent movie, but it's got too many little problems to really be good.

With direction by Wes Craven and writing by Kevin Williamson, this movie obviously attempts to do for the werewolf movie what the same duo's Scream did for the slasher flick.  (Of course, the werewolf movie is not quite as overdone as the slasher movie, so the need for parody is not as great.)  As a result, we get a movie featuring characters in their late teens and early twenties who are savvy about the conventions of horror and plenty of references to old movies.

Christina Ricci plays a sort of assistant producer who along with her brother (Jesse Eisenberg) get involved in a car accident on a lonely stretch of L.A.'s Mulholland Highway.  They first hit what turns out to be a werewolf, then another car containing Shannon Elizabeth.  All three survive relatively intact until the werewolf strikes, leaving only the siblings alive but injured (and cursed).  What follows is a slow transformation for the pair which is not fully bad: for the nerdy brother, it is a chance to finally to one-up some school bullies and win the girl of his dreams (shades of Teen Wolf).

The main problem with this movie is that the creators suffer from the success of Scream.  In their ambition to repeat that success, they come up short.  The result is a film that is often more clever than it needs to be and with humor that is more forced than natural.  On the other hand, there are some moments that are genuinely funny and some decent twists.  The bad and the good more or less offset each other, leading to a three-star effort.  If you are a fan of monster movies, this is probably worth watching, but don't expect too much.",1129075200,,1949,4.538681948424069
2284154,3,B0009ETCVA,"Christina Ricci, Shannon Elizabeth, Wes Craven running the show, a script by Kevin Williamson, perhaps the best werewolf special effects ever seen - sounds like a sure winner, doesn't it?  Somehow, though, Cursed plays as flat as a fritter.  It's almost painfully predictable, shows no spark of life whatsoever, and comes off as nothing more than exceedingly competent.  I really don't know much about the troubled production of the film, but it seems to me that it could have used at least one more rewrite.  I have a hard time getting past the ending when I think of this film - not the climax, but the very final scene which goes so far out of its way to cover all of the old Hollywood cliches that it (unlike the actual werewolf scenes) almost made me cringe.  And where did they dig up Scott Baio?  More importantly, why did they dig up Scott Baio?

Things started off on a bad foot for me.  I've never seen Shannon Elizabeth actually look plain before, and I just could not buy Portia de Rossi as a fortune-telling gypsy.  Was the old crag gypsy union on strike or something?  Then you've got the prototypical high school outcast with a crush on a little cutie just happens to be dating your typical high school athlete/bully.  Hmmm, do you think a little supernatural strength would come in handy for this guy?  Ricci plays his big sister Ellie; she works on the Late Show with Craig Kilborn and dates this sort of mystery guy (well, actually, there's no mystery about him at all for anyone with a functioning brain).  The gloom and doom siblings get bitten by a werewolf (although Ellie doesn't believe it until she can't deny it any longer), after which point we get yet another confused litany of werewolf ""truths,"" wait to get a look at the obligatory ""change,"" and then wonder why some werewolves transform into the beast while others keep scurrying around in their completely human forms.  If I'm a werewolf, and another werewolf attacks me, I'm going to turn into a werewolf myself, by gum.

The only thing this movie does well is the special effects - with one exception, which is not really wolf-related.  Early on, you only get quick snatches of the beast, and that strategy of delayed impact always works well.  Through the magic of CGI, the werewolf transformation is really quite impressive (gone forever are the days of time lapse photography), but by far the best effects are those of the dog werewolf - Cujo would have turned tail and run from this fellow.

It's hard to say why this movie doesn't seem to work.  In the end, it comes down to the fact that there just isn't any oomph here.  I was about as emotionally invested in Cursed as I would be in any old After-School Special - what makes that especially unusual is the fact that I love Christina Ricci.  With that pale white skin and dark hair, she almost always has an aura that dials right in to my frequency, but that aura just wasn't there in this film.

2284163,2,B0009ETCVA,"With out a doubt there was a lot of issues with this particular production. The story of how this film got made is probably,for most,far more interesting than the movie itself. This movie has be panned and slammed by most major movie critics and repelled by most horror fans as horrific as poodle gone rabid and even then the poodle rates as more scarey !!!

However, For those unawares of the troubled productions the studio wanted the film to kid friendly and be able to sell the movie to the teen market. This led to Wes Craven having to film a majority of new footage and re-edit for this market.

Furthermore, Mr Craven went all hissy over the CG footage - which when u see it is understandable.

With this in mind I tend to think that not all the blame can be throw like a giant furball in the directors direction. When one has a goal in life it is often altered and changed by outside
influences and the same can be seen with many movies.

Unfortunately for the werewolf fan this is not a film that is made with any love or style. Wes Craven's and Kevin Willamson's mark is felt all over this movie but gone is the overall success of mixing self referential humour and horror that is entertaining and fresh (think Scream).

Now don't get me wrong, im not defending Wes Craven as some loyal neurotic fan. I don't think the man is the MASTER OF HORROR nor do I look at every Wes Craven movie as a god sent to the horror world on celluloid. The man in my opinion is classified as the MASTER OF HORROR purely cause he has made or produced so MANY HORROR FILMS. In my books the man has made more duds than successes with both the first Nightmare on Elm Street and Scream being the successes.

I've seen his The Last House on the Left which I thought was extremely dated and actually more titillating than really setting new levels of dread and movies such as The Serpent and the Rainbow, Shocker and The People under the Stairs though good but are almostly b-grade in there deliveries. I don't mind b grade but it has to be edgy and fresh to be a true masterpiece.

So back to Cursed, the story is simple and I mean really simple. Sister and brother get marked by a werewolf and we spend the rest of the movie watching how their new werewolf genes mix with there teen lives. Thrown into the mix is that both are being stalked by the werewolf. The story line is simply go from point A to B to C to conclusion. All predictable, all wrapped in cheap transparent cellophane.

The problem with the film is that it holds no substance and can't decide which genre it wants to fit in, a dark werewolf film , a teen comedy, a teen drama or a post modern horror flicks.

It fails at all !!!

When comparing the film to other werewolf films it doesn't hold up. An American Werewolf in London has more to its humour and horror than this film ever had and Ginger Snaps is far more post modern werewolf than this scholck.

With all that said the film is watchable and will pass an hour a half but you certainly aren't going to remember this film as even remotely mind blowing.

Now to the one thing most wanna know: how does the werewolf look??? Well to be honest the CG is not too bad and not too good. It just unremarkable and you are going to have to suspend belief slightly not to be completely zoned out of the movie by some of the fakeness.

To but it simply the CG looks cartoony and too sharp to be real (not as bad as the wolf in An American Werewolf in Paris but very close).The costumed werewolf looks...well it looks like what it is...a person in a full puppet suit or a animatronic werewolf head. Overall it doesn't compliment the film.

Another aspect when thinking of this film is that there are two copies circulating, one is a pg type offering while the other has some gore.

Clearly the unrated copy is the one to get view !!!

Unfortunately for most Australians this isn't possible yet as the pg version is the only one available at present down under but hopefully this will be rectified with a Special Edition.

In conclusion this is a lite werewolf affair that has been produced and manufactured as a business venture not with true love for the genre or a respect for the horror fan. For me it almost verges on a Wes Craven version of Teen Wolf and even that was a better film for what is was and that saying something !!!!

Hollywood horror movies, I really shouldn't bother with them, but I thought Kevin Williamson, Christina Ricci, it should be kinda good, but ten minutes in I was on the verge of turning it off from boredom, and I stayed that way as I endured the rest of the film. I don't understand how Kevin Williamson could write a script this weak. Any random 40ish minute episode of Dawson's Creek has more wit and plot substance than this 90 minute film. And this is a movie right? So you expect higher standards, you expect more time and effort to be put into it, but this script is so by-the-book and so not clever at all. I wasn't expecting a particularly original plot, just some quirky characters and witty dialogue to keep it interesting, but both were almost entirely absent. It also has the worst werewolf costume/cgi I've ever seen. Is someone's head turning into a flesh-colored apple supposed to be scary?

2284169,2,B0009ETCVA,"A brother and sister team are biten by a werewolf that then stalks them. I'm usually a fan of Wes Craven, but he missed by a mile on this one.

This is a hugely flawed story. The brother and sister are biten by a werewolf, but still run when it shows up. Why? What are they afraid of, aren't they already cursed?

Then there is the flaw of the werewolf that made them wanting to destroy them? Why did he turn them to werewolves in the first place if he just wanted to kill them? Didn't he make killing them harder by turning them into something supernatual? He could have just killed them in the beginning.

Also, Craven strays from the werewolf legend by making the werewolves retain their control and ability to reason when morphed into full werewolf. It would be scarier to make the werewolves into out of control creatures that mindlessly kill without reason.

There were a couple attempts at humor that did not help the story and came across as cheesy. Not what I want in a werewolf flick.",1123632000,3,994,4.415300546448087

When out at night, a strange beast attacks Ellie and Jimmy.  Jimmy is the first to figure out that the beast was a werewolf, and must convince Ellie of this.

In the meantime, Ellie seems to gain more confidence, giving herself more style in her dress and not being such a tool to her distant boyfriend Jake (Joshua Jackson).  The film drags a bit through the middle, but has a action ending infused with dark comedy.  (a la Evil Dead, but not as good)

Christina Ricci and Shannon Elizabeth (the snotty Becky) pull the movie up from being much worse.  The script needed work, but the werewolf transformations are pretty cool, as is the werewolf itself.  It's not hard to guess who the original werewolf is (in my opinion) but the ending was still enjoyable if not a little bit clich.  The club atmosphere added to the fun.

Maybe that's why so many actors and actresses that are normally great deliver such poor performances in this over acted, under directed, piece of formula writing. Though I am a fan of `bad' b horror movies, even my love of them couldn't help me tolerate this film.

I thought about how to write this review without giving any spoilers, well, watch five minutes of the film, then think about the next formula, pat, unexciting thing that could happen, and boom, you're there, it just happened. There are no twists and turns in the plot, it's calm as a still pond and smooth as glass, so it had the general effect of luring you to sleep.

Even the special effects are nothing new or exciting. Matter as fact, they're pretty amature, looking like they were created in Maya by a couple of college students that are getting poor grades in art class.

If you're thinking about watching this, or worse yet, buying it. Don't. Howling is a werewolf movie classic and well worth your time. But if you invest yourself in Cursed, you'll just come out feeling cheated.

Wes owed Dimension one more movie and that ended up being Cursed. Now what we have here isn't even that film he started to make. Craven originally filmed most of this movie in an almost entirely different version that Dimension decided they didn't like because it was a HORROR movie and wasn't hip and funny enough. That's when Kevin Williamson rewrote the script to be this piece of poo that we all watched. So Wes had to re-shoot the movie to suit the new script. Basically he hates it, and his new movie coming out, Red Eye, is for I believe Dreamworks pictures not Dimension.

Wes Craven, Werewolves, Scott Baio...I mean all the elements of making a really scary movie and it was almost like he just stopped caring. To be honest the werewolf didn't look that bad, actually it was pretty good but you need to focus on the story as much you do the visuals, that's what made Nightmare on Elm Street so memorable. I guess I can't only blame Wes Craven for this but come on Wes you are better then this...

There are vintage Crav-ster (that's what I call him) moments in this movie but not enough to carry it.

I was a little disappointed in Christina Ricci's performance, I usually enjoy her acting, but didn't in this one.

2284189,3,B0009ETCVA,"CURSED is the story of a brother and sister who are attacked by a werewolf and become infected.  Prior to this incident, Ellie's (Christina Ricci) biggest problems were an emotionally distant boyfriend and a snotty PR representative at her company, while Jimmy (Jesse Eisenberg) mostly had to put up with the homophobic bullies at his high school.  I guess sometimes we just don't know when we have it good.  Jimmy, a comic book geek, is quick to accept the possibility of what has happened to them and begins research immediately, while Ellie remains skeptical until the physical evidence becomes irrefutable.

With Wes Craven's track record (even his lesser films at least dealt with more original subject matter) one had to wonder why he wanted to make such a formulaic movie about such a well-worn concept.  [Edit: I have since learned that this movie was a result of contractual obligation.]  The first act of the movie felt quite tired, with dozens of unimaginative scares that have been seen time and time again.  A dream sequence in particular is a real groaner.  However, it actually does get better as it goes on.  While it still retains an air of predictability, it did surprise me at times.  I really thought it was obvious who the lycanthropic antagonist was.  I wasn't completely wrong, but I wasn't exactly right, either.

In the end, CURSED is a passably entertaining movie made so primarily by the cast, which also includes Joshua Jackson (THE SAFETY OF OBJECTS) and Judy Greer (ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT).  Portia de Rossi (also ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT) appears in a small role, and Scott Baio appears as himself.  As a bonus, we get to see Shannon Elizabeth (JAY AND SILENT BOB STRIKE BACK) get ripped in half.  Always a treat.

The unrated DVD contains a number of featurettes: a making-of with cast interview clips, one on effects, one on editing, and a humorous short film on ""making a werewolf.""  There is also effects commentary for certain scenes.",1122076800,49,1964,4.903030303030303
2284190,3,B0009ETCVA,"If Kevin Williamson and Wes Craven want to write and direct an R-rated werewolf movie, then you would think with their respective track records they should be allowed to do it.  But that is not what happened with ""Cursed,"" and the studio edited it down to a PG-13 version.  Whatever their motivation, I am inclined to think that avoiding having a hit like the R-rated ""Scream"" trilogy was not their goal.  Still, the film Williamson and Craven created was butchered, they washed their hands of the film, and ""Cursed"" ended up on the shelf for a while.

Ellie Myers (Christina Ricca) is a segment producer for Craig Kilborn (Craig Kilborn), who is driving home with her brother, Jimmy (Jesse Eisenberg) when there is an accident.  While trying to rescue a woman (Shannon Elizabeth), they are attacked by a werewolf.  The woman ends up dead, while Ellie and Jimmy are now at risk for turning into beasts.  We know this and Jimmy suspects it, but Ellie is going to take some convincing.  After all, it was dark and there was a forest, so who knows what is really out there in the night.  Then there is the question of who is the werewolf, because you know it has to be somebody that Ellie knows and there is either an obvious suspect or one of the more blatant red herrings in horror movie history (take your pick).

I did not see ""Cursed"" in the theater and I have no interest in seeing the ""rated"" version, so I cannot speak to how big of a crime against humanity can be pinned on the studio.  For that matter, I am not absolutely sure that this unrated version reflects the vision of Williamson and Craven.  What I can say is that I do not find ""Cursed"" to be an inventive revitalization of the werewolf film, which, I assume, was supposed to be the goal here.  The problem is that Jimmy is a lot more interesting than Ellie, and is the main character.  What happens between Jimmy and Bo (Milo Ventimiglia) the school bully is a lot more interesting than what anything happening with Ellie.  If anything, she is a bit denser than most movie heroines, even when things are laid out for her.  Another part of the problem is that since we are talking Kevin Williamson we are expecting the script to play with the rules of the werewolf game a bit more than this one.  Instead, the pivotal issue in the film has to do with the metallic composition of a picture frame (then again, if you had to find something silver in your household right this very minute, what could YOU come up with?).

But the two key elements of any werewolf movie are, first, what does the beast look like, and, second, how tragic the target human happens to be.  The werewolf in ""Cursed"" is okay looking, but Ellie is not a particularly tragic figure and that ends up being more important.  I know because after watching this circa 2005 film the recommendation I want to make is for fans of the werewolf genre to go check out the ""Ginger Snaps"" trilogy, where the Fitzgerald sisters are a lot more interesting.  Or if you really want something innovative involving werewolves go check out ""Brotherhood of the Wolf"" (""Le Pacte des loups"").  Because whether you compare ""Cursed"" to other werewolf films or the ""Scream"" trilogy, you are going to be disappointed.",1121904000,3,3228,4.548442906574395

2284192,3,B0009ETCVA,"I have seen many other horror movies that were a lot worse than Cursed. I, after seeing Darkness and so many other sillier horror movies, actually did not think this movie was all too bad. Sure, it had its silly points, the points where you roll your eyes and scoff, but there are other times when it was not too bad of a horror flick. They have their high moments, unfortunately there were a lot of low moments too. I did actually think Wes Craven's film would be better, but I didn't hate it. I wouldn't buy it, but I wouldn't mind watching it on tv once or twice again. It was one of those films you watch with your friends for fun.

The biggest problem with this movie really was it was TOO predictable. I knew almost every single thing that was going to happen. At the end I was not at all surprised who was the main enemy and the whole reason behind this certain enemie's rampage is kind of silly. So yes, the movie does come up a bit short. It kind of saves itself in the final moments of the movie though with a final battle thats was pretty good. Still though, it was no five- star ending, and the whole atmosphere of this film is really a teen movie instead of an adult horror film. You want an adult werewolf film go check out Bad Moon, or American Werewolf in London, but not this- unless you want to just watch it for a few laughs, which is cool to do once and awhile. I mean, honestly, do all horror films need to be so serious? As long as they hold intelligence in the plot which is what Cursed actually held well. Besides, a lot of serious horror films aren't even that scary anyway either, they're usually just more gory.

For you horror fans who haven't watched it yet, it is basically another werewolf movie. I won't spoil anything for you but trust me as you get into the first half hour or so of the film you'll probably already figure out the film's ending like I did. Just enjoy it as more of a fun flick to watch with friends.",1121731200,4,1950,4.197333333333333

Why would Wes Craven, the creator of Freddy Krueger, sink to such a low and embarassing level? And why would Christina Ricci, such an amazing actress who gave her incredible talent to such films as Monster and Sleepy Hollow, agree to be in this train-wreck of a movie? And has Craven gone PG-13? What happened to the real horror movies? WHY ARE ALL THE HORROR FILMS GOING PG-13 TODAY?? It seems that R-rated horror films are slowly becoming extinct, the most recent theatrical  ones being George A. Romero's Land of the Dead, House of Wax, The Amityville Horror remake and High Tension. WHAT'S GOING ON?

There were SO SO SO SO SO MANY things wrong with Cursed. The two things that really bothered me was the ridiculous and unecessary amount of humor and the corny (and way TOO obviously fake) werewolf costume. I hate it when horror movies turn in to laugh-fests. What truly TRULY gets me is this: if Craven cared so much about this film, I mean, changing the script over and over, casting and re-casting, throwing so much money into what I read as being a 'BIG project', then why oh why was the final product so godawful? If he knew any better, he should've burned it instead of releasing it. Both Craven's money, time and effort and Ricci's talent were completely wasted.

So, save YOUR money and avoid Cursed or you'll be cursed...with losing 1 hour and 30 minutes of your life!

In recent years, werewolves have been given new treatment by such films as the GINGER SNAPS trilogy, but CURSED plays it safe in keeping within the framework of the more traditional folklore.  Kevin Williamson's screenplay has some witty moments, a few surprising plot twists, and the cast is more than adequate in bringing the story to life.  Judy Greer is exceptionally good as a witchy agent, and even Scott Baio gets to poke fun at himself.

2284216,4,B0009ETCVA,"Despite what I thought when I saw this in theaters, Cursed was not hurt by its PG-13 rating. In fact, I think it might have helped it. While nothing spectacular, Cursed is a terrific follow-up to the Scream films, and one of the most entertaining, if not the least violent, werewolf films out there. With its unfortunate and terrifying production history, I thought the film was going to end up one big mess, but it was fun, clever, and wildly entertaining. Having seen both the theatrical and Unrated versions, I think I prefer the theatrical version. The unrated version has a lot of unneccessary gore, that doesn't really help to improve the story or add anything new to the genre. The one scene I felt needed the gore when watching this in theaters, was the Mya death scene, but it was EXACTLY the same in the Unrated version. The rest of the gore stuff, about two minutes worth, was cheesy and unneccessary.

I felt the only thing I didn't like about the film was the cheesy, groan-inducing 'Happy Ending.' I think the film would have been a lot stronger without it, and would have definitely gotten a 5-star rating from me.

This is definiteltly not a horror film for all tastes. Much in the Scream vein, it has self-referential dialogue, characters who know they're in a horror movie, and lots of comedy. Fans of Scream should eat this up. All the fans of Wes Craven's older stuff should probably stay away.",1120262400,2,1414,4.629482071713148
2284227,4,B0009ETCVA,"I went into this movie with low expectations(partly because of all the negative talk about the movie).  But after seeing it, I thought it was quite a good popcorn-munching flick.

Look, movies such as this one are out there to entertain you.  This did that for me.  A few scares here and there.  Some decent special effects.  And some laughs which gave the movie some ""light heartedness"".  Casting Scott Baio as himself to promote some laughs was brilliant.  It was what I expected from Craven these days. If you go into it looking for Scream or Nightmare on Elm Street type scares, or try to disect the movie's plot to see if the premis is even plausible, then you will be dissappointed.  I suggest you don't do that.

This movie (I don't believe) was intended to scare you to death.  It was a campy horror/thriller/comedy that worked for me and may work for you.  Go into it with an open mind and I think you will be pleasantly surprised.

2284230,1,B0009ETCVA,"Remember Wes Craven?  The guy who made The Hills Have Eyes, Last House On The Left and Nightmare On Elm St?  This was the guy who scored tons of horror fans and won over critics by taking chances and breaking the rules.  A guy who had brilliant ideas and wasn't afraid to put them on film.  Well, I certainly miss him and hope he returns to us someday.  I think getting older(and richer) has made him a bit of wuss and tool for Hollywood producers(at least Cronenberg hasn't gone soft in his age).  Wes seems to have fallen victim to the cliches and drawbacks of the very genre he created with Scream-The Teenybopper horror flick.  While I'm not a big fan of Scream by any means, the film was groundbreaking, and Wes has a good track record of doing that.  While I still have respect for Craven, Cursed is one of the most godawful piles of steaming *@#$ I have ever seen.  I knew this film wasn't gonna be good, but not THIS bad.  This time around, Craven turns back to hipster horror writer Kevin Williamson to crank out another hit-this time about werewolves.  Williamson attemps to hipsterfy the werewolf legend with results so rotten, I don't have enough adjectives in my whole vocabulary to describe just how rotten it really is.  In fact, I don't have enough review space here to give all the reasons why Williamson should be blackballed from Hollywood for at least a decade(so he can hopefully mature a little).  Don't be too fooled by the ""Unrated"" tag that goes along with this edition, coz aside from one major scene and a few naughty words, this is just a big PG-13 teenybopper fluff episode of Dawson's Creek with werewolves.  The plot blatantly rips off plot points from American Werewolf In London, The Howling and even Teen Wolf for chrissakes!  The cgi transformations look atrocious as do the scenes of cgi werewolves running and leaping around.  The actual werewolf costume designed by Rick Baker actually looks very good-so good in fact that you wonder why they used cgi at all.  The film hits an all time low when the werewolf flips the bird to our heroes.  Even The Monster Squad didn't do something that stupid!  And speaking of The Monster Squad, at least the attempts at humor in that film worked some of the time-they sure don't in Cursed.  Cursed, like many werewolf films of late, includes that terrible plot device I call the ""werewolf cure"".  That vomit inducing scene where a character reveals that the one way to rid yourself of a werewolf curse is to kill the werewolf that bit you.  And did you notice that this werewolf is always the villian as well?  How convenient.  I don't consider this a spoiler coz if a character says it in the film, you know damn well it's gonna happen, why put it in the script otherwise?  This werewolf cure crap really pisses me off.  Basically it's only purpose is to assure a happy Hollywood ending to the film.  After all, we can't have that cutie-pie Christina Ricci gunned down naked in an alley now can we?  Part of the horror and hopelessness of the classic werewolf films is that there was no friggin' cure!!  The fact that getting bit by a werewolf is a death sentence is what makes the concept scary.  Don't waste your time with Cursed if you could be using that time to watch American Werewolf, The Howling or the original Wolf Man.  Hell, even grade-Z werewolf movies that have an actor running around with a wolf mask on will at least get a few chuckles out of ya and not make you wanna stomp on your dvd player.

2284236,3,B0009ETCVA,"Since I liked the ""Scream"" trilogy by Wes Craven, I decided to watch ""Cursed"". After watching the movie, I didn't find it so bad, but it wasn't the best teen horror movie that I had seen either. In other words, it was average.

The story is very simple. It's about Ellie (Christina Ricci) and her brother Jimmy (Jesse Eisenberg), who get into this car crash one night while driving, and get bitten by a werewolf. They start experiencing changes, and have to somehow stop it before it gets too late.

I wouldn't call ""Cursed"" the worst horror movie made (especially after watching `Alone in the Dark' recently). It was, actually what I expected. I mean, this is a teen horror movie, so obviously it focuses towards the younger generation, and won't contain too much horror in it. It was funny at times, it has its amount of gore (Becky being amputated), and twists and turns as to who the actually werewolf was. The only two disappointing things that I can actually find in the movie are the: 1) bad CGI effects. First of all, the werewolves look like bears instead of werewolves. When the person is turning into the werewolf, it looks like something taken from an animated cartoon. 2) When the werewolf shows the middle finger to Ellie in the end, it just looks stupid! I thought that this could have been easily omitted.

The cast acted adequately to their roles. Wes Craven didn't do such a bad job of ""Cursed"", but he could have revised it a little bit. On the whole, this movie isn't that great or anything, but after a bunch of flop horror movies (like 'Boogeyman'), this isn't so bad.",1119830400,3,1590,4.571929824561403

two words:  Pretty bad.

It was more of a comedy than anything, and watching it with that in mind, it was actually kind of enjoyable, but people who thought it was a horror movie would be pissed off, cause it was anything but.

Basically, a werewolf is loose in modern day hollywood. The main character played by christina ricci and her dorky brother get scratched by it, and so they begin to develop wierd abilites.

The werewolf is running around killing people though, and in the end they must find it and try to kill it, because by killing it, the ""curse"" will be lifted on them and they'll return to normal.

The ricci character was worthless, the brother was funny though. Being a dork in high school, he's always being picked on, and so as he gets stronger, he begins to fight back. There's a scene in which he cleans house on the wrestling team who are always picking on him, especially the team captain, who keeps accusing the dork of being gay, and in the end it's funny because it ends up that the team captain was actually gay himself! So that whole bit was kind of funny.

There's also a funny scene where the kids golden retriever turns into a werewolf-dog and chases them around.

And of course, they introduced many characters whose only point was to try and make you think the bad guy was different than the dude who was very obvious from the very beginning.

All in all, it was pretty stupid. It would have been just ""ok"" if it would have been released 15 years ago.

One thing that was wierd was, the end wrapped everything up. Usually with those types of movies, there's always an obvious cue for a sequal, or so you think that it's not really over. Not in this movie. and GOOD. This movie doesn't need any sequel.

2284267,3,B0009ETCVA,"If there is a film title that perfectly fits the goings on behind the scenes of a movie and it's production in general, it's ""Cursed"". Pretty much shot twice, with studio interference, script re-writes, cast changes, new characters, and pretty much everything changing, it's no wonder that director Wes Craven said this was the most unpleasant experience he has made making a movie. Surprisingly, it turned out a lot better than most would expect, and what a lot of people, critics and goregounds mostly, would make one believe. While it's far from being a really good movie without flaws, it is a decent little film that is easily watchable, and anyone could squeeze out some decent fun and entertainment from it. Brother and sister Ellie and teenaged Jimmy(Christina Ricci, Jesse Eisenberg), are two siblings living together in Los Angeles on their own as it seems their parents have died. She works for ""The Craig Kilborn Show"", and he is a geeky high schooler. One night driving on Mullohand Road, they hit an animal and are involved in a car wreck. Both bit and clawed from this mysterious animal, they begin to go through some changes. Jimmy is certain they were bitten by a werewolf, and as the changes set in, it appears that he is all too right and the brother and sister team must find the lead werewolf and kill it in order to restore themselves to their original nature. Written by ""Scream"" mastermind, Kevin Williamson, the movie seems to try to be a new and revolutionary type film the way ""Scream"" was, but fails. There is the modern, wink-wink type factor, and Williamson's witty, pop culture filled dialogue, but the film fails to deliver any real chills or scares. A lot of it is just the ""Boo"" shot with something running into someone and so on. It is a film that doesn't seem to be interested in being scary or suspenseful, but a film that lost it's edge with all of the backstage goings on, and now settles on just being a fun little ride with some deaths and a little mystery. Joshua Jackson co-stars as Ricci's boyfriend Jake, and he is one of the few cast members to pull their roles off in the film. Dark and mysterious, he was the best of the bunch. Eisenberg as Jimmy is as good. Easily likeable. Ricci does well with her role, and she looks great. And in the midst of everything, there's Chachi!. Scott Baio cameos. What?!, Donny Most ask for too much money?. And did anyone pick up that his publicist's name was Joanie?. Shannon Elizabeth, Mya, and ""Smallville""'s Michael Rosenbaum round out the rest of the ""Scream"" like list of potential victims. I never saw the theatrical version, so I don't know what this unrated version has the original didn't. There is a decently gruesome first death, but everything else pretty much plays it safe. This was trimmed down to PG-13 after all, so it could be accessible to as many people as possible. Does that make sense?. The ""Scream"" movies were R, and the first was a hard R, and those movies were blockbusters for their genre. People, and kids, will see it no matter what. The werewolf itself is half campy/half affective. Sometimes it looks cartoony, but then has a slight hint of menace. You wonder what the original R rated version of the script was like, and if the movie would of succeeded with it's intention of being ""Scream"" for the werewolf set. It's unfortunate because there is obviously a lot of potential here. A solid ground base, fun cast, cool premise, and incredible pedigree with Craven and Williamson. In the end, it's not all that bad at all, but it shows that it is the lighter, hollowed out version of something that was originally better. You can't put the blame on Craven or Williamson either, because it sounded like they had something in the beginning, but studio interference and other suggestions seemed to turn it into something else(Halloween 6, anyone?). The movie is light and fun, and is not the complete disaster it has been made out to be.

2284270,1,B0009ETCVA,"The latest film by Wes Craven is a major disappointment. My expectations were high but there was also a sense of fear due to the news that the first cut of the film had been scrapped because it wasn't scary and gory enough. The entire film was re-shot and this is the version currently showing at the cinema.

I've always had a soft spot for Werewolf movies - THE HOWLING, AN AMERICAN WEREWOLF IN LONDON, THE WOLF MAN - and was hoping that Kevin Williamson would bring some fresh bite to the myth and legend of this feral beast.

Sadly, right from the lazy fonts used for the opening credits, through to the art design and the creature effects, everything in this movie smacked of a Sunday afternoon BBC effort for kids. The fear and horror elements have been scrubbed clean from this film. It is totally anaemic and lacking in any punch.

The psychological tension and the perverse undercurrents that are usually employed in Werewolf movies were ditched in favour of cheap teenage comedy. Just compare the low budget effort of GINGER SNAPS to this and you'll see how far behind Craven is lagging in the race.

Christina Ricci was mediocre and sleepwalked through her one dimensional role. Even her transformation from a dour woman into a vamp was sloppy and the costume designer saw it fit to dress her in blacks and browns rather than signify the change in her sexual prowess by colour coding from black to glossy red. There seems to be no change in her character. Joshua Jackson, her boyfriend, was above average and with each passing day he's beginning to resemble Tony Curtis, albeit a more chunkier version. Mya, the soul singer, brought some vitality and her leopard costume was rather kinky. And remember Scott Baio from HAPPY DAYS? Well, he's in this mess too. You have been warned.

The script is beyond belief and the less said about it the better. Some of the dialogue, especially where the college bully comes out and announces he's gay, is ludicrous. The soundtrack, except for some original songs, was a melodramatic symphony of crash-bang-wallop sounds. Technically, the film is a disaster of old CGI and simple point-&-shoot angles. The puppet work and creature effects are not too bad but the overall effect is the brown stuff you see floating in the toilet. Yes, it's that bad.

It's not a completely terrible film, but neither is it an inspired nor memorable one.

When I saw the movie trailer and learned it was going to be PG-13, I was floored.  The creative team behind Scream 1 and 2 involved in a PG-13 horror movie? PLEASE NO!  I decided to wait until the unrated version of the movie came out on DVD instead of perpetuating the idea that there should be more watered-down horror movies.

What I saw wasn't bad, but more of a let-down.  The tension that was created in the first two Screams was gone, as was the clever dialogue.  It's a standard horror movie that probably would have done better at the box office if Wes Craven and Kevin Williamson's names weren't attached.  With their genuises put together, you're expecting a great movie that ""Cursed"" doesn't deliver.  It's not that the idea of the movie isn't great, but you can tell there was some major tinkering by the studio on how it could be more viewer-friendly to appeal to a mass audience.  The actors do the best they can with the material, though more should have been done with Portia di Rossi's psychic character and more fleshing out of Joshua Jackson's boyfriend character to give a greater emotional impact to the conclusion of the movie.

In the first two Scream movies, the funny parts helped throw off the audience as to keep them off-guard when the creepy parts jumped in.  With ""Cursed,"" the mixing isn't there.  Granted I did jump with the beginning introduction of Shannon Elizabeth's character being attacked and her gruesome final scene.  After that, it didn't really keep up the intensity.  Plus the inconsistencies in the plot knocked it off course.  One of the other characters in the movie doesn't know her friend just died even though it's been flashed all over the television?  Why do some characters turn into werewolves on a full moon but others who were infected don't?

It is more disappointing that there was a possibility of a great movie in ""Cursed.""  As far as what I saw in the unrated version, there weren't too many gory scenes that deemed to be trimmed to fit a PG-13 audience.  Off the top of my head, the beginning death scene and the final death scene were the only parts of the movie that felt R-rated.  There weren't any sex scenes.  There weren't any Scream-like torture scenes that resulted in death.  It just seemed that the studio wanted a ""Sixth Sense"" or ""The Ring"" size box office and felt the only way to achieve that type of monetary gain was to make it PG-13.  Wes Craven's resume should speak for itself and the next movie he makes should be left up to his creative control.  If you're looking for a movie that will scare you, but not linger in your mind for too long, try out the unrated version of ""Cursed.""  If you're a fan of horror movies, just check out one of Wes Craven's previous efforts.",1119312000,2,3012,4.550185873605948
2284276,3,B0009ETCVA,"I was excited about this movie when I first heard about it. It was Wes Craven and Kevin Williamson teaming up again after the Scream movies. The problem is though that they pretty much make it a Scream movie. I miss the Scream franchise but what worked for those movies doesn't work here. It's not the casts fault though because they're good. Williamson doesn't do his best writing here and Craven doesn't do his best direction either. Still though the movie could've been released for critics. I don't see where it's 100% bad. Worse movies have been released for critics.

  In the Scream movies when you find out who the killer is the killer goes on and on about why he did it. Here when you find out who the main wolf is you get the same thing. I killed so and so because of this or that. It doesn't work that great here. It would've been better if the excuse for killing was this and only this ""I was hungry"" and left at that. No though, Williamson loves to make his characters talk. It's hard to believe he's not gay because even his guy characters talk the way a girl would. I mean look at Dawson's Creek lol.

  The movie even has the look of a Scream movie. The house Christina Ricci lives in even looks like it's straight from the Scream set. Plus some scenes it's hard to tell what Wes or Williamson were trying to do. I mean there's a dream sequence of Ricci biting Joshua Jackson's neck. Then blood squirts all over and she wakes up. It doesn't even fit in the movie. The movie is a mess but can't say I didn't enjoy it. There is some tension in the movie and some stuff works. It's best described as an enjoyable B-movie. It could've been so much more though. The funnest scene is where Jesse Eisenbeg's dog turns in a werewolf and chases him through the house.

2284284,1,B0009ETCVA,"Seems to me that ever since Wes Craven went back to Elm Street with 1994's New Nightmare, that everything he has turned out since has been utter horror fodder, and don't even get me started on the Scream trilogy.  Those who are familiar with Craven's early and revered work, Last House on the Left, Hills Have Eyes, the original Nightmare on Elm Street, and Serpent and the Rainbow, won't believe just how generic and sloppy Cursed is.  Though the film has had a sordid production history, this reunion of Craven and Scream writer Kevin Williamson finds Christina Ricci in the starring role who, along with her brother, are both bitten by a werewolf.  Soon enough, every predictable thing happens, including some somewhat cool werewolf transformations, courtesy of the master himself, Rick Baker.  However, the directing is horrible, the dialogue attrocious, and besides Ricci, the cast is horrid.  Joshua Jackson, Shannon Elizabeth, Portia de Rossi, and just about everyone else involved are just plain bad, and by the time Cursed reaches it's unlikely climax, you'll be wishing you'd have done something better with your time.  This re-cut ""unrated"" (really R-rated as is what the film originally received, and then trimmed down for a PG-13 rating) version of the film really adds nothing besides some so-so gore effects.  It's a shame that Wes Craven has sunk so low, I never thought that the same guy who went for your jugular in Last House on the Left and Hills Have Eyes could turn out something as bad as this.",1114992000,36,1517,4.90234375

2284286,3,B0009ETCVA,"Having enjoyed Wes Craven and Kevin Williamson's first collaboration in Scream, I was hoping for Cursed to be just as exciting, fun and scary. I've been watching the progress of Cursed (which was supposed to have been released almost 2 years ago but went through countless changes, casting decisions, etc) and so wasn't expecting too much when I went in. Overall, the movie was good but not Wes Craven great.

But do not be fooled with this Unrated version!  I originally thought that maybe the theatrical cut was missing scenes or depth that would change my feelings about the movie.  However, I've read from a couple reliable sources that the unrated movie only adds about 1-2 minutes to the run time.  And those 1-2 minutes is probably a splash of blood here, a splash there.  I seriously doubt it will do much to change the film.  Therefore, if you are under the impression that the unrated version will be a million times better than the theatrical cut, I think you'll be disappointed.

It was also pretty interesting to see a modern take on the classic werewolf legend and wolf man movies. So, in that aspect it was interesting. Was it scary? Not really. There were a couple of classic jump out moments but I think I jumped maybe twice. It also, of course, wasn't bloody at all, but really does 2 minutes more gore really change much?

Also another problem, IMO, is that the movie keeps the standard horror movie cliches that Scream made fun of and twisted. Here you have characters doing stupid things, running upstairs when they shouldn't (or riding in an elevator, for instance), you have plenty of red herrings as to who is the ""master werewolf"" and you have the music cues (that seem ripped straight from Scream) to indicate that you should be scared right....now.

All of this aside, it was an entertaining movie. MUCH better than some recent horror movies (Alone in the Dark and Boogeyman, I'm looking at you). It just didn't get over that last bar. It fell short of being a 4 or so rating. However, if you like horror movies, like Wes Craven and really want to see a horror movie in the theatre, then I would definitely recommend this one over the current crap fest. It should entertain you in the way that Scream did, only not as well.  And if you enjoyed the movie in the theatre, then you would definitely want to pick this version up over the PG-13 one.

Yeah.  This movie was a great way to blow time off in the theater, and anyone who is a fan of Wes Craven or horror-comedies will get a kick out of this film.  It's not gonna be a classic like Nightmare On Elm Street or The Hills Have Eyes, but it's still fun...and the CGI werewolves are actually good!  There is one scene that has some bad CGI, and that's the dog.  And this movie is far from perfect.  You can tell what scenes were reshot sometimes, and which ones weren't.  And you could even tell where they dubbed over profanity in one scene.  So, I'm definately getting the Unrated version of this flick, where Shannon Elizabeth supposedly crawls on the ground to try to escape...and it's just the top half of her body.  So, overall, this is a fun, campy little horror flick that I'd reccomend to those who like 80's horror.

2284290,2,B0009ETCVA,"This is another collaboration between Kevin Williamson and Wes Craven, the same Dimension team that gave us the Scream trilogy.

In this film, Williamson and Craven try to put that Dimension Films twist on the werewolf genre franchise. The film is mildly amusing; however, it's not their best work.

The film stars Christina Ricci and Jesse Eisenberg as a sister and brother, who are surviving on their own. Ellie (Ricci) is a successful booking agent for the CBS Late Late Show with Craig Kilborn (shameless plug), who is also raising her teenage, dweeb brother, Jimmie (Eisenberg).

One night on their way home from work / school, their car is struck by an animal, which forces their car to collide with an oncoming vehicle. While their vehicle remained on the roadway, the second car careened down the embankment into the woods. Eager to assist in rescuing any survivors from the other vehicle, our two would-be heroes traverse the dark and eerie hillside.

As they approach the wreckage, the vehicle is upside-down. The passenger inside the wreckage is alive; however, she is pinned against her dashboard. As Jimmie proceeds to free our ensnared casualty, Ellie senses something approaching. In the film's only exciting scene, just as the female victim is freed, the driver's side window explodes. Both the victim and Jimmie are pulled out of the car, with Ellie in pursuit. What proceeds next is a set of flashing scenes, and a lot of snarling sound effects (please remember the film is PG-13, nothing too grotesque is allowed). After the montage of flashing sequences, both Ellie and Jimmie are tattered and torn, but relatively alright. Then out of nowhere, the half-eaten carcass of the female victim comes flying at them, and she is still moving..... but not for long.

The sad part is that all of this occurs in the first twenty minutes of the film, after which the film goes spiraling into infinitesimal ambiguity with who-cares-what-happens plots and sidebars. All of which culminates in a werewolf laden nightclub called Tinsel; however by then, you're just wishing for a quick and painless ending to a film whose running time is only 97 minutes, but feels twice that....

I have come to expect so much more from Williamson and Craven, and you should too. My suggestion is re-rent the Scream trilogy, they're far more entertaining.

If they do, will they be able to kill the ""Lead Werewolf"" who started everything, thereby setting themselves free?

""Cursed"", directed by Wes Craven and written by Kevin Williamson. is basically a remake of ""Scream 3"", with werewolves replacing the masked killer. Yes, ""Scream 3"", the least successful installment of their popular franchise. The filmmakers have created a movie with a couple of scary moments and an overly long finale. Good, better than most, but not good enough.

The actors are used like dolls by the filmmakers to map out the action. ""Scream"" was so strong, partially, because it took lesser known actors and TV stars and gave them roles they could have fun with. The roles didn't require much of a stretch and we had fun watching Neve Campbell and Courtney Cox run around. In ""Cursed"", the lead is played by Christina Ricci. Ricci is completely different from the other two performers. Ricci has starred in some great independent films and has already earned a name for herself. In ""Cursed"", she plays a character that is a victim, for most of the film, she has little else to do and her character is boring. The rest of the cast is about par for a film like this.

A film like this is only going to be as good as the writer and director. Craven manages to create two scenes that have some actual suspense. Is this enough for you? To satisfy me, these scenes would have to be [like] Janet Leigh ""Psycho"" Shower Scene or Drew Barrymore's beginning of ""Scream"" scary. Neither comes close to approaching that. The first scene, involving Shannon Elizabeth is missing a crucial element. Yes, she is in danger, but we don't know who she is, she's just another woman in danger. Because we don't identify with her, it's difficult to care about what happens to her. The second scene, involving the singer Mya, is more successful. Craven uses low camera angles and a couple of shots of a werewolf to create some real suspense. The rest of the film is pretty slow. Talk, talk, talk. A couple of brief moments when Ellie and Jimmy attempt to deal with the changes in their bodies are interesting, but tame.

Williamson, in particular, is not on his ""A Game"" with this film. He really misses the boat with the character of Jimmy. Because both Ellie and Jimmy are cut by the animal, they become infected and start changing. However, there is almost no relationship created between Jimmy's changes and the fact that he is a gawky teenager whose body would normally be changing. He gets stronger. That's about it. He also telegraphs virtually every scene before hand, robbing the film of a lot of suspense. A prolonged visit to Tinsel ensures that a major event will take place there. The nightclub is really an odd mishmash as well. The logo and the initial visit would lead us to believe that it would be the perfect place for a goth revival. Over subsequent visits, we see a Diva room, TV characters, a wax figure of Whoopi Goldberg. It just isn't consistent. Also, every character becomes a possibility for ""Lead Werewolf"". By the way, as soon as we know this fact, we know that someone will not be who they seem. And the fact that every character could be the ""Lead Werewolf"" will point most viewers to the identity of this character much sooner than the writer would probably like.

Also, once the villain identifies themselves, Williamson still attempts to throw suspicion on other characters. Not only is this completely useless, but it's sloppy and bad storytelling.

The cameos by Craig Killborn and Scott Baio inject a brief sense of wackiness into the proceedings. Both are abandoned and not carried through to their full potential. I get the sense that Kilborn had at least one more scene, but for some reason, it was cut out.

Williamson, who is openly gay, has created one of the most laughably stereotypical subplots in recent memory.

Craven does a serviceable job. The story, such as it is, is told in a quick, efficient manner. It seems like some scenes were edited out, or down. Craven has directed some of the most successful horror films of all time. I would guess that he has earned the right of final cut, at least for his horror films.

2284308,1,B0009ETCVA,"Well, Wes Craven has obviously turned his back on devoted horror fans in order to bank off of loser thirteen year olds.  I'm not just talking about the PG-13 rating, in fact I thought the film was bloody enough to get an R rating. Not because it was overly gory by any means, but just because the MPAA might look unfavoriably on any film by a man like Wes Craven.  Oh wait! That's right! he's sold out and is working for the same Nazis that run the whole hollywood riech!

I know what your thinking, ""another underground cult cinema gorehound is trashing  us common folk who like to dabble occasionaly in the genre of horror just for a cheap thrill.""  Well that's true, but even with that aside, this is just a terrible film.  The characters? who cares.  There are only about four that exist in the film for more than thirty minutes,  and you don't even care because the time that should haver been spent developing these characters is devoted to making use of enough computer generated effects too make you think your watching a 50 minute cartoon spliced into a film.  And wow, who would have thought that it was the boyfriend all along. I think Wes Craven deep down in his heart just wants to go direct episodes of Dawson's creek and The O.C.  This is just his transition period.",1111190400,,1281,4.459227467811159
2284309,5,B0009ETCVA,"REVIEW OF CURSED UNRATED:
June 25:
I enjoyed the Theatrical release of this film; not great, but entertaining. CURSED unrated is the only way to see the film, since it shows some very cool scenes which are great popcorn shots. The audio is consistently great. There is a very tantalizing start. The accident scene has some major fun ""pops"".
The Dream Blood is totally surreal. The Elevator audio is just very appropriate ( Mya's demise).
In sum, the Key Scenes are much more graphic, and the original intent is there in the unrated version.
THE EXTRAS:
EDITING 101: Explains the version differences, technical and the why in studio terms.
The ""Documentary"" BECOMING  A WEREWOLF is just plain silly, and has a very cute ending that I think portrays the comedic tone of the film CURSED ( However bad the ""Mockumentary""  is ).
The Commentary of 4 Selected scenes is sort of interesting but not altogether entertaining; although it is a bit revealing that certain components  that the commentators find risible are indicative of the feeling around some of the production mess that is supposed to have surrounded this film.
OVERALL:  not enough extras. I suspect that a whole host of material on the cutting room floor could have been used to show more of the films creation.
Basically a fun film ... with a basically popcorn tone.

***************************
Despite what has been said about the ""cursed""  production history, this film has surfaced as quite a good watch. I can't wait to see it out in DVD, where they will hopefully  have a very good R  rated ( or Unrated) version of the film.
Rick Baker has talked previously about combining his traditional makeup work with  CGI , and it seems like he has more than succeeded. Hopefully he will get the chance to do some more were-wolf  work where his artistry will stand up to some powerful scrutiny.
It has been amazing that almost every critically slammed  film comes out as top 3-4, and invariable top ten for some time.
It is almost like the critics have an inverse appreciation of what people like.
Anyways, Christina Ricci is great. I last saw her do some decent horror work in BLESS THE CHILD, alongside the ever fabulous Kim Basinger. Whilst CURSED does not have the panache that BLESS THE CHILD  does, it is fun, entertaining, and a very good  genre film.",1111017600,4,2315,4.7575
2284310,1,B0009ETCVA,"Ok...anyone who liked this movie is clearly under the age of 13. This movie was NOT scary, NOT entertaining and had really stupid puns. Ms. Ricci cant act worth a dime, and the kid that plays her bro in the movie, I have never seen act anywhere else but he acts a lot better than her. Too bad it was for such a stupid movie.

I really wanted to see ""Cursed"", the day it came out, but didn't get there until its third day.  I thought it had potential...Seeing as I like Wes Craven movies (own the ""Scream"" trilogy), and there are a LOT of actors, in it, who I like!  But, werewolf movies have never really been my 'thing'.  But, from what I saw, on the previews, it looked REALLY good...And, sure enough, it WAS!!!

  I'm SO sick of people bashing good movies...If it's not your thing, it's not your thing.  But, ""Cursed"" was a GREAT movie!!!

  It wasn't too scary, or gorey...And, didn't have anything excessively inappropriate...So, it was able to have a PG-13 rating.  But, that doesn't make it any less of a horror movie.  I think everything was done, just to the right degree, with it.

  ""Cursed"" is an AMAZING movie!!!  It is immensely well-acted, tremendously interesting, and rivotting!!!  If you haven't gotten to see it, yet...Get out there, QUICK!!!...Because, it's almost gone from theaters, after being out, for only 2 weeks.  :-(  If you don't get to catch it, get it, as soon as it comes out, on video!!!  It's hauntingly wonderful!!!  :-)

2284313,3,B0009ETCVA,"A pretty good werewolve movie. Not the best by any stretch, even Underworld is better than this, and that movie isn't the greatest either. Wes Craven handled the film pretty well for what its worth, and got some pretty juicy parts and some cheap scares. I can't wait for the R rated version to come out, it seems as though all the R horror movies now are being butchured into PG-13 ratings to increase the audience. This movie however was jam packed and pushed PG-13 to the limits. There was nudity in this movie, which really bugs me because i don't see how nudity in a horror movie is going to scare you, its pointless. The gore and violence wasn't as strong as I'm sure the R version will be, but there was still enough to satisfy. In the violence department a man's head is cut off, a werewolve is shot repeatedly with lots of blood spraying out, someone gets shot in the head and we than see the brain matter on the floor, a girl is ripped apart, someone is stabbed in the chest, a guy bursts into flames, and whenever any werewolves touch metal their skin starts to burn. Its okay, but not the best. All the gore though was pretty quick, but if your a huge Wes Craven fan like I am, i think you'll appriciate the movie a lot more than if you werent.",1110326400,,1255,4.277310924369748
2284334,1,B0009ETCVA,"I am quickly losing my faith in the intelligence of US moviegoers & more specifically, horror fans. I saw ""Cursed"" in theaters today and saw one of the more poorly executed attempts at mainstream horror. I have read many articles about this troubled production (2 reshoots, many cast changes) and hoped Wes Craven could have pulled this one out of the water. ""Cursed"" suffers from lack of imagination in regards to the subject matter (werewolves), HORRENDOUS acting (Shannon Elizabeth, Mya, & Joshua Jackson), failure to tap into Christina Ricci's gifts as an actress and goth personality, long stretches of scene chewing so-called ""character development"" and, as usual, lack of gore in a PG-13 movie. The problems start right from the beginning with the fortune teller (Portia De Rossi) and two girls we couldn't give a spit about. Shannon Elizabeth & Mya truly cannot act and De Rossi wasn't much better in a scene that looks like it was done in one quick take. Later, Elizabeth's character runs into Ricci and her brother and all 3 are attacked by a mysterious creature (gee, I wonder what that could be?) ending, thankfully in Elizabeth's death. For what seems like forever after, we endure the most boring stretch of cinema, complete with inconsequential dialogue. We learn Ricci's character works on the Craig Kilborn show as an executive and her younger brother is a geek in high school (how original). We also have to eudure the usual celebrity cameos (Scott Baio?) the office bitch (Judy Greer) and a museum of horror exhibit with JOSHUA JACKSON  as its architect?!? Why does anyone bother to cast this no-talent in their movies? Oh wait, Kevin Williamson wrote ""Cursed"" so naturally he'd have to find a job for one of his out of work ""Dawson's Creek"" cronies. Never mind that Jackson has no big screen presence and his chemistry with Ricci (as the movie's couple) was zero. I also felt Ricci's on screen brother was essentially unnecessary.

Wes Craven also made a dire mistake by not utilizing Christina Ricci's offbeat charm and sexuality. He has her play it straight and really missed out on an opportunity to maximize the movie's potential with a role seemingly tailored made for her.

By the time we get to the big battle (that takes place inside the horror exhibit, you know it had to) we couldn't care less about who the werewolf turns out to be. And the answer is no surprise either.

Maybe Wes Craven should ditch Williamson and find a new writer who can write something ORIGINAL.

At least this movie put me in the mood for werewolves. So now if you'll excuse me I'll go watch another another lychanthrope movie with infected siblings at its core, a little treasure called GINGER SNAPS.",1110067200,13,2706,4.83585313174946
2284335,4,B0009ETCVA,"this movie was a lot better than what i feared considering the PG-13 rating.  it follows the story of a sister and brother who are in a (memorable and terrifying) car accident with another car and while they're trying to help the young woman get out of overturned car they all meet a werewolf.  wes craven delivers and i really thought the movie was cool and scary and watch for the ""bathroom stall"" scene that was freaky also.  lots of chills and fast paced humour it was a fun time at the theater.",1109980800,3,499,4.344086021505376
2284336,5,B0009ETCVA,"This isn't some amazing film that will make my top 10 at the end of the year, but it is sure to be one of the most fun times I'll have at the theater all year. It was an absolute blast for what it's worth! Yes, the CGI sucks and there are things to nitpick about, but it has a nice amount of jump scares and couldn't be more entertaining. I saw it in a packed audience opening night and there were plenty of laughs and screams. I didn't hear anything negative on the way out. I was afraid I'd be highly disappointed by this movie, but all of the negative things lowered my expectations and lead to me being very pleasantly surprised.

I had so dang much fun at this movie! It works great as popcorn entertainment. It deserves to do much better than the other horror crap that was released this year. Too bad this one wouldn't have gotten released sooner before everyone was sick of so many horror movies (a new one was released almost every week), leading to this one not doing as well. If it would have come out sooner it could have done quite a bit better. It's a shame because it's a blast and I'd kill for a sequel. I wish they'd do one anyway. I know Wes Craven wouldn't be back to direct but I don't care as long as Kevin Williamson returns to write.

Grade: 8/10 (A-) ----- I normally wouldn't give this high of a rating to something that works as great popcorn entertainment, but it's a personal recent favorite of mine. It's not Million Dollar Baby, but if you're looking for more of a ""fun"" movie then this is definitely satisfying in that area. It was fun and funny. See it with a group of people. The more the merrier. A movie like this is best with a bunch of people. It's way more fun that way. At least try to go when it would be busiest so you can see it with a good amount of people in attendance. Friday night and Saturday night would likely be best.

It's no SCREAM, that's for sure, but it works on its own. It's the best horror movie I've seen in theaters in awhile. I went to SAW opening weekend because it was Halloween weekend and I wanted to see a horror flick, and I didn't think it was that great at all. It's one of the most overrated movies of 2004. The acting was atrocious by the leads! Plus the movie was just cheesy. It does work as something to laugh at though because the bad acting and cheesy stuff make it quite hilarious. Then the following weekend I sat through THE GRUDGE which was even worse. It was so boring and pointless. It wasn't involving in the least, unlike the movie it couldn't resemble more - THE RING. Now that one was highly engrossing, hypnotic, and creepy - with a mystery that was actually interesting.

THE GRUDGE was just lame and is also overrated. I'd give SAW a 6/10 (C+) and THE GRUDGE a 5/10 (C). I'd highly recommend CURSED over those two.

I plan on seeing it again in theaters. I want to support it and plus I'd just love to see it again. It's too fun! I plan on buying the DVD the day it hits stores for sure. Hopefully it's extras packed...",1109894400,5,3009,4.217013888888889
2284337,2,B0009ETCVA,"Siblings Ellie (Ricci) and Jimmy (Eisenberg) are hit a big furry something while driving and end up in an even bigger accident, rammin another car and sending it off the road and down a hillside.  While trying to save the driver of that car, they are both bitten by a wolf.  Jimmy comes to believe it is a warewolf, while Ellie harbors doubts.  Soon, supernatural powers begin to present themselves.  Jimmy likes what they do for him, Ellie becomes worried.  Soon, they are searching for the ""wolf"" that bit them in an attempt to end the curse.

There are a number of things hurt this movie.  The first is the cast.  A virtual who's who of young Hollywood, the case of ""Cursed"" exists only to draw in teens to the theater.  The only real quality actor name-wise in this movie is Christina Ricci, the lead.  Unfortunately, her performance shows none of the quality that she has produced before.  She seems like she is on auto pilot.  Scott Baio, of all people, gets credit for playing a disperaging version of himself, and showing that he can take a joke at his own expense.

Director Wes Craven and writer Kevin Williamson have distanced themselves from the movie.  They made the ""Scream"" franchise work, and revived interest in horror movies, and for some reason the studio decided that they wanted a PG-13 rating.  The studio forced the cuts without Craven and Williamson's input, and it shows.  The choppy editing of the kills and obvious desire not to show too much are painfully obvious.

Finally, the PG-13 rating will be the death of horror movies as we have known them.  Why any studio would trim a horror movie that was filmed for an R rating down to a PG-13 is beyond me.  Why they would do this to a Wes Craven moven movie is even more puzzling.  This is a clear case of trying to get teens into the theaters, and it is insulting to any fan of the horror genre.

That being said, this movie would still have been bad with the gore.  It just does not work on so many levels that a little blood and guts would make absolutely no difference.  This movie was a disappointing experience that I would not recommend partaking in.",1109721600,3,2133,4.511749347258486
2284338,2,B0009ETCVA,"At first, I thought this was going to be the Werewolf equivalent to ""The Lost Boys.""  There are opening shots of a carnival, one of the main characters is a misfit in high school, the opportunity was just there.  OK, so the only movie that comes close to being the Werewolf equivalent of ""Lost Boys"" is ""An American Werewolf in London.""

That initial disappointment out of the way, this movie followed a fairly standard formula of the characters being bitten, then going through changes, before having to defeat the progenitor of their line in order to regain their humanity.  *Yawn*

This movie gets an additional star because of certain memorable scenes.  One is where two characters come out to each other:  ""I'm gay.""  ""Nothing wrong with that, but I'm a werewolf.""  The character of the high school bully is also very refreshing, ending up being a quite likeable character at the end.

I would say, go see this for Christina.  She is mostly wasted on the movie, but it's fun to watch her uncharacteristically good looks.  Also, the identity of the progenitor werewolf is REALLY obvious.",1109721600,,1091,4.806451612903226

2284342,3,B0009ETCVA,"Never in my time would I have thought that I'd see a horror film by Wes Craven that was PG-13, but with the success of PG-13 horror movies such as The Ring and The Grudge, it's no wonder that Dimension pushed for a PG-13 rating for Cursed. And I'm sure (no doubt) that Wes Craven orginally filmed Cursed as an R movie, so hopefully we will see an unrated director's cut on DVD later this year.

Moving on, Cursed is a film brought to you by the creators of the Scream trilogy, writer Kevin Williamson (who also did the Faculty) and director Wes Craven (mostly known for the original Nightmare of Elm St.) Aside from being PG-13 and lacking the edge that most Wes Craven films have as far as violence go, Cursed is a pretty good horror flick. I just thought the toning-down of blood and gore in the film was enough to drop it a half star. THIS FILM REALLY NEEDED MORE BLOOD IN IT to make it much more effective and more of a valid horror movie, considering Craven's past films.

Other than that the plot was well executed, Wes Craven's strong sense of direction and storytelling was definitely there, and the acting is what you'd expect from this sort of movie. Would've been a total winner if the studio hadn't squandered the more violent parts in an asinine attempt at making the film more appealing to a wider and younger audience.",1109376000,,1333,4.436734693877551

2284344,1,B0009ETCVA,"Damn, it's such a shame. With horror-master Wes Craven at the helm, Kevin Williamson (""Scream"", ""Dawson's Creek"") writing the script, and quirky, sexy Christina Ricci starring in a movie about werewolves in L.A., all the right ingredients were there for a clever, scary, and fun thrill-ride.

What the hell happened?

The supposed story is, ""Cursed"" was actually filmed two years ago, and the studio wasn't happy with it, so they were forced to re-write and re-shoot half the film. Then the studio decided to alter the film yet again, when they decided to go for a ""PG-13"" rating instead of an ""R"". The result is that the film that finally made it to the theaters is an absolute quilt of a film, patched together from multiple scripts and storylines. (If you were wondering why half of the scenes feature Christina Ricci with her real hair and half of the scenes feature her wearing a bad wig, that's the answer.) The story is uneven at best, the special affects are cheesy, and the film fails at being either scary or funny. All in all, it's pretty pathetic.

Maybe, if we're lucky, we'll get to see a ""Director's Cut"" of this film on DVD, and see what Wes Craven really had in mind for this film. Because the version I saw in the theater was nothing but a neutered mess.",1109376000,,1272,4.5701754385964914

Now then, and this might give away more than the reader might want to know.  (So stop now.  Although, this is not the end of Milllion Dollar Baby)

The writers left this reviewer expecting to see the fascinating (looking) Christina Ricci and her character's brother turn into Warewoolves, compleetely.  But, no such luck.  This hole in the script ruins the whole movie.  You cannot set up something like this and not deliver.

The good news:  If you are in the business - whether film or Television - there are plenty of sight gags and lines that are very funny.  That, and the fact that they shot this in my neighborhood, made it a lot more interesting than it might be to someone between the coasts.

The acting.  Ricci is, well, horrible.  She gradually reverts to Wednesday, both in look and attitude.  The actor who is most memorable is the ""bony butt P.R. character who steals the movie.

See it if you are into the genre, if not, please don't see it and trash it.  It is much better than Bogeyman and almost as good as Constantine.

2284346,4,B0009ETCVA,"I expected ""Cursed"" to be mildly entertaining, but nothing special due to the re-shooting of the film because the first script was so bad. Wes Craven is considered the master of horror, but to me his only film close to ""greatness"" is the original ""A Nightmare on Elm Street."" John Carpenter in the late 70's and early 80's made much better and more memorable horror films that have stood the test of time. He is the master to me. I have always been a fan of werewolf flicks and while this one was entertaining it can't stand up against ""American Werewolf in London,"" but it is still better than most in this genre. The werewolf looked pretty good and I was happy to see that CGI wasn't used very often. The acting, dialogue, and PG-13 rating were the things that hurt the film. It was more the dialogue than the actors I believe. The guy from Dawson's Creek wasn't too bad (I thought I would never say such a thing) and Christina Ricci was good even though the dialogue wasn't up to what she deserves.

Soon both realize that something is not right as they begin to exhibit the signs of a human who has bitten by a werewolf.

There are twists and turns and Craven makes you think the villian is one person or the next.  The other actors (Joshua Jackson plays Ricci's love interest) have fun with their roles.  There are also funny cameos by Scott Baio and Craig Kilborn.
