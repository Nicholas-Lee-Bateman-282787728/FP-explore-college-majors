200950,5,1603584803,"My husband and I are thinking about getting bees and we've been particularly looking in to top bar hives. We might get a little less honey but it's supposed to be better for the bees.
This DVD was a wealth of information on everything from gathering honey to splitting hives. We will definitely be watching it again, as we get closer to getting our bees and after as well. We plan on getting the book as well. Highly recommended.",1396310400,4,429,4.443037974683544
200951,5,1603584803,"Wonderfully straightforward treatise on top-bar hives, their construction, maintenance & on beekeeping itself.  Top-bar hives produce perhaps 20% less honey than Langstroth hives, but they are far less expensive to build, require less maintenance, far less storage space (there is no need for extra supers and frames) and they do not require the heavy lifting necessary to the care of conventional hives.
If you are considering beekeeping, do yourself a favor, and see this DVD or read the book of the same name before committing to either type of beehive.  You'll be glad you did; whatever choice you make, it will be better informed.  If you have bees in Langstroth hives, but find their care harder to maintain than you'd like or can physically manage, Mr. Crowder's top-bars may be just exactly the solution you need.",1395964800,6,821,5.022058823529412
200952,5,1603584803,"This helped to show the hands on aspect of top bar beekeeping.  If anyone is debating on starting a top bar hive, then this DVD will give you the knowledge & skills needed, along with the book. I highly recommend it.",1388534400,7,216,4.2682926829268295
200953,5,1603584803,"Les shows how letting the bees live the way they want to produces a little less net honey to harvest - and a lot more clean, un-contaminated beeswax, which is also a salable product!
Let's quit stressing and grossing out these sweet little creatures!",1387238400,4,250,4.704545454545454

200956,5,1603584803,Great source of knowledge for the beginning top bar beekeeper. Can't wait to get my bees and start the process. I know I'll be more successful due to this book!,1428537600,,160,4.366666666666666
200957,5,1603584803,Very informative.  Will be putting the info into practice.  Thanks for a great book.,1428278400,,84,4.928571428571429

200962,5,1603584803,"Each time I watch this video I learn more about top bar beekeeping. His guidance is invaluable, his delivery straight from the heart. I recommend this DVD and book of the same title to all beeks - Top Bar, Lang, Warre, Whatever method you choose, you will garner tips about all facets of beekeeping from this DVD.",1414800000,4,313,4.508771929824562

200964,5,1603584803,"This is a great guide for the beginning top bar bee keeper. Better diagrams than in The Thinking Beekeeper, which is similar. Very similar philosophy to beekeeping in both. I got the video too, which was interesting, but probably not necessary, given all the great stuff on YouTube...",1401235200,3,284,4.9375
200965,4,1603584803,"If you are a visual learner, this DVD will help clarify some of the topics covered in the book.  The book is excellent, and if you only choose one, I would recommend the book as a more comprehensive resource.",1400198400,3,208,4.333333333333333
7800185,5,1603584803,"Excellent book by Les Crowder for top bar beehive people/bees.  He explains all aspects of top bar beehives and even includes plans for building one!  I used his specifications and very am satisfied.  Later, I purchased the DVD by him.  He's a cool and kind person!",1521158400,,265,4.695652173913044

7800187,2,1603584803,Lots of preaching of an unproven method of beekeeping. Lots of claims with no scientific basis to back any thing up.,1495065600,,116,4.571428571428571
7800188,5,1603584803,"This is far from a covering every aspect of top bar bee keeping, but as new beekeeper it gave me the information I needed to get started with confidence.  I started out with the Top-Bar Beekeeping book by the same author.  After reading the book and getting my hive, I still had some questions about actually manipulating the bars and getting them back in without smashing bees that always want to climb out of the open space left between the bars.  Seeing the technique explained and demonstrated was worth the cost of the video even if no other information had been included.  Overall, the video was a great addition to the book.  Reading about something is great, but actually seeing it done is even better.  If you are going to get into top-bar beekeeping, I highly recommend getting both as the video doesn't cover many of the things the book covers and reading about how to do something is no substitute to seeing it done.",1493510400,,928,4.593939393939394

7800190,3,1603584803,"This video is more of a pitch for the off-the-grid, organic way of doing things than a how-to video. The only thing he explains in detail in this video is how to rotate the bars to give the bees more room to build maximum honey per square inch. The rest is your guess. I am about a month away from being set up with my first hives and so have been looking at the how-to's of Langstroth vs. top-bar hiving. I have read several books on the methods of beekeeping, including top bar, Langstroth, the new Flow-Hive technology, and even how to build a hollow log hive with removable combs out f an old tree. Top-Bar Beekeeping by Les Crowder and Heather Harrell. I found the book to be just excellent, very detailed and with very good photos. I felt like I could go out and build a top-bar hive and rotate the combs front to back and build divides after reading it. On the other hand, I didn't find this video very helpful. He doesn't show you how to recognize capped brood vs larvae, capped pollen from capped honey, uncapped honey from capped, propolis, bur combing from production combing. He talks about breakage of the comb from the bar, mentions that a particular comb has been repaired, but says nothing about what to do when you accidentally break one. The book, on the other hand, does. The book covered all the information in this video in much better detail. He does not explain how to build a hive. He does not actually show you an empty hive box. He does show you how to rig a cheap wax melter--if you want to use a genuinely nasty bathtub lying in the yard with an old window or door thrown across the top--but again he does not show you how to melt it, and I couldn't put that process together in my mind or go out and do it myself after watching the video. Save your money and buy the book. You will be able to build, care for, and harvest queens, honey, and beeswax, melt it and plant good forage plants after reading the book.",1464307200,4,1939,4.315068493150685
