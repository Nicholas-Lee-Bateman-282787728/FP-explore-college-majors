5905485,1,B00EE5BWTU,"I purchased this for a Christmas gift.  The description does not state that one of the two DVD's are rated for B & C rated DVD players only.
I am disappointed in the seller of these DVD's that are only rated for certain DVD players. I see that a new warning has been added to the item, after I purchased it.",1464912000,,307,4.032786885245901

5905487,1,B00EE5BWTU,This is a combo pack so you would think both would be able to be played in the same blu ray player.. Nope. ! One was compatible and one was not. No external markings describe that either had to return,1456012800,,200,4.025

5905489,3,B00EE5BWTU,"Warning: If you live in the States, these Blu-Rays may not play in your machine.  The price is also insanely high.

Unless you absolutely need a Region B/2 version, which per Amazon is for Europe, Greenland, French territories, Middle East, Africa, Australia and New Zealand, order the two separate discs instead.
