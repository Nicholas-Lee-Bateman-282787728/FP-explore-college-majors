3421258,3,B0018TNAIQ,"Poor Basil Rathbone, I hope he was paid well for appearing in a subpar sci-fi flick that feels as though it was pieced together from several sources (which it was).  I was only interested in it because of Basil and he was relegated to a few scenes shot on a set that looked like it was made from cardboard boxes covered in tin foil.  How ignominious.

The story was fairly routine, a quick exploration of Venus.  Five men and a robot descend to the surface and wander around killing lizard thingies and collecting samples including blood from the tail of a dinosaur-looking creature.  It all takes place in 2020.  I kept thinking, so this is what passes for the future.  Then explain Faith Domergue's hairdo!  The poor woman was stuck in orbit while the manly men got to explore.  All she got to do was calmly chat on the radio, not a hair out of place.

I will say there was a couple of stunning shots that had to be a fluke or a mistake because the rest of the film was run of the mill.  Maybe they were left over from the original source material and someone had the great good sense to include them here.  Otherwise, eh, it's been done before and a whole lot better than this, Basil Rathbone notwithstanding.",1431820800,,1212,4.385650224215246

3421269,2,B0018TNAIQ,"Disclaimer: The version of this film that I viewed is contained in the Sci-Fi Classics 50 Movie Pack produced by Mill Creek Entertainment. As such, I cannot comment on the audio or visual quality of the disc released by Alpha Video. My review is concerned with the entertainment value of the film only.

Mill Creek Sci-Fi Classics 50 Movie Pack: Disc 2, Side B, first feature - VOYAGE TO THE PREHISTORIC PLANET (1965), starring Basil Rathbone and Faith Domergue, directed by Curtis Harrington.

In the year 2020, the earth is prepared to explore the surface of Venus, and three ships are dispatched for the mission.  One is destroyed by a meteor, but the others bravely plow forward, sending two men and a robot to the surface of the planet while the third member of the ship (Faith Domergue) remains aboard to monitor their progress.  The last ship hovers nearby - that is until disaster strikes the landing team, and the crew of the third ship decide to attempt a rescue.  What they find on the planet's surface is weird and bizarre, although there may also be elements that are far more familiar than they ever dreamed.

Peel this one back far enough, and you'll see the hand of Roger Corman again, though other than some fancy splicing techniques, I wouldn't really consider this a Corman film.  Several other reviewers have already mentioned that this is actually footage from a Soviet film called&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Planet-Of-Storms-Planeta-Bur/dp/B0058OTM4S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Planet Of Storms (Planeta Bur)</a>, with spliced-in footage of Faith Domergue as the woman left to monitor the first landing team, and who is also to keep in contact with the control elements back on the Earth's moon, headed up by none other than Sherlock Holmes...I mean Basil Rathbone.  The combined screen time of Rathbone and Domergue is probably about 10 minutes - the rest is the dubbed in Soviet actors on the surface of Venus.

This film has a lot of camp value, from the miniature sets of rockets in space, to the space suits and surface vehicle, to the prehistoric creatures the cosmonauts find on the planet.  Still, for all its naivet, there are elements which indicate a serious approach to the intricacies involved in getting to Venus; the refueling platform in space was, I thought, an interesting detail.  The lizard-men who attack the first landing team upon arrival, though, are absolutely absurd.  I might almost say that it's worth watching this film just for those five minutes.

The film PLANETA BUR gets generally high marks both here on Amazon as well as IMDb - that may well be the film a person should see if they are looking for early science-fiction out of the Hollywood mode.  Even hidden as it is within VOYAGE TO THE PREHISTORIC PLANET, we can see some of the cultural differences, but it's chopped up to the point that any charm PLANETA BUR might have is almost unrecognizable.  Unfortunately, after having seen VOYAGE, as well as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Voyage-to-the-Planet-of-Prehistoric-Women/dp/B002XMFI5K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Voyage to the Planet of Prehistoric Women</a>&nbsp;(another film that uses this same soviet footage to essentially tell an identical story), I don't see myself running out anytime soon to see this same footage a third time.  But even sight unseen, I can tell you that you won't be missing a thing if you skip voyaging to the prehistoric planet, or to the planet of prehistoric women, and try to see the planet of storms instead.",1393718400,,3597,5.2404181184668985
3421270,2,B0018TNAIQ,The image quality is extremely poor. The actors seem to help the puppets (that are supposed to be terrifying monsters) to eat them. There is a nice - maybe too long though-  scene with a cool floating car (long time before Star Wars; it floats over water instead then over a desert... ). There are some interesting ideas here and there with the robot in particular that is used as a winch rotating on itself. Some interesting shots are filmed intelligently outside. It is hard to say if it is the aging factor of the film or if the director used interesting filters but the yellowish aspect renders well the atmospheric ambiance of the planet Venus. I read on Wikipedia that it was originally a soviet film that was re edited by an American director. The shot with some strange mermaids was added in this new editing and looks very cheesy. I wish that the DVD would have incorporated the film in its original version as well.,1383782400,,925,4.538922155688622
3421271,2,B0018TNAIQ,"THIS is advertised as a widescreen 16:9, it is NOT, it is 1.33:1 (4:3).  Quality is fair but not woth $14.95.",1380585600,,109,4.190476190476191
3421272,1,B0018TNAIQ,"""Voyage to the Prehistoric Planet"" is something as strange as an American remake of a Soviet science fiction film. A few scenes with English-speaking actors have been added to what is essentially a dubbed version of the Russian original.

The plot revolves around a group of astronauts and their robot, investigating the planet Venus. As usual in films of this kind, the alien world turns out to be pretty similar to Earth during the Age of the Dinosaurs. The explorers run into a Brontosaurus, a Stegosaurus, a pterosaur and even a somewhat anachronistic Dimetrodon. They are also attacked by a kind of lizard-men, but these too are really dumb animals. Only at the very end do the astronauts realize that Venus is inhabited by intelligent, human-like creatures.

""Voyage to the Prehistoric Planet"" is boring, dragging and not very interesting. The producer, Roger Corman, must have realized this. Three years later, he was involved in a second remake, ""Voyage to the Planet of Prehistoric Women"", in which we finally get to meet the mysterious Venusian aliens, who turn out to be telepathic females!

Despite being substandard, ""Voyage to the Prehistoric Planet"" must have been popular in its day. I remember several scenes from this film from my childhood, despite never seeing the film itself. Presumably, I saw them in books about *real* astronomy.

Unfortunately, however, this long-winding exploration of tropical dinosaur haunts only deserves one star. Still, it's good to know that B-movies were made on both sides of the Iron Curtain...",1377302400,,1546,5.147410358565737

3421274,2,B0018TNAIQ,"I purchased the DVD because several stars appeared in the films. I'd never seen either of them before, and now I know I didn't miss anything. The scripts were amateurish and ridiculous, the special effects appeared to be done by kindergarteners, and the stars couldn't improve on either the script or the stories. Most of the actors were wooden and seemed embarrassed about their appearance in these deplorable movies. I don't think I've ever been so disappointed in a pair of films before. Do yourself a favor--forget you ever heard of these movies.",1373328000,,550,4.924731182795699

3421276,3,B0018TNAIQ,"Travel to Venus with a bunch of scientific-looking guys and an impressive robot that thinks of itself first.  Why travel to Venus?  Answer:  To look for intelligent life, because it apparently does not exist on Earth.

There are reasonably good special effects as the intrepid voyagers head off to Venus to rescue those daring young men in their landing machine that accidentally crashed on Venus because that was how they set up the plot of the story.  I hope all that is clear.  This movie started life as a Soviet science fiction film (which the Soviet government may have palmed off as a documentary, for all we know).  Roger Corman became the executive producer of the English version, and he spliced in scenes of Faith Domergue (who has appeared in numerous B-science fiction flicks) as Dr. Marsha (Marsha, Marsha, Marsha) Evans and Basil Rathbone (in one of his last films, a sad end for the man who is often identified as Sherlock Holmes) as Professor Hartman.  Corman cleverly has Evans and Hartman in different locations, both communicating with the men on Venus, thus keeping everyone from knowing that these shots were added to someone else's film to make a completely different movie.

The shots of Faith Domergue and Basil Rathbone were unnecessary and distracting.  The best shots are on Venus, as the men are attacked by guys in rubber Godzilla suits, only people-sized instead of king-sized, a tentacled plant, and a flying reptile that looks suspiciously like the bird in ""The Giant Claw.""  There are obligatory tense moments involving the poisonous atmosphere of Venus, earthquakes (or is that Venusquakes?), lava, and a flood.  How fortunate that it was not blizzard season!

In spite of the somewhat vague plot and the inability of people to find each other so that they could be rescued, this movie has a couple of bright spots, those being a robot and a ""space car"" (their terminology, not mine).  The robot is one of the most impressive robots I have seen, ranking with Robbie the Robot and the robot from ""Lost in Space.""  The space car looks like it could have been in ""Fireball XL5"" or ""Thunderbirds,"" and also adds a bright spot to this movie.

The plot drags in places, the sound is weak, the scenes with Domergue and Rathbone were unnecessary, and the attack from the water that I kept expecting never arrived.  Yet, I somehow managed to enjoy this movie.  I think it was because the Venus scenes had some charm to them.  I will only recommend this movie to hardcore science fiction film fans, or to fans of Roger Corman; everyone else may want move on to something else.

A tantalizing tidbit:  There is a sequel to this movie titled ""Voyage to the Planet of Prehistoric Women,"" which features Mamie Van Doren.  It seems that while the men in this movie were wandering around trying to rescue their comrades, there were a bunch of hot babes wandering around looking for the men.  What a meeting that would have been!

Good luck!",1339718400,,2959,4.768172888015717
3421277,2,B0018TNAIQ,"Take a behind-the-times Russian science fiction picture and dub it, toss in cheap Americanized cut scenes, shoot an unbearably plodding script, have no plot to speak of, and don't spend anything but bare-bones funding on the special effects, and that's VOYAGE TO THE PREHISTORIC PLANET.

Besides being bored, I was quite saddened to see a truly great actor like Basil ('Sherlock Holmes') Rathbone attached to this abomination of a film, even if only peripherally (probably for his name recognition). Like Bela Lugosi had to resign himself to appear in several Ed Wood pictures just before his death, Rathbone must have been quite desperate financially to accept such a humiliating role here. And I didn't even recognize Faith Domergue; maybe she wanted it that way.

The air car and robot are kinda cool, and the dubbed lines aren't all that bad amdist the usually preposterous dialogue. But overall, this film is just ridiculous on so many levels, it's basically a joke to watch. This feature would have been an Ed Wood masterpiece, but for everyone else it is nothing short of abyssmal.

I didn't hate this movie - after all, some schlock is expected in such a low-budget, sci-fi production - but then again I can't think of a single redeeming aspect to recommend about it. As one of the astronauts relates near the picture's end, this is just a mess.",1333238400,,1353,4.873913043478261
3421278,1,B0018TNAIQ,"Watch about 15 minutes of this and you'll realize that something's terribly wrong.  Yes, Basil Rathbone is in it, but he seems quite marginalized and does not really have a leading role as you'd expect.  As far as I can tell he is only in it for the name recognition.

Soon you start to see the scenes of astronauts approaching venus and.... Whoa!  Aren't these actors dubbed?  Yes they are, and very badly at that!  It turns out that the film was spliced together from mostly Soviet footage.  Not only are they badly dubbed, but it seems like maybe the director just asked a bunch of his out-of-work friends to do the dubbing.  It has all the dramatic effect of someone reading ""Run Spot Run"".

Surely things will pick up once they reach the planet?  Well they do -sort of.  No sooner are they out the door when one of the astro-- oops cosmonauts gets attacked by none other than a giant Venus fly trap.  Yes, a Venus fly trap.  Who would have guessed you'd actually find them on Venus!

The astro, I mean cosmonauts, seem generally unsurprised to find prehistoric life existing on the planet.  When they see that there are dangers galore, do they alter their plans?  Have a meeting to decide what to do?  No, they just plough on ahead with a devil-may-care attitude.  Hey if they are in trouble, maybe Robot John can save them.  Maybe.

Another question, does this film even have an actual plot?  Or is it simply: Astronauts land on Venus and have various difficulties when they get there?

I suppose it doesn't help that I couldn't finish this movie.  I watched about 2/3 of it and decided it was a truly terrible way to spend a perfectly good hour.",1290902400,,1652,4.488215488215488

3421280,4,B0018TNAIQ,"The politics of saving at all costs coupled with a good ability to use scissors and assembly, rather than to kick up a fuss, in the '60s still ensures a good response from the audience and this film is one of the best known examples American science fiction films made by using long lengths of Russian films. (The seven sailors of the space) aka Planeta Burg (which is considered appropriate to mention the cast titles) comes from Harrington cut, reassembled and sewn around some specially filmed sequences in the studio (and think for themselves be reused later) with an anonymous Basil Rathbone in the scientist. The plot itself is the carbon paper copy of the story told by the director Pavlev Klushantsev
This imaginative and highly visual film is actually a Soviet-made production titled Planeta Bur, which was purchased by Roger Corman and American International Pictures and refashioned into a more simplistic science fiction-adventure for American audiences. Former experimental filmmaker and Kenneth Anger associate Curtis Harrington (using the nom du cinema John Harrington) was pressed into directing new footage featuring Basil Rathbone and Faith Domergue, which was incorporated into the film for Hollywood name value (such as it was at the time). The end result gives enticing glimpses of Russian director Pavel Klushantsev's original vision and some impressive special effects (most notably, the air car and the crew's mechanical helpmate Robot John), which are unfortunately dampened by the newer, more awkward-looking scenes. Ever the penny-pincher, Corman recycled the Russian footage for a second, less coherent feature, 1966's Voyage to the Planet of Prehistoric Women, which featured scenes with Mamie Van Doren shot by then-novice director Peter Bogdanovich.",1274140800,,1780,5.4296028880866425

They bring  with them a very sophisticated robot called John which resembles up to a point Robbie the robot of the other space movie FORBIDDEN PLANET. They also move around in a floating vehicle. After narrowly escaping destruction they leave in a hurry discovering at this very end that its inhabitants are very much like us.

'Voyage to the Prehistoric Planet', starring Basil Rathbone and Faith Domergue is essentially a Russian film originally titled, 'Planeta Bur' [Planet of Storms]. With Roger Corman as Executive Producer, the original film was rather abruptly and crudely edited, and then the two aforementioned American actors' roles were basically pasted on to the film for audience appeal as nothing more than a trite afterthought.

WHAT 'Voyage to the Prehistoric Planet' IS ALL ABOUT:

Well, this film is a rather shabbily constructed much-ado-about-nothing space-opera. There are a few notable special effects, such as, the hovercar, the robot [John], and the jumping men in the rubber dinosaur suits. There is also something resembling a brontosaurus but it does not look or act very convincing.

This film is really hurt by the fact that it is obvious that niether Rathbone or Domergue are ever really in scenes with the rest of the original cast, and are in fact in a seperate production spliced into the original feature to gain the attention of American audiences. This promotional effort is done to the detriment of the finished film.

BOTTOM LINE: A POOR PRINT OF A DISAPPOINTING FILM ABOUT A MOST INTERESTING TOPIC - SPACE EXPLORATION

I would suggest trying to find a copy of 'Planeta Bur', the original Russian film or simply look for something else within the genre to watch.",1165104000,,1780,5.136363636363637
3421287,3,B0018TNAIQ,"Making bad movies can be tiring work, especially when you're Roger Corman and make a practice of filming a second film, usually made up entirely on the spot, at each shooting location.  One fateful day Roger had an epiphany - why make a completely new bad movie when he could just steal someone else's?  So it was that, in 1965, Corman bought the rights to a 1962 Russian film called Planeta Burg.  Add a few new scenes, mix in a lot of bad dubbing, and slap some fake credits on that puppy - and Voila! you've got yourself another Roger Corman masterpiece - and all without breaking a sweat.  (Personally, I would have edited out the big CCCP logo on the main spaceship, but Corman chose not to.)  Who cares if the Soviets don't like your mucking around with their movie?  What are they gonna do - declare a Cold War over it?  Set up missiles in Cuba?  Of course, continuing his 2-for-1 moviemaking practice, Corman didn't stop there, scavenging Planeta Burg once again to make Voyage to the Planet of Prehistoric Women in 1968.  Here's what really gets my goat, though.  I actually sort of enjoyed Voyage to the Prehistoric Planet.  I can't imagine why, but I did.

This film takes us back to the good old days, when you didn't have to worry about weightlessness in space and you could gallivant around Venus in a space suit.  Watch out for those meteors, though, as one-third of the potential cast learns just after the fake opening credits.  Fortunately (or not), the other ships make it to Venusian orbit and decide to head on down without waiting for the go-ahead from Professor Hartmann (Basil Rathbone) back on Lunar Base 7.  The first ship apparently crashes, leaving our three burly Russian friends in the second ship to execute a rescue mission upon landing.  Meanwhile, Marcia (Faith Domergue) remains alone in orbit, so that she can perform such crucial functions as forgetting to tell the search party where the lost astronauts are located on the planet.

You'll cheer as Andre (who really belongs on a short leash) is attacked by a gigantic spider-plant, but all too soon you realize that nothing is going to happen to any of these annoying characters (Andre even jabs a needle into a brontosaurus at one point, without the big guy even noticing).  But what of our lost astronauts, you ask?  Well, they have Robot John (obviously a cousin to Robbie the Robot) to look after their puny hides while they wait to be rescued.  Personally, I would rather have the hovercar that the second crew of astronauts uses to traverse the planet.  The Soviets really did a good job on the special effects for this thing, as it looks just as good as Luke's hovercar in the original theatrical version of Star Wars.

Indulge me as I insert my MST3K-inspired John! Marsha!  John!! Marsha!! non sequitur here.  Thanks.  Well, Robot John pretty much gets the shaft toward the end of this thing, while Marsha almost ruins everything yet comes out smiling.  The only reason she's even in the movie is Roger Corman, who chose to add her and an aging Basil Rathbone to the film he ripped off to make it look like his own.  Neither character serves any real purpose, which is sort of sad in Rathbone's case, as he deserved better.

The only thing missing from this Corman classic is a few buxom blondes, an oversight Corman corrected in 1968 when he used the same Russian footage to show us what was on the other side of the ""red city"" that attracted Andre's attention in particular - Mamie Van Doren and friends.  If you're going to watch Voyage to the Prehistoric Planet, you might as well check out Voyage to the Planet of Prehistoric Women, too.  After all, Roger would have wanted it that way.",1157241600,,3688,4.620583717357911
3421288,1,B0018TNAIQ,"The bulk of this movie is a Russian piece of dreck that Roger Corman brought over and dubbed in the dialog. Then he filmed new scenes with Basil Rathbone and some woman with a bee hive hairdo and spliced it all together to make a new movie. The new scenes add nothing and just leave you disoriented as you go from a dubbed scene to a non-dubbed scene.

Two ships of astronauts land on Venus to explore the planet. One of the ships crashes, so the when the other lands, they have to rescue the first crew. Along the way they run into prehistoric animal life and a volcanic eruption. The first crew also has a robot named of all things, John. The robot talks and walks very slowly and I have no idea what good he is for anything.

The biggest problem with this movie is it's boring as all get-out. Nothing happens. One scene runs into another but they never achieve any real coherence or relevance. The effects are classic. A pterodactyl attacks in one scene. It looks like it was made out of papier mache or something as it has no moveable parts. It just flies like a big lump. My favorites are the lizards which are obviously guys in rubber suits jumping up and down. Hilarious.",1155513600,,1178,4.35
3421289,2,B0018TNAIQ,"This is a true wonder of the cinematic world. Roger Corman took the remnants of a lame Soviet sci-fi movie, ""Planeta Burg,""  dubbed it into English, added a couple of western actors including Basil Rathbone, and called it a movie. This film is essentially a bunch of often-seen stock footage shown in glorious sepia and gray. (The box says the film is in color, but the reality is generally otherwise.) This is a real chore to get through even for devoted fans of bad movies.

The plot, as much of it as there is, concerns three groups of voyagers to Venus. One of the ships crashes outright, one has great difficulty landing, and the third lands successfully. I am fond of the endless scenes of the third group of astronauts pondering what the red lights below the clouds of Venus are, as that's where they are going to land. The conclusion seems to be some type of lava and that they would all be burned up. Bearing in mind that discretion is the greater part of valor, does it make a lot of sense to try to land on lava after the first two ships to attempt the landing have utterly failed?

The intrepid explorers land safely in a non-lava area, and begin hiking, whereupon they find giant man-eating octopus flowers, and the most ridiculous six foot tall tyrannosaurus creatures ever seen, which, it develops, have a propensity for wrestling around in mud with the astronauts. There is also an extremely lame robot named, creatively enough, ""Robot John."" There are endless scenes about women who sing like Sirens, and much cross-Venusian trekking.  The astronauts have particularly silly and incongruous equipment, especially their atomic powered flying car, and are dubbed into English with some of the worst dialogue in film history.

The general directorial premise of this film seemed to be ""throw a bunch of movies in a blender and press the mix button."" The bewildering array of footage, impossible color matching, and ridiculous yet predictable plot make this film a tough slog. As a mind-numbing bad film, this is tough to beat. I give it two stars for the audacious compilation of film from so many sources into a finished work that almost makes sense. Watch it at your own risk, because only the strong survive.

As a further warning, this film was later recut yet again a year later with even more jarring and disjointed scenes (featuring Mamie Van Doren) and released as ""Voyage to the Planet of Prehistoric Women."" In case you may be wondering, it failed to improve ""Voyage to the Prehistoric Planet,"" and that's saying something.",1140048000,,2547,4.777272727272727
3421290,3,B0018TNAIQ,"Travel to Venus with a bunch of scientific-looking guys and an impressive robot that thinks of itself first.  Why travel to Venus?  Answer:  To look for intelligent life, because it apparently does not exist on Earth.

There are reasonably good special effects as the intrepid voyagers head off to Venus to rescue those daring young men in their landing machine that accidentally crashed on Venus because that was how they set up the plot of the story.  I hope all that is clear.  This movie started life as a Soviet science fiction film (which the Soviet government may have palmed off as a documentary, for all we know).  Roger Corman became the executive producer, and he spliced in scenes of Faith Domergue (who has appeared in numerous B-science fiction flicks) as Dr. Marsha (Marsha, Marsha, Marsha!) Evans and Basil Rathbone (in one of his last films, a sad end for the man who is often identified as Sherlock Holmes) as Professor Hartman.  Corman cleverly has Evans and Hartman in different locations, both communicating with the men on Venus, thus keeping everyone from knowing that these shots were added to someone else's film to make a completely different film.

The shots of Faith Domergue and Basil Rathbone were unnecessary and distracting.  The best shots are on Venus, as the men are attacked by guys in rubber Godzilla suits, only people-sized instead of king-sized, a tentacled plant, and a flying reptile that looks suspiciously like the bird in ""The Giant Claw.""  There are obligatory tense moments involving the poisonous atmosphere of Venus, earthquakes (or is that Venusquakes?), lava and a flood.  How fortunate that it was not blizzard season!

In spite of the somewhat vague plot and the inability of people to find each other so that they could be rescued, this movie has a couple of bright spots, those being a robot and a ""space car"" (their terminology, not mine).  The robot is one of the most impressive robots I have seen, ranking with Robbie the Robot, and the robot from ""Lost in Space.""  The space car looks like it could have been in ""Fireball XL5"" or ""Thunderbirds,"" and also adds a bright spot to this movie.

The plot drags in places, the sound is weak, the scenes with Domergue and Rathbone were unnecessary, and the attack from the water that I kept expecting never arrived.  Yet, I somehow managed to enjoy this movie.  I think it was because the Venus scenes had some charm to it.  I will only recommend this movie to hardcore science fiction film fans, or to fans of Roger Corman; everyone else to move on to something else.

A tantalizing tidbit:  There is a sequel to this movie titled ""Voyage to the Planet of Prehistoric Women,"" which features Mamie Van Doren.  It seems that while the men in this movie were wandering around trying to rescue their comrades, there were a bunch of hot babes wandering around looking for the men.  What a meeting that would have been!",1137369600,,2916,4.764940239043825
3421291,2,B0018TNAIQ,"VOYAGE TO A PREHISTORIC PLANET was made in 1965, stars Basil Rathbone, and the cover depicts one snarling and one glaring dinosaur towering over three space-suited astronauts.  Does anything more really need be said?

 Plot - The year is 2020 and American astronauts and Russian cosmonauts are traveling to Venus.  I've read somewhere that this is a Russia film that had scenes inserted and some phony American credits plastered on it prior to release, but wasn't interested enough to see if my favorite internet search engine could cough up the answers to that mystery.  Rathbone plays a scientist on the satellite Lunar 7 and the other `star' in this one, Faith Domergue, is an astronautlette on the Venus-orbiting Vega.  A handful of `nauts and John the Robot are on the Venus surface, dodging the stray alamosaurus and/or 12-foot-tall man-eating venus flytrap while finding evidence of an ancient Venusian civilization.

 There probably was an okay Russian movie here before Roger Corman Productions got their hands on this one.  John the Robot is cool and some of the special effects are a cut above the standard glop they were putting out then.  The story drags terribly, though, and Rathbone is apparently included for name recognition rather than to serve the plot or to move things along.  Thankfully, they don't dress him up in a goofy costume or otherwise embarrass him.  The pacing is terrible, the dubbing is atrocious and there's no drama to speak of.  The print, although the color is somewhat washed out and there are some scratches, is in okay condition.  Not recommended.",1126915200,,1589,4.992395437262357
3421292,3,B0018TNAIQ,"Yes, this is indeed the eastern european sci fi classic in it's Cormanized form, before being totally destroyed in it's final VOYAGE TO THE PLANET OF PREHISTORIC WOMEN incarnation. Here we get added scenes of Basil Rathbone as the head of an extremely boring moonbase, and Faith Domergue as Marcia, the communications relay person between the moon and Venus. On Venus itself, we have two sets of astronauts (cosmonauts) looking for each other. One group encounters a man-eating plant (much like the one in Angry Red Planet), a bunch of stuffed dinosaur puppets, and a mysterious singing lady. The others must deal with a horde of lizard-men, the lava from an erupting volcano, and a robot that wants to dump them into the molten flow! Speaking of the robot, it's actually pretty cool looking. It's up there with Robby (Forbidden Planet) and the B9 (TV's Lost In Space)! All in all, VTTPP is a good waste of time on a rainy afternoon...",1121644800,,935,4.777777777777778
3421293,2,B0018TNAIQ,"How many hands in how many pots by how many cooks on how many stoves in how many countries does it take to ruin a movie? I think the answer is not very much, as the classic Manos: Hands of Fate showed us. However, the makers of this film, and there were many, decided to test going the other direction. This movie has had more hands on it than Paris Hilton.

Portions of this movie were originally known as ""Planeta Burg"" (Russian for ""Planet of Storms"") and had a cast of several almost not so bad Russian actors. This footage, captured with state of the art communist photo machines, is almost not grainy. In fact, on the Beer Scale of Footage Quality, this ranks ""Killian's Irish Red"" meaning the footage is slightly more clear than looking through a pint of Guinness.

But that's not even the best part, the best part was the footage that was spliced in when the film came to America. There are crystal clear shots of Basil Rathbone and Faith Domergue added. You can see Faith Domergue in ""This Island Earth"" that was so succesfully riffed as the feature of ""Mystery Science Theatre: 3000 The Movie.""

Also, there are some scenes spliced in with American quality special effects (America was even ahead of the USSR in Z-film movie quality). From this mish mash of cinematography, the producers decided to find complete idiots to do the voice dubs of the Russian actors. At least I hope these people are idiots, they may just in fact be people with profound mental retardation, in which case their efforts are laudable.

A funny note here, the dubbing of the film was pretty bad, but what makes it hilarious is the fact that the Rathbone and Faith Domergue lines are not dubbed at all.

So, the Russian Director, the U.S. director Curtis Harrington, and the fall guy Roger Corman all added their individual specialties to this work of a thousand authors, and the result? Mud.

Wait, that's an insult to made, at least mud is consistent.

Oh yeah, I didn't even mention silly things like plots and performances and neat stuff about this film...

Maybe because there were none.",1115424000,,2078,4.627717391304348
3421294,3,B0018TNAIQ,"This is for those of you who have a taste for the strange, esoteric joys of B moviemaking.  Notorious cheapie producer Roger Corman has evidently bought an interesting, serious sci-fi opus made in the '50s behind the Iron Curtain, dubbed it into English and added brief scenes of the great thespian Basil Rathbone and Faith (This Island Earth) Domergue and it comes off like something David Lynch would dream up!  It makes no sense, but it's fascinating!  Rathbone's diction is so veddy erudite (though noticeably slurred in one scene), and he seems bored and bummed out, but he's got the MAGIC- even though his scenes are shot entirely seperate from everyone else in the movie.  Domergue, gorgeous just a few years before, is unrecognizable- something dreadful was happening to this actress to make her so haggard and listless.  She ""communicates"" with cosmonauts on Venus through a microphone on a panel, and halfway through, removes her lab coat to reveal her once stunning figure in a sweater.  After that, the two English-speaking actors are not seen again (they dub in some dialogue to ""explain"" what happened to Domergue).  The cosmonauts are obviously from another movie.  They all look so Slavic it's amazing (kind of resemble young Charles Bronson): short noses, long upper lips, wide, stern mouths, beetling brows, and craggy cheeks, but with teased Kremlin-style pompadores like TV evangelists (what is it with Communism and high hair, does it represent Progress?)  The prop designs are pure Workers' Paradise Futurism: retro-cool (to us) spacesuits, and a robot that looks like it lumbered out of a Socialist Realist poster.  Whatever language they're speaking, the consonants and vowels roughly match up with the English translation, but the dialogue is delivered so monotonously by the dubbers, and the ""philosophical"" discussions are so awkwardly pointless, that the odd phrasing and long, inappropriate pauses make for a very weird dialogue track.  There's an impressive Brontosaurus (basically stationary), a nifty man-eating plant, some ridiculous men in rubber dinosaur suits and a ""pteradactyl"" that looks like a vulcanized rubber Muppet, but the coolest thing is the hovering, bubble-topped land-rover they ride around in.  Get the Diamond Entertainment version that has ""First Spaceship on Venus"" on the same DVD- the transfer is basically in magenta and gray, panned and scanned by a guy who obviously wanted to get home early, and in one scene there's a green, horn-shaped piece of crud that gets stuck in the film gate for about 20 seconds, but I got it for under $7, and I was spellbound.",1073174400,,2615,5.156028368794326

There is a tough metal robot that is realistic.  Dinosaurs and other nasties try to make a meal of various crew members without success.
