8020769,5,B00022PYSE,"I've seen just about every Warped Tour DVD, and unlike the Beyond Warped disc (which, by the way, sucked), this one delivers everything you could possibly ask for from the Warped Tour. Obviously, the smaller bands are important to the tour, but the 2003 Warped Tour DVD focuses more on the main stage bands, everything from the punk to the screamo to the heavier stuff, and it doesn't disappoint at all. It covers all the small things that make Warped fun, but doesn't focus for too long away from the bands and still manages to be entertaining. Kung Fu Films are the best! True believers, all the way!",1339372800,,602,4.583333333333333
8020770,5,B00022PYSE,"Out of all of the Warped Tour DVDs I have seen, I have found this one to be the best. The others are good too.  It may be because I like most of the bands on this one but there seems to be done with a focus on heavier sounding bands, i.e. Glassjaw, Avenged Sevenfold, Poison the Well.  There is tons of live footage & commentary from each band.  I found the Glassjaw, Face to Face, Dropkick Murpheys, Poison the Well, Avenged Sevenfold, & Something Corporate performances to be the best but they are all pretty good on this DVD.",1113523200,6,528,4.26
8020771,4,B00022PYSE,"Looking for a keepsake from the 2003 Warped tour besides that Rancid t-shirt you bought? Look no further in the form of the official 2003 DVD, with performances from Glassjaw, Andrew W.K, Dropkick Murphy's, the Used, Avenged Sevenfold and Poison the Well. This well put together DVD shows what daily life on the Warped tour is like, showcases the artists involved and features a wide spectrum of music that stretches across the punk and hardcore worlds. Where else are you going to find a live version of Andrew W.K's `We Want Fun'? That alone is worth the price of admission.",1096502400,3,576,4.77
8020772,2,B00022PYSE,"Granted this DVD is average and has some good footage of Warped bands playing live and some good interviews but all the wrong songs from the bands. The Pennywise song was ""God Save the USA"" it should have been ""Bro Hymn Tribute"", The Suicide Machines song was ""Did You Ever Get a Feeling of Dread"" while it should have been "" New Girl"" or ""S.O.S."", Rancid should have been ""Radio"" or perhaps "" Olympia WA"" but instead it was ""Journey to the End of the East Bay"". Then there are songs from terrible bands on here like; Rufio, Mest, Something Corporate,  Sum 41, S.T.U.N., Simple Plan, and Vaux. I guess there just on here to cash in on money since though bands are popular. Granted it was cheap for reason, but I suggest Punk Rock Summer Camp instead.",1094083200,3,750,4.434782608695652
8020773,5,B00022PYSE,"This is a great representation of what Warped Tour is all about. The music is great and the behind the scenes videos are also very good. I wish that they would have included more than one song by a few of the bands, like on last year's DVD, but it is still very good. If you like punk rock, buy this DVD immediately",1089331200,3,315,4.015873015873016
