1916116,4,B0000CABH8,"My girlfriend and I rented the first DVD collection in this series on a whim.  I, personally, am a big fan of Ninja Scroll (cliche I know), Trigun, Vampire Hunter D, and the Dirty Pair collections.  My girlfriend leans more towards Sailor Moon style Anime but enjoys most of the ones I like.  We both really got into this series...if that tells you anything.
Berserk contains an interesting mixture of violence (not as rough as Ninja Scroll)and melodrama (though not as ham-handed as the Evangelion series) as well as dropping in a touch of humor, typically at the expense of particularly brash and obnoxious villains.  The story moves at a confusingly erratic pace but is still engaging, following the protagonist into his past and his evolution as a mercenary for the most legendary band of mercs in the lands.  The supporting cast seems similar to the type of RPG castes used in other Animes like Lodoss War.  The obnoxious kid, the big tough guy, the strong willed warrior, etc. The animation is strong however.  Not quite on par with most of the afore mentioned titles, but still impressive and worth viewing.  Interestingly enough there are more homoerotic undertones between the protagonist and the mercenary leader than in any ten episodes of the WWE and Queer Eye for the Straight Guy combined.  If you shy away from this type of thing, be warned.  Ohterwise it's a solid buy.
Side note:  the DVD features include outtake scenes of the voice actors either screwing up or just goofing off.  This alone is funny enough to make this series worth at least looking at.",1070841600,9,1572,4.781481481481482
1916117,5,B0000CABH8,"Words cannot desribe Berserk.  This series goes beyond simply being an exceptional anime it is one of the greatest stories ever told as far as I am concerned.  I was deeply moved by this series.  Do not pass it up.  100% entertaining, thought provoking and moving.
WARNING: It has an insanely depressing ending/conclusion.  Do not view if you can't handle unhappy endings because this one takes the cake.  I have never seen an ending so excruciatingly painful and agonizing to watch because of the torture that the lead characters are forced to endure on such a surrealistic and epic scale.  It would be hard not be disturbed by it.",1069545600,6,632,4.743119266055046
1916118,5,B0000CABH8,"I'm not going to tell you how great Berserk is (especially in character development, story and dramatization departments). Other reviews do that well. I'm writing this to inform all friends of Berserk about Michael Moorcock's Elric of Melnibone saga from which Kentarou Miura has a great deal of influence. If you liked Berserk then you MUST do yourself a favor and read the Elric saga. Except the Elric saga one other major influence is Corum saga by the same author. Maybe you want to check that also.
Ps: Elric of Melnibone and Corum saga's are parts of the Eternal Champion series",1067990400,2,584,4.792079207920792
1916119,4,B0000CABH8,"I rented this series on a couple suggestions from some anime fans I know. I had only seen Cowboy Bebop prior to this, and I enjoyed that series. Berserk was such a pleasant surprise to me, I found that I couldn't wait to get home from work so that I could see what was going to happen next to these endearing characters.
Now for the caveats --
VIOLENCE: There is violence here. Lots and lots of blood. In fact, it often sprays like a garden hose.
SEX: There is some nudity and sexual situations. Not a lot of them, but there's a scene on the last episode that some people may find schocking.
UNFINISHED?: Speaking of the last episode, you may find the entire last episode disturbingly loose-ended. I still find myself wanting more, but I think it just means I really enjoyed the series.
SPECIAL FEATURES: I'm not sure about the box set, since it hasn't yet been released as of this writing, but the series released by Media Blasters had some hilarious OUTTAKES which had me laughing out loud. Very entertaining extra feature.
The storyline is very satisfying. There are significant milestones throughout; not just a lot of build-up for one great climactic ending. Meaningful happenings occur on a regular basis, and there are many subtle underlying themes that I missed the first time 'round. The English voices are surprisingly good. There are the occasional cheesy actors who shout too much, but you get used to that before long. The animation is a combination of still comic-book-style shots and animated scenes. They combine the two effectively.
From a new anime viewer, I highly recommend this one.",1066003200,9,1603,4.76978417266187
1916120,5,B0000CABH8,"I checked out Berserk because I couldn't get the theme song (""Forces"") out of my head after viewing the trailer on a Kenshin disc.  The preview makes it looks like yet another thin story propping up the usual violence and gore.  Well, there's ample violence and bloodshed, but  deeper themes flesh out the narrative and characters:  friendship, comradeship, duty, rivalry, jealousy, loyalty, ambition, torment, betrayal, sacrifice, destiny... the shadows of the past, power and the lack of it, the search for a place to belong and being able to recognize it when you find it.
Let's face it - it ends on a cliffhanger.  It's unlikely to be resolved in anime form, but there's the manga, and there are Berserk websites to fill in the blanks.  If you can deal with the loose ends (of course you can!) and you're OK with the high quota of violence, then settle in for a wild ride.
If you're interested in Miura's manga, Dark Horse is due to start releasing an English-language version of each volume (first issue ISBN: 1593070209).  Or track down the Japanese-language original - the art is first-rate, even if you don't read Japanese!",1064361600,3,1131,4.798969072164948
1916121,5,B0000CABH8,"Hands down the best Anime (for guys and tough girls) there is and maybe ever will be.  It never hit center stage...anywhere so far...but it has a phenomenal story line with superb character development, plot layout, climax, and grand finale.  If you are considering reading the manga instead, I highly recommend watching this first.  Conversation and story unfold much more fluidly in the anime.",1062547200,4,395,5.140625
1916122,5,B0000CABH8,"One of the favorite anime of all times. I think you cant really compare it to anything,,,you can say its violent and just too weird, but there is alot more to it...It's a story of a struggle, love and revenge + much more killing in between. If you watch it and feel confused by the ending, i sugest geting manga which goes really far into it and is still in production to date. (before that i have never read manga, really enjoyed it and cant wait for more to come out)

1916133,5,B0000CABH8,"This is a really good anime. I would recommend it to anyone who likes serious anime. My only dislikes is the absence of the Skull Knight from the whole series who is a key character to the Berserk universe and of course the fact that this is only 25 episodes and doesn't continue.  I would recommend it to anyone who likes serious anime. However speaking in terms of recommendation, I would strongly recommend anyone interested in this series, anime,comics, manga or anything great to read the Berserk manga. It continues way past where this show ends and is extremely well done by Kentaro Miura with unparalleled artwork in my opinion.

Just a small part of the bigger work that is the original manga, and the ending is killer. Mostly because it just stops.  There should have been a season two and the fact that there is not is what keeps me from giving it five stars. Not for the faint of heart, but worth a look if you love gritty, real characterizations.",1312416000,,487,4.34065934065934
1916156,4,B0000CABH8,"Mostly everyone here have touched upon the aspects that make this a real Anime must-buy so I will start off by tempering your expectations just a bit (before I sing my own accolades)..  First and foremost, this collection is not truly complete; that is, if you expect closure in your storytelling.  It is, however, as complete as it gets right now.  There have been talks about a movie or a possible series reboot but it's hard to tell if that will happen now, though Berserk has a VERY strong cult following.

Berserk Complete claims to be ""fully remastered"" but don't expect extreme polish here.  The visuals and music work but this is NOT a re-buy for those that already own all Berserk works.  That said, this IS the perfect ""gateway"" for anyone wishing to check out what Berserk is all about...

The Berserk story dates back to as far back as the early 90s.  Like many of you out there, the Sega Dreamcast video game was my first real entry point for the series, though I had been exposed to the Manga and Anime previously.  It's one of those stories that will surely grip you if you give it a chance.  I, too, worried that it would be all action and no real substance.  Surely, that formula works sometimes but we have enough Dragon Ball Z's in the world..  Berserk is different.

Now here is where the fanboy in me lights up with joy: the collection is, by far, your best bang for the buck.  The entire Berserk Anime series (thus far) in one place.  Few entertainment purchases can be positioned as no-brainers but, if you truly love Anime, then consider this one such purchase!

Berserk the Anime and Berserk the Manga differ quite a bit.  The Anime is a little more ""soapy"".  The original writer and creator of Berserk, Kentaro Miura, took the Anime in a slightly different direction; thus, it focused more on the themes of friendship, betrayal, and ambition, whereas the manga focused a lot more on the supernatural, causality, and predeterminism.  The main story remains mostly the same so no worries there!

Believe me, I know there is tons of Anime out there but this is one of the few you HAVE to watch (again and again).  Beneath all the violence and gore, there's a deep story line carried by dynamic characters and a haunting musical score.  Really, the only complaint I have is that I wish there was more.  Even the ""classic"" Anime style fits the story well.  Berserk Complete FTW.",1301616000,,2399,4.577464788732394
1916157,4,B0000CABH8,"Some parts of the Manga left out, but well done show. Outtakes are hilarious and the animation is nice and bloody. I can't wait for the rumored second season to come out.",1298332800,,170,4.34375
1916158,5,B0000CABH8,"Alright, I lied about it being a good series to watch with a date (unless your me). This series is by far my all time favorite. I love the story, artwork, and characters. Berserk is a very violent and gory anime series. It is NOT for children, people with weak bladders, those who can't stand the sight of blood or who are deeply religious. This series however good it is. Has never been completed. Yes, this is half of a series. They ran out of funding. The last episode ends at a very hard scene. Just a warning.",1296777600,,514,4.255102040816326
1916159,5,B0000CABH8,"This is a very good anime. The animation is not top notch in any way, but the story is second to none. This anime gets its spirit from the Manga that it comes from, and if your into comics, I'd have to recommend picking a few of those up, they're damn good. But back to the anime; Like the manga, it is very mature in content and theme. Which is made incredibly evident on the last episode(I literally get pissed off very time I watch it). What kept me into this anime was the music, the story and the characters. All of which are top notch.

If your looking for an anime with a mature theme and interesting characters, this would be a great one to consider.",1250467200,,658,4.181102362204724
1916160,5,B0000CABH8,"Berserk is not a perfect anime. In fact, it has many problems. Nonetheless, no story has ever affected me as viscerally.

First the problems.
1. Visually, Berserk is not stunning. The animation is definitely sub-par; there were times when I felt like I was watching a slideshow with sound.

2. The first few episodes were dull and made Guts seem very one-dimensional. I wondered whether I should continue watching such a poorly animated series if there was no depth to the characters.

3. As the anime progressed, Guts became much more than a bloodthirsty swordsman. Griffith and Casca too were fleshed out into interesting characters with deep motives. Berserk is a story about Guts, Casca and Griffith: sometimes I felt as if the other members of the Band of the Hawk were just stock characters. This isn't a major critique, just an observation.

That's all for the bad parts. The plot becomes engrossing if you can stomach the first few episodes. The plot has its moments of intensity and darkness, but the overall intensity of the plot pales in comparison to its ending. I felt as if the brunt of the story was a vehicle for increasing the visceral potency of the ending. Some people hates that the series ended on the note that it did; I loved it.

It sent me on a dark fantasy bender. I began searching for something dark and bitter that could affect me as powerfully as Berserk's ending. There was nothing. The premise of Death Note seemed to fit the bill but, in the end, it was cheery and weak relative to Berserk. The only thing that evokes some of the same dark themes with similar is Clive Barker's dark fantasy. I suspect Miura was inspired by Hell Raiser's cenobites, at least with respect to designing the God Hand. If you're left with a gaping void after watching Berserk, and I guarantee that you will be, try exploring some of Barker's darker works.",1245456000,,1867,4.6626139817629175
1916161,5,B0000CABH8,"Ok, so maybe this product was a little expensive, but it is well worth it.  I had a hacked version of this already ($0 dollars), but the BOX OF WAR video quality is so much better, I would definitely recommend buying this item.",1237334400,,227,4.27906976744186
1916162,5,B0000CABH8,"Miura Kentaro's amazing storyline drives this masterpiece of animation and gore into another world. Its a dark and graphic, often brutal, midevil world that offers every type of emotion available.

The animation itself is drawn with great detail and meticulous attention to scenery considering when it was made.

The japanese cast of voice actors is superb. The dubbed versions...i couldn't really get into. For my money, the subtitles are where its at. Although the dubbed out-takes had me on the ground laughing.

This is often a greatly misunderstood anime because of where it starts off, it makes more sense to start at episode 2, and watch from there to the end, then watch episode 1.

The only downside to the entire series is that it leaves you wanting more when its over. More from a world that pulls you in and takes a chunk out of your heart, and leaves you there bleeding for some finality.",1232323200,,901,4.756410256410256
1916173,4,B0000CABH8,"Being a fanatical reader of Kentaro's series, I bought this without a second thought. I was quite pleased with the animated version, even if I knew what was coming before hand. I will say that it is quite docile in comparison to the manga. That is, it isn't as explicit as the imagery within the books.

Some folks might be slightly put-off by the rather anti-climatic ending, but I'd still recommend it. It's quite fun. The bloopers are great to watch as well. Especially the sections where Griffith's voice actor is singing.

While I'm at it, if you've watched this and want more, go read the manga. A fair warning though, it's not for the faint-of-heart.",1221609600,,657,4.655172413793103
1916174,5,B0000CABH8,"I loved Braveheart and Rob Roy And similar movies which are set in midevil times and this is what attracted me to First Renting Berserk and then Buying it after renting all the discs.

If you are a fan of engaging storylines within a more realistic setting then most animes then Berserk is a MUST BUY.

The Anime can seem outdated, The English Voice acting can seem a little over the top at times and their are a million fight scenes with 10000 Gallons of blood being spilled. That being said. This is one of the  best Animes I have ever seen.

The Music is perfectly placed throughout each scene as the story moves forward episode to episode. And At times you forget your watching an ""Anime"" And feel your watching an Epic Movie. At least thats how great it was to watch Berserk for the first (of several) time.

Sure Some episodes might move along a little slower at times.. This wasn't an issue for me as i like to get to know the characters and you have to realize its 20+ Episodes. A Perfect Story blends action with drama and character building etc etc.

6 Years later I have yet to find anything to come close to Berserk. No Anime compares to this work of art known as Berserk.

There is 2 ways to watch the series.

Start with Episode 2 and watch the whole thing and when your done go back and watch Episode 1 for the first time.

Or Start with Episode 1 and watch the whole series and it may or maynot give things away that happen later on.

Basically Episode 1 is ment for TV views to be Pulled into the series.
Episode 2 is really the Start of the Berserk Story.",1219190400,3,1573,4.248322147651007

This series got it all, feelings, blood, gore, facialexpressions, complicated storyline, loveable characters and some great artwork.

I can`t compare this to anything else really, Berserk is in a class of it`s own..

1916178,5,B0000CABH8,"OK, let's get the only downside out of the way first. Technically, some of the animation now looks a bit clunky. But, frankly, once the plot arc and characters really get hold of you, it simply doesn't matter. Once hooked, this one does not want to let go.

I can see why it was aired late night- this one is definitely not one for the kiddies. Unless they're into really dark fantasy, plot convolutions, complex characterisation and buckets of gore.

I have no problem with the apocalyptic ending. Some of the visions are straight out of Heironymous Bosch. This is a fantasy, remember?

But, dammit, I want to know how Guts gets past the Dark Eclipse and becomes the Dark Swordsman.

So, how about it, guys...?!

Jon Bower",1199404800,3,723,4.6171875
1916179,4,B0000CABH8,"OK, first of all, this's undoubtedly a great story. On the whole, the original manga is classified as fantasy genre. And I love the original one, too. Since this anime version doesn't go beyond the first season, you don't get to see the world of swords, magic and monsters except for the first, and a couple of episodes in the end. So it is more like a period drama of the protagonist's golden era of youth with his best friend and downfall. And it still works! Maybe even better for some people.

My problem is the translation! I don't only mean the sub but also English dub. Some of the translation is utterly wrong and sometimes flip the meaning to complete opposite! For example, see the correct translation first, ""My dream can only be realized by stepping over the bones of the dead. After all, it is a dream of blood shed. I don't regret or feel guilty for this. But my dream is not cheap enough to realize without myself getting dirty while risking hundreds of thousands of others' lives."" Now see the line for English dub, ""I can't just step over the bones of the dead in order to realize it. My dream, my dream is already smeared by blood. I don't regret. I don't feel guilty. But I'd rather sacrifice myself than watching any more innocent children die in the name of my dream.""...it ruins everything.

Another problem is North American voice actors! When will they ever learn to act professionally. All those overacting with too much grunt, absurdly clear pronunciation with exaggerated stress on each sylable that make intonation weird! Sickening. And you know what, the story takes place in feudal era much like Dark Age. King and princess and knight and aristocrats! Please, speak British accent! In live films, even North American born actors speak British accent in period stories! That's the real professional actors.

Some of you who read my review might say, ""Why don't you watch in Japanese, then, if you have problem with English dub and you can understand Japanese?"" I'll say, ""Does it look like Samurai story? Is there any Japanes in the story? Didn't you ever feel weird to watch blondies with fair face speak Japanese to each other in stories that obviously take place in countries other than Japan? That's my problem.""",1196726400,,2245,4.707379134860051
1916180,5,B0000CABH8,"This is the kind of show that keeps me wanting to check out new anime!  I can honestly say that I couldn't hardly stop watching the series until I went through all the disks!  The cliff-hanger at the end of the series even got me reading english translated manga.

1916181,5,B0000CABH8,"""Berserk"" is the first fantasy anime to catch my attention for a very long time, and boy did it ever!  The series rolls along at an even pace following the exploits of a mercenary group named The Band of the Hawk.  The protagonist, (named ""Guts"" in English and ""Gatsu"" in Japanese) is introduced in a sequence that takes place after the events of the series as a travelling demon slayer with an impossibly huge sword (compensating for something there, buddy?) and is obviously a warrior whose seen it all.  By the time the story is done, you will see why.  Keep this scene in mind as it is as close to the real ending you will be screaming for when the final episode ends as you're going to get.

The series takes place in a European-style medievel setting, and we find young Guts making his mark on the world as a mercenary for the Midland army, locked in a 100 year war with a neighboring country.  The leader of Midland's premier mercenary fighting force, Griffith, recruits Guts after he finds his soldiers being dominated by his huge sword during a scuffle.  The result for The Hawks is an invincible new field captain to match the brilliant tactics of their commander.  As The Hawks gain fame and acclaim for their deeds on the battlefield, they are forced to deal with not only increasingly crafty foes on the field of battle, but with the scheming and plotting of their own nobles, who seek to protect their prestige from the band of ruffians rising through their ranks.  This arc makes up the bulk of the series, but there is so much more brewing under the surface of this anime masterwork that is hinted at from time to time, but only comes to fruition in the show's closing episodes.

 The cast of characters is fantastic, the violence is astonishing at times, the tone is as dark as they come, and the art is just awesome.  Griffith's lust for power and admiration of Guts are in many ways the series' focal point, but he remains a true enigma of a character right up to the very end.  The human drama, killer battles, and memorable cast are already enough to cement Berserk's status as a must-see anime, but the supernaturally-powered ending is what shoots this story to legendary status for me.  I haven't seen an ending so bold, dark, beautiful, and insanely batsh#+ since ""End of Evangelion"", an all-time anime benchmark.  Despite all of the hints and foreshadowing in the story, you will become so wrapped up in the rise and fall of The Band of the Hawk that you will not see what is coming; not by a longshot.  And when it all comes together, the result is something that will leave you breathless and amazed.",1189209600,2,2627,4.5456475583864115
1916182,5,B0000CABH8,"Berserk is one of the Best Animes around. The manga and the show. Keyword is ""show"" this is not a movie. Majority of people complain about the ending because they don't realize that its not a movie. Berserk series is a show. The ending is like the season finale of any other great show. Unfortunately Berserk was never renewed for a 2nd season (probably because some of the manga was cut for the show, and it would be difficult to continue without those scenes from the manga). The animation is good, no not cutting edge, but that contributes to the overall feel of the show. It gives it a raw feel. The story and character development is great. I advise you set aside some time to watch this show, because you will not want to turn away. Thats another reason the ending was not liked, it left everyone wanting more. Remember its a show, not a movie, it was never meant to wrap itself up in the end. If you want to find out what happens, go check out the manga (Vol. 13 is where the show stops), the story is still going on today.",1184198400,3,1030,4.287179487179487
1916193,5,B0000CABH8,"I've noticed that a lot of people are complaining that this doesn't have an ending.

Well, you're right. The last episode leaves much to be desired, which may upset a lot of people, but what most of these people don't understand is that the anime was made for one purpose. It wasn't created to tell the story of Guts and the rise of Griffith. No, it was made with the intent to draw fans to the manga. It was nothing more than a tool, and the ending is perfect in that regard. Everyone who watched Berserk immeadiately wants to know what happens to Guts and Casca, and they can by reading the manga(which is far superior in EVERY regard to the anime).

So if you're reading these reviews and you're thinking that, ""Hey, this must not be a good anime because it has a horrible ending. I'm not gonna look into it,"" then you'd be foolish. The anime is good in what it was made for, but the real prize is the manga itself.",1181088000,3,918,4.2701149425287355
1916194,5,B0000CABH8,"Everyone always complains how anime always leaves off without a hard lined clean cut ending (I hear it from my wife every time I watch one), but instead makes you think usually about some philosophical point the story is trying to convey. Berserk is not wholely different in that aspect, but viewers have to realize when they are watching anime, that it is only a small part of a story. Berserk covers the first 13 books in a series that spans 32 books now (and is still growing), and is a character background building storyline. (SPOILER COMING UP if you haven't figured this part out from other reviews) Granted the story goes off and switches abruptly over to a hellraising sacrifice, and blood bath battle, (however not without much forboding so it shouldn't really be a suprise) but that actually is nowhere near the end of the story, even as far as the DVDs go. The first episode takes place after the last episode and then eveything else is a flashback, so if the viewer doesn't expect everything to go to hell at the end then they would be a fool. Yes it would be nice to see how Guts got out of the sacrifice festival since it leaves the viewers on a cliffhanger, but since there is no season 2 and probably never will be, viewers either have to read the comics or speculate just like any other series that gets abruptly and unexpectedly canceled at the end of its first season.",1180828800,2,1388,4.490118577075099
1916195,4,B0000CABH8,"When it comes to Anime and Manga, I like to think of myself as moderately knowledgable.  I would not consider myself a hardcore fanatic, as I enjoy watching the TV shows and films, but only rarely delve into the backstory contained in the novels.  For this reason, I judge this DVD collection not by the Berserk story as a whole, but only by the merrits of the storyline actually contained in this collection of episodes.

Now, in terms of animation quality and sound, I am impressed.  It's not the same quality in terms of animation and sound as larger budget Anime movies, and don't expect the same quality as big budget TV series such as Ergo Proxy.  The animation is what you'd typically expect in a cartoon series, and it does not disappoint as long as you're not expecting an Appleseed level of refinement.  The only real non-storyline complaint I have, is that the labelling of the DVD's and the menu screens the DVDs contain are inadequate.

The storyline is where my main complaint with this series lies.  The vast majority of the included 25 episodes contain a storyline that is driven by themes of friendship, loyalty, and honor - along with undertones of romance.  The episodes that build on these themes, the first 23 by my observation, are absolutely fantastic.  The character development, the action, the paced adventure that follows the Hawks rise to power, is all done exceptionally well.  This story is so compelling that I would have considered this a masterpiece had the collection ended after episode 23.

Unfortunately, however, the concluding episodes move toward themes of Demons, causality, and hell-inspired revenge.  Perhaps if it were better explained, and had more time throughout the early series been devoted to this, it would have worked well.  However, how it is presented seems cheap and tacked on as an afterthought.  If you don't read some of the backstory in the novels, or perhaps get the abridged version on wiki, you'd be almost totally lost the last 2 episodes.  This is the one complaint I have about the series.  I loved the first 23 episodes, and consider them some of the best anime I've seen in terms of story and character development, but the last two episodes left a poor taste in my mouth, and almost ruined the rest of the series for me.

I've judged this series only by the story presented in it.  If you're a fan that intends to use this television series as a launching point into the Berserk novels, then this review will not be useful for you.  However, if you're only interested in this DVD collection for the story presented herein, then I must warn you - ignore the ending.",1178582400,5,2632,4.730263157894737

I would prefer to give the anime a 4.5 if there was one because the character Puck (also known as Pakk) was erased from the series.

If you have read the manga, you know that Puck is a VERY important character. ALso, if you have read the manga, this series (note: SEASON ONE) ends about 10 volumes into a massive 30+ volume manga. Ends on one hell of a cliffhanger too.

Berserk is by far one of the most intricate manga as well as anime in America and Japan. I really can't say anything bad about this series since i have been a fan for quite some time.

1916221,5,B0000CABH8,"Berserk, as a series, is one of those anime that starts out--at least after the first episode--slowly, and in many moments, boringly. It's essentially a character introduction in a series. We are dragged along by the will of the creators as they show us this massive, angry man named Guts. During the series, we learn of his willpower, his skill with the sword, and of his penchant for murder. Also, we meet two people intricately tied to him, Caska and Griffith, one a future lover, the other a future enemy. Odd thing is, it isn't that clear between the two which is which until about halfway through.

Berserk is a dark fantasy, literally. It takes place in a fantasy setting, often drenched in blood and dread, and men are constantly hewing other men in half with swords, spears, axes, or halberds. There are few morals beyond loyalty and brotherhood in battle, a moral found in every anime, TV show, or movie that deals with war. But the themes are there, and all of the them are dark, dealing mostly with murder, vengeance, and greed (or just about every one of the Seven Deadly Sins). But what's clear is that Berserk never tries to be anything else. It doesn't mislead you with slapstick, or with constant, giggly characters. The atmosphere is thick, and it never lets up. If you don't like the first episode, then you won't like the series. It immediately tries to scare away the faint of heart early on.

Though at times the animation quality could be better, the style here is a little different in that they follow few of the regular anime guidelines. Some of the characters have big eyes, but beyond that they are proportioned perfectly, giving the animation a sense of reality, which of course only adds to the intensity of the story. The animation gets a little better during moments of single combat, usually when Guts is swinging his sword, making the action scenes worth watching. Though rarely, they do recycle animation (moments that's found earlier on in an episode, like firing a volley of arrows, repeated in a later scene or after a commercial break), which can be off-putting at times. Most of this, though, is done in the earlier episodes, so it's easy to forget about.

Beyond that, other bonuses include a decent fantasy soundtrack that matches well to the mood of the scenes in the anime. Most of the characters are unique in some way to anime. And, though this can't really be considered a bonus for some, it has plenty of violence, enough to spread across two or even three different anime. So, if you like this in your anime, then here it is.

It's hard to recommend this anime because Berserk doesn't compare to many other fantasy anime, besides Record of Lodoss War.

1916233,5,B0000CABH8,"Berserk was one of the first anime I ever saw, and it was the one that really got me hooked on anime in general. That was several years ago (when I was sixteen or thereabouts), and Berserk still remains one of my favourite titles.

One of the things that I appreciated about it, aside from the intense animation and plot, was the fact that it made me appreciate a genre I might otherwise have passed off as a purely male thing. Berserk has its share of violence and gore and gratuitous blood spurting, but it also has drama and touches of romance and humour. (No, it's NOT shoujo, it simply has depth that a lot of violent series lack.) It's something that a girl of sixteen could enjoy wholeheartedly.

The outtakes are absolutely hilarious (I wish more animated series and films did them); if you've never heard 'Griffith' sing 'I'm Just A Girl Who Can't Say No,' it's worth it.

The only issue I have is with the packaging of this set. While I appreciate the slimmer design, a thinpak idea in the style of ADV would have been better than two discs layered on a card. It's really, really annoying having to take out discs to get to the one you want (and the ones on the front and back of the case are very difficult to remove, inviting damage).

If you get this, I recommend getting some slim DVD cases as well and doing away with the stock case. I've had some obnoxious DVD storage situations, and this one is just more trouble than it's worth.

This may well have been the worst ending I have ever seen in an anime, and that si saying a lot since they often have very obscure and unresolved endings.  The ending just blows, simple as that, terrible.  If you don't watch the last 3 or so episodes, then the series is pretty good.  Since the ending doesn't resolv eanything anywya, you won't really be missing out.",1128297600,9,437,4.4125
1916241,5,B0000CABH8,"This was an absolutely remarkable series.  The plot was very thick, which was my main fuel for support watching the entire dvd set.  The ending as everyone well knows leaves something to be desired, as far as understanding more and more through ANIME goes.  However, this is also a japanese manga that was created far before the anime and as far as I know is still an ongoing comic book.  Therefore you know by that alone that the story has merely just begun.

At first i thought the ending was kinda poor, and certainly didn't fill me in on the things i found most curious.  But then again, I can't think of any of my favorite animes that leave me COMPLETELY satisfied at the end.

*Ending aside, the series includes plenty of gore, adult content, and some nudity.  The action is non stop, and I would recommend this to ANYONE who has a respect and taste for anime, for this is among the best animes out there.  Fair warning, the action scenes combine moving animation with a lot of slide-show format, which isn't exactly my favorite but it suits some battles just fine.  One thing is for certain, after watching the entire first season it is impossible not to desire a 2nd season.",1127347200,2,1182,4.507042253521127

1916253,4,B0000CABH8,"Berserk started as a normal old anime. A man with a compelling enough story to have an anime after him. It continues along an awesome and compelling path throughout a war effort and explaining the main character's life and his choices. Though, underneith all this you can sense that something off is brewing. There are a few points the writers kept in mind throughout the whole story. But the diturbing and evil sub-plot is where the show starts to loose its cool. Everything boils down to the finale, which in my honest opinion sucked. The whole thing was fairly rushed to fit into three episodes. Not only that but it was completely and utterly disturbing. Everything about the ending messed with your mind. Not only that but there is a fairly disgusting scene of a demon raping the main character's girl friend and the main character chopping his own arm off to try to save her.",1121299200,3,881,4.653846153846154

1916256,5,B0000CABH8,"The first thing you may get out of hearing about Berserk is ""how good can something called 'berserk' be?""  To be honest, upon first hearing about the manga my brothers friend was reading, I was put off.  I had no idea until I saw the series how INCREDIBLY deep it was.  Guts may seem like a simple monster of a man who swings a big sword, but he quickly begins to peel away the layers that cover his true nature and it becomes clear that he is one of the great anime characters ever devised.

The story begins with a strange episode dealing with monsters.  After the first episode, we are thrust back into the early years of Guts' life (I believe the story of the series ranges from Guts being 17 years old to 21).  He is sought by a mercenary leader Griffith, who commands the Band of the Hawk.  Needless to say, he joins them and from there the viewer is thrown into the middle of an incredible, sprawling epic.  Huge battles ensue and characters perfectly compliment one another.  The way the episodes are put together, you can't just watch one episode in a sitting.  You are forced to continue it.  I watched the entire series in one sitting the first time, and since whenever I do watch it I have to do the same thing.  The story simply flows like water.  It is complete with action, adventure, political intrigue, philosophy, and even a love story. While the music in some parts really falls, like in the intro song, there are some great pieces that are repeated throughout.

One thing that must be pointed out it is called Berserk, and for that it has a lot of violence and even nudity.  However, it is toned down considerably from the manga.  As the series comes to a close, you find yourself saying ""Is that all?""  No.  In fact, the  series entrenches only about a third of the entire story thus far.  The manga is currently 29 volumes that run about 250 pages each.  The series is roughly volumes 4-14.  I suggest watching this series and then finding fan-translated scans of the manga, since only the first six are released in America.  Trust me when I say the story of Berserk is unputdownable.  The creator, Miura, states that he originally intended Berserk to be about 50 volumes, so even now it is hardly near completion.

Buy this boxed set.  You will be hard pressed to find a better anime series than this.",1118793600,28,2324,4.447867298578199

1916259,5,B0000CABH8,"Quick review. Awesome Series, many reviews have been written about this for the individual discs and the other version of the complete season 1 set (the $140 version). Only difference I find in this set is the new slimmer packaging, all six discs come in an interestingly economically designed pack (about as wide as say... a Lord of Rings Collectors set of Fellowship of the Rings). But, these ARE THE SAME discs with all the extras including the outtakes and production art.  One annoyance perhaps, the disc art is also the same, so there is no description of what episodes are contained on each disc... Just the title given to the disc when they were being sold individually.  Thought I'd write this since I couldn't find any other information on this set and what was already out there prior to its release.",1112140800,92,811,4.704225352112676

1916261,4,B0000CABH8,"Berserk is without a doublt the best anime ever next to Neon Genisis.  The show has characters you'll love, enemies you'll hate, love and compassion.  This had everything I loved about the series. It is a very dark and some what scary series.  It's very very disturbing also.  The best thing about this series are the characters that you'll fall in love with and of course......Gutts..

Spoiler ALERT..sort of*

Poor Gutts.  This guy has one of the most screwed up life ever.  You'll feel for this guy.  I mean what ever the poor guy does he always ends up paying for it.  He was given birth by his deceased mother(that is correct...deceased)and to make things worse, the man who took care of him tries to murder him and sadly Gutts was at the wrong moment at the wrong time.  Then to add some more to the ingriedeant he finally finds friends he can be with and finally share compassion with and see's them as his home and family(the hawks)but sadly they all get torn apart and eatin by demons.  Oh were not done yet, the woman he loves and has a child with(Caska)ends up getting raped and tortured by a demonic creature who was once human and his friend(Griffith).  But that's not over for Gutts yet...He slices off his own arm so he can prevent the rape of the woman he loves with no success of course and ends up losing his right eye to a demon.  Poor poor gutts.  SPOILER DONE..

Berserk is a very chilling series.  It's dark and not for many people who are looking for something fun and happy like Pokemon.  Berserk also has one of the most saddest, darkets and down right depressing endings ever.  I will assure you that on the last 10 seconds of the last episode as Gutts is walking down to his next destination to get vengance on those who put him through hell(literaly)you will get chills.  I will never forget that ending when he was walking down the desert with a close up on his face and you see nothing except his left and right eye(which is blinded cause of a demon).  Very chilling ending.

Berserk is also a very violent series.  It holds nothing back and has some really unsettling scenes(some involving his final moments with the Hawk on the last episode).  So if you have young one I don't recommend seeing this series as It is recommended to people ages 17 or up.  The series has a really great storyline, lots of twist and turns until the final episode.  Overall this series is awesome and I recommend it.

The reason I didn't give it a 5 is because of the way it ends.  But I will assure you that if you know a store that sells the manga go out and read them!  I have read all the way up to Vol 16 and the series is not getting pretty at all(not after what Gutts go's through on vol 13).  Overall Berserk is everything I want in a series and is not for the faint and weak ones.  In the end I give this amazing series a...

4.9 out of 5 stars.

Again this is recommended to a mature audience.  You could maybe compare this with Spawn(hey c'mon Al Simmons go's through just as much pain as Gutts)

1916262,5,B0000CABH8,"First of all for anyone who is not familiar with Berserk, it is based upon the japanese manga series.  the anime only goes up to volume 12 of the manga series.  the manga series is up to volume 28 and it is STILL GOING.  when people say that the anime has a bad ending...they really have no idea what they are talking about cause the story has not ended yet.  that ""ending"" that they are talking about is only the end of that chapter or volume.  the berserk story is the best story that i have been fortunate enough to have come across.  i really suggest getting the mangas which have been translated into english and are being published by Darkhorse comics.  currently the translated mangas are only up to volume 6.  but you can read them online if you go to thespectrum.net/berserk.  berserk is not only the best anime, but its the best manga and story EVER!!!",1099267200,8,862,4.405063291139241
1916273,5,B0000CABH8,"Berserk like so many Anime Series is an incomplete one.  The tales of Guts and his quest to destroy the Godhand were never told as this series was all buildup to that.

The series is basically the first set part of the story on how Guts eventually came to hate the Godshand and their hords of Demons.  The battles are violent and the story is actually very good (with good voice acting as well).  It plays off as more of a Fantasy epic that ends with a Holy S--- ending that leaves you craving more.  The story is very well told but sadly like so many other Anime series the full tales are never told as the series did not last past season 1.  Thus there is a major feeling of incompletness that can now only be fullfilled with the Mangas.  However what is here is an incredible series that combines wonderful story telling with gut wrenching violence.  Highly recomended.",1099094400,87,872,4.40625
1916274,3,B0000CABH8,"This was a pretty good anime but there are things that you should be aware of if you actually want to buy it. The first thing you will notice is that this series has so much camera pans in it that it sometimes feels like you are watching a still picture slideshow with voiceovers. The next annoying thing is the animation, which is pretty recycled and bad. With that said I will say that the storyline is addictive until about the last two or three episodes at the end of the series, when it basically turns from believable to fantasy/ ridiculous. Out of nowhere it seems like the story turns from something interesting and passionate to ..well, garbage. I have read some of the manga so I expected the series to be about this character named Guts fighting demons but it ended up being a 24 episode flash back. The mood was set through the whole series to be about war and friendship, love and growing up and then suddenly they switch from this mood (which was going very very well) to the mood of the manga which is different and it ends up spoiling all that was built up. Despite it being a flashback the history of the character is very interesting and it will keep you interested but if you were expecting a demon slaying action series there are only about 3 episodes of that, mostly it is human war. The good thing about the boxed set is the actual box which is done very good with great artwork and will make you want to keep it. I would suggest that instead of buying the whole thing, rent all of the episodes one time and watch them. It is interesting to see the story of these characters evolve but after watching it through once there is no real reason to want to see long pans, bad animation and the extremely poorly done conclusion over again.",1097452800,7,1755,4.370030581039756
1916275,5,B0000CABH8,"Berserk is a Gothic Fantasy in every sense imaginable.  Combining fantasy, horror, medieval warfare, great characters and even some humor into a terrific series.

The story is told from the point of view of Guts, a young mercenary with a tragic past.  From his point of view we watch the rise of Griffith... a man who's ambition could crush entire kingdoms in his quest from peasanthood to the throne of Midland.  Joining the Band of the Hawk under Griffith's leadership, Guts gains unwanted fame while others revel in it.  But there is a true sense of doom and dread as the dark secret behind Griffith's true destiny is revealed, centering around a demonic gift given to him long ago called the Behelit or the Egg of the King.

Based on the manga by Kentaro Miura, Berserk is a series not to be missed.  If you like it, be sure to pick up the manga as well.",1093046400,2,858,4.461538461538462

So artistic and beatifull full of desire and dreams,that are so motivational and inspiring that will change many perspectives in your life and will open many more. Recomended for all anime fans out there and people familiar with Nero and those Renasaunce fairs, got to love medievil times. Plus don't get mad at the ending its supposed to be that way its done on purpose,remmber the series isn't done thats not even half of the series so you have alot to look foward too :)",1092787200,2,544,4.505050505050505
1916277,5,B0000CABH8,"Ok, first off: Berserk is one of my favorite anime series ever. It's set in a dark gothic realm during a time of war and conflict. There is a LOT of blood, both complicated and direct adult themes, some cursing and some nudity. The other gripe is that the series is unfinished. It's based on a Manga that has not ended. If those things don't bother you, i cannot reccomend this series enough. The positives far outweigh the negatives in Berserk's case.

  The animation is great, good framerate... no re-used frames here. Sound and presentation are both fine as well. Berserk would be quite watchable just for the awesome battle scenes. Fortunatly, the series is more then just eye candy. The story is outstanding, filled with twists and turns, battlefield tatics and political plots. Though the story is great, the character interaction and development is truely outstanding. Indeed, the main reason of me writing this review is to clarify on the characters. I won't elaborate on them much, but if you want to figure them out all on your own feel free to stop reading.

  First off, none of the main characters are homosexual. Some people tend to think that about Griffith at first glance. The deal with him is that his ambition to rule totally consumes him. He doesn't care about friendship or love, he sees everyone and everything as tools and stepping stones on his climb to the top. He is posessed with that powerful dream, and will stop at nothing to make it become reality. His swordsmanship is masterul, his tatics brilliant. He is charismatic and displays a calm confidence that makes everyone around him expect success. Later in the series, his character continues to develop. I won't elaborate further.

  Gatsu is the main character. Berserk takes place in a tragic age, and Gats has certainly had his share. His childhood was traumatic to say the least, and throughout the series Gats seems to challange his very existence; charging headlong into the midst of the chaos, and attempting to retrieve his life from there. Gats' physical skills and extreme willpower allow him to do so. His sword is his best friend, and he will kick a lot of butt throughout the series. Gats desperatly tries to find his place in the world, and Griffith soon takes notice of his talents. Gats will play a role as Griffith's Vanguard leader, greatly assisting Griffith in his quest to live the dream... but what of Gats' own dreams?

  Caska is the main female character in the series. As pretty much the only woman in any army, she tries hard to fit in with the guys, and succeeds to a degree. Caska starts off as Griffith's top subordinate, and she has the skills to match the job. She is infatuated with Griffith because of past events, but the fact that he sees her in a military capacity instead of a personal capacity frustrates her. Everytime Griffith goes out of his way for Gats, it makes Caska resentful of Gats. She misses no opportunity to tell Gats what he did wrong but is actually quite shy when it comes to her own feelings of love. Gats' brashness clashes with her cautious correctness, ironically making them a great team. She will play a larger role later on...

  All these characters grow and develop as the series progresses. Not only that, but occasional flashbacks help you see part of the reason why the characters are the way they are. There are other great characters as well, including the too-nice Jideu, pessimistic Corkus and mysterious Zodd, among others. The setting may be highly fantasy, but these character's emotions are real enough to feel. I've seen a lot of anime, and in my opinion this is among the very top... certainly worth checking out...",1091145600,6,3676,4.739811912225705
1916278,5,B0000CABH8,"I don't write too many reviews, but this certainly warranted a write-up.  Excellent series, but not for the kiddies.  There are some very powerful themes happening here, including ambition, war, homosexuality(?), love, devotion, honor, rape, and consequences of one's choices...things which I'd say the under-13 crowd might not quite get or truly appreciate.  Also lots of blood...LOTS of blood...squirting all over the place in every episode, but this IS about a band of mercenaries during wartime, so what do you expect?  Some excellent humor that's absolutely perfect when it appears, but overall the series has a very serious tone (watch the outtakes on each DVD of the boxed set...they are a riot).  I have to agree with some comments that the ending is a bit frustrating, but it's a typical anime ending, and it actually loops on itself.  Episode 1 begins after the end ends...  One more thing: the music is great, both in the episodes as well as during the beginning and ending.  In other anime series, after several episodes I usually start skipping over the intro, but I never skipped this one once...it's got a toe-tapping fun about it.

Overall, it is a truly excellent series - gritty, real, honest, and brutal.  Not for the Sailor Moon crowd at all...but very well worth a watch.  I had to stop myself from watching the whole thing in one sitting.  And Guts' sword...gets bigger with every episode, but you'll have to see it to get the joke. :)",1090713600,2,1457,4.830645161290323

~Berserk~ The characters in this show ain't like nothin you ever seen. They have DEPTH! The most I have ever seen. But it is only 3 that has this DEPTH.
~Griffth~
~Guts~
~Caska~
because of the DEPTH to these 3 great characters is astonishing, everything these 3 characters do will be interpreted diffeerntly with every viewer that watches these 3 characters interact.
Here is a list of many things I mean............................
* Is Griffith and Guts really gay?
* Does Casca really love Griffith or is her judgement clouded for another man, maybe Guts?
* What caused Griffith to become gay?
* Who is the smarter man Griffith or Guts?
* Why is Casca always complainin?
* Does Guts want Griffith or Casca? Is he bisexual?
and there are many more. This series is everything just get it.

Beserk has an amazing set of characters and an awesome look. Fair warning, this is bloody stuff, there is no comprimise in the gore (which isn't normally done with tv anime) but that's one of the things I like about it, very gutsy for tv stuff. The plot leaves you wanting more and more, and to see what will happen to guts and the band of the hawk. The relationship between guts and his leader gets more interesting as the story moves along.

The story is about a man named Guts, who gets tangled up with a mercenary group and their leader Griffith's ambition to rule all Midland through war. The plot is very developed and keeps you interested and wondering what is going to happen next; it also takes a few twists you wouldn't expect. The music is melodic and haunting at the same time, that fits in with the story perfect. The character design is complex, with the charaters changing as they grow and experience different situations. There is some humor in the story but the series is about a war so don't buy this if you want humor. The reason I didn't rate this a 5 is because of the ending that leaves you wanting more, and there is no plan for their to be a second season. If you buy the series then in order to continue the story you have to want to purchase the manga, which takes up right after the story left off.

Guts is the strongest human fighter i ever seen, if you went to call a man who can lift a sword as big as he is and has a rage demon inside him. Berserk is different from other animes he has no real special powers he will simply cut you in half!
The story line is great nothing ever losing grip,and non stop action from beginning to end, perfect. I don't have to keep going on about him just buy BERSERK vol. 1 and u will see for your self how anime is done great. later",1081123200,,636,4.0
1916296,5,B0000CABH8,"Okay, I have been reading some fairly negative reviews about this series and thought I would provide some clarification on apparently the biggest complaint - the ending.  First of all, you have to understand that Berserk is a bi-weekly comic book published in Japanese and these DVD's are simply an animated version of the books that was playing late night in Japan.  The animation, if memory serves me correct, covers books 1 through 13 of the comics and ends there.  However, the comic books series continue much more (and even on-going as I write this today) and currently the comics are at 26!  So all I am trying to say is these DVD's should not be criticized for their ending because that is not how the story ends... the animation only ends and in the comics, Guts is adventures are continuing strongly.
But for many of you, who do not live in Japan or do not have access to the Japanese comics... here is a summary of what happens next (WARNING!  SPOILERS AHEAD!)
1.  After being rescued from ""hell"" by the skull helmed warrior, Guts and Casca are returned to the mountain where he trained after immediately leaving the Falcon Army.
2.  Caska has gone insane from her experiences and gives birth to a half demon child (who immediately disappears to reappear numerous times later).
3.  Leaving Casca, Guts sets out to hunt down the various disciples of God Hand and kills quite a few.
4.  Upon returning back home, he realizes that Casca has disappeared (wandered off) and he sets out on a quest to find her.
5.  During the quest, after defeating some disciples, he rescues Casca.  However, in the craziness surrounding the rescue, Gryphis returns to the normal mortal plane.
6.  Having a mortal body, Gryphic reforms the Falcon Army which is then used to defeat Midland from the invading armies of Kushan.
7.  Meanwhile, Guts, accompanied with Casco, a young witch, a thief, and a former inquistor and her body guard travel to find Gryphis.
8.  Guts get superpowered up by gaining a Dwarven Armor that makes him unbelievably strong (and it is hinted that this is the same type of armor worn by the skull helmed warrior).
  That is about where the comic ended today.  Anyways, I hope that this was of some help to some people but.. let me just say this, for those who loved the animation.. the comics are infinitely better.  People would not believe who ""tame"" the animation is compared to the comics...",1080864000,2,2410,4.670616113744076

Yeah. If you can stomach the terrible demon hentai at the end,this is a great purchase. The animation,although sometimes stiff,and inconsistent,has a certain charm to it,I guess. The characters are very memorable. The 'main character',Gatsu,has a terrible past and kills because it helps him forget. Caska is the tough female lead,who is jealous of Gatsu at first,but then gets feeling for him(stereotypical,I know,but just watch it).And,of course...Griffith...Yeah...At first he's your average bishonen with a small,curved blade,but he is VERY developed near the end of the series. You begin to feel sorry for him and hate him at the same time...Yeah. The music is mostly good.'Forces' is a great song,that fits. Sadly,you won't hear it much. The opening and ending songs are terrible. The Japanese voice actors are great. The plot is so deep,even if it is based off a small slice of the original Berserk manga. There's no real bad guy or good guy. All a beautiful grey...
Overall,if you can see past its BAD ending,this series is for you. Whether you're in it for either the deep plot,or the action,this is a must-buy.
WARNING:The series is VERY violent,and deals with certain subjects you may find uncomfortable. I think a mature 14 year old could handle it.",1077062400,,1654,4.868794326241135
1916298,5,B0000CABH8,"This is the best anime you can ever hope to invest your money on.
The story is about Friendship, Destiny, War, Will Power, and Love. There are 3 main characters, but a lot of support characters that you will care for. The main characters are Guts, Casca, and Griffith. It starts out as a mans journey to establishing his own kingdom, and a mans pointless life. This all leads to something beyond comprehension. This might sound corny, but trust me, it is nothing like that. I just don't want to give away anything that could ruin this masterpiece.
A little fantasy is involved in the anime. But there is enough of it at the first episode to distract anyone. My advice to you is to watch the first dvd and then pass judgment. The first episode is actually the last episode. But the whole series would have been MUCH better without it at all.
If you ever wanted to see what anime was all about. This is anime at it's best. Storyline wise. The graphics are average. The voice acting is one of the best. The extras include out-takes, which are some of the funniest things you can ever listen to.
If you like Berserk. You should buy the Manga. The anime is actually one arc from the manga (vol 5-12 or around that). The manga expands the story.
Other good anime recommendations:
- Neon Genesis Evangalion
- Kenshin: Trust and Betrayal
- FLCL (Fooly Cooly)
- Trigun
- Cowboy Bebop",1075593600,3,1374,4.47808764940239
1916299,5,B0000CABH8,"This is the best anime series I have watched. Each characters is moving in his or her own way, it has a great story, and though many complain about the artwork...I liked it. Berserk is a must buy for anyone that likes anime. It is a mature anime. It has a lot of blood, a tiny bit of nudity, and some cussing. It's basically like a rated R movie. However, please don't let that turn you away from it. I suggest you should be at least over the age of 16 to watch this and if you do...you will have a grand time. You will learn to love every character in this anime and eventually hate some of them as well. GO OUT AND BUY THE ANIME and the MANGA!
Have a good time fellow shoppers

1916300,5,B0000CABH8,"Berserk is one of the most unique animes, and just plain one of the most unique stories around. It has a flow and style of plot and character development all its own. The characters are all very realistic and never seem flat or predictible. Guts, himself, is a very different manner of hero. He's far from a moral character, yet not really what you would call an antihero. The story is very subtle at times and does a nice job of juggling action and helping further the narrative, with bits of dialogue that never seem stilted or generic.
The ending, as many reveiwers have already said, is very brutal and quite cruel. Some may be turned off by this, but I found the ending quite a bold move, and upon watching the last two episodes over again, prefer it to a more upbeat one. One of the most standout points I found throughout the series was its music. It's quite beautiful and matches the tone of the series perfectly, especially in the latter episodes. Perhaps the most surprising to me was the brialliant use of cuts and edits the series employs. Whether it goes to its commercial bumper or just recaps the events of the previous episode in the prologue, the series has a sharp eye for cliffhangers and last-minute revelations. Treat yourself to something fresh in the anime world and watch Berserk, you shouldn't be dissapointed.",1073001600,14,1335,4.637130801687764
1916301,5,B0000CABH8,"First off, this is in my opinion the best anime out there.  Most anime have cool fighting scenes and whatnot, but this one has blood.  If you like sword-slashing, head-smashing, bloody good old fun, here you go.  Plus, you know how in some, if not all, anime have those goofy characters that irritate you by their crazy emotional expressions (big eyes, big tear drops, making weird facial ""cartoonish"" expressions)?  Well, you won't find any such characters here.  This is all serious.  In every DVD episode you will see bloody fighting.  And to add to that, the story is good.  Every episode builds to the final episode.  Some argue about the final episode.  But if they were not lazy and read the comic that continues the Berserk series, they will see how it all makes sense.
Anyway, when I said ""Best Buy"", I also meant that's where you should get it.  I ordered from Amazon.  Took like a week or so to get (despite Winter Holiday traffic).  But the DVD was scratched.  I complained and Amazon sent a whole replacement set within 2 days.  That was cool.  What wasn't cool was that I found the Berserk DVD set at Best Buy for forty dollars cheaper than Amazon price.  Or if Amazon edits this message, lets just say it was way cheaper in other stores.
But Amazon will take care of you if you order through them.

My only complaints are the production values are a little lacking in this in terms of limited animation in parts and stills during busy shots, but the story is solid and it will grip you until the shocking end. This anime is NOT for kids (and not for the faint of heart), but is highly recommended to anyone who likes anime or medieval tales with a hint of the terrors that lay beyond (in hell, demons, otherworldly beings, etc).

This story is an excellent commentary on what it takes to gain power.  It is truly heartwarming, heartbreaking, and terrifying in parts.  So ... why wouldn't you watch it?",1394150400,,650,4.577586206896552
