7429034,4,B0154XVKNS,"Pamela Smart has now been in prison for over 25 years, and still contends she is innocent.

This is a recounting, and analysis of ""perception"", since this was such a highly publicized case, and the first to be televised.

It deals with the question, did the overwhelming media coverage ""create"" a negative image that was impossible for Ms. Smart to escape, leading to her conviction, and still impacting her ability to effectively pursue any recourse?

It brings to mind, another case, highly publicized in Australia, of a young Australian woman going on vacation, arrested in airport customs in Bali, when her body surfboard bag proved to also contain 9 pounds of marijuana. She was convicted in 2005, and is still serving her 20 year sentence.

Because she was such a pretty young girl, with no criminal record, it became a media storm in Australia, that lead to a young businessman taking on her cause at his own expense, but to no avail.

This was kind of the opposite side of the coin with regard to the Smart case, where the public was deluged with negative images of her.

Did a 15 year old boy, shoot and kill Smart's husband, of his own planning, and engage two friends as accomplices?  Was the fresh faced Australian girl really stupid, or desperate enough to try to smuggle marijuana into a country with such harsh drug laws?

In both theses cases, the audience has to decide if the women are guilty, or just VERY good liars.",1447891200,3,1436,4.670634920634921
7429035,5,B0154XVKNS,"Though this film was made in 2013  then aired on HBO and apparently played a lot of film festivals  it is just making its DVD release in November 2015. I was provided an advance screener in exchange for an honest review.

I remembered the news stories of the murder trial involving 21-year old school district employee Pamela Smart who allegedly seduced a 17-year old student to murder her husband (of one year) with the help of two friends. What I didn't realize (until I viewed the bonus feature on this DVD, was that this was the first trial ever aired live on US television from gavel to gavel. This was one year BEFORE the infamous trial of O.J. Simpson.
Using LOTS of archival footage and sound recordings and recent interviews with many involved in the case  including Smart, who is still serving a life sentence in prison  Director Jeremiah Zagar provides enough info for anyone who may not remember the case up to date. Though we know the outcome for Smart, most folks don't know the update on the teens who actually committed the murder. This trial in the small New England town was actually TVs first reality TV series and Zagar lets it play out in sequence in the 98 minute documentary, which was produced by HBOs Documentary Films.  Its fascinating to watch. Because it is a mystery of sorts, I will not provide any spoilers here.  I will say that if you like crime dramas this will appeal to you.

When I first received the DVD I hadnt noticed the name of the Director. But then I realized this was the Jeremiah Zagar who is the son of Philadelphias legendary mosaic artist. Isiah Zagar, and whose first film was about his dad and family growing up in the South Street area of Philadelphia. The whole Zagar family grew up in my neighborhood and all  except for Jeremiah  still live in my neighborhood.

The DVD contains the theatrical trailer for the film as well as a nine-minute Q&A with Zagar at the Hot Docs film festival. A few facts are revealed here that were not in the film so I found this a very useful addition to the package.

At the end of watching the film you will still be left with the question, Did she or didn't she? but it will also give you reason to wonder about the power of reality TV and sensationalistic TV news coverage to garner ratings.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

7429038,3,B0154XVKNS,"Pretty good, showed mostly the side how the media and others influenced the trial. The part she did not have enough of money, to hire a top-notch defense team is believable too. After all of these years in prison, it is time to release her. The shooter and his cohorts have been released. Time for her to go too, been 25 years. Realistically, doubt if that will ever happen. Too famous of a case and way too many politics involved in this one.",1479513600,4,443,4.349397590361446

7429040,5,B0154XVKNS,"I remember watching much of the trials back in the day. What this documentary does quite well, in my opinion, is spotlight how the media affected the possible outcome of the trials. It WAS a circus and as a young girl, I too was convinced of Pamela Smart's guilt. While I still lean more towards guilty, I must admit I am not quite as sure as I used to be. That said, I do not feel it was fair that she was tried by the public even before the trial began.

A good Food-for-Thought documentary.",1470268800,7,493,4.189473684210526
7429041,2,B0154XVKNS,"I found this documentary to be very slanted. The basic message was faulting media coverage for the ultimate guilty verdict in this case.  There is certainly an argument to be said that the jury should have been sequestered. However, I am left believing that she was undoubtly the mastermind in this murder and belongs behind bars.

Her own testimony was not believable in explaining the tapes... I also find a police conspiracy unbelievable in this case. She obviously didn't do herself any favors in her behavior after the murder. I also find it hard to believe that a short affair would leave a teenage boy (even a criminally inclined one) to commit this murder. Especially a month after the first botched attempt. Sometimes the devil is in the details and I find it especially hard to believe that those boys decided on their own to lock her small beloved dog in the basement away from the murder scene.

It should be of note that the boys quietly served their time as model inmates and have been released. Some say this is injustice as Pamela serves a life sentence. I say justice was found in this case. It is important to note the role of media in this case while realizing the one person who reveled in it most was Pamela herself.",1457568000,5,1237,4.588235294117647

7429043,1,B0154XVKNS,"I was very disappointed in this ""documentary"". I found it trying to be dramatic but mostly was fluff.
 Pam's explanation of why she called Cecilia was laughable. Even if she was on anti depressants, there is no way the viewer can believe that she was THAT stupid. I deal with the public every day and I deal with some very very stupid people, I have not come across anyone that would be stupid enough to call Cecilia supposedly knowing that she was wired.. At the time Pam was a college graduate, now she has 2 masters degrees and one of her teachers claims that Pam is one of the most intelligent people that she has ever taught. (A little slip in the editing room?)
 Also she claims to not having the money for an audiotape expert and that is why the tape evidence was so damaging.  The evidence was damaging because of what she said. She was caught. Also, in watching this I really did not believe the ""no money"" excuse. If it was that important her family could have raised the money.
The ""juror #13"" tapes were just not believable to me. Why after all this time will the juror not reveal herself? Was she on the panel that found Pam guilty or was she an alternate? If she was on the jury why was there a unanimous guilty verdict? Is there any way to prove that the tapes were made during the trial and not after?",1451520000,5,1317,4.30241935483871
7429044,3,B0154XVKNS,"Sadly, this film does not serve the interests of people who are unjustly convicted of crimes they did not commit. I was hoping to find some contrary evidence in the Pamela Smart trial, but there really aren't any. This woman is a sociopath who manipulated young men to murder her husband. The most compelling thing in the film, in terms of casting shadows on her guilt, are the recordings of one of the jurors who ultimately found her guilty. If anything, I think that this movie is worthwhile in terms of exploring the justice system and its use of plea bargaining in acquiring testimony. I really believe that there are countless numbers of people unjustly imprisoned, and I was hoping that this movie would enlighten viewers to this reality.",1448928000,6,744,4.775193798449612
8732681,2,B0154XVKNS,"This documentary was not incredibly cohesive so at times it feels convoluted and slow but still a good watch if you are at all interested in the case.  It is however, extremely frustrating to see so much time, energy and resources wasted on a person who is clearly guilty.  There are a lot of cases out there where people have obviously been wrongfully convicted or at least have had a controversial verdict that requires more discussion.  But Pamela Smart?  While the wiretap evidence is flawed, even Pam does not dispute the things she said that pointed to her guilt.  Her reasoning is completely laughable and silly.  And I am not at all moved by the fact that she has ""steadfastly maintained her innocence"" all these years.  Who wouldn't?  She has no chance of parole.  Why would she ever admit to this?  I think this filmmaker should dig deeper and look into some more cases, there are plenty of people out there who need more awareness brought to their case.  Bottom line, while the media did treat her unfairly, it does not change anything  She received a fair trial and is sitting where she belongs.",1535673600,,1107,4.649484536082475

8732684,1,B0154XVKNS,"A desperate and sad attempt to create a West Memphis Three type movement of her innocence. That doesn't work when she's guilty. They only interviewed her and not other people involved in the crime, so it was biased to begin with. They weakly tried to discredit any witness.

This isn't a study of the media, it's trying to clear a guilty woman, and doing it poorly.",1500768000,,365,4.53030303030303
8732685,2,B0154XVKNS,"I almost fell asleep trying to watch this poorly filmed documentary. I had never known of this story as a true one, I had only seen the movie with Nicole Kidman and thought it was fiction. I remember being very upset by the movie but this documentary left me confused. That does make sense, because real life is so complex and when it's depicted it is confusing. Whereas fiction as a film is the author's or screenwriter's imagination portrayed convincingly by good actors.",1500595200,,473,4.710843373493976
8732686,4,B0154XVKNS,"I honestly have no idea if Pamela Smart is guilty or not. To a large degree though that isn't what this movie is about. What this documentary is about is how media presence can directly or indirectly effect the justice system. Everything from what photo is used in a newspaper to how the camera is angled to sit in a court can inadvertently influence how we are processing information. A camera's presence can change the way witnesses and even the judge will behave while the trial takes place. And interestingly, when the trial is big enough, the made for tv movies and reenactments that follow can even change how witnesses remember the course of events.

We live in an age where all information is readily available at our finger tips. What Captivated asks is, can we always trust what we see?",1499212800,3,796,4.6453900709219855

8732689,1,B0154XVKNS,"Pathetic attempt to cloud the reality that Smart was recorded on tape aknowledging her guilt. There are no dots connected between the massive media coverage and an unfair finding by the jury. There is also no significance to the tape of the juror's personal thoughts put to tape regarding the media coverage.
The film may serve a purpose in studying the face of a genuine sociopath, wide eyed lying straight into a camera. Over the years, she has changed her admission only to being guilty of having the affair. Had she been willing to take a plea like the boys did and actually admit what she did, she may also have been out in twenty years. She could never do this-then, or now.  It's chilling to watch. Just pure evil.
