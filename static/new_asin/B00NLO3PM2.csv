6667077,5,B00NLO3PM2,"Need to get a conversation started with family and friends about how to love people who are different then the norm?  Boy!  This is an awesome place to start!  Beautifully crafted, the film is an art piece by itself....but they way it just tells the stories - there is no judgment - there is only love.  A poignant reminder of how to love when you don't agree - and how to stand up in love in support of others when they are mistreated.  Fantastic film!!!",1459987200,4,455,4.305882352941176
6667078,4,B00NLO3PM2,"For some it is at first disappointing that there were no 'brown' faces, but do not let this dissuade you from immersing yourself in this important piece of human-rights and heaven-rights work. It is a sound observation that Jesus made a point of embracing those that were rejected and pushed to the fringed edge of society. Inclusionary behavior is promoted.",1456012800,7,358,4.983333333333333
6667079,5,B00NLO3PM2,"Powerful and moving film about three couples wrestling with their identify and faith. I have seen this film with multiple groups and each time everyone in the room comes away transformed. The beauty of what the directors have done, is that they do not take a position on homosexuality or faith, but simply ask the viewer to walk in the shoes of someone else. The reactions of those in the center of the story, their family, and their faith communities is compelling and fascinating. At times the film will make you laugh, and at other times it will move you to tears. Everyone - Christians, members of the LGBTQ community, and those watching from other faiths - can use this film as an interesting case study in how we can all learn to have empathy and compassion for one another, regardless of our perspectives.",1444867200,6,812,4.645833333333333
6667080,5,B00NLO3PM2,I am a Seventh-day Adventist and it is very refreshing to have one's story told this way. I could identify with almost everything the folks in the film were experiencing. These are not actors. They are the actual folks telling their stories via interviews. The movie is not designed to be entertaining. It is a documentary. I highly recommend this film for anyone who is Seventh-day Adventist/Christian and who has LGBTQ family or friends.,1490140800,4,439,4.945945945945946
6667081,5,B00NLO3PM2,"I loved the film.  It is a great way to begin the conversation around homosexuality and spirituality, particularly in the Adventist faith tradition.  I love the movie because the LGBTIQ community that I am a part of are not often heard from.  The only voices heard are those professing being ""cured"".  However being born LGBTIQ is not a desease, but a gift from God.  I thank the producers for giving another glimpse of our community.",1490140800,2,434,4.733333333333333
6667082,5,B00NLO3PM2,"Most faithful members of conservative denominations have very little knowledge of, and almost no personal acquaintance with, LGBTQ people, and often pride themselves in wanting nothing to do with such ""sinners."" This film does a great service to all such conscientious Christians by introducing them to three gay couples who also are seeking to live godly lives even as they acknowledge their same-sex orientation. Many Christians may doubt that there can be such a person as a sincere follower of Jesus who lives with a same-sex partner. Without a single word of narration or a note of music, Seventh-Gay Adventists doesn't try to persuade or judge but simply takes us into the day to day lives of real people trying to live good lives. A great introduction to a world that many of us Christians know hardly at all, but one that our Christ may be calling us to enter with His love.",1490140800,2,882,4.771241830065359
6667083,5,B00NLO3PM2,"Very insightful, especially for those wanting to understand how faith and sexuality intersect in conservative religions. I loved hearing peoples stories and their authenticity inspired me. I've watched, rewatched and shared with many.",1490140800,,234,6.121212121212121
6667084,1,B00NLO3PM2,"I am a former Seventh-Day Adventist with family still actively part of the church. My father who recently passed away came out as gay several years after the divorce. He was an active member of the church: involved in Sabbath School, the church music group & much more. After he came out as gay he was told he was not welcome any longer. In defense of Seventh-Day Adventist Church I will say that they are not a cult. Certain SDA Conservative beliefs are (Their views on the Pope/Catholicism) on the fringe but every religion has people like that. All I'm saying is if you call it a ""cult"" from your holier-than-thou throne than so is every other religion.",1489881600,2,656,4.567796610169491

6667089,5,B00NLO3PM2,"This is an amazing film that will start honest conversation and transform lives. It will help people from more traditional, Christian backgrounds see LGBT folks as simply human, and it will also help people from secular backgrounds understand the importance of faith for so many.",1459987200,6,279,5.222222222222222
8678904,5,B00NLO3PM2,Very nicely done and very touching. I bought the download of this video a few years ago but wanted the DVD to share with others.,1522800000,,128,4.16
8678905,3,B00NLO3PM2,"It's really surprising that religion has not kept up with medical advances.  The prohibitory stances are based on biblical verses written thousands of years ago, Before medical science existed.  I learned many years ago that religionists are NOT Christians.  Christ was all inclusive. Religionists only want to control people.  There was a study several years ago, that attempted to learn how many of those who profess Christianity, actually were Christians.  They found that only about 3% really were Christian.  Makes one think doesn't it?",1522368000,,541,5.380952380952381
8678906,4,B00NLO3PM2,"This is a film for people who feel a need for religion in their lives. I was born Catholic, but when rules did not make sense I started questioning them. I have no use for religion. I studied history and saw how religion was used to keep the populace ignorant docile in exchange  for wealth and power I felt sorry for the poor gay guy going through five years of pray the gay away. that's what  Hitler did. get them when young and you have them for life",1521676800,,453,4.136363636363637

8678908,4,B00NLO3PM2,The issue of faith colliding with acceptance for people who do not fit the stereotype.  The ultimate message is slightly sanitized to appeal to a very conservative and straight audience but that is also clearly the aim of the film makers - to get their worthy message across to the more conservative members of society without too much shock value.,1496620800,,348,4.8
8678909,2,B00NLO3PM2,"I watched it through, though I really had to ask myself why.  These people really agonized over their lives, which is probably why I suffered myself to watch through it, and I felt for them, I truly did.  But I also had to wonder why didn't any of them bother to seek a Gay-positive therapist, especially the one young man whose parents, he says, spent ""thousands and thousands of dollars"" on the so-called ""ex-Gay therapy"" (thich is not therapy, but is more like organized torture, and should never be allowed in ANY state).  They make the claim that their Seventh Day Adventist community is so closed and so different, but is it really?  I know quite a few, and they aren't so different from most other Christians, not really.  Try coming out as a Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual or Transgender person when you grow up in an Orthodox Jewish family, or a Muslim family, a Hindu or Sikh family, then you know what true struggle is.  Try finding a Gay male relationship when you have belong to a true minority religion, like I do (I belong to a very smal sect of Sikhism, of which there are 32 sects, even though it is the newest religion on the planet, only 500 years old), and fortunately we do not have to adhere to the traditional standards of wearing the turban, groing foot long beards, etc., it still is not easy when we are strict vegetarians, spend 3 hours a day in religious practices, etc.  Then tell me how difficult your life is.  These people are such wimps.  The two women raised two daughters.  I had 5 children, and no one to help.  The movie was just a parade of whiners, and honestly, will only be of interest to people who want to whine and cry along with them.",1494806400,8,1671,4.428104575163399
8678910,5,B00NLO3PM2,"This film is groundbreaking. For the first time Seventh-day Adventists have (unofficially) explored the complex issue of homosexuality, especially as it relates to the church. The film features no ""experts,"" no talking heads, just authentic Christians coming to terms with something that generally receives only condemnation from other Christians.
The subjects interviewed are all relatable; they are people who may very well attend the same church we do. The filmmakers did a great job of letting them tell their own stories in their own words.
Christians of other denominations will find this film helpful in generating discussion about the church's proper role in dealing with homosexuality.",1490140800,,694,5.556603773584905
8678911,5,B00NLO3PM2,"I've seen this several times, shared it with family and friends...it's an honest conversation that I would hope will increase communication not only within our church, with also friends and families.  Most SDA's if I may say still live in a little bubble and may not interact with anyone who is LGBTQ...it's an incentive to just be open and listen.  Just because we are LGBTQ doesn't mean we don't believe and continue to believe in God and church as a connection to network with others who believe.",1490140800,3,499,4.724137931034483
8678912,5,B00NLO3PM2,"This film is a very helpful resource for those who are just beginning to question the issue of homosexuality, either in themselves or in a friend or loved one. It tells the stories of one lesbian and two gay couples who are faithful members of the Seventh-day Adventist Church, and the difficulties they face in a church that has not yet recognized the truth about sexual variations. The film makers show an empathetic attitude toward the very human situations described by the film characters as they face the problems of daily life and struggle to reconcile their spiritual and sexual orientation. Highly recommended.",1490140800,,619,5.019417475728155
8678913,5,B00NLO3PM2,"This film fills a real need in the Seventh-day Adventist community.  The LGBT community has been seen in a very negative light as sinners based on a few biblical texts.  While many denominations have moved to a more welcoming stance, Adventist leadership has refused to move forward with the current medical and legal positions regarding homosexuality.  This film puts faces to the ""issue"" and helps viewers to see the real life challenges and deep love between the couples in the film. A must see for any Christian who is willing to view with a desire to treat everyone as a ""neighbor"".",1490140800,7,587,4.792079207920792
