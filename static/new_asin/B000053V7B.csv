7930034,5,B000053V7B,"Seen this movie on Showtime late at night long time ago and finally found it on Amazon and
bought it used.
This is my favorite type of movie where a killer is the ""good"" guy and takes out bad guys and you
have red team taking out serial killers it's a fun little B movie if you like these type of movies.",1421193600,,304,3.9193548387096775
7930035,3,B000053V7B,"While I don't feel this movie is as bad as others, I must admit there's a lot of plot holes and the direction is a little tepid considering the subject.  Cathy Moriarty, who I think looks like a K-Mart Faye Dunaway, pouts and arches her eyes, but doesn't bring a lot of depth to her character, even when she confronts Muldoon with why the red team is doing what it does.  I think Patrick Muldoon does fine as the agent, and continues to be the new stud of Direct to Video movies.  Tim Thomerson and Fred Ward are commendable as well, and I didn't even recognize C. Thomas Howell as the bald serial killer.
This certainly won't set the standard for serial killer films, but it's entertaining.",1074470400,2,691,4.425196850393701
7930036,1,B000053V7B,"You would think that someone who is writing a movie about serial killers and law enforcement agencies would spend some time researching the subject. Obviously, whoever wrote the script for this did not.
Anyone with even minor knowledge of police or military tactics would laugh at the antics of the ""red"" team of the movie's fictional government agency, who're supposed to be some sort of elite anti serial-killer organization. If a real officer or operative acted in the manner they did, they'd probably get themselves and their colleagues killed in their first encounter.
And what were they thinking casting Cathy Moriarty to play the female agent? She's ugly, and it's a good thing they didn't let her take off her clothes. My deepest sympathy goes out to Patrick Muldoon who had to suffer through two love scenes with that pig. At least they were short.",990835200,5,857,4.917241379310345
7930037,5,B000053V7B,"An excellent dark thriller.  From the first creepy minutes voyeuring into the private behavior or a very weird guy, the off-beat, edgy tone is set. From there the plot takes off - serial killers are suddenly being knocked off.  Who's killing the serial killers?  An unlikely but effective pairing of detectives, Patrick Muldoon and Cathleen Moriarty are assigned to this weird case.  They're not quite sure if they want to send a thank you note to the killer or pursue the leads. C. Thomas Howell sure isn't the old ""Ponyboy"" we knew and loved from ""The Outsiders.""  He's dark, brooding, scary and works in a flower shop, of all things. It's surprising the blooms don't wilt.  I wouldn't let him touch my bouquet. Tension mounts as the search for the killer continues amid a freezing, wintry backdrop that adds to the cold-blooded business of homicide investigation.  Great mood setting.  And the ending is a real shocker! Can you guess it kept me perched on the edge of the couch and anxious?  I double-checked the door.",982972800,10,1021,4.788571428571428
