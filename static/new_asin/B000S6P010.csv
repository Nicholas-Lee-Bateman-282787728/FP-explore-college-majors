8204548,5,B000S6P010,"I was aware of this video for years, but didn't buy it thinking I could just record my own rhythm tracks instead.  However, there is a lot more to this DVD than I expected.  It has each song in multiple tempos, multiple variations on the melody, and good rhythm examples -- more than just strumming.  You'd spend a lot of time putting this together yourself.",1357689600,,358,4.476923076923077
8204549,5,B000S6P010,"I had to add a review to counter the negative ones here.  So I'll start by saying straight out that using this DVD has improved my flatpicking in a way nothing else has.  It's true that there is no tablature, and according to the reviews here the tabs on the website have errors.  So this is not the product to buy if you're wondering what fiddle tunes on guitar are all about and want to start learning them.  For that, buy Steve Kaufman's Parking Lot Pickers series.  This DVD offers something different:  a jam partner.  You can't really learn to play this music by practicing by yourself.  It's group music, made for jamming.  Using this DVD, I have learned how to jump in to take my solo, switching back and forth from rhythm to lead.  I've also gotten faster and surer in my playing.  I'm still a relative beginner at this--I know maybe 15 flatpicking tunes in beginner versions, and can't play that fast yet.  That's where the four speeds on this DVD come in.  The slow speed is perfect for practicing a tune to perfection, especially when it's new, and it's slow enough that I can take risks and try to improvise a little.  The slow/medium speed is perfect for getting into a relaxed groove and learning to nail a tune at a decent tempo.  The medium/fast (for me) is just a little faster than I can play well--so I learn how to make mistakes and keep going.  Also, it's WAY better than using a metronome for pushing yourself to play faster--with a band behind you, you really feel the music and can play faster and better.  The fast speed is way beyond me, but that gives me room to grow, and those of you who are more experienced players will feel right at home in it.  Bottom line:  for the first time, I can sit alone playing in my basement and really be playing this music instead of just practicing it.  One final comment about the tablature:  there is a LOT to learn here by watching Brad play.  Tab is a helpful guide, but it can also be a crutch.  I've already picked up a couple of things from Brad's playing, and I look forward to learning more as I improve.  He often incorporates a bluesy feeling that will be fun to learn, and he's a great crosspicker too.  There is a lot of tablature out there.  Here's a chance to learn the traditional way, by watching and listening and playing along.",1317772800,,2309,4.386792452830188
8204550,5,B000S6P010,"Yeah..I know there's no tab or notation with them. But you can find tab and notation for all these songs in any bluegrass book and online. The point of these DVD's is to show you how to switch from Rhythm To Lead and Jam along and since ""time waits for no man/women"" you will learn at slow and medium and high speeds how to do quite a number of songs and get used to finding your way right off when you screw up ... and believe me you will screw up. Staying in time after screwing up is the hard part of playing with a group, so when you get to a parking lot jam, at least you'll fit in if you can play 1/4 note versions, simple rhythm accurately and keep your timing.  Speed and fancy will follow if you keep at it.

Go get the simplest 1/4 note versions of these songs and just play along and learn the basic chords and do basic rhythm till you have them down. Then learn other versions with 1/8 notes and hammers and pull-offs and slides etc. on the leads and try to make better rhythms...watch Brad closely for some really cool rhythm stuff. If you can get thru 90% of these tunes  with ease with few mistakes, you can then rate these videos as not worth it...if you can't, they will do wonders for your timing and ability to play with others, however with others you will play more rhythm as the banjo and mando and violin and dobro and even the bass make take a break...so this is not the end of the line and rhythm that remains the same get's boring...just ask me, as I play mostly bass and find I have to get ""inventive"" to not go to sleep. To that end, I've asked Dan Miller of FlatPick Mag to speak to Brad about teaching a lot of rhythm tracks in the manner of Davis's various rhythms and putting them on DVD's. Dan thought it might be a good idea, but Brad's a busy guy...so meanwhile I listen to Brads rhythms, Wyatt Rice's, Steve Kaufman's and a number of others to try to pick up as many techniques as I can to un-bore me and to suit the band as each player demands that you do something that compliments that instrument in sound level and style played.  It's an endless battle...but a good rhythm player with good timing trumps fancy leads from my book.

I await Brad's rhythm DVD's but I'm not holding my breath...but if they show up, they will be a gold mine of great things to play even if you only copy Brad...but you will find you will mix and match with all that you've leaned, out of boredom if for no other reason.

8204551,1,B000S6P010,"Brad Davis is great player and these are great arrangements. However, they come with no tablature. Tablature is available from a download site, but is not available for all versions, and the versions that are available are filled with errors. In addition to numerous small error there are serious conceptual errors. In particular, whoever did the transcriptions didn't seem to understand the concept of a pickup beat. Thus the marked measures and chord changes come one beat too early in many of the tunes. This gave me a terrible time for about 6 months - I thought my playing was awful and that I couldn't get the synchronization right even to play backup chords. Once I figured out what was going on, I was so P.O.ed that I decided not to use them anymore, even though I finally figured out how to correct them. Unless you can play by ear, or are proficient enough to be able to catch and correct the errors, I would not recommend these.",1267833600,2,940,4.601190476190476
8204552,1,B000S6P010,You do not want this unless you like to suffer. I say suffer because Brad is an awesome player  but there is no tab and what is on the website is very limited and the one transcription that I checked by slowing down the music had numerous errors. I have seen a sample of Kenny Smith's book and that looks a lot better. One thing that could have made this better was to have the option to turn off the mandolin and rhythm guitar which would facilitate me figuring it out but of course they didn't do this.,1262649600,,504,4.142857142857143
