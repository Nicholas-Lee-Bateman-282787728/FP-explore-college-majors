8667081,4,B00LO1T55A,"I love found footage films. This one is very inventive and quite smart, not everything is spoon fed to the audience. Lots of subtleties, dark humour and a great, gory pay off. I read in the other review that it was apparently produced for $3000 or there abouts, all I can say is that i'm impressed especially considering the budget of something like Transformers.",1414713600,,363,4.6875
8667082,3,B00LO1T55A,"This film already has one -- very brief -- review, by someone who's not reviewed anything else. And 5 stars, no less! Hard to believe he isn't connected with the film.

I was sent a review copy of this film over a year ago. It's entertaining enough, but not 5 stars. Three stars is generous.

Legend Of The 5ive is yet another ""found footage"" film about ghost hunters who stumble upon the real thing. A very common subgenre these past five years, the best of which remains&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Spirit-Stalkers/dp/B00B4JYJM6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Spirit Stalkers</a>. Also pretty good is&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Feed/dp/B00EY8LSM8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Feed</a>. There are some lesser ones.

Legend Of The 5ive concerns an English woman who's shooting a documentary about TV ghost-hunters. So you have a filmmaker making a film about filmmakers. This means the ""found footage"" is shot from various camera angles. That's better than some ""found footage"" films that rely on only one camera, as it makes for a more dynamically edited film.

As it happens, these TV ghost-hunters are investigating a field that's reputedly haunted by the ghost of a witch. Yes, The Legend Of The 5ive bears strong similarities to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Blair-Witch-Project/dp/B00343NRPA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Blair Witch Project</a>. But there is a fresh angle about several strangely-clothed bodies that were found in this field several centuries ago. The origin of those bodies (when we learn it) is imaginative, but you must pay close attention to ""get it."" I didn't, until my second viewing.

Legend Of The 5ive makes some wise lighting choices. Like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Blair-Witch-Project/dp/B00343NRPA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Blair Witch Project</a>, Legend Of The 5ive is shot night-for-night. This means that our ghost-hunters spend most of their time engulfed by the pitch black of night. We can't see what's out in the field, which enhances both the atmosphere and chill factor.

The special effects are admirably graphic and gory for such a low budget (reputedly 2,000 English pounds -- less than $3,000 in American money).

The film's biggest flaw is its initially slow pace. We're 40 minutes into the film before things get exciting. Until then it's mostly exposition and talk and setup and talk.

Most of the actors are decent, if unexceptional. Lee J. Higgs and Greg Tanner give the standout (and enjoyably hammy) performances as a pretentious psychic and smarmy TV host, respectively. Also deserving mention is Les Necus as Old Man Joe, playing a colorful country local who warns about the witch. (Seems many horror films have an Old Timer who warns the young 'uns about the evil in them dare woods.)

The DVD cover shows a young woman levitating. This scene is NOWHERE in the film. No levitations. Yet another example of a horror film engaging in dishonest marketing. Maybe the distributor is to blame?

The latter half of Legend Of The 5ive is entertaining enough for its low budget, but it's no 5-star film. Some horror fans will likely be bored by the film's slow pace during the first half. But if they wait it out, they should be satisfied by the film -- provided they didn't pay too much for it.",1414713600,2,3451,5.696498054474708
