2868740,5,B000RL21O0,Once again Leslie Sansone helps with losing weight and getting healthy.  This DVD is no exception.,1202688000,,98,5.125
2868741,4,B000RL21O0,"This video is great, the moves are easy, low impact but effective...it is four miles that fly by. The steps are so easy, I even mute the TV and listen to other things, music or book on tape...I would highly recommend this video.",1202601600,2,228,4.325581395348837
2868742,5,B000RL21O0,"In this video, Leslie does ""circuit training"" by alternating walking intervals with intervals of firming exercises using a resistance band (included with the DVD).  The workout starts with a 5 minute warmup, then another 5 minutes of higher-speed power walking (using Leslie's typical combination of marching in place, side steps, kicks, knee lifts, and hamstring curls).  Then comes a 5 minute segment of lunges and squats--I found this pretty intense since I haven't done these in a while, then 5 minutes of power walking, 5 minutes of upper body exercises using the resistance band (bicep curls, tricep kickbacks, etc), and another 5 minutes of walking ending with a cool down and stretch (a somewhat longer and more complete body stretch than she does in her videos that just use walking).  If you want a full-body workout in just 30 minutes, and one that both gets your heart beating and gives you some resistance training, this DVD is a full package!

The bonus one-mile is a moderate paced walk that is available elsewhere.  It's a fine mile, nothing special, but hey, it's a bonus.",1201651200,68,1089,4.9289617486338795
2868743,3,B000RL21O0,"I'm a HUGE fan of Leslie Sansone so I didn't think twice when I purchased this video. I tell ya what ... I was bored stiff! The music was a bit hard to hear, she was alone, the toning moves were right in the middle of the cardio so by the time she got back to the cardio section it was very hard to get back into a fast walk. 2 miles is usually enough of a workout but this wasn't so I moved into the bonus mile ... it was a bunch of senior citizens who couldn't keep to the beat & I had an even harder time hearing the music. The worst part of all ... it cut off before even going into a cool down. It was like it was part of another video & it was just a portion of it. If your a beginner this would probably work but if ya wanna work up a sweat ... I wouldn't recommend this one.",1200960000,41,782,3.688622754491018
2868744,3,B000RL21O0,"I was very excited to get this DVD that I had preordered, as I enjoy Leslie Sansone and truly love her workouts.  But.. I have to say, this was very hard to get into/keep into.

It was actually boring.  She's alone in the DVD.  And truthfully, I will give it another shot.  I did not complete the entire workout.

Then I went forward to the bonus mile.  It's a workout that's already available to purchase, something with senior citizens.",1197849600,26,438,4.468354430379747
2868745,5,B000RL21O0,"The fact that this dvd incorporates the firming, strechie band into the walking routine is great. Having the firming and walking together cuts down on time. The fact that this dvd is reasonably priced for what you get (dvd plus stretchie band) only makes it a sweeter deal. I am so thankful to Leslie for not making the stretchie band a separate purchase. There are some competitors out there who do this practice and it drives me crazy! Overall, as I said earlier, I recommend this dvd whole-heartedly. Leslie makes it easy to follow and she is the best walking coach ever. I found that she paces the walk just right and is there every step of the way with positive reinforcement and encouragement. What a treat to have this exercise guru giving you personal health coaching all in the privacy of your room. Thanks Leslie for not just filling a need in the market but making the personalized walking routine memorable. She is truly a friend and mentor not just another fad. Leslie Sansone withstands time and if you buy this dvd, you'll understand first-hand why:) Get this dvd today, you will not regret it!!! Go Leslie!",1300233600,2,1122,4.671717171717172
2868746,5,B000RL21O0,"When I watched the preview clip of this one, I thought I couldn't get much benefit from using a Resistance band. WRONG! I can definitely feel this in my arms and legs. The band helps with balance while doing the lunges. Yes, you can lose weight using Leslie's DVD's. Advanced exercisers may not be challenged, but Begin/Inter will be. These are perfect for people who no longer want to (or can't) do high-impact, bone jarring, back straining hard core cardio. Try it!",1285200000,2,467,4.7073170731707314
2868747,2,B000RL21O0,"I have several Leslie Sansone videos that I like very much, but this is not one of them.  It's great to get the resistance bands, but she does not use them enough to provide any real firming.  There are very few exercises using them.  When they are used, there aren't enough reps to train muscles.
The one-mile segment begins with an endless intro to walking by Dr. Ken Cooper.  This is clearly filler material that provides no new information.  I mean, if we didn't know that walking is good exercise, we wouldn't have purchased the video.  The actual walk, for ""Active Adults"", is very easy and boring.  It ends abruptly--Leslie is in the middle of a sentence!  Very poor editing.
Leslie needs to take a break and learn some new techniques before doing more videos.  She has saturated the market with products that do not provide the promised workouts.",1265760000,7,854,4.677852348993288
2868748,5,B000RL21O0,I love this dvd with the band.  I have been using it for a few short weeks and already see results.,1251936000,,99,3.7142857142857144
2868749,5,B000RL21O0,"I enjoy this video, after using it for awhile like all exercise video's I turn the sound down and play my own music.  I have been feeling better and moving around more since I have begun using it.  I have fms and had to start by only do small segments until I could work my way up to doing the whole video and using the band.  It's great and easy.",1250985600,2,347,3.9285714285714284
2868750,5,B000RL21O0,"I have been using this DVD as well as different WalK programs by Leslie Sansone for the past 3 months. I have lost inches and pounds and feel these are a great introduction back to excercising on a regular basis. Not only that, I like the fact that it is low impact and I do get my sweat on!!!!!!",1246665600,5,296,4.033898305084746
2868751,4,B000RL21O0,"Wow, what a  workout.  I was sore the next day from the powerful toning intervals.  Was an all in on workout with toning, cardio and intervals, was great,  Well done Leslie.",1246406400,,173,4.483870967741935
2868752,5,B000RL21O0,Leslie Sansone is THE BEST! Her work outs are effective & good for EVERYONE from beginner to advanced! I own MANY of her videos & they are all GREAT!,1239321600,3,149,4.172413793103448
2868753,5,B000RL21O0,"I love this Leslie Sansone product.  I have a lot of her workouts, and this adds a little variety.  It is circuit training.  There is a little bit of low impact jogging along with the fast walking, kicks, knee lifts. There is also a couple sessions of strength training with the stretch band mixed in. It just shakes up the routine. She does do some explanations with the stretchband, but once you know the moves you can go ahead and get into it, and actually you can keep walking while you do the upper body strengthening. I really liked it.",1238112000,2,542,4.4
2868754,4,B000RL21O0,"This is a good, short workout with a little bit of toning. I definitely feel it more in my legs than arms though.  I also wish there was some ab workout included.  If you are already in pretty good shape the toning portion probably will not do much for you but it's still a good walking workout.",1237939200,,295,4.157894736842105
2868755,5,B000RL21O0,As always Leslie Sansone is great. She is very motivating and gives a great workout.,1234396800,,84,4.666666666666667
2868756,3,B000RL21O0,"I love Leslie Sansone videos and wanted this one to give more variety to my workouts. The bonus 1-mile walk ends abruptly, in fact mid-sentence. At first I thought my CD was defective, but checked the time display and it ended at 0, also, another reviewer noted the same thing.",1231286400,,277,4.56
2868757,5,B000RL21O0,This is another great workout from Leslie Sansone! The fitness band really makes it intense!,1229817600,,92,5.2
2868758,5,B000RL21O0,It is fun to work out. I do it with my husband and I have never been able to get him to work out with me.,1224806400,,105,3.076923076923077
2868759,5,B000RL21O0,"I purchased this video to try and diversify my exercise routine and I am extremely pleased with the video.  Doing the walking program didn't completely exhaust me for the rest of the day, but I certainly felt the effects the next day to know that I had gotten a good work out.  The two-mile cross training portion of this video is a great, quick way to work the whole body in only 30 minutes.  As Leslie says ""It is a boosted two-miles"".  I would definently recommend this product for beginners and intermediates who want to try something new.",1224806400,7,543,4.510204081632653
2868760,5,B000RL21O0,"I loved this DVD, and as usual, Leslie is a pleasure.  I have had great success with circuit type exercise and am thrilled that Leslie put together this type of program.",1218499200,,169,4.451612903225806
2868761,4,B000RL21O0,This walking video is with Leslie on her own using the stretchy band to perform various strength training exercises at intervals while walking. You will feel the difference especially the first time you do it. She is alone though and it may not be as much fun as her other videos.,1213920000,,280,4.509803921568627
2868762,3,B000RL21O0,"I am a big fan of Leslie and have been very successful with cardio and physical fitness using her walk tapes. I really liked the ""circuit training"" in the first segment. Only, I hoped that it would be at least 3 miles, not 2. Now on the bonus walk, I didn't feel it should have been included in this particlar DVD because it is a beginner workout for seniors. If that weren't enough, the bonus workout ended so abruptly just before what I thought would be a cool down. I'm really perplexed on this one.",1213315200,6,502,4.294736842105263
2868763,5,B000RL21O0,"GREAT WORKOUT! I HAVE SEVERAL OF HER TAPES, BUT THIS IS THE ONE THAT KEEPS ME MOTIVATED AND MAKES ME WANT TO EXERCISE. I ALREADY LOST 20 POUNDS.",1207785600,4,144,4.178571428571429
2868764,3,B000RL21O0,"I'm new to the Leslie Sansone workout line, and I have to say that the true test of a video workout is whether you can keep doing it without losing your mind.  I've been using the DVD for about a month now, and while there are drawbacks (the bonus workout is preceded by a LOOOOONNNGGG lecture from some doctor; the workout itself cuts off abruptly before getting into the cooldown,; in the main workout the camera work could be better - for example, Sansone sometimes starts a new move while the camera is closeup on her face), I've enjoyed it.  I find the main workout with the included firming band to be pretty challenging, and the bonus workout with the seniors (clumsy though some of them may be) is kind of charming and just the length I need on a busy day.  Sansone is perky but not excessively so.

To sum up, I will probably buy other DVDs in this line.",1204070400,14,863,4.341614906832298
8201198,5,B000RL21O0,"If you want a quick intense workout that covers all the bases, this is for you! This is my FAVORITE workout and I have done lots of them.",1449619200,,137,3.9285714285714284
8201199,4,B000RL21O0,"I like this DVD and the pacing.  They did not include the toning band, which was kind of a bummer, but all in all, a good DVD.  You DO need a firming band from someplace though.",1434931200,,177,3.888888888888889
8201200,5,B000RL21O0,Good video and I can still use the band.,1432252800,,40,3.5555555555555554
8201201,1,B000RL21O0,no firm band,1428710400,,12,3.3333333333333335
8201202,3,B000RL21O0,The band after a while just snaps and breaks.  Does not last maybe a year or less.  Videos are good.,1412467200,,100,3.95
8201203,5,B000RL21O0,arrived on time and  in excellent shape and  loved the workout  was not to hard and very easy to workout to.,1393891200,,108,4.0476190476190474
8201204,5,B000RL21O0,this is a really great cd!  i have others of hers and this one is one of my all-time favorites...,1380672000,,97,3.85
8201205,5,B000RL21O0,If you haven't exercised in a while Leslie Sansone workouts will help you get started. I had been exercising her to a while before I bought this dvd. I wanted to change it up. I truly felt like she worked every muscle in body. You will definately feel the burn with this. I really felt it the next morning when I woke up and had a hard time walking up and down the stairs. My thighs and glutes must have a wonderful workout because I also had a hard time trying to sit on the couch...Lol. It was worth it though. I must have been a little over zealous that day but that workout was a nice change of pace to move from one segment to the next. Overall you will enjoy it.,1359331200,,668,4.030075187969925
8201206,5,B000RL21O0,Very well made DVD if you follow her instructions you will begin to feel it firming you up right away I have 4 of her DVD's and will purchase more.,1322611200,,147,3.933333333333333
8201207,3,B000RL21O0,"I like the first workout on this DVD (Walk & Firm with Interval Training) but I am really disappointed with the second workout.  It ends abruptly during the cool down walk.  I even purchased another copy of the DVD thinking the problem was with the individual DVD.  Not so, the second DVD does the same thing.  I see from reading the other reviews that this seems to be a situation common to the entire DVD production.",1306713600,,418,4.4605263157894735
