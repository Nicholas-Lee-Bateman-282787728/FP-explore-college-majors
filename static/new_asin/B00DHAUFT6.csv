8593139,3,B00DHAUFT6,"Sanjay Gupta has made a career out of glorifying gangsters and showing them as humans who had been wronged by society and the legal system. He has directed several movies glorifying their exploits and the most prominent was the Shootout at Lokhandwala fim which provided a fictional angle to a incident that happened in Bombay. Shootout at Wadala gives us a view of the first encounter of a criminal by the Bombay Police.
 Manohar Arjun Surve (John Abraham) is a straight guy who merely wants to finish his college and marry his sweetheart Kangna Ranaut. His brother is a criminal and one day in trying to protect his brother from a sure death he gets a life imprisonment. Jail obviusly changes him and he becomes Manya Surve. Together with Sheikh Munir ( Tusshar Kapoor) they from a gang to control Bombay and they start buttin heads with the dons Dilawar Imtiaz Haksar (Sonu Sood) and his brother Zubair Imtiaz Haksar (Manoj Bajpayee). Fedup of the gangwars  Inspector Aafaque Baagraan (Anil Kapoor), plans to end the gangs at any cost.
Shootout is a loud movie and I am not just talking about the jarring music. There is a lot of cursing and shouting which after a while becomes monotonous. There are three item songs but I only enjoyed Laila.
John Abraham gives a performance of his life time and shows a great deal of growth as an actor. The rest of the cast is effective but Sonu Sood is the most.
This was an average film and tried to make a small time gang member in to a big deal. Three stars. 8/6/13",1376611200,2,1509,4.544117647058823
