7608014,4,B01ASMCHPA,"My second favorite GITS film.

Hard to enjoy fully the first time. There are so many links to the story that are hard to catch till your second time around. So much deeper than the first 2 movies. It's the type to age better with time.

As for the Bluray+DVD+Digital Version it doesn't seem like there is any ber special content that I'd pay more for even even being a big GITS fan from the beginning. Just the extra DVD works to share with friends.",1460160000,6,449,4.270588235294118
7608015,4,B01ASMCHPA,"Over all a very good movie. Some of the character re designs didn't work for me. The rather sadistic turn for Saito, With the Major the hair and eyes were very off to what many are use to.

Don't let that distract you from a great story, being mostly a Prequel and some interesting new back grounds.",1459987200,2,299,4.245614035087719
7608016,5,B01ASMCHPA,"I found this to be another great entry in the franchise and a top notch anime. Great story and superb animation make this an enjoyable film. I am a big fan of this series and have been following it from the beginning. I personally have never been disappointed. Every new addition just keeps me intrigued and always pleasantly surprised. This  film brings back the crew and the Major in another cyber adventure. I love the fun and excitement all the way.
This franchise is more complex than most anime out there but it is worth the extra attention. Those who like the old series may find fault but for me the film is a great add on.",1459987200,,631,4.3931623931623935
7608017,5,B01ASMCHPA,"A great endcap for the latest version of Ghost in the Shell and an excellent way to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the franchise, the oddly titled New Movie is best enjoyed if you have watched the previous Arise films, but can still be appreciated if you haven't. Action packed and with a deep story, GitS: The New Movie is an enjoyable ride from start to finish.",1459987200,25,366,4.477611940298507

I was disappointed with the new character design when ARISE OVA first came out,

7608028,3,B01ASMCHPA,"I didn't really ""get"" this film. I own every show and film from the series and watched Arise several times, but this film was confusing and scattered. I did not enjoy it aside from the visuals and characters I enjoy. The plot requires multiple viewings and that's a failure. It is not even in the same ballpark as Solid State Society. I became kind of irritated after the halfway point. I think this was just another group of ""episodes"" of Arise bundled into a film. A lot of style over substance, unfortunately. 3 stars is generous.",1499558400,2,533,4.5625

7608031,2,B01ASMCHPA,"As a longtime fan of the series, I didn't think this was any better than OK.  It's the story of right before the events of the original movie, and a continuation of the ""Arise"" series which recently came out.  It strays a little from the original story.  Now, it seems the Major never had a human body and was given a full prosthetic body before birth, which is a little weird to me.

I was pretty bummed out after buying the entire Arise series along with ""The New Movie"" and popping it in after finishing up Arise. Despite this, still worth 5 stars as the Arise series is pretty fantastic.",1492473600,5,373,4.3428571428571425

7608040,4,B01ASMCHPA,"A few thoughts on this movie:
I'm writing this assuming that you've already watched everything Ghost in the Shell. If you haven't, what are you doing with your life? I think it's time to reassess.
I wish they'd said in the description that this movie isn't part of the original series, it follows the ARISE series. Now I'll have to go back and watch that so I can understand what all the changes were.
While we're on the subject, can we please stop with these reimaginings of classic series? If you want to do something new you don't get there by taking a classic series and taking an eggbeater to it. If you have a good idea, people will like it and if you have a bad idea, associating it with something better won't save it, it just pisses people off. I don't care if the original author wrote it or not.
Having watched this movie I have to say that it didn't stand out in any particular way but I have to admit I was spending a lot of time trying to figure out what was going on and why everyone looked and sounded different. This wasn't helped by the former lead English actress (or should I say actor?) being assigned to another character entirely.
Our heroine (hero?) spends most of this movie in a suit of bright red motorcycle leathers. These are amazing in that they never make a single sound throughout the whole film despite the occasional acrobatics.
Our leading lady from the original series never rode a motorcycle although I'm sure she knew how to.
Our leading lady in the ARISE series would have gotten her ass kicked if she went against her counterpart in the original series. She doesn't seem to be as on top of things as her older counterpart. Maybe that's just age but... no it's not it's the writing. I really don't think this character could develop into the older character. Why would they reimagine the series with a worse lead, and in a counter espionage unit?
The ARISE series does differentiate itself by losing the sexiness of everything that came before it. I'm not sure why this is but it is a noticeable difference in the series.
I should also mention that this is the lamest movie title I've seen for anything anime.",1488931200,5,2148,4.482142857142857
7608041,3,B01ASMCHPA,I bought this movie from a big box retailer thinking it was a direct sequel to the original film. it felt more like a long episode of the one of the tv series. i felt deceived by the title of the film since i thought it was ghost in the shell 2: innocents. i suppose i should have done my research.,1487548800,,298,3.901639344262295

This is not a sequel to the first two movies, the other movies are in a different universe in my understanding.  The ending of this movie is kinda confusing, you will know what I mean if you see the first movie.  Of the three movies this one is the most up-beat.

7608051,5,B01ASMCHPA,Another great story line. This series never ceases to amaze and delight me. Good story most anyone can follow but for newbies I would suggest watching the first Ghost in the Shell movie first so you can get an idea of the characters and their background.  Hollywood is releasing a full feature length movie Ghost in the Shell which looks like a piece of garbage. This story and characters take place in Japan but of course Hollywood wants to cast Scarlet Johansson for the role. I hope I spelled her name wrong. Scarlet did that movie Lucy and so desperately wants to be the New from The Matrix. The female Matrix was done already and it was called Sucker Punch. That movie was awesome so Ghost in the Shell anomie series Good. Hollywood Ghost in the Shell garbage.,1479168000,2,765,4.543478260869565

7608056,5,B01ASMCHPA,"If your a Ghost in the Shell fan, this is a must. The new ARISE series was fantastic from both an artistic and story telling perspective. The movie takes place after the 4 mini-movie episodes (or 5, if you count the Pyro episode as well) and concludes the story began in Episode 1. This is a full length movie and has a mix of story and action, much like the series before it. ARISE was so good I only ask for more of it! Or at least more GITS.

7608066,5,B01ASMCHPA,Was a bit concerned that this movie might just stray a bit too far from the original series but I shouldn't have been to concerned. (There are a few things brought up in the original series that are somewhat different here. but the overall background and history fits fairly well.)  We get more insight into the Major's background and how she formed her team and they came to be with Section 9. I liked the way the connection between her and her team members was laid out and the ending reminded you of the what the Major finally came to be in the original series. A must have if you're a Ghost In The Shell fan. Good Job!,1468800000,3,622,4.271186440677966

7608080,5,B01ASMCHPA,"Just finished watching ""Ghost In The Shell - The New Movie"" released by Funimation.
""Ghost In The Shell - The New Movie"" is a prequel of sorts that delves deep into the past of Major Motoko Kusanagi as she and the team of special operatives that she has assembled are given nearly free reign to investigate who is behind the assignation of the Prime Minister and who is responsible for the deadly Fire-Starter Virus which is infecting and killing ""Ghosts.""
Major Motoko Kusanagi is colder and darker in this movie, referring to her team as parts.  There is also deep animosity between Major Motoko Kusanagi and her team against Section 9.
While there are no new revelations here, the ground work has been laid for Major Motoko Kusanagi and her team to become members of Section 9.
Spectacular Animation.

7608083,4,B01ASMCHPA,"After Arise 1,2,3,4 it is the conclusion of the team building process for team Makoto Kusanagi. It is nice and OK and leads straight forward to the SAC series, it is therefore a prequel for the series.
Nicely made, entertaining but nothing new. For my opinion, it can't compete with Innocence, which is one of the best movies, I personally, know. There is not much more to say about this movie. My own conclusion is: Very well made but nothing really new. It shades some more light on the background of Makoto but nothing else. It just completes the overall picture, that's all.

7608085,4,B01ASMCHPA,"You will need to have watched, and enjoyed, the Arise series before tackling this movie length feature. That accepted, this is the same classy and well-paced piece of work we all expect from the oeuvre.
The writing, as usual, neither insults your intelligence, nor retreats up its own nether regions in pretentiousness (a la Innocence).

Is it a link between Arise and GiTS?

Well... that depends, the final scene appears to be a direct recapitulation of the prelude scene in GiTS. But it is not. Are they messing with us? Watch, make up your own mind.

Afterword: Why not five stars? I have reservations about the rewrite of the character recruitment out of Arise and that carries through to this. If you have forgiven the Arise committee for doing something any American writing team does with any given hero ensemble franchise, move it up a star.
A must-have for aficionados.",1464048000,15,878,4.84

7608089,2,B01ASMCHPA,"This is a prequel to the original movie of the same title, and it's as terrible as the original was great.  The original ""Ghost in the Shell"" movie was quite ahead of its time in both story telling as well as the quality of animation back in the mid 90s. It was ""The Matrix"" before that move existed, and for any fan of sci-fi it was excellent. You could say that a lot of the tech and ""personal connectivity"" we have today was accurately predicted by the original movie.

One of my favorite quotes from the original that highlights the quality of the dialog that the first film had: ""If we all reacted the same way, we'd be predictable, and there's always more than one way to view a situation. What's true for the group is also true for the individual. It's simple: Overspecialize, and you breed in weakness. It's slow death.""

There is nothing near this caliber of thoughtfulness in the dialog of the new movie. You get generic drivel that goes in one ear and out the other, assuming you watch it more than 10 minutes.

The ""new movie"" is hardly anything new. It pales in comparison to the original and has none of the depth or interest that made the first movie worth watch. From the very beginning you hardly care about any of the characters if you are seeing them for the first time. It's like they assume you watched the first one so they don't bother doing any character development at all...although if you did watch the first one you'll feel nothing but disappointment as the film progresses.

Perhaps the greatest contrast between this and the original movie is that the original did a very good job of telling both the main story while developing Kusanagi and giving her a unique personality that is more than just a do-as-ordered cyborg. In the new movie, they don't really veer too far off the beaten path and focus on just one thing

Lastly, it seems like even Kusanagi is no match for the P.C. police. There was no blood/gore and no nudity...which made the last scene of this movie especially disappointing. My recommendation: buy the original and skip this one.",1463702400,10,2078,4.557640750670242

Also, the story is not nearly as complex as a SAC movie or arc might create, making it somewhat predictable.",1462060800,2,277,4.914893617021277

7608100,4,B01ASMCHPA,"I haven't seen the 4 part Arise.  Like many I wasn't fond of changing voice actors or prequels.  But I found this in
WalMart (before Amazon's release date) and just decided to go for it.  It was worth the $20.  It's very fast paced,
for the younger attention deficit crowd.  No time for thoughtful storytelling.  And the music is mostly generic video
game music.  Still it was enjoyable in the way when you are starved for new product of one of the greatest anime
of all time.  It will never measure up to the original movies and series, but nothing lasts forever. One complaint
about one of the bonus features.  How did the 3rd movie Solid State Society get dropped from the ""official"" history?
SSS was great.  Innocence had great animation but was more like an exploration into philosophy.",1461715200,5,791,4.625899280575539
7608101,3,B01ASMCHPA,"It's a ""Ghost"" movie, so It's entertaining but is somehow hung up on the existential crisis of digital life and doesn't really go anywhere by the end of the film. Unlike the previous film(s) the enemy isn't as thought provoking and feels like a wasted albeit entertaining opportunity to tread new ground. It is a good companion piece to the four OVA's that preceded this this theatrical release though.",1460937600,3,402,4.840579710144928
7608102,3,B01ASMCHPA,"Just as i marked the stars.
  It was okay- but you can tell they were going for more of the PG rating crowd(i know,i know- all the Movies they made were rated PG)
  They were very careful not to show anything sensual about this new animation of the major.
  The theme was not as exciting as the other two movies (watch  ""Ghost in the shell-Innocence"" especially-it had more adult type theme's in my opinion).
  Anytime you do a prequel it's not going to appeal to many people that have seen the other two movies and i am afraid i am one of those.
  This movie was watchable but didn't hold my attention as well as the other two either. Sorry!",1460419200,7,642,4.266666666666667
