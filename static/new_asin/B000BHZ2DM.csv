8086839,5,B000BHZ2DM,"There is not a Christmas episode on this dvd but there are 5 great stories. The picture on the DVD is deceiving. One would think there to be a special episode about Christmas but none of the stories on this DVD are about Christmas. If you are specifically looking for a Christmas/Holiday themed DVD this is not the right one. Although, these stories do all have a great theme and show the importance of manners. The DVD runs about 60 minutes total.

Lend a helping hand- Brother and Sister help Widder Jones clean out her attic and through spending time with her and cleaning they lerrn the importance of making time for others.

Giddy grandma- Sister has to do a project about someone you admire. She stops by Grans for a book and comes across a lot of things in Gran's attic. She realizes that her Gran has done some great things and decides that out of all the famous bears, her Gran is who she admires most.

Hiccup cure - the cubs learn that eating too fast causes more than just hiccups. Papa has a bad case of hiccups that get in the way of him getting his work order done.

female fullback- brother and his friends want to win at football but there plays aren't working. They go looking to find someone to join their team that can help them.

grow it- sister has to cut her hair because she fell into a thistle bush. Class pictures are coming up and she is worried about pictures without her fur. This is a story about being patient and waiting for things.

Also includes auto play which comes in handy",1459814400,,1510,4.375

8086842,4,B000BHZ2DM,"Although this is a another great Berenstain collection teaching important values for kids, I bought it to put in my Christmas collection of shorts.  Seeing the cover showing a Christmas tree, wreath, and gifts I assumed (incorrectly) that at least one of the episodes would be for or about the holidays.  None of these episodes are about Christmas.  One could argue that good manners and values are for all seasons and it is true I did like the DVD, but was a bit disappointed there wasn't a special Christmas episode (like the collection ""Christmas Tree."")  If you are looking specifically for a Christmas cartoon, get that one instead.",1302134400,2,637,4.87037037037037
