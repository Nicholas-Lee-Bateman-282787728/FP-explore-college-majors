8288632,1,B001CQ5PCE,This isn't a movie..this is a high school quality film project that Amazon put online as a movie. I enjoy watching bad horror movies..but..this was a chore to watch.,1442793600,,165,4.724137931034483
8288633,1,B001CQ5PCE,"I tapped after about five minutes. This ""movie"" looks, at best, like a public access TV show. Don't waste your time and for the love of all that is holy, do NOT pay to see this!",1415318400,,177,3.9444444444444446
8288634,1,B001CQ5PCE,"I watched the entire thing. Sigh. I wouldn't consider this movie a tongue-in-cheek on the genre of zombie movies. I can see that's what they intended, but it falls horribly flat.  Not even the ample T & A shots (well, the T are ample, the A not so much) can save this from what it is - mind numbingly bad.",1369440000,3,305,4.083333333333333
8288635,1,B001CQ5PCE,"This movies is just bad all around.  Bad acting, bad graphics and bad everything.  I'm glad it was free because I would not pay a one cent to view this video.  Bad zombie movie.",1368576000,,177,4.147058823529412
8288636,2,B001CQ5PCE,"Although one of my favorites, Jacqueline Lovell, is listed as the star in this little romp, she is a ""2 minute cameo"" that was filmed in her home by husband, Edward Nyahay. Because I loved her so much in HIDEOUS I made an effort to check this out by contacting her.

Forced to give it a rating, I gave it two stars simply because I resented being led to believe Lovell was a major part of this project. On the other hand, if 'walking dead' movies is your style, give it a go and let the rest of us know if it's worth the time and price.",1235606400,,536,4.009345794392523
