8721047,5,B00ZWC1AWS,"This is really a great DVD, I purchased this with money left over from a gift card I had. I always have been a fan of Dirk because of his unique skill set that he brings to the game. He is really one of those quiet superstars that we don't know about because he is foreign born. It's extremely interesting on his workout routines, his personal coach and a look into his personal life. Dirk will go down as one of the greatest players of all time but he seems to be even a better person. Throughly enjoyed this DVD and a must have for any basketball fan...",1448928000,,555,4.148148148148148
