7927068,3,B00004YA6Y,"As I found out when I had first  bought the DVD which had plain color back drop intros instead of the a.k.a. printing on the photos datas it's too bland with that very essence being stripped bare and doesn't make the follow-ups appear to be just as appealing.so until I find out it's released the very way it was 1st seen on CBS-TV on May 24,1995 I just won't want it. What's also edited out of this feature from when it was first on tv is the audio intro by the ""Mother"" of ""This is our first reunion since the girls 'got married.' "" of which of course goes without saying that it's sarcastic and serious at once. Also in the true Brady Tradition of of cynicism and sarcasm but a new touch of seriousness added to it.",1264118400,,718,4.202898550724638
