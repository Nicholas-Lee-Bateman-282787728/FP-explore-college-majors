744962,5,6303960200,"With all due respect to the person who said that the CD version was better than the original. Let it be kniown that the CD was a recording of a different concert on the same ""Wanted"" tour.
In any event, I feel the video is much funnier than the CD, because we can see those classic expressions. A lot of Richard's comedy is visual. This is without a doubt, his finest work.
This is Jimi at Woodstock. This is Reggie Jackon in Game 6 of the 1977 World Series.
The best ever at HIS BEST EVER.
GET THIS VIDEO!!!",984441600,8,508,4.141414141414141
744963,5,6303960200,"This is by far Richard Pryor's best taped concert. I saw it with my college roommate for the first time. He had already seen it, and he was laughing at me because I was laughing so hard that it literally brought tears to my eyes!
Then I bought the tape a few years later and watched it with my wife. She was laughing so hard that she missed most of the dialogue the first time around. She had to watch it again to catch what she had missed.
It's Richard Pryor at his rudest, crudest best-talking about his squirrel monkeys, run-ins with the police, heart attacks, drug use, sex, hunting and being an amateur boxer.
If you want to laugh your ... off, get this tape! It's hilarious!",977443200,15,680,4.3203125
744964,5,6303960200,"My favorite parts of this movie are the ease with which Richard gets into the heads and talks about animals, from the monkey to the dogs and the horses and the dog that comes over to help richard mourn the loss of the  monkey and leaves telling him he's going to chase him again tomorrow.  He  gets very personal in terms of drugs and heart attacks and its very funny  in a somewhat warped way.  Also quite touching. They say Richard set the  stage for Eddie and chris Rock and all of them, and this is true, good,  self-deprecating and funny standup stuff. The funniest I've ever seen  Richard Pryor.",957916800,3,601,4.4
744965,5,6303960200,"This is quite possibly the finest piece of stand-up comdey ever captured on film.  Richard Pryor is at his absolute best, and the material is identifiable, thought provoking, and most of all, uproariously funny.  The  first fifteen or twenty minutes is an incredible outburst of energy, and  will have the viewer laughing out loud almost non-stop.  Pryor is great at  turning everyday occurances into something everybody can laugh at, and even  painful moments can transform into material.  There are not enough words in  the english language to adequately describe how funny this performance is,  and I have personally seen it nearly 10 times.  The language is strong, but  this really does not diminish or distract from the material itself.
My  only observation may be that the negative reviews have all been for the DVD  copy, which evidently is not up to quality standards.  This is certainly  not the case with the video cassette version, and I can only recommend that  this edition be purchased.  All other reviews have been 5/5 stars, and the  poor quality DVD edition should be taken off the market until it can be  remastered.",955238400,87,1135,4.9361702127659575
744966,5,6303960200,"This is the greatest stand-up performance I've ever seen. The jokes are brilliant and the impersonations - from dogs to deer to stuttering Chinese waiters - are spot-on funny. But like all truly great comedy, the jokes  spring from a deep well of humanity. Only a genius can make you laugh at his own heart attack, cocaine addiction and unhappy childhood. This is  comedy with more depth and emotion - and sheer comic talent - than anything  I've ever seen before. I would never again watch any of those dreadful  films that Pryor made (eg. The Toy, Stir Crazy) but I have watched  ""Live in Concert"" many times and it always makes me laugh. The man is a genius.",951004800,3,661,4.5210084033613445
744967,5,6303960200,to really understand the genius&legacy of richard pryor then you have to hear and see his stage show.he takes on many topics and do them all justice.he is the king of comedy&stage.,947289600,,180,4.65625
744968,5,6303960200,"Of all his concert movie.  This one is a pure gem.  You will laugh as hard or as long in your life.  Please, check your blood pressure after seeing this one.",930873600,,157,4.0
744969,5,6303960200,"Pryor's brillance as a story teller, urban humorist, and master of colloquial speech was never more obvious than in this, the first, and by far the best of his three ""live"" concert films. Pryor's  observations on death, sex, marriage, and racial difference is presented as  rthymically as a Albert Ailey ballet, punctuated with obscentity laced  speech that seems as natural to the performance as a pair of toe slippers  on a ballerina.  Filmgoers can watch Pryor mesermize his live concert  audience as he slips nimbly between multiple characterizations like a quick  change artist, playing everything from a heart attack victim negotiating  with God to a Great Dane contemplating a sexual encounter with a Shetland  Pony.  Camera close-ups capture Pryor's ability to transform his face and  body from cheetah chasing a gazelle to a child asked to go outside and  bring in a switch; from white woman weeping at a white funeral to a black  woman wailing at a black funeral  - all the contortions, dialects, and  expressions without benefit or need of special effects.  Pryor's raw,  natural humor is captured to perfection, live and spontaneous as it  happened - but preseved, thankfully, in this film.  In a day when  cable was in its infancy, not fully testing it's wide-open, uncensored  content of today, most audiences had no opportunity to see Pryor on stage,  unbridled and unrestrained.  At the time of the filming, theater owners had  no experience with comedy-concert films, yet alone one starring an  unpredictable maverick who had been compared to a black Lenny Bruce with an  attitude.  After the concert was filmed, the producers could find no  theater chain interested in taking a chance on this first-ever comedy  performance movie and were forced to resort to ""four-walling"" the  film in a single Los Angeles themselves.  The long lines and sold out  crowds changed the minds of  theater chain owners and the film eventually  opened nationwide to universally rave reviews and greatful audiences.  The film's continuous contageous humor is only matched by the film's  historical importance.",912297600,6,2106,5.14540059347181

Been too many years I forget. But I remember how shocked I was to find how bad the dvd was. The video tape that was released in hifi from 1996 is the best quality I have yet to see. They haven't re released since 2006. So I know this is the defective dvd. And they originally released this in 1998 on dvd I remember that one was a transfer mess as well. They never fixed this. It's time they should from the original print in HD.,1426032000,,606,4.016528925619835

745403,1,6303960200,"Unfortunately, I was able to watch only about the first 15 minutes of this - maybe less, but it seemed like more.  I wasn't laughing.  Racism is not something I usually find funny, and this was too far over the top for me.  The part I saw did not venture out of this topic, which is why I stopped watching it, disgusted.

Americans have an unfortunate fixation on being cool.  It's not just adolescents - and of course, if you like Richard Pryor, that's very cool.  In other places, they have different priorities, so to be looked up to, there has to be something else.  Perhaps being cool should not be the ultimate goal in one's life.",1424131200,,636,4.384615384615385

I have watched most, if not all of his standup performances available on video, and this one is truly the best. Richard is crude and raunchy, but he speaks the truth that we never talk about! It's really hard to describe how funny this DVD is, because they was just so much material that spanned a lot of subjects. Some of my favorites include Richard's bit about the woods, including a deer and a bear as well his bit about his pet monkey and his dogs. We couldn't leave out the sex part of course, and he has plenty to say on that subject, and you may find yourself thinking of certain relationships when he gets into the sex bit.

Profanities when used by Pryor becomes almost silly and funny in its very connotation, unlike the ppl who try to replicate it. There can only be one true comedy king ( yes, as opposed to the false one) and that is King Richard Pryor, Rest-in-Peace, my friend.
Great Record and the ultimate  tonic for depressed people world over.

745915,5,6303960200,"When asked for an example of something to ""hot"" to be included in the National Recording Registry, Gene DeAnna, the director of the recorded sound division at the Library of Congress, immediately replied: ""The example that comes to mind, to me, is a Richard Pryor record."" He continued, ""I think out of context, the language and often edgy, racial overtones of the recording could be put against the library and it could hurt feelings."" Given a chance to see ""Richard Pryor - Live in Concert"", you'll be laughing to hard to find your feelings hurt!

According to Former Kennedy Center President Lawrence J. Wilker, ""Richard Pryor was selected as the first recipient of the new Mark Twain Prize because as a stand-up comic, writer, and actor, he struck a chord, and a nerve, with America, forcing it to look at large social questions of race and the more tragicomic aspects of the human condition. Though uncompromising in his wit, Pryor, like Twain, projects a generosity of spirit that unites us. They were both trenchant social critics who spoke the truth, however outrageous."" To get an impression of the wide ranging scope of his talent, search out a biography and note the list of performers and writers that he worked for and with - it's truly amazing!

Richard Pryor is possibly the funniest person ever, and this is a masterpiece. His storytelling at it's best, and the improvisational banter with the audience is incredible. A must-have for anyone (everyone!) who enjoys a thought provoking, mind expanding, belly laugh!",1186358400,3,1529,4.945525291828794

745917,5,6303960200,"Released in 1979, Richard Pryor's first concert film is a landmark of comic brilliance that he never could surpass - though ""Live on the Sunset Strip"" certainly has its moments. Pryor sets the Long Beach theater ablaze with a rapid-fire array of personal and social observations that made him one of America's most incisive humorists. ""Live in Concert"" remains the ideal showcase for his unique talents and the best way to remember him.",1161302400,11,436,4.986301369863014
745918,5,6303960200,"It's safe to say that NO other live stand-up comedy show can equal to ""Richard Pryor Live in Concert"", not even his others.  This was a rare magical night when everything went right.  Amazingly, he put more than 100% into this comedy act and it shows!  Richard Pryor commands the entire stage for his outstanding physical performance.

Known for his observational humor, he shares insight into his family and with his grandmother.  In his act, he seems to show just a little more respect for women than some comedians brash do.  Pryor pokes a lot of fun at himself, his troubles with his wife and the law.  His humor works for a variety of people regardless of ethnicity!

He brilliantly takes on the voices of many characters and furthermore, he interjects the voice and thoughts of his dogs, and monkeys and he even takes on the voice that attacks the heart (experiencing a heart attack).  He translates to us the  voice of body parts.  Pryor is hilarious at imitating the white man, vocally and physically.

Yes, there is profanity, but he is NOT as disgusting or crude as so many others.  Like most comedians of his type, there are always the sex routines and his are acceptable without being harsh or crude.

To say this is funny is an understatement.  It is hysterical with nonstop laughter throughout.  Some routines are his fear of swimming, running to be in shape, the Chinese stutterer, in the woods, boxing, grandmother and cocaine, and his role as a parent - that classic bit when he finds his kid in a lie.

This 1979 90-minute performance is a classic!  It's easy to see why Pryor is a major influence on the best comedians around....(Rizzo)",1089504000,24,1655,4.6678200692041525
