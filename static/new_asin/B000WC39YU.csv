When reading through some of the other reviews for the newest Special Edition Mad Max DVD, there were some confusing complaints that I came across, many of which were complaining that the DVD was badly formatted and that the voices had been dubbed over by American actors.  After some further pondering, I realized that the reviewers were commenting on a different DVD release that came out prior to the Special Edition, as well as prior to this Decades Collection Edition.

To put it plainly, this is a retouched version of the theatrical release as far as picture and sound quality.  The sound is in very nice stereo, and the picture has been digitally restored and is in Wide Screen format.  There are NO American voice overs added.  There are a few extras on the DVD, including poster art, two documentaries, and a few trailers.  All in all, I am very pleased with the purchase. It was extremely cheap for the quality.  If you want a low-cost, good version of Mad Max and are not too interested in a bunch of DVD extras, this is a no brainer.

P.S.  Also included is a CD with some hit 70's songs on it, including some Marvin Gaye and Rod Stewart...so, if you haven't heard these heavily overplayed songs on the radio enough, you can own them on CD at no additional cost!",1259020800,3,1356,4.589211618257261
8222318,5,B000WC39YU,"Mad Max is one of my favorite movies, the acting, the plot, the script, the effects for that time were excellent. With no doubt, the movie that inspired this genre, specially for it's low budget.",1246233600,2,195,4.6
