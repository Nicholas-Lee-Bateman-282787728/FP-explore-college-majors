8410066,5,B003Z9K0IK,"I'm a middle school teacher and I showed ""Mr. Positive"" to my students. I am often tired of my 7th grade students being so negative and disrespectful towards each other. Many of them do not use the resources and talents they have and complain constantly about how ""boring"" their lives are.  I showed this video to see what kind of impact it would have on them. You could hear a pin drop in my room. Many of the girls had tears in their eyes and the boys were speechless, which was a miracle in itself. I think all of them were touched by Carl's story.  My students were convicted of their own self-centeredness and lack of ambition. Some were touched by Gramma Risdahl because she foster parented  so many children, including Carl.  Some of my students are in foster care. I think they ""woke up""  and developed a sense of appreciation for what they have because of this documentary.  After the video, it was so quiet in my room, I didn't say much, but I challenged my students to go out to nursing homes to volunteer, help neighbors with yard work, and be more like Carl. Many students promised they would. This documentary of one man's life is so beautifully captured and reaches people of all ages. If it can touch my 7th graders, it can touch anyone. It is a ""feel good"" story and the most amazing thing about it is that it is true and Carl is a real person. Mike Hazard did an amazing job of compiling various aspects of Carl's life into a powerful, thought-provoking film. I highly recommend this documentary to anyone of any age!",1281830400,3,1535,4.464285714285714
