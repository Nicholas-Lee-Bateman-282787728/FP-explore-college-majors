8456835,4,B0054PSY1I,"A good set of DVDs with a lot of old TV.shows. If you've also been buying the Treeline and Mill Creek DVD sets, this one actually has quite a few episodes not duplicated in the older sets; 13 of the 20 episodes are new ones (at least to me).

The prints used for this set are all in pretty decent shape, too. At this price and with Prime, it's a win-win for any fan!",1426550400,4,366,3.945945945945946
