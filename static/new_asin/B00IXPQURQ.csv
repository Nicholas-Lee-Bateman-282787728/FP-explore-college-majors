6303956,1,B00IXPQURQ,"I should know better. I bought this at WalMart on a whim. It soundd interesting. I brought it home and noticed it was from Asylum...""Oooooh noooooo!"" It's horrible. The plot, or what there is of it is convoluted, the film is edited horribly, the acting is bad and it is sillier that even ""The Creeping Terror."" However, unlike that film, this one isn't even unitentionally funny. No spoilers here...just DON'T BUY IT. It's as bad as ""Alien Origins,"" if not worse. I wish I could get my money and sleep time back.",1404259200,,512,4.576086956521739
6303957,1,B00IXPQURQ,"This movie is juvenile, the plot is silly, the acting is poor (I won't blame the actors for this one, no one could have pulled this off), the dialog is bad, there is no character development, special effects were poor, the stunts were laughable, etc., etc. Basically, an asteroid is on a collision course with Earth. We have 48 hours to stop it. Good thing we have a super secret militarized shuttle available--and a firefighter running around trying to save his daughter. Of course, everyone one knows that when we have an asteroid inbound, were going to send up a crack team of commandos (who always seem to act like Junior High School kids) rather than, oh let's say, astronauts. And the only one who can pull it off is a disgruntled/disgraced Marine Captain who had to be forcibly recalled to service. Anyway it turns out that the asteroid is an alien base for launching killer/transporter drones against Earth. Yes, Killer/Transporter drones. Sometimes they blow holes through people; sometimes they hit them with a transporter beam that sends them through a wormhole to their home world. The prisoners are strapped to tables or thrown into chambers for assorted tortures and murder. The whole thing was so silly that I did not even try to figure out the why. Our commandos somehow figure out the transporter thing and end up on the alien world. Long story short, they all die but not before they transmit the secret about the transporter beams (and it was a long path to the dying). We counterattack by sending a squad to the alien world--one very lightly equipped squad against a planet, sounds fair. Since our weapons are useless against the alien armor it was a good thing that they also took an axe-armed firefighter along. Turns out the axe is mightier than the assault rifle and that firefighters make better killers than trained soldiers. Enough said. The DVD is sitting in my garage sale pile.",1404000000,7,1907,4.781818181818182
6303958,3,B00IXPQURQ,"May contain some midpoint plot spoilers, but I would never ever reveal this ending.

We find out from the general (Robert Picardo) that ""the big one"" is headed for the planet. Since Bruce Willis died the last time, this leaves loose cannon Capt. James Wheeler (Anthony Marks) who is a bad impersonation of Charlie Sheen impersonating Tom Cruise. Col. Mac (Mitchell Carpenter), a man who acts like Lou Diamond Phillips on a bad day, has his doubts and has no trouble talking about Capt. Wheeler when he is in the room. Wheeler demands his own team which he so originally calls ""Rough Necks."" The general explains ""the gravity of the situation"" that Asylum regular, Casper Van Dien is working on his own film and can't lead the attack.

As it turns out the meteor is actually an invading worm-holed space ship filled with predator looking creatures along with a big brain bug thing that I have no idea what it was. It also worm holes back to the alien home planet...out in the blue flora woods.

Meanwhile, War of the Worlds is happening on earth as their drones attack us. As in any Asylum film dad must unite with his family or in this case his daughter who was ""not that hot."" Dad (Lane Townsend) is a crackerjack LA fireman who wields an axe in a manner that would make Kane Hodder or Gunnar Hansen green with envy. It seems he can kill these drones with an axe while the military is helpless against them with dumb things like tanks and bazookas. The drones generally strike from a distance, unless you are holding an axe, then they come up close. Daughter Lindsey (Taylor Coliee) another poorly developed character, is trapped in a cubicle (welcome to the club.)

The dialogue wasn't great:

Opening line, dad on phone to ex-wife: ""I didn't leave her by herself...The dog is with her.""

Lindsey: ""What are they?""
Dad: ""They're dead, because I'm coming to get you.""

When I saw this Asylum film in Walmart for $9.96, I had to get it right away and watch it. The film previews for other Asylum films were impressive. They do make great previews. The gag reel was about 2 minutes and not worth watching.

Asylum film fans have one for the collection. Everyone else, you have been warned.

6303962,1,B00IXPQURQ,"In a moment of desperation... I guess that is my only excuse for watching this train wreck of a sci-fi movie. Implausible and unlikely are the first words that came to my mind watching this. Take the alien soldiers ( think of  ant hierarchy),  our heroes are unable to kill them with rock drilling lasers or with bullets from assault rifles. Yet two main characters, the captain and the fire chief, manage to kill them with a knife and an ax. Amazingly, every time the fire chief kills one of the soldier class you hear squishy noises but when the ax reappears on the screen it is self cleaning. Not a drop of alien gore can soil this ax. It is like one of those 'as seen on TV' wonder gadgets. At the risk of spoiling it for you, saving you the agony of deciding whether to turn it off or not, everyone seems to fail in the end and get killed by the aliens, even our heroes. We're left with the realization that the alien queen is still going to save her dying race by munching humans to build up her strength. Save your sanity and save a bunch of time by watching something better.",1520726400,,1083,4.252427184466019

6303968,1,B00IXPQURQ,"Three stars?  Six bucks?  It's not worth what I paid on Netflix, that is, zero.  This ""movie"" is just plain dreadful and not in the memorable and fun way, say, Dusk 'til Dawn is.  If the idea was to satirize Star Wars and disaster movie clichs, it failed.  It's more like Hot Shots played straight.  As for the ""plot,"" what's weird is I know exactly how to defeat the aliens, and it's not with a fire ax.  (I'm not making this up.)  But the dim-witted characters can't figure it out even though the story spells it out in some detail.  Most just recite their lines as if reading from a teleprompter.  Robert Picardo seldom gets up from a seated position.  I wondered if his holographic emitter was broken.  He was so much fun in Star Trek: Voyager as the holographic doctor.  His stilted delivery fit the robotic character.  Now it's come to this.  My advice to him: Dinner theater would be less embarrassing.  I only gave it one star since negative two isn't possible.

6303969,5,B00IXPQURQ,"I picked up a copy at a second-hand store for the princely sum of $1 after I saw that Robert Picardo was it, as I thought he did a great job in 'Star Trek: Voyager' (by far my favourite Trek series), notably in the 'Latent Image', 'Living Witness' and 'Real Life' episodes. 'Age of Tomorrow' was a real hoot thanks to the hilariously cheap special effects, fogged up visors, cheesy dialog, etc. I enjoyed it more than any other film Ive seen this year. I saw it with my nephew and we had a great time. We burst out laughing when we heard Picardo say The sheer size of it; now one of my favourite movie quotes along with Badge? We don't need no stinkin badge! and Game over man, game over! How he kept a straight face is beyond me.",1470355200,2,730,4.184397163120567

6303974,1,B00IXPQURQ,"This movie has all the elements of an epicly horrible film.  Terrible acting, a horrific script with plot lines leading nowhere, completely unbelievable sets, characters that are so devoid of any real human emotion or depth that you really don't care if they live or die, and an ending that's really not an ending.  I watched this film on Netflix and I still didn't get my money's worth.  It felt like watching some sort of Armageddon, Starship Troopers, Sharknado, Independence Day, Aliens, Lord of the Rings, Wizard of Oz, Predators, Langoliers, B-movie mash-up. I know that sounds like a mouthful but write those titles down then watch it because it's all there, seriously.  Then there are the props.  And they get pretty bad.  From fluorescent lighting on the alien home world all the way down to nerf guns and silly string(yeah, the stuff that comes in aerosol cans).  I suppose, in the end, that I did in one way enjoy this film... spotting all the crappy stuff about it. It's kinda like a big ""Where's Waldo.""  If you decide to watch it even after the warnings of how bad it is, see what's the stupidest thing you can find. STUPID, STUPID, STUPID.",1457222400,3,1154,4.678217821782178
6303975,2,B00IXPQURQ,"I was hoping for a mildly entertaining Asylum adventure in space, as the brief story description on the box sounded promising. But unfortunately this turned out to be one of the lesser Asylum titles of late. And I'm not talking about the special effects which are actually pretty good, and the Blu-Ray DTS-HD MA audio, which is possibly the best I have heard from The Asylum. What let the film down (the part that really matters), was the story and the lazy, careless and rushed manner in which it was delivered to the audience. Moments that could have been exciting, like the discovery of a portal to the alien's home world, simply fell flat as the characters weren't given an opportunity to react or explore or see anything much except a purple landscape and a busy city in the distance. The film spends too much time concentrating on small things like a father/daughter relationship but doesn't develop either character well enough for the viewer to care about them. Some of the acting is quite good (Eg. Robert Picardo) and some is Asylum average with bad choices made for the 'hero' team sent into space who are particularly unconvincing. It also doesn't help to see badly fitting uniforms and plenty of wonky props. And with a decent 90 minutes to use, the ending was extremely disappointing, as the story literally stopped and that was it.",1456531200,4,1346,4.756410256410256
6303976,1,B00IXPQURQ,"Okay. First of all the synopsis that Amazon thoughtfully provided for this pile of crap didn't come close to what it was actually about. Then there was the bad acting. Don't get me started. The drones were cool and I also liked the whole zap em/teleport em thing but overall Age was a mess. Gotta love the ineptitude of the soldiers though,there were at least two instances where they shot their own accidentally. Dead. And the ending didn't even make any sense!

8646126,1,B00IXPQURQ,"A particulary loathsome, low-budget combination of ""Armageddon,"" ""Independence Day"" and ""Battle Los Angeles,"" except without the action, intelligence or humor.

This is an awful Asylum direct-to-disk apocalypse movie that is SO BAD, everybody from the writers and the director to the cast and crew must surely have KNOWN the project was dead-on-arrival.  Asylum usually knows how to handle a horrible idea; their best stuff counter-balances a terrible concept and script with a deluge of campy, wink-at-the-camera humor and sight gags, which makes many of Asylum's worst projects surprisingly successful.

But that's where ""Age of Tomorrow"" goes tragically wrong: It's a horribly-conceived and horribly-executed pile of rubbish with ZERO sense of humor to compensate for its many, many failings.  In other words, ""Age of Tomorrow"" is a dung-heap that takes itself far too seriously.",1521763200,,882,5.609022556390977

In response, while 8 human space fighters destroy the asteroid/spaceship despite opposition from several dozen alien space fighters, another team composed of 7 soldiers armed with handguns and assault rifles, plus one firefighter armed with an ax (no kidding), launch a rescue mission to the alien planet. The most effective at killing aliens is the guy with the ax. In the end, they fail spectacularly and everybody dies, including the people they were trying to rescue. Maybe next time they should send only firefighters with axes.",1521331200,,847,4.93006993006993
