8129499,5,B000G8NYK4,"A great kid/adventure film.  It teaches the lesson of friendship over all else.  One boy is Catholic and the other Protestant in 1970 North Ireland.  Regardless, they have a great adventure as best friends.  If you are familiar with ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid"" it will have you howling with laughter.  Another great UK movie not available in US format.  Absolutely recommended!",1323734400,4,386,5.0476190476190474
