8314833,4,B001KEGTXC,Its prettygood but however loose mostly every match on this DVD it was entertaining though but I wish they put more matches that he won,1361836800,2,135,4.44
8314834,5,B001KEGTXC,"I've been watching wrestling of late and can't get enough Necro Butcher. He puts everything into a match and he knows a hold or two plus i've seen over twenty or so Butcher matches and yet to see him botch moves like so many of my other hardcore favorites like Sabu or Sandman. I'm sure he has a botch or two but not as bad as Sabu. Anyways, I didn't want to spend the cash but I wanted this dvd and it's quite a steep price. However, I got it in an auction for a little cheaper then on here. Anyways, I love this dvd and i'll try not to wear it out because I don't want to buy another copy.

The first dvd is a one hour interview with the Necro Butcher. He just seems like a good guy and you want to go drink a beer with. Alot of stuff he said about growing up a wrestling fan reminded me of myself expect for being a wrestler. The matches are insane, some of the best hardcore wrestling around. Yes, i've searched plenty of places for hardcore wrestling and this set is by far one of the best. The way this guy wrestles is just amazing. While I could see him in a jobber/comedy role in WWE, I highly doubt Vince will ever give this guy a try out.

If your a hardcore wrestling fan, then this set is for you. However, it's out of print and really expensive. I do recommend it if you have some extra cash.",1345075200,,1305,4.015384615384615

8314837,5,B001KEGTXC,"If you know anything about the Necro Butcher and the matches he's been involved in, the question of ""what the heck is this guy thinking?"" has probably crossed your mind at least once. This DVD provides a bit of insight to the man behind the persona and how he got to where he is today.

The interview with Necro (Real name Dylan Summers) is about an hour long and briefly touches on every major step he's taken in his career. He seemed a little apprehensive at first, but he noticeably loosened up after a few minutes and the rest of the interview was pretty entertaining. He talks about his first exposure to the sport of Pro Wrestling, who he looked up to growing up, how he trained to become a wrestler, and all the companies he's worked with since the start of his career. He also does some word association pertaining to a few of his fellow wrestlers and the experiences he's had working with them. Overall I felt the interview was pretty good, though I wish it would have been a little longer. Also, there is only 1 scene of match footage (a very brief one at that) used during the entire interview and the rest is simply him being interviewed in front of a camera, so the interview is best ""viewed"" when doing something else as it's more of something to listen to than it is to watch. I'd give just the interview a solid 4 stars, but I'm rating this 2-DVD set 5 stars because of all the bonus matches that are included.

The matches themselves are all great; pretty much what you'd expect from a Necro Butcher match. Some of the earlier ones that were shot in smaller venues aren't exactly crystal-clear, but it's only 1 or 2 and it doesn't hinder the match quality at all. What I was more surprised about, though, is how many matches that were included that I hadn't seen. I don't have any DVDs that are from single Pay Per Views, but I do have a sizable amount of deathmatch compilations. To my surprise, I don't think there was a single match on either of these DVDs that I already had on another compilation (I fully expected to have at least 1 due to owning the entire ""Best of Deathmatch Wrestling"" series which includes numerous Necro matches), and I was glad that was the case. It also included a few matches that weren't deathmatches, and they were very entertaining as well. Below is a list of all the included matches (though not where they took place or at what event).

DVD 1:

Vs. Mean Mitch Page
Vs. Ian Rotten
Vs. Mad Man Pondo
Vs. JC Bailey
Vs. Toby Klein
Vs. Corp. Robinson vs. Brandon Prophet
Vs. Tank

DVD 2:

Vs. Gypsy Joe
Vs. The Green Phantom
Vs. Samoa Joe
W/ Toby Klein vs. The H8 Club
Vs. Low Ki
W/ Toby Klein vs. Vulgar Display of Power
Vs. Eddie Kingston
Vs. LuFisto
Vs. Freakshow
Vs. Masada
Vs. Mad Man Pondo (different match from the first DVD)
Vs. Brain Damage
Vs. Zandig

All in all, I felt this DVD was well worth the money I spent on it. If you're interested in learning a bit more about Dylan Summers the calm, humble family man, this is the product for you. If you want to see the Necro Butcher at his finest, this is also the product for you. If you're interested in learning about both like I was, you couldn't really ask for more from a 2-DVD set. I'd gladly recommend this to anyone who enjoys Necro's work, deathmatches in general, or just wants to know what is going through a guy's mind as he realizes a large chunk of his arm is missing after being superplexed through a lighttube structure. :) Enjoy!",1279152000,3,3451,4.366043613707165
