6282176,4,B00IN5W91M,"This comedy/fantasy holds up very well, thanks to clever dialogue and situations...and, of course, the presence of William Powell in his sophisticated wonderful vein. Some muddle in the script if you think too hard...but just let it all go and  have fun.  A middle age man's 'fantasy(?) is nice company to enjoy.",1419206400,6,312,4.980769230769231

I love this movie! The fantasy end is so enjoyable. Doesn't matter that it is black and white. This does not need color to mesmerize you.",1417392000,10,303,4.1525423728813555

8643539,5,B00IN5W91M,"I am not saying that I am fifty or anything like that, but I can relate to this movie. It makes you want to take up fishing. And William Powell portrays Mr. Peabody as well if not better than he does Nick Charles. Ann Blyth as Lenore the Mermaid does not have much to say but you understand her very well. This was filmed on location at Weekiwachee Spring, Florida. I have watched this so many times that I do not have to look up any more, even though I do. I also like all the scenes in the Psychiatrist's office.

Mr. Peabody is turning fifty. Everyone seems to remind him of this. On a vacation he captures a mermaid. So he says. However everyone else decides it is the ""fifty"" thing except the psychiatrist that wants to know what test line he used when he snagged her.

Be sure to read the book also Peabody's Mermaid by Guy and Constance Pearce Jones.",1511740800,,857,4.251533742331288
