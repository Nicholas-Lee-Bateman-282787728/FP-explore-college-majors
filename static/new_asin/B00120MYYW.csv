Okay, theres a video compilation (Goldfish) (albeit in UK video PAL format) and a live Priest = Aura concert (appalling - give it a miss)

But I think this is a very good show. With some truly oddball choices (Dylan? Velvets?)

A very good selection though. Tristesse (from Heyday) Almost with you (Blurred Crusade) the early hit single (in Australia) Electric Lash. Don't Look Back (Blurred Crusade). Hotel womb & Under the milky way from Starfish. Comedown (from Magician among the spirits). Just for you is a nice way to end the show (another from Blurred Crusade).

I could spend all day thinking of other songs he gave a miss to (what? no Shadow Cabinet?)

And if you're just getting into the Church, heaven help you. The Under the Milky Way compilation is a good way to start. But that has some curious omissions (what, no To Be In Your Eyes? or A New Season?)

I'll take what I can get though. So although I'm upset Steve didn't play Myrrh on his 12 string here, I'm glad to hear Don't Look Back

Its still very strange that there isn't much on dvd of this remarkable band. I understand Kilbey has several solo albums,as well as doing painting, although at the moment solo wise I've only heard a Koppes solo album (From the well)(quite good). Then there are the other side projects like Jack Frost and so forth. Although the band never did gain a massive following Stateside (Under the Milky Way went top 40, and that was it really for the hits) the band still tour and record

All of their albums are worth getting, in my opinion. Listen, if you're a Church fan, you're probably gonna have to buy this. Then buy Gold Afternoon Fix, Sometime anywhere, Magician among the spirits, Hologram of Baal, After everything now this, Heyday, Starfish, Priest = Aura, The Blurred Crusade, Skins and Heart..

That is, assuming you don't already have all these..

That the band has never really achieved massive success is just one of those things.. Warm Spell, Antenna, Paradox, the Feast.. these are just lovely songs, and its just a shame more people haven't heard of the band

Thank you",1224979200,11,2512,5.38265306122449
8243385,5,B00120MYYW,"Steve Kilbey live in 2007 is an incredibly impressive DVD. The Church lead vocalist and lyricist allows his resonant and dreamy vocals to take center stage. His guitar playing augments the wide variety of Church, solo and cover songs that are wondrously performed with grace. I was so happy to know that one of my favorite musical icons is still in prime form. In actuality, The Church and Steve Kilbey are better now than ever. They have been rock's greatest pyschedelic band since Pink Floyd.",1212883200,4,494,4.823529411764706
8243386,5,B00120MYYW,"If - like me - you're a fan of The Church - you'll love the 19 songs on this DVD by their frontman Steve Kilbey.
Kilbey performs some really nice acoustic interpretations of a lot of the great Church songs, live Under The milky Way, Almost With You, and Hotel Womb.
Some of the in-between song banter by Kilbey reveals he's quite a comic - and there are some nice stories along the way.
He also looks and sounds great.",1203724800,4,418,4.2375
