5733638,2,B00CPTUN5G,"My daughters and I being big fans of the show, I thought this would be the perfect movie to get for them.  We already have the Canterlot Wedding episodes on DVD as well as several of their favorite episodes always on the DVR.

I thought the R rating was a mistake, but because the cover looked a bit... grim and frightening, I decided to check it out first before I gave it to the girls.  All I can say is that I am SO GLAD I did!

While it was a good (maybe even great) movie on its own, with really a surprisingly sophisticated and even sometimes unflinchingly harsh story, it is not suitable for kids.  The scenes of executions and mass graves went on for simply far too long, and the whole brutalization on Fluttershy thing (especially all of the pseudo-sexual stuff- ick!), I could have done without.  Even with the amazing story arc with Rainbow Dash bringing her back from the brink, I still thought it was really too much, but that's just me.  And I thought the Big Mac stuff could have been cut significantly.  It was really cool, but it didn't seem to advance the story that much.

Great writing and stunning voice work, but just way too grown-up for my kids.  It will be going in our (my wife's and mine) personal collection till the girls get a lot older.

5733639,4,B00CPTUN5G,"There is, in many circles, a certain preconceived notion of the My Little Pony franchise. This film blew away mine.

Faulkner once wrote that the  only thing worth writing about was the human heart in conflict with itself. If there were one reason why I gave this five out of five stars, it is because of how well the writing explored the tension between Twilight Sparkle's conscience and the pressures of an increasingly dystopic and totalitarian Equestria.

In only 72 minutes, the film succeeds in balancing a dark personal drama against a larger story of the redemption of Equestria.

The film is definitely not suitable for children. The film plunges into the depths of human depravity, utilizing some imagery that was hard to watch. The violence may have been a card played too often and too enthusiastically, with brutal decapitations and firing squads, but it did provide a beautifully poignant contrast to the friendship of the heroines.

Tara Strong turns in a solid performance as Twilight Sparkle, somewhat reminiscent of Anne Hathaway's Fantine--the tragedy and suspense of the character build upon each other marvelously. I was less certain about the casting choice of Christopher Lee as Princess Celestia, who had in past installments been portrayed by Nicole Oliver, but his gripping voice lends a certain weight to the role, which befits the overall tone of the piece. Surprisingly, it was Peter New as Big Macintosh who delivered the most dynamic and electrifying performance, turning what may have been dull, extensive dialogue into memorable and inspiring soliloquies that really drove home the message of the film.

Although it was at times heavy-handed, it avoided resorting to clich or coming off as manipulative (or abusive, in the more gruesome scenes) of the viewer's emotion. It treats the darker subjects with respect, but gravity. The cast performed wonderfully. In all, it is a solidly great film, worthy of inclusion in any serious film enthusiast's collection.",1369180800,29,1992,5.170807453416149
5733640,5,B00CPTUN5G,"Title: My Little Pony: Fall
Genre: Drama/Psychological/Action
Company: Shout! Factory
Format: Movie, 72 Minutes
Dates: 06 Aug 2013

Synopsis: The feeling of happiness must zero out with the feeling of sorrow. Princess Celestia understood this, but she knew that she could not prevent the tides of despair from spreading upon the world eventually. Beyond Equestria lies a hell that should not be known to exist, but the curiousity of Equestria cannot be satiated. As Twilight Sparkle and her friends discover what lay beyond Equestria, the world will subsequently realize its true nature.

The Highlights:
Characters: Down to earth and incredibly real.
Symbolism: Unbelievably unique and powerful.
Pacing: Doesn't skip a beat.
Animation: Flawless.
Ending: Cathartic and Bittersweet.

Although some parts of the world are calm and soothing, there will never be world peace, and the struggles we must face are overiterated in comparision to the horrors others must fight from the day they are born. So who would have thought that a light franchise like My Little Pony would have the guts to bring this theme to life, and would do it in such a graceful way? I understand that a 10/10 review is something that should not be taken lightly, but this piece of artwork is something that should not be taken light, either. No matter what had come before this movie, the expectations of the general populace had been next to none. So that something like this would come from the My Little Pony Franchise is superlatively incredible. You may understand as you continue to read this review. I know I did.

The first thing you should probably take from this movie is that the characters become more real and believable in this movie. Even characters like Pinkie Pie or Fluttershy seem to have some levity to the way they act and think, to the point in which the story presented becomes all the more tragic and heartaching. For example, there is no forced characterization in this movie, as, even when the characters are not shown as much, they show natural development through the natural order of life. I did not, for one second, question the logic or the writing, as the characters showed humanity, mind the ironic choice of diction, in every single action. They screwed up, quite often I may add, and they were not without flaws, tragic flaws that prevented them from reaching the simple goals that they felt they could reach. Twilight Sparkle particularly shines in her flaws, as she adds fuel to the fire of an already horrifying situation, even if her intention is the exact opposite. This is because she is strict and pedantic, and she fails to understand the mental limits that seperates her from the other characters. This form of characterization is something that has never been seen before in any My Little Pony work, and succeeds in every way possible.

This isn't to say that MLP: Fall is a melodrama or pretentious garbage that only intends to milk tears (and money) out of the audience. Fall does indeed wrap itself around a mountain of symbolism, but the symbolism is creative and thoughtful enough to challenge masterpieces such as Mawaru Penguindrum and The Great Gatsby. Unlike Penguindrum, Fall presents its symbolism in relation to a concrete theme, and unconventionally uses it to successfully amplify its theme to a point in which it connects to the audience in a heartbreaking manner. Fall is a puzzle that has yet to be solved, but its theme is universal and timeless, and conveyed in a manner that, without the brilliant symbolism, likely wouldn't be nearly as effective otherwise.

The thing about symbolism and realism is that it cannot be taken at face value unless the story is presented in a solid and steadbeat manner. Fortunately for MLP: Fall, the pacing is about as perfect as it can get, despite the short time-span of the movie. The events flow out like water but never overcomplicate, only adding more levity and style to the mystery that is Fall. I have never seen a single production pace a piece of writing so well with so many events yet such a small timespan. It oh-so-effectively goes out of its way to show the how the limit of mentality has no relevance to reality, and that life is cruel enough to break one within hours. The writers went way out of their way to make such a quality script within such little time. One wonders the kind of budget this movie had.

The overwhelming popularity of the My Little Pony franchise obviously had some effect on the quality of the movie's animation. The budget challenges the rediculously high quality of Bakemonogatari, completely breaking the barrier of what can be done with animation. Never before has simple 2d animation been so flawless. One could watch the movie 500 times and never find a single blemish in the constant fluidity and beauty that is MLP: Fall's animation. The only complaint I have is that there are no flaws. It's no fun when I can't nitpick.

With everything else above considered, the story wraps itself around to the universal reality that life is not perfect. To enjoy a perfect life, one must shadow oneself in ignorance and cowardly hide theirself from the rest of the world. Ignorance is bliss, and mentality is a gift. Once both are lost, only the power of one's psyche can help them through the cruel reality that is life. That is why the ending is so powerful and moving, as it conveys its theme in a way that has never been respected before. It does it... perfectly.

Perfectly is an unrealistic word, but if it can apply anywhere, it's here. You will never have a writing experience more cathartic and moving than MLP: Fall, and if you can, then I would damn sure love to hear you tell the world about it, as there is likely no one on this planet who can deny the greatness that Hasbro has created out of such a simple yet beautiful franchise. My Little Pony: Fall, will forever be remembered as an unchallengable masterpiece.",1369008000,48,5936,4.794721407624634

5733704,3,B00CPTUN5G,"Right away, this has a bit of a limited audience.  This is trying to capture existing fans of My Little Pony, hot off the end of season 3, and make a high school world with those characters.  This is a ""launchpad"" movie, more interested in setting a world for future movies than making itself strong.  That's not to say it fails entirely, though.  It was made so that Hasbro could have a rival to Monster High, both of which having been made to sell toys.  That said, this really took a ""Pinkie, Elmyra, & the Brain"" approach.  The writers took the baseline forced on them and still managed to make it work well.
Ok, that tangle of words done, spoiler-free summary of the plot.  Now that Twilight is royalty, she's having trouble adjusting to her new role & new body.  While she sleeps, her crown is stolen by the main antagonist, Sunset Shimmer (thus starting the tradition of ""Twilight clones""), and Sunset escapes through a magic mirror.  Sunset was a previous apprentice of Celestia, and thus far had been a prisoner in this mirror world.  Since Twilight's crown is literally her Element of Harmony (or conduit depending on your interpretation), it's crucial she gets in to retrieve it.  In this mirror world, she takes a human body in a high school setting, where everyone she knows effectively has a mirror interpretation here.  She once again has to get used a new body & new role as she figures out how things work while trying to find her crown.  She finds it's actually being used for what is effectively a prom queen prop, and if she wants it, she'll have to win it fairly.  Twilight finds all her Ponyville friends, but they somehow hate each other.  Twilight's mission now becomes two-fold: reunite the friendship they once had, and with their help, become prom queen to get her crown back.
Unfortunately, if you're not already a fan of My Little Pony, this would probably be a tall order for you to enjoy.  It requires you to know major plot points of the first 3 seasons to understand what's going on.  That said, if you ARE a fan of MLP, this highly-commercial endeavor still ends up being a big love letter to the series.  This was the first theatrical release of MLP, even if it's a non-canon side series.  Most characters make an appearance in here, even if it's just a brief cameo.  This still has a tremendous amount of world-building, making it clear this is setting up future releases.  The plot is actually pretty reasonable right until you reach the climax.  Sunset Shimmer's had a lot of sinister influence in this world, but her end goal kind of insults the intelligence she otherwise has.  It also has some a very flashy, Toei-style transformation/power-up sequence, which can be a plus if you enjoy things like Sailor Moon, Digimon, or Miraculous.
One point where I really can't complain, as usual, is the music.  The song titled ""Equestria Girls,"" basically a small pep rally in the cafeteria, has easily become one of the most iconic in the series.  Time to Come Together has become a decent motivational song for me as I prep our arcade.  This is Our Big Night, while the initial animation sequence is basically a big Barbie dress-up, has a reprise in the finale that really hits me sentimentally.
Altogether, this is a very ""style-over-substance"" feature.  It can be enjoyable, but don't expect a a lot of depth.

Unfortunately, this can be a decent feature if you enjoy My Little Pony, but otherwise not much else.  Still, for a $5 price tag, you could do much worse.",1488499200,,3501,4.647154471544716

5733740,5,B00CPTUN5G,"Camping movies in a franchise are often the weakest point or a recycle idea that seems to do nothing else but outdoors hijinks and summer camp cliques. Not the case here in this fourth entry into the Equestria Girls series, as I was actually surprise by the fun story and interesting new characters. I was actually impressive by how much I liked it that I would even debate as this being my new favorite MLP movie lately.

While the overall mystery of Evergreen will be something that older viewers will see coming the entire reason behind it is actually interesting and the culprit and motivations for it are actually emotional as this series delivers another villain with more to it than a stereotypical villain as seen in most kid's shows. Despite the drama is overall just a really fun experience as the ""Mane Six"" do just about everything to enjoy the summer with some funny results.

Pros:
1. I like the setting, the audience finally had a chance to see new scenery besides that of Canterlot High.
2. They didn't overdo with adding too many new characters. ( The problem that Friendship Games had. New characters were added but little to no development was shown). Just having the two camp directors was good enough.
3. Each of the Mane 7 getting equal amount of screen time.
4. Sci- Twi's development and overcoming her fear
5. The Wardrobe chances and different hair

Con's
1. The pacing felt a bit rushed in some areas. Mainly during the battle scene.
2. The choice of the villain. There are so many alternatives they could have used, for instance: Filthy Rich could have been an major antagonist or the actual Tree Spirited that was mentioned. You only can use the ""getting corrupted"" tactic so many times before it becomes
 old.
3. I felt the romance between Sci- Twi and Timber was a bit rushed. I mean , they only known each other for about three days and they are already thinking of dating. I'm hoping that's not the case when the holiday specials are released.
4. Not enough involvement with camp activities.

Longer version:

I...I don't even know how to comment on what I saw. But I did have some...experience, watching this movie. It is not the best of the EG mo~worst of the EG movies, and in MLP franchise in general. Basically, the movie has a pretty good concept. The camping does look variative, compared to constant in-school setting from the previous movies, and it's pretty nice. huMane 5 is still lovable gang that we love. Same can be said about our beloved Sunny. She is always sweet to see. Plus some kind of development for Flash, even if it not that special. But MY WOW, those absolute crutches that I encountered during the movie just infuriated the everlasting grind out of me. Starting with the overly lame romance between Gloriosa's brother and Sci-Twi and ending with Sci-Twi herself, recycled villain formula and lazy costume designs - that's pretty awful, you know. No, I...I...maybe I would be more willing to approach this movie more indulgently, but I cannot. I did not experience what those who praise it experienced. It's like we watched slightly 2 different movies. I just can't agree that it's good. It is not, for me. And yes, consider this the subjectivism in its entirety, because...I wish I could praise it for some things, but I'm just physically not able to do it. I went through disappointment. Through sheer disappointment and despair. As fan, Twilight Sparkle fan and SunLight shi~especially as the latter two. And I have no desire to go back to any of that.

Despite that I will take a look at what will follow, just because.

5733760,5,B00CPTUN5G,"My Little Pony has caught up with sci-fi and now has dimensions where the ponies are teenagers. WOW! This is an awesome concept! I love this colorful DVD with its amazing storyline, fantastic characters and terrific animation. This film is one of my favorites of this series. I love the story line and how it fits perfectly with the rest of the series. The animation is fantastic. I love that they mix it with a little bit of Japanese anime. It really brings this film to life.

The cast is so fun and entertaining. Twilight Sparkle (Tara Strong) is a loving main character. She shows this by helping her friends and trying to find ways to make the world a better place for everyone. She does this despite the fact that she is dealing with her evil dark side that came out in the last film. Plus, things at Camp Everfree are going wrong and strange things are happening all around camp. Sunset Shimmer (Rebecca Shoichet) is thoughtful, generous, wants to help everybody and wants to solve the mystery. She also helps Twilight Sparkle overcome her fear and gain more confidence about herself. Rainbow Dash and Applejack (Ashleigh Ball) is daring, adventurous and a total tomboy. She tries to do the most outrageous and dangerous stuff with her friends including rock climbing and archery. Applejack is brutally honest and cares deeply for everyone. She can be a bit mean at times, but she just wants you to know the truth about everything. She once told Rarity that her idea of a runway was dumb because they were in a forest and no one but her would use it. Pinkie Pie (Andrea Libman) is hyper and loves to throw parties anywhere, anytime and any place. She brings marshmallows to everything to make smores. She tries her best to be fun and bring life to the party. She even dares Rainbow to eat as many marshmallows as she can fit in her mouth in one bite while they are telling scary stories by the campfire.  Fluttershy (Andrea Libman) is shy, quiet and loves animals with all of her heart. She even goes to help a bird get back into its nest when she is in a hurry. Rarity (Tabitha St. Germain) loves to sew clothes for all her friends and is a complete girly girl at heart. She even wants a runway where she can show the other campers the clothes she has made.

Sunset Shimer is my stand out character. She wears a crown that has a spell cast on it and ends up with a demon inside her that she must fight off. Her character is compassionate. I like that she is always battling her caring side against her evil side. She is thoughtful of others. The way she tries everything in her power to help Twilight Sparkle overcome her fear is a great reminder to take good care of your friends and family, which is the theme of this film.

This is filled with magnificent songs that provide a musical theater vibe because the girls sing throughout the movie. They all have beautiful voices. You will want to learn the lyrics and sing along with them. They are so heartfelt that they really make you feel the emotions the characters are feeling.

I recommend this film for ages 7 to 16. Younger kids will love the story and fun characters. Older kids will find it inspiring. I give this 5 out of 5 pony stars

5733761,3,B00CPTUN5G,"Thank you for the replacement, but I was suggesting that you may wish to contact Hasbro and have them fix the problem, as when I got the second copy the same problem was there. The daylight scenes are too bright and the characters with lighter coloring like Rarity and applejack sort of bleed into the background. It is a programming error, as I suspected, and also happened on the second disc. To be fair I did ask you specifically to check that before sending me another copy. Again I appreciate it, but sending me a second copy of something that's flawed from the production does not really solve the problem. however i cannot fault your customer service and than you for the attempt.",1478908800,,687,4.59349593495935

So, here is the story. Twilight is having a very important day. so she goes to bed. and while she is sleeping, a bacon hai- i mean, a pony named sunset shimmer steals her crown. twilight starts yelling ""HEY HEY HEY HEY HEY HEY! SHES GOT MAH CROWN!"" ok, she didn't say that like i spelled it, but she wakes up everypony. Sunset drops the crown in the portal and runs after it. Twilight goes into the portal to retrieve it, and she re-meets her friends, but there is too much goin' on. They are  arguing, doing gross girly stuff, like talking about a boy named Flash Sentry (who has TERRIBILE character development btw) so, sunset turns into a jelous bacon monster and gets blasted by rainbow lights. twilght floats out of the portal and..... what did i just watch? I would not reccomend this to kids (even though i am a kid using my dads account) because i fell off my bed when sunset turned evil.......",1457654400,,1069,4.36180904522613
5733793,3,B00CPTUN5G,"This was the first movie this generation of My Little Pony ever got.  Unfortunately, the setting is not great.  Hasbro made no secret about the fact that this was made simply so that they could compete with Monster High, as children's entertainment is all about selling toys (see the debacle over Young Justice for evidence).  This movie takes place soon after Twilight Sparkle is promoted, and she's getting used to her new wings.  As she's visiting the Crystal Empire, her crown (the element of magic) is stolen by Sunset Shimmer, and she escapes through a magical mirror.  This is unfortunately very much like a fanfic would set up an entrance to a mirror universe.  Now Twilight has to deal with a human body and a world where everyone she knows doesn't know her at all.
Taken with some suspension of disbelief, this movie plays ok for the most part.  It goes a long way to set up the premise that Twilight basically has to be voted prom queen over the currently dominating Sunset Shimmer, but the campaign to do so works out fairly nicely.  The music, as usual, is absolutely amazing!  The characters still mostly reflect how their original counterparts are.  It's definitely a thing that any fan of My Little Pony will enjoy.  The plot just needs to be stronger, especially the climax.  When Sunset finally reveals her ultimate plan, you just have to be stunned at how poor it really is.  There's also a romantic subplot between Twilight & another new character, Flash Sentry.
Ultimately, this is basically just for people who are already fans of My Little Pony.  The only thing I really take out of it is the amazing music.  Fans will enjoy looking for their favorite characters to make an appearance.  There are many things I could nitpick about it, such as the new characters both colored yellow to more closely look like Caucasian people in a world full of many different colored people.  However, it's very self-aware of its commitment to the fans and works very hard to deliver what they expect.  Do not use this to introduce My Little Pony to anyone, but if they're already into it, this will probably go a long way.",1457395200,,2129,4.67741935483871

5733829,4,B00CPTUN5G,"Although the ""My Little Pony"" brand has been around since the 80s, it wasn't until it's newest incarnation, ""Friendship is Magic"", that the toyline-turned-TV show saw an explosion of popularity all around the world, with it's complex and relatable characters, eye catching artwork, great music, and mythical world that would put The Lord of the Rings to shame. So when fans began drawing artwork of what they would imagine the ponies to look like as regular humans, the showrunners took notice and thought, ""hmm, that must be what the fans want, so let's give it to them"". Add to the fact that Hasbro's competitor, Mattel, is producing both Barbie and Monster High, and you can imagine that Hasbro also wanted to jump on the bandwagon of producing unconventional dolls.  This mixture led to the creation of this movie...a film that many fans, including me, were hesitant about. After loving the ponies and their magical world, would such characters translate well to a regular, human world? Was it an idea even worth doing?

While I still prefer our favorite characters as ponies, this movie is surprisingly good, showing us an interesting alternate universe that will no doubt be visited again.

Taking place directly after the events of Season 3, Twilight Sparkle has just been crowned as a new princess of Equestria. But shortly after, during the night, her crown (containing the Element of Magic), is stolen by Sunset Shimmer--a jealous, former student of Princess Celestia's. She makes her escape through a magic mirror, which is revealed to be a gateway to an alternate universe that no pony (save for Sunset) has ever set foot in. With Spike the Dragon in tow, Twilight jumps into the mirror....and finds herself turned into a human girl (and Spike into a puppy). With no magic at her disposal, Twilight must navigate this strange new dimension where Canterlot is now a high school, and all her friends and neighbors are students, teachers, and other staff there....and she must act quickly, for the gateway back to her own world will close in just a matter of days.

The plot is very much like the Wizard of Oz, but in reverse, where instead of the normal person going to the magical world, it's the other way around. Twilight having to learn how to navigate without magic...and with hands instead of hooves, and walking on two feet, leads to both awkward and hilarious situations. It's also fun to play the ""Where's Waldo"" game, and point out all of the various background ponies of the show, but in human form. Some fans felt that having Technicolor humans was weird, but I myself think it was a wise choice. For one thing, it makes spotting the characters easier, and for another, there's no argument as to what ethnicity/race any of the characters are. Twilight isn't white, or black, or Indian, or Asian....she's purple, and that's fine by me.

Getting back to the plot, however, it's plays to many high school tropes, with Sunset Shimmer being the bully/Queen bee of the school, and Twilight as the newcomer/underdog who's going to take her down at the prom/dance....but with the added twist of her having to retrieve a magical item in a short amount of time. Her Mane 5 friends, in this universe, are bitter enemies who must learn the magic of friendship through Twilight, leading to a ""Sailor Moon""-inspired finale that'll make any fans of the magical girl genre happy. And in the process, Twilight must also learn what it really means to be a princess and leader, especially when confronting the angry and jealous Sunset, who can't understand why she was passed over for princess-hood back in Equestria.

Many fans originally thought that ""Equestria Girls"" was going to be a spin off TV show, but thankfully, it seems the creators are just sticking to movie releases. And in a way, I'm glad. Without Twilight introducing magic to this world, I think a show like this would be rather boring. It would pretty much be another standard high school show on the lines of ""Recess"" or ""Doug"" without the fantastic element. However, keeping the two worlds separate, and just taking the occasional peek into this alternate universe is nice enough. It's an interesting, fan-servicing experiment that will no doubt be revisited more than a few times.",1445299200,,4255,4.878284923928078

5733832,5,B00CPTUN5G,"A touching movie that explores Twilight Sparkle's character (gives her a sense of struggle and conflict).

I don't get the dislike for this movie. It does a great job at exploring Twilight's character.

This movie takes place just after Season 3 but just before Season 4. At the end of Season 3, Twilight becomes an Alicorn and in this movie, you get to see how she deals with it a little (the first 5 minutes or so of the movie) and then later how she deals this new world and how she tries to solve things in that (Equestria Girls) world.

I am making this review after seeing all three Equestria Girls movie so far (2015). I know some fans don't like the movie but honestly, I don't understand why. The movie does a great job at exploring Twilight's character (at least the first half).

Now I admit that in the second half, the sense of struggle with Twilight is gone but I still appreciate the movie for adding more depth to Twilight's character.

Personally I love this movie because it touched me.

The scene that did it (some minor spoilers) is the scene where Twilight couldn't figure out how to use a vending machine and she looked so sad and said how she didn't know much about this world or if she can find a way this time. Another scene was when Twilight wasn't sure whether the others would believe she is a Pony Princess.

Those two scenes alone (alone with the rest of the movie) made the movie worth it. It adds a lot to Twilight's character. You get to see another side (well you do sometimes in FIM but not as much) of Twilight. You feel her struggles and you want her to succeed.

In the regular MLP: FIM show, I find that characters aren't explored (in terms of conflict) as much The movie does a great job with exploring Twilight and giving her a conflict that she kind of struggles with (something that shows another side of Twilight that isn't as explored as much).

I admit though, Twilight only kind of struggles during the first half of the movie. The second half kind of doesn't have as much sense of a conflict or struggle (but it's still touching all the way through). Regardless though, I found the movie enjoyable throughout.

One negative though is that there is a few dull moments in the movie but I'd say the majority of the movie is enjoyable.

Personally, I like it more than Rainbow Rocks and it is equal with Friendship Games. The problem I have with Rainbow Rocks is that while there is more things happening (and more characters), there isn't as much sense of progression in conflict.

The majority of Rainbow Rocks were characters arguing (or aimlessly trying to find some way to win against the Sirens), then near the end of the movie there was a 2 minute pep talk that suddenly switched things around and let the Mane Six + Sunset Shimmer win. That's why I don't like Rainbow Rocks as much (I did enjoy it though). Not only that, (personally) Rainbow Rocks didn't really show a specific character struggling in the way that it touched me (and I wanted them to win). IMO, both Equestria Girls (this movie) and Friendship Games does a better job at that than Rainbow Rocks. I rate Rainbow Rocks 4/5 though, it was still enjoyable but personally I didn't like it as much as the other two.

Overall, that's why I give this movie a 5/5. It does a great job at exploring Twilight Sparkle's character.",1443312000,2,3338,4.479406919275124

The music in it is AWESOME too and so is the new character Sunset Shimmer. It's great for kid and adult fans. Plus we do get to see them as ponies for the first 9 minutes of the film before they become humans, more than in Rainbow Rocks.

Well done animation, like the show counterpart, nicely done musical numbers, even if they are few and far between, and of course, good characters. There are some cliched parts to the story, but aside from a few moments, it's a very very enjoyable movie for ponyfans, animation enthusiasts, and bronies, of course.
The Blu-ray itself is BEAUTIFULLY put together, with priceless art printed onto the disc, inside cover art, and a wonderful embossed slip-cover.

Whereas ""Friendship Is Magic"" concerns magic and fantasy and dragons and adventure, the cross over into the world of creepy looking human-pony hybrids changes the conflict to ""who will ask me to prom?""

5733947,4,B00CPTUN5G,"The first installment in the spinoff to ""My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic"", this film sees heroine and freshly-crowned princess Twilight Sparkle (voiced by Tara Strong) faced with retrieving her crown and Element of Harmony from Sunset Shimmer (Rebecca Shoichet). Sounds simple, but she has to go to an alternate world to do it - one where she's turned into a human! Thankfully for her, the magic of friendship isn't limited to just ponies.

I liked this film. Caught it in theaters, enjoyed myself a lot when I saw it. That said, it's not without it's plot holes, and it's only with the second film that we started to see patches for said plot holes. But this is essential viewing if you watch ""Rainbow Rocks"", and fun despite its flaws.",1414281600,,741,4.7
5733948,5,B00CPTUN5G,"While it's not AS good as some other animated movies, you got to give it a LOT of credit. It takes the silly and eye-rolling idea of ponies being humans and actually makes it something rather interesting. This concept was very nicely handled and opens to door for many possibilities for the Mane Six (characters). Plenty of good jokes and one or two AWESOME songs, this should become a classic amongst fans of Friendship is Magic and animation enthusiasts.

This movie doesn't have very good pacing, seeing Twilight as a human for the first time was interesting. But problems get solved almost as quickly as they arrive. (I'm looking at you, Sunset Shimmer attempting to frame Twilight for the trashing of the gym) Flash Sentry is a pointless love interest who's just there for the sake of being a pointless love interest.

5733994,5,B00CPTUN5G,"I bought this DVD because I actually really liked this movie. The concept of human versions of my favorite My Little Pony characters was just so fun to watch for me. That said, I think all of the Mane Six, Rainbow Dash and Pinkie Pie particularly look so cool and cute as humans. And I don't mind the abnormal skin colors. lol What I really like about this movie is that it shows you that friendship can triumph over evil, of course the movie portrays it in a literal sense but the concept that friendship is powerful is not fairy tale.

For the DVD itself, there are some nifty behind-the-scene features that give you an inside look on the movie, the character designs and the wonderful songs. It's a good idea to buy this movie if you are interested in learning more about the process they went through to bring Equestria Girls to life. There are also a few karaoke sing-a-longs for ""The Cafeteria Song"" (which I prefer to call ""Helping Twilight win the Crown"", just saying lol) and ""A Friend For Life"", which I think is an incredibly cheesy song but still has a nice message to it. My only complaint on these is that I wish there was an option that had the actual singing with it.

And one last thing but I think this is the case with any My Little Pony or Shout! Factory DVD is the lack of subtitles, there are times where it'd be really helpful to know what was said in a scene.",1407888000,,1383,4.315384615384615

5734017,5,B00CPTUN5G,"OK, I was really not expecting much on this one.  I saw the previews and thought, ARRRGH... how in the world is that going to work for a story line?

  Well, the opening was great... picks right up after the end of season three... so the story looked promising, at least it was showing how it could tie together.

  From there on, it just gets MUCH better!  Essentially there is an alternate universe, where everypony not only has the same names, but lives somewhat similar lives, (as far as personalities and experiences, even though things are in general much more like we experience life here...)

  I do not want to spoil the show,  but it has great music, in many ways matching, if not surpassing many of the musical highlights from the series.

  Probably the BEST thing about this video release particularly is that it was released on BLU-RAY in FULL HD!  Now if they would also release the TV series on BD here in the USA.  (so far it seems the only HD BD release of episodes is the 1st season in Germany, and WOW does it look G-O-O-D!)",1403395200,,1044,4.410526315789474

There is even a bit about forgiveness.  As per the norm in the show, there is a lot of singing and silliness (which I love).

5734077,4,B00CPTUN5G,"Yes this is long but hear me out.

Now let me start out by saying I was one of those fans that really was not looking forward to this movie at all.  But instead of being an ignorant jerk and not watch it, I decided to watch it's premiere on June 15th (contrary to advertising being the 16th, but the premiere was only at one theater in the world which was at the LA Film Festival 2013).  And boy am I glad I watched it.  This movie is the best example of a horrible plot line, but written so wonderfully.  Just talking about what happens in the movie makes me stop and ask myself ""The heck am I talking about? That sounds so lame...""  But watching it...it's completely different.  Heck I actually liked this movie so much that I watched again at a brony meetup.  And of course, pre-ordered this DVD.

NOW ONTO THE DVD ITSELF

-The Look-
The DVD is too simple, nothing elaborate on the menus, even the main one, which is kind of a disappointment but I kinda already expect some of Hasbro's MLP products to be a little cheaply made especially the DVDs.

-Setup-
Unfortunately there are absolutely no setup options.  Meaning English only, no stereo/surround sound options (which I personally don't care in any DVD), and the biggest doozy: NO SUBTITLES.  There is a scene selection, but without any video screens showing what happens, so you gotta really read the scene titles and figure it out for yourself.

-Special Features-
The features on this DVD are both disappointing, yet awesome at the same time. Some are weird videos advertising stuff like a show i never heard of, or a bunch of little girls glittering their hair or something, and a printable movie poster (and i mean like the movie posters you've seen, heck it even says 'Coming Soon June 16th')
Aside from that, They have 3 clips of talking about the making of the film (which are all short, but still give a little insight), and karaoke of 2 of the 5 songs in this film.  Thankfully 1 of them is ""Helping Twilight Win the Crown"", though on the DVD it's called ""Cafeteria Song"" and the official name is ""Equestria Girls"" as if that wasn't confusing enough.  But most people call it by its unofficial name.  And The other is ""A Friend For Life"" which plays at the credits (odd choice for karaoke).
'Tis sad there is no full-length movie commentary...but eh whatever.

All in all I was very happy with my purchase and I even watch my copy multiple times.  This movie always puts a smile on my face and always surprises me.  Even if the DVD didn't have what everybody else wanted, all that mattered to me was that I could own it personally and watch it on demand.

Why 4 stars?  4 for the DVD and 4 for the movie.  My actual rating of the film is actually 7.5/10, and in this case 3.5/5 stars.

Still go watch it...unless of course you seen seasons 1,2, and some episodes of 3 first.",1392163200,,2842,4.431599229287091

5734090,1,B00CPTUN5G,Way too scary gargoyle like villain. My 7 year old had nightmares. Also just insulting because once the ponies turn into girls their only ambition is tocan't wait to put on make up and sing a song about it. Apparently turning in,1390780800,6,228,4.4523809523809526

5734093,5,B00CPTUN5G,"As a brony I deeply enjoyed this movie. The hype is generally in the other direction, but like any episode of MLP, it wasn't cheesy or girly, it didn't go off the charts into anything more we'd expect from a series and had an applicable moral that even addresses things we ourselves and our children could learn from. Granted it wasn't the apex of the series as a whole, all it should be seen as is just a collection of 3 episodes in one. And to be enjoyed as such. Bronies, Pegasisters, and parents alike will enjoy this one.",1390348800,,526,4.3232323232323235

The movie plays like a two part episode of the show basically placing Twilight Sparkle in a situation where she must try and restore order to her world and an alternate reality (human) world.  There are catchy songs throughout, good lessons, and a villain that (sorry no spoilers).  The movie is cute and my girls sing along to it whenever they watch it now.",1390176000,,552,4.5

5734097,4,B00CPTUN5G,"A film that offers a good look at other parts of the world of My Little Pony. Though I personally wish it would've been done differently, the school context offers a good backdrop for our favorite ponies. It seems Equestria Girls is aimed at a slightly older audience than the TV-series as it deals with concepts like cliques and bullies.",1389744000,,338,4.65
5734098,5,B00CPTUN5G,"This movie is fantastic. It actually has a very, very vaguely more teenage (roughly sophomore to junior, maybe college) feel to it. ONE THING TO NOTE: if you went to the theatrical showings, you might recall hearing lines like ""She needs to die!"" or ""Stop! Thief!"", which have been turned into ""She needs to be dealt with!"". I'm guessing this was because they wanted the TV and DVD/BluRay showings to be more child friendly, while the assumption was that the older crowd from the fandom would be the ones at the theatrical showings.
There is no alternate audio, so if you like the slightly darker words that we saw in theatre (as I do), then you might be disappointed a little.
Regardless, these two little things are the only changes I've noticed, and the movie is still a LOT of fun, and absolutely worth getting.
The special features, while also fun, are a little lackluster, if only because they are so short. A lot of fun to watch, I just wish they were longer than about a minute or so in three segments total.",1389657600,,1016,4.5271739130434785

The storyline was by no means original, (crown is stolen from princess, princess ventures on a long and mysterious journey to retrieve it) which makes it lose a star. But, with the mixins of the Elements of Harmony and the big finale, it makes itself stand out from other childrens movies. So, storyline could be less ""stereotypical children's movie"", but overall, great movie. Bronies will love it. It's an MLP movie, I guess you can't expect much.

5734125,5,B00CPTUN5G,I got this for my little brony and he was excited when he opened it up. He has already seen the movie a few times on The Hub Network he now has a copy to watch anytime he wants. I just need to get the Digital copy for him to put on his Kindle or iPod so he has it with him all the time. I have read some reviews about this movie and I think at least one is greatly exaggerated. This is a great movie for any kids I have met. It holds true to the Friendship is Magic theme and isn't demonic. Only the fight at the end of the movie can remotely be considered scary but it is far from that. I would reccomend this movie to any Bronies out there.,1388102400,,642,3.762962962962963

I hope they make more equestria girls movies in the future.",1388016000,,364,4.140845070422535

Biggest problem I had with the set is that the digital copy, though I downloaded the ""Andriod/iTunes"" version of it, it took forever to get it into the iTunes format. You can do it, but it takes a fair amount of work. Overall, it was a decent buy if your kid loves my little pony!",1388016000,,515,4.009708737864078
5734128,3,B00CPTUN5G,"So this movie was a surprise. Surprisingly good and I'll admit i instantly Pre-ordered the Blu-ray as soon as I could. However i was hoping for features like on the first season DVD, commentary in particular. This release includes nothing like that (as the later season releases have lacked it as well.)

HOWEVER: for what it is this is definitely worth it. It's always been a good price and it includes the movie in a great format with spot on colors (as most people who saw it in theaters saw many theaters screwed up the projection, being such a short notice release) and the songs sound great. Strangely anyone who watches it will know that My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic is definitely supposed to be viewed in HD so this is how this movie was meant to be watched.

I'd suggest getting this over the DVD if you need a physical copy of this movie. If you don't then stick to a digital release or just catch it on the Hub or Netflix.",1387929600,,940,4.396551724137931
5734129,5,B00CPTUN5G,"+Please Note: I purchased the digital copy of the movie.  Thus, this will be more along the lines of a movie review.  If I do purchase a physical DVD copy in the future, I will be sure to update and include my impressions of the DVD features and package.+

CONTENT ISSUES:
Parents and Guardians, don't worry.  You have nothing to worry about.  This show was especially made for kids to begin with (though I'm sure you can enjoy it, too ^_^ ).  No language issues, no innuendos...it's really safe and surprisingly wholesome.

TO UNDERSTAND WHERE I'M COMING FROM...
My Little Pony (MLP) has drawn in a wide array of people and observers that few recent shows have managed to pull in.  Some have more positive views on it (the MLP franchise as a whole) and others carry more negative perspectives.  Because of this wide spectrum of biases and perspectives this specific franchise has attracted,  I figured telling you a little bit of my position and angle on the show to help you decide how much salt to take with my words.  As far as MLP is concerned, I had avoided the show until a few weeks ago.  Nothing to do with a phobia or huge dislike...it just did not interest me at all.  One boring Saturday morning, I was eating breakfast while flipping through channels and came across 2 back-to-back episodes of MLP (one of the 2-parters).  There was nothing else on and I really wanted to eat, so I figured this was as good as anything else that was on at the time.  However, the episode blew me away, first, in it's smart music writing (I'm a musician) and musical timing, then sealed the deal with a very touching narrative that did pull on the heartstrings a little.  I watched a few more episodes to see if this was a one time thing, and while there were many episodes that I could totally pass over...there were many more that dealt with hard issues (like family legacy, loyalty, the hard consequences of gossip, making hard choices, dealing with sister or brother issues, etc.), had a good narrative, and excellent use of music.  The characters and character interplay is also very smart and charming.  It's use of cultural references is pretty amusing, as well (such as homages to Top Gun, a character named ""Dr. Whooves [take a guess who that one is based off of], and others).  Now, make no mistake, this is still a kids show...but it definitely carries more meat than many other shows, today, for kids...and can still be quite humorous, refreshing, and even enriching for older folks.  Fact is, there are tons of real world issues and situations that any person of any age can relate and connect to.  I'm no avid fan, but I do find the show charming and inspiring nonetheless.  The author C.S. Lewis did say that the more he grew older, the more and more he began to enjoy the fairytales and see their depth.

BUT ANYWAYS, BACK TO THE MOVIE (ABSOLUTELY NO SPOILERS):
Equestria Girls (EG), is a non-canon film in the MLP franchise.  Basically, it will have little to no effect on the main MLP show and narrative.  Still, I found it to be a very fun film that carried the same spirit of the show and was greatly enjoyable.  In effect, though, this movie did not feel like a movie so much as it did a really long and significantly more detailed tv episode (1 hour 13 minutes to be exact).

ART STYLE:
This was a make-or-break point for some folks.  But for me, I actually liked the world designs.  It really maintained the bright, pastel world of the MLP tv show.  I even liked the the character designs.  At first, the designs did seem a little weird to me (seeing them in static form like box art and so forth), but seeing it in the context of the show, it really worked out and grew on me.  It just helped to add one more layer of connection to the franchise.  The animation was also quite smooth and seemed a little more polished than usual.  Basically, from a visual standpoint, it was believable.

PLOT (ABSOLUTELY NO SPOILERS):
The progression of the plot was actually quite smooth.  The pacing was good and did not feel, too rushed.  The script writing was good, in my opinion...though there were a few weaker points, like some of the lines in the last 3rd of the film.  Also, I liked the concept and idea of the plot line.  True, it's nothing new, but it was well executed and well thought out...and besides, nothing is ever really new.  One thing I really enjoyed most, though was how they weaved many of the various prominent themes from the show into this one...especially the idea of Friendship.  Just like the show, they aren't too preachy or heavy handed about the good messages/lessons that often drive the show.  They clearly SHOW the lesson rather than rely on solely TELLING...and that makes a significant (and positive) difference.  Plus, the way they executed it was very touching.  I found myself feeling ""warm fuzzies"" at times, and in some of the more inspiring portions of the film, found myself tingling with excitement.  There were some good laughs and moments where I couldn't help but smile.  I love stories that can move your heart and inspire you to do greater things.  Again, this is still a kids show...so don't expect an ""adult"" narrative, at all.

CHARACTERS:
The human version of the ponies are true to character.  And you'll definitely recognize them not only by look, but by their demeanor.  Their interplay with each other was also charming and helped add to the narrative.

MUSIC:
The one thing that encouraged me to give MLP a chance weeks ago was the music.  MLP has been known for smart lyrics, good musical arrangements, and a varied genre style of music (from pop and rock, down to bluegrass and Disney'esque styled dramatic pieces).  In Equestria Girls, the style stays pretty much in the pop realm.  But the songs are still good, fitting, and augment what is happening on screen.  Best part...they are smoothly and ""believably"" worked in.  It's not like, ""let's stop and sing, now"".  They professionally brought the music in a way that made you feel like it would have been wrong if they didn't.  That was my impression, anyways.

FOR THE FANS:
For you huge fans, you will definitely find a lot of amusing references as well as have a fun time playing ""guess-which-pony-that-human-is-based-off-of"". Again, I'm not an avid fan so i definitely didn't catch it all, but I do remember a few things from what episodes I have seen.  I can only expect those of you who are quite fluent with MLP to appreciate these little extra details even more than a casual viewer like myself.

ALL IN ALL:
This was a fun and enjoyable film that gave me some food for thought. It's not the deepest film are the most ground breaking film, ever.  But it still has good sustenance and is a keeper in my book.  I'm also sure that there are several faults and weaknesses of this film.  In fact, many of the other reviewers have raised good points, too.  But for me, in this one instance, the good things about the film so greatly outweighed what weaknesses there may have been that I really don't remember any blaring blemishes.  Sure, there are preferential things on my part, but nothing that can really be considered a fair critique.  The one thing I would say, though, is you would appreciate this tons more if you were familiar with the MLP ""lore"" to even the smallest degree.  Jumping cold turkey into it may leave you confused.  The film does assume that you have at least a little familiarity with its world.  Still, this is definitely a film that can be fun for the whole family and a wonderful addition to the franchise.",1387843200,2,7554,4.589992531740105

I fell in love with the series and enjoyed the songs and messages in the episodes.  So, when I saw that they did an Equestria Girls movie, I was hesitant...the ponies being turned into girls??  I laid my ears back at that, let me tell ya!  But I watched it (rented it first) curiosity winning out, and I think that this movie was absolutely adorable.  Twilight Sparkle was charming in her awkwardness and I ended up watching it two more times!  And i am in my 30s with no kids!

I was afraid they were trying to appeal to a more ""grown-up"" audience and would therefore create characters that would be inappropriate for my 5, soon to be 6, year old. To my surprise, the characters, and their morals and values, still held true. This was not a shot at appealing to an older target audience by maturing the pony girls, instead it was a classy spin-off of our much-loved My Little Pony series.

5734179,4,B00CPTUN5G,"'A lot of people think this is some cliche' high school story when it isn't at all. In high school stories it's usually about trying to fit in but Twilight doesn't really care about fitting in. It's essentially an empire vs rebellion story in just a high school setting. Sure, our villain tries to use some high school drama stuff against Twilight but it's such a small portion of the film that I can't believe focus on it that much. When sunset shimmer learns that her cyber bullying plan doesn't stop Twilight she's off to her next plan. Boom Done and yet people still complain about it. There are some flawed moments but there not so bad to give it a one star rating People tend to see a school setting with humanized versions of the characters they know and love and make a bad assumption or go in to this movie with some biases. And for the record when I see this movie I don't see Hasbro trying to rival say Monster High or Bratz because those are shallow characters who seem to just care about 1 thing only and that's their looks. But I never get that impression for Equestria Girls. Sure not everybody needed to be in a skirt (especially AJ I picture in jeans as for RD SKORT NOT A SKIRT seems fitting. To me it shows athleticism and femininity.) I see the characters that we all know and love in a new setting. Plus the Bratz and Monster High characters always try to look sexy and the only scene I can consider to be sexy is when RD is shaving her hips in front of the camera THAT'S IT and if anyone else thinks otherwise then you know what...I can't help it if you have a dirty mind.

The ""magic of friendship"" theme was obvious throughout, and, despite some cheeky comments and bad attitude from the movie's villain, is a very clean and family-friendly film.  We only do movies on Friday nights, so my kids don't really have much exposure to regular cartoons and such.  We've been careful to select shows and themes that promote positive attitudes and choices, and this movie doesn't disappoint.  Of course, I get a bit tired of hearing of the high-pitched voices of some of the characters, but that's probably just a ""Mom"" thing.  I suppose it's payback for all the Care Bears and Duck Tales I watched when I was a kid -- now I know what my mother meant when she said she could only take so much cartoon talk.  :)  Either way, if you have daughters that love MLP or if you're just looking for a clean, cute movie with a good lesson, this is a good choice!",1385510400,3,1089,4.4873096446700504

5734265,3,B00CPTUN5G,"As the father of a 7 year old daughter who loves My Little Pony, I decided to preview this film before she watched it because the whole ""Hey, let's turn My Little Pony into another Monster High/Winx clone"" concept gave me pause.  And I'm glad I did, because this movie was NOT written for little girls (have people forgotten who the MLP target audience was supposed to be?).  It's for bronies and pegasisters.

I very generously gave this movie three stars, and only because admittedly the tunes are catchy, and if you're an adult that happens to be into this show, you'll enjoy it.  I can't knock you: I was into Digimon in my early 20s.  But we've been trying very hard to teach our daughter the values and importance of being a strong woman in a society that still largely treats women as second class citizens; that she can do or be anything she wants, not restricted by what others think she should be.  Which is why we loved My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic.  This movie, on the other hand, just stresses the importance of being popular in high school (which is easily overlooked because of the ""have lots of friends too"" message).

To summarize (SPOILER ALERT): Twilight's crown gets stolen by another pony.  Twilight enters alternate dimension and goes to high school.  In the most convoluted plot point ever, Twilight enters popularity contest so she can win her crown back.  Twilight wins popularity contest by getting all the school factions together, teaches popular girl the importance of friendship by becoming the popular girl with the most friends.

I'm not even going to get into the begging-for-a-panty-flash miniskirted, anorexic character designs.  God forbid even Rainbow Dash or Applejack would wear something sensible for sports or farmwork like, oh, pants.  And am I the only one that noticed the only characters that didn't fit the tall and scrawny body type were Sunset Shimmer's henchmen?",1384041600,7,1918,4.861538461538461

HOWEVER - this movie was a wonderful surprise. As you would expect, it is more about friendship and the importance of all the characteristics that make up the elements of harmony. I think there is a great lesson about bullying that I even reference when talking to my own kiddos (7 and 5 yrs old). ""Do you want to be a bully like Sunset Shimmer?"" ""No, Mommy!""

I really love the way the Mane 6 friends are translated into young ladies. Great animation, great lessons, great songs. If you love MLP:FiM, you will love this!",1383782400,,785,4.268456375838926

5734367,4,B00CPTUN5G,"Call me one of the skeptics -- as something of a My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic fan, I had strong reservations regarding the upcoming ""Equestria Girls"" movie (though at first I misheard and thought it was going to be its own series, not simply a movie).  Humanized ponies?  That just sat wrong with me, given that I'd grown quite attached to the equine-run world of Equestria and its horse/Pegasus/unicorn inhabitants, and some leaked character designs only further turned me off.  It seemed as if Hasbro wanted to latch on to the same market occupied by Bratz and Monster High, and while I understand Hasbro has to make a buck somehow, the movie seemed like little more than a money-grab to me.  But I was determined to give it a chance before writing it off completely.

I saw the movie for the first time this weekend (my sister, a bigger Pony fan than I am, sat me down and made me watch), and I have to take back a lot of what I thought.  While I do still prefer the characters as ponies, ""Equestria Girls"" is a fun and cute spinoff, and well worth a look if you're an MLP:FIM fan.

WARNING:  This movie does contain some spoilers for the Season 3 finale of the show.  It's recommended that you finish watching the series up to the end of Season 3 before watching this movie.

The movie picks up almost immediately after Twilight Sparkle's coronation as a princess, and she's still very unsure about her royal duties and her newly acquired wings.  But when a mysterious intruder steals her crown -- which contains her Element of Harmony, thereby rendering the other Elements useless -- Princess Celestia shows her a gateway to another world where she can face down the thief, a former student of Celestia named Sunset Shimmer, and recover her crown.  Traveling to said other world turns poor Twilight into a teenage girl (and her dragon companion Spike into an adorable puppy), and she finds herself in a strange alternate reality where Canterlot is a high school, familiar faces from Ponyville have become students, faculty, and storekeepers in a human city, and the human versions of her best friends are bitter enemies who hold grudges against each other.  Even worse, Sunset Shimmer is clearly the queen bee of the school, using manipulation and blackmail to further her own ends.  Twilight will have to reunite the human versions of her friends, beat Sunset Shimmer at her own game, and re-obtain her crown... all on a time limit, for the portal to this world will close within days and leave her stranded in the human world if she doesn't hurry...

The plot is fairly clich, combining elements of an alternate-universe plot (including finding doubles of people from one's own world and operating on a time limit with the threat of being trapped in the alternate reality) and a traditional high-school flick (the school dance, the cliques and popularity fights, the underdog trying to overthrow the most popular student in school).  But it manages to mesh these two normally-overdone plots well, and that helps it stand out from standard fare.  The fact that said plot is carried by familiar faces and characters doesn't hurt either, especially given that one character in particular is still trying to figure out the basics of walking upright and using hands instead of hooves in addition to trying to complete her quest.  In fact, some of the funniest moments come from Twilight's missteps as she has to learn that running on all fours and eating without using your hands are generally seen as bizarre among humans.

The animation is as smooth and clean in the film as it is in the show, and despite taking place in our world it fits well with the colorful and inventive world of the show.  The Technicolor look to the humans can be a little off-putting at times, though -- it does help the viewer recognize a particular favorite pony in their human form, but it does make for some head-tiltingly strange moments -- wouldn't a purple-skinned human be a little strange in the human world?

Speaking of recognizing favorite ponies, however, part of the fun of this film was finding favorite ponies from the show amongst the human populace of this world.  Not only are the Mane Six present, but Princess Celestia serves as the principal of the high school (with Princess Luna as vice-principal -- I didn't see Princess Cadence, however).  Cheerilee, the Cutie Mark Crusaders, the Great and Powerful Trixie, Snips and Snails, Mrs. Cake, and Big Macintosh also get appearances and lines, and sharp-eyed viewers might also see minor characters such as Photo Finish, the DJ pony, Featherweight, Time Turner (aka Doctor Hooves), and Derpy Hooves (aka Ditzy Doo) in various scenes.  And the show also introduces a few new characters, such as Sunset Shimmer and Flash Century, who I hope make appearances in the show proper.

EDIT:  Forgot to mention -- the songs.  Just like in the show, the songs in this movie are quite catchy and fun.  My two nieces have many of the songs memorized and will sing along with the characters.  Hey Hasbro, release a MLP soundtrack already, will you?  I'll pay for it...

While I still prefer to see the ponies as... well, ponies, this show was a fun departure from the norm, and a lot more fun and well-done than I was expecting.  Any fan of the show should give this a watch before dismissing it out of hand.  Who knows?  You might just love it.  And if nothing else, it's fun looking for various favorite ponies in their human forms.",1380499200,,5477,4.729473684210526

5734386,4,B00CPTUN5G,"While this movie is enjoyable, it does have the hints of being aimed at a younger audience (I'm fourteen and I felt this way.)
The feeling that you get while watching that is of watching the Barbie movies, like The Nutcracker.

That being said, for a film of such a genre, it's really good. It has an antagonist of which we're not sure if she's redeemable or not, and having been ""The Star Pupil Of Princess Celestia"" it makes her a very interesting character. Of course her having Snips and Snails as her henchman is still brinking on ridiculous. (Hey, didn't Trixie already do that?)

I feel this movie really does prove Twilight as a girl who can overcome any obstacle, which I believe is a good lesson. With a little faith, anything is possible.
Also, I think it's great that they put in friendships that had to be patched! I related to it very much, and I believe that a lot of people do! Having friends is hard, but worth it!

Twilight's transition from pony to human had me worried, and at first I ""poo poo'd"" the movie.  But it is done beautifully.

One small disappointment, they added a slightly romantic aspect between the character Twilight Sparkle and a boy named Flash.  Since she is transported to a ""human"" world and is in high school, I guess they couldn't leave this kind of interaction out.  But it makes the movie geared a little more toward girls a little older (ie. 8-11 years), and at the end, the romantic aspect follows her to her pony world with a new pony named Flash.  It's left completely open ended, and I assume the next season will also contain this aspect.

5734406,5,B00CPTUN5G,"6 good ways to survive the wait for season 4 of my little pony friendship is magic

1. watch the show
if your the kind of brony who likes to watch my little pony over and over again, you can easily watch all 3 current seosons on netflix, or if you don't have netflix you can get a one month trial.
2. spend time with loved ones.
if you like other things too or if you have someone to play with ask them over to your house and spend quality time with them.
3. play games
 if your a gamer like me you can just sit down at your your pc or mac or any other game system and get wasted.
4. get some rest.
if you can't do any of those things just get some sleep, and dream about what you've seen in reason 1 watch the show.
5. Modify your system
if you have a lot of money and can pay for better performance, upgrade your system so that you'll get the best out of my little pony when season 4 is on air.
6. DO WHATEVER THE #&$# YOU WANT
personally i like to just waste my time on indie games like minecraft or Garry's mod, but if your a regular brony and just can't wait for season 4, just kill yourself, or kill the your time. and keep in mind that i don't hate killing time and i'll be giving my little pony friendship is magic season 4 a very big stare when it comes out later this year.

Just a word of caution:  the villain in this episode, Sunset Shimmer, is pretty frightening and gave my daughter nightmares.  She is newly six and had nightmares when she saw the Queen Chrysalis character featured in the the season two  2-part finale of ""A Canterlot Wedding"".  If your child is somewhat younger or more sensitive to characters like that, you might want to monitor the episodes closely with your child so you are available to minimize any fear this may raise.

5734451,4,B00CPTUN5G,"As a long time Brony i was doubtful hearing about this movie and setting. I will be honest when I say I thought it was going to be utterly terrible. And while I can't say it's 24 Carat gold, I will say that it far exceed my expectations.

Plot: Arguably the weakest part of the story in my opinion. While on a visit to the Crystal Empire, newly crowned Princess Twilight has her crown/Element of Harmony stolen by a strange mare and taken to another world. To retrieve it she must travel to this other reality and face the challenge that awaits...

High School.

This was where I thought the movie was going to crash and burn. I expected something about all the trials and troubles of high school and how with good friends you can get through them and stuff like that which I have seen a million times before. To be far while there is a hint of that, it's not the general 'thrust' of the story. The message seems to be more about finding ways to accept everyone and how everyone can pull together with a common goal in mind. This is rushed and along with the villains plot it all feels a bit too much shoved together with underdeveloped plot lines that do little or go nowhere. This is perhaps because the time limit Twilight has is just three days. If it were a full week (and the movie had been two hours or more) there would have been time to explore these plots more thoroughly.

Characters: With the exception of one new villain all the characters are really the same as those from the show, just taking on slightly different roles. In that sense it's enlightening to see how these individuals can be just as interesting as humans as they are being ponies. Pinkies antics in particular were quite amusing, as always.

Music: This was the biggest selling point for me after watching the movie. Some might call the music generic pop or rock, but I found most of it it quite enjoyable if a bit easy to forget with the exception of one or two songs. Still overall the soundtrack was great and I am personally hoping for a collection of music from this and and the show to be released soon.

Moral/Lesson: Like in the show there is a lesson to be learned from Twilights adventures. I don't want to spoil it for those that haven't seen it, but the general message seems to be that a leader is one who can inspire by standing /with/ those they care about. The writers have said the movie is canon at least in so far as that this was teaching Twilight how to be a leader. She had leadership qualities in the show, but she only had to manage five close friends. This was about inspiring individuals she knew almost nothing about and bringing them together with a common goal. Even if it doesn't seem all that strong it's a good message all the same I believe.

Final Analysis: The movie is far from perfect. Focusing on the plot too much gives the whole thing a faintly rushed and underdeveloped tone. On the other hand, if you can turn your brain off and not ask questions too much about the 'why' and 'how' of things that are happening it still can be quite the enjoyable experience.",1378512000,,3081,4.385288966725044

The team behind this film really put some thought on how that they wanted to make the human versions of the ponies unique while keeping true to who they are.  The musical numbers are great, especially the cafeteria musical number.  This is not your traditional pony movie...

5734474,2,B00CPTUN5G,"I've been a brony since sometime early 2011 and one of the biggest 'concepts' that I recall seeing in the fandom around that time and then on was the idea of a mishmash of both ponies and humans.  A novel idea and what can be assumed as the bane of this movie.  Does it live up to it?  Yes and no.  If one is wanting to look at how well it ties into canon it does so exceptionally well (having Scootaloo doing a chicken dance, Celestia being all ruling but not all knowing, etc.) but the other area I focused on was how well it fared if one didn't watch the series but expected it to make sense.

The Good:
-Very close if not perfect to the characters back in Equestria.
-Gives a good alternative universe to parallel Equestria that has no major flaws.
-The plot itself makes sense if one is well versed in Equestrian lore (i.e. seen all three seasons).
-Tons of background characters placed in their respective roles.

The Bad:
-The designs are too bland and too similar.  All the female characters wearing skirts for example (Rainbow Dash's tomboyish nature would differ here)
-The plot itself has a few gaping holes in it.
-Characters introduced are not necessarily going to be canon in the show such as Flash Sentry.  I would interpret this being the movie being so 'bad' or my less cynical approach that with different production schedules that it was never a consideration to add Flash into Season 4 of the TV series.
-Is a rehash of the pilot episode (meet new friends, the villain attempts to break them, harmony powers and immediate reversion of the villain to neutral).
-It's said that the main six characters are of the age and/or mentality of young adults whereas here they are teenagers.
-For those that are more or less aware of the show will understand the references better than those who don't watch the series.
-A big screen release in Macromedia/Adobe Flash does kinda come across as something rare, I think?

The Plot (I've only seen it once so I might be out of order):

From what I recall the movie starts out with Twilight and her friends residing in the Crystal Empire right after the season 3 finale featured in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/My-Little-Pony-Friendship-is-Magic-Princess-Twilight-Sparkle/dp/B00AZP0BN6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">My Little Pony, Friendship is Magic: Princess Twilight Sparkle</a>&nbsp;and some point before Twilight ascertains her duties as a princess.  This part is well done and captures the beauty and glamor of the Crystal Empire (I never saw this on the big screen but nonetheless).  Along the way at night Sunset Shimmer, a former student of Celestia, emerges into Equestria and successfully steals Twilight's magical crown.

Now to break off from the movie plot there are two things that I can see that makes it seem odd.  For the most part while this show is written for little girls things like the space-time continuum and how long a pony lives aren't going to be explained...OR if Celestia at some point or another has multiple students under her wing.  Throwing in characters mid-end season is a bit risky however it did work exceptionally well with Shining Armor and Mi Amore Cadenza.  As for Sunset Shimmer it mildly works but feels different since it breaks some of what the show established.  However I'm just gonna stick with the Gameloft game's implication that any student enrolled in Celestia's School for Gifted Unicorns is that of being Celestia's student.

Twilight is instructed by Celestia to go into the portal and recover her crown.  She does so and her dragon assistant Spike follows her into the portal and into the humanoid world.  I've seen enough fan written work that portals tend to be cliche and overused.  I also understand that finding an interdimensional way from point A to point A minus 1 that it is not as easy as it seems.  The exit point of the portal goes right in front of Canterlot High School.  Quick and easy access but I'm surprised a texting student hasn't successfully walked into it yet.

Along the way Fluttershy turns in the crown and Celestia puts it in place for the upcoming dance.  I've honestly never watched too much TV so I can't say I've seen a lot of high school TV shows.  All I can state is that it does seem a little too common but I can give it the benefit of the doubt.  Along the way Twilight meets her friends similarly to the original episode (Spike's affection to Rarity is also present) and is cyberbullied by Snips and Snails using modern day technology such as smartphones and 'YouTube' (while written language is obscured because of regions the design is reminiscent of it).  If someone was a horse in a human's body (i.e. American Dad when Stan switches bodies with a horse) we'd all expect them to act like horses and the plot works well with that.  Even though I've had my share of bad bronies and bullying within the fandom I didn't think twice of what is shown here.  I understand though that the issue of cyberbullying is in fact a rather grave one and that makes me wonder how iffy for some that can be as a learning tool vs. 'having it happen to them' I guess.

So far up to this point the plot is good but it is then on that it begins to just roll down hill.

In order for Twilight to win the crown she has to participate in dance and be elected princess.  As a suspense the dance occurs within hours before the portal closes for 30 moons.  The time of measure isn't really specified but Sunset Shimmer has won the last three times this event has occurred.  Where things get a a bit more iffy is that Twilight asks who can participate and Celestia says 'anyone'.  To me implies that Twilight is not even a student at Canterlot High which could explain why she does not go to any classes.  Personally while classroom scenes are overdone it's not complicated to at least put in a scene that she goes into a classroom and then after a while leaves it, etc.

Where the non-canon (in terms of the actual TV show) love interest comes into play is that of Flash Sentry.  A former ex of Sunset Shimmer and one who helps Twilight clear her name of sabotaging the gymnasium where the dance is being held.  It was just kinda thrown in there because Hollywood and all and his role really wasn't that big.  So with a song, something not really memorable (whereas I remember four of the seven songs in Magical Mystery Cure), the student body rebuilds the decorations and they proceed to have the dance.  Pretty much Twilight wins and Sunset Shimmer steals the crown.  I can honestly understand Twilight's necessity of doing things 'properly' but to me it also felt like the whole school plot is meaningless if Sunset Shimmer was just gonna steal it.

Sunset Shimmer turns into a demon, mind controls the student body and goes on a rampage just to be defeated by the crown itself with Twilight absorbing its power.  Twilight's magic also gives her friends pony ears, tails and wings (if applicable).  Kinda awkward I suppose if one has been on the Internet long enough.  Twilight returns home and the movie ends with Sunset Shimmer remaining in the other world instantly reformed and apologetic (which happened the only time the Elements of Harmony were used and the target of that was still conscious) and in good hands.

Conclusion: 2/5

The reason why I'm rating it 2/5 is as follows:
-There could of been something else done besides a high school.  Heck there could be no school and merely a neighborhood and a similar plot (except the dance) could of worked.
-The character designs are not really that good and don't match some of the characters such as Rainbow Dash.
-Just felt like too much too close to the pilot episodes.  Which were great episodes but as I've come to expect the pilot episodes are always stepping in the waters unsure of what to expect.  In other words it shouldn't be remade into a movie.
-The movie really didn't catch the spirit of the television show at all.  While it matches the characters very well the feel just wasn't there.
-The plot just wasn't that good.  Rebooting the series into it, forcing Twilight to meet all her friends again felt like a waste of time.
-I mostly don't understand the hype behind it or why so many bronies loved it.  Call me weird (can you do that...can you be weird to the second degree?) but it does make me wonder 'if it's Generation 4 do we all love it and if it's not will we all hate it?'
-Focused too much on shoutouts.
-I'll admit I went in with an open mind and like the above didn't catch the appeal.

I might watch it again for a second opinion but I don't know.  If I do I might update this review.  I might also update it because I'm pretty sure I've left some gaping holes in my logic as well.",1377648000,6,8740,4.63465282284231

She can tell you the names of even the tertiary characters what they do what their cutie mark is, etc... so needless to say I get a lot of exposure to this particular franchise. I sit and watch it with her and think the show is cute and certainly makes me chuckle. But the way her face lights up when her ponies are on is what I truly love.

Anyways, onto the movie. She loved it and we've watched it several times since it arrived. She loves that they turn into humans and she loves the songs and sings along and dances with them. As her dad the movie is cute. Even I, after being subjected to the series episodes so many times noticed little similarities and references to the series.

By that standard I give it a five. I'm rating it for her because I know that's what she'd give it and I'm sure your MLP fan will, too.",1377388800,,989,4.092783505154639
5734478,5,B00CPTUN5G,"I am a Brony of sorts, and I give this movie five stars.
When one of my little buddies found out that I had ordered the BluRay version of MLP-EG, she decided to
have a slumber party where she and all of her little friends could spend an evening watching it.
Then she asked me if they could watch my copy, depending on the Power of Cuteness to get her way, as
little girls so often do.
Her parents wisely decided that they had plans for that night, and that it was my duty to babysit, as it was,
after all, my copy of the movie that started the whole thing rolling. Or snowballing, as it turned out.
So I found myself playing sheepdog for the night to an avalanche of adorability. Watching Equestria Girls
over and over. With repeats of the most popular scenes, like the Cafeteria rally.
Y'know, I liked it. The little girls, who comprised it's target audience, loved it. Five stars, indeed.

Now, let me address some of the critics here on Amazon:
#1, this movie was not meant to represent any particular type of schoolkid. I doubt if there were very many
fat girls who walked away from this movie feeling sad because no character looked like them. If there were,
then they have way more problems that any movie can counter.
In fact, I doubt if there were any black-haired, chocolate skinned darlings who walked away sad for the
same reason. Or any lighter-shinned or Asian girls, either. Face it, under those circumstances, the only
girls who would be satisfied would be the punks, goths, emos and other alts. Because most of the
characters in this movie, even the adults, looked like nobody in real life. Because, y'know, purple skin?
Green hair?
Don't get me started on body image. OH MY GOD! This movie is telling little girls that their ideal body would
have their feet amputated to fit them into stubby tube boots! Waaahhhh! Evil!
Get real, folks. It's a movie, not a life-changing event.

#2, this movie was produced for little girls, not Bronies. So the whole ponies-as-humans line of whining is
pretty much a wash. The target audience loves it, and that's all that matters.
In fact, why are the Bronies complaining so vociferously about the writers doing something THAT BRONIES
THEMSELVES DO SO MUCH OF? Just do a search for ""Pony Porn"" sometime... Rather, don't. What you will
see can never be unseen. Just don't.

#3, the movie was a little preachy in spots. Yeah, a movie that shows different groups of kids like rockers,
artists, jocks and ecos cooperating to accomplish good goals is a bad thing right? The target audience
seemed to like it, so get stuffed.

In the end, I will give this movie five stars. It was well written, with a good story and message, the artistic
style was faithful to the MLP series, and the characters' personalities and behaviors were faithful to their
MLP prototypes. I especially liked all of the background characters that you could recognize as
background characters from the MLP series, like Photo Finish and others. They even had their cutie marks
worked into the decorations on their clothing, which was a nice touch.

But the major reason for my giving it five stars has little to do with the fact that I enjoyed watching it.
The major reason is that the little girls I know enjoyed watching it. And in the end, that's what matters.
Priorities, people!",1377388800,,3301,4.626279863481229
5734479,4,B00CPTUN5G,"I wasn't sure what to think when I first heard about Equestria Girls, and was very hesitant about the whole thing, but I went to see EG at the theater, and I ended up really enjoying it! =) It's very cute to see Twilight try to figure out being a human. And the movie has some very funny and cute parts in it, as well! And it has lots of references to the show (My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic). By the way, to fully enjoy Equestria Girls, you must at least have seen a few episodes of My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic (if not all of them). Some aspects of the plot would be hard to figure out for someone who hasn't seen the show, and doesn't know what the Elements of Harmony are, among other things. I'd recommend this movie for people who are already fans of the show, and if you want to watch this without first seeing the show, I really recommend reading up on the show.

*spoilers start here* My only real problem with this movie was that some aspects of the plot seemed far-fetched to me, such as Sunset Shimmer's transformation (which was creepy and sudden), and the counterparts of Twilight's friends readily and easily accepting the fact that Twilight was really a pony princess and not a human. Also, I do wonder why Twilight got a crush on a boy in this movie, only for him to be confirmed to not appear in Season 4. Why get a crush to only never see him again? (Though, I thought her crush was cute, and her boyfriend seemed really nice) *spoilers end here* The plot did seem a little bit harder to believe than plots in Friendship is Magic, but I think that the writer, Meghan McCarthy, still did a very good job with the plot (considering the big changes that came in when Twilight went to the human world), and carried Twilight and her friends over extremely well to the human world (with the exception of Snips, Snails, and Miss Cheerliee, whose personalities seemed different from the show.)

LONG STORY SHORT- This movie is very enjoyable, and carries over the spirit and friendship of the show very well! =) (Just to let you know, a certain scene may scare sensitive kids, so if your kid is very sensitive, I'd prewatch the movie for them to determine if it would bother them.) I overall recommend this movie for Friendship is Magic fans! =)

Also, I wasn't sure what to rate it out of five, so I rated it 4. On the scale of 1-10 I'd give it 7 or 8/10. :)",1377302400,,2383,4.32662192393736

Anyway, given the fact that they're reaching hard to bring in a wider audience, this is still a cute fantasy cartoon-movie.

The plot is pretty basic but unfortunately predictable as our newly-crowned Princess, Twilight Sparkle [*spoilers if you haven't finished Season 3!*], journeys into the strange new world of Canterlot High to get back her crown from a thief named Sunset Shimmer before bad things happen in Equestria, but luckily, Twilight meets humans that look very much like her friends back at home... and guess what? Friendship is still Magic, regardless of the predictably of the film.

The animation is really good and fluid like in the show, and the human character designs work out for most of the time [especially with the Mane Six and Sunset Shimmer; they're seen as both humans and ponies at least once]. The main characters [this counts for known background characters too] stay true to their character, in my opinion, and the human versions really are decent High School mirrors of their Ponyville selves. I especially think just watching Twilight adjust in this new place and then use her special skills to survive is really amazing compared to her from the first episode of the series - watch the entirety of Friendship is Magic so far and you'll notice how much she's changed, and it shows here in this movie. Props to the writers for keeping this consistent!

Hard-core bronies will definitely enjoy trying to spot consistencies with some dialogue and scene similarities, human designs of certain ponies, and the end credits with things they know and love from the show. Also, the bonus features focused on the making of the movie aren't bad... though they could have been meatier, given the fact that a lot of adult fans of the show will probably buy this DVD. Kids will love the bright colors and the really good songs [thankfully there's a karaoke sing-along bonus on the DVD!], as well as the continuing adventure of our favorite characters... in the form of human teenagers that kids can relate to. It also teaches a decent message about friendship that every kid should know, and they make the journey to learn said message very entertaining. Parents shouldn't have anything to fear with the colorful, sparkly content, though a couple of parts near the end might be frightening for some younger kids.

The only real flaws I have are that the movie could have tried harder to surprise viewers with parts of the obviously rushed plot. I did get a bit of a surprise near the climatic ending, but it went back to Planet Predictability about a minute later. Also, some of the major grown-up characters in Equestria got some really awful human designs [I'm mainly looking at you, Celestia and Luna], but it's not that big of a nitpick. Also, plot is rushed... very, very rushed, but it's for the running time, I'm sure.

But in the end, did I enjoy it? Yes. Definitely yes. It felt like an Alternate-Universe episode of Friendship is Magic, and I think that's what Equestria Girls is meant to be - just that. At least there's something decently good for MLP fans to watch until the premiere of Season 4 later this year! If you're a fan or if you live with little pony fans, I highly suggest you pick up a copy of this DVD and don't mind if a song or two gets stuck in your head afterwards!",1376697600,,3552,4.685897435897436

5734493,2,B00CPTUN5G,"Well, I'll give Hasbro credit for at least trying something different. but lets face it, this was, in baseball terms, a swing and a miss.
The look of the film is ok (Anorexia is Magic nowwithstanding), the music does sound good. But that's about all the good stuff it had going for it.
The story is too easy to follow (You can guess whats going to happen and be right 99% of the time.), most of the jokes are stuff you heard before, and some elements can get left out of this and you wouldn't miss them.
I guess if you Must have everything with MLP:FIM attached to it, go get it. For everyone else, rent it first and see if its your thing.

5734495,3,B00CPTUN5G,"I was skeptical about this movie.  I went into it knowing what it was: Hasbro attempting to use the popularity of what is possibly its most popular brand to make a line of dolls to compete with other toy companies.  That, and the somewhat scary character designs (like on the cover), made me skeptical, but I was also intrigued by the movie trailers on YouTube and positive reviews fellow fans have given, so I had to give it a shot.  So I found it on YouTube and watched it.

First, the negatives:
The romantic subplot, while not entirely pointless, went nowhere, and the movie could just have easily done without it.
The ending was a little outlandish in relation to the events that led up to it, and it also felt rushed.
The movie wasn't paced very well.

Now, the positives:
The character designs are much better than the cover led me to believe.
The music is done very well, and is sometimes as memorable as that on the show.
The characters, while human, are still exactly the same as on the show when you get right down to it.
The overall message of friendship is never lost, even with the outlandish ending, and I was genuinely moved when the message came full-circle at the end.

With the knowledge of why this movie was made to begin with, and the fact that it was primarily a movie for the fans, I give it a 7/10.  Overall, it was enjoyable, and I believe it stays true to the theme conveyed by the show, of which I am a huge fan (I am a brony). However, it may or may not hit with your personal tastes.  My advice would be: if you are a fan of the show and have the chance to watch this movie, do so, and if you like it, support the makers of the movie by buying it.  I made sure to watch it on YouTube first, and I enjoyed it, so I pre-ordered the movie (I just got it today).

5734500,4,B00CPTUN5G,"I have to say, I was never a big fan of the concept that this movie was based on, but the final product is better than the premise would have you believe.  It's hardly perfect, but it's more than worth watching and has some great moments.

The good:
- The humor is great; pretty much all the scenes of Twilight trying to adjust to life in the human world are hilarious, and all of the character humor that the original show is so good at is there in full force.
- All of the existing characters are carried over into the movie very well; they definitely still feel like themselves
- The attention to detail: there's always something interesting going on in the background; most of the famous background ponies show up, and it goes to show that the writers were actively trying to make a quality product.

The average:
- The songs are catchy, but I don't think they're as good as the ones from the show itself.
- The plot is interesting in theory, but not all the potential gets used and most of the story is a fairly banal high school drama type thing (until the end, which is epic).
- The animation is definitely good, but the character designs are a bit off (the characters are all too skinny and the heads are too big in proportion to their bodies) and it knocks things down a bit.

The not-so-good:
- The movie's new characters are a bit lackluster.  Sunset Shimmer has an interesting backstory (Celestia's previous apprentice who fails and ran away to another world), but that largely gets passed over in favor of treating her as just a typical popular girl who's a jerk.  Flash Sentry has even less going for him; he's just sort of a generic ""cute guy"" character who contributes so little to the plot that he might as well not be there.

Overall, the main plot is a bit shaky and typical at places, but the cast is strong enough to make it perfectly watchable.  Not quite the MLP movie I was hoping for, but it's still a very fun watch.",1376352000,,1942,4.375
5734501,5,B00CPTUN5G,"When I first heard about this movie and saw the trailer I wasn't sure what to expect or even if I would like it. I haven't had the movie but a few days and I have already watched it several times. It picks up not long after the end of season three ... in fact the first five minutes of the movie could have been a tag ending to the last episode of season three. Taking Twilight to the human world was necessary for this story to work. This is her journey of coming into her own as a Princess and becoming comfortable with her new self. All of the ""mane"" six personalities are there and nothing skips a beat while in the alternate human world. I really did not get the sense that this is just to sell or expand the toy line. I imagine that they will, it would be bad business not to. But, this movie doesn't come across as just a commercial for new products. The story told has a purpose and fits right in and flows from and back into the MLP:FIM world we are familiar with in a very natural, smooth way. The songs are good, the humor is classic cartoon slapstick with a touch of sarcasm placed sparingly here and there ... pretty much about the same as the show itself. There are a lot of nods to jokes and little things from the series here and there to look for as well as human versions of many of the background ponies that are fun to spot. The extras are also decent. The interviews with the creative staff were the best part of the extras for me. They shed light on how they came to this point and where they plan to go, the state of the series, the wide range of demographics the series reaches and that sort of stuff. There are also behind the scenes on the art design and music that are an interesting watch. Overall this is a good blu-ray/dvd set. The picture looks fine and sound comes through clean and crisp. If you are a fan of the show this is a good addition to your MLP collection. I was pleasantly surprised ... good job MLP staff!!",1376265600,2,1950,4.147757255936676

I agree it was more for merchandising than anything else, but Hasbro owns MLP so that kinda expected.

5734506,5,B00CPTUN5G,"The ""My Little Pony Friendship is Magic"" team did it again. Never am I disappointed by the work they put into their series. No matter what form they take, the ponies are easily identifiable not just by their appearance but by the wholeness of their character. The magic of friendship is as powerful here in our world as it is in their world. The only way evil can control and dictate the masses is if they are divided by barriers of taste and there is no unity. But when united by friendship and they see they have more in common in terms of principle and humanity, no one is stronger.

The antagonist is awesome; one of my favorites so far. She is just what you would expect from the high school mean girl stereotype and I think younger audience can really appreciate her character. Her final form is the scariest thing I've seen in My Little Pony and I hope we see more like her in the future.

However, the extra features were, decent. There was a short behind the scenes look at it, a few bits of information were interesting, I always enjoyed seeing how the movie I watched was made. The Ponify Yourself was very odd, its just a few girls putting on makeup similar to the makeup on the hideous vectors seen on merchandise, not the vectors seen in the actual movie, the vectors that made us think this movie was going to be awful. This entire sequence was strange and out of place, I expected a pony OC creator or a human creator that would allow you to make versions of yourself in the same animation style as the movie, but oh well. The karaoke songs were fun, seeing how I loved both of the songs that were used. The printable poster was a bit of a letdown, I expected something unique with all of the characters on it or something, but all I got was the movie poster used at theaters. You know I could've just printed out that exact image from Google, right Hasbro?

But overall, I am a satisfied buyer and want the writer of the film, Meghan McCarthy, to sign it so badly the next time I can see her at a convention!",1376006400,,1283,4.38655462184874
5734509,3,B00CPTUN5G,"My Little Pony: Equestria Girls is the first feature length movie based off of the Fourth Generation of My Little Pony. It's directed by Jayson Thiessen and written by Meghan McCarthy, stars Tara Strong, Ashleigh Ball, Andrea Libman, Tabitha St. Germaine, and more voice actors. It had its fun moments and got a couple laughs out of me but ultimately it failed to capture why this series is so endearing to its fans in the first place.

THE BLU-RAY:

Crisp sound and visual quality. The songs, while forgettable mostly, sounded great with surround sound.

There's some visual problems but they are probably technical errors with the film itself. Fortunately, there's less model errors here than in the show.

This is also Hasbro's first real attempt to make quality special features for the My Little Pony Brand. The Karaoke songs and Ponify-Yourself are fun features for kids, I guess. The real reason why I purchased this movie was for the Behind the Scenes material, actually. It was nice to hear the opinions from an actor, the writer, the animators, and Hasbro executives from this movie.

The Blu-Ray release is a good step in the right direction for future My Little Pony releases.

THE MOVIE:

For the most part, the movie was decently written. There were some funny fish-out-of-water written scenes, the first half had me enticed with what was going on and what was on stakes, and the world Twilight travels to was interesting.

There's tons of visual references and returning cameos for the older fans. While some were subtle and funny, it did feel like there were a bit too much background characters from the show now in the movie. Trixie's cameo was fun and it would have been nice if she played a bigger more meaningful role.

The songs, usually a strength of the series, unfortunately weren't really memorable in this outing. Most of them are really forgettable and I have never really been a fan of pop music. Having seen the movie twice now, only the 'Help Twilight Win the Crown' comes off as memorable and catchy.

The villain of the film comes off as disappointing towards the end. At first, she seems like a real threat to Twilight and her friends. Diabolical, scheming, and a villain that would get under Twilight's skin (which in the series, doesn't often happen since most villains have no personal grudges or are equal to Twilight). Unfortunately, she becomes a monologue-heavy heavy villain at the end, hatches some implausible plan to take over the world with an army of teenagers, lets the girls power up to defeat her, and instantly 'redeems' herself, giving a lazy excuse for why she did everything. Her two henchmen, Snips and Snails literally became the Bulk and Skull of the movie for no reason other than the two being famous for being (unwilling) servants of Trixie in the show. It would have been nice if they weren't recycled characters and instead, new characters like Sunset Shimmer.

Twilight and Spike are the stars of this movie. Pinkie Pie and Fluttershy are great too though the same can't be said for Applejack, Rarity, and Rainbow Dash. Those three felt underplayed and that is where the movie really fell apart for me. At the end, we're supposed to accept that Twilight became friends with these human characters. But the movie never really make this concept plausible and we don't get enough time to have these three properly introduce themselves or do much in the film. It's where I honestly think this movie missed the mark the whole series's really about. The point of the movie outside to sell the EqG toylines, according to McCarthy and the other staff was to show how friendship could go beyond the pony world of Equestria. I don't think McCarthy and the others succeeded in that, which is a shame for the first movie from this series.

OVERALL:

My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic has never really been about the songs, the villains, the world, or the overarching epic stories. It was about the friendship these six and more characters formed over the course of the series. The first two parter of the series even managed to convey the whole message within 44 minutes as opposed to the 66 minutes this film had. It left me believing why Twilight would approach these five with open arms at the end.

Equestria Girls is a decent film that has some fun and funny moments. But as an older fan of the series, this movie fails to hit the mark that makes Friendship is Magic so appealing to so many older fans. In the grand scheme of things, Equestria Girls would actually fall into one of the worst episodes list, which is still decent and better than the usual cartoon movies targeted at this younger demographic (such as the Barbie movies from Mattel Entertainment). Hopefully we might see another movie or special next time that will focus on the pony characters in Equestria and stick true to the magic of friendship the show has.",1376006400,5,4885,4.75886524822695

I've had numerous songs from the movie stuck in my head for weeks. I've been waiting for this blu-ray longer than anything this year.

With all this said, there is a strange audio difference between the blu-ray and the digital copy. The digital copy's audio sounds like the movie is being played through a window, it sounds distant.

This will be moderately interesting to adult fans and older children who understand that this is a cartoon that human adults create. There are also 2 karaoke songs...which are pretty fun. My daughter loves the music in this show. The ""Ponify Yourself"" feature just left me scratching my head! It is kind of like a music video I guess. It is set to one of the songs in the movie and it switches back and forth between scenes from the cartoon and different human girls sitting in front of a mirror with ""pony"" makeup on. A girl will have colorful eyeshadow on and some clip-on hair extensions. And kind of look at herself and then wave. And then it will cut back to a movie scene. And that is it. ??? ok, whatever! And then it seems that there is a printable poster that you insert the blu-ray into a computer to access. So, not really impressed with all of that. But not completely disappointed either.

I chose the higher res WMV, and was sorely disappointed. The file is encrypted with some kind of DRM which means it will only play in Windows Media Player (not VLC, forget about it on Linux). I saw noticeable intermittent quality issues during playback which were obvious defects in the file. You would be much better off making your own 1080p rip of the Blu-Ray if you want a digital copy.

--Me, the first time I heard about a movie showing the ponies as human.

How wrong I was! Equestria Girls, in spite of turning our favorite ponies into humans, keeps all the humor, all the charm and all the fun of the regular FiM series.

Of course, this was originally made to run in select theatres, so you already know the production values are through the roof compared to the series. The animation is beautiful. They get so many different angles on the characters that the normal series wouldn't even attempt. The musical numbers are spot on (this from someone who usually can't stand musical numbers). Everything has that layer of polish that just makes it heads and shoulders above the normal series! And it's not like the normal series is too shabby either!

I can understand why someone would have reservations about a My Little Pony movie that isn't primarily about ponies. But they are the same characters, just in a new setting. Give it half a chance. If you love FiM, I'd be willing to bet that you'll love this movie too.",1375747200,7,1115,4.678571428571429

It's funny the things that kids notice because as soon as the music started for MLP, Reed said ""what IS this song?"" The upbeat fun version of the title song got a facelift and is a great way to show that this movie is different than the regular show. It sets the tone for the movie.

This movie is a classic tale of good versus evil when Princess Shimmer steals from Princess Twilight. (Who ever heard of a villain being named Princess Shimmer?) When they are turned into humans and attend the same school, they face additional challenges. My kids really got a kick out of seeing their ponies as humans. They were easily identifiable with their trademark colored hair and outfits.

The ponies were a bit sassy and sarcastic which I don't really like as a mom. I don't think one character or movie will heavily influence my kids but you never know where they are going to pick up certain phrases or attitudes. They are at the age that they repeat everything to try it out for themselves and gauge my reaction. I also think maybe it was a little old for my four and five year olds as they haven't yet had any of these experiences in school yet and can't really relate.

Nonetheless they enjoyed the movie and Paige especially was laughing a lot and understood the humor. While I also enjoyed the movie, as an adult I can discern better than my children what is appropriate so I think I'll put away My Little Pony Equestria Girls for a couple of years until they are older.",1375747200,2,1703,4.3125

Somehow what is honestly the dumbest premise imaginable for a pony movie managed to still be quite an enjoyable flick. I mean, I'm pretty sure aspects of the plot were the victims of studio mandates, but the writers were clearly aware of this, and proceeded to mock and entertain despite all of it.

Yes. It looks stupid. It looks intensely, mind-numbingly stupid. And yet somehow, by the end of it all, it's...still stupid. But that's okay and you're totally happy.",1375315200,,476,4.864197530864198
5734522,5,B00CPTUN5G,"After finding out about the humanizing of the characters (and seeing the god-awful prototype images) I was a skeptic about it at best. Like the Twilicorn issue, I avoided most conversations on it to avoid constant hate. This was the company that made MLP enjoyable in the first place, so they can definitely turn crap to gold.

The film came, I saw, I enjoyed. I thoroughly enjoyed. The writing was as good as the show and the animation is still great. The human designs were not that bad. When the only criticism I could think of is ""Why is Dash in a skirt and not shorts?"" then the designs are doing something right. There will always be arguments about the ""skinniness"" of the girls affecting how children should view themselves. But they are modeled after ponies, and I don't see any girls walking on all fours snacking on daisies...

The songs were...just okay really. Outside the VERY catchy ""Equestria Girls"" (aka. Helping Twilight Win the Crown) they were mostly there to provide a montage for things that needed to happen in the story, but would just stretch it out.

There were some nice shout outs to the Brony fandom as well, from popular side characters getting a few lines to characters acting in regard to the fanon (Scoot's chicken dance was just hilarious). I also loved playing Guess Who with the background characters.

The negative things I have to say are rather nitpicks than anything (timeframes, ease of Sunset's control, etc.) so I don't think they belong in a review.

All in all, if you're a MLP fan, give it a watch. If you're not, it's still not a bad watch.",1375315200,5,1587,4.633451957295374

They might as well become Eskimos if moms are hating on this! But I LOVED the movie, and the school setting with ""mean girls"" and ""the popular crowd"" is VERY REALISTIC, but on a very low scale. I would recommend this to little girls, in fact all ages!

In watching this I have to say that the creators did a great job combining two worlds and creating something magical for the viewer. My daughters loved the characters and caught on immediately that there were some connections between the friends that Twilight Sparkle had in the Crystal Empire and the alternate world, but the movie keeps you guessing somewhat on what will happen in the end. The plot was fun and engaging and you get easily drawn in and lose track of time when watching. Overall, this was a great movie for the whole family!

*I received a copy for review - all opinions are my own*",1374710400,,762,4.442857142857143
5734528,5,B00CPTUN5G,"When the first screenshots for ""Equestria Girls"" surfaced, let's just say ""love and tolerance"" weren't the first words that came to mind. No, instead, I reacted like a good portion of the fanbase: angry, upset, and honestly, like I had been deeply betrayed. It appeared that Hasbro had finally forsaken the audience that made ""Friendship is Magic"" such a big deal in the first place, and that they were solely pandering to the intended demographic. But upon actually watching it, my tune has changed. ""My Little Pony: Equestria Girls"" reminds me why I fell in love with this series in the first place, and why I'm still proud to call myself a part of this excellent fandom.

The story kicks off with protagonist, Twilight Sparkle, getting used to her new princesshood after the events of Season Three. She doesn't have much time to adjust, however, as an old student of Princess Celestia's steals Twilight's magical crown in the middle of the night, and bolts off to an alternate dimension. Tasked with regaining it, and with all of Equestria at stake, our heroine dashes into this strange new world of... humans?!

That's right, as you might have guessed by the promotional materials, Equestria Girls is a seemingly cynical attempt to sell humanoid dolls to children. Twilight finds herself in a high school, complete with human replicas of her friends, and must become Canterlot High School's equivalent of the prom queen to get back her crown. Unfortunately her rival has some nasty tricks up her sleeve, such as spreading gossip and framing Twilight for acts of vandalism. All this, and the fledgling princess has to deal with her first crush. Oh, what's a girl to do?

Yes, it all sounds very silly and childish, and that's really because it is. This is more blatantly pitched to little kids than the series has been recently, and because of that, it's almost like a breath of fresh air. There's a certain vibe of innocence to it that can't really be explained, yet somehow managed to make me smile the entire time. Through cheesy ""girls' night makeover"" montages and through positively adorable music numbers, I could not stop grinning and laughing like I was ten years old again. It takes a lot for something to make me drop my naturally cynical streak, but ""Equestria Girls"" managed to disarm and charm me in one fell, joyous swoop.

Not to say there isn't stuff for fans here as well. Longtime viewers will likely laugh with glee (I know I did) as fan-favorite background ponies get humanized, with charming results. Especially great is the focus on characters whom the community has embraced over time, such as ""The Great and Powerful"" Trixie Lulamoon (whose cameo had me in stitches) and DJ Pon-3/Vinyl Scratch. And yes, before you ask, a certain lazy-eyed pony makes an appearance, but you might have to wait a little while to see her...

With colorful, vibrant animation, and an infectious musical score, this movie exceeded all of my expectations. This is something that I feel any child would adore, and that any parent would get a kick out of watching with them. Not only that, but it carries on the series' fan-pleasing tradition, and evoking memories of those late 90's Cartoon Network shows we all loved so much. Everything about this movie made me happy, and I watched in thrall until the end of its disappointingly short runtime.

""My Little Pony: Equestria Girls"" is more than I ever expected it to be, and quite frankly, more fun and zesty than a good portion of Season 3. With the ending acting both as a potential lead-in to a spin-off AND to a stellar fourth season, this is one movie that kids, parents and fans alike should not miss out on. It's definitely worth adding to your collection.

Now... can we get that Season 4 premiere date, please?

Overall: A-",1374710400,3,3786,4.787136294027565
5734529,5,B00CPTUN5G,"However...my two daughters really enjoyed My Little Pony Equestria Girls.  The story teaches about the power of friendship as Twilight Sparkle ventures out to a new world and tries to reclaim her crown that was stolen from her in the Crystal Empire.  The humor is good as Twilight Sparkle tries to adjust to becoming a human and fitting into a new school with human like versions of her pony friends.  There's plenty of singing and dancing with catchy pop music and the voice acting is well done. The artwork is similar to the cartoon series which I'm sure my daughters will now want to see more of.  If you have girls, they'll love this movie.",1374451200,2,644,4.573913043478261
5734530,4,B00CPTUN5G,"We went to see this movie with my 7 year old daughter, who is a total fanatic about MLP FIM.  My husband and I are genuine bronies as well (oh, sorry, I guess I'm a ""pegasister""), and we thoroughly enjoyed this movie.  The storyline was great, the speed of introducing the characters was perfect, and the villain was a true meanie.  I thought the ending was a bit rushed and quite frankly a little scary for little ones (under age 5), but overall, we are definitely going to buy this when it comes out on DVD.

I loved the multiple hidden easter eggs throughout the movie, as well as a ""human"" version of every single pony in the franchise series.  There were some funny scenes and catchy one-liners in the movie as well, and the character of each of the ""human"" girls stayed true to their pony characters.",1374364800,2,806,4.418918918918919

But this film won me over. The personalities of Twilight and Spike were spot on, as were the other characters. Viewed as a side-episode of MLP:FIM, this is pretty good.

If I had a complaint about the film, it's that body-types other than tall-and-skinny weren't represented much. I would have liked to see Truffle Shuffle (dark, probably Hispanic and, President, I'm sure, of the Chess Club) in the hallways. And Scootaloo as a ""differently-abled"" child (which, I think, fits with Lauren Faust's vision of her) would have been refreshing. (I love Scoots and would dearly love to see her fly; but, maybe, that's not her destiny.)

This feature has a good heart and I am glad to embrace it.",1374278400,5,949,4.636904761904762
5734532,4,B00CPTUN5G,"When watching this movie you have to keep in mind that you should enjoy it for what it is. This isn't a masterpiece among animated film, it's no Toy Story 3. There's no escaping the fact that it's a marketing ploy to sell dolls. That being said, this is a really entertaining movie. Even though there's a drastic change in the design of the ponies now that they're human, the personalities and quirks of the characters still remain in tact ( Twilight Sparkle as a human is adorable) and they're is a abundance of little nods to My little Pony's older fans so it is very true to it's source material. I think the humor and animation(while stiff at times) is a lot fun and very expressive. However, I do have problems with this movie. One problem being the music. Now, I'm a huge fan of Daniel Ingram, a lot of the songs he composes for television match the quality to that of a motion picture. In this movie is filled with very generic sounding pop music and only one of the tracks really stand out(those of you who watch the movie probably know which one I'm talking about) All in all this is really just a longer episode of My little pony. There's no real offensive material or over the top girlyness. It's just a fun time for all ages!",1373846400,4,1237,4.359307359307359
5734533,5,B00CPTUN5G,My daughter is a big MLP fan and was curious about the Equestria Girls concept. We went to one of the screenings and we both loved it. It was really fun seeing all of the characters translated into humanoids and trying to find all of the parallels to the show. I think that the songs are really fun. And I think that they were pretty clever in the way that they made the parallel universe make sense. We both loved it and went to see a second showing and will be buying the dvd!,1373846400,4,478,4.095744680851064
5734534,5,B00CPTUN5G,"First, let me clear the air about something. This movie, while children are certainly justified to watch it, is more of a nod towards the Brony community itself, not the child demographic. That's why it was a little more heavy in terms of plot, character development, etc...
I, for one, absolutely loved it. I may appear to be biased because I am, in fact, a brony. However, my cousin is the one who gave me a ride; she has never watched ANYTHING with MLP on it, yet she even enjoyed the film.

This film is certainly child friendly because it has a great message and exemplifies the power of friendship! However, it is more for the brony community itself.

The film has many hilarious antics that you would see your pony pals doing back in Equestria, as well as the same warmth and heart put into it as the television program. I say watch it BEFORE you judge it!

PS: Also, (this is reference to that other reviewer) it wasn't a demon. It might have looked kind of like that, but it wasn't. It was simply the corruptness of disharmony that cause the transformation.",1373846400,2,1066,4.484536082474227

They could have made a better movie where twilight has to searsh all over the land of equestria in towns and citys. Citys like Mainhatin,phlydelphia,trotingham.hoofington,ponyvile,and canterlot to name a few from the cartoon.

ALSO, running for a dance? She could have just stolen the crown from the principals office and went back to equestria. It wouldn't have been that hard, also Sunset shimmer could have done the same thing. Poor writing to explain to the other ponies why twilight was there, pinkie just blurts it out in a paragraph breath.
The ending was just bad, it turned into sailor moon. Like I said, bad fanfiction writing. That's why I enjoyed this, because it was so bad. It was funny.
The art was very cute, I enjoyed that. Fluttershy was adorable, and I will be getting her figurine when it is available.
I like the opening theme, the remix was really cool. There was one song that I liked.
Also just sayin', ""this is our night"" did they even try with that song?",1372982400,10,920,4.323699421965318
5734537,5,B00CPTUN5G,"This movie is fantastic. Even if it doesn't have the song Equestria Girls that I same listed on the movie's WIKIPEDIA page. For me Helping Twilight Get Her Crown was my favorite song in the movie. I don't think Sunset Shimmer's demon form is any worst that either Nightmare Moon in the MLP TV series or even the evil Fairy in Disney Sleeping Beauty turning into a dragon. How they deal with Sunset Shimmer remind me very much with how Nightmare Moon was dealt with.

Hasbro did a good job picking the person who wrote some of the best and most popular episodes of the show to do the script of the movie. Its great watching Princess Twilight adjust to being human and the human world in the movie. Meeting Fluttershy for the first time is a revamp of their first meeting in Friendship is Magic season one. The movie has good anti bulling and believing in yourself theme to it without taking away the entertainment that made the series itself so great. I was surprise at Trixie's scene at the vending machine as before seeing the movie I was under the impression she was just in the back ground crowd to look for like many of the other characters.  The bits in the crystal empire with Flash Sentry was so good I'm sad he won't be part of series season 4. Since human Big Mac is skin tone like Doug was in Doug series shame they couldn't of stuck 1980s MLP  Megan into the human section of this world for those who grew up on original series.

There are some talk from Hasbro about an Equestria Girls spin off which I wouldn't mind as long as we keep Ponyville's Princess Twilight and not replace her with the always been human Twilight of that other world.",1372809600,15,1654,4.395424836601308

5734540,5,B00CPTUN5G,"The team at DHX media gives us another gem. This very easily could have been a 3 part episode in Season 4 without skipping a beat.  All that those who loves the show have come to expect is present here in spades.  Easter eggs for fans, nods to the other Pony universe, in jokes to those familiar with the TV Show and the adult fanbase, the amazing voice work, the great music, it is all hear.  The characters we know and love shine through, their bodies may be different shapes, but it's still the same Twilight, AJ, Dash, Fluttershy, Pinkie, Rarity, Luna, Celestia, etc that we have grown to know and love.  It didn't get boring once, the songs, while in a different style were still amazing and awesome, and catchy, Twilight has plenty of adorkable moments to enjoy, and the Magic of Friendship really does transcend all.  Even the romantic tension, which I expected to hate was handled well, and fit with the situation, and while the staff have said the events of the movie will not effect season 4....I find that almost disappointing, It would be nice to see how the experiences Twilight had would affect her in her new found role.

The only thing missing were the pony pets, no gummy, no opal (though she may have had a cameo with fluttershy) no tank, no owlowicious,.  They didn't really have a place in the film based on the pacing, the human world only has the one setting, the high school, but casual mention of them, when the girls meet Twilights ""dog"" would have been cool.

All in all, when I heard they were doing this I was turned off and disappointed, then I saw the trailers, and got excited for it, now that I have seen the movie, much like the Princess Twilight thing, I feel bad for jumping to conclusions, and I loved the experience fully.

If you're a mother you need to take your daughters to it, if you're an old school MLP fan, you need to see it! This is actually a great movie and has that old school feel. The music is catchy and you can get some fun out of it. The characters are endearing and I would if I have kids show this to them.

It's fun to see the pony equivalents as humans, but I did find the anorexic girls to be ugly to look at and the zombie/demon thing thing towards the end to be very jarring. I'd watch it again for entertainment, but I wouldn't let my daughter watch it, she's too young and wouldn't understand why the girls are so skinny, similar to the Monster High dolls. (Anorexia is hitting girls younger and younger, and I know a girl who was diagnosed at age 11, so I want to shield my children from the overly unrealistic body types) The characters look much cuter and more interesting as ponies in Equestria, so we'll stick to that.",1372377600,11,885,4.402439024390244

I highly doubt they'd do anything that gruesome in a movie like this, especially a KIDS show no less! Why are people making reviews of a trailer/movie that doesn't exist? What the....? -_-'

Anyway, onto the review of the ACTUAL movie:

Meghan McCarthy, you blew me away!!!!!!! I mean, WOW, I came into a theater with low expectations, but it pretty much blew my expectations off the wall! I like the fact that they actually establish a reason for Twilight to even go into this other dimension (aka the human world), since someone stole her crown to use it for diabolical deeds. This also had some nods from Season 1, episodes 1-2, where she had to make friends in order to reach her goal to not only retrieve her crown back, but also beat an enemy that wanted to take over the world, plus also had DERPY with a MUFFIN!!!! That made my day (what made it even more hilarious was that my friends didn't even notice Derpy walking in a song sequence, but a bunch of little kids saw her too)! lol XD

Again, this movie blew away my expectations in the water... I'll definitely buy this DVD/Blu-ray/Digital release! I mean only for $20? That's a deal right there!!!!

One more thing:

Quote from Pinkie Pie, ""I'm so NERVI-CITED!!!"" XD

Well, I hope we can see the home release come in soon (another month or so as stated in the release date)! It's a must-see for all people of different ages! Heck, if this movie got not only kids to see it, but also me and my friends to enjoy it, it's an AWESOME (20% cooler!) movie for sure! ;)",1372377600,3,1719,4.424050632911392
5734544,5,B00CPTUN5G,"I was a bit concerned about the whole humanized thing, but after seeing it a couple weeks ago, I love it. Personalities are intact, lots of easter eggs, and fun, if different and pop-y, music. The story is not a masterpiece of its ilk, but it works just fine. There are a few little hitches here and there, but I left that theater very happy that I made the effort to go see Equestria Girls.",1372204800,,391,4.226666666666667
5734545,4,B00CPTUN5G,"The interesting thing is the way Twilight Sparkle stays in the memory, taking on the dimensions of a real, tortured person. Most thrillers use interchangeable characters, and most pony movies are more interested in action than personality, but ""Equestria Girls"" is one of those special movies, like ""The Godfather,"" that is willing to take a flawed, evil pony and allow her to be human. Maybe it's no coincidence that Twilight Sparkle is played by Tara Strong, the same actor who played Michael Corleone.

Twilight Sparkle is a punk from Ponyville. The opening scene of the movie informs us that when Ponyville refugees were allowed to come to America in 1981, Princess Celestia had her own little private revenge -- and cleaned out his prison cells, sending us criminals along with his weary and huddled masses. We see Twilight Sparkle trying to bluff her way through an interrogation by US federal agents, and that's basically what she'll do for the whole movie: bluff. She has no real character and no real courage, although for a short time cocaine gives her the illusion of both.

""Equestria Girls"" takes its title from the 1932 Howard Hawks movie, which was inspired by the career of Al Capone. That Hawks film was the most violent gangster film of its time, and this 2013 film by Jayson Thiessen also has been surrounded by a controversy over its violence, but in both movies the violence grows out of the lives of the characters; it isn't used for thrills but for a sort of harrowing lesson about self-destruction. Both movies are about the rise and fall of a pony, and they both make much of the hero's neurotic obsession with her  sister, but the 1983 ""Equestria Girls"" isn't a remake, and it owes more to ""The Godfather"" than to Hawks.

That's because it sees its criminal so clearly as a person with a popular product to sell, working in a society that wants to buy. In the old days it was booze. For the Corleones, it was gambling and prostitution. Now it's cocaine. The message for the dealer remains the same: Only a fool gets hooked on his own goods. For Twilight Sparkle, the choices seem simple at first. She can work hard, be honest and make a humble wage as a dishwasher. Or she can work for organized crime, make herself more vicious than her competitors and get the big cars, the beautiful women and the boot-licking attention from nightclub doormen. She doesn't wash many dishes.

As Twilight Sparkle works her way into the south Florida illegal drug trade, the movie observes her with almost anthropological detachment. This isn't one of those movies where the characters all come with labels attached (""boss,"" ""lieutenant,"" ""hit man"") and behave exactly as we expect them to. Thiessen and his writer, Meghan McCarthy, have created a gallery of specific individuals, and one of the fascinations of the movie is that we aren't watching crime-movie clichs, we're watching people who are criminals.

Tara Strong does not make Twilight Sparkle into a sympathetic character, but she does make her into somebody we can identify with, in a horrified way, if only because of her perfectly understandable motivations. Wouldn't we all like to be rich and powerful, have desirable sex partners, live in a mansion, be catered to by faithful servants -- and hardly have to work? Well, yeah, now that you mention it. Dealing drugs offers the possibility of such a lifestyle, but it also involves selling your soul.

Twilight Sparkle gets it all and she loses it all. That's predictable. What is original about this movie is the attention it gives to how little Twilight Sparkle enjoys it while she has it. Two scenes are truly pathetic; in one of them, she sits in a nightclub with her blond mistress and her faithful sidekick, and she's so wiped out on cocaine that the only emotions she can really feel are impatience and boredom. In the other one, trying for a desperate transfusion of energy, she plunges his face into a pile of cocaine and inhales as if she were a drowning woman.

""Equestria Girls"" understands this criminal personality, with its links between laziness and ruthlessness, grandiosity and low self-esteem, pipe dreams and a chronic inability to be happy. It's also an exciting crime picture, in the tradition of the 1932 movie. And, like the ""Godfather"" movies, it's a gallery of wonderful supporting performances: Steven Bauer as a sidekick, Michelle Pfeiffer as a woman whose need for drugs leads her from one wrong lover to another, Robert Loggia as a mob boss who isn't quite vicious enough, and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio, as Twilight Sparkle's kid sister who wants the right to self-destruct in the manner of her own choosing.

These are the people Twilight Sparkle deserves in her life, and ""Equestria Girls"" is a wonderful portrait of a real louse.",1372032000,5,4788,4.850673194614443

My girls liked this movie, and I didn't feel bad about taking them. I didn't feel like I had to hide their eyes at any point, or remove them from the theater. Yes they had somewhat skimpy clothes, and Applejack straddling a chair in a skirt was a little over the top(nothing obviously showing), not something I want my girls doing, and that is why I knocked off half a star, but I come from the 80's gen that grew up with Barbie and Jem in short skirts, and Teela and She-ra running around in cheek hugging bathing suits, and I turned out to be a fairly conservative parent.  So really it's not that big a deal.

It was a genuinely good for kids kind of movie though, and taught about friendship, dealt with bullying(and standing up to one), and good overcoming bad. Being a parent does require being involved and talking about these things, and I'd say seeing this movie is a good segue into talking about these things to young girls.  The 'scary' part wasn't too bad, my 4yo was fine

Short skirts and all(not even too short), I WOULD get this for my young daughters. So if you are on the fence about whether or not to get this for your daughter, I would give this movie a G for great!",1371945600,110,1454,4.197132616487456
5734548,4,B00CPTUN5G,"I just saw this in the theater today with hubby & friends.  We went in with low expectations after seeing the trailers, but we were willing to give it a shot based on how much we love the tv show.  It was better than we expected!  Not super awesome, not my favorite movie, but it was enjoyable.

It keeps the same spark of humor that the tv show has.  Twilight's reaction to being human & having to learn how to move and interact with people was hilarious.  Spike being a dog was fine, it was handled well.  The other 5 of the main 6 characters had been friends but broken apart after Sunset Shimmer's meddling.  They were able to talk about their misunderstandings, realize that they'd all been duped, and mend their friendships.

The stereotypical ""become popular to win the princess contest"" plot felt fresh.  It wasn't the same old stale high school drama.  And although they did introduce awareness of dating (Flash Sentry asks Twilight to the dance, and he is Sunset Shimmer's ex-boyfriend) it was a fresh twist of the stereotype because Twilight has better things to worry about.  So much so that she pretty much brushed him off and the poor guy had to ask her three times.

The plot line to get her crown felt rushed to me.  She had three days to get the crown, but really only about one day to win over the entire school to vote for her.  Though other people said the pacing felt fine to them.  So maybe it's just me.

I don't usually pay a whole lot of attention to the songs but the opening music was AWESOME.  It's a revamped, techno remix kind of deal with lots of energy.  I'd be totally ok with them using that for the season 4 opening music if they wanted to.

The only major drawback for me was the fight at the end.  As another reviewer mentioned, Sunset Shimmer turns into this winged demon thing when she puts on Twilight's crown.  Then she puts the high schoolers under a mind control spell and wants to go take over Equestria.  It was jarring and took me out of the experience.  It wasn't really scary, just stupid.  It doesn't last very long though because when she tries to attack Twilight & Co. with the magic, it doesn't work because the magic is really Twilight's.  Twilight & Co. save the day, have a party, and she goes home.

Overall I recommend this movie to Pony fans.  It has it's shark-jumping moments but overall it's pretty true to the heart of the tv series.",1371859200,,2395,4.406392694063927
5734549,5,B00CPTUN5G,"If you haven't heard yet, the Blu-ray version of this movie is in 5.1 DTS HD Master Audio, the best sound quality you can get out of a Blu-ray. Shout Factory went all out with the making of this Blu-ray and it sounds tremendous.

5734551,5,B00CPTUN5G,"So there are a lot of joke reviews on here right now, but here's some real talk: I just got back from seeing Equestria Girls and it really is excellent. The MLP cast and crew have created a movie that has every bit as much heart, magic, and quality as the series. The humor is still intelligent, the animation is still gorgeous, the characters are still themselves, and the writing is just as snappy and spirited as you'd expect from Meghan McCarthy. Don't judge Equestria Girls without giving it a chance, you'll be missing out on a gem of a film and a worthy addition to this generation of My Little Pony.",1371340800,153,607,4.428571428571429
5734552,5,B00CPTUN5G,"I was given the chance to watch this at a recent brony convention and needless to say I was quite blown away by the dark undertones that this film showed. At the same time, I was absolutely impressed by the quality of the animation and the overall story's relevance to modern day issues we face including child abuse, terrorism, and inner-city poverty, topics rather unexpected within the context of the show. Of course, this is definitely not for children due to its rating, but that does not detract from it being a true masterpiece to add to your film collection.

It became clear within the first ten minutes that the R-rating was well-deserved. Without spoiling too much, I did not expect the filmmakers to kill off Rarity and Rainbow Dash even before the title shot, nor did I expect the realistic references to the recent Boston Marathon bombings (this took place during the Wonderbolts Derby, approx. 10 years after Season 3). When the Royal Guards were waterboarding Fluttershy, I honestly cried my eyes out, and as it was, well, there's a reason they call it ""My Little Pony: Fall"".

I did not initially understand the comments and reviews concerning the Nazi references in the film until I watched it; now I knew Queen Chrysalis was quite evil from her appearance at the Season 2 finale but I never expected her to be THAT despicable until she murdered the princesses and took over Equestria within a fortnight. Just... wow. I later found out on numerous forums that this project was months in the making and was meant to make up for the dismal PR backlash that Hasbro has found itself in as of late within the brony community.

The character development shown in this film is quite unexpected; I found myself being able to relate to Twilight Sparkle even more now and their take on her persecution under the Chrysalic Regime due to her autism was something to ponder long after the film. In fact, when the credits rolled, there was complete silence in the auditorium for a minute before everybody began excitedly talking to one another in heated discussion over what they just saw.

I think that dhx media really outdid themselves this time and I have Daniel Ingram's soundtrack for this film on my iPod along with other greats like Hans Zimmer and Zack Hemsey. I will definitely preorder this and overall, I think that if you initially choose to eschew this film for its seemingly sappy MLP material, I assure you that you are truly missing out on a work of art for the modern age.",1369353600,10,2494,4.687214611872146
5734553,3,B00CPTUN5G,"I have to say upfront that although I'm a massive fan of just about every Zombie genre out there, I've never really seen the appeal of the animated ones.  I mean, anime is one thing, but everything else just seems a bit too ""Scooby-Doo on Zombie Island""-esque to me.  So if you go in for cartoons trying to figure out how to hold on to humanity, add a star to my review.

That said, MLP:F holds its own in a genre plagued by bad attempts to bring something fresh to the same tired old storylines and resurrected plot elements (pardon the puns).  The acting (I guess you'd call it voice acting?) was good enough - it didn't sound like a bunch of morons moaning into a microphone while someone showed a cartoon with the noise turned down.  Cathy Weseluck of course stole the show in the scene where Spike beheads zombie Rarity, only to have Babs and Tiara show up with the antidote too late.  The animation came so close to anime, I kept wondering why the characters weren't wearing sailor moon outfits, until I reminded myself it's Hasbro, not DeviantArt.  Plot was the usual ""apocalypse breaks out during the 1st princess games, survivors picked off one by one as they walk the train tracks out of Canterlot, trying to get home"".  The Zecora/everfree forest part should have been it's own movie, or just dumped for time and cohesiveness.  But at least now we'll understand why AliTwi got herself banished to the EquestriaGirls world with her memories intact.

Oh, and of course, the climactic ZombieShy/FlutterDead clone battle in Apploosa made me like and hate the outcome at the same time.  On one hand, I'll never think of that shade of yellow without hurling.  On the other hand, no matter how good the animation, you can't get me to belive a pony can do those things with a sword - I don't care how many amulets you're wearing.

I thought the setting would have made faster zombies preferable, although the slow Zombie Dash scenes were particularly tender.

I suppose the fanbase needs the following: Derpy is best still-alive pony, Cheerilee is best zombie pony.  Zombie Nightmare Moon was redundant and stupid.",1369353600,6,2117,4.683783783783784
5734554,5,B00CPTUN5G,"On a dark night filled with even darker magics, an insane cult attempts to give Nightmare Moon a body and life of her own, utterly separate from Princess Luna. But, when the spell is interrupted by Celestia, something unexpected is created.

Now, an little black alicorn filly named Nyx finds herself living under the care of Twilight Sparkle, only to be haunted by memories and emotions from her past. Is she Nightmare Moon reborn or is she simply a doppelganger with a soul and mind of her own? Can Twilight Sparkle protect Nyx from those refuse to see past her dragon eyes and black coat?

Or, will Nyx be forced to inherit the sins that may not even be hers and become the greatest evil Equestria has ever known?

Tara Strong's performance as Twilight Sparkle is definatly Oscar worthy, and I'm glad to see that Pen Stroke's ""Past Sins"" has been made canon. The movie is darker then you'd see in the show, but that's a good thing in this case, although it's not enough to get the R rating it has, but that's probably because there's a bit of blood shown. The 3-D was probably the best I've ever seen, especially for an animated film.

Overall, you gotta see this. Oh, and stick around after the credits.",1369267200,3,1207,4.522935779816514
5734555,4,B00CPTUN5G,"I felt the movie was good for the target audience of young girls.  The only problem was a demon at the end that might scare some of the youngest viewers.

For fans of My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic, there are lots of easter eggs, such as Scootaloo doing the chicken dance and Fluttershy's meeting Spike paralleling her original meeting Spike as a pony.  (For non-fans, Scootaloo is a young pegasus type pony who was called a chicken by one of her friends.)  Others aren't as obvious and can only be seen by watching the background characters.  Watch to the end of the credits to find all the easter eggs.

Music for the movie was not of the same sort as in the broadcast series.  Dan Ingram, who writes the song for MLP also wrote the songs for the EqG movie.  But he wrote the songs in a pop music style that will appeal to children.  Don't expect ""The Art of the Dress"" or ""Winter Wrap Up"".  I didn't find the songs very memorable the first time I heard them, but they weren't objectional.

The biggest weakness in the plot is the speed that the villain changes after she has lost.  That isn't uncommon for the My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic television series.  Where most sitcoms dwell on otherwise admirable characters behaving badly, MLP tends to have characters change when shown that they are wrong.  The reasons that the characters change are not necessarily spelled out, which may be why the program resonates with so many older viewers.  Viewers associate their own motives with the characters.  Those motives can be complex or simple as the viewer choses.

Over all, it was fun and entertaining.  The script and soundtracks were both far beyond what is normally found in children's programming, especially programming for little girls.  If I could have stayed in the theater for a second showing, I would have done so.",1369267200,23,1839,4.65527950310559

5734559,5,B00CPTUN5G,"At first I was unsure, if this movie really is, what one would expect from an R-Rating, but as soon as the Blu-Ray was delivered and I could take a look at the cover, all my doubts were blown away. The cover, depicting the smouldering ruins of Canterlot, gave a good idea of what the movie would be like, and why it is called ""Fall"".
Starting with a normal day in Equestria, the movie soon takes a turn and shows how powerless a kingdom which had never faced anything like it can be. Following the destruction of its capital, the antagonistic army soon enslaves the whole nation and forces them to work in their mines. Then, after the former princesses and rebellion leaders are captured and imprisoned in an unknown place, the last hope for freedom is destroyed.
While this movie seems to be part of the MLP franchise, it shows a dystopian future, in which the whole kingdom is destroyed and enslaved. With all these dark elements it for sure is no movie meant for kids but the animation style, showing all the character's emotions and feelings in such a great detail give the movie a never before known feeling and should definitely be seen by every adult.
I sincerely hope, that there will be a sequel in which the ponies free themselves from the enslavement and reconquer their lost land.",1369267200,15,1292,4.573275862068965

5734561,5,B00CPTUN5G,"This movie is not at all what most people would expect. Hasbro has long neglected its older fans, so it seemed that they were completely unaware of them. Little did they realize that this was coming out.

Set several years after the end of the television series, My Little Pony: Fall is squarely aimed at older audiences than the main of the TV series. While you will hear about the references to Nazis in the other reviews, the imagery is contextualized - indeed, the movie probably would have gotten a PG 13 rating if it had not been for the MPAA's deep concern about children watching this movie. It isn't THAT bad.

The movie, despite its higher rating, does indeed remain about friendship, and the story is a very central one, one that I think many older fans needed to learn: Just because your friends move away and pursue their own lives does not mean that they cannot remain your friends. The main cast, along with Spike, come back together to confront their latest challenge. The movie is gritter than the rest of the series, but it is not gratuitously so, and indeed, much of the dialogue is exactly what you have come to know and love.

There ARE a lot of in jokes in the movie that general audiences likely won't catch, but I suspect they won't actually be hurt by their lack of understanding of them; the story does stand on its own.

The fandom will rejoice though - Luna makes her appearance here, as does Trixie, though contrary to the posters the latter only shows up for a limited time in the movie. And while it was darker than the series in general, it still ends on a good note, I think, even if it is rather bittersweet.

Note that it is WELL worth watching through the credits, as the movie has a fairly long stinger afterwards which wraps things up nicely.

This movie is not for SMALL kids, but I'd say most kids over the age of 10 won't be too frightened by it. I would have been fine watching it as a kid, so use your judgement - if your kid seeing violence on-screen would alarm them, this movie is not for them. But it isn't gorn or anything, though there is certainly blood, I think it is mostly quite tasteful, and probably no more psychologically scarring than, say, All Dogs Go to Heaven (goodness knows how THAT got a G-rating).

And as some others have noted: both the music and animation in this are absolutely stunning. They really went all out on it.",1369267200,4,2388,4.425968109339408
5734562,5,B00CPTUN5G,"No matter how three-dimensional and complex our beloved pony friends are, there is only so much they can do, since MLP IS a kids show. As such, we don't really get a chance to see what the Mane Six would do or how they would behave in more adult situations. However, all bets are of in this film as we follow our heroines on their journey as they fight for friendship and the burdens it brings. A bittersweet tale of harmony and chaos, justice and corruption, integrity and deception, love and betrayal, this film will not only leave you begging for more, in the end it will make you ask yourself, ""Who are my friends?Where are they?""

But who am I to judge? Take a sneak-peak of one of the scenes from the film and let it speak for itself.
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Rarity rested her gun, barrel pointing directly at Rainbow's chin

Rarity: ""Ever read The Astral Prophesies, Rainbow?""

Rainbow: ""Not regularly, no.""

Rarity: ""Well there's a passage that really captured my imagination. Starswirl 25:17. 'The path of the righteous mare is beset on all sides by the inequities of the selfish, and the tyranny of evil mares. Blessed is she who, in the name of harmony and friendship, shepherds the weak through the Longest Night. For she is truly her sisters friend, and the finder of wayward fillies.

And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger, those who would attempt to poison and destroy my sisters, and you will know my name is Celestia, when I shine my justice upon you.'

I've been mulling over those words for years, and if you ever heard it, why, a Lady would not describe what might occur. But its true meaning ever eluded me. It certainly served as a rather dramatic twist to an otherwise, and perhaps undeservedly, pragmatic and straightforward situation. But there were... events, this morning, which gave me pause for thought.
It could mean that you're the mean old mare, and I the righteous filly. Tom, here, he's the shepherd gallantly defending my righteous derriere through my own Longest Night. Or it could mean that you're the righteous mare, and I'm the shepherd, and all of Equestria is evil and selfish.

I'd like that, but it just doesn't ring true. The truth is Dashie, that you're the weak, and I'm the tyranny and sighs selfishness. But I'm trying. I'm trying to be the shepherd.""
