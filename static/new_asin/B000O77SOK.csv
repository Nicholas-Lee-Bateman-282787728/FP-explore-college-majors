2792042,5,B000O77SOK,"I received Season 1 last week. I love it! I never missed this show when it was in Prime time and still watch reruns almost daily on tv. Now Season One is finally on DVD. Thia is one of the best Series out there. You have suspense, law, romance, friendship, triumph and tragedy. What more could one ask for? I hope it does not take long for the other Seasons of The Practice to come out on DVD. Fans have waited long enough. Get us the rest of the Seasons please!",1182211200,12,462,4.087912087912088
2792043,5,B000O77SOK,Probably one of the best legal dramas out there. It has been awhile that Season 2 is being sold unboxed here at Amazon and at the Ipod store. When is FOX releasing the actual DVDs? I don't want to watch this in my computer and lose them after I reformat my hard drive.,1181088000,,268,4.0754716981132075
2792044,5,B000O77SOK,"I obtained a copy of this in Australia, which I am assuming is exactly the same as the one listed here as they have the same cover and release date.

The episodes included are not the ones previously listed that were apparently the 'original full season one', but are the complete season one and the first seven episodes of season two:

Pilot

Part 1

Trial & Error

Part IV

Part V

Part IV

Reasonable Doubts

Betrayal

The Blessing

Dog Bite

First Degree

Sex, Lies & Monkeys

Search & Seizure

Plus one special feature called 'Setting Up The Practice'.",1181088000,8,557,4.540816326530612
2792045,4,B000O77SOK,I AM SO GLAD THAT THEY ARE RELEASING THIS SHOW... FINALLY!!! I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR FOREVER TO SEE THIS OUT ON DVD.  I AM SO EXCITED!!,1180396800,2,135,4.0
2792046,5,B000O77SOK,"I have been checking the local stores about the release of this amazing TV series that has grown up with me with lots of tracing and enjoyment. Eventually, having resolved those strategic issues (thought it couldn't be technical or legal or else), marketers 'produced' them and made them available to us.  But we had to wait another month, vs 10 years from the original production?  Strange marketing plans.  Can't wait to get them out here in Hong Kong and hopefully it will get distributed in the right channel and more importantly in the right prices.

Look forward to have these titles helping me to pick up my childhood's memories.",1177977600,,636,4.807339449541284
2792047,5,B000O77SOK,"This show was a fine example of successfully mixing torts with the titillating with a good balance that has eluded so many other courtroom dramas over the years. The premise of the show is that Bobby Donnell is the head of a law firm that is barely managing to keep itself financially afloat due to the kinds of cases that the firm takes and the fact that they have trouble collecting their fees from more than a few of their clients. However, these lawyers are the kind of people you would always want on your side. They have a can-do attitude and seem to relish an uphill fight. In fact, at several points in the show, they remind one another that the reason they took on the uncertainty and lesser remuneration of starting their own law firm was so that they could choose their battles rather than work for a big firm where the price of financial safety would be representing big corporate clients, right or wrong. Although this show has a large sexual component, it has several average looking and even outright plain looking folk as regular castmembers. Furthermore, these average looking people, with more than their share of physical flaws, are actually given meaningful personal lives. Creator David E. Kelley actually wrote five of the first six episodes of the first season, and it shows in the performances. Unlike many shows where the characters struggle to figure out who they are, these actors and actresses have their personalities down pat with their opening lines.

Since this DVD is recreating season one of ""The Practice"" as it was originally planned, we will be missing some of the highlights of season two. First off, the romance between Bobby Donnell and Helen Gamble has a long build-up, a short duration in season two, and a long period of reprisals before the two finally become friends. These episodes will be missing from this installment. Also, Joey Heric, a flamboyent defendant who makes several appearances over the years and is excellently played by John Larroquette, will be missing from this volume. He makes his first appearance in ""Betrayal"", which is not on this set. Joey always looks embarrassingly guilty of whatever homicide he happens to be accused and has a ""I Dare You to Convict Me"" attitude.

If you watched Ally McBeal, another David E. Kelley legal show also based in Boston, you'll probably notice that these two shows are sharing more than a few judges, which only makes sense if you think about it. Removing the seven episodes from volume one, that leaves 21 episodes remaining for the actual season two as it was broadcast. I hope this means future volumes of this show will end on actual season boundaries, since several seasons end with cliffhangers and busting up the seasons any further would rather ruin the continuity of it all.",1175558400,15,2786,4.81419624217119

I've jumped through hoops to buy season 1, cause I live in Brazil and it's not available here. And I've been waiting for the other seasons ever since. This was a great show, so marvellous it's magic went on to Boston Legal (which I have the complete show) and still lives on. But us fans are unable to buy it. It's ridiculous. There's all this fight agains piracy, but, hey, if you're not going to release the show for us to buy, you should at least support people who have recorded it in good condition and are willing to share it with others! It's an utter disrespect to customers to release seasons 1 and 8 in DVD, season 2 only for download and, hey, good luck with the other ones!",1396915200,29,799,4.369127516778524

2792203,5,B000O77SOK,"No idea what the studio heads were thinking by the time this series wound down but THE WORST decision the network made was to let this stellar cast of characters and writers slip from their fingers like water through a sieve.  From start to finish, this show outshined the lot and I was deeply sorry and hurt for the cast members near the end for all the controversy that swirled around two main actors/characters in the end - namely Dylan McDermott & Lara Flynn Boyle.  Word on the street was that they found out that they were being let go through the media and not directly from their bosses.  Incredible!  And harder yet to believe was that I couldn't find it on store shelves anywhere when I fully expected a box set release. This has truly been one of the best purchases I've made this year with no regrets.  Fans of the show will be watching this one over and over again for it's character portrayals, storylines and sheer entertainment of some of the best closing arguments ever filmed.

2792246,5,B000O77SOK,"The Practice is one of the best legal dramas I have watched, and I'm furious that all of the seasons have not been released on DVD (or onto Hulu, Netflix, Amazon, etc.). I watched Seasons 1 and 2 on Hulu (or maybe Netflix?), and that was a few years ago. Since then, I keep checking to see if the rest of the seasons are available, and they're still not available. So frustrating. The actors on this series did an amazing job and won a ton of Emmys; I can't believe the idiots at Medium Rare Entertainment who bought the rights to The Practice are going to let all that footage gather dust and not see the light of day again.

2792302,5,B000O77SOK,"Every so often, a program on television transcends the medium and becomes such a riveting, emotionally-compelling yet intellectually-stimulating experience for viewers willing to engage themselves in it. In 1997, David E. Kelley reached a crescendo in his creative writing with the debut of ""The Practice"", which abandoned the light-hearted, quirky ""dram-edies"" that viewers previously associated him with in ""LA Law"" and ""Ally McBeal"" in favor of a truer, less-heralded look at the moral and professional dilemmas attorneys and prosecutors face within the judicial system. From it's debut, the show's storylines always seemed to touch on many of the issues and situations from real world news - be it the death penalty; assisted suicides; the sanctity of attorney-client privilege; or challenges to religious themes. The scripts were superbly supported by an extremely underrated yet exception cast - highlighted by then-little known Dylan McDermott in the lead as Bobby Donnell. McDermott's ability to convey passion and emotion, either in staunch support of his client and profession or in humility and vulnerability as a man struggling with his internal demons and sense of morality, was reason enough to watch this series every year but, when his ensemble added in brilliant efforts by Steve Harris (Eugene Young), Camryn Manheim (Ellenor Frutt), Michael Badalucco (Jimmy Berlutti) Kelli Williams (Lindsay Dole) and Lisa Gay Hamilton (Rebecca Washington), the overall result was incredibly captivating.

A major part of the engine driving the weekly storylines was the duality Kelley used in revealing the legal issues and challenges from both sides of the ""fence""; the obvious perspective from the defense attorney's side was a given but gained significant appeal and interest for the viewer when balanced against their opponents, the district attorneys representing the state. From the 2nd season through the 7th season, Lara Flynn Boyle was a mix between a fierce adversary and a sympathetic ally as one ADA; in between, some wonderful characters in the DA office (Jason Kravits as the pack-dog DA Richard Bay in Seasons 4-5; Bill Smitrovich as the jaded and bitter DA Kenneth Walsh in Seasons 6-7 were 2 of the more prominent ones) were wonderful as opposing forces for the law firm. Add in equally colorful and distinctly diverse acting performances by several of the judges that recurred throughout the run of the show and a viewer couldn't help but fall in love with this show. Behind all of that was an incredible use of lighting, instrumental music, photography, sets and film techniques used to separate the simultaneous storylines with the different characters.

In a nutshell, the first 7 seasons with largely the same cast offered its TV audience a wonderful blend of legal drama that was built around the full range of emotions inherent in the law. Sadly, due to production costs that were mandated by ABC to be cut in the wake of a crippling shift in the show's scheduling (from its ratings-winning home on Sundays for the first 6-1/2 seasons to Monday half-way through the 7th season), the series underwent a massive (and in my mind, unjustified) overhaul by eliminating the majority of the regular cast (including McDermott, Williams, Boyle and Hamilton).

While the 8th and final season offered some remaining appeal with the retention of Harris, Manheim and Badalucco, the shift to James Spader in the lead led to far more eccentric, off-the-wall cases and stories that seemed to try to ""lighten"" some of the grittiness that was intrinsic in the previous 7 seasons and make Spader's character (Alan Shore) the focal point of every episode. Kelley admittedly was already developing an off-shoot series centered around Spader that eventually materialized into ""Boston Legal"" after ABC canceled ""The Practice"".

All I can say is that, for me personally, ""The Practice"" remains one of my all-time favorite shows. Whether it was ""realistic"" in how it portrayed the law is open for debate but, given that Kelley is a lawyer-turned-writer, it appeared very credible and, more importantly, very entertaining and stimulating to watch. For anyone who craves a viewing experience that captures all of the desired qualities I mentioned (great acting, stories, production), you owe it to yourself to invest in the only DVD release to date.",1286755200,2,4350,5.245689655172414

It's the first season (six episodes) and then some of the episodes from the second season.  The first season shows the firm as it struggles to maintain viability while the lawyers are trying small-time misdemeanors from a shoddy office.

2792306,5,B000O77SOK,"The Practice is one of the best, thought-provoking, intelligently-written shows on TV with brilliant acting to boot! This is the show that had made me love everything legal. Given the show's excellent caliber and accolades, its successful eight-year run, the exponentially insistent demand from the devotees and the fact that it'd been 2 long years since volume 1 had been released, I'm profoundly incredulous and frustrated as to why the remaining seasons aren't yet out on DVD.

Virtually every single show is out on DVD (and some of these shows aren't as brilliant as The Practice), save for this! It's rumored that the music rights is attributable to the protracted delay but nevertheless it shouldn't take THIS L O N G! All of Boston Legal's five seasons (my other favorite show that's secondary to The Practice) are available on DVD even though it is The Practice's successor, therefore the bone of contention cannot be the music rights.

Whatever it may be, I along with a legion of die-hard fans are incredibly TIRED of waiting!! I need my court-room drama fix that only The Practice can satiate (well, that and to stare into Dylan McDermott's baby blues). PLEASE release the remaining seasons of this exceptionally magnificent and addictive show and don't make us wait till 2010 for the long-awaited volume 2 and another ten years for the rest of the seasons! The wait has been long enough.

Update:

I can't believe it's been a year and a half since I've written my review and STILL the remaining seasons are a no-show! Wth! Fox would witness a significant boost in sales if they just released it! Fox is the worst studio ever! They're notorious for cancelling good shows so why should THIS come as any surprise. Every time I go to the video store, I see crappy series being released, not to mention FULL series release, and stellar shows like The Practice, The Nanny and Just Shoot me to name few have not yet been fully released and waves of annoyance and disgust would roll over me.

2792308,4,B000O77SOK,"If you'/re looking for a TV show with superb acting, interesting storylines and plot twists that will make you jump out of your seat, look no further than ""The Practice"".

Before it came to an inevitable end in 2004 after eight seasons, the latter of which increasing in decline, David E. Kelley's TV show about a law practice with a lot of passion and dedication who would stop at nothing for justice was one of the best shows on television.  Unfortunately Season 1, which was released in 2007, is currently the only available season on DVD.

The show took place in Boston and featured the firm of Robert Donnell and Associates, later changing its name over time with the addition and removal of members.

Dylan McDermott stars as Bobby Donnell, who has so much passion and heart that you are swept up in his emotions right along with him.  He cares as deeply about his associates' victories as he does for his own.  He sometimes loses his temper but can be made to see the hope when it looks like there isn't any left.

Steve Young is Eugene, the former private investigator turned defense attorney who is as good at quick wit as he is with law.  This is evident when, in one episode at the beginning of the series, he is walking through a jail, stops and asks the men behind bars, ""how many of you here DIDN'T do it?"", which is met with a chorus of protests begging to be heard.

Kelli Williams is Lindsay, the highly intelligent newbie lawyer who achieves an almost impossible victory in the beginning episodes of the show and gives you a great insight to her fierce tenacity.  She has a strong need to get it right and her naivete decreases with her experience and exposure to more cases.

Camryn Manheim is Ellenor, another excellent lawyer who often times gets carried away and ends up in more trouble than she realizes.  A main theme explored for Ellenor is her hopes of finding love, which she has quite terrible luck in, to say the least, as the series progresses.

Michael Badalucco is Jimmy Berluti, who helps Bobby out in a big way in the beginning of the series but gets fired for it due to a lack of ethics.  So to help Jimmy right back, Bobby hires him to work with the practice, since Jimmy was a former lawyer.  Unfortunately, he was never any good.  He never won a case.

Lisa Gay Hamilton is Rebecca who, at the beginning of the series, is the office receptionist.  She and Bobby started his practice together.  She helps to center Bobby when he allows himself to fall into despair.

Lara Flynn Boyle joins the cast in Season 2 as Helen Gamble, the main prosecutor who has a brief fling with Bobby but ultimately respects his firm.  However, put up against them in court, she will stop at nothing to gain her victory.

Every case is interesting.  Every character is dynamic.  The acting is brilliant and the surprises will keep your interest.  If you loved L.A. Law, you should definitely check this out, since Kelley created that also.  But if you love law shows in general, especially well-acted ones, than you should not miss ""The Practice"".",1250467200,5,3064,4.545620437956204

It is PLOT DRIVEN - no car chases here, just superlative dialogue perfectly delivered by highly talented actors, at the top of their profession.

The plot lines are sharp, edgy, atmosphereic,(sometimes truly chilling, even dark - not for the faint hearted). In short 'The Practice' is what television drama SHOULD be, and COULD be, but seldom is.

Shades of gray in the law itself are debated, along with the biases of everyone involved.

2792365,5,B000O77SOK,"It is fascinating how David Kelly mixes law practice with the human controversies of the lawyers. I just want to define The Practice as the cream of the cream of all lawyer's series and movies, Boston Legal is not even close to the quality of The Practice. Hope second season will be release soon, I want the whole 8 seasons.

2792366,5,B000O77SOK,"I started watching the Practice on FX after becoming a fanatic fan of Boston Legal, the show's spin-off.  The final season of the Practice features the characters of Alan Shore and Denny Crane who are the main characters of BL.  However, after watching the 8th season, I watched the entire run of the Practice on FX.  The show is absolutely brilliant.  Quite different from BL, it depicts the truly gritty world of defense attorneys struggling to keep their humanity while constantly putting drug dealers and murders back on the street.  Much more serious, dramatic, but just as good and the acting is fantasic!  I just hope that Fox chooses to keep releasing future volumes and do so soon!",1187395200,5,690,4.805084745762712
2792367,5,B000O77SOK,"David E. Kelley created ""The Practice"" to be the flip side of ""L.A. Law,"" the show for which he wrote 67 episodes and won his first Emmys.  Bobby Donell and his partners are not a prestigious law firm in Hollywood, they are scrambling to stay solvent in Bean Town and do it defending clients who are so obviously guilty it is painful.  The series lasted eight episodes before it morphed into ""Boston Legal,"" and the keystone for the series was how both sides were always passionate about their positions, and somtimes too passionate.  Cold logic is rarely the key to courtroom success in this series, which is just as well because you have clients that run the spectrum from ""Free Willy,"" who likes to expose himself in public, to Gerald Braun, who murders his daughter's killer with the approval of his rabbi.  Not surprisingly, these cases take multiple episodes to resolve.

Pay attention to the fact that this is ""The Practice: Volume One"" and not ""The Practice: Season One.""  The show was a replacement series that first aired on March 4, 1997, and the first season was just six episodes.  The second season was a whopping 28 episodes, so the first seven are included in this set of 4-discs.  That still leaves 21 episodes from the second season to make up ""Volume Two"" down the road.  This line of demarcation strikes me as strange because 20 episodes on five discs would seem to make more sense, but once we see the next volume the rationale should become clear.

Watching these early episodes again it was interesting to see how Kelley takes advantage of what is a large cast for a ""small"" law firm.  Having a favorite is problematic because they might not have a case go to trial for a while (Eleanor always seems to be second chair early on).  But everybody pretty gets their chance to shine: Bobby defending Rachel Reynolds in the ""Pilot,"" Lindsey takes on the tobacco company defended by her law professor (""Part IV""), Eugene making a bet with a prosecutor on the case of Steven Frenault arrested for armed robbery (""Part V""), Jimmy with a little girl bit by a dog (""Dog Bite""), and Eleanor sued by George Vogleman (""Sex, Lies, and Monkeys"").

This is a show where the judges matter, with Linda Hunt as Judge Zoey Hiller clearly standing out along with Ed Asner as Judge Matlin Pratt in ""The Blessing.""  One of the fun things is seeing familiar faces as judges, from Ron Glass to Armin Shimerman, but what the judges have to say about the lawyers (on both sides) is part of the equation.  Sometimes the clients take over the show, of which there is no better example than John Larroquette as Joey Heric in ""Betrayal,"" although I also remember John Carroll Lynch as Dr. Robert Larson in ""Search and Seizure,"" the final episode in this collection.  Obviously, those who caught all eight seasons watch these early ones knowing what is going to happen with Vogleman, Heric, and other memorable clients as well as with the lawyers who defend them.  Kelley made sure his shows were always watchable, but I have a slight preference for these early episodes when the cases were smaller and not always at the nexus of a whole bunch of issues.",1185235200,74,3145,4.658227848101266

I have finally been able to purchase the first season on DVD, and it's fantastic!  In addition to the original episodes, it has some great commentary on how the show evolved from its original concept.  This was one of the best acted and written series ever, and I can't imagine anyone but Dylan McDermott playing the hunk, Bobby.  I am so anxious to get the rest of the set.

I am out of words to describe how fabulous this TV series is.  Anyway, if you like court drama, this is definitely something one cannot miss.  No weird things, but Dick Wolf did a great job of writing the scripts.  Cross-examination is certainly something you can learn things while enjoying the show.",1491350400,6,595,4.556603773584905
