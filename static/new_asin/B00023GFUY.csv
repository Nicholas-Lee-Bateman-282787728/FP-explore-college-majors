2058251,5,B00023GFUY,"Family Reunion is my favorite of Tyler's Perry's stage plays. This story begins with a funeral, a family reunion, and finally a wedding.

It shows the strength of a family when going through both good times and bad times.

This play also has some of Tyler's best comedic lines as Madea.",1123113600,10,286,4.588235294117647
2058252,4,B00023GFUY,"The first time I saw a Tyler Perry play was Madea's Family Reunion and from there I was hooked.  This DVD captured the pure magic of Tyler and the character Madea is hilarious.  Whenever I need a laugh or have my spirits lifted, this is the first thing I place in my DVD player.  It's funny, positive, spiritual, uplifting and the cast is great. I would defiantly recommend this product!!!",1122940800,15,389,4.5285714285714285
2058253,5,B00023GFUY,"I am a fan of Tyler Perry's Productions.  I already pre-ordered the  dvd of the movie ""Diary of a Mad Black Woman"".  Tyler never fails to demonstrate the importance of family and friendship.  He brings that important fact back to reality in his productions.  I got so much out of this through the laughter that is non-stop.  Tyler is a God-fearing talented man.",1119830400,16,361,4.650793650793651
2058254,5,B00023GFUY,"GGGGGGGGGGRRRRRRRRRRREEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAATTTTTTTTTTT

This is a wonderful wholesome movie to watch, I love Madea and all her characters in the play especially when she and Mr Browne go at it about being neighbours and the fact that they do not like each others ways and habits.  Vicky is also a character to watch where she comes into Madea's yard and finds Mr Browne in there with a yellow shower cap, bunny slippers and a panda coloured towel wrapped around him which she found oddly strange and the response she gave Browne had me rolling around.

I also recommend 'Diary of a Mad Black Woman' by the said Tyler Perry but there are two with the same title, there is the movie and there is the stage play.  Wonderful , wonderful.  Invest in it and you will not be disappointed, I sure wasn't...

WONDERFUL MR TYLER PERRY KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK.......",1118188800,13,858,4.724832214765101

2058312,5,B00023GFUY,"Madea and the regular cast of characters has come a long way since the time that this play came out. I remember when we first heard that the Brown's were getting a TV show. I just knew then that it wouldn't be the same because it was being shown on a network and all of their restrictions.

I enjoy watching these older Madea plays when Tyler Perry was a little more raw and creative. These plays are his roots and what gave him the foothold to move up in his career.

The singing this this play, like in many TP plays, is ridiculously good. It's fun, high energy, silly goodness.",1474416000,,580,4.263636363636364

2058446,5,B00023GFUY,"Tyler Perry movies are wonderfully entertaining, bright, spiritual, funny....I could go on.  I am a fan. If you liked one of his movies, watch the play of the same title.  Most all, if not all, started out as a play, and you get more insight into the story, the characters, the actors, the meaning, and Tyler himself.  He often goes ""off script"".  Hysterically funny!",1408838400,,367,4.6875

Love the interaction between Madea & Mr. Brown.  They are perfect foils for one-another.

2058476,3,B00023GFUY,"Obviously one of the earlier recordings. This theatrical performance has way too much going on with a lot of loud characters constantly talking over one another.

It is just too busy for my taste.",1402963200,,346,4.507936507936508

I bought it for my son for a college course that he was taking, and I have watched it several times.

There are plenty of characters, but each of them are unique and are well acted.  All of the characters are based on people you have known or heard about, so the story really feels like it could your own family.  Because of that, it makes you feel like you can overcome anything in your family if you keep trying.  There is a heavy Christian theme, but I am not Christian, as such, and I still really enjoy the play.  Vickie was actually my favorite character, but all the characters are purposeful and enjoyable.",1381708800,,629,4.296610169491525

This is not something that I could watch with my kids and due to the content there are many freinds that I could not watch this with. I like the message of stronger women. Although this is geared toward specific ethnicities, I believe that the messages Tyler Perry is sending don't necessarily need to be race specific but are very gender specific. This was also a homework assignment but I wouldn't mind watching it as entertainment either.",1357776000,,489,4.6976744186046515

It was funny, but it has elements of pride in it about black people, that shows the value system and familial relationships that are tribal and beautiful.  The scenes about the elders were breathtaking. They brought the women elders, grandmothers and great grandmothers into the circle at the family reuntion.  Cecily Tyson and Maya Angelou added so much.  I am pleased to recommend this movie, and you will be delightfully surprised, as we were.  Your children should definitely watch it because we aren't aren't paying attention to our elders or doing things that include ""Ceremony"" to welcome our sacred children into our families.",1151971200,,895,4.900662251655629

All the elements were there, we could have had some domino slapping and trash talking but we saw enough to know all the other things that were going on. Madea is a little over the top because she is all the memmories of the women that kept us on the straight and narrow. As far as the grits were concerned ask Al Green. My suggestion is to watch the movie with an open mind and an open heart. Feel the pain, experience the love and keep on keepin on. Also, if you had been paying attention the ""old fart"" was Madea's brother not her husband there's no man that could keep up with her. You might want to check out Tyler Perry's history and his plays and you would see that Madea is much more than a dress and attitude.",1141516800,3,805,4.166666666666667
2058639,4,B00023GFUY,"Medea returns in the latest of Tyler Perry's ""dramadies"", ""Medea's Family Reunion"".  The film is a hilarious combination of slapstick comedy and serious social commentary. Domestic abuse is one of the storylines in the films.  Within this storyline, viewers are introduced to some of Medea's kin people who have paid the ultimate price to elevate their social and economic status.  In an effort to provide her kids with the plush comforts of life, Medea's niece sacrifices the love of a daughter and the connection to her extended family.  The downcast daughter internalizes the mistreatment from her mother and develops a protective shield around her heart that nearly causes her the love of the one man who could truly make a difference in her life.  The mistreated and downcast daughter plays opposite of her dearly loved and pampered sister.  Having received all of the material things in life that she's ever wanted, the pampered sister is engaged to a wealthy investment banker who insists on control and domination at all times.  Both sisters survive their past and present with the advice and direction of Medea whose old school approach to love and family always pulls everyone together.

This comedy/drama is an extremely enjoyable escape.  The film is packed with high profile stars including Maya Angelou and Cicley Tyson and graced with some of the most popular (and sexy) African American movie stars at work today.  The films culminates at the family reunion where the elders, appalled by the lifestyle and behaviors of the family's youth, dispense the wisdom and guidance that will hopefully put the family back on course.  Typical of Perry's works, the films spoofs well known African American films and figures.  Didactic and often preachy, the film is quite entertaining and reflects, in jest, many serious issues affecting American culture in general and African Americans in particular.  Well worth the viewing.  Enjoy!",1141516800,5,1940,5.156549520766773
2058640,3,B00023GFUY,"I didn't enjoy this movie as much as I thought I would although it has to perform a difficult task by balancing domestic violence,black pride and faith with scatological humor.  You have to hand it to Tyler Perry though; he is remarkably talented, so much though that I think he bites off more than he can chew sometimes.  Madea may be judicious in her use of violence, but not everybody is in the real world. Her approach is funny but it would land her in jail nowadays.  What you love about Madea is that she ""just doesn't care."" The way the sister broke her engagement at the end would also probably land her in jail... but we all vicariously enjoy the justice of it all. All in all it was over the top, but the actors are great to look at, and it was fun to see Maya Angelou in the film.",1141171200,3,791,4.190789473684211
