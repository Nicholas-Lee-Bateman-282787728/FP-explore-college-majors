6160589,4,B00HETMEZE,I hadn't seen those cartoons in decades. It played well with no defects on my players.  I think my nephews will love it.,1398816000,,120,4.217391304347826
6160590,5,B00HETMEZE,Brings back a lot of good memories from when I was a kid and getting up early to watch my favorite heroes. Filmation really made Saturdays a kid's best friend. Would definitely buy again.,1395532800,2,187,4.529411764705882
6160591,4,B00HETMEZE,"As a comic book aficionado I love anything that is related to it.`I do not remember seeing any animation with The Atom, great",1392768000,,125,4.478260869565218
6160592,2,B00HETMEZE,"Nothing against the shows/episodes showcased.  The show is great stuff for it's time.  Truly fun nostalgia trip for those that want to watch.
BUT!!!  You're only getting half of the show!

Buy the other release ""DC Super Heroes: The Filmation Adventures"" with the YELLOW (not blue) cover.
Here's a link on Amazon:

It's the complete series for about the same price.",1390867200,40,541,7.661290322580645
6160593,1,B00HETMEZE,"This pretty much has episodes that all ready been put out on DVd. if you look at the back cover on Amazon you will find that it has the Flash, the Atom, and Green Lantern shorts by filmation.
that is it contains the following stories.
The Flash- The Chemo Creature, Take A Giant Step, To Catch a Blue Bolt
The Atom- Invasion of the Beetle People, The Planet Master, House of Doom
Green Lantern- Evil is as Evil Does, The Vanishing World, Sirena, The Empress of Evil

Now I have no issue with these toons. they are good fun. classic Silver age stuff. Flash and Kid Flash facing various threats. Featuring the Blue Bolt a villian who moves as fast as the Flash and was never seen in comics. The Atom fighting evil. GL aids the Guardians of the Galaxy. with him is his tool man, Kairo, a boy from Venus (a more PC version of GL""s Eskimo friend in the comics). Making a toon debut is Evil Star.
these toons are what they are just for fun. they were shorts shown in the Superman Aquaman hour.

It is stated this is Volume One. it is possible that the Second Volume will have the Hawkman, Teen Titans, and JLA shorts which have already been collected.

Me I say save your money. get instead -DC Super Heroes: The Filmation Adventures (2008)-
That has all the shorts all in one DVD, if you can get it for a good price.
In other words that DVD has the Flash, GL, Hawkman, Atom, TT, and JLA shorts all in ONE DVD.

I have to say I am a bit disapointed in this release since it is a rehash of whats come before.

I am pleased to see that the other Filmation stuff will be out soon. we will get the more Superman and Batman toons soon.

A few final notes. this 'vent' is more as a disapointment in the studio and a word of warning to future buyers. it would be better for a person to get the full set rather than waste their money on something that is not complete.

also everyone makes mistakes. spelling is not my strong point. please no more comments about that thanks.",1390694400,26,1961,4.2272727272727275
6160594,3,B00HETMEZE,"I'm not going to judge yet, however, this seems like a re-release of this:

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/B0018BDDFE/dp/B0018BDDFE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">B0018BDDFE</a>

I guess its ok because it is more of a budget release, however with Filmations Superboy, still unreleased DC/WB should focus on getting these out first rather than starting on re-releases. These are the only ones that haven't been released yet. Common WB, complete our colections and make us happy.",1389312000,12,512,6.514705882352941

8632092,3,B00HETMEZE,"First of all, the DVD has 9 cartoons - three each of The Atom, The Flash, and Green Lantern, each only 7 minutes long, and are some of the earliest cartoons using DC Comics' characters. The cartoons here are only 7 minutes long each, and were broadcast as part of ""the Superman-Aquaman Hour of Adventure"" in the late 1960's on CBS. That show expanded CBS' weekly ""Superman"" series (which had two Superman cartoons with a Superboy cartoon sandwiched between them), by adding 2 Aquaman cartoons per program, and shorts featuring other heroes - including the 9 cartoons here.
The stories are simple, low on violence, and only one features a villain from DC Comics (GL's enemy, Evil Star). The animation is  basic, and costumes are simplified (such as Flash's wrist lightning bolts becoming yellow gloves).
TV TRIVIA - actor Ted Knight, who is the narrator and voices many characters, became an Emmy winner for playing TV anchorman Ted Baxter on the 70's super-hit, ""The Mary Tyler Moore Show.""",1483833600,,990,4.892857142857143

8632098,4,B00HETMEZE,"In the DC Comics universe,there have many versions of these charecters over the decades past,,and no where else is so evident,then what has originated from that now defunct area called Saturday morning TV! with Warner Bros. Entertainment,they've become THE largest library of Animation,,everything from the classic Warner Bros. cartoon shorts,to the vintage MGM cartoons,back in the day when that studio's animated representatives were a famous Cat & Mouse,,then there is the Hanna-Barbera library,along with other independent animated material-one such case,were some of the vintage Filmation Associates produced shows,mostly produced for CBS,which is where this particular DVD set comes from! previously released on DVD in 2008 by Warner Home Video,the collection of these DC Super Heroes originally aired as ""guest stars"" on CBS's ""THE SUPERMAN-AQUAMAN HOUR OF ADVENTURE"" from Fall 1967-and anyone who remotely remembers that particular Fall line-up
will recollect what a whole,fantastic experience that was for Baby Boomers,back when Saturday morning cartoons were mostly ""Super Hero"" related material,,and back then,when a young CBS program executive named Fred Silverman was calling the shots back in those days,he left no stone unturned-especially with CBS's Super Hero Saturday line-up,that made ABC and NBC's weekend line-up look inferior and pale-but the shows on the other two networks back then,were still pretty good-but CBS was still in the main lead,back in those days! the ""SUPER HEROES"" DVD release,isn't anything too special or different from the previous 2008 release-but back when these ""guest star"" shots were running on ""THE SUPERMAN-AQUAMAN HOUR OF ADVENTURE"",it actually would've been extremely great,if all these segments were shown under their original series' title,the way they made ""THE ALL NEW SUPERFRIENDS HOUR"" from Fall 1977,which was officially the second season of the ABC series-which incidently,was also released on DVD in 2008! would've been nostalgic and great,had Warners released
the 1967 CBS series under it's original title-but that was not the case! the Filmation produced cartoon shorts were of course,typical of that studio's then early and limited animation,which became a special milestone for Lou Scheimer,and his then partner,Norm Prescott,and their co-founder Hal Sutherland,may they all rest in peace-and from there,Filmation led the way,into an impressive TV history with it's cartoon shows,before withdrawing from Saturday morning TV after ""GILLIGAN'S PLANET for CBS in Fall 1982,but only to achieve a greater status,with the syndicated ""HE-MAN AND THE MASTERS OF THE UNIVERSE"" for then,new owner Group W/Westinghouse,and Mattel Toys-but when the studio had originally produced the DC Super Heroes in the 1960s,their success was astounding! there are many obvious flaws with the way
Filmation did the DC Heroes,,but the results were still impressive! in ""THE ATOM"" and ""TEEN TITANS"" shorts,look for the voice of Pat Harrington. Jr,who was also employed by Filmation Associates,when they did ""JOURNEY TO THE CENTER OF THE EARTH"" for ABC-as many of you know,he went on to play ""Schneider"" on CBS's ""ONE DAY AT A TIME"" (1975-84) and of course,the voice of Ted Knight,a few scant years before landing the ""Ted Baxter"" role on ""THE MARY TYLER MOORE SHOW"" in 1970,,all interesting little facts,despite some of the imperfections that DC Comics' fans may complain about,when viewing this DVD,,but remember,this was a special time,when people back then did things their way-and in Filmation's case,they managed to master great creativity in their limited animation,and turned that,into an impressive form of Artwork,as their animation began to improve and mature,with their ""TARZAN"" and ""FLASH GORDON"" TV series to testify
for their history-and the rest,as they say,is history! one name to also look for,when viewing the credits,is Allen Ducovny,who was the executive producer for all these DC/Filmation cartoons-he later created ""SPACE ACADEMY"",Filmation's live action series in Fall 1977,and had a history with CBS's Children's programs,in the mid 1970s. i seriously reccomend ""DC SUPER HEROES"" for only those viewers,who knew and appreciated Filmation's earlier works,back when the cartoon business was booming big in it's hey-day,and when they made Saturday morning TV a very special and fun place!",1455148800,,4347,5.689230769230769
