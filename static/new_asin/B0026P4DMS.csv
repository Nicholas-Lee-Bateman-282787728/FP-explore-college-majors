8353337,4,B0026P4DMS,"If you've purchased a Micro-BR, you need this DVD. It really is the user manual for this device. I knew the Micro-BR was rich in features, and I'd been using it for almost a year, but I hadn't even tried some of the features shown on this DVD. Well worth the money, and not the worst training DVD I've seen either. Done on a shoestring, you can tell, but not a shoestring from a cheap pair of shoes.",1300147200,,399,4.128205128205129
