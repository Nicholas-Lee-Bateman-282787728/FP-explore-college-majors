England does make some very fine movies .This movie starts out a bit slow, but picks up as it goes. Very interesting story good acting and a surprise at the end . The cover of the DVD in no way represents the movie inside.",1400112000,,309,4.0
8304819,4,B001GBNL2G,"I cannot begin to express how much I like this movie.  It is weird.  It is gritty.  It is medieval.  It is supernatural. Most of all, it is totally terrifying in all the right ways, and even in some of the wrong ways which feel so right.

Finding a copy of this movie which will play on U.S. DVD players is a challenge that I do not expect to ever overcome, but it is a delight on the computer screen.

A lot of the acting is over the top in all the right ways.  There are big dogs, a money that properly dies, and a whole lot of gross testicle shots.  If you're into sickening movies, this is probably the best.",1371686400,,612,4.0
