But what is it, exactly? Well, it's a compliation of music videos from various JumpStart games, as well as some songs from the two other JumpStart videos&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/JumpStart-Preschool-Who-Left-Their-Juice-on-the-Caboose/dp/B0006TO0L0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">JumpStart Preschool: Who Left Their Juice on the Caboose?</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/JumpStart-Kindergarten-Why-Did-the-Bus-Stop/dp/B0006LY1DA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">JumpStart Kindergarten: Why Did the Bus Stop?</a>. The videos are presented by DJ Frankie and are divided roughly into categories (though it's not very precise; one of the songs, the opening theme for JumpStart Numbers, is included in the Math section because that's what JumpStart Numbers teaches; however, the song itself is just goofy and fun and doesn't teach anything). It lasts about 30 minutes long, so it's a fair length.

Some of the songs are real hits, especially the ones from JumpStart Animal Adventures and JumpStart Artist. Others leave a little to be desired, such as the ""Furs, Feathers and Fins"" song. Others are pleasently annoying, such as the JumpStart ABC song. You'll love to memorize it and use it to annoy your siblings and parents!

But it's time to move on to a more practical standpoint: what purpose this video serves. And from what I can tell, it's essentially an advertisement for JumpStart and isn't super high budget. They didn't even add ""sing-along"" text to any of the songs, which seems like an obvious addition for a video of this nature. And it's a ""mixed bag"" when it comes to education; some songs are clearly educational while others don't really teach anything.

That being said, it's an entertaining watch, and if you like JumpStart games and/or are a young child, it is quite enjoyable. And I think there are a few specific situations in which this video could work quite nicely:

-Just like any other kids' video
-Background music - put it on low volume while doing a craft or chores or any other such
-A video to be played at a daycare or any sort of ""fun waiting room"" or place to go while Mommy is gone. This works especially well because it's the kind of video where it doesn't matter a whole lot if you miss a part. You can leave and/or jump in when you want.
-A tape to play in some sort of kids' shopping place (especially if it carries JumpStart products)

If your kid has plays JumpStart and/or any or all of the above situations are applicable for you, you may want to seriously consider this product - provided that you can get it for a good price.

Before I finish off this review, I'd like to rattle off all the products from which songs in this video originate:

NOTE: Many of the reviews I have written were written before I turned 13. Thus, to see them, you must search all reviews (there should be an option somewhere on the page) and use the search terms ""Gotta trust the kid's review!"" and ""StoryMaker"". Just remember that some of the reviews I wrote when I was little are a bit immature - I'm planning on updating some of them tho'.

Edit: Just to mention, a few songs in this have kind of a rock-'n'-roll or rap-ish sound to them, so if you don't want your kid to listen to that kind of music, I wouldn't recommend this.",1287792000,,5042,6.707503828483921
