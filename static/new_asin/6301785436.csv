364091,1,6301785436,"Alas, unknown to me, there were two TV movies with the same title  Buried Alive made in 1990. One had reasonably though not outstanding reviews. The other, this one,  had poor reviews and was deservedly a box office failure. I was especially disappointed because of the presence of that fine horror tale actor the late Donald Pleasence and the excellent actor Robert Vaughn. The movie was made  towards the end of Donald's life and maybe he was too hard up to reject the role. Why Vaughn accepted  a part in ths bomb is a mystery  as he is still very much alive and kicking and is playing at 78 years in a movie, The Magnificent Eleven that is  in preparation this year.",1312156800,,670,4.450819672131147
364092,3,6301785436,"As a fan of Robert Vaughan and Edgar Allen Poe since childhood, when I saw this new release and being unfamiliar with it (and not being able to find any info on IMDB at that time), I jumped on this one immediately. While not exactly experiencing 'buyers remorse', I have to admit I wasn't enthralled, though most fans of 80's slasher and horror will definitely see merits in this film lost on this reviewer, so take these statements with that in mind. I myself am not a big fan of 80's horror (possibly a flaw of mine).

Robert Vaughn is excellent and creepy as the headmaster and professor of this all girls school for delinquents, and keeps things moving along single-handedly. The odd thing here is that this film is almost a women-in-prison flick in nature, with all the accompanying clichs of the genre, (you know - lots of showers and a catfight or two) but with only a modicum of the required nudity inherent in that style of flick. Which is too bad, really, as it would have raised the bar considerably, especially when you consider that Ginger Lynn Allen (yes, that Ginger Lynn, the princess of early-mid 80's porno fame) is one of the bad girls in attendance. Though you will see some of the other lasses in various states of undress, you won't see her undraped anywhere... bummer.

The kill scenes are decent yet routine for 80's horror films, the girls disappear when they are unusually disobedient, but aren't buried alive, per se; they're walled in within the dark past secrets of the building's basement. No real scares here; we can see who the perpetrator of the crimes is half-way through the film, but the finale is decent nonetheless. Donald Pleasance is fine as the oddball teacher of dubious qualifications who's been at the facility longer than anyone. Like I said, these films are not hits with me, but are for a vast majority of horror fans, so use your own discretion after reading my review, and don't fault me if you don't agree - I prefaced my review accordingly.

A 3 star effort for my tastes, but probably 4 stars for most viewers. You decide. For Vaughan fans, it's a no-brainer.",1303862400,2,2111,4.624
364093,4,6301785436,"Robert Vaughn, Donald Pleasense, Karen Witter and John Carradine star in this classic tale of underground terror from the master of horror, Edgar Allan Poe.
The story is about an isolated school for troubled teenage girls which was once an asylum for the incurably insane. The school is run by the charistmatic psychiatrist, Gary Julian (Vaughn). . . Captivated by his charm, a young teacher joins the staff. Soon, she is driven to the edge of madness and the school's underground corridors... where a masked killer runs amok, his victims end up being buried alive!
Shot in atmospheric locations, eerie acting.",1033430400,9,610,5.0495049504950495

7815282,1,6301785436,"I wonder if I should even write a review for this movie since I never read the Edgar Allen Poe story it was based on & even if I did read the story I probably wouldn't get it since I never understand his stories anyway. If I did read the story, Would the movie have made more sense or would it have even made a difference? Since I watched it yesterday I guess I'll write a review. I'm glad I got to see this movie off the free channel because it's not a movie I would've paid to see or rent. This movie is only worth watching if you can see it for free. It's a good time waster if you're looking for a horror flick to watch. If you do watch Burried Alive then you'll understand why the movie was a flop, a sequel was never made & why you should not pay to watch it",1432080000,,764,3.872611464968153

7815285,3,6301785436,"The movie boasts a fine cast, with Robert Vaughn, Donald Pleasence, and John Carradine (in his final film appearance).  Playboy Playmate Karen Witter is very beautiful, and might make a passable supporting character.  However, she is not a good enough actress to play a teacher convincingly, not to mention being the main character in this film.  On the other hand, adult movie star Ginger Lynn Allen does a very good job of playing the rebellious student Debbie.  Robert Vaughn chews the scenery, Donald Pleasence looks and acts goofy, and poor John Carradine is in a wheelchair, and looking every bit as old as he was.  The story is only slightly connected to Edgar Allan Poe's writings at most.  The DVD has no theatrical trailer or bonus features of any kind.  All in all, it's a little disappointing, but watchable.",1402444800,3,820,4.856115107913669
7815286,2,6301785436,"Again Vaughn deserved better projects and this is one that could've
been good but isn't! He's good as always but the script and directing
just ruin the movie. I'm sure made to cash in on the slasher 80 films
but this one doesn't even make it as a good slasher movie.",1397952000,,266,4.235294117647059
