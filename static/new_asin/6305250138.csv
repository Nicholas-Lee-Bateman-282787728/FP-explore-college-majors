1001900,4,6305250138,"My 11 month old son loves this video.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that he really isn't all that interested in the little ""TV"" parts (where they show videos on the Tubby bellies).  But if any of the Teletubbies are in a scene it totally holds his attention.  He smiles and babbles at the baby ""sun.""",1043539200,,321,4.063492063492063
1001901,4,6305250138,"My daughter loves tele tubbies, so we bought the whole set.  Then we bought the video which keeps her consoled and sitting quietly when she watches.  All the antics you know tele tubbies for, tubby custard, noo noo, etc ... Lots of fun, useful if you have lots of house work to do and want to keep your kids watching something fun.",1004832000,,331,4.32258064516129

7886528,5,6305250138,"As a longtime teacher and new grandpa, I am totally sold on every episode of TELETUBBIES. The show is wonderfully planned and executed, keeping the child's constant interest and presenting beautifully simple and structured concepts. Lots of positive feedback, and my 1.5-year old granddaughter is a huge fan.
Repetition... in this case, of old favorite Nursery Rhymes, is indeed the Mother of Learning.  Get a copy of this VHS tape and if possible a DVD.
Any TELETUBBY is a great TELETUBB""Y.",1292630400,,491,5.061728395061729

I thought I'd never let him watch this show but, he really likes it & it really isn't that bad at all. It is educational....",1109030400,,302,4.033333333333333
7886530,5,6305250138,"Setting aside the controversy about the Teletubbies, this is a great video.
The Teletubbies are easy to like and have appeal to young children. My son enjoyed them until he was about two and a half and I find my daughter is moving on from their shows at about the same age.
They sing and dance and talk in simple terms. They play and enjoy life. In this video they concentrate on Nursery Rhymes while they sing and dance. The little skits are centered around nursery rhymes as well. This particular video is one of my favorites as well as a favorite of my children.
The segments are short which means you have a good stopping point at about 10 minute breaks. This helps control how much tv your children watch.
Enjoy.",1067299200,3,717,4.4393939393939394
7886531,5,6305250138,My 11 month old just started watching the Teletubbies a few weeks ago and she loves them.  This particular tape is very entertaining for her.  She absolutely loves the baby in the sun and mimics the sounds the baby makes.  I highly recommended this tape for babies her age and older.,1060819200,2,283,4.509803921568627
