8582217,3,B00CIWPJ9A,"Ok, Wolf; Bruckner: Lieder; Symphony 7 (Blu Ray) is the only one of 4 Bruckner 7 Blu-ray discs on the market. I owned 2 of them with a huge expectation of this one as BBC Music Magazine give this disc 5 stars. Rene Fleming ? Very good for the first 30 minutes of this concert. But the main course of the dinner is Bruckner 7, right ? I thought Franz Welser-Most always undercooks Bruckner a bit even though the overall performance is very good. But Thielemann underwhelms me. It is a smooth ride without enough firing power.",1430870400,,524,4.412371134020619
8582218,5,B00CIWPJ9A,"I really like the new classical music videos on Blu Ray, for the hi res 5.1 audio as well as the video.  The Unitel Classica series with Christian Tielemann are especially well recorded, filmed and performed (see also the complete Beethoven symphonies boxed set and Brahms symphonies boxed set).  Highly recommended.",1400889600,2,316,5.176470588235294
8582219,5,B00CIWPJ9A,"Christian Thielemann conducts Renee Fleming and the Staatskapelle Dresden in a program of five songs on Hugo Wolf, with the more familiar Befreit of Richard Strauss (said to be a personal favorite of Fleming and Thielemann). The concert then concludes with the Symphony No. 7 of the Dresden Staatskapelle signature composer, Anton Bruckner. The dvd, recorded at a live performance in September 2012, is a gem - Thielemann is superb, the orchestral tone and discipline is marvelous, and Fleming...Ah, she delights yet again. When she sings the rarely heard songs of Hugo Wolf, those acknowledged excellent compositions are given a first class presentation. Thielemann is skilled in coordinating the singer with a full and powerful orchestra, so her full emotional and dynamic range are clearly heard.",1381708800,6,799,5.349206349206349
