4466836,5,B004UC7HUK,I like these Dvds. They are are short and sweet and I get a great workout. They are all great. Ass and abs and Diesel are my favorite. I do them all the time and still feel it.,1328745600,3,176,3.6578947368421053
4466837,2,B004UC7HUK,"If you have any toning videos, there is no reason to rent or own this one. The moves and pacing are nothing you haven't seen before. Jillian Michaels 3-2-1 Workout, Prevention 3-2-1 or Crunch Total Sculpt are all more fun, and have better instructors. This one just tells you over and over that she lives in San Francisco and you're gonna look great in that tank top! The segments also seem out of order, starting with a butt and abs routine (squats and planks, shocker!), continuing to a weight training segment, and finishing with a cardio/weight interval segment. It seems to me that abs on the floor is an end of the workout activity. Get a better toning workout that is motivating, and makes more sense.",1319328000,7,708,4.626984126984127
4466838,5,B004UC7HUK,"I used to do this on exercise tv until Comcast did away with it.  Great variety on this video.  I love the ass and abs workout- good length, challenging but not killer like Jillian Michaels.  The chisel arms really works the upper arms.  Michelle makes it a little funky - so the workout is fun, not boring.",1376524800,,307,4.333333333333333
4466839,3,B004UC7HUK,"I like the butt workout a lot, and it's short but effective...I would recommend this.  The exercises are challenging, and she adds on nicely.  good workout",1376092800,,155,4.923076923076923
4466840,5,B004UC7HUK,"Did Ass & Abs using On Demand and when it was no longer available that way, I bought this dvd.  All 3 workouts are great and I can see a difference in my fitness level after only a couple of weeks.",1365724800,,197,3.8048780487804876
4466841,5,B004UC7HUK,Best workouts for the results you want! Alternative workouts would be needed if you want better results but it's great to keep you in shape!,1359936000,,140,4.64
4466842,5,B004UC7HUK,Great DVD I use it 5 days a week! I use it as a warm up and for days I want do just workout my upper body,1356048000,,105,2.925925925925926

4466845,5,B004UC7HUK,"I'm glad I bought this workout. I was doing this last year @ home on my cable provider but this year they removed it. So after having my 2nd son,(who helped quite a bit with getting back to my pregnancy size by the time he was 6weeks old )I still needed to toned up. The A and abs workout is awesome along with Chisel routine.  BUY IT!",1342224000,,335,4.0
4466846,5,B004UC7HUK,This is one of my favorite workout videos. The ass and abs workout really targets those hard to reach spots. The workouts are easy to follow and you feel great after doing them. The 20 minute segment is perfect for busy days. Some videos you need to do for an hour but these workouts make 20 minutes of exercise enough to get you in shape.,1338854400,,339,4.230769230769231
4466847,5,B004UC7HUK,"I love this DVD - I have only done Ass n Abs, not sure why I haven't tried the other ones, but I LOVE Ass n Abs! It is great for me as I work out in the morning and don't have much time - I get a quality 20 min workout and I can feel it working in both my  - yep, ass and abs! This is in the rotation at least 1-2 times per week. These are good old tried and true exercises, done just long enough to fatigue but then switch it up before you get bored. Love, love it!",1333929600,3,466,3.5242718446601944
8441392,5,B004UC7HUK,This is a great DVD.  She makes exercising fun.,1470441600,,47,4.222222222222222
8441393,5,B004UC7HUK,It really is fun easy and the more times in one day you do it.....the sooner results you see.,1465948800,,93,3.9473684210526314
8441394,5,B004UC7HUK,super fun made me loose weight,1417737600,,30,4.166666666666667
8441395,5,B004UC7HUK,"I love this DVD. I mainly do the Ass & Abs workout. I have read the reviews and wanted to touch on one of the points made about this being too basic. I would agree but that is the beauty of it in my opinion. For the beginner or one who hasn't worked out for awhile, you will be sore the next day, believe me.

You will know that it hits all the right places but you will also be able to follow along and get through the whole thing if not the first time, the time or two after that and from that point on the depth of the workout comes from you. Squat deeper, squeeze harder, etc.

I can blow through this thing doing everything perfectly and I do change things up and use other videos and HIIT routines but I put a heart rate monitor on and this routine still pushed my heart toward the outer range even when I was sure I was barely working so until such time as I can get through this and not raise my heart rate significantly then I don't think it's too easy so I put my all into it and it delivers. I do recover almost immediately afterward though. It's not that hard but that's a good thing sometimes.

Here are the many plus points to me:

- It's just 20 minutes but zooms by and feels like 10.
- It moves along at a good pace but is easy to follow.
- It's not boring.
- I like Michelle Opperman and the people with her are all upbeat and not at all obnoxious in my opinion -- only encouraging.
- If you can only get one workout in that day, this one at least gets the job done and is easy to confront.
- On a day where you are going flat out fitness, it's a great warm up to more heavy duty stuff.
- It gets enough results in a way that keeps you motivated to get more fit without exhausting and confusing you which pushes you towards quitting.
- It is what it is and that's okay.

Bottom line, my legs look great from doing this video and in fact, they're pretty rock hard. My ab muscles feel really hard, strong and I can tell that when I get that last layer of stubborn fat off (which is diet related), the work will show more than it does now. My diet and fat need to catch up to my muscle definition that lurks beneath the surface.

I highly recommend this DVD. Also, as an aside, I am not sure why this is not showing up as a verified purchase as I most certainly did buy it from Amazon.",1408752000,,2300,3.9675324675324677
8441396,5,B004UC7HUK,These workouts are so much fun!  All 3 of them leave you feeling great after a quick 20 minutes and they are fun that time goes  by quickly.  These are great if you are like me and don't always have more time to dedicate to working out.,1400716800,,236,3.978723404255319
8441397,5,B004UC7HUK,"This is a wonderful exercise DVD! It is fun and  works you out! Time flies by before you know...It done! You will definitely be able to feel it works the next day! (You my find it is a little hard to sit!)
I recommend it to anyone who has 20 to workout and have fun. It is great for any age level!
5 star product and seller!",1392854400,,324,3.8358208955223883

8441399,3,B004UC7HUK,"The instructor is up-beat and encouraging, but also slightly annoying. I definitely felt the burn, but I am not completely impressed. I would suggest these workouts for beginners.",1384732800,,179,5.428571428571429
8441400,5,B004UC7HUK,"Great workout.  Not too long, good lower body.  Was definitely sore next day.  All thigh muscles felt it and i do exercise on a regular basis.",1377561600,,142,4.384615384615385
8441401,5,B004UC7HUK,I did these workouts when they were on Exercise TV and I loved them.  I use them as workouts to do on my off days from running.  I love that I can get in a good workout and not have to spend a ton of time doing it.  They aren't difficult and you can make them more challenging by adding heavier weights.  I wish I had a Crunch gym where I lived because I would definitely be a member!,1376611200,,384,3.8227848101265822
