6114482,5,B00GUEROFO,"I first visited Pompeii in 1973, about 10 years after the dig came under governmental oversite and this was a wonderful journey back to those days. It is wonderful to see the progress they have made over the years. My only regret now is that I'll never be able to get to see it in person as it is now.
Great set full of information.",1397088000,2,332,4.123076923076923
6114483,5,B00GUEROFO,"I've always been fascinated with the story of Pompeii's destruction, so I went for this DVD, and it's a good one--3 movies packed onto one DVD, one of them talking about the very real possibility of another catastrophe, since Vesuvius is far from dead, and the huge city of Naples is right at its foot.  The other movies are also good, and this is an excellent (if frightening) video.",1396828800,,384,4.565217391304348

6114493,5,B00GUEROFO,"History is very much of interest to me as try to become more acquainted with pieces of history that I am not familiar.  It seems as time passes, what I have learned in the past has become fuzzy.  I like having references that I can restore sections of history that I should have remembered from my time in school.

8627613,5,B00GUEROFO,"You can skip the first part with the ""Oh so full of himself"" wannabe Indiana Jones.  He adds nothing, from the second part on, it was very good.  I bought this for a friend but watched it so I could be sure it was what I wanted to give to my friend who'd never been to Pompeii.  I have been twice.  I wish they had shown more of the houses and frescoes.  Still, it was good!",1423872000,2,374,3.8684210526315788
