8483840,1,B005QW5CK0,I purchased this dvd to help my son learn Spanish. He takes Spanish at school but wasn't getting the hang of it. I found this dvd to be very hard. The words are on the screen but they do not say the word in English and some of the pictures are not clear. For example pieces of fruit were just a round circle that could be several types of fruit. How can I teach them which it is if I'm unsure myself? This dvd did not meet expectations as it shows on commercials.,1373241600,,463,3.989247311827957
8483841,3,B005QW5CK0,"This is really more appropriate for older kids (maybe 4+). My daughter isn't really interested, but she's also only eighteen months.",1366156800,,132,5.333333333333333
8483842,4,B005QW5CK0,The item was for my great-granson so I am awaiting results on his  learning the material but I would recomend it to others,1357948800,,122,4.304347826086956
8483843,2,B005QW5CK0,"My kids are 4 & 5 and know Spanish. I thought this would really help with context and all that jazz. They are just not into it. The computer portion that comes with it does not work properly and it does not install on the computer. You must use the cd each time. SInce it does not automatically run through lessons it sucks. I heard this was the best brand too. Oh well, back to books and the basics.",1355184000,2,400,4.075949367088608
8483844,4,B005QW5CK0,"I grew up watching muzzy in Spanish class and always loved it.  So I was excited to buy Thames for my kids, maybe a little too excited because I think they are a little too young still but hopefully they will be using them soon.",1352937600,3,228,4.066666666666666
8483845,1,B005QW5CK0,"I got this DVD for the kids to start learning Spanish.  I may as well have just invested in some Dora DVD's, since the DVD only showed the kids pictures and said the names of the items in Spanish.  I don't call that immersion, and it was VERY boring for the kids.  Anyone who has or knows kids knows that they learn best when they are being stimulated and entertained. This definitely is not stimulating or entertaining.  If this is what the whole Muzzy system is like, I'm glad I found out now, instead of spending the ridiculous amount of money that they charge for the full program.  I'll be looking for another program.",1349308800,8,623,4.4298245614035086
8483846,3,B005QW5CK0,I was hoping there would be The Weiss on the screen as they were spoken but aside from that its a cute show. We only watched it once so far but my boys 8 & 3 have already been repeating a couple of things.,1349136000,,205,3.6818181818181817
8483847,5,B005QW5CK0,I had this a while ago for my two older kids and they loved it.  I now have it for my two younger ones and it's a great DVD for learning Spanish.,1326758400,4,145,3.53125
