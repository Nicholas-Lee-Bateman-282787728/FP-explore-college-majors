638119,3,6303366570,"Buster Keaton does well here, but the movie lacks the sense of adventure and fun his better works. Still an important addition to any proper Keaton collection.",996624000,,159,4.925925925925926
638120,2,6303366570,"While this VHS format of ""College"" may be considered a ""Hollywood  Classics Collector Edition"" by some critics, it is  certainly that, and something else; irritating to watch.
The story and  the acting aside, the main problem is the substandard transfer from film to  video.  The result is a poor quality picture with loss of detail, poor  focus, and exaggerated and disturbing contrasts of black and white.  This  is due, no doubt, to the poor decision by someone to transfer the video  using the slowest speed possible of EP/SLP.  The low cost of this video  reflects it's inferior picture quality.  The video may have been of better  quality if recorded on the standard speed (SP).
The secondary problem is  the ridiculous sound track which has been added to the video with  absolutely no regard for the story or the action.  It is merely  ""elevator music"" and would better have been used in a circus.  In  addition, the style of the music is not of the same era as the story, and  therefore doesn't match.
The movie itself, although not the best of  Keaton's, is entertaining and worth having in your ""Muster,  Buster"" video library.  Just not this taped version!  The poor quality  of this video interfers greatly with the enjoyment of the comedy - at least  for this viewer.
There has to be a ""College"" out there with a  far better image.",967680000,10,1344,4.705627705627705
638121,5,6303366570,"The following review applies to the Kino VHS/DVD version that includes 3 Buster shorts as well as the main feature, ""College"".
COLLEGE (1927):  Bus stars as the valedictorian of his high school who goes to  college to exceed in athletics in order to impress the girl he's in love  with.  It's fun to watch him fail in all aspects of sports that the college  offers, but I think he went too far to make himself look ridiculous at  playing the game of baseball, which in reality he happened to be very  talented at.  What's more funny are the scenes of the jobs he gets while  working his way through college.  The interior of the soda  fountain/drugstore he works at would make a 21st century antique dealer  drool.  He also tries his hand working as a black waiter and intentionally  looks as bad in minstrel makeup as Al Jolson did.
THE ELECTRIC HOUSE  (1922):  The Electric House involves his interest in gadgets.  Buster is  hired erroneously to electrify the house of a family who's away on  vacation.  Not wanting to refuse the job, he (incredibly!) finds out about  and installs electrical gadgets in the house from a learner's manual - all  this in the time span of an average vacation period (!).  The gadgets are  really clever though, including a moving stairway, which Buster actually  broke his leg on and caused him to stop shooting The Electric House until  the cast came off.  The filmed exteriors of the house were actually of  Buster's own home (it's neat-o!).
HARD LUCK (1921):  This gag-infested  short stars Buster as a loser who repeatedly tries to commit suicide and  bungles each time. One gag shows him drink out of some guy's bottle marked  ""poison"", dramatically fake a death act, then realize he drank  bootleg hootch, and goes back for more.  This was Buster's favorite short  because it included his favorite gag.  Unfortunately, we'll never see the  gag because the scene's been lost forever, despite gallant searches by film  historians worldwide to find it.  The scene is about Buster crashing  through the hole of a swimming pool and coming out of it years later with a  Chinese wife and kids.  Even without that scene, Hard Luck is pretty good.  This version had to be compiled from prints that were located from around  the world.  I could tell that at least one scene was found somewhere in the  United Kingdom because the word ""organization"" on a title card  was spelled ""organisation"".
THE BLACKSMITH (1922):  Bus and his  perennial heavy Joe Roberts work at a blacksmith shop. Joe plays his boss.  . .a meany boss.  Unlike the rest of us, I don't understand how Buster  could've related to the mean boss concept since, up until 1928 (at the age  of 32) when he got a ""factory"" job at MGM and started working  under the tyrant L.B. Mayer, Buster's real-life bosses (except for the  ""stripes"" that cluttered his World War 1 experience) were either  family or friends (I'm getting jealous) but he does pull it off.  The  Blacksmith is a fun short with lots of good gags. A scene where Bus  clumsily destroys a white Rolls Royce really makes you squirm and nervous.",957916800,3,3100,4.696629213483146
638122,4,6303366570,"For some reason College provokes the most extreme reaction of any Keaton film-- I've seen it called both his best and his worst by critics.  It is undoubtedly a lightweight work, and marred by some racial stereotyping, but  the main setpieces, in which Buster runs through gags on all the major  collegiate athletic activities, show off his physical dexterity at its best  and are as close to pure Keaton as it comes.  (The idea of him playing a  weakling is pretty quickly belied by the sight of his muscles in athletic  clothes.)  The tape includes three shorts that also fall pretty much in the  middle of the pack, although Hard Luck is worth noting both as one of the  last lost Keaton films to be rediscovered and as one of the blacker  comedies he ever did.",922233600,6,764,4.544117647058823
638175,5,6303366570,"College may not be Keaton's best, but it's still Keaton AT his best, if that makes any sense.  The story is very simple and is clearly just there to hang gags on.  But what gags!  Many of them are sports gags (baseball, track and field, etc.) and Buster was clearly having a great time with them.  The Blu-ray looks very good and is noticeably better than the DVD though it's not as nice as The General or some other silents out there.  Given how old the film is, and the overall history of Hollywood and its film prints, it's understandable.  But College has never looked as good as this on home video, and I have it in every incarnation all the way back to a VHS bootleg in the late 80's.  I wish there was an alternate score with organ.  I don't know why, but I prefer Keaton with organ scores.  Maybe it's from seeing his films so many times in Los Angeles at the Silent Theater in the 90's with organ accompaniment.  Still, this disc is highly recommended.",1371254400,,961,4.318435754189944
638176,5,6303366570,"For those who are not familiar with the name Buster Keaton, it is sufficient to say that, along with Charlie Chaplin and Harold Lloyd, he was one of cinema's early and most famous masters of comedy. Joseph Frank ""Buster"" Keaton (1895-1966) made his mark in silent movies, as an actor, director, writer and director, and was able to carry on successfully to the talkies. One is his best and most memorable - a classic -- film is, without a doubt, ""College,"" now available in the glorious Blu-ray format thanks to Kino.

The story of ""College"" is quite simple and straight, yet humorous thanks to Keaton's physical comedy. He stars as ""a son,"" who just graduated with honors from high school. However, he is not admired by his classmates. That privilege, of course, belongs to ""a rival"" (Harold Goodwin), who is the athletic star. At the same time, Keaton is also attracted to ""the girl"" (Anne Cornwall); she likes him, but is kind of undecided. Soon after, all of them attend Clayton College, where Keaton decides to get into sports, so that he could win the girl's heart for good. Or, as he tells the school dean, ""I took up athletics because the girl I love thinks I am a weakling."" He tries everything - baseball, football, track and field... Because of this, his grades take a plunge, and the dean, who really likes him, tries to help him and find a solution.

One of the things that I enjoy about watching Keaton's films, in addition to the humor, is the locations. Many of them are still around today, and one of the extras in the Blu-ray is, precisely, a visual essay of the film's locations by John Bengston. There are also audio commentaries by film historians, as well as ""The Scribe,"" a 30 min 1966 film believed to be Keaton's - ""Great Stone Face,"" as he was nicknamed --last filmed performance. Quite a Blu-ray, as you can see - one for collectors. ""College"" can also be obtained in Kinos's fantastic collection ""The Art of Buster Keaton,"" available both in DVD and Blu-ray. (USA, 1927, B&W, 64 min plus additional materials)

638177,4,6303366570,"The first part of the movie got a bit bogged down.

I think he spent too much time with the attempts at the different track and field events.  The idea of course was to show him humorously failing at these events as he tries to impress the woman he loves.  In my opinion, he could have spent half the time on this portion of the movie and still gotten the point across...he was hopeless at sports.  It went from being funny to boring as time went on.

BUT!

The second part of the movie I thought was great.  I won't give it away, but the action picks up until a great climax that makes the movie worth the watch.",1367539200,,613,4.100840336134453
638178,4,6303366570,"Comparing this new Blu-ray release to the old Art Of Buster Keaton DVD shows much improvement.

1) A significant amount of picture has been added to all sides! The old DVD was heavily cropped on all sides!  But this added picture comes with some downsides, there was a framing problem in the master film and at times there is a lighter grey-tone bar at the bottom of the picture. This was cropped off in the old DVD.

2) The new High Definition transfer is sharper and does add details to the grass on the ground and the ivy on the buildings. Even the grainy replacement section at 24:51 looks way better here.

3) The old DVD was a little too bright, some of the whites seemed to wash out.  This new transfer lowers the white levels to correct this. However it gives the film the look of being shot on a cloudy day. Some may like the brighter look of the old DVD, others will like this less washed-out presentation.  I prefer this version, but find the old DVD acceptable.

4) Image stabilization has been used in this new transfer. The most noticeable improvement is in the opening titles, they are rock steady (but not a freeze frame).

5) The original DVD had some of it's dialogue cards replaced with black background cards. Here in this new transfer, all dialogue cards have the same curtain background.  They look original, not recreations.

The downside: Soms shots are still soft here and there as inferior prints had to be used where footage was missing fromt he original 35mm master.  But that is the nature of watching old films originally filmed on Nitrate film.

This 1hour and 5 minute film has the same John Muri musical accompanyment as the old DVD, but it sounds crisper here.
There is also an optional COMMENTARY TRACK by Slapsticon founder and film historian ROB FARR.

BONUS MATERIAL:
The old DVD included Buster's shorts that are now on the Buster Keaton Shorts Blu-ray, but no real bonuses.
This Blu-ray has two bonus features:

a) Silent Echos (9:55) a then & now look at the shooting locations of ""College"".

b) The Scribe (29:25) a 1966 Construction Safety Associates of Onterio COLOR industrial film starring Buster.  This would be Buster's last appearance on film before he passed away.
Buster is a new reporter who visits a construction site to report on construction accidents. However the biggest cause of accidents on this site is Buster himself.
Buster doesn't speak in this sound film, he only points to a list of safety regulations and a narrator recites the regulation.  This pantomime separates him from reality and makes it easier to watch this now elderly man get bounced around.  This late example of Buster's work is a good indication on how the world sadly ignored this talented man since the 1940's.

AS FOR THE FEATURE FILM, College has never been one of my favorites.  Buster is attending college (which was a new concept in Los Angeles in those days as their universities were just being built).  After giving a speech on how important studies are over athletics, Buster's girlfriend tells him he must re-think his ideas if she is going to stay with him.  So Buster enters that athletic world (in real life Buster is an athlete).  Buster's thrill of athletics is apparent here, but 15 minutes of him blundering around on the Track & Field Stadium doesn't make good cinema.  This happens right in the middle of the film, it feels like the pace grinds to a halt.  We smile at his blunders, but they are not genuinely funny. The film picks up again and Buster is in top form during the boat race finale.
***PC WARNING*** Buster does apply for a job asking for ""Colored Waiters"" and goes in black-face for the job.

Any Buster Keaton film is still enjoyable, and if you are thinking of upgrading to this Blu-ray, I would suggest it",1361318400,8,3773,4.653092006033183

638180,4,6303366570,"In COLLEGE (1927), Buster Keaton portrays an anti-athletics bookworm named Ronald who, for love's sake, adopts a totally different philosophy.

To try to win Mary's affections, Ronald enrolls in college, where he hopes to become an athlete.

638183,5,6303366570,"Because all the reviewers that have written about "" College "" here before have done the job this doesn't want to be a review of my own. The lines that comes next are a translation to english of an excerpt from a review  that the surrealist spanish filmmaker Luis Buuel wrote in 1927 about this movie. For everyone who hasn't read it, here comes:

"" Here's Buster Keaton with his most recent film, the splendid "" College "". Asepsis. Disinfection. Freed from tradition our gaze revels in the youthful, tempered world of Buster, the great specialist in fighting sentimental infection of all types. The movie is beautiful as a bathroom, as vital as an Hispano-Suiza ( ... ) In Buster the expression is modest as the expression of a bottle. But in the circular rink of his pupils plays his aseptic soul:  the bottle and Buster's face have infinite points of view. They are things that must to fulfil its mission in the rhythmic and architectonic gear of the film. The montage - gold key of the movie - comments and unites all these elements. ""

Kino's DVD edition of "" College "" also contains Keaton's silent shorts "" The electric house ""; "" The blacksmith "" and  "" Bad luck "".",1156464000,,1172,4.509433962264151

He's finally assigned to the crew team as its coxswain, wins the big race with his ingenuity, and then rescues his girlfriend from a kidnapper by employing all the athletic skills he couldn't muster on the field.

Actually the whole picture is just a series of sporting ineptness sight gags, predictable and fairly obvious, but made marvelous by Keaton's tremendous talent: he makes them very funny to watch. An indication of their greatness is the fact that so many of the routines have been used again and again by others in Hollywood. Silent. Worth a watch.",1113609600,5,767,4.7669172932330826

7845349,4,6303366570,"The new Blu-Ray version of ""College"" from Kino will please any Buster Keaton fan and most others too. The story finds Buster as a smart high school grad with difficulties fitting in with the popular crowd. He follows his sweetheart to college and has to compete with the ""big man on campus"" for the attention of his high school sweetheart, the very attractive Anne Cornwall. Buster's attempts to fit in at college and with the popular crowd are thwarted in some very funny ways. Buster tries to hold a job as a ""soda- jerk"" at the local ice cream parlor but fails in funny fashion. Later he tries to impress the girl by being a college baseball player but fails at that too. Then it's on to track and field where he tries to emulate other teammates in all the events of the day(1920's). These include some field events that are no longer used. All of this leads to some very funny bits and eventual failure. He finally becomes the hero of the day as the coxwain for the rowing crew.  Of course he finally defeats his rival, wins the hand of his beloved and all ends happily.
Many of the college scenes were shot on the campus of the Univ.of Southern California and in the Los Angeles Memorial
Coleseum built for the Olympics. Over-all a very funny film.
 The only down-side is the unfortunate use of some ""black-face"" comedy scenes in which Buster tries to work in a restaurant as a waiter with disasterous results.
The disc includes a nice addition of John Bengtson's ""Silent Echoes"" in which he traces Buster's actual locations in the film through historical photos he has researched.
The disc also includes a short film that is believed to be Keation's last filmed performance. It's an industrial film promoting saftey at construction sites. It's a sad end to a remarkable career as one of film's greatest comic actors.
On the down-side, I could not get the disc's audio comentary by Rob Farr to operate. It may be a problem with the disc that I will investigate further. The musical setting by John Muri, though-out the film, was adequate.
Over-all, I give it four-stars.",1371427200,3,2075,4.635869565217392
