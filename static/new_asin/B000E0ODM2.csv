8103234,5,B000E0ODM2,Same comments as above for volume two. You can't say much more about this ingenious pair. Money well spent. And it's all clean so the whole family can watch and enjoy.,1357776000,2,167,4.419354838709677
8103235,3,B000E0ODM2,If your a fan of Dean and Jerry or  of early televsion you'll overlook the rather dated vaudville entertainment and grainy kinescope quality and enjoy this. You get to glimpse what Dean and Jerry's stage act was like and what live TV was like in these early post-war years.,1356652800,2,273,4.571428571428571
8103236,5,B000E0ODM2,"This is a great find for old tv lovers. There are four episodes of the show.
Ep. 1 Burt Lancaster is the guest. The skit where they count the feet is so funny.
Ep. 2 The menu says Jimmy Durante and Tony Curtis. In the episode M & L are doing talk of the colgate town (a parody of the ed sullivan show) and Jimmy Durante is sitting beside Cary Grant (really Dean Martin). Janet Leigh is beside Groucho Marx. this would have been when she was married to Tony Curtis. George Raft is sitting beside Clark Gable. Then Tony Curtis is sitting beside Big Ben the golfer.
Ep. 3 Marilyn Maxwell is the guest. The skit of Frankie and Johnny is great. I love Jerry's suit.
Ep. 4 had Rosemary Clooney singing.

This is a great DVD. It came on time and in great condition.",1343952000,5,758,4.191780821917808
8103237,5,B000E0ODM2,I didn't even realize these Martin & Lewis Comedy Hour shows existed! My family including my two teens love this DVD and Vol 2 as well. I'm so glad I discovered these on Amazon.com,1319500800,,180,4.323529411764706
