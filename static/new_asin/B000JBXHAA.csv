8149767,3,B000JBXHAA,"MUMBAI SE AAYA MERA DOST starts out as a comedy, gradually becomes more dramatic, and then somehow ends up in the action/adventure genre. Folks who've never seen a Bollywood feature before might be in for a surprise as the movie length and the cliched plot convolutions will give cause to some bewildered headshaking. Of course, if you've seen Bollywood films before, this one, more or less, is par for the course. MUMBAI SE AAYA MERA DOST tells of the return of a modernized native son to his humble village of origin and the resulting changes that are wrought. The movie stars two attractive leads in Abhishek Bachchan and Lara Dutta. MUMBAI... is also an unsubtle commentary on the all-consuming power the media has over the masses (in this instance, the media in the form of television).

After ten years spent in metropolitan Mumbai, Kanji (Abhishek Bachchan) visits his backwards, little hamlet which has very recently received electricity. He brings a gift for his grandfather and for the provincial village folks in the shape of a television set equipped with a satellite dish. This present immediately arouses curiousity and wonder in everyone as most of the villagers have never even seen a television before. Kanji's wise grandfather cautions Kanji that his gift might have negative repercussions on the community, and he's not wrong. The television's addictive allure soon results in day-to-day work being shirked and the local priesthood being ignored as the rustic locals become enamoured with the new images and ideas emanating from the set. Meanwhile, the forsaken priest, fearful for his livelihood (now he's not getting enough financial offerings from the villagers), protests to the villagers' thuggish landlord.

MUMBAI SE AAYA MERA DOST sets a lamentably languid pace for much of the film and, in fact, I actually began getting that claustrophobic feeling, that sense of being stuck in a movie where nothing much seems to be happening. This is actually a half hour short film ballooned to a 2 and a half hour cinematic elephant. The film is intent on significantly showcasing the affects the television has on the locals, in particular on two villagers: one, a man who takes on the affectations of a tough cowboy, and the other, an impressionable yokel who begins to move and speak in slow motion after having seen it done on TV. It's interesting to note also that, as time went on, the television and its immediate surrounding area begin to resemble an altar. Gradually, the TV is lavishly decorated with more and yet more garlands of flowers until you can barely see the screen. Additionally, plates of food are placed in reverential proximity, seemingly as offerings to the television deity. As I've said, the message isn't exactly subtle.

Interspersed thru all the stuff concerning the television are scenes of Kanji romancing Kesi (Dutta), whose unsuspected (by Kanji) familial relationship becomes germane later on in the movie. It, in fact, provides the impetus for the movie's turning point from the comedy genre to that of grim action. Now, it's very possible that the two lead actors, Abhishek Bachchan and Lara Dutta, may not exactly be ugly people. They sizzle together in their courtship sequences (and, later, in the dramatic scenes) as they try to outdo each other in the sexy, smoldering look department. There's a reason Lara Dutta was Miss Universe back in 2000. This is Lara's second film and her physical charms and sweet charisma are undeniable. She may be the most glamorous looking village girl I've seen outside of Aishwarya Rai (that is, whenever Aish plays a village girl). To his detriment, Abhishek's character doesn't do a lot for much of the film other than make googly eyes at Lara's Kesi and, with his childhood friend, callously make fun of the eccentric, easily influenced villagers. Of course, the last half hour of the film finds Abhishek as intense as you'll ever see him as the comedy moments are flung aside in favor of ultra-serious, action-packed melodrama. I've seen several Bollywood films now, but I have to admit to some incredulity at the violent, over-the-top final 20 minutes or so.

The broad and mostly humorous slapstick in the movie's first half is generated mostly by the local characters, who have never before experienced a television and soon are easily seduced by its contents. Soon enough, the villagers are mimicking Asian chefs, cowboys, and even a Matrix-like fellow. The funniest character is the slow-motion man as, even in one musical number, he persists in seemingly wading thru molasses. I also had a momentary chuckle from the battle preparation music montage, which boasts the very brief scene of Kanji giving pointers on slingshot technique to a bunch of kids. Of course, odds are that that scene wasn't intended to be humorous and was, instead, supposed to underscore the gravity of the situation, that the villagers' plight was so grim that even the children must become involved in the upcoming fray. But I still chuckled.

The musical numbers? They were okay. I like the festival of colors number, but, of all the songs, I prefer ""Shahar Ka Jadoo,"" which has Kanji and Kesi debating the pros and cons of city life vs. village life (and someone actually wins this debate). All in all, MUMBAI SE AAYA MERA DOST is a peculiar comedy film with a jarring transition around three quarters of the way thru, which will either put people off or shake them out of their lethargy. It's somewhat worth watching for the presentation of a rural Indian culture and also for the pairing of Abhishek and Lara. The film's message about the hypnotic influence of television? That whole arc becomes so mired in over-the-top comedy and quirkiness that it ultimately undermines itself (I knew it was over when the TV showed Superman and Spidey flying together and holding hands). Message yawned off. Two and a half stars for this one. If you're a fan of Abhishek Bachchan or Lara Dutta, go ahead and give this one a try. If you haven't heard of either actors, skip this one.",1179187200,,6047,4.947834645669292
