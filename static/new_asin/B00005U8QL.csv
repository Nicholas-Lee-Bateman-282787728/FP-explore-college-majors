It's realy a sin you can't get this DVD in Germany (where I live) and many other countries. So nobody knows this phantastic work... All that hollywood trash you can get, but... whatever...",1136419200,12,377,5.283333333333333
1664932,5,B00005U8QL,"My favourite sequence in ""Maze"" is when Morrow runs on the streets, silence behind, and ""I was Brought To My Senses"" plays in the background...this is one of the most poignant depictions of despair, and despairing love between two people who shouldn't have any romantic feelings for each other, on film. The pace with which Maze runs in the scene, and the haunting beginning of the song, which is sung without any musical accompaniment till the fourth line, are in stark contrast, but that is exactly what makes this shot one of the finest moments on celluloid. It befits a film on a touching subject.",1097884800,6,601,4.733333333333333
1664933,5,B00005U8QL,"This film is very good. It really doesn't try to be very fast or furious, but instead really dedicates its content to some real life issues for once. It is like an indie film, since it deals with an issue not usually approached, so it will be probably loved or totally rejected by the individual viewer, depending on your particular interests. Worth renting at least.",1053734400,2,367,4.661538461538462
1664934,4,B00005U8QL,"There are many people-- too many, in fact,-- who live their entire lives on the ""outside looking in,"" to one degree or another, because the ""normal"" ones among us-- the ones who govern the great majority, or even the ones who just have a hand in formulating the criteria by which the parameters of our great ""Society"" are established-- deem it to be so, and have the wherewithal to effect their ends.  Indeed, there are those who probably prefer an ""outsider"" status, rather than succumbing to the tenets of what is essentially the wide spread hypocrisy so prevalent throughout our world today.  But it would be nice to at least give them that choice, which unfortunately, despite all the ""politically correct"" posturing that goes on and on around us daily, we do not.  Yet, ironically, often it is these denizens from beyond the mainstream that so enrich our lives with their thoughts, art, and by their mere presence amongst us.  ""Maze,"" written, directed by and starring Rob Morrow, is the story of one of these:  An artist, whom we discover early on is also a very caring person, who is nevertheless relegated to that outer rim because he suffers from Tourette's Syndrome.  He's different; he doesn't fit in; he's an embarrassment.  He's also a very accomplished artist who puts his pants on one leg at a time, just like the rest of us.  And-- like the rest of us-- he has very basic wants and needs, all the things that give definition to what he really is:  Human.  Just like the rest of us.
Lyle Maze (Morrow) is an established artist on the verge of a critical and financial breakthrough, but he lives a solitary existence, spending most of his time holed up in his loft, alone.  He has one good friend, Mike (Craig Sheffer), but stays to himself, attempting to avoid the ridicule and embarrassment, or just the unwanted attention elicited by the uncontrollable ""tics"" generated by the Tourettes.  Mike is a doctor and prescribes medication that may help, but Lyle fears it may stifle his creativity, as well, so he refuses to take it.  it affects his work though, too, as his sudden outbursts are too disconcerting for even those with whom he must work, as when a model he has hired to pose for him walks out, unnerved by his seemingly erratic behavior.
Then Mike makes a decision that ultimately becomes the catalyst for what becomes a significant emotional event in Lyle's life.  Mike, following an altruistic bent, signs on with a medical group and commits himself to months of work in a third world country.  It's an admirable pursuit, but to follow this particular dream, he must leave behind the woman he loves, Callie (Laura Linney).  And though Mike doesn't realize it, it is a very fragile time for Callie, and for their relationship.  As Mike prepares to leave, Callie, aware of Lyle's predicament with models, volunteers to pose for him.  Things become complicated, however, when Lyle suddenly begins to realize that he has feelings for Callie-- feelings he should not have in light of the fact that Mike is his best (only) friend.  Lyle is conscientious and sensitive to the issue, but as is always the case in matters of the heart, all bets are off.  And so, to his problems with Tourettes, Lyle must now add the inner conflict and guilt born of his (as yet unexpressed) feelings for Callie, as he seeks to resolve yet another of the curves that life seems determined to throw at him.
This movie marks the feature film debut of Morrow as a writer (along with Bradley White)/director, and it's one of those little gems that it's so gratifying to discover after sifting through all of the ""fools gold"" that Hollywood continues to pollute the stream with.  Morrow successfully taps into that vein of need that runs through the human condition, places it in a proper setting, measures the finger of his audience and sizes it accordingly.  And like a hand crafted item made with precision and an eye for detail, the result is a small, but invaluable treasure.  Morrow (probably best known for his work in the TV series ""Northern Exposure"") has an acute grasp of human nature, and his insights provide the basis for a thought provoking, emotionally involving sojourn through the landscape of the human condition.  Indeed, it is the humanity he finds in his characters that makes this film sing.  It is a sensitive presentation devoid of any overt sentimentality that would have rendered it maudlin; with a seemingly innate sense of the emotional boundaries within which he must stay to be effective, Morrow keeps his finger on the pulse of the story, makes the necessary adjustments and keeps the heartbeat steady.  And it works.
As Lyle, Morrow gives an extremely affecting performance; his ""tics"" are done to perfection, to the point of an irritating realism that so effectively gives you that sense of what it must be like to suffer such a malady, as well as offering some real insight into how it affects those who encounter someone with Tourettes, and how difficult it can be to respond appropriately.  Morrow's portrayal generates understanding and sympathy for the sufferer, while at the same time offers some vindication to those who simply cannot cope with it.  As a filmmaker, Morrow is to be complimented for offering up such a sensitive subject for the consideration of his audience, doing it objectively and without passing judgment on their response.
Laura Linney is terrific, too, as Callie, giving a performance that evokes the empathy of the viewer with her portrayal of a woman at an emotional crossroads in her life, who though beset with inner conflict finds the strength to overcome her troubles and decide for herself the direction her life will take.  It's the kind of memorable performance which, along with Morrow's, makes ""Maze"" an entertaining and satisfying cinematic experience.  It's the magic of the movies.",1029974400,34,5854,4.8308308308308305
1664935,4,B00005U8QL,"This was an original and extremely well acted film. Rob Morrow was genious in his portrayal of Lyle Maze, and artist with Tourretts syndrome who falls in love with his best friends girlfriend. This film took so many unexpected turns, and steared clear of all the cliches that we have been accustomed to with this genre. I originally picked up this film because Laura Linney tends to do really good independent films, who knew when I took it home that good ole Dr. Fleischman from Northern Exposure had so much talent in writing, directing and starring in this fantastic gem. I hope that he keeps up the good work and gives us many more movies with such wondful performances. I highly reccommend this film to anyone who wants to see something original with great acting.",1029024000,3,769,4.703703703703703
1664936,4,B00005U8QL,"This movie is a stand-out for several reasons, although I'll warn you straight out that it isn't an easy film to watch much of the time.
  I doubt you'll find many films which feature a person with Tourette's syndrome and obsessive-compulsive disorder. This one does and that may make some viewers uncomfortable, especially as they watch this man, an artist, grappling with everyday things we all take for granted, but having great difficulty. When he goes grocery shopping, his noises and odd movements upset people. When he feels compelled to touch someone's sleeve, with no bad intentions in mind, he gets yelled at.
  True, the actor doesn't really have Tourettes but he is convincing in the role. If this sounds unappealing to you, I urge you to reconsider. I found it a bit distracting at first but quickly became engaged by the story.
  Secondly, the movie focuses on art and artists and how difficult it can be to make one's way in the world as an artist who also struggles with a major disorder - Tourettes.
 To add complications to the plot, there is also Laura Linney, who is in love with the artist's brother, a man who doesn't have Tourettes but DOES have a desire to save the world and who often leaves for months at a time. Needless to say, this leaves Linney in the lurch, especialy since she is newly pregnant and hasn't yet told her lover,
 She is left with the other brother and this is where the film becomes truly interesting. He cares deeply for her and she learns to see beyond the numerous tics, strange sounds and other behavior he displays. As she spends more time with him, she poses for him (the only time I can recall seeing Linney nude on-screen), reveals her fears about the pregnancy. They start to fall in love...but I won't reveal more.
 A minor gem of a movie with real heart.",1023321600,20,1811,4.58204334365325

Both men are also excellent, both relationships are very telling and the choice is not an easy one. I will never forget this movie. I saw it when it first came out in the theatres and I woul dsee it again and again. It is brilliant. Rob Morrow is excellent and the whole plot is utterly believable, because the delicacy and subtetly of the acting makes it so. I would recommend this a million times.",1316304000,,545,4.405940594059406
1664962,4,B00005U8QL,"By the time Maze was over, I really can't believe it ended up being good.  It had a pretty nice twist and adorable ending which I thought was a great touch, so I had to give it a positive rating.  However, this movie definitely has some issues.

First of all, I'm going to be completely honest.  I feel it was totally wrong on the part of the movie writers to make fun of Tourette Syndrome the way they do in the film.

The storyline -as you will quickly discover- is about a man who has to deal with the daily struggles of Tourette Syndrome.  Now I personally don't know anybody who has this condition, but that doesn't matter.  It's a serious problem for those out there who *do* have it, and a struggle for the family members and friends too.

So for the viewers to have to see such a condition treated as some kind of comedic act is, well... REALLY darn pathetic.  A certain scene where a woman is giving birth, and another scene involving a wine splashing incident are the biggest offenders.  I won't reveal exactly what happens, but these two particular scenes (along with a few others) treat Tourette Syndrome as some kind of joke, and it's wrong.  Therefore, any attempt at humor completely fails.

Another problem with the movie is that the pacing is REALLY slow for a good portion of the first half.  Slow and quiet.  A man with Tourette Syndrome goes around meeting women either as friends or as girlfriends.  He eventually falls in love with this one woman, but much of the storytelling is too much like filler with hardly anything happening at all.  Certainly nothing worthy of movie material.

However the second half is a significant improvement, and really does a nice job with the romance and drama.  However the comedy segments are really offensive and disrespectful, as I mention above.  Keep this in mind.  Also keep in mind the nude scenes are... they show everything.  Not a big deal to some of us though :)",1299196800,,1929,4.549418604651163
1664963,4,B00005U8QL,"I am so pleased and happy I finally bought this DVD.  I had been
aware for some time that Rob Morrow created this little gem but had
been careless about ordering a copy

It's unusual and takes a look at a disease that can and very often
does destroy a person's life.  In this case, however, Morrow writes
the  afflicted person as a happy individual, well able to cope with the cards dealt him.

Rob Morrow stars in his own production as a successful artist
by the name of Maze. Although the movie was made in 2000, ten years ago, the movie ages well and stands the test of time.",1280880000,2,578,4.218181818181818
1664964,5,B00005U8QL,"This is a cute movie, about a man with Tourette syndrome.  Rob Morrow has a tough role, in playing someone with this affliction. I wish I could have contacted him, to ask how long it took him to learn the behavior.  He made the character sympathetic.  Laura Linney was fantastic, and whoa! was she fine (in her posing), but that's irrelevant.  Most actors, who would write, direct, and star in their own work would make it an exercise in ego, but Mr. Morrow manages to strike a good balance.  (Too bad Numb3rs which he was on was cancelled).  Nice movie.",1276473600,,554,4.49
1664965,5,B00005U8QL,"I just wanted to say that MAZE is one of my most favorite movies ever.  When I rented it from Blockbuster last year, I watched it and then sat through it a second time immediately.  Last night I watched it again streamed off the internet.  I'd known I loved it, but forgot how MUCH I do.  I had planned to only watch the first half since I had things to do, but ended up watched the entire movie again.  I'll be buying this for my own one day.

Anyway, Rob Morrow plays an artist with Tourette's Syndrome.  I'd love to write him a fan letter for his performance and script.  He is wonderful!  He plays Lyle Maze with perfection.  Movies and TV like to play the disabled in one of two ways.  Either they are pathetic and helpless, or they are super human!  Maze is a real person.  He's a gifted artist who struggles through with his Tourette's.  It's a pain in the butt but he loves his work and he just keeps going.

I'm not sure how realistic the jumping videocamera action is when they are trying to show us his viewpoint.  I suppose only a person with Tourette's could tell us that. But it's okay.  It adds to showing his distress and anxiety.

Anyway, this is a wonderful romantic movie.  The friendships between the three are believable.  The artwork is wonderful!  I loved the art and watching Maze at work.  I will be watching this movie again and again.

Rob Morrow, I always liked your work, but you did a great job with MAZE!",1264809600,4,1435,4.31203007518797
1664966,5,B00005U8QL,"I have to give this one five stars because my wife says she won't speak to me unless I do.  She claims this ia a fabulous love story.  I don't know about that!  When the movie begins, it's about a confused artist Lyle (Rob Morrow, with curly locks and a round, greasy face) who seems to be doing OK career-wise, represented by a major New York dealer and selling like crazy, he should be sitting on top of the world, and yet because he has Tourette's syndrome he's unhappy, and when it gets going the syndrome causes him to see things in a confused and yet dramatic way, like two lenses grinding against each other.

This and other optical values are supposedly inspired by the visual struggles of real life Tourettes patients.  Rob Morrow wrote, directed, produced and stars in the movie and gives it everything he got.  He has so many touching moments he creates mini-montages continually, in order I suppose to fit him into as many cute moues as possible.  I put my foot down at one scene where he is supposed to be a birth coach for Callie (Laura Linney), the woman he wants but can't have because 1) she's the girlfriend of his best friend and 2) because he's so alienated and weird.  This montage features a large rubber ball over which she is supposed to rub her stomach, rest her head, just roll around on, and other jump cut type glimpses, and then you see Lyle rolling around on it, caught up in the spirit of now the way I imagine Tourettes' syndrome, with its emphasis on sharp guttural moans and also obscenities in childhood, accustoms you to.  But what do I know about Tourettes?  My wife watched a video on You Tube, Twitch and Shout, the video Rob Morrow says inspired him to create the character of Lyle the successful artist.  And the movie had a guy with curly hair and a round greasy face who twitched and popped just like Morrow, but cuter.

Should Laura Linney (foxy in a red haircut she should have learned to love) stay with the man who made her pregnant, even though he, Mike (Craig Sheffer) has gone off to Burundi to join the Doctors without Borders organization?  Well, remember Beyond Borders with Clive Owen and Angelina Jolie protecting infants from landmines?  Well, Laura Linney and Rob Morrow are the schlubs they left behind, and this is their story.",1259107200,,2286,4.530413625304136

The censors and distributors rule Hollywood all female nudity is cut, airbrushed, edited or obscured; But to see the movie we have to endure a politically correct plot of a man with Tourret's Syndrome. It's annoying to see the tics, spasms and jerks of the lead character, once spoiling a nude scene by spattering paint over the nude model. The plot is of a handicapped man falling for his best friend's pregnant wife and his nude model; and his frustrations of inferiority, until he finally gets the girl after the child is born.",1191542400,16,810,5.540322580645161

7954487,4,B00005U8QL,"This is a poignant story about a sensitive and lonely young man, who is alienated because of his disability.  He has extraordinary talent, a giver in every sense, and he falls for his best friend's girl.  Holding back then unable to when the friend is away on a long mission (yes, the friend is selfish and doesn't appear to deserve such a wonderful woman), he fills the void that is left.  She understands and needs his friendship for many important reasons, so she takes what he has to give, well aware of what it is costing him.  In the best Indy tradition, the plot does not conform to feel-good nonsense.  Where the characters end up is very real, ambiguous, and fraught, but still with a beauty to it. The acting is absolutely first rate, particularly Morrow and Linney, the would-be couple.

The film spoke to me in a very personal way.  I fancied myself in love with someone, the ""perfect one"", and came to realize - especially after we tried to build a relationship - that it was more in my mind when I imagined her as an ideal.  It held me back for years.  But once the reality of it came to me, I was able to move on, even as I preserved for a long time one of the greatest friendships of my life.  I think the character is much like this, that the film is a snapshot of that moment, and I have never seen a film that expressed this so well.
