6487858,2,B00LI5GSIE,"I'm not sure what kind of dub this is, but the sound quality is atrocious.  It seems that they have the music tracks turned up way higher than the voice, so it can be difficult to hear.  I'd attempt to find a different vendor/copy if I were looking for this again....which I may.",1433462400,4,279,4.245283018867925
6487859,1,B00LI5GSIE,"This is a very low quality DVD, obviously not a studio release.  The colors are washed out, the sound mixing is not balanced, and even the aspect ratio is weird--there is a black border around the picture in all 5 shows.  The music is louder than the vocals so you cannot understand the dialogue, and in the Halloween special, the vocals and the music are not in sync, so it just sounds awful.  Don't waste your money.",1420761600,9,418,4.402597402597403

6487890,4,B00LI5GSIE,"The Garfield Holiday Collection Collector's Edition is no longer a Wal-Mart exclusive.  With that put aside, this dvd set is great to own since CBS no longer airs these holiday specials during the holidays.  The new Collector's Edition by Anderson Digital includes all three Garfield holiday classics; A Garfield Christmas, Garfield's Thanksgiving, and Garfield's Halloween Adventure.  This dvd set also includes two bonus episodes; Garfield on the Town, and Garfield In Paradise.  Also included are some special features.

There are two different versions of this dvd, however.  One version of this dvd has some audio problems during Garfield in Paradise.  During some of the dialogue, the music plays louder than the characters while they're speaking.  Throughout a large portion of the episode, the music is loud, and the characters speak low, causing you to have to readjust the volume back and forth.

The other version of this dvd seems to fix the audio issues, although the problem slightly persists.  However, during the Christmas episode, the part where Grandma plays the piano is missing.  That part is replaced with the mom playing piano, and the family singing Christmas tunes.  Both versions have the exact same case and artwork, so there's no way to tell which version has the corrected audio and which has the original piano scene.

Overall, this set, hopefully you'll receive the one with the corrected audio, is a must-own for any fan of Garfield.  Although I still prefer the original 2004 dvd released by 20th Century Fox, I highly recommend owing this dvd set because it comes with extra episodes and special features.",1454630400,8,1638,5.132075471698113

6487903,4,B00LI5GSIE,I have been looking for this holiday collection for a while and I was thrilled it finally resurfaced! I was pleasantly surprised to see a couple more specials on here bringing the running time to a little over an hour (yay!). It is filled with so much sweet nostalgia and features that orange fat cat I have loved since childhood (and not the awful live action movies where they ruin everything).

6487916,5,B00LI5GSIE,"Finally all the holiday specials are back on DVD.. Do not know what sound or visual problems some of the other reviews are talking about.. It looks and sounds fine...

Very glad I picked this DVD up.",1448668800,,376,4.164383561643835
6487917,5,B00LI5GSIE,"First off, the DVD copy I received had no audio/video issues whatsoever. Not only was the audio mixed properly but I was actually surprised of the video quality. I found the colors to be surprisingly vibrant and almost as if they have a slight ""saturated"" look to them. I think the production company did a fine job of making the transfer from original format to DVD. Perhaps the original copies had some known issues that they worked out? Again, no audio/video issues with this purchase. I have to admit I never got a chance to see these TV specials when they originally aired but I was a huge fan off the Garfield and Friends TV show back in the 80s growing up and that's ultimately what swayed me to make this purchase. And, I'm glad I did because this Garfield Holiday Collection totally delivers! So nostalgic to see Garfield when the animated cartoon was in it's prime. Not only will you enjoy the superb holiday specials but also get two additional episodes thrown in for free (along with some DVD extras as well) The price alone is worth the buy. I highly recommend this DVD. If you have younger kids that have not experienced the older cartoons like this and the Peanuts holiday specials I think they would really enjoy it! Thanks Amazon, 5 stars.",1447891200,3,1256,4.586666666666667

6487930,4,B00LI5GSIE,"If you've been longing to get Garfield's original holiday classics from the 80's on DVD, and missed out on Fox's 2004 DVD, now's you're chance to get Anderson Digital's re-release, not just at Walmart anymore. Garfield's Halloween Adventure (1985), Garfield's Thanksgiving (1989), and A Garfield Christmas Special (1987), are back on 1 DVD, only now each special's restored in HD and remain in their original Fullscreen format, especially on classic 4x3 TV's with DVD players (I checked)! For those of you longing to have the original unaltered version of Garfield's Christmas special from 1987, you're in luck with this new DVD, because it's in here, now restored in HD! (Sadly, the revised version from 1991 isn't in here as a bonus feature.) Lots of footage, mostly small stuff, was trimmed down or cut out to make room for the piano scene, and the revised sequence of Grandma's chat with Garfield, for the 1991 version, as Jim Davis himself points out in a new 22-minute documentary all about Paws Inc. and its history. This disc also has a commercial for a mobile app called Garfield Living Large, a short photo gallery of Garfield's history (and precursor strip Norm Gnat), and 2 non-holiday specials; Garfield on the Town and Garfield in Paradise, also restored in HD. Somehow, no such luck for the music and sound effects for Garfield on the Town, even though the speaking and singing were perfectly fine; it never sounded shaky or wobbly in Garfield as Himself in 2004. Garfield in Paradise really is restored in HD, music and all, when comparing its presentation to that of Garfield Travel Adventures in 2005. What's more, there's no ""play all"" selection on this new disc, if you wanted to see all 5 specials at one time, any time of the year. Sadly, it doesn't contain any closed-captioning (even though the covers say so) OR disc subtitles, in any program here, nor Spanish language/subtitle tracks, nor an FBI warning to start the disc off, like Fox's version from 2004. It's better to go for this new DVD than to pay a lot of dough for a used Fox DVD, and worry about it freezing in any of the specials. ""Never send a man to do a cat's job"", as the famous ""lardball"" tabby once said.",1436918400,23,2197,4.738903394255875
