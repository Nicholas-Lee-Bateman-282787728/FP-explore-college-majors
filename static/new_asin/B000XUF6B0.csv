8229779,3,B000XUF6B0,"Chancer, Series 2, (1991). The raw young smolderingly sexy Clive Owen had his first television series lead in this show, and it was the breakout part that made him a star. It is a neo-noir British crime drama, in color, and was originally made by Central for ITV. It was a ratings smash in the United Kingdom, and has been compared to DALLAS, DYNASTY and TWIN PEAKS.  In it, Owen played Stephen Crane, a rude and arrogant, smooth-talking, shady investment analyst; ingenious, unprincipled, and charming: a swindler and a thief who'd been fired by an investment bank after one dodgy deal too many.

This second series arrives in a box set of two volumes comprising seven episodes of approximately 350 minutes. Unfortunately, the set does not include subtitles, and many, who live on my side of the pond, including me, will find that, though they can usually follow the plot, they will miss much of the dialog, and some of the plot's finer points. Acorn, the manufacturers, also warns that due to the age of these programs and the improved resolution of the DVD media, viewers may notice occasional flaws in the image and audio that they could not correct.

Owen, of course, has long since achieved film stardom, see&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Children-of-Men/dp/B000QGAU4E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Children of Men</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Croupier/dp/B0001BKACG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Croupier</a>, or his Oscar-nominated turn in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Closer/dp/B000JY8F22/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Closer</a>. He opens  Series 2 as conman Derek Love, a.k.a. Stephen Crane, just released from prison and scheming to save not only the estate of his former co-worker/friend/competitor/romantic rival, Piers Garfield-Ward (Simon Shepherd).  The two men are also cooperating in efforts to save Joseph, the orphaned child of their mutual late love, Joanna Franklyn, who helpfully reappears throughout in flashbacks and dreams.  ( She is played by blond of the decade Susannah Harker,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/House-of-Cards-Trilogy-The-Original-UK-Series-Remastered/dp/B009Z59ZNE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">House of Cards Trilogy:  The Original UK Series Remastered</a>).  They are struggling to keep the child from the sole custody of his grandfather, the great City financial wiz Tom Franklyn, as played by the energetic Peter Vaughan (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Death-at-a-Funeral/dp/B0016LTNL4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Death at a Funeral </a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Remains-Of-The-Day/dp/B000S6EKXE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Remains Of The Day</a>).

Series 2 is, like series 1, packed with plot twists and double/triple crosses; it features returning faces from Series 1 as well as a new romantic interest played by Leslie Lombard (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-House-of-Eliott-Complete-Collection/dp/B000PC6YUI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The House of Eliott - Complete Collection</a>), a woman on the run from her own questionable past.

Roman then kidnaps baby Joseph and Anna. After he's demanded  ransom, Roman phones Dex, saying ominously, ""Come to the Holy City--alone. You can be Abraham. I'll be God.""

The series is, of course, a perfect vehicle for the young Owen, whose star quality shines through.  He is backed by a solid ensemble providing good support.  In fact, the acting throughout is sufficient; and the production, lavish.  However, if you can't tell, the series' plots, although compelling, are somewhat over the top. It is deeply rooted in the go-go, greed is good 1980's and 1990s, and somewhat dated. If, in the grim years that followed the breaking of this bubble, you have been missing tales of predatory investment bankers and asset stripping - and you have very sharp hearing -- this series may be for you.",1368489600,,6086,6.2377538829151735
8229780,5,B000XUF6B0,"Hi I also found Chancer a very good series, to me it was like a series of cat and mouse, with a very excellent story line. I love Clive Owens and as far as I am concern he has never let me down with his movies, or Tv Series.
Wish there could be a series 3
Chancer has many great actors which also makes this series a must to watch. I hope other also get the pleasure of sitting back and relaxing on a cold day and being entertained by the best. Thank you Amazon another hit for me.

8229782,5,B000XUF6B0,"Chancer is a wonderful series made before Clive Owen was discovered by American audiences.  The character he plays here is amoral, dishonest, and greedy.  In short, a really compelling character in a great series.",1205971200,3,213,5.235294117647059
8229783,5,B000XUF6B0,"Clive is excellent in this british drama series, enjoyed the first chancer series, recently purchased the second series, i found the storylines more dark and compeling, i highly recommemd it, this was the catalyst for cementing clives acting career.",1205366400,,249,5.410256410256411
8229784,5,B000XUF6B0,"The second year in the Chancer series is even better than the first year.
It is disappointing in that it has only has four episodes.  The characters are brilliantly played.  Clive Owen just keeps getting better with each performance.",1205193600,5,233,4.948717948717949
