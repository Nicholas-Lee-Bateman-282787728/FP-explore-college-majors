7167145,5,B003LRQ0YY,"I'll cut right to the chase here:  The ""unsung"" (no pun intended) hero of this performance is the conductor, Andris Nelsons.  Based on this performance, I rate him as the greatest conductor of Puccini that I have ever heard. (!!)  He's that great.  Most opera lovers (such as myself) would probably not rate Puccini on a par with Verdi or Wagner, but Nelsons shows no signs of such thinking here.  In the Extras he describes this opera as a masterpiece and he conducts it with a love appropriate to that assessment:  spirited where needed, limpid where needed, and always letting the music ""breathe""; plus always being sensitive to his singers--they must love singing for him--; a ""singers' conductor"".  You owe it to yourself to buy this dvd for Nelsons alone.  You and I would say that the first love in this opera is between Rodolfo and Mimi and second love is between Marcello and Musetta, but in this performance the first love is between Nelsons and Puccini's music.  Should you think I may be going over-the-top here, Nelsons receives a thunderous ovation from the audience at the end--tell you something?

As it happens, the rest of this performance is on the same level!  This production dates from 1974, but you would never guess it by looking at it.  Full of freshness and vitality--hats off to John Copley.  It looks like no expense was spared in the sets and especially in the costumes.  And here is another interesting lesson for those who have the eyes to see:  This is very much a ""traditional"" staging:  no regietheater, no gimmicks.  What it shows us is that quality and substance and even timelessness are to be found in a devoted probity to the music, to the original concept--the triumph of love over egoism and over a  creativity/originality that is more or less for its own sake.

The singers:  In Puccini you want power, but not at the expense of beauty, whereas in Wagner, for example, we will willingly sacrifice some in vocal beauty to obtain the heldentenor or heldensoprano effects.  In the singers here you get both the beauty and the drama.  Teodor Ilincai as Rodolfo:  very fine dramatic tenor with a strong, clear top, equally fine in quiet passages.  Also a very good actor.  His Rodolfo is not the ""romantic poet"" type as we picture that type, but more a sensitive ""boy next door"".  Of the four Bohemians living in the loft, he seems like the ""normal"" one amongst three other ""characters"".  Mimi, Hibla Gerzmava, is herself a ""girl next door"" type.  Frankly, I've not seen Gerzmava's equal as Mimi. (!)  Gorgeous and expressive voice and portrayal.  The simple and modest love between these two contrasts vividly with the tempestuous romance between Marcello and Musetta.  Inna Dukach is lights-out as Musetta:  You get the feeling that she IS Musetta, not a singer-actress portraying Musetta.  She gloriously owns Act II, and yet, because their love is of a different kind, Rodolfo and Mimi are never overshadowed by her.  You absolutely HAVE to see Dukach here:  unforgettable.  No let-down in the other singers either, or in their acting.  (I could go on about each one, but I am getting tired of typing and you are probably getting tired of reading this.)

If you own other Boheme dvds, as I do, you MUST still buy this one; it goes right to the top.",1311292800,12,3289,4.735449735449736
7167146,5,B003LRQ0YY,"It is amazing to watch an opera live on blu-ray and also to have all characters not only being talented but also good looking. I rarely watch an opera on DVD/Bluray Disc in one sitting. But this opera I watched since beginning to the end. The Bluray disc experience made me feel like I was there at that theatre. During the change of acts I got up to open another bottle of red wine and at the end of the opera when Rodolfo finds out that Mimi is dead and cries out at the top of his lungs those two little sillables singing ""MI-MI.....MI-MI!!!"" This part always breaks my heart and it brings tears to my eyes. Excellent opera one of the best. I have about nine recordings of this opera and I can watch this one over and over again.",1302307200,4,732,4.198581560283688
7167147,5,B003LRQ0YY,"I got this for my parents as an accompanying gift to the blu-ray player I was getting them for Christmas. I am not an opera expert -- but it was one of the only live productions on blu-ray, well-reviewed and some youtube searches of the leads checked out... so it felt like a no-brainer.

No surprise, the opera-loving parents loved it.  Sound and picture-quality is crisp and full (looks beautiful on a big screen), the leads breathe life into the roles and sing BEAUTIFULLY, the production value is impressive, lots of goosebumps throughout -- but what I wasn't expecting was crying like freakin Julia Roberts at the opera in Pretty Woman during Rodolfo's aria to Mimi -- it was so darn pretty!  For such a famous piece, it was like i was hearing it for the first time, like i finally ""got"" it.  Ilinca as Rodolfo is dreamy, genuine, tender and passionate.  It was the first time i watched a full opera and now i'm kinda hungry for more!

Opera experts, by all means make your own educated decision -- Opera novices like me who don't know where to start?  -- just buy it!!!",1295049600,18,1075,4.510309278350515

Opus Arte Blu-ray Disc

Puccini's La Boheme is one of the most beloved operas of all time, and rightfully so.  Therefore, as one would expect, there are already many fine performances of Boheme available on DVD including, for example, the 2003 La Scala performance with Marcelo Alvarez and Cristina Gallardo-Domas, and the older, but still impressive, 1967 La Scala performance with a young Mirella Freni and Gianni Raimondi.  In my opinion, however, this new Blu-ray DVD of a 2009 Royal Opera House performance, starring Russian soprano Hibla Gerzmava as Mimi and Rumanian tenor Teodor Ilincai as Rodolfo, deserves to go to the top of the list.  Here's my rationale:

First; the mostly youthful cast brings a joie de vivre to their performances that is very appropriate and that compliments both the music and the Bohemian characters they are portraying.  And equally important: they all sing beautifully!  (It should be noted that veteran bass, Donald Maxwell, brings a comedic style to his Act II portrayal of the aging rou, Alcindoro, that is genuinely funny.)

Second; conductor Andris Nelsons keeps the music moving along at an appropriate pace while also providing the singers with tempos and dynamic shadings that allow them some latitude in the delivery of their big numbers.

Third; the scenery, costuming, staging and lighting are effective and tastefully traditional, and add considerably to the visual experience.

Fourth; the quality of the sound and the picture on this Blu-ray disc is state-of-the-art excellent.

And finally; the extras include separate interviews with conductor Nelsons and stage director John Copely, both of whom have informative and interesting things to say.

All in all, a marvelous package for opera lovers that definitely passes the goose-bump test!",1287532800,47,1831,5.29757785467128
8715718,5,B003LRQ0YY,wonderful.  My MOM LOVED this dvd.,1520553600,,34,4.666666666666667
8715719,3,B003LRQ0YY,"Not being familiar with any of the singers, I ordered for the beautiful, traditional production, and also to hear Andris Nelsons, the new director of Boston Symphony.  The production certainly does deliver, it is 100% traditional.  Also very happy with the musical direction.

It's also a pleasure to see a production with young performers who look the part without straining credibility.  Sure I love the Pavarotti videos, but the portly middle-aged and balding Rodolfo does tend to detract visually.  These are excellent young singers and don't sacrifice ""too much"" in not sounding exactly like Pavarotti ....

As others have noted, there are problems with sound.  The orchestra is well-miked, being stationary.  The singers come and go in a few places, particularly in Act 2.

I am aware it must be difficult to make a perfect sound recording at a live event with a lot of movement on stage.  But I think for this price, the engineers have to put their heads together BEFOREHAND and come up with something better.  It is a disappointment for the high price.",1508025600,,1060,4.932203389830509
8715720,3,B003LRQ0YY,"I ordered this Blu-ray based on multiple Five Star reviews here and was enormously disappointed.  The principal singers were barely adequate and at times were overpowered by the orchestra and were hardly audible.  The two principal roles of Rodolfo and Mimi were poorly acted and stars Hibla Gerzmava and Teodor Ilincai were neither believable nor very attractive.  Inna Dukach in the role of Musetta was similarly inaudible at times.  Perhaps it was the recording quality but I was definitely unimpressed.  The only supporting role that was decently acted and sung was by Gabriele Viviani in the role of Marcello.

I will, however, award the production three stars for outstanding sets and costumes, and resume my search for an acceptable Boheme on Blu Ray.  Overpriced and definitely not recommended.",1491436800,,802,5.21875
8715721,4,B003LRQ0YY,Terrific performances but the quality of the filming and engineering of the sound is materially inferior to Met Live disks.,1454803200,,123,5.2
8715722,5,B003LRQ0YY,I absolutely love this production.  It is my favorite of all the Bohemes I have seen. The singing is excellent and the young conductor shows a real understanding of Puccini and his music.,1400112000,,187,4.666666666666667
8715723,5,B003LRQ0YY,"The story is just lovely as Puccini's music, story, etc.  All the singers are very good and it is well done.  I recomend it very much.",1392422400,,134,4.115384615384615
8715724,4,B003LRQ0YY,"I have read the many reviews for all three of the Boheme performances that I currently own. What is quite clear is that each of them receives enthusiastic support by overwhelming numbers who see each as the definitive version! There are also those who totally dislike each version. There are also minor reservations voiced about each version by a handful of reviewers. So where does this leave the prospective new purchaser?

Firstly it is possible to suggest that there are at least 3 good versions available, all of which are likely to give great satisfaction to a great number of people. This is perhaps because this opera is such a fine creation that it enables the participants to rise to their best. So if there is a world class team engaged it is likely that you will get a world class result with little risk of failure.

Rather than give a detailed review of each version therefore I will attempt a general summary of the options based on these 3 productions. They are the two Zeffirelli productions at The Met and at La Scala. There is also the Copley production by way of comparison at the Royal Opera.

There are some key considerations in my opinion. Firstly the group of four men must work well as a team in addition to individual merits. Rodolfo, Mimi, Musetta and Marcello must also communicate strongly to each other in the same way. The end must be genuinely draining.

The Met performance from 2008 delivers on all counts. Gheorghiu and Vargas both deliver a believable relationship with each other. All 4 men relate well to each other. Tezier and Arteta as Musetta also have a believable relationship and the whole production benefits from the extravagant, but always appropriate Zeffirelli concept ranging through an excellent garret, a spectacular Act 2 crowd scene, and the desolation of Acts 3 and 4. I personally feel that there are preferable Musettas and the small but important roles of Benoit and Alcindoro to those on offer here. The recording is of a good visual and sonic standard with sound presented in DTS 5.1 and stereo options but it is a shame that it has not been produced as a Blu-ray (yet). This is a very slick and professional rendition.

The competing Zeffirelli performance from La Scala is very fine too. This musters a particularly vibrant team of men who relate especially well together. The Benoit and Alcindoro roles are, to my mind, more effective. The Musetta of Hei-Kyung Hong is simply outstanding and is a far more effective flirty portrayal which also shows considerable humanity and depth of understanding in the last scene. The role of Mimi is very different to that of Gheorghiu as Mimi here is of a far more `ordinary' appearance and without Gheorghiu's innate glamour and sheer `star' quality which always radiates through. Gallardo-Domas portrays much more the ordinary attractions of an ordinary and rather vulnerable woman. In this she is well matched by Alvarez. These two skilled singers relate well in these ways and their shared tragedy hits home at that level. For me, I find this even more moving than The Met performance for all that's star quality. On the downside however, I feel that the staging in Act 2 comes over as rather more cramped and thus relatively static at La Scala and the conducting and orchestral response is just a notch less crisp. A direct comparison between the starts of Acts 1 & 2 in both performances will show this - but the differences are quite small and do not outweigh the many other virtues. The recording was made in 2003 and provides good imaging and the sound is presented in DTS 5.1, DD 5.1 and stereo options. These values are of good quality for 2003.

That leaves the Copley production at the Royal Opera as on offer here. I find my responses to this to be more uneven. The four men have the great advantage of being younger and not so well fed! The concept that these four men are living in abject poverty always stretches credulity when they are clearly considerably overweight as in most performances including the two Zefferelli options. However, the downside here is that Rodolfo in particular seems relatively immature and is unable to drag up the reserves of grief at the end. Alvarez does best at this followed at a short distance by Vargas. This Musetta similarly seems to lack the same sort of depth. One is aware that she is acting rather than being the part. Hei-Kyung is in a different league to this - and is also more seductively aware. The other men all do well but the star of this production for me is the Mimi of Gerzmava who has the youth, the voice and the concept of ultimate doomed fragility. The orchestral playing is possibly the best here as a result of fine conducting by Nelsons. The recording from 2009 is of good quality visually and the sound is presented in DTS 5.1 and stereo options

In conclusion then I would rate all three as fine productions in their ways with the La Scala / Zefferelli as first choice closely followed by the Met / Zeffirelli in second and with the Royal Opera production in third place. In the end though, it is all a matter of taste and personal preference as detailed reading of the many reviews will clearly reveal. Happy viewing and listening whichever you choose!",1342310400,12,5234,4.701199563794984
8715725,2,B003LRQ0YY,"Based on the customer comments, I purchased this performance. Unfortunately, I found it to be disappointing. While reasonably well produced and conducted, the singing when compared with the many other versions available is only adequate and nowhere near world class. All of the performers certainly are competent and attractive but none equal or surpass the many alternative DVDs.",1317081600,3,380,5.568965517241379
8715726,1,B003LRQ0YY,"I amazed that other reviewers gave this 5 stars. When playing this dvd the sound kept on fluctuating so that I had to constantly readjust it. I returned the DVD and was charged a ""partial refund fee"" of $15.00 by Amazon which I consider unjustified.",1315612800,3,249,4.555555555555555
8715727,5,B003LRQ0YY,"Nellie Melba,nee Mitchell. She named herself after Melbourne. Australian to the core, but a snob. Called sweet and low by Peter Dawson,a baritone. She had a beautful voice but swore. She once famously said to Clara Butt, the English Contrato,who was visiting Australia,""sing them muck"". At Covent Garden, she sung La Boheme opposite Caruso who had a sense of humour. When singing ""Che gelida manina"" to her, he pressed into her hand a hot sausage which he had his dresser heat over a spirit lamp in the wings. She screamed with shock and flipped the said sausage through the air. The front row tittered. She swore under her breath. Caruso carried on singing. Then in a pause for breath he said, ""English lady, you like sausage"". (Opera: Viking press- ed Brook 1995). Puccini would have appreciated that.

The Director  and designer of this La Boheme are the same as for the 1982 version ,so the sets are the same. The singers were Cortrubas as Mimi,Shicoff as Rodolfo ,Thomas Allan cond Gardelli. The orchestra and the singers  are passionate. It is my favourite La Boheme. To be fair I shall not compare the new 2009 version with the 1982 version,but on its own merits. It is very traditional. The Royal opera house orchestra is conducted by Andris Nelsons, emotionally with often fast tempo's when required . A young chap which suits the cast. This is his first time at this House. The cast is believable,all young. You know why Rodolfo wants to go to bed with Mimi and vice versa. What a beautiful voice this Mimi Hibla Gerzmava has. For Puccini one must have passion in the voice. Teodor Ilincai has a voice very much of the Marcelo Alvarez kind. It doesnt strike you at first as having that passion. For example, like the Maltese Tenor,Joseph Calleja. He has that distinctive voice that makes you gulp. Musetta  Inna Dukach is good. The other parts are well sung and as I stated are young. The other Blu ray with Mula and Conducted by Corbus-Lopez, I have not heard yet. Worldwide. 1080 HD.",1311724800,2,1995,4.691428571428571
