These two parodies of Re-Animator and Exorcist with a sex theme were awesome. I hope to find more of her work in the future.",1411689600,,284,4.377358490566038
8235554,2,B000ZJ2ZRM,"I was a little disappointed with this movie. It was too short and the first 'short film' The Xxxorcist was censored! If I had known this I would not have purchased. I was expecting two longer films, similar to Joanna's regular work, with more shown! A lot 'longer' and more 'hard' core.",1316563200,,286,4.519230769230769
8235555,1,B000ZJ2ZRM,"I waited months for this to come out. I bought it, waited a week for arrival, only to find my copy censored. Amazon should be ashamed of them selves.

Other then that, great flick! Don't look for artistic meaning in zombie porno, that's just ridiculous. Great camp value and joanna Angel's a total foxxx! And as far as tommy pistol having the Master Shake tatoo right on brother! AQUA TEEN HUNGER FORCE NUMBER ONE IN THE HOOD G!",1219276800,2,428,4.487179487179487
8235556,2,B000ZJ2ZRM,"While the originals would have earned 5 star reviews, this version which contains versions that have been edited (and have huge black CENSORED bars over parts of the film that are not included in the originals) are not worth your time, unless of course you would be offended by sex, but then why would you be purchasing these in the first place if that were the case?!?!?",1217721600,9,371,4.552238805970149
8235557,3,B000ZJ2ZRM,"This is a 2-part DVD.  The only part worth your time is the reinterpretation of ""The Exorcist,"" as the ""ReAnimator"" one was a disappointment.

Softcore porn with blurring of the naughty bits, so it can be placed in ""family"" video stores that don't shelve porn.  There is also an uncensored version of the XXXorcist available, which I have not seen.

The f/x and costumes are straight out of the 70s, and this is an amusing and irreverant spoof, making lots of bad puns on classic lines from the original film (i.e.: ""Your mother sucks c**ks in Hell . . . but not as good as meeeeee!"") . . . and then there is the questionable use of religious icons during the ""sexorcism.""  Kudos for the option of multiple alternate endings.

I do agree with the other reviewer that the priest should not have had his ""Shake from ATHF"" tattoo exposed, as it kinda ruined the effect.

Made me laugh several times.  Amusing.",1208908800,4,906,4.549382716049383
8235558,3,B000ZJ2ZRM,"I rated the dvd as OK being as it was about what I expected.  That does not mean I would recommend it or that I liked it.

Essentially what you have here is not a movie or even 2 short films.  That would be giving them too much credit.  There is little to no creativity or originality comprising the two parts of this dvd.

In the XXXorcist (one part of the dvd) you have an attempt at an erotic version of the exorcism scenes from the Exorcist movie.  I assume that the writer/director/producer thought it would be cool to take a favorite set of scenes from the exorcist movie and add hard core eroticism to them. Unfortunately it just isn't interesting or even erotic.  The tattoo's of all three actors(?) not only nulifies any possibility of imparting an erotic impression but it also cheapens the ""adaptation"".  There is just no way you can take seriously this attempt to make an erotic version of the exorcist when the supposed priest/exorcist has a blatantly visible tattoo of ""Shake"" from ""Aqua Teen Hunger Force"".

The second part of the dvd is also an obvious attempt to make an erotic version of Re-Animator.  This attempt falls just as flat as the other part of the dvd.  The only correlation to Re-Animator is the injection of a serum that brings the dead back to life. However once brought back to life, the re-animated corpse has only sex on it's mind(?) and the remainder of the ""Re-Penetrator"" is just a porn scene between the supposed scientist and the re-animated female corpse.  The two actors(?) in this part of the dvd are the same as are in the XXXorcist part of this dvd and again, the tattoo's just make the whole thing ludicrous.

However, to be fair, with the exception of the obvious and ridiculous tattoos of the cast, the dvd is exactly what I expected.  The ""special effects"" are about what you'd expect from a movie with little to no budget.  To their credit, I have seen much worse production quality.

If you are interested in erotic versions of the above mentioned horror movies, you might enjoy this dvd.  Otherwise don't waste your money!",1206576000,8,2074,4.592391304347826
