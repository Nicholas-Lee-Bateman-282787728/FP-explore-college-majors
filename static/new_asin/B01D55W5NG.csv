His classic book the Gift of Therapy is a must read for all psych minded people. Love's Executioner stole my heart and this up close and frank look onto the life of this powerful career influencer can no less be overstated.  Its heartfelt,  its personal,  and it touched me.

I recommend this to all up and coming folks in the counseling field.",1486944000,2,505,4.434782608695652

8754900,2,B01D55W5NG,"I was quite disappointed by the way in which this film was created. Yalom has decades of experience as an existential psychotherapist
and this film is not up to the task in reflecting it. You would think that, while sharing his past with Marilyn is part of his story, he would also go about sharing at length the many existential problems we face in the world and offer us new insights that are not in his books. Instead, much the film's time is filled up showing scenic views of nature, the ocean, kids playing Frisbee, scuba diving, vintage clips and those when he was young, and all the while sparingly giving here and there a few word of existential wisdom. And why show him at exotic locations scuba diving to places the average person can't afford? I find it distracting. I was also disappointed that he was reading from his books instead of bring to our attention the dire existential problems we face to day as Sheldon Solomon did at the TED web site
Solomon also provided the same quote from Thomas Hardy: ""If a way to the better there be, it lies in taking a full look at the worst"" But unlike Yalom, Sheldon points out that the existential problems we experience within, are having a disastrous effects without, i.e. climate change, wars, injustice, and inequality. Yalom makes no mention of this at length. The onus of human suffering is not just on us, but on the social and economic environment in which we live that affects us emotionally,psychologically, and spiritually and far more than we realize. How can we make sense of our very existence if the political and religious narratives we were born into are seriously flawed which distorts reality in ways that remove us from discovering our TRUE nature? Yalom makes no mention of this either. Anyway, and for me, Yalom's film is too slow and what was said could have been said in 30 minutes or less. His movie, ""When Nietzsche Wept"" was far more insightful.",1482969600,,1925,4.648093841642229

8754904,5,B01D55W5NG,"I became interested in the American psychotherapist Irvin Yalom (b. 1931) through his novels.  Yalom has the wonderful ability of combining philosophical depth with his practice of therapy.  He has written novels about three philosophers I love: ""When Nietszche Wept"", ""The Schopenhauer Cure"", and, probably the philosopher closest to my heart, ""The Spinoza Problem.""  Yalom also is close to existentialist thinking and to the work of the ancient stoics.  In addition to his novels, I also enjoyed Yalom's book ""Staring at the Sun: Overcoming the Terror of Death."" Yalom was kind enough to notice one of my reviews here on Amazon and we exchanged a few brief emails.

This new documentary ""Yalom's Cure: A Guide to Life, Love, and Happiness"" was originally released in Germany in 2014. The film was directed by a German filmmaker, Sabine Gisinger, who, as I did, became interested in Yalom through her reading. The film was released in the United States in 2015 and has recently been released on DVD by First Run Features which kindly sent me a review copy. I was glad to have another opportunity to visit Yalom.

It is always different to see a writer or person one admires in a context separate from the context in which one first gets to know the individual.  In this case, I knew Yalom through his philosophical novels. This film offers a brief look at Yalom's personal life as well as at his work. The documentary takes the viewer through Yalom's early life as the child of poor Jewish immigrants in Washington, D.C. in the 1930s.  I enjoyed seeing the footage of what has become my home town. We learn of Yalom's over 50 year marriage to his childhood sweetheart, his responses to college and medical school, and his four children. We see Yalom cooking in the kitchen, relaxing and laughing with family, in a hot tub, and riding a bike. There are things that may be missed when one over-intellectualizes a person. I should not have been surprised that some of Yalom does not come through in the books.

As I watched, I realized the film did well in integrating Yalom's personal life with his teachings. The film recreates Yalom leading individual and group therapy sessions in ways that often are moving. Particularly near the end of the film, Yalom, now in his 80s, discusses death and the manner in which the inevitability of death is a spur to human conduct and to living life with meaning. With cinematography set against the background of the ocean, these discussions are thoughtful and moving. I was most moved by Yalom's continued intellectual and physical activity as a man in his 80s. In his own life and in his teaching, he emphasizes living with zest, knowing that one lives in time, and trying to live fully and, to the extent possible without regret.

After viewing the documentary, I reread the reviews I have written about the books of Yalom I have read.  The following passage from my November 26, 2007, Amazon review of ""Staring at the Sun"" seems to me to capture some of the spirit of this documentary.  I wrote:

""In facing and coming to terms with death, Dr Yalom counsels that one must learn to love and find meaning in one's life, as Dr. Yalom says he has been able to do in his life through his career, writing, family, and friends. Consistently with Epicurus and a host of other teachers, Dr. Yalom finds the value of life heightened by an appreciation of its transcience. He writes ""The way to value life, the way to feel compassion for others, the way to love anything with greatest depth is to be aware that these experiences are destined to be lost.""""

I enjoyed getting to know and thinking about Yalom again through this film. In some respects, his continued activity and productivity are models for me.  I appreciate his love of philosophy and of the life of the mind. Although not stressed in the film, I have also learned from, and essentially share, his commitment to secularism and to the search for meaning and purpose in life outside the context of one's birth religion. This is a fine film that will appeal to those with some familiarity with the work of Irvin Yalom.

Total Time:  74 minutes
