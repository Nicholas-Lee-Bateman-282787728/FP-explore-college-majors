8539604,4,B009CI8RD8,I did watch this movie in 1986 on tv with closed caption. It was a very good movie. I decided to watch it again because its been a long time.  I expected this DVD with subtitled  but I am very disappointed that it doesn't have subtitled on it after I ordered it few days ago.  It should add subtitled when deaf people want to watch it.,1474848000,,335,4.045454545454546
8539605,5,B009CI8RD8,"This is a great movie full of emotions.  Once you start watching it, you can't stop.  It is one you will watch again and share with others.",1468454400,,139,4.111111111111111
8539606,5,B009CI8RD8,"Finally found this made for TV movie on DVD. This is a movie that I really liked when I saw it  many years ago. It may be a little dated but it still has a great story.  If you like the 'made for TV' movies, this is a must see.",1410998400,,227,3.52
8539607,5,B009CI8RD8,"I first watched this movie years ago and I taped it on VHS.  It's about two women, really, though only one is there for most of the movie.  One is killed in an accident and the other's brain dies from an aneurysm.  They do a ""brain transplant"" and save the brain from the accident victim and put it into the aneurysm victim's body.  It was fascinating to watch the woman try to come to terms with her new looks and her life while the husband of the other woman struggles to understand why this body is no longer his wife.  It was very well done and has a believable ending, I think.",1398816000,2,582,4.160714285714286
8539608,5,B009CI8RD8,I HAVE NOT WATCHED THIS MOVIE YET BECAUSE IT IS NOT CLOSED CAPTIONED AND I NEED CC BADLY THESE DAYS. BUT I DID WATCH IT YEARS AGO AND IT IS TERRIFIC AND VERY UNUSUAL.
