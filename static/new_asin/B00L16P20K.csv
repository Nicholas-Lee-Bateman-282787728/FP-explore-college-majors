6456853,3,B00L16P20K,"While I like the premise of the show, having a hard time getting past Mr. Burns signature ADD editing. If you've watched ancient aliens, then you know you are going to be told the same thing over and over again. Be prepared to have logical follow-on questions to certain revelations not be asked, or even thought about. In other words, be prepared to see material which could make for great television be poorly presented.
 The subject matter is interesting, and the brothers are pretty good in front of the camera. But I'm not sitting through teaser after teaser to be told the same thing over and over. Forget it Ken.",1413244800,6,619,4.627272727272727

6456855,5,B00L16P20K,"I am not usually a fan of reality TV.  Despite what we are told, much of what happens on some of these reality shows is scripted and therefore NOT real life.  As a result, theres no appeal for me.  So when I tell you I have found a reality TV show worth watching, you should definitely perk up and listen.  THE CURSE OF OAK ISLAND is an amazing viewing experience that you will watch over and over.  Ive watched it once, and Im already itching to replay it again.  Filled with suspense and intensity, this is one show I hope to see more seasons of soon.

THE CURSE OF OAK ISLAND will bring out childhood fantasies in even the staunchest of adults.  If you're like me, you used to imagine treasure hunts and buried loot as a kid, and those dreams filled you with a sense of awe and wonder.  This show captures those feelings and fills each episode with them.

The show is shot well, in typical documentary style.  But theres no dry narration or flat text-book style reading here.  Instead, we are given a front-row seat to the excavation of this centuries-old mystery.  We get to see firsthand the teams successes and failures as they seek to unravel the clues that will hopefully lead them to a resolution.

And that is what draws you in.  The team talks quite a bit about how obsession for this knowledge has ruined more than one life; we viewers get to feel a bit of that as the season progresses.  Their quest becomes our quest, and we yearn for some kind of answer.  THE CURSE OF OAK ISLAND is so immersive that you will find yourself contemplating a plane ride up to the see the place for yourself.

THE CURSE OF OAK ISLAND is a huge win for me, and I cannot wait for season 2.  If you love a good mystery, then this show is definitely for you.  It hits store shelves today, so check it out for sure.",1410220800,21,1805,4.284023668639053

6456868,4,B00L16P20K,"A favorite of my husband's which I also enjoy, just in smaller doses. The continuing saga of brothers fascinated with the history and tales of treasure to be found on this island near Canada. Rumored to be where either Knights Templar, Pirates or other explorers may have buried treasure from gold to religious artifacts. A bit too repetitive - you'll hear/see explanations of why they are there and what's happened so far so often you'll quickly realize that they are just repeating content to last a full episode and drag it out forever. Uses the same hype that's been around since Haraldo Rivera when into an Egyptian tomb and found nothing after building it up to a fever pitch. But still an enjoyable and informative show in spite of the hype.",1527724800,,748,4.717557251908397

Not the thing if you're in the mood for something fast-paced; but, if you want something calm that still manages to keep you watching for what's discovered next, this works pretty well for me. Don't worry much about the skull image on the box and the word ""Curse"" in the name, as this can make it sound creepy or scary --- it's neither.  These two brothers (and the people working with them) truly seem like family, and it's neat that people can be on such an educational and historic journey together.

6456950,2,B00L16P20K,"I must admit that this will be the last season I buy ahead of time.  I'm a cord-cutter, so Amazon is the easiest way to see the series.  I feel as the seasons have gone on, the format of the episodes has become increasingly insulting to its audience.  I'm intrigued by what the team are doing, and I would like to follow their exploits, but this entire season could have been presented in one two-hour special that recapped what did or did not happen.  Instead, they drag it out over 19 episodes, and each episode seems to have the same pattern:  10% - initial hype, 40% --building expectation, 40% -- disappointment and let down, 10% -- hype for the next episode where they might actually pay off on some of the hype (but they never do).  This season to me, more than previous seasons, had more of what felt like ""filler"" content.  They even had a ""special"" episode during the Olympics that was basically a retread of History Channel's other ""Templar"" shows.  In fact, I think much of the footage and narration I had seen on other shows.  The hype this season, also his a point where I found it wasn't simply ""teaser"", but outright dishonesty.  They teased things that turned out to be a total misrepresentation of what actually happened or was revealed.
These techniques have been used throughout the show, but this season took it too far for me.  Every episode I felt more disrespected as an invested viewer.  So next season, I will read the recaps, and wait until the end to see if its worth buying.  I feel the editors and producers of the show really need to check themselves, and even consider reducing the show to an annual ""Special"" that just recaps the events of the dig and not keep this repetitive hype-disappointment cycle, that they've seemed to embrace.",1520812800,2,1768,4.592356687898089

I love the guys on the show and the story, but my god,  all the repeating and recaps that the show and narrator does is just completely obnoxious this season, so inconsiderate and lazy to the viewers. Its so frustrating to watch now with all the repeating the same thing over and over and over. So many other people I know that watches the show says the same thing.  Im actually upset I bought this season, I wanted to support the show and cause by paying for it this Season since I don't have cable. I should have watched it for free on one of the rip off sites. Who ever produces, storyboards  this show just seems lazy. So not cool how they constantly repeat and do recaps. Seriously, more than half the episode is recaps. I just cant watch this show anymore as much as I use to love it. Producers of this show, please for the love of god stop the constant recaps and repeats!

It's that they strung it out with so much recapping and filler that it was intolerable.  If you don't have the material for 15 episodes, make it a short season of 10 or 12.  But, no, profit is the bottom line.  Episode 15 was particularly upsetting.  It was almost exclusively a show about the Knights Templar (largely recapped material), and if I had wanted something exclusively about them, I'd have watched a show designed for that purpose, not this one.

makes the Island and their financial contributions  worthwhile to those who pursued this fascinating journey.
