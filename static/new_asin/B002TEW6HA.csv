4514926,1,B002TEW6HA,"My purchase of this item was to use it in a class I was teaching on White Collar Crime. Unfortunately the presentation was biased beyond belief blaming the whole collapse of the mortgage system on George W. Bush. As someone who had researched the subject before seeing this presentation, I was well aware of the fact that this financial disaster went back to the Carter Administration and was pushed through Congress by Cong. Barney Frank, Sen. Chris Dodd and others who believed that everyone had a right to home ownership, even if they could not afford it or worked for it. The presentation clearly showed the pro-Democrat bias of CBS and 60 Minutes. And please note, I am not a Repbulican, just an objective instructor. Don't waste your time on this one. If you want the perspective on this DVD just order up Democrat Talking Points on the Mortgage Collapse.",1276214400,8,861,4.746666666666667

8451344,5,B002TEW6HA,This real explains the crash of 2008 and the housing bubble. They didn't go in to the government involvement as much as I would like....Barney Frank and his policies did more to destroy the financial lives of more people than any loan company or S&L combined.,1425686400,,259,4.6521739130434785
8451345,3,B002TEW6HA,"The documentary is decent but it could have used a broader range.  As a viewer I learned a lot about the subprime mortgage industry and the birth of CDO's from this film. I thought the interviews with Allen Greenspan were enlightening.  I find it very hard to believe he could not have slowed down the industry or clamp down on oversight and regulation.  He could have put pressure on Moody's and Standard and Poor to stop issuing AAA ratings for CDO's that did not meet that standard.  He was the most powerful business man in the country, who had the presidents ear any time he wanted.  It is as if he just stood by when he found out all these banks were making bogus deals with consumers buying homes they could not afford.  I honestly think he also thought the gravy train would never end.

I was bartending during this period of time from 2005-2008 and I saw all kinds of patrons come in bragging out new cars, jet ski's, quads, motorcycles, big screen TV's toys of all kinds.  A lot of people in this time period were clearly living beyond their means.  I wondered how they could afford such expensive toys on  blue collar salaries now I know.  Most of them took large amounts of equity out of their homes to go shopping. As president Bush and Allen Greenspan said in the film ""spend a little"", go out and have a good time.  Few people held themselves accountable or asked the age old question can I afford this?

I would have liked the producers to interview more homeowners in different parts of the country, instead of specifically focusing on California only.  Bend Oregon had some of the highest home prices in the country during this period of over inflated home prices and nothing was mentioned about that.  One trend I saw throughout the film was homeowners interviewed who took out equity in their homes to spend on luxury items such as pools and remodeling projects. Followed by those same people getting underwater in payments, and not being able to afford the home they just upgraded.  Refinancing is not always a good idea.  You see in the film that house building and construction was going through the roof during the boom.

In 2005 I could barely get into a 160,000 home with good credit.  How could all these people afford $350,000 homes and up with no down payment and bad credit history it did not add up.  I was looking for this documentary to make sense of the credit crisis and recession that followed and I felt it just scratched the surface.

What is sad about the whole mess is that none of the heads of the 5 major banks or the head people in charge of the credit agencies Standard and Poor, Moody's etc were ever charged with a crime for letting this happen.  The justice department must have had major kickbacks or be golfing buddies with the bankers because everyone got off scot free with the taxpayers holding the bag.  The mortgage bankers and stock brokers in the film all act as if they did nothing wrong when they are the ones who scammed the public.  All of those quick loan service providers should have been prosecuted.  These are the type of people that should be doing hard time. There is plenty of blame to go around to negligent homeowners, rating agencies issuing false ratings, 0 regulation by the regulators, bank investors selling stock that was basically a fraud. Those all together were a perfect storm for the recession that followed.

I only gave the film 3 stars because it is a big subject and I felt a lot of the whole story is left out.  I would watch this film alongside HBO's ""Too Big To Fail"" to get the other side of the story on the banks trying to save Lehman Brothers before they found out that that a ton of the subprime lenders were backed by AIG which was going to bring down the whole finance system after the crisis hit.",1425340800,,3792,4.497810218978103

8451348,5,B002TEW6HA,David Faber is excellent in providing a clear path thru the complex perfect storm of events that nearly destroyed our financial system.

It gives great detail about how the world economy tanked between 08-09 thanks to the housing bubble.

greed all around is the main reason!  Shocker I know :)",1303516800,,257,3.980392156862745
