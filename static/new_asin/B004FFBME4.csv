8427788,4,B004FFBME4,"These performances by Garrick Ohlsson were recorded in the 1970s, not so very long after he had won the International Chopin Competition in Warsaw, the only American ever to do so. The recital portion was recorded in 1974 (when Ohlsson was just 26) and the Brahms concerto in 1978.

The Brahms Second Piano Concerto, with James Loughran conducting the BBC Symphony Orchestra, was recorded live by BBC-TV at the 1978 Proms in the Royal Albert Hall, London. The very slender Ohlsson, always a commanding figure at 6'4"" (195cm), has enormous hands, capable of playing an octave plus a fifth, and it is a real pleasure to see them handling Brahms's often impossible chords and figurations with ease. This is a magisterial account of the concerto. It is a pity that the principal cellist playing that meltingly beautiful melody at the beginning of the third movement is unnamed in the DVD's booklet.

The recital portion of the DVD consists of a scintillating Chopin Scherzo No. 1 in B Minor, Op. 20; the 'Heroic' Polonaise in A Flat, Op. 53 (with Ohlsson's exceptionally exciting left-hand octaves in the final portion), and a moving Liszt 'Fun&eacute;railles' from the 'Harmonies po&eacute;tiques et religieuses'.

Sound is of its time in LPCM mono. Menu language: English; Picture format: 4:3; Region code: 0 (worldwide); Format: NTSC; TT=77:59.
