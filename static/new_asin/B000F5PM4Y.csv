8117740,5,B000F5PM4Y,"This particular version of this fabulous movie is in the original Italian and uncut.  Sophia Loren exudes joie de vivre and sexiness, even when dressed in matronly clothes.  Marcello Mastroianni in his role as the insensitive cad excels beyond any expectations.  Filumena Marturano, the novel upon which the film was based seems to have been written with Sophia in mind.  She successfully gaps the age differences from the shy, young teenage ingenue sent to work in a bordello to the confident, sexy madam to the business woman and onto a loving matronly Mother and wife.  This is a movie to showcase Sophia's many talents and it amply succeeds.  A pleasure to watch over and over again.",1378080000,,687,4.879310344827586
