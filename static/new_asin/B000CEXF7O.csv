The other characters were a bit too typical - Still Standing is a rip off of this show - same amount of kids, same blue collar parents, same party-hardy 70s parents.

We've pre-ordered this and are looking forward to getting it when it comes out!",1137110400,9,389,4.361111111111111
2460757,5,B000CEXF7O,"This was one of the best family sitcoms on TV. (Hard to find  sitcoms on tv anymore) Unfortunately, it was cancelled by 2 networks. Fox cancels everything too soon. The WB replaced it with some stupid Fran Drescher show that bombed and Blue Collar TV (yuk!). You can still catch ""Grounded"" in re-runs on ABC FAMILY. I Recorded every episode and transfered it to DVD..only to find out it's coming out on dvd.

If you are a fan of ""Roseanne"", you'll definately enjoy ""Grounded for Life"". The final season was the best. The daughter Lilly is very funny. My husband says the mom is ""HOT"".

I'm still surprised the show got cancelled.",1136937600,13,629,4.598214285714286

2460759,5,B000CEXF7O,"This is a great show, shown unfortunately at 1.30 am on Irish tv, with some great acting and some fun plots.  Have been wanting to get this on DVD and at last! This programme follows the Flannerty family with dad (chuck from ER), uncle eddie and claudia the mom with cool kids: lily, jimmy (what's with the hair?) and young  one  -- there's the crazy Sister Helen, who always pops up as the nice/evil nun in charge of the school that the kids go to as well as the neighbours next door.  There are a number of sub-plots along with the main story and it's refreshing in a sitcom that the writing is fresh, imaginative and creative.  There is a bit fun poked at the Catholic church and some morals along the way, but it's never preachy or PC-correct.  It's a laugh with real issues.",1134086400,9,779,4.337931034482758

2460786,4,B000CEXF7O,"Sean and Claudia Finnerty are an nice Irish Catholic couple in Staten Island, New York with their teenage daughter, Lily, and their sons, Henry and Jimmy. They are often visited by Sean's father played by Richard Riehle (Office Space) and Sean's brother, Eddie, played by Kevin Corrigan. Sean was played by Donal Logue and Claudia was played by Megyn Price (Rules of Engagement). This sitcom was different and a standout from other sitcoms past or present. Sean and Claudia had gotten married and a daughter right out of high school. They work dead end jobs just to survive and live comfortably in New York City's forgotten borough of Staten Island.

The sitcom was changed to having flashbacks in explaining the current situation. At first, I never could get into the show but I learned to watch and enjoy it on DVD. The show has some wonderful appearances by Miriam Flynn who played Sister Helen. The kids here go to Catholic school. There are plenty of wonderful moments about that especially when Sean learns an old friend has become a priest.

Lynsey Hartilson who played Lily did a fabulous and believable job. Kevin Corrigan was hysterical and believable as the cool uncle. Richard Riehle was a blast as the grandfather who didn't always know best. Sean and Claudia's parenting skills are questionable as well.

The DVD shows interviews with the cast and the creators especially about how the show came to be. They enjoyed each other as a family onscreen and offscreen as well. The cast seemed to fondly remember their time on a sitcom that didn't last very long perhaps only 91 episodes about 4 or 5 seasons on Fox television. It's a shame that Fox didn't promote it more. The show was funny and serious but also believable and realistic.",1414540800,,1746,4.794019933554817

2460814,5,B000CEXF7O,"This is the true situation comedy. The sets aren't very elaborate and the cast isn't huge, so the show relies on excellent writing & excellent acting. The basic premise finds a young married couple who married very early in life now have three children, but are sort of children themselves, and throws in a sleazy brother and a domineering (in a funny dopey way) father.

A lot of the show focuses on dealing with their teenage daughter. She rebels, she deals with boys, that kind of thing.  They also have two sons who seem to play slightly smaller roles, but are nonetheless extremely entertaining. Considering they're child actors, all three children do excellent jobs. There's also a boyfriend in the picture, but he doesn't get that much room to act in this season so hard to tell what his range is.

The closest show that comes to mind when I think about similar sitcoms was the extraordinary&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Titus/dp/B0009K8LCA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Titus</a>, probably my favorite sitcom of all time. All the episodes are good to great, but many of them do come to that level of excellence. My wife was laughing at me because I was laughing like a mental patient at some scene.  If you want to show that doesn't rely on a lot of flash to entertain you, but instead is just genuinely funny and well-written, you really can't go wrong with this series. You can really tell just from looking at all the other reviews here. The show was well loved and you'll enjoy it.

My only complaint, season 1 was too short at only 13 episodes.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Season-2/dp/B0058EE6NA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Season 2</a>&nbsp;has 22.

--------------------------------------------------

[Please Note: The 1 Star rating is NOT for the episodes themselves, but for the misleading packaging and for Carsey-Warner's lack of cooperation in helping the fans identify the altered episodes.]

I'm a big fan of Grounded For Life and have every episode on tape from the original Fox and WB broadcasts since day one (January 10, 2001).  I was thrilled with the prospect of buying all of the episodes on DVD (save for season 5 which hasn't been released yet) so that I could have better quality copies, taking up less shelf space, and could then erase all of the tapes I recorded.

Although I have not had the chance to watch any of the episodes on the Season 1-4 DVD sets, I did check out all of the discs (to ensure playability) and actually stumbled upon something that I did not like: The season 1 episode ""I Wanna Be Suspended"" (disc 1, episode 3) has been ALTERED!  The Ramones song ""I Wanna Be Sedated"" played during the concert scene in the original tv broadcast was replaced with generic music on the DVD (at 4:37), a brief concert flashback a few minutes later (at 7:28) replaced some instrumental song with a different instrumental song.  There may be more alterations to this episode, or other episodes in any of the sets, as I didn't check any further than this.

I know why music is routinely replaced on TV-on-DVD releases, so I don't have a problem with the replacing of the music.  However, I am displeased by the misleading packaging which states that these are ""uncut"" episodes.  Although there is a difference between ""uncut"" and ""unaltered"", the ""uncut"" remark on the box implies that the episodes are exactly the same as what was originally shown on TV, which obviously isn't true.  The ""uncut"" statement should have had an asterisk directing to text at the bottom to tell that music has been altered in some episodes.

I sent an e-mail to Anchor Bay (TVonDVD-AT-anchorbayent-DOT-com), the company that released the DVD sets, to get a complete list of all alterations (music or otherwise) for every Grounded For Life set.  Surely a list of alterations for every set must exist, as the person at Carsey-Warner whose job it is to replace the music when the episodes are prepped for DVD has to have a list to work off of.  Since I have the entire series on tape in their original network broadcast versions, I need to know which of my recorded episodes I need to keep because they're different from what I just bought on DVD, as I plan on erasing the taped episodes that are 100% exactly the same as on the DVD.

I received a reply from Rose Zivkovich.  She e-mailed Janet Bonifer, Executive Director of Marketing & Creative Services at Carsey-Warner (her address is either jbonifer-AT-carseywerner-DOT-com or jbonifer-AT-cwm-DOT-com), who told Rose that ""Our legal department advises against providing this type of information to consumers.""

These is no legal reason why Janet, or anyone else at Carsey-Warner, could not furnish the list to me (whether through Rose, or to me directly).  Anyone who has every episode on tape from the original Fox and WB broadcasts (like me) and has the time (not like me) could check every one of the 78 episodes (91 episodes, including Season 5) one-by-one to compile the same list.  Getting the list from Carsey-Warner would save time, energy, and insure completeness in the list.

I tried e-mailing Carsey-Warner directly via the most appropriate contact I could find (Janet's boss): Barron Postmus, bpostmus-AT-cwm-DOT-com, Vice President of Marketing & Creative Services.  To no surprise, he has not replied to any of the e-mails that I've sent to him.

I made one final attempt to obtain the list of alterations by writing a letter to the series creators Mike Schiff & Bill Martin via their agent (c/o Nancy Jones, Creative Artists Agency, 2000 Avenue Of The Stars, Los Angeles, CA 90067).  It's now two months since I sent the letter and I have not heard back from them, by either postal mail or e-mail.

It's rather disheartening to know that Carsey-Warner does not want to cooperate in the matter.  It's sad that they treat their fans this way.  The company makes money off of us fans, and would go out of business if none of us watched their shows and bought the related products.",1179792000,26,4793,4.950062421972534
2460842,5,B000CEXF7O,This was one of the best Christmas presents I bought this year! I can't wait to buy the other seasons!,1168646400,,102,4.15
2460843,5,B000CEXF7O,"""Grounded for Life"" is one of those sleeper hits that everybody likes but not enough people watch (evidently). On broadcast TV, ratings certainly count for more than quality as evidenced by the sad demise of this show. The characters are funny, the writing is great and the actors are superb. I really hated to see the show leave the air but I am glad to see all the seasons now being released on DVD. If you like good comedy this series is well worth owning.",1153785600,3,459,4.411764705882353
2460844,5,B000CEXF7O,"Fox gets rid of some of the best comedies and Grounded for Life is a good example of that. Fox got rid of it and then the WB picked it up just to cancel it as well. So neither stations are that smart lol. Donal Logue (Blade, The Patriot) is an a hilarious leading man as Sean Finnerty . Each weak he has to deal with a different family problem. He also has great chemestry with Megyn Price who plays his wife. The rest of the cast is fine as well. Kevin Corrigan steals the show every time he's shown as Sean's scheming brother Eddie. I get baffled to why this show was canceled every time I see re-runs on ABC Family Channel. It's funny and clever and better than most of the crappy comedies that are on now.",1147996800,3,709,4.107913669064748

2460885,5,B000CEXF7O,You are great I been buying movie from you they are so cheap.  I am suprise Grounded For Life is at a low cost.  It is my favorite show.  The reruns play on the Family Channel but I have no cable.  You are so very Beautifull Lynsey Bartilson the first time I saw Lynsey Bartilson I knew she was the one actress that was my favorite I am sorry to hear there will be no more knew episodes I will watch the movie a lot I cant wait till the other seasons come out my favorite episode is were there son gets rid of his marijuna plant there daugther is upset my favorite Lynsey Bartilson episode is were she is secretly with brad in her bed room Lynsey Bartilson is so Beautifull in that episode I was laughing a lot my name is brad so every time I her Lynsey Bartilson say that name is sweet Thank You.,1139702400,3,797,4.025316455696203

All topics are great because anyone can relate to their woes and laugh at their answers to all their quarky problems.  This show is so funny and unfortunately never got enough of the credit it so deserves.  I guarentee you will be laughing your pants off for a long time watching this show.  You will also gain a love and respect for each of the actors that appear on this show that you may or may not have seen before!  Enjoy!",1139356800,7,629,4.370689655172414
2460887,5,B000CEXF7O,"This show really is addictive.  I can give it no greater endorsement than to admit it has forced me to give up my quick naptime between work and making supper for my family so that  I can catch the back-to-back episodes each day.  I love the humor, the writing, the pace...but mostly the characters.  There is nothing cliche about this show:  it's that fresh.  My whole family laughs and talks together as we watch it (in re-runs on ABC Family).  It's a ""feel-good"" show that is almost certain to put you in a good mood.  When my DVD set arrived yesterday, my kids took turns opening it, reading about the episodes, and planning a time they could take it all in. Now, I want the remaining seasons on DVD, asap!",1139356800,4,710,4.407692307692308

I never watched it on FOX or the WB the first time around, but I caught part of an episode one day and was hooked.  The writing is incredibly funny, and the whole attitude of the show and the ""lessons"" the kids learn is similiar to those of the Connor family on Roseanne, rather than  other family sitcoms.  It was definitely cancelled before it's time, and I am so glad the DVD is finally being released!",1138579200,4,493,4.326086956521739
2460890,5,B000CEXF7O,"I recently discovered this show on ABCFamily Channel and it is so funny!  My family and I watch it everyday and sometimes rewind each episode and watch the same one over and over.  It is truly that good!  Every night while we are watching the show, we say, ""How did we not know about this show?"" and ""What were they thinking, taking it off the air?""  I can't come up with a favorite character because they are all so unique and fabulous in their own ways.  Sean is just funny, and loves to scream.  Claudia is such a fun loving and cool mom.  Lily is a time bomb.  Jimmy is intelligent but does stupid things. Henry, is well, Henry.  And Eddie, is the icing on the cake!  Trust me, this show is appealing to all age groups and to all senses of humor!  Grounded For Life is the BEST!",1137888000,5,782,4.181208053691275
2460891,5,B000CEXF7O,"I always liked this one.  It was quite a funny show whose ratings didn't reflect how good it was.  In it's rookie season, it was good, but as each season progressed, I think it got better.  My favourite character is Eddie who comes across as a dark, moody, brooding and mysterious guy, who is actually a puppy dog.  The kids are great and the parents are fun.  What this show does in each and every episode, is have flashbacks.  The story lines always have a reason to go back in time and explain how a particular situation occured.  The Finnerty's are the fun kind of family we all wish we were a part of.  Through all the teasing and fighting, you know they love each other.  This is a keeper, and I'm sorry it was cancelled.  As I said earlier; ratings don't always proove how good a show can be, and this is a classic example.  A terrific sitcom that will keep you laughing.",1137369600,31,878,4.2926829268292686
