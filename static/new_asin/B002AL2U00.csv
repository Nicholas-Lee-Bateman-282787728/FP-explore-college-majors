3886430,2,B002AL2U00,"I honestly thought someone made a mistake and put the wrong DVD in the case for Top Zen Tummy Toners. There is NOTHING tummy-toning about either workout. As the previous reviewers mentioned, the first workout incorporates very little yoga and is in fact more like aerobics - not to mention, the abs aren't worked at all but rather the legs! Conversely, the second workout IS entirely yoga, but targets the arms much more than any other body part. Furthermore, I don't ever end a yoga session without Shavasana and/or meditation. I hated the abrupt ending of Cameron Shayne's workout, and this left me feeling pissed off rather than peaceful.

The only reason I'm giving this two stars is because, despite being entirely deceptive and disappointing, these workout WILL make you sweat and burn calories. It's great cardio, but if you're looking for yoga I'd go elsewhere.

Might I suggest the Yoga & Pilates Complete Box Set from the ladies at Maya? It's two beginner DVD's - one for Yoga, one for Pilates - and two intermediate DVD's of Power Vinyasa and Pilates. I LOVE my box set - so I think I'll be sticking to that rather than trying to branch out, as I was super-disappointed by this set.",1285113600,,1193,4.70334928229665
3886431,2,B002AL2U00,"I bought this DVD hoping to trim my tummy  - but there's not a whole lot in these workouts that will help achieve that. As a beginner yogi that *has* a tummy I found both workouts extremely difficult. You will sweat. Maybe that's how they think the tum will melt away. I have some experience with Rodney's other workouts and found this one annoying because he and Mariel Hemingway seem to be team teaching. They are trying to create some sort of intimate class atmosphere, I think, and it's just not working. Let's drop the silly banter and just do some yoga. Some of the moves are distinctly *not* yoga and felt out of place. The whole workout was more aerobic in feel than yoga. Rush rush rush.... strike a pose... rush rush rush... strike a pose. I love yoga because it is gentle and flowing. This was jarring. I had never heard of Cameron before. His workout does have plank position which is about the only pose that definitely targets the advertised trouble spot. While much more yoga in feel, his workout requires a great deal of upper body strength: lots of downward dog and plank, often one after the other. If you're a yogi looking for tummy reduction I can almost guarantee you will find this DVD very difficult. I wonder what Rodney's Abs yoga DVD is like....????? Personally I have had my best tummy toning results using Ana Caban's Pilates DVDs... her Beginning Mat Workout is great as is the Body Ring Workout.",1281916800,2,1425,4.56640625
3886432,4,B002AL2U00,"TOP ZEN TUMMY TONERS contains 2 workouts that run at 18 and 26 minutes and although I enjoyed both of them if you're looking for an abs or core workout this isn't it. The title of this Giam DVD is very misleading as I never once felt my abs working during Rodney Yee's strange aerobic jumping session or Cameron Shayne's Vinyassa flow series. Boat pose, the most basic of the core poses is not preformed once nor is any other known `tummy pose' in fact there are very few seated poses at all. Due to the deceiving title I really wanted to give this a low rating but just can't because fortunately I really liked both workouts, they just weren't what I was expecting. So if your looking for 2 slightly different, shorter yoga practices with great instruction and good flow I recommend this however if your looking for an abs specific routine I would instead try RODNEY YEE'S ABS YOGA or SHIVA RHEA'S CREATIVE CORE ABS.

I started with Rodney Yee's workout although there is a `yoga matrix' type menu that allows you to preset the order you want to do the workouts in. There is also a top 10 pose guide which explains some of the basic poses in detail and shows them being preformed from different angles. Rodney's workout is different than what I'm used to from him; starting abruptly he leads a class of 4 including Mariel Hemingway from inside a studio. There is no voice over instead Rodney wears a head set and informally chats out the instruction along with Mariel. This is reminiscent of 15 Minute Results Yoga which they also instructed together and although their banter is entertaining the first time through it does tend to get annoying. We then begin with a series of knee bending arm swings, progressing into lunges, Tree pose, Warrior 2, Side stretches, Foreword bends and some more jumping exercises, ending in Childs Pose. For an abs workout I sure felt this in my legs? But it was different and got my blood flowing. The instruction although informal is easy to follow and one of the students shows beginners modifications so this is suitable for all levels.

I loved Cameron Shayne's Vinyassa flow workout, although not knowing his background I found it a little strange that he taught wearing a black belt. (I later learned he has a martial arts background.) His cuing is calming, fluid and precise and the sequence of poses just different enough to keep my interest. Again one of the 6 student's shows beginner's modifications but be aware as a beginner that you'll be holding Plank Pose (push-up) and Upward/Downward dog a lot. (I felt this abs workout in my arms) At 26 minutes this class is slightly longer and my only complaint is the abrupt ending. Shayne just states ""that's your class"" and its over without any cool down, seated poses or Savassana.

Top 10 Tummy Toners is touted to ""work your abs from every angle"" and ""create core definition like never before"" It doesn't ever achieve this but I still enjoyed these short distinct sessions. Namaste.",1260403200,19,2976,4.675572519083969

8359707,5,B002AL2U00,"I have scoliosis and as a result lots of lower back back, Cameron Shane's work out does wonders for my pain. Better than when i went to the chiropractor. As for the other work out... He is weird and says really cheesy stuff, but it is ok.",1423094400,,238,4.085106382978723
8359708,1,B002AL2U00,"I am still confused as to why this video is even for sale as it has nothing to do with toning your tummy and as for yoga videos, is a complete waste of money.  I was excited about adding this yoga video to my collection as I love Rodney Yee, but every time I play it, I have to wonder if they were just trying to fulfill some sort of video quota; it is that bad.

If you are short on time and still want to get in your daily yoga, try Rodney Yee's Power Yoga, approximately five 20 minute yoga videos or Trudie Styler's Weight Loss Yoga.  So much better than this one.",1348876800,,568,3.9649122807017543
8359709,5,B002AL2U00,"This Yoga DVD has two short workouts. The emphasis is loosely on the abdominals, though not strictly. So, I can understand other reviewer's frustration. If you want a ""abs only"" workout, Yoga is a poor choice.

The first workout is jointly hosted by Rodney Yee and Mariel Hemingway. The style is a mixture of Yoga and Aerobics. Personally, I was extremely disappointed! I have a weak ankle. I cannot do aerobics in bare feet and only briefly when wearing shoes.  What I love about Yoga is the slow movements and static positions.  This workout was completely worthless to me.

The second workout is hosted by Cameron Shayne.  I am extremely impressed with this workout! I've looked for other Yoga-only workouts by Shayne, but alas he has none yet. This workout is traditional Hatha Yoga: poses held for long periods of time.

If you want short Yoga workouts, you will get your money's worth out of Shayne's session.  If you want an intense abdominal strength building workout, look elsewhere.",1313625600,,992,4.869047619047619
8359710,1,B002AL2U00,"This DVD was a total rip off. The posture on the front isn't even in the DVD. This is not expected of GAIAM products.
In future I will make sure the product has a high rating on this website before I buy it.",1300320000,,207,3.8372093023255816
8359711,1,B002AL2U00,"I was looking for a yoga DVD that targeted the abs, and I saw this in a store and picked it up.  I really wish I had come here and looked at the reviews first.  I have another Rodney Yee DVD that I love, so I thought I would love this one too.  How wrong I was!  I agree with another reviewer that I thought they had put the wrong DVD in the box!  I kept waiting for the abs moves, and they never came.  Mostly arms and legs were targeted, and the moves were ok for that, but that's not why I picked up this DVD.  A huge disappointment.  If you are looking for a good yoga dvd targeting the abs, keep looking, this isn't it.",1297641600,,624,3.858267716535433
8359712,2,B002AL2U00,"Completly disappointed in this DVD. The only Rodney Yee video I've done that was really annoying (I own about 5 by him). Neither work-out was 20 min.,which I've noticed in other Gaiam dvds. Not only did they not focus on abs, but they specifically focussed on hips/legs, & shoulders/arms, with pretty much no ab work. My girlfriend didn't like it, so gave it to me. I am a yoga instructor, and found them to be too basic, so I'm giving it to my mother. *If it was called Short Intro to Hatha Yoga (w/ a few intermediate postures), I'd have no problem with it.",1295308800,6,559,4.384615384615385

8359714,4,B002AL2U00,"These are good workouts, but I don't feel as if they necessarily target the tummy.
At first I didn't love the one by Cameron, but when I did it again, I really liked it a lot.
If you want something by Rodney that really targets the abs try Abs Yoga for Beginners.",1289779200,3,263,4.076923076923077
