8092178,5,B000BT997A,"I bought this DVD because I long for Melvin's Bellyful to be released. This was the closest I could get to it. The soundtrack on Three Day Pass needs to be released if it hasn't been. And of course, Bellyful on DVD and the soundtrack should also be released. Both are long overdue.  I long for the day when Melvin gets a Lifetime Achievement Award from the Academy and all things Hollywood.",1275350400,7,390,4.416666666666667
8092179,5,B000BT997A,"I recently viewed this in my Black Cinema class at school, and I must say I was blown away. I usually come on here after seeing a film, to see what others had to say about it, and strangely found nothing. And I couldn't very well leave it at that. Although this film is widely unknown it seems, I'm surprised no one has anything to say, when there's so much. It's actually hard for me to exactly state why I liked this film so much. It's actually the first Melvin Van Peeble's film I've seen, so I can't really compare it to his other works. But I was completely caught off guard with this film, and I immediately had to get home to buy it online. Where to start... The acting is wonderful, and although it seems some viewers don't enjoy Peeble's editing that much, with all the jump cuts running throughout certain scenes, I found it greatly favorable, and it really added to the surreal nature of the film. If I had to describe the atmosphere, I'd have to say it's very dream-like. The imagery can get pretty out there, and some of the fantasy type sequences might throw some people off, but it really adds to the atmosphere greatly. As a whole I was grabbed and even though the ending isn't the happiest, it fits perfectly with everything. Highly reccomended to anyone.",1190073600,18,1272,4.44017094017094
