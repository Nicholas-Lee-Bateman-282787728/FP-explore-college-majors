5555787,4,B00B4TAXXK,"This DVD is a collection of eight 45 minute episodes (plus some bonus material) that details the major events and decisions of every president from George Washington to Ronald Reagan. It rather hurriedly covers the four presidents since 1989 constantly going back and forth. I wish the program had spent more time on each of them individually.

Nonetheless, this series is better than the one in 2005 (The Presidents) in that it covers major developments in American society such as the building of railroads, population growth and household innovations as well as changes to the White House and its staff.

Highly recommended!",1372377600,14,627,5.137254901960785

5555789,5,B00B4TAXXK,"""The Ultimate Guide to the Presidents"" is a three-disc DVD collection chronicling the American Presidency over the past 200 years.  Offering unusual stories, this eight-episode History Channel series provides a fresh perspective on the 44 men who have served as Commander-in-Chief, from George Washington to Barack Obama.  It concentrates on the ebbs and flows of presidential power and responsibilities as each of America's leaders deals with the events, expectations, and challenges of his time.

One of the most interesting revelations is that the Founding Fathers originally regarded the office of President as administrative, merely to rubber-stamp legislation passed by Congress.  Washington didn't want the job, but when he finally accepted it, he made the office more powerful than envisioned, setting a number of precedents, including appointing a Cabinet.

The best aspect of the series is the way the various presidents are personalized.  We get to see how each responded differently to criticism, crises, and public outcry in a job that eventually came to be labeled the most powerful position in the world.

Bonus material includes over 30 minutes of footage never before seen on TV.",1370131200,20,1196,5.4324324324324325
5555790,4,B00B4TAXXK,"When I was asked to review this new DVD series from the History Channel I thought it would be a collection of biographies of the men that have held the office of President of the United States since George Washington assumed the office on April 30, 1789.  Although, it began with George Washington and worked its way through each successive office holder, it quickly became clear to me that the focus of this new 2013 production was directed toward each man's presidential politics and how the policies of each administration ultimately shaped the role of government in its citizens lives and in the world community of nations.

Perhaps the best way to illustrate the difference in this new production is to compare it to an earlier award-winning series produced in 2005 for the History Channel entitled simply ""The Presidents"" since they appear to cover the same material.

Of course both series start with George Washington.  The 2005 documentary begins by telling us interesting little facts about George Washington, the man.  We learn he loved to dance the minuet and collect American landscape paintings.  He enjoyed interior decoration, personally decorating the interiors of his home at Mount Vernon.  He also dabbled in fashion design and designed various military uniforms.  Thomas Jefferson said he was the best horseman he had ever known and Washington's white horse was named Nelson.

We learn Washington was considered a good judge of character and not someone who simply wanted ""yes men"" advisors.  He selected the first cabinet and it was composed of really talented and experienced men including Thomas Jefferson who served as Secretary of State and Alexander Hamilton who became the first Secretary of the Treasury.  Washington met with them regularly and seriously considered their advice when making decisions.  Then, one of the professional historians interviewed for this segment very tactfully mentioned that Washington was ""accustomed to command.""  We also learn that Washington did not like to shake hands but one of the historians again tactfully explained that Washington simply felt it was beneath the dignity of the office of President.

The older program went on to tell us that Washington personally selected the site for the new capital and even personally surveyed the site.  Then we learn about Washington's declaration of neutrality when Great Britain went to war with France and, when a large number of citizens violently objected to a whiskey tax enacted by Congress, Washington led a force of 12,000 volunteers to put down the rebellion.  Lastly, much is made of Washington's willingness to lay down the responsibilities of president and peacefully return to Mount Vernon like an American Cinncinattus.

Interesting what a difference eight years makes in historical perceptions!  The new series first spends quite a bit of time explaining the context of the office of president at that time.  Congress considers itself the most important governing body and also imparts substantial strength to the judicial branch.  But the position of chief executive is viewed as someone who essentially will rubber stamp whatever legislation is ultimately sanctioned by the Congress.  Members of Congress did not initially consider giving the president veto power or control of government in any way, wishing to avoid the problems of heriditary monarchies or military-controlled empires.

As the first person to hold the office, Washington set a number precedents, including the appointment of a cabinet.  As mentioned in the first series, it is pointed out that he dislikes shaking hands but this time the historian is more frank about Washington's attitude that he felt the custom was beneath him.

The differences between the two documentaries becomes especially obvious in the discussion of Washington's second term.  When Great Britain and France declare war and Washington decides to sign a neutrality agreement, people are outraged.  Some people call Washington a traitor and Washington is burned in effigy.  Furthermore, Congress questions Washington's right to sign such an agreement since the president cannot declare war.  That is the perogative of Congress.  Washington becomes very angry because he is not only ""accustomed to command"" as it was so delicately stated in the first documentary, but he is not used to criticism or having his viewpoint challenged.
As the second term wore on, the 2013 program points out Washington became tired of the job and longed to retire to Mount Vernon.  He often appeared bored at state dinners.

His selection of the site of the new nation's capital was not without challenge either.  Several of the colonies, now states, had incurred large debts during the revolution and wanted the central government to now assume them.  Other colonies that had paid their own debts were opposed.  Washington felt strongly that if the central government was to exercise authority over all of the states, it should assume the war debts.  But to overcome the opposition he developed a compromise.  One of the largest debtors was New York, the location of the capital at that time.  The majority of colonies that did not have large war debts was in the south.  So Washington proposed that in exchange for assuming the war debts of the mostly northern colonies, the new government capital would be relocated south to its present location on the Potomac River.  I thought this was an interesting example of early political compromise.

So, I came away from my comparison wishing the History Channel had integrated these documentaries to truly produce an ""Ultimate Guide to The Presidents"".  The 2013 documentary also included more live action reenactments and tack sharp visuals as well as a more dramatic score.  At least I can recommend both productions as complementary to each other and not duplicative in scope or focus.",1365379200,95,5879,5.20403825717322

5555817,5,B00B4TAXXK,"This is one of the few historical documentaries that I've enjoyed that avoided modern political bias. It sticks strictly to facts, which align each of the presidents to their periods in American history.

In some respects the facts make this somewhat colorless. There are no tidbits about the presidents that delve into their personalities. Any mention of their character is more of a context for their actions and decisions.

The following episodes are divided among the three discs (with bonus material also included:
Assume the Position 1789-1825
Power to the People 1824-1849
A House Divided 1849-1865
Executive Retreat 1865-1901
Call of Duty 1899-1921
Changing of the Guard 1920-1945
Hail to the Chief 1945-1964
Mantle of Power 1965-2013

In addition to a succinct summary of each presidency and the issues and challenges they faced, this set is also a fast run through US (and world) history. There are some social factors for each presidency that are discussed, which is necessary, but are covered with no bias either liberal or conservative.

The older series I like because it did present some accomplishments of lesser known presidents like Chester Arthur that this one did not get into.  Although this series goes more into the White House additions and renovations than the older series.

So help me God.""

This is a great historical & detailed review of the story of the American Presidency.  I enjoyed this special, with good interviews one on one with expert historians, covering the post Revolutionary America with the era of the Founders, to John Quincy Adams and the Jacksonian era, the battle and annexation of Texas, all the way up to Lincoln and the horrors of the Civil War, then onto the post Civil War American into the guilded & industrial age of the Robber Barons and the settling of the wild old west.  They discuss the administration of Teddy Roosevelt well, with his legal Supreme Court battles to break the monopolies, and his expansion of the US Navy and expeditionary actions beyond America's borders, including the vital construction of the Panama Canal.

Later we have the trials of the brutality that defined the First World War, the social and economic suffering of the Great Depression, the era of FDR, then onto the violent struggle against Hitler's Fascism in WW2 that directly lead to the long ideological and military battle with Communism during the long era of the Cold War finally ending with Ronald Reagan & his good work to peacefully bring about the end of the Cold War.

 Then the special features the modern problems and lighting fast news media driven world of the modern Presidency (featuring Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, & Obama) , showing the good times with the bad, plus the hardships of handling the modern White House and the massive world economy with the phenomena of global outsourcing, national debt, massive recessions, political and religious ideological moral struggles here at home domestically, controlling violent crime, immigration difficulties, dealing with a Post Cold War world where Terrorists, oligarchs, and small dictatorships desperately try to obtain weapons of mass destruction to inflict harm on the innocent in the post 9-11-2001 world.

 The US Presidency is the most awesome, amazing, exciting, glamourous, profound, and powerful political and military institution ever conceived by man.  The men and their teams who are fortunate enough to get elected by ""We the People"" into the office hold the weight and fate of the most of the Earth on their hands.  Their character, principle, and charisma drive the executive office and steer the nation on a course toward either total failure, a mediocre stagnant malaise of grey, or onward to absolute triumphant victory for the ""Free World"".  It is all up to ""We the People"" with the people we elect into Congress, and that very leader we the folks select to administer the most remarkable of offices (the Oval one), and lead the greatest nation this world has ever known, the United States of America.",1422662400,,3283,5.1177570093457945

It truly is difficult to find a work that mentions all the United States Presidents without it being a mammoth multi-volume bore (except for that remaining 10% who stay with it).

This series gets a big kudos for that. It lays our nation out in chronological order with every President and his major ""hits"" (both the good and the bad) getting enough air time to plant a seed. It is narrated with just the right amount of actual photos, motion pictures, graphics, and current events of those times to make it interesting.

The negative? The incessant personal commentaries from current ""historians"" who speak as if they were there with each President, having intimate knowledge of each man's feelings about this or that issue; spewing forth big sweeping generalizations about the American people's mood---why they voted this way or that---overlaying current mores over past eras, world affairs, etc. It does get a bit old and irritating.

The Ultimate Guide to the Presidents is essentially a remake and update of History's previous presidential presentation from 2005. Like the original, this series sets out to look at every person that has been president. Through quick-paced editing interspersed with interviews from historians, each president is looked at. This includes some of their personality traits and the major events that occurred during their administrations.

The series does a decent job of covering the major events without too much detail. After all, even throughout eight forty-five minute episodes, only so much can be explained. The fast pace of the show means that it never gets boring.

My two disappointments with the series comes with their coverage of two different eras. The series mostly glosses over a few Gilded Age presidents, such as Rutherford Hayes and Benjamin Harrison, and basically writes them off as ""weak executives."" It would have been nice to see a mention of even the rather minor accomplishments of these men such as civil service reform under Chester Arthur. The other concerns the four most recent presidents. All four are given scant coverage and it almost seems like the modern era was tacked on the end of the last episode as an afterthought. This is particularly ironic when it is considered that their portraits adorn the cover of this DVD set.

In conclusion, I found this to be an interesting, if only sometimes incomplete, look at the personalities and accomplishments of the forty-four Presidents of the United States. I would recommend this to those interested in presidents or American history.",1379635200,15,1872,5.107843137254902
5555847,5,B00B4TAXXK,"I highly recommend this DVD, has a lot of history and interesting facts. It is not that details at the end after Bush Sr., goes too fast, but the previous presidents history and narration is very interesting.",1379462400,,208,4.648648648648648
5555848,3,B00B4TAXXK,"I would like to be able to speak to the content of this DVD realease only, but I am unable to get past the subtitle and description.  While our 44th president is featured prominently on the collection's cover, the subtitle and description refer to only 43 men. It appears they took the original collection, smacked a separate CD biography of Obama in with the first three, and released it as a new collection. If you have the original collection, all you need is the Obama biography to update it. There is no need to purchase the entire collection again.",1379462400,3,554,4.595959595959596
5555849,5,B00B4TAXXK,"The series is wonderful, I watched it when it was airing on the History Channel and bought it to use in my US History classroom. However, my first disc is defective. Hopefully the seller will see this review and try to replace it.",1379030400,,230,4.372093023255814
5555850,2,B00B4TAXXK,"Over the last several years I have utilized the DVD about American Presidents which provided interesting information up to Harry Truman when presenting my class.  I believed, falsely, that the Ultimate Guide would bring the American Presidents DVD up to date.  I was disappointed that Ultimate didn't accomplish this.  Having said that I would add that the material in Ultimate was useful, but not what I expected.",1375401600,2,414,5.149253731343284

8562492,4,B00B4TAXXK,"My favorite documentaries are a little slower-paced and deeper, but this is a very glossy, appealing job of presenting main ideas and some very fine film clips. The pacing is sort of restless, but all linked to the voice-overs well. The special effects help to bring a vividness and motion to scenes long past (the effect creates a sort of 3D simulated panning across and around things made of composited stills, with some color enhancement). The speakers tend to be respected historians, though the style (if key history descriptions) is more ""sound bite."" This might play well on an introductory level to the young and to the cliche attention-hopping millennials, but I enjoy it alright, and I know the underlying history. If one had to have a single source on these subjects within this short time-span, one could do a lot worse than this.",1508544000,4,842,4.854166666666667
