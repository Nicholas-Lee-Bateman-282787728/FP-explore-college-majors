8345908,3,B001VB8U8Q,"Of the 2 movies here, the Contract was more interesting and reminiscent of the Cold War times. The Glory Boys was more about the silencing of an Israeli scientist who had the secrets of the A-Bomb. An Arab and an Irishman collaborate to assassinate him. This was an okay movie but the acting left a lot to be desired, the assassins were actually the best performances. That accent that Rod Steiger was trying for? And Anthony Perkins just smirked.",1433289600,,447,4.670886075949367

The CONTRACT especially sets the mood for the times. Not in the same league as SMILEY's but quite watchable.",1277424000,,267,4.36
8345911,5,B001VB8U8Q,"THRILLER x 2 & suspense-filled spy dramas sure to keep you on the edge of your seat. Heart racing, gut wrenching. Each story is over 2  hrs long and both are written by famous thriller novelist Gerald Seymour.

The CONTRACT======================
An attempt is planned to bring Prof. Wilhelm Guttman, a Russian missile designer, out of East Germany to defect. His daughter Erica is to accompany him to rejoin with his son, Willi, thought to be dead. Henry Carter (Bernard Hepton) and Charles Mawby (James Falkner-`Bridget Jones' `First Among Equals') orchestrate the escape across the Cold War German East/West border. Johnny Donoghue (Kevin McNally-`Life on Mars' `Scoop' `Pirates of the Caribbean') is contracted to enter East Germany and escort the pair out.

His 1st job is to convince the old missile scientist to leave--to turn against his Russian country. Then the path, under heavy guard and surveillance, is considered impossible to cross. Can they make it? Of course there will be problems and set-back since this is another story written by Gerald Seymour (world renowned spy/thriller writer). A realistic portrayal of the dangerous, difficult, impossible truth to any East/West German border passage escape.
Johnny is driven toward success by a yet haunting army accident, killing a child. Another separate escape attempt is by an E. German border guard, Ulf, and his girlfriend, Jutte. For Guttman's it's about family & freedom. ""Blood is the strength of us, not flags and slogans.""

This is very believable cold War intrigue. A spy thriller the likes of which many of us saw glimpses of similar situations on TV News during the Cold War years. Less than 1 month from this story's initial TV airing, Presidents Reagan & Gorbachev signed the Cold Ward ending treaty. This German interior border conflict thriller is now more of a historical fiction DVD than originally planned. There is some violence/killing in this DVD. No subtitles.

The GLORY BOYS====================
2 assassins join in London to kill an Israeli nuclear scientist/prof (Rod Steiger-'In The Heat of the Night') soon to arrive on a visit. The assassin's codeword is `mushroom'. Famy (Gary Brown) a Palestine terrorist & McCoy (Aaron Harris), IRA from N. Ireland, are known and hunted by Jimmy (Anthony Perkins-'Psycho'), an older, graying, drinking, James Bond-type. His girl is Helen (Joanna Lumley) who is also office help for the operation's London security boss, Mr. Jones (Alfred Burke). A huge list of stars. Excellent performances by Steiger, Perkins & Burke.

The professor is also being protected by 2 accompanying Israeli bodyguards. Mrs. Sokarev (Sheila Allen), wife of the professor is not allowed to attend the London event for security reasons. It's wits against wits, nerves against nerves, and a test on who has the most to gain--or the most too loose. The success potential of protecting Sokarev or killing him seems to be equal on both sides.
A 3-part thriller that shows both sides of terrorism. ""The Glory Boys"" refers to the 2 assassins, serving for their own individual causes. When the Glory Boys made their move, the 2 get away but begin hotly pursued by Jimmy. The terror and suspense is not over by a long shot. Jimmy's lack of discipline and unreliable ways may be just what is needed under a new--now desperate--situation. The suspense seems to have no end through all the bloody tragedies. Not 007-action but a more suspenseful and believable story.
Young adult to adult due to violence and blood. No subtitles.",1270339200,6,3521,5.114782608695652
