Great gift for a music fan.",1454112000,,118,3.9583333333333335

8399231,4,B003L194DE,"There are 3 segments in this video and I like the blend of the musical aspects as well as the areas and sights associated with them. While it is not an ideal program, it is very good. There are some major parts of Europe associated with music missing and not covered here, such as arguably the most musical city in Europe, Prague where just about every major composer lived at one time or another and classical music concerts are plentiful every day, or Bayreuth with its legacy - those two stand out and come to mind immediately. Overall, however, the video is entertaining and well done.",1421884800,4,589,4.566037735849057
