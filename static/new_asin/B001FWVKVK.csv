8302836,5,B001FWVKVK,"I disagree with the written review about ""Your wife or mind"".  I know the quality of the picture id s bit off but what can you expect for the 70's.  I'm not sure I have the entire movie but I soon will.  The movie is hot and depicts what a swinging lifestyle might actually be like.",1300838400,,282,4.0
8302837,1,B001FWVKVK,"First off, let me state I LOVE good expolitation, grindhouse, Eurocult, etc., but these 3 examples of cinema sewage give Grindhouse a bad name. And, for the prices asked on Amazon, the travesty is even greater - you`d be better off donating the cash to a local Humane Society, coming home and watching porn on your computer - you`ll feel better about yourself afterwards. This crap is a TOTAL waste of time - the prints are bad, the nudity lame, the people uglier than the inhabitants of said Humane Society, and I`ll guarantee you`ll be watching w/ the fast-forward button in hand throughout all 3 movies after the first ten minutes. You`d have to be a cine-masochist to sit through this swill. If you`re looking for this type of stuff, try 'Fuego' by Something Weird Video, 'Burbank Drive In-Between The Covers/Swinging Wives' Double Feature, 'The Love Girls','The Image' by Radley Metzger,'All The Sins Of Sodom' and 'Daddy Darling' by Joe Sarno, 'Justine and Juliette', 'Luxure' by Max Pecas, or the first 4 'Black Emanuelle' films - they`re all from the late 60`s/early 70`s and deliver exactly what you`re looking for when you stumbled here by accident. You`ll thank me later, I assure you.",1266451200,13,1196,4.896551724137931
