6413513,5,B00KBIXSD2,"Its been quite a while since I was able to ejoy an action movie with a great cast and better than average acting apart from Jean Claude who I realy like but as an actor??? having said that he dosen;t have a major role. Its about a casino heist then cuts to 10 years on won't spoil the fun but its full of shooting, knifing and soforth. Great scenery to boot. Ok watch for in the credits Mr Van Dammes hair stylest. and will someone set me straight on who sings Jesus Is On The Mainline early in the film her name is Samantha ??? and any clues as to where to buy it. Enjoy tye movie I rented it then bought a copy and for $12 its now doing the rounds of my mail friends.
Cheers and enjoy Al Watts",1403049600,5,695,3.9361702127659575

6413517,1,B00KBIXSD2,"I read some of the reviews here, seemed positive, so gave it a try.  Absolutely reprehensible--not a single character worth sympathizing with (with the slight exception of the sheriff in his own predictable role), a plot so overworked it could tell itself (and do a better job)--even the clich's were clichs of themselves--just about no redeeming qualities whatsoever.  Mean, vicious, sick, stupid.  Good actors gone bad.  Do not waste your money on this one--represents pretty much all that is wrong with modern society, and just doesn't seem to care even a little bit.",1463356800,,570,5.096774193548387
6413518,4,B00KBIXSD2,"Jean-Claude Van Damme does an amazing job as a very complex villain/point of view character in this modern drama about crime in the southwest USA.

6413519,4,B00KBIXSD2,"Being a Van Damme fan, I just had to watch this film, even though, to my disappointment, he has but a small role. I did end up liking the film, though; good action, interesting plot (a nice twist to the usual bank robbery storyline), decent writing, and the story moved along well, for me that is, I also found the flashbacks were done in the proper manner - flashbacks are a complete nightmare in some movies, confusing the daylights out of viewers - but to me in this movie the flashbacks were handled properly, you just have to pay close attention to the beginning and listen to all the dialogue. I also liked the old western ""feel"" to it, that was cool. I really don't have any major complaints about the movie, just a few minor things that stood out for me or didn't quite work for me, some of which were also noted by other reviewers, such as the heat - not that it really mattered, plot wise, I mean, but the heat is mentioned through out the film, but I felt that I was not convinced of how hot it was. I live in the Caribbean, so I know HOT, and SWELTERING heat; people gasping for air, wiping sweat off their foreheads and necks, sweat stains under the armpit, chest and back areas, people sighing with relief as they walk into an air-conditioned building, and so forth - that ""shows"" HOT - and I just didn't see that ""consistently"" through out the film. There were a few scenes that showed how hot it was - the inmates in the church with sweat stains on their clothes, just before the gang blow a hole in the wall and free their leader, for instance. And they do establish the temperature at the beginning of the film (perhaps to ""explain"" the title of the movie, Swelter) when they show the sheriff sitting in his car listening to the weather forecast on the radio, but that made me question how hot it was because he's sitting in his car with the window open (instead of closed and the air conditioner on) and wearing too many garments; a jacket, long-sleeve denim shirt and a tank top underneath all that, which is what he usually wears through out the film, and so do other characters - way too much clothing to hang out in 100+ degree weather, yikes!  So that didn't quite work for me. I also did not quite understand the sheriff's girlfriend (who, by the way, turns out to be the ex of the gang's leader) who knew all along the sheriff's true identity (he lost his memory due to an injury to his brain during a casino heist) but never told him, and towards the end of the movie, she just tells him that she was afraid that if she told him who he was, he would find the money and leave - I'm not too sure how that works, but...Also, the doctor who saved his life (with a head wound, he somehow makes it to the doctors office miles away from the casino) seems to know about him as well, but doesn't tell him anything either. And the third scene I was not sure about either was the scene towards the end of the film that shows a confrontation inside a building with the sheriff, the gang leader and his last surviving buddy who has a gun trained at the sheriff and is ready to shoot him, at this point the unexpected happens when the gang leader shoots his buddy thus saving the sheriff's life, then the gang leader walks out the door and into the street, takes a few steps when he notices the sheriff is right behind him, following him, and perhaps the gang leader sees this as a challenge to a showdown - old western style! They shoot it out and one gets killed but at this point it is still unclear to me as to the gang leader's reason for saving the sheriff's life a moment earlier.
For those who are not familiar with the storyline, or didn't read the description, it's basically about 5 men who rob a vegas casino, one of them gets shot during their escape, and the others get caught during the escape, the one who got injured manages to make it to another town where he finds a doctor and a female who end up saving his life, but he experiences memory loss due to the head injury, unable to remember his past, the heist, or the money or where he hid the money. Ten years later, they show the gang (2 of which received 9+ years in prison, the 3rd escaped from prison, and the 4th, their leader, got life), getting back together and are ready to free their leader from prison so that they can track down their buddy who they believe has the millions they stole from the casino. Their buddy, by the way, became sheriff and has a totally different life and is a totally different person, so he doesn't seem to care about going back to his old ways, and he can't remember where he hid the money anyway, so not much he can do about it.
Like I said, I enjoyed this film; good storyline, interesting characters, nice ending - though I'll always wonder what will happen to the money, if it will ever be found by anyone, or if the sheriff will ever remember where he left it...in a place where it could be easily found, if anyone would just bother to look.",1458345600,3,4967,4.289669861554845

6413529,3,B00KBIXSD2,"Once you get past the disjointed beginning of the film it evens out to a fair action flick.  Jean Claude Van Damme is there for the name, his part is minor.  Grant Bowler plays the best role as the escaped convict leader of the gang.  The storyline deals with a gang who has robbed a casino in Las Vegas ten years ago.  All were captured but one who escaped with the money with a bullet in his head.  The wound robbed him of his memory and he doesn't remember his past or what he has done with the money.  The gang is out now and coming to his town for the money.  He is now the sheriff of the town.  Lennie James is totally miscast as the sheriff.  Good premise, but not developed well.

6413538,3,B00KBIXSD2,"Swelter(released April/14)stars,among others, Jean-Claude Van Damme,Josh Henderson, Brad Carter, Alfred Molina and  Lennie James. Swelter is not too bad of a film about crime,its consequences and ultimate redemption. JVCD may be the bigger name,but he is merely a cog in a much larger wheel.
The story finds a group of heist men relieving the RIO hotel in Vegas of a LOT of its takings,10 years before the current date;$10 million worth. During the escape James is shot in the head, while their leader Bowler is captured and sent to prison. The money goes missing. The Vegas police never found Bowler, as he was befriended by Molina,a doctor and spirited away. He took Bowler to Baker,a dusty old town in the the middle of Death Valley. Bowler eventually became town sheriff,with no memory of his past.
Fast forward and as the film begins Bowler is getting busted out during a ride in a prison bus,by the rest of the gang which includes JCVD.JCVD's character has had enough of the criminal life and wants out,once the missing money is found. There is a lot of interplay/bickering between gang members and Bowler has to take a tight reign on his posse. Through the grapevine the group has learned that Baker might be their target town. They drive there and find James,who has no memory of any of them. Bowler also finds that his ex girlfriend is currently shacking up with James,and is not pleased.
The group slowly but surely start to make trouble by starting fights and eventually murders one of the sheriff's deputies and the doctor. One day,with the sheriff as hostage,the group tell the whole town what the back story of the group is and Jame's involvement. They tell the people to either find their $10million dollars by the next morning or the sheriff will die and the town will burn to the ground. Immediately the scared townsfolk figure the money is in the Church and burn it down.
Jame's girlfriend,knowing that he never carries a gun,digs under some floorboards to find the gun he used in the original RIO heist. She has known of his past all along. James uses it to confront Bowler and Bowler lies dead on the ground,in a High Noon-ish style shoot out. Bowler is ready to head out,knowing the townspeople now know of his past. However they rally around him and will dispose of all the bodies in an old abandoned silver mine out of town. As the film ends the camera pulls back and up to reveal the hidden location of the lost millions...in the long dry wooden water tower.
The film is a smartly done film where a lot of the film's plot is told progressively in back story. The film is also shot in a sepia tone to give the town of Baker an even more desolate look and feel. As I mentioned JCVD is just another cog in the big wheel and he is killed about 3/4 the way through. He plays his character ably but he is outshone,due to a lack of screen time,by his cohorts like Molina,Bowler and James. The latter two especially are the real stars of this one. Speaking of JCVD,he has me worried. In the extra section there is a rare interview with him. I know he is battling bi-polar disease,but whether that and his meds are wearing him down,I do not know. But he looked and acted tired and distracted,and was rambling,not finishing his sentences. He talks of his bad English and pronunciation. Funny enough I have found in his more recent film this HAS become an issue. You really have to strain sometimes to understand him. I never found that to be the case say six or more years ago. He says he just returned from France and was getting used to speaking English again, and that the producers were patient with him. It seems the older he gets the less proficient at it he is. The total opposite of what you would think should be happening. Hmmm.
Technically speaking the film is in its 1:85:1 w/s a/r and is clear and crisp. Extras include interviews with most of the main cast.
All in all a nicely done heist film and the mystery surrounding a missing $10 million. JVCD is the big name but the other cast members are the ones who really shine. 3 1/2-4 stars.",1416096000,,4066,4.547066848567531

The Kane character was skeevily (I apologize if I misspelled, though I don't think it's a real word anyway so it shouldn't matter) creepy but not over the top and Josh Henderson's Boyd was hotly smoldering at all times.

The movie moved along at a  nice pace and had enough character development of the townspeople that you had some what of a connection to them. The underlying theme is about redemption and whether it is attainable for different characters.  It is also about a small dying town and the question of whether it is worth saving. There is a lot of killing but it is not really that gory. The acting was decent with exception of the woman playing the girlfriend.

The bad guys were definitely bad, but quite stupid. They got caught because of this and then ten years later they go around brazenly gunning down anybody who gets in their way. The idea that these acts will most certainly get them caught again doesn't seem to enter their minds.

In reference to another reviewer's comments, I didn't find the flashbacks confusing.  What was interesting was were the money ended up being, considering Pike was near dead when he was found, I doubt seriously there was anyway he could of placed it there.",1408320000,6,1235,4.616438356164384

8657350,3,B00KBIXSD2,"Swelter, a movie titled so because the small desert town of Baker where most of the events take place is supposed to be unbearably hot.  Although being so you'd think the characters who live there and the fugitives who come to town would dress with less clothing, wear shorts instead of long leather pants, take off jackets which you can't imagine anyone in that temperature would even put on in the first place, and so forth.  Although Van Damme is the main guy on the DVD cover, he is only a minor character and spends most of the little screen time he has sitting at the town's bar. If you were after his leg raised beating up people with his foot stuff he's famous for.  He doesn't do any of that sort of thing in Swelter. The main two characters are played by actors best known for their minor character roles in later seasons of The Walking Dead and True Blood.  Lennie James (Morgan Jones on TWD) plays a guy now known as Bishop, he has some bullet shrapnell in his head that could move at any time and kill him.  He can't remember his past but has somehow knowing he could die for a drunk's wild punch or a guy shoving him trying to avoid arrest, become sheriff of Baker. Police obviously don't undergo background checks over there when they join the force.  Bishop doesn't carry a gun, and accepts no nonsense in his town.  His biggest problem until the bad guys come to town is his girlfriend's teen daughter not respecting him and not liking when he lays down rules about drinking and hanging out with boys in the town.

The other main character Cole, a guy who gets broken out of prison, is played by New Zealander Grant Bowler (best known to audiences outside of Australia as Cooter in seven episodes of True Blood) He was also the host of The Amazing Race Australia during its short life, as well as The Mole, and the narrator for an airport baggage show called Nothing to Declare.  Cole and his former Vegas robbery gone bad crew are on the run and hiding out in Baker after blowing away a trail of law enforcement officers in their wake, where they just happen to hear the name of the local sheriff and decide to start a bar fight with some Indians to get a look at him.  Later in the film they will tell the town, that he used to go by a former name so this makes little sense, but that's what happens. I also can't work out how the doctor (a.k.a. town drunk) knew who the sheriff used to be. Or why no one found the ten million dollars when it's revealed where it is, nor how it wasn't ruined by rain which must have happened shortly after it was put there or else a thick trail of blood would have led curious eyes to it.

It's a decent watch even if it has some holes.  There is occasional humour every now and then, such as the drunk doctor guy when doing something shady behind his surgery notices a potential patient approach and tell him he's booked out today and come back later, the guy turns around and has the back half of an arrow sticking out his back and starts walking off with his son beside him. Then the doctor tells him, oh hang on, yeah just go wait in the waiting room I'll be with you in a few minutes.",1497744000,,3141,4.278246205733558
