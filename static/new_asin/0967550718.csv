7794018,1,0967550718,One of the least informative exercise videos I've ever encountered. Do not waste your time or money on this.,1138579200,,108,4.7368421052631575
7794019,5,0967550718,"In my opinion, this video is as close as you can get to having a personal trainer without actually having to pay for one. Raphael Picaud gives you excellent tips and demonstrations on how to properly weight train. For most people who don't know much about form or technique this video will be quite enlightening. I thought I knew how to lift weights (seems simple enough, right?), but I never really got the results I wanted. After watching this video, I put the techniques to use and I got excellent results, quite immediately. It's also great for preventing injuries and muscle strain. I highly recommend this video for anyone who wants to learn how to work out the right way.",990576000,30,678,4.658333333333333
7794020,2,0967550718,"I envy the reviewer who gets to work out with this guy--I imagine he knows his stuff and would be great in person.  However, for me it did not translate to the video and I have been unable to get much assistance from the video.  Learned some items about proper form for lifting, but I really think this is the kind of thing that can only be learned with an actual trainer watching you and giving you comments.  There is a reason people have coaches for just about any sport...you cannot really evaluate yourself and you need someone watching you to give you this type of information.  At this point I cannot affort a trainer, but I also wish I hadn't spent the money on this video and had instead put it toward a live training session.",990057600,12,735,4.343065693430657
7794021,5,0967550718,"I have the pleasure & good fortune to work out 3 times a week with the most talented, skilled & dedicated fitness trainer, Raphael Picaud. I also use his amazing video as a refresher to help me better understand and fine tune my technique & form in weight training. The easy to follow & informative video works for Everyone! It's great as an intro for beginners & and helps those who have made a commitment to health & fitness get the MOST out of their workout. It's a wonder that it took so long for someone to put all of this great info in one place!? I guess it just took the right person. Thanks Raphael!!!!",984268800,9,611,4.275862068965517
7794022,5,0967550718,"I read about raphael Picaud in in style magazine ,and bought his books and tapes at maxxfit.com .  Although I exercised for years , this tape really showed me what I need to do at the gym .  How to do it .  And if I cannot go to the gym , he makes me practice at home .  It s so good , i came back to order some for all my stockings this christmas .  It s the gift of health, that will go right next to the chocolate , and the bonbons.
You ll enjoy this genuine exiting man .",976320000,8,475,3.5728155339805827
7794023,5,0967550718,"This is a GREAT video, particularly for individuals with a longer term, preventative focus on fitness and health.  Unlike most videos I've used, it doesn't emphasize quick (and in my opinion unrealistic) results.  Rather,  the emphasis of the video is on educating individuals to understand (and  not merely mimic) the basic movements and principles underlying weight  training and plyometric exercise.
In the tape, Raphael Picaud explains  the basic movements underlying exercises for the back, chest, arms, abs,  and legs.  He's very engaging without being irritating.
In my view, a  really positive thing about the tape is that you can really do the  exercises with or without equipment.  In fact, I think this is an  especially good tape for learning proper weight training techniques,  especially if the weight room is a scary and foreign place for someone.  In  this way, it may be best to watch the tape BEFORE going to the gym and to  rewatch it occasionally.
I'd also mention that the musical soundtrack of  the tape is really good.  Not cheesy. Also, it is helpful that the tape is  shot in both black and white and color to indicate when a viewer can follow  along versus just watch.
In short, I'd recommend this fitness video.  It's no nonsense and I felt I learned a lot.",960681600,24,1284,4.851851851851852
