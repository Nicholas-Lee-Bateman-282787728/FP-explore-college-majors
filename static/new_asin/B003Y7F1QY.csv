8408869,4,B003Y7F1QY,"Too Hot To Handle shows burlesque from the 1950's and it makes for interesting viewing as in its day, it would have been seen as rather naughty, but by our standards, it's fairly tame. I suspect it could run on network television unedited and the only complaints might come from the fact that it's in black and white. There are beautiful women doing striptease (although this being the 1950's, no one goes stark naked or even topless).  One of them, Dixie Evans, has a passing resemblance to Marilyn Monroe.  She does her routine on a set resembling a producer's office, and it occurred to me that this was a likely fantasy of many men of that time.  There are also some comedy sketches.  While much of the humor is on the same level as what one might hear in middle school, there is a piece about mathematics that is actually quite clever and I had to admire the thought that went into it.  If you are curious about what people would have found sexy some 60 years ago, Too Hot To Handle is a nice little time capsule.",1343260800,14,1018,4.3936170212765955
