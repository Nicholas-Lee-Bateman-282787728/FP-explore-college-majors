3701515,3,B001MVYUSE,"This is a decent Sci-Fi Gore-Fest that while extremely derivative, is able to keep one's attention. Other reviewers have provided a plot synopsis, so I shall keep this one short. SCREAMERS: THE HUNTING, blends elements from; the ALIEN quadrilogy, PHANTASM and the TERMINATOR franchise, to name a few. While the viewer is keenly aware of this mix, the film proved to be entertaining with its blend of explicit gore and Sci-Fi action. Yes, Gore Hounds take note, as this second helping dishes it out in fine form. Two decapitations are witnessed within the first six and a half minutes, (the credits are still rolling), while other assorted coring, slicing and dicing, weave their way through the film, (as well as through many of the actors). Veteran Lance Henrickson who unfortunately played only a minor role, supported a competent cast who played it straight. The SFX are surprisingly well done and keep the project rolling with a reasonable budget feel until its predictable end. On that note I must say that we have seen all of this before and there are NO surprises here, save for the credible and refreshing effects work which detail bio-mechanical organisms that hunt humans! There are also those seemingly obligatory plot holes that pervade such films & keep us up at night asking ""why""???... Nonetheless, many Gore Hounds will want this for their DVD library not only for its splatter appeal, but also for the welcome change that the Sci-Fi setting provided for the carnage that ensued. A fair to good outing, just don't expect anything too cerebral. Worth giving it a spin, especially if blood n' guts is your ""thing""! A comfortable **1/2 to *** Stars effort.",1241654400,9,1669,4.921985815602837
3701516,2,B001MVYUSE,".......At this idiotic mess of a movie.  ""Screamers-The Hunting"" is the long awaited sequel to the original 1996 ""Screamers"".  The wait wasn't long enough. Essentially just an excuse to show how many ways the screamers,small robotic buzzsaws, can cut,hack and mutilate anything in its path. The plot such as it is involves a distress signal from planet Sirius 6b. I thought Sirius was where Howard Stern broadcasts from. To add to the merriment a meteor storm is heading to Sirius in 6 days to obliterate the planet.  In spite of the planets impending doom a group of astro-nuts(misspelled on purpose)head to the doomed planet to investigate the distress signal. Several in the party are slaughtered almost immediately and the rest head back to their ship to leave.  Too late, the screamers have emptied their fuel cells. So they venture out again looking for fuel cells on a seemingly empty planet except for the buzzsaws. To cut to the chase they end up in a cave where they meet up with a group of ""survivors"" and blah blah blah, but they learn the screamers have evolved into even human form.  One of the ""survivors"" attracts the attention of one of the astro-nuts and soon they find a grotto in the cave where they make love.  Hmmmm--remember the screamers can pass as human-hmmmm-wonder if this is going to lead to a surprise ending?  Hmmmm-I don't want to insert a spoiler here but just imagine--everyone else eventually gets hacked-up and only the love-making duo escape just as the meteor shower hits the planet. After 45 days in hibernation the female realizes she is about to give birth and her companion, the daddy, is a SCREAMER.  GASP!  The End.

The movie is not boring but the bottom line is-it sucks.",1239667200,7,1717,4.77027027027027
3701517,4,B001MVYUSE,"Screamers came out back in 96 and was a huge success on many levels. Adding special Effects with good acting and a great Sci-Fi tale of terror. The Hunting is a sequal that lives up to the original.

A Team of Soldiers Respond to an SOS on a planet thought to be un-inhabited. But they find that there is a civillian presense on Serius 6B as well as a dark secret from the past that has been biding its time to exact its revenge.

The story is nothing new to sci-fi and acting is moderate, however the Special Effects stand out the most due to thier Suprising Detail. most straight to DVD films lack good effects, not so with this one.",1235692800,,635,4.239669421487603
3701518,1,B001MVYUSE,"The only way Screamers: Hunting could be mistaken for anything but a bad bad bad bad flick is if your television set was broken, all you heard was the audio and you suffered from narcolepsy. It made Chupacabra: Dark Seas look like a masterpiece. I watched it in the hopes it would get better and that hope died a lingering agonizing death.

If you like wasting your time and you can't find anything else in the video store, like Barney & Friends knock yourself out. Misery loves company.",1235606400,2,487,4.534090909090909
3701519,3,B001MVYUSE,"""Inspired by a short story by visionary author Philip K. Dick"" - Only if he was on a bad acid trip when he wrote the story. I recommend that people should read the original short story, its very good.

Anyway, this film is the sequel to the decent ""Screamers"" film, in which Peter Weller stars as a soldier trapped on a planet filled with ""crazy killer robots"" that dice people up like, well, homicidal robots. The plot twist is that the murderous machines are mutating, becoming more human. Yup, the sequel is another a crazy killer robot film. This time a bunch of victims, er, soldiers land on the planet in response to a distress signal. Chop, chop, chop...

For gore fans, there are many scenes where people get torn up by the crazy killer robots. The rescue team makes the usual stupid mistakes that are typical for films of this type and are soon on the run from the C.K.R. There is a plot twist, not a very clever one, and Lance Hendricksen shows up for some reason near the end (I guess Peter Weller was busy).

Screamers The Hunting is just what you think it is - a direct to video horror film. Similar in quality to the Starship Troopers sequels, this film is not horrible but don't expect much.",1234569600,17,1206,4.423423423423423

I give it points for over-the-top gore and good ol' Lance but otherwise, the plot was weak, the rookie actors (I'll be nice) did their best but the script irritated me the most. Whoever wrote it knows very little of human reaction and response and relies on flat, ill-fleshed-out stereotypes when it comes to character creation. I can forgive the CG. Not too bad for the budget. Props and mechanics were a bit obvious in their inauthenticity. Points for gore. The director and makeup staff put more heart into that, so... I bought it so my critique is more observant than meant as an attack. I'm a fan of Screamers so it made sense for me to complete the collection.",1405036800,2,712,4.5271317829457365

3701552,1,B001MVYUSE,"(1.) Loaded with bad science, bad acting, bad dialogue, bad or stereotyped CGI and modeling. Didn't I see that space craft at my toy store with the same blue light  LED propulsion. The spacecraft landing on the dusty planet was like it was landing on a kitchen counter.
(2.) Borrowed heavily from Aliens, Predator, Tremors. Usual story of abandoned mining planet with human made machines turned anti-human. The Tremors like burrowing through the ground/rocks was just dumb. Anyway, for some reason humanity sends a crew to some distant star to rescue one person that at any foreseeable future speed should have taken centuries (and cost billions) but in our film just takes two months.
(3.) Acting? They could have used any warm body and done better. Usual Hollywood (in this case Canadian film industry supported by their tax dollars) crew of self serving male; attractive females (in shorts); African Canadian (who should have had a more important and non-stereotypic role).
(4.) Alien planet landscape looked suspiciously like Utah or Arizona but was Alberta (just north of Glacier Park, MT). Seen one desert - seen them all (well, somewhat).
Alien planet gravity and atmosphere were suspiciously Earth like. Cheap and not too creative.
(5.) Predictable, and poorly implemented, ""Aliens"" type ending of female astronaut returning to Earth with alien goodies.

Not a bad movie.  Acting is decent, special effects are okay, and the plot, although predictable and very cliche is okay.

basically, if you are in need of a sci-fi fix and are Jonesin pretty bad, then this will do in a pinch to get you through your rough patch until you can score some major sci-fi.

To be honest, there are better movies out there of this type, this one is on the meh side, but it is watchable.  Unlike some of the crap like Maverick films of Asylum, that crap is 100% unwatchable.

Alot of cool gore and the speical effects aren't too bad. Highly entertaining and recommend watching it.",1277856000,2,447,4.149425287356322
3701558,4,B001MVYUSE,"The official Amazon.com review here isn't totally fair to the director or this movie.  This is actually very high quality for a direct-to-video release.  The cinematography is good, the special effects are competent, the dialogue is no worse than any Jerry Bruckheimer movie I've seen in the last five years, and the acting is actually quite good.  (No one was ever going to win any Oscars for being in this movie, but seriously, all the performances here are on a par with Judi Dench in Chronicles of Riddick.  It's not the actor's fault if he doesn't seem entirely believable while he's getting torn in half by a robot - they do the best they can with the movie they're in.)

The script is also better than your average SyFy channel fare.  It has a number of really good ideas, not all of which are stolen from other movies (though some of them are).  There's a very well-developed theme here of corruption, for instance, about what can lead a character to make colossally bad decisions.  The script does have some weak points, though, and those generally come in the form of colossally bad decisions by the main character that aren't sufficiently motivated, that are just there to advance the plot.  If those had been ironed out in order to get from point A to B to C and so on without causing the viewer to lose respect for the protagonist, this movie would definitely have been worthy of a theatrical release.  As it is, it's still worth two hours of your time.

I haven't actually seen the first Screamers, by the way, but I'm definitely going to check it out after seeing this one.

P.S. This movie has a slight identity crisis when it comes to who it thinks its audience is.  It has some pretty aggressive gore, so not all sci-fi fans will be totally happy with that.  At the same time, it's not scary enough to be a horror movie by any stretch, and the amount of gore is nowhere near enough to keep hardcore splatter-film lovers interested.  If you're a sci-fi fan who thought that scene in Scanners where the guy's head explodes was pretty boss, then you'll probably like this movie.",1276473600,3,2093,4.5588235294117645
3701559,4,B001MVYUSE,Very good B movie. The pace is good. Story is very good. No non-sense screenplay. This movie is very very similar to Aliens. Not bad.,1269216000,,133,4.36

If you are a Philip K. Dick fan you will want to see this sequel to the original film ""Screamers,"" an adaptation of one of his stories, just so you can say that you've seen 'em all, but otherwise there isn't much merit to this film, unless you really enjoy decapitations and general blood soakings.  Whenever someone stuck out his/her head we all ducked and made ""Ewwww"" noises.

  But, I have to say that my family thought it was an OK way to pass the evening.  What did we expect?  We had seen the original screamers and actually liked it.  The combination of PKD and Peter Weller was irresistible.  Weller always brings a certain edginess to his characters; a certain hint of depths, much to his credit.  There were a few interesting cast moments in this sequel, but mostly we just passed the time trying to identify who was fulfilling which cliche role (i.e., expendible, whiner, hero, etc).

  Having said all that, we have seen so many movies of this kind that didn't even have a plot that could be followed, and we could follow this storyline just fine.  So that is a plus.",1266710400,4,1382,4.485943775100401

3701566,2,B001MVYUSE,"I honestly had no idea that there was any sort of demand for a sequel to Screamers.  A mid-90s sci-fi/horror film based on a story by Philip K. Dick and starring genre mainstay Peter Weller, the original Screamers was an underrated film, and still is to this day.  That's one reason why I was kind of surprised at a sequel, even a direct to DVD sequel at that.  Screamers: The Hunting picks up a dozen or so years after the events of the original film, with a team being dispatched back to the planet the first film took place on after receiving a distress call to rescue survivors before the planet is bombarded by a meteor shower.  Before you can say mincemeat, the bullets, limbs, and blood flies.  It should be noted right away that the best thing that Screamers: The Hunting has going for it are some pretty good, and gross, gore effects.  Other than that, there's terrible acting and even worse dialogue on display, gaping plot holes and leaps in logic, and times where the film's shoestring budget becomes painfully apparent.  Still, what else would you expect from a direct to DVD sequel to a cult (at best) sci-fi flick from the mid-90s?  All in all, if you're a fan of the original Screamers, you should definitely give Screamers: The Hunting a look, even if you can safely assume that what you're getting is basically the equivalent to some one else's spare parts.",1242345600,2,1375,4.583673469387755

The rest of the team slogs their way through a bleak landscape, watched every step of the way, until they find a convenient place to spend the night.............the supposedly abandoned factory where the Screamers made themselves.  And thats when we learn that the Cmdr. (Greg Bryk) has ulterior motives for being there, the lieutenant (Gina Holden as Victoria Bronte) is hiding her familial connection to the lead character in the first film, and that most of these soldiers are inept whiners you don't want to turn your back on.  As expected, they start losing members, the so-called safety tags don't always work, and the survivors aren't everything they claim to be.  And then up pops Lance Henriksen for a brief moment, wasted in a do-nothing role that I hope he was well paid for.  Such a shameless waste of talent.
