2205253,5,B00078JZ74,"Ashutosh Gowariker has produced another masterpiece!  Swades is a story of Mohan Bargava (Shah Rukh Khan) a Project Manager working for NASA in Washington. Bargava feels guilt at neglecting Kavariamma, who he considers his second mother, and goes to India seeking her.  In the short time he is there, he sees the underlying problems of village life and is instrumental in implementing some changes.  With the help of two men from different castes, he brings the children of different castes together to attend school, and engage the villagers when providing electricity for the village.  Mohan Bargava is in the middle of a project at NASA.  Will he succeed in bringing Kavariamma with him to the US?  Will the girl he fell in love with return with him?  Will he be able to give up living what is considered a good life, having all the comforts one can possibly want through a high-paying job at NASA, and relocate to India where he can use his knowledge and skills to improve village life!  Will nostalgia for his native land prompt his decision?  The film denotes a certain freedom in living a simple life, and a definite satisfaction when giving of one's self!  Playing the role of Mohan Bargava, SRK portrays a range of emotions, expressions and mannerisms that are as natural and distinctive of him.  His ability to mimic the mannerisms of another is interestingly funny and comes through in the film...at least I thought so!  The movie is entertainingly heartwarming and soul-searching, with a desire to follow a calling, a chosen path!  Watch this blockbuster movie to see what life changing decisions will be made.  It's a film on humanitarian needs that I believe, calls to every educated person!  Although SRK is phenomenal in ""Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi"" and amazing in ""Bhadshah"" I've watched this one the most!  After two attempts at purchasing the DVD, I am happy to have this bonus package!  It contains two disks.  Disk 1 is the feature film and disk 2 has special features such as the making of the film, actors' interviews and deleted scenes which, in my opinion, should have been included in the film and other minor parts deleted.  The film is long enough but it would have been worth it.  I am very pleased to have both disks!",1361404800,3,2240,4.739018087855297
2205254,4,B00078JZ74,"The acting was a little cheesy at the beginning and when the movie took place in the US.  But in India, I thought there were several good themes.  Poverty, discrimination, injustice, romance to name  a few.  I liked watching how ShahRuchKhan's character changed as he visited his homeland.",1358553600,2,289,4.958333333333333
2205255,4,B00078JZ74,"""Swades: We, the People"" stars Shahrukh Kahn. The hero is working at NASA as a project manager. He has been very successful in the United States. He returns to India to find his nanny with the intention of bringing her back to the United States and taking care of her. He finds her in a village. The nanny is part of a small group which is trying to modernize the village. At first the hero just wants to get his nanny to leave with him. Over time he comes to care about the village and starts working to improve it.

Shahrukh was also in ""Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi"" and ""Chak de India"" both of which I greatly enjoyed.",1349827200,,613,4.151260504201681
2205256,4,B00078JZ74,"I agree with Z.B.'s review in all respects, and only give Swades 4 stars because (in my personal opinion) the soundtrack is not absolutely top-notch, and because of one particular problem I have with the script--that Shah Rukh's NASA dialogues and tech-talk are painfully unrealistic and contrived.

But in all other respects I find Swades a warm and memorable effort. Shah Rukh Khan doesn't have the most enormous range, but neither is his talent small or insignificant. And here his usual focus and commitment to the role--not to mention his personal charisma, which really is off the scale--make you empathize with his character, and with the not-modern-and-booming India that you see through his eyes. Gayatri Joshi as his love interest and as sort of the counsel for the defense of India is so warm, natural, and unaffected that you will want to see more of her by the film's end--and you will remain disappointed, because Swades was her *only* film.

Swades is not perfect as a whole, but it is memorable for parts of it. If you have empathy and compassion, you will want to see it at least twice.",1321488000,2,1103,4.8
2205257,5,B00078JZ74,"I'm pleased to offer my first ever review for a film. Thanks to Slumdog Millionaire I've taken to watching films set in India, directed by and made for folks from there, and this is among the best of just 20 or so I've seen thus far. Excellent acting and character development (we care for the characters), several good musical scenes - not at all campy or tacky. The fact that this is from India is really irrelevant. It's just a wonderful film about the power of love.",1311465600,2,470,4.413793103448276
2205258,5,B00078JZ74,"A worth watching Movie by Ashutosh Gowariker.

Leaves a impression on mind after you have seen the movie.

Though there are technical faults in the storyline yet those can be left aside on the backdrop of a heart-touching theme. A theme for the people who are leaving their countries / states in search of a better life without realising the fact that they can create a better living environment at home itself.

An insight on the problems of India whose underdeveloped part is somehow or other responsible for itself for the underdevelopment. The social jinx in the rural India which should have been broken long before are now hampering the progress of the villages.

The movie is another Gem after Lagaan in the collection of Ashutosh and Indian Cinema as a whole.

Great Job by Shahrukh. Exquisite appearance by Gayatri. Grand Show by Ashutosh.",1304380800,,848,4.861111111111111

2205260,3,B00078JZ74,"Indian NASA scientist Mohan (played by Shahrukh Khan) feels lost and alone in his life in the U.S., so he returns to India to find his beloved elderly nanny and bring her home with him. During his visit to her village, he is deeply affected by the social ills he sees there. This isn't the rosy picture of India found in most Bollywood films and it pointedly criticizes the oppressiveness of the caste system. Mohan comes to care about the villagers, finds ways to help them, and challenges them to help themselves. And he falls in love with his childhood friend, Gita (Gayatri Joshi), who runs the local school. The movie celebrates what's wonderful about Indian life without ignoring its flaws and likewise shows what's missing in America while championing its values of equality. The plodding pacing and the stiff interaction between Mohan and Gita mar this otherwise fine film. While Khan won accolades for his performance, the dynamic actor is better suited to less subdued roles. - The Bollywood Ticket: The American guide to Indian movies (Subscribe:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Bollywood-Ticket/dp/B002Q0WPWS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Bollywood Ticket</a>)",1254009600,,1220,5.672131147540983

So, Mohan Bhargava (Shahrukh Khan) is an NRI, a Non-Resident Indian. Mohan is busy living the American dream in Washington, D.C., residing in cushy digs and fostering a thriving career as a NASA engineer. And his request for U.S. citizenship has just been approved. Yet, something is missing in Mohan's very good life. On the latest anniversary of the death of his parents, he fondly recalls his nanny, who had raised him and is the last living tie to his parents. On a whim, Mohan goes on vacation to visit his beloved nanny in India. It's a decision that will change his life...

SWADES is a good movie, a really good movie, and directed by Ashutosh Gowarikar, who made the awesome epic Lagaan - Once Upon a Time in India. And, like LAGAAN, SWADES is more than your standard Bollywood fluff. Both pictures have things to say about their native country, and both pictures say these things well. SWADES is not as dramatic or as excitingly paced as LAGAAN, and not as filled with cinematic thrills (SWADES, for one thing, doesn't have the sport of cricket to drive the plot). And yet, for all of its more than three hours of running time, SWADES does not ever stop being immensely watchable and moving.

While LAGAAN hearkens back to a time in the past and recalls an event in which India's rustic natives were able to beat the English at their own game, SWADES tries for a more modern form of patriotism. Mohan Bhargava, as mentioned, is a non-resident Indian who returns to his roots, initially to spend time with his nanny. But the remote village in which he finds himself impacts him overwhelmingly, to the point where he begins to question his worldviews.

Progress is slow in certain parts of India. For each metropolitan like New Delhi and Mumbai, there are hundreds of overlooked villages who barely have education and electricity. In tiny Charanpur, Mohan meets Geeta (Gayatri Joshi), a half-remembered childhood playmate and now a school teacher. Gita looks askance at Mohan's RV, with all its modern amenities. She's slow to thaw to Mohan, believing (accurately) that Mohan intends to steal away her nanny, who is like a second mother to her (yes, this nanny is the same one Mohan had come to visit). Geeta is beautiful and independent (""There's more to a woman than just wearing bangles."") and fights so hard to provide education for all the children of Charanpur. You see, old ways are so very hard to change. The prevalent thinking is that little girls do not need school. And segregation of castes is strictly enforced. So no mixing of kids in school. Geeta fights hard, but it's a futile thing. Education and electricity. The village of Charanpur does have electricity, but infrequently. These are only some of the things to which Mohan is exposed. But they set the ball rolling, as Mohan's eyes are gradually opened to the inequalities and abject poverty of his homeland.

Two of the most wrenching (and memorable) moments in the film happen as Mohan travels many hours by train and boat to demand rent from a farmer. But, it turns out, this is a farmer so very ashamed of his inability to pay and so destitute he finds it a constant struggle to feed his starved family. Yet the farmer finds the wherewithal to share his meager food with Mohan. That heartbreaking scene is then followed by a stopover at a railway station, as Mohan sees a simple little boy desperately attempting to get the passengers to buy a glass of water for a coin. Dare ya. Dare ya not to feel something at these scenes.

But there are joyous moments, as well. One such moment pops up early in the film, as Mohan, enroute to Charanpur in his rigged-out RV, picks up a shaggy-haired wild man, which is all a lead-in to the invigorating, toe-tapping road song ""Yun Hi Chala Chal"" (""Keep Wandering""). Then there's that one evening when, as a power failure cuts short a film screening taking place in the village square, Mohan gives a lesson about the stars to the village children.

(Plot SPOILER really comin' up now, in this next paragraph.)

Big things stem from little things. One of my favorite moments is Mohan, having finally fully committed to the betterment of Charanpur, using his engineering savvy and pulling the villagers together in a massive project to provide electricity...for one light bulb. These scenes play out so well that you can't help but be touched by the payoff, when the recipient of that sole lit bulb, in a dismal hut, brokenly caresses one word: ""Electricity.""

Shahrukh Khan has made a lucrative film career out of histrionics. And it's a thumbs up to his talents that we realize he's overacting and yet are still vastly entertained by his movies. But SWADES finds a different Shahrukh, one who is more restrained and, therefore, even more effective. How is SWADES as watchable as LAGAAN? Simple. Shahrukh Khan. SWADES, being mostly an internal story and telling of one man's self-discovery, depends largely on Shahrukh's reactions, his ability to convey emotions, his underplaying. When Shahrukh stops messing around and actually acts for real, as he does here, he becomes even more magnetic on screen.

Not that he's by himself in all this. The supporting cast is mostly excellent, and particularly Gayatri Joshi. SWADES marks her film debut, not that you could tell by it. A striking beauty, Gayatri's acting is nothing but self-assured and fiery. She and Shahrukh spark in their scenes together. Also memorable are the actors who play Mohan's nanny, the postmaster/wrestler (really great!), and the ambitious cook. However, the actors who play the NASA folks fare poorly (not counting Shahrukh, naturally).

SWADES is, more than anything else, a heartfelt valentine to India. A valentine, and also a bit of a dis. Love of country is counterpointed by the lead character's assertions that changes do need to be effected in certain repressive aspects of Indian culture and tradition. As one character tells Mohan, so is SWADES telling its homeland: ""Go light your bulb.""
