8117173,2,B000F48D50,"(I meant 4 stars, not 2. Oops) If you grew up in the 1980's like me, than this particular Double Feature Editon should seem very savory. Although 2 very different films thematically, both Terminator and Robocop deal with very cool cyborg stories. I remember loving both these films as a kid and the concept of having both these films on one package is a no brainer, especially if you don't have these in your DVD library already. Bottom line, you won't get more wall-to-wall cyborg action in one package than this beauty!",1174089600,4,521,4.673913043478261
