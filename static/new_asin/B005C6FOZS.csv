8464889,4,B005C6FOZS,Guys gone wild after dark shows us several stunning men who love to show off their bodies. You have to see the german guy. Best butt ever for a ggw dude. Overall an enjoyable dvd.,1443916800,2,179,4.142857142857143
8464890,1,B005C6FOZS,"Not even worth the shipping and handling I paid.

Truth be told, my expectations were not very high for this series to begin with, but I bought three of them as gifts for a friend and couldn't believe how bad this particular one was. Nearly all of it was either a random assembly of clips from parties, scenes of guys starting but not finishing, or an incredibly boring build up to what was eventually a very anti-climactic finish.

If you absolutely MUST own a ""Guys Gone Wild"" DVD, I recommend ""Cream of the Crop"" as it is the least disappointing one I've seen, but definitely don't waste your money on this one.",1268265600,,614,4.473214285714286
8464891,5,B005C6FOZS,"IF YOU ARE FAMILIER WITH THIS SERIES THEN YOU KNOW WHAT TO EXPECT.  IT IS AS IT STATES GUYS GOING WILD!  SOME GO A LITTLE WILDER THAN OTHERS AND THIS SERIES HAS BEGUN TO ADD MORE TEASERS THAN IT USED TO HAVE BUT I AM STILL A FAN AND I OWN EVERY EDITION THAT HAS BEEN REALEASED.  FOR THE MONEY I THINK ITS WORTH IT, BUT I WOULD NOT WANT TO PAY RETAIL.  IF YOUR NOT SURE IF YOU WILL LIKE IT, THEN RENT IT FIRST.  THERE IS NOTHING HARD CORE BUT THAT SURE DOESNT KEEP IT FROM BEING HOT!",1227398400,2,482,3.78
8464892,2,B005C6FOZS,Owning several titles in the GGW series this one proved somewhat disappointing. The expectation for more skin was there but did not materialize. What few brief glances that were provided were poorly filmed and very badly lighted. You can see more at any beach. Warning ! Think twice.,1215302400,6,283,4.916666666666667
8464893,3,B005C6FOZS,"As a single, 45 yr old gay male, I've enjoyed most of the previous ""Guys Gone Wild"" in the series. This latest one is pretty much the same as all the others, but was intrigued to notice that one of the ""performers"" is actually Hans Ebson the gay porn star. He has been in many, many movies-I recognized him right off the bat. Actually, thought that was him on the cover, but said to myself, ""naahhh-couldn't be""!
Guys/gals-it's worth getting. Several really cute guys doing what they do best. I look forward to the next one.
And by the way, the title is ""After Dark"", not ""After Darl"" as stated on here. Didn't make sense to me at first, either.",1201132800,9,645,4.383333333333334
