5912057,5,B00EH0K9H8,"(Previous remarks removed by poster bc distributor has made good on promise.)

Update: Oct. 31, 2013- replacement bluray arrives and does appear to read tho I have not had time to view the entire program yet. A review of the performance to follow...

Thank you to Bill Evans and MPL for expediting deliveries despite my earlier skepticism to the contrary. My cynicism sometimes gets the better of me and I forget that decent human beings still do exist, however rare that may be.

Update: Nov. 11, 2013- I have watched this bluray twice now and all is well. MPL made good on delivery and the disc plays perfectly.
As for the performances, there are simply no words to describe the joy... No blathering over the music, just full, epic, flawless playing. I'm SO glad they got this fixed. If you buy this & get a bum copy, it sucks I know, but don't worry... it's absolutely worth the wait once you finally see the show. Every track is pitch perfect and the sound quality is spectacular.

Thank you, Flying Colors! Can't wait for the next record! Please do another bluray concert, too. Just maybe next time cross all the T's and dot a few i's before release day.

Peace-",1382054400,4,1167,4.564593301435407

5912059,4,B00EH0K9H8,"The company sent me a new and working DVD, would have been a 5 star except didn't get complete package, but it is all there without the packaging, I appreciate the company making things right. This is a corrected review with the original review as follows.  BTW a great concert DVD.

I don't think I have ever given a 1 star review at Amazon, and I will gladly change this one once the distributor makes things right.  1st of all, while the special features documentary, (if you can call it that) does work on my DVD player, the concert does not. I get music, but no video, it is a crying shame and so far the distributor of the DVD has not responded to my requests since day 1 of the release.  I emailed them, posted on the bands facebook page and much more.  Now don't take this wrong, but I don't and neither should anyone else blame the band.  I personally have met and worked with Steve Morse, he is a great guy and this is a great band.  I ordered the CD sometime ago and it is as well a great CD.  That said, I should also state, Amazon is great, they are sending me out another DVD, (which likely won't work either if from the same batch) but they are doing their part and if that DVD doesn't work they will refund the money, I'll keep the non working DVD for a Frisbee, and I will ultimately get my money back.  I do terribly want the DVD but whoever is managing this bands activities, including DVD device must be the same person working for the Obama Care Health Care Web site as neither is working, at all, and both are extremely frustrating.  That said, and I can say this since Steve personally called Twigs Jr., they need someone like Twigs on the case to make things right, no matter what the cost because the fans are worth it.

Hope that is all clear, I love the band, want the DVD, am very disappointed in the lack of response as to the problems that apparently people here and at the bands Face book page are having.  I want me some working Flying Colors, Live In Europe DVD on Blu-ray!",1381968000,2,2006,4.2362204724409445
5912060,5,B00EH0K9H8,"I am updating my review. I received my replacement blu ray disc and let me say that although I was disappointed about the technical problems, this band is excellent. These guys really put on a first rate show. Each of their abilities on their given instrument are outstanding. Even though each one is great at what they do, the real stand out for me was Dave Larue. Let me just say wow! So, if you read my old review (below), can't anyone do anything right, even though someone dropped the ball on the technical end of things, this band definitely got the playing part right. I can't wait for the follow up album.

 The first problem is the packaging. You almost have to break the disc to get it out of the case. What was wrong with plain old dvd/ blu ray cases. Then after fighting the disk out of the case, the stupid thing won't play.
Do these companies just not care? Is there no quality control? It is very frustrating to try and support a band, buy there products and run into these issues.
Now it is just another hassle to have to sort out with the seller and have ro wait longer for the product.
I am extremely dissapointed!",1381881600,5,1132,4.334905660377358

I pre-ordered this the day it became available and have been looking forward to it and it does not play in my PS3.

Upon insrting the disc I received a screen flicker then a black screen with audible audio.  My Onkyo TX-SR608 receiver displayed a ""Resolution Error"" message.  I then checked the disc specs and it showed a resolution of 570p/50.  This resolution is for PAL/SECAM broadcast and is counted as ""enhanced-definition television (EDTV).""

Let me tell you I was blown away with the music and how good the show was. I have been a huge Flying colors fan ever since and I saw them live at the Keswick theater in Philadelphia on October 4, 2014. The music this band writes is different, fresh, and so not what you will here anywhere else. They have 2 CDs out  which are both exellant and they are awesome live. My only complaint is that I wish they would make this band their number one priority cuz I would love for lots more music from them.",1412899200,2,690,3.964028776978417

5912078,5,B00EH0K9H8,"The audio quality is amazing. Although, it does not load DTS by default.  You have to set this up before you play the set list.  The performance is top notch. All of the musicians are on point and the audio engineering is fantastic! The bass guitar is a little hot, but that is to be expected with a DTS recording. And I don't mind this being a bass player myself.

Aside from the occasional rushed drum fill by Mike Portnoy, this is an amazing performance.  The only gripe that I have is that the backing vocals are not live.  They mix in backing vocal tracks to make the Blu-ray sound better. Or more likely, the backing tracks were delivered during the live performance from a pre-recorded sample. And, I don't blame them. With the technical music that they are playing, you have to focus on what you are executing, not the vocal harmonies. You can also pick up on some vocal correction from the live vocals. Which is to be expected.  We do after all live in the 21st century yeah?

Rest assured that Casey McPherson's vocals and Neil Morse's vocals are authentic. But they have been massaged slightly to sound better for the DTS surround sound mixing.  Not that they need a lot of massaging in the first place. That doesn't mean that they, or any of the musicians, are not worthy of extreme praise. I found this Blu-ray disc to be one of my favorites. The presentation, sound, visuals including the lighting, and everything else combined to make it an amazing experience.

You will not be sorry for purchasing this disc. Nothing in here makes me give this any less than five stars. I hope you agree.",1397865600,3,1603,4.5190311418685125

Steve Morse alone has played with some of the best bands on the planet including Dixie Dregs, Kansas, Deep Purple and of course, The Steve Morse Band.  Dave Portnoy is a fantastic drummer having spent time in Dream Theater and Transatlantic.  Also from Transatlantic and Spock's Beard is multi-talented Neal Morse and from Dixie Dregs, bassist Dave LaRue.  Casey McPherson is a wonderful singer and provides most of the lead vocals.

This release has a ""region free"" marker on it. It does play in my ""region B"" player.

If this disc was restricted by the ""region code"", it would not play. A message would come up, advising of the restriction.

The Stereo soundtrack plays fine. The DTS-HD MA 5.1 audio leans terribly to the right (it is not centred).

The performance is good, and if this product was not faulty, I'd give 4 stars (I reserve 5 stars for my favorites).",1382400000,2,494,4.395604395604396
5912093,5,B00EH0K9H8,"This is the first I've heard that there was a problem with the blu-ray discs. I was curious as to whether the double CD was worth purchasing. It was when I was reviewing the comments about the CD's that I saw that people had been having serious problems with the blu-ray.

I've already got the blu-ray (pre-ordered and delivered the day of release...October 17th) and have had no problems whatsoever with the playback. I even froze images so I could send digital images to friends showing how incredible the resolution is. I will admit to only having listened so far to the first few songs...through Odyssey...but it appears the problems people are having are in getting the disc to play at all.

It's really sad that this amazing blu-ray has stumbled on release. Flying Colors is an amazing band, and this blu-ray does justice to their masterful music. I've been a fan of Steve Morse and the Dixie Dregs for a very long time, and never thought Steve would front a vocal band, much less a great vocal band, but that's exactly what he's done! Here's to all the people who have had problems...I hope they'll be worked out as soon as possible and you all can enjoy this amazing video. Too bad you'll have to wait, but as it was on pre-order, it is worth the wait...I guarantee it!",1382313600,,1277,4.547826086956522
