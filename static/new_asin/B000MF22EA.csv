8168211,5,B000MF22EA,"I am lucky, I managed to buy this... I have been on tvdvdworld.tv (mine shipped from Canada) and ordered the Nanny complete series.  They were also sold out, I had to wait three weeks before I got it.  Unfortunately the service of ordering (there was no mail for tracking, even if they mailed me to confirm my order and informed of the tracking email), and delivery wasn't that good (2 of the 3 DVD boxes were broken), and neither was the quality of the DVDs.  There were 4 discs not working (I had to ask for a refund, as they couldn't guarantee when new stock was in.  So I am still missing some, but at least I saw some episodes (I left the country where they were showing it) I never saw before, MAN I LAUGHED MY HEAD OFF!!! I just love it!!",1211241600,4,745,4.188811188811189
