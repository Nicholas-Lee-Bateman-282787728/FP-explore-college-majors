8456109,1,B00542USJC,"Here's how the ""logic"" in this slasher flick works: One of your pub co-workers has just been brutally murdered in the ladies room while you heard the whole thing from the next stall. After screaming and getting knocked out, you come to, scream some more, and tell the manager and others what happened. Then, after you've calmed down a little, you go right back to serving your patrons as they ask for more beer. At least until the next dead body shows up. That's an example of the ""logic"" in this movie. Oh, and it's NOT a spoof. Later, after the female lead finally gets out of the locked bar after pounding on every locked door in the place, she arms herself with a field hockey stick and goes right back in, somehow getting in through doors that are locked from the inside. After it's all over and the police have finally arrived, she and the bar manager meet in his office while he counts the day's receipts and make a date to meet up later. Then she leaves, and there's not one police car or ambulance or forensics truck--not even a news van--parked outside the bar, despite the high body count. Yep, that's the ""logic"" employed in this script by writer, producer, director Kate Glover, who must never be allowed to work in this industry again. Don't reward her by spending even a penny on this poor excuse of a film.",1376092800,4,1322,4.466942148760331
8456110,1,B00542USJC,"As a B-horror film junkie, I both accept and expect a degree of stupididty in the movies I watch. ""Slaughtered,"" however, drives the stupid car right off the cliff and became nothing short of insulting. (Spoiler alert) This is a very cliche plot: A bunch of attractive young adults working in a bar/inn, a masked killer, and one by one they go off on their own to be-slaughtered. The stupid car begins to go over the cliff early on, when the first body is found-the person is lying on a pool table, covered in blood, and can clearly be seen to be breathing heavily, although the camera is about ten feet away. The director evidently never thought to say ""in this seen, you are dead-so hold your breath for about ten seconds, because dead people don't breathe."" The characters, now aware there is a killer amongst them, decide to not tell anyone else in the crowded bar, because they don't want to alarm anyone. They continue this policy as the bodies mount and as their friends are brutally killed. Like me, they would rather see their friends tortured one by one rather than upsetting them by WARNING THEM THEY MAY BE TORTURED AND KILLED. The doors are locked from their side, yet the victims just bang on those same doors announcing ""we're locked in"" rather than opening the stupid locks. When they finally decide to think about protecting the patrons, the main character meekly asks the bar-goers to move to another room without telling them why, then announces to her friend ""they are too drunk to move"" as the patrons continue to engage in friendly conversation with one-another. The main character runs around in panic much of the time, nobody ever grabs a weapon until late in the movie, when someone finally does give a warning it is ignored ""they're just playing a trick on you"" (despite copious amounts of blood and multiple dissapearences during the busiest time at the bar), and nobody thinks to coordinate the bar patrons or warn them of the danger even though these are all tough Australian outback types. When the main character does pick up a weapon (fire extinguisher), she hits the villain once in the head, and then engages in the stupidest and most unforgivable cliche in all slasher films; she hits the villain once, then stares at him, then drops the weapon besides the villain, then quietly walks over the prone killer so he can grab at her and kill the rest of her friends. She remains this pathetic until the end, when she suddenly and inexplicably grabs another weapon and with no questions asked kills a patron who was obviously not the killer, hacking repeatedly at this man who was trying to stop the real killer. The police come, apparently do not feel there is a need to investigate despite about a dozen murders, and the killer is free to put away his outfit in a safe (BTW-the only shock in all of this would be if a viewer could not figure out who the killer was by about the 15 minute mark). Awful, unforgivable movie. I do not know why nobody tried to improve the script to make it even remotely believable, or just went for the comdey route. This is so idiotic it is impossible to be scared at all. If someone watches this and is surpirised by the ending or believes this is a great film; well, I hope you are warm and safe, and hope your caretakers are treating you kindly...unless you are ten years old, in which case stay in school and you shouldn't be watching this in the first place.",1329609600,7,3426,4.572357723577236
