2516113,3,B000ECX0QK,"I must agree with another review that the acting is very good to brilliant sometimes and the film and story are most unusual.  Would I watch it again?  I think I will sometime in the future.  It is filled with strange sexuality which gives the film a kind of ""alien"" feeling.  This kind of sex is not what one would ordinarily expect to see between ordinary human beings.  It is not aimed at building a relationship, expressing love for another or interested in procreation.  It has some other usage.  Pure lust in some instances with no other ameliorating feelings.  Some of the film is blatantly absurd:  the Chinese conquering Russia (and all the Chinese looking like Russians with heavy makeup).  The dialog is sometimes quite stilted and its function is sometimes hard to understand or maybe impossible to understand.  You must not take this film seriously, at least in my opinion.  It is kind of a hallucinatory romp, the essence of which is probably impossible for the non-Russian to understand and I would guess that even Russians might be scratching their heads after watching the film..  Good luck.",1443139200,3,1108,4.829787234042553

2516115,1,B000ECX0QK,"Huh?  I watch a lot of foreign language movies. I've watched at least a few Polish movies and I couldn't get this one at all.  I guess it's a farce, but I found it too ridiculous for words .  Perhaps I'm too American?  Or perhaps the movie just sucks?  Not really sure.",1442016000,6,269,4.096153846153846
2516116,5,B000ECX0QK,"If you think outside of the box - you'll love this movie - a wicked political-sexual romp - a thinly veiled critique of the world of modern politics, business and power...",1404086400,4,171,4.548387096774194
2516117,3,B000ECX0QK,"I have just read Richard Brzostek's review of Insatiability and, having just watched the film, I agree with him entirely.  This is a strange film and not one that resonated with me. I don't know whether Richard has the advantage of speaking Polish, but I found the often clumsy subtitles a hindrance to following the film. I see some clown describes the film on the cover of the DVD as ""A futuristic remake of Pasolini's Salo"" and elsewhere we are introduced to ""Our stunningly handsome young hero..."" Unfortunately, neither description is valid. The film runs for just under 2 hours and can rightly be described as theater - but I came away very disappointed. I can see how it can be described as a sex romp and I suppose it tries hard to flirt with political and philosopical themes, but then, so do Marvel comics, I guess",1285804800,4,824,4.605442176870748

2516121,1,B000ECX0QK,"Only the incurably deranged could make or enjoy watching this bizarre exercise in weirdness. Its deliberately freaky but completely disjointed and incoherent from the first minute.

2516122,5,B000ECX0QK,"My Polish in-laws were in town so we rented this movie. It was good and funny until it went gay (for them, anyway). I told them they needed to expect some weird sex stuff based on the picture, but no body listens to me. Unfortunately, I never got to finish it, but I liked what I saw.",1449100800,,284,4.0

2516127,2,B000ECX0QK,I have to agree with some of the reviews stating this is one strange and incomprehensible film! Too artsy for me to enjoy(poor old nebish me!).but the acting was good and the production values were very good.. This must have been  the Academy Award film of the art houses!,1443312000,4,272,4.551020408163265
