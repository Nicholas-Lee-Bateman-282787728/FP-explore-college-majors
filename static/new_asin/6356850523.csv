8073816,5,6356850523,I was very impressed when I first saw this film. It has the most realistic fight scenes I have ever seen in a kung fu film. The drunken style teacher is great and unique. If you love kun fu films get this. This is my favorite martial arts film thus far.,1329350400,,253,3.980392156862745
8073817,4,6356850523,"The good thing about the movie is, it's all there and then some. I remember many years ago seeing this on TV(Showtime), and recording it on VHS. When it finally came out on DVD, I read other reviews where they had cut the scene where the monkey takes on a cobra. I chose to wait on a complete, or what I thought was a complete version. I finally found such a version and it actually had more content in it then I saw on TV. It's a great Kung-Fu flick.
Now the bad news. the viewing quality is pour. Not terrible but, well it reminds me of what you would see from old world war 2 footage. Still, for the money, it is definitely worth having if you are an enthusiast of these types of movies. Great fight scenes, with a sprinkle of comedy for flavor. A real Kung-Fu classic.",1234137600,,772,4.153333333333333
8073818,4,6356850523,"Okay, yes Liang is the student, but whoever wrote up the paragraph explaining the story got it a bit wrong.

The story starts off with a battle between the friend that Liang learns the monkey technique from and one of the two snake style killers.

At the time, the snake expert was going around taking out other snake style experts(among other kung fu style experts) to prove that he was the foremost exponent of the style. His name is prenounced ""Sier Saw"", though I don't remember the exact spelling. He challenges the monkey expert and loses. Shamed by his loss and the fact that the monkey expert won't finish him off and let him die in battle, he swears revenge.

Liang is a poor fish seller that sneaks around to learn drunken boxing and is eventually allowed to become a full time student.

Now, the father of the two bullies does hire Sier Saw and another exponent of the snake style that he has brought back with them(though he was too arrogant to role solo before his lose in the beginning of the movie).  They only come across them because they come through town on their way to getting back to the monkey expert. They are not hired to kill Liang and don't the first time they have a chance to. They are hired to kill Liang's teacher. At that point, Liang wasn't good enough yet and they didn't see him worth the mark of killing. They come across him again and this time Sier Saw actually tries to, but the other guy still doesn't see him worth it.

Great Kungfu scenes and great storyline. Yes, it is your traditional revenge for teacher storyline, but they decorated it enough so that it has some color about it. I recommend getting this movie.",1215734400,,1657,4.470198675496689
