4859121,3,B005QODEEE,"It's Christmas-time and Manny, Sid, Diego are all preparing for the upcoming holiday. When Sid destroys Manny's Christmas Rock that has been passed down from generation to generation Manny tells him he's now on Santa's naughty list and he won't get Christmas. This devastates Sid and Peaches convinces him he should go to the North Pole to talk to Santa. So, Sid, Peach, Crash, and Eddie set out together following the Northern Lights to Santa's house. Along the way they meet a flying reindeer and an army of mini-sloths (who kind of look like elves), but their planned meeting with Santa doesn't quite go the way as planned and Christmas could be ruined for everyone. Also, like all the ICE AGE adventures, Scrat continues to chase that elusive acorn. Scrat's chase causes him to become a figure skater, has him kiss a prehistoric spider, and eventually leads him on a ride in Santa's sleigh.

ICE AGE: A MAMMOTH CHRISTMAS SPECIAL is kind of cute. There are some things that completely don't make any sense such as how a frozen star can destroy a three-ton granite rock or why two adult wooly mammoths aren't able to pull a giant sled. Also, Santa isn't portrayed as his usual jolly self and though he makes toys for children, he's a bit conceited. For instance, he enjoys singing songs about himself and takes a little too much glee in creating the naughty list. He also gets angry rather easily and isn't at all optimistic. My favorite parts of the movie were the scenes with the mini-sloths (I think it was a neat touch that Santa's elves are actually mini-sloths) and all the scenes with Scrat.

This short is a little bit pricey, but kids will enjoy it as well as ICE AGE fans. The DVD features a sneak peak clip of ICE AGE: CONTINENTAL DRIFT as well as a music video featuring a mini-sloth choir singing ""Swingin' Jingle Bells"".",1322179200,45,1836,4.6461538461538465
4859122,3,B005QODEEE,"It's an ice age short :)  Enjoyable movie short. But 8$ for 20 minutes of content is rather ridiculous. 20% of the short/movie is credits.  The kids enjoy it, but it really should have been 50 - 60 minutes at least. I'll likely create a Christmas compilation disc with it :)",1322006400,94,274,4.352941176470588
4859123,4,B005QODEEE,So very very short film. But cute and kids would enjoy. I think they could add some extras to make it a better buy overall however. If you like the series youngster or older folks too...sure add it to your collection...who doesn't enjoy Scrat.,1520553600,,243,4.545454545454546

4859160,5,B005QODEEE,"The first Ice Age holiday special made for TV was A Mammoth Christmas in 2011; it debuted on Fox Thanksgiving Night that year, and it arrived on DVD & 2D Blu-ray the following Saturday! The 3D Blu-ray releases came along in later years. At any rate, as Shrek the Halls in 2007 took place between Shrek 3 & 4, Ice Age: A Mammoth Christmas took place between its own 3rd and 4th movies, when Peaches was a little kid Mammoth played by former Nick star Ciara Bravo. Also in this instant holiday classic are Prancer (played by T.J. Miller, who'd later play Fred/SuperFred in Big Hero 6, Disney's 54th animated feature) and his family of reindeer who'd join Santa as his sleigh team, Santa's army of mini-sloths (the Santa-Rage), and Santa himself, in the style of the cavepeople of the original Ice Age movie, but can talk like the animals can, and can understand them! Alongside the movies, A Mammoth Christmas also deserves a spot in your home video library, either for the Ice Age movies or for your Christmas classics collection! Stay tuned for my review of the much-sought-after Easter special, The Great Egg-Scapade, which debuted in 2016!",1490832000,2,1141,4.738693467336684

I should have been suspicious when the description does not indicate length of time, which I still don't know the answer to.  My biggest complaint is the ""digital copy"".  I purchased a combination Blu Ray/DVD/Digital expecting to use it on Vudu. NOT this digital. It only plays on a laptop or other device.  WHAT?  I have a DVD/Blu Ray player on my laptop. Why would I want a separate disc to carry around just to put in my laptop?  STUPID. What a waste of money.",1484092800,,534,4.3

4859177,1,B005QODEEE,"If I could describe this movie in one word, it would LAME. I can't believe I paid $9.99 for this movie in 3D. The best thing it had going for it was that it was 3D. The plot was disjoined and all over the place. I suppose really young children would enjoy it, because they don't pay attention to plot, but the viewing will be sheer torture for the adult watching with them.

Ok so this is the Christmas special. I don't have little ones, my boy as of this review is 15, he watches the Christmas movies with me every December, it is our tradition, we go through our collection watching Christmas movies, cartoons to live action movies like Gremlins. My 15 year old loves this one still, he loved it when he was 4, 5, 6. Who doesn't love dinosaurs and wooly mammoths.

It's shorter, not a 2 hour full length, it will amuse your kids. It might even amuse your older kids. I recommend it, it's a cute Christmas flick.",1459382400,,748,4.223776223776224

There is noting to indicate that it's a short movie unless you look into the product details: Run Time: 26 minutes. Actual time, after video intro and closing credits, is less than that.

4859359,1,B005QODEEE,"Don't buy:
Only 25 minutes long but cost the same as the other Ice Age movies that are far better and keep your child entertained for more than an hour!  Bad story line with a grumpy, annoying Santa and very little to do with Christmas or the main Ice Age characters that make the movies fun to watch.  The movie feels like a last minute effort to stretch the Ice Age theme and squeeze a few more bucks from the audience.  If you haven't done so, I suggest you buy the other Ice Age movies.  Or invest in a fun, quality movie like Rio!

4859380,2,B005QODEEE,"Cute movie with a few decent 3D effects, but it was only about 20 minutes long!  When I bought it, I thought I was buying a movie, not an animated short like you would see before the main event.  And that's how we treated it, as a cute prelude to another 3D movie, but I can't help feeling like I paid too much.",1419033600,,311,3.9206349206349205

I thought it would be fun to bring this out each year as an alternative to Frosty and Rudolph, but it appears that the networks have started including it in their yearly holiday programming too.  Oh well.  At least we can watch our version without the commercial interruptions.  It still made for a great stocking stuffer for the kids.",1409011200,2,449,4.5625

4859439,5,B005QODEEE,This was a cute show but I did not know that it was a short movie. It was over too quick and the kids were wondering what happened to the movie. They thought they skipped something.,1402185600,,181,4.055555555555555
4859440,4,B005QODEEE,The product arrived on time. The product was brand new. The product was sealed and in excellent condition. I am happy with the product and would buy from them again. I like the bigger combos due to wear and tear or over use and more longevity. The price was great.,1401148800,,264,4.3

4859454,2,B005QODEEE,"I should've probably done more research. The 3D quality is pretty good, as well as the sound. But it's ONLY 25 min movie. I just want potential buyers to know it's not a full movie.",1395446400,3,181,4.2

4859457,3,B005QODEEE,Awww adorable Scrat and friends. I just wanted it to be longer. It was worth it though and a totally new story. Never can have too much Ice Age.,1394582400,,144,4.0
4859458,2,B005QODEEE,Christmas special is well there. Looks like it was a half fast movie. like it some because it's ice age.,1394496000,,104,4.25
4859459,2,B005QODEEE,For an adult I found it lacking.  It would be good for a  young child.  Not a full length movie.,1393891200,,96,3.7
4859460,4,B005QODEEE,"This special is just what you would expect from the Ice Age franchise: Christmas with a prehistoric spin and a lot of humor. Manny is trying to share his Christmas traditions with daughter Peaches when Sid turns everything to shambles, angering Manny and ultimately sending Peaches on a quest to prove Santa is real and sending Manny and Ellie into a tailspin searching for their daughter. Eventually the plot and attitude of the story completely change and the whole gang winds up helping Santa save Christmas.
Along the way, we are introduced to the beginnings of a few Christmas traditions and given a somewhat new backstory for Santa Claus with answers to how he got the reindeer and the evolution of Santas elves.
This is a very charming Christmas special complete with family spats, Scrats exploits, and a heartwarming ending.",1393804800,3,832,4.95
4859461,5,B005QODEEE,"This is a fun, entertaining movie that the little ones can enjoy not just during the holidays but all year round!  Very cute, funny and entertaining for the whole family.  I would highly recommend to others.",1393804800,,207,4.722222222222222

4859464,5,B005QODEEE,Bought for our grandchildren to watch at our house when they come to visit.  Really entertaining - a holiday movie for family fun.,1392768000,,130,4.6521739130434785
4859465,5,B005QODEEE,"This wonderful short of Christmas fun is great for all ages, and Scrat is just all in his glory with the Acorn! a must see and of course all the same voices you enjoyed in all the other Ice Age movies have returned.... so much to enjoy!",1392508800,,236,4.042553191489362
4859466,4,B005QODEEE,The 3D CG animation was good and the Christmas tale was entertaining.  The simple lighthearted story was the same as when it aired on television.,1392336000,,145,4.8
4859467,5,B005QODEEE,"Delighted with this short 3D whilst a lots of movies on the market are less desirable due to their drugs & violence contents where they do glorified criminals  & drugoes alike.
My thanks for selling such delight go to Amazon US & their staff.",1392076800,,242,4.5
4859468,4,B005QODEEE,"It was un to watch, but too short. Too bad it could not have been twice as long. More enjoyable.",1391990400,,96,3.85
4859469,5,B005QODEEE,I started a tradition this year and decided to go with this short movie for Christmas morning and it was awesome! The story line was adorable and our 5 month old paid full attention (which is hard for that age). She loved it from what I could tell! It was perfect for the transition time between opening gifts to getting ready to go see family since it wasn't two hours long.,1391990400,,375,4.295774647887324
4859470,5,B005QODEEE,"It was great, we bought it for US and the Grand kids, but it was all to short, but we will all watch it again even if it is not Christmas time.",1391904000,,143,3.5
4859471,2,B005QODEEE,"This title is misleading. You get 25 minutes of movie and that's it.
I guess I should have paid more attention to details.",1391558400,,122,4.3478260869565215
4859472,5,B005QODEEE,"Really it was too expensive because it was so short, but it is very funny.  My family and I enjoyed it!",1391299200,,103,3.9047619047619047

4859474,3,B005QODEEE,"This is a really funny and cute Ice Age Christmas Special, but it is very short - basically the length of one TV episode (22 min.) - they should make 2-3 more of these and put them all on 1 DVD. If they were smart, they would do what has been done with Shrek and Madagascar... make several shorts for all different holidays. Those are on Netflix by the way in case you're interested. :-) The Ice Age collection is just so good and I think they should make use of that by making more holiday specials instead of just more movies.",1391040000,,528,4.186274509803922
4859475,5,B005QODEEE,This is a clever morality tale hidden inside a slightly insane story of mythical activities among realistic beasts; you'll love it.,1390953600,,131,5.285714285714286
4859476,3,B005QODEEE,"I have all four Ice Age movies and thought this would be as well written, but I was disappointed. It seems it was a cheap shot at selling a Christmas movie in order to get the money. Little kids may like it, but it lacks what the other movies have. I would recommend it, but only for little children who want the complete set of Ice Age movies.",1390953600,,344,4.073529411764706

4859481,3,B005QODEEE,I loved this movie.  The only problem I had was it was too short.  I would have liked to have more than 25 minutes of this very funny story.,1390348800,,140,3.793103448275862
4859482,4,B005QODEEE,Scrat never fails to make us giggle. Good Ice Age fun. The DVD plays well in our machine and I got a good deal on it from Amazon.,1390262400,,129,3.642857142857143

4859484,2,B005QODEEE,"I got this dvd for a long road trip...first it was shipped slow, and I did not receive it until we returned from our road trip!
What a waste!  I decided to keep it anyway, didn't want to ship it back...then I realized this movie only ran for about 20 minutes!
I guess I should've looked at the length!  My loss!",1390262400,,311,4.081967213114754
4859485,5,B005QODEEE,"My grandchildren loved the movie. I was trying to send them a Christmas Eve treat that they would enjoy and this one worked. They told me that they had not seen it before and they liked it. That is good enough for me. It arrived early and was well wrapped so they did not know what was in the box.

Thank you",1390176000,,308,3.967741935483871

It did bring back our favorite furry characters but it just feels forced there doesn't seem to be the same play the voice actors have had in the movies. It takes place after the 3rd movie so we see some development of Peaches. Also there is another pack of mini sloths. It's relatively short 26 min. Scrats nut chasing isn't what it used to be. It's cute but not worth 15 dollars if you can get it stuck to another movie or for 5 dollars it might be worth it.,1328832000,,566,4.25

4859669,1,B005QODEEE,"I wouldn't even call this a movie. It is VERY short. 26 minutes is what is on the cover, and the price is way too high for that short of a movie. (IMO even $5 would be too much to pay for this DVD.)",1325376000,5,198,3.522727272727273
4859670,5,B005QODEEE,"Ice Age is always a good one for children and families! It's funny with good values. This one is endearing like the others, but this Christmas one is only 25 or so minutes long. It's worth the price and a great addition to your collection of quality family viewing. I highly recommend it for its animation, storyline, humor, and apprpriateness for all ages to enjoy.",1325376000,,366,4.6461538461538465

Was cute but, too short.",1325203200,,107,4.142857142857143
4859672,5,B005QODEEE,We have all of the ice age movies and was excited to find a Christmas storyline!  Short but sweet and a nice change from the usual holiday specials.  We'll add this to our Christmas viewing list each year!,1325116800,,205,4.368421052631579
4859673,1,B005QODEEE,"We had no problem with the supplier/seller of this product.  We were disappointed in the content.  It was standard affair with the Christmas story being told... the tree, Santa, reindeer, etc.  The problem is that the movie is only 5 minutes long.  DON'T BOTHER!  It's not worth the money.",1324944000,,289,4.816326530612245
4859674,5,B005QODEEE,"A great DVD and very cute plot. Despite it only being 20 minutes, it's still cute! I love Peaches voice! So funny! A must have for all Ice Age fans!",1324944000,,148,3.966666666666667
4859675,3,B005QODEEE,"At a mere 25 minutes, it's hard to find too much wrong or right with this minor entry in the ICE AGE franchise.
All the popular characters are back and a new one added---the reindeer Prancer, aptly voiced by Seann William Scott.
It's light holiday fare with Peaches the baby mammoth venturing off to the North Pole to prove Santa's existence.  Okay family fun, and maybe someday Scrat will get his nut!!!",1324857600,,404,4.611111111111111
4859676,4,B005QODEEE,"Ice Age:

If you liked the cartoon movies I can't see how you could possibly fail to enjoy this.

It isn't as long as the features, but it is certainly as funny for me.

Brain salad, yes, great to sit down with the little ones without blowing half a christmas afternoon, yes.

Animation is of the usual high standard, the theme and storyline isn't quite up to previous ""Ice Age"" movies, but it has to be remembered it's not intended to be a full length series continuation.

It's certainly a movie that can be watched yearly and the kids will continue to enjoy it more than once.

It was reasonably predictable and fell in line with what was generally expected to be in this flick, but even so it certainly didn't dissapoint. It's a series that remains enjoyable for adults though focused, here, on the five to twelve's - with twelve perhaps even being a bit on the higher side of the range.

Value, got to be 4 stars.",1324771200,,918,4.396449704142012
4859677,3,B005QODEEE,"Cute as the full length feature films, but one thing that bothers me is that this takes place millions of years before the birth of christ! sure he may not be mentioned in the film, Santa and reindeer are the only symbol of Christmas in here but Christmas only happened because of somebody born long after the film took place",1324684800,,325,4.433333333333334
4859678,2,B005QODEEE,"A 20min. clip not a movie, very dissapointed, it is not worth the money!!it should be advertised as movie clip, not movie!!",1324598400,,123,4.636363636363637

4859680,3,B005QODEEE,"OK, so it's great computer animation with good characters, but that's as far as the positives go in this incredibly terse Christmas special that essentially serves as a 20-minute commercial for the latest Ice Age feature.

To start with, the story makes no sense. Internal consistency is important in all good storytelling, particularly in cartoons, and when writers deviate just because it proves to be convenient to do so that's nothing other than sloppy writing. So here we have a story that is set in the great Ice Age, yet for  some reason we have a very human Santa Claus and a bunch of animals who are about to celebrate Christmas. I found it to be rather novel that one character is credited with creating the Christmas tree--fine, this is supposed to be happening in pre-history so it makes sense. But then we have a flying reindeer (reindeer's being a species that would not even have existed during the period) who shows up out of nowhere and flies for no explained reason. And Santa Claus lives at the North Pole making toys for--whom? ""Children,"" according to the character, yet we never see any other humans anywhere.

I won't bore you with any other details--first, it would be pointless and second, the run time of this is so short than you could watch its entirety as fast as you could read the review--but suffice it to say that I believe that the creative minds missed a huge opportunity here. A great Christmas-themed story could have been produced that did not deviate from the Ice Age mythos' established internal consistency. Why was Santa Claus needed? and why reindeer? Less lazy writers would have called on Christmas themes yet not upset already well-defined parameters.",1324425600,,1697,4.824742268041237
4859681,1,B005QODEEE,This was bad.  It was a waste of time.  It was an embarrassment.  It made no sense . . . The Ice Age was BC . . . that is the first clue.  Even if you over come that issue there is nothing redeeming in this video.  Even . . . no . . . especially for children there are so many better video for them to see.  This was just exploiting the Ice Age characters.,1324339200,,356,3.6184210526315788
4859682,5,B005QODEEE,Lovin this little Chrismas movie.  Appreciate Amazon for making it available and at a good price.  Anyone who loves the Ice Age Movie series wil want this for sure!,1324080000,,164,4.620689655172414

4859684,2,B005QODEEE,"Excellent 1080p Blu-Ray animation and DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1.

TWO STARS BECAUSE FEATURE IS ONLY 25 MINUTES LONG.

You would think they should have marketed it as ""A 'Short' Christmas Special"" or ""A Mammoth Christmas 'Short'"" because it is only half a movie.

Did I mention the movie is only 25 minutes long?",1323475200,3,309,4.7924528301886795

4859686,4,B005QODEEE,"My daughter received this as a gift from her Grandma. She absolutely loves it and has watched it multiple times already.  The price definitely should be more reasonable, but I love the short duration because it means she isn't watching tv for a long time.

4859687,4,B005QODEEE,"The show is very cute, as the others have said, and there are a few quirks regarding Santa Claus and the sleigh.  I bought the BR/DVD/Digital @ Walmart on Black Friday for $8, but I would not have gotten it if I had realized there was only about 20-21 minutes of video.  Both of my boys really enjoyed it, as my wife and I did, as well as my mother.  It is funny and will crack you up, but definitely don't pay more than $8 for it.",1323302400,4,431,3.9310344827586206

We always loo forward to watching these short movies as a family as a bit of a family tradition every year. This movie was fun and engaging and you are able to spend some time with some of the great characters that you have met in the Ice Age movies in the past as well. The story was solid and the animation was up to par with other Ice Age Movies that I have watched in the past. While it is short, you still get a lot of quality in this for the length that you are given which is great! I know that for at least us, this movie will be added to our Christmas collection!",1323302400,,654,3.962121212121212
