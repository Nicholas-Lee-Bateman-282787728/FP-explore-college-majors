3013222,5,B000Y7WGT2,"The year was 2005. It was the year of Batman Begin-ning, Resident Evil returning for the fourth time, and Stephen Colbert taking the nation by storm. At the ADV offices, the guys in charge of buying licenses were getting pissed-drunk in celebration of the 6th re-release of the Platinum Evangelion edition DVDs. In their inebriated states, they somehow purchased the rights to release a God-awful, cheesey, cliched kids show about ghosts. After the rays of morning (and the passing of their massive hangovers) had brought their folly to light, these intrepid office workers desperately sought to find some way of saving their all too doomed jobs and keeping their 401k's.

Thankfully, desperation often breeds genius, and this is the case with Ghost Stories. With the dub, they decided to get rid of the original script's dialogue and transform the somewhat morbid children's genre drama and turn it into an over the top and hilarious comedy. Make no mistake, this is not kid's stuff. This is adult humor at its bawdiest. If the idea of elementary school kids trash talking about sex, the mentally handicapped, homosexuals, religion, sex, beastiality, sex, the nation's broken health care system, sex, and old people offends you greatly, then this is not the show for you. Go watch some high-brow anime like Kino's Journey or some Miyazaki. This is low-brow gutter humor at its gourmet finest.

THINGS THAT MAY OFFEND: Kids cursing; numerous pre-teen panty shots, dead animals; dead people; dead animals having sex with dead people (kidding, maybe); anti-Christian rhetoric; anti-Jewish rhetoric; anti-Muslim rhetoric; anti-EVERYBODY rhetoric; gay retarded little brothers; dead lesbian mothers; evil talking cats; a fifth-grade boy who sounds like a 30 year old but retains the horniness of said fifth-grade boy; disturbingly hot female ghosts (don't judge me); more pop culture references than Buffy the Vampire Slayer and a new Doctor Who episode penned by Russel T. Davies COMBINED.",1227657600,56,1986,5.261829652996846
3013223,5,B000Y7WGT2,Anyone who doesn't think this is funny has absolutely zero sense of humor and should be watching soap operas or reading a historical novel. This is not a heart warming story about a family whose wife died. Its the funniest anime I have ever watched. More than all the 300 Anime movies I have in my collection put together. It really pokes fun at nerds and straight laced political correct snobs. It made me realize how brainwashed Americans are that we can't even poke fun at ourselves. This is NOT about a family trying to adjust after a mother dies. The family is perfectly adjusted to the mother being dead and have moved on even joking about the dead mother --which has nothing to do with the theme. A group of kids go into the old haunted school house looking for their lost cat and the adventure starts. I have 600 movies and 300 anime in my collection and this is the first movie that has made me laugh out loud. Ghost stories describes itself as wicked fun. A reluctant ghost hunter. Her babbling baby brother. A horny pre-teen. Its 5 discs not 1 and contains 1-20 episodes--each a separate ghost adventure -- 550 minutes long. This anime is so funny I am watching it twice and may even watch it 3 times. I recommend it for anyone who is sick and tired of political correct authoritarians ruling their lives. No holds barred comedy. English dubbed voices and translations are great. Totally funny!!!,1226880000,,1407,4.565217391304348

3013256,5,B000Y7WGT2,"The English dub was mostly improvised, and it is the one of the greatest things to ever happen in anime. Even if you strictly prefer subtitles, I think every anime fan needs to have this in their collection. Because the script has been mostly thrown out the window and every other line is improvised, I love it. It has a snowball effect to it, where at the beginning of the series it mostly goes by the original script, but by the end they are completely off the rails. It is a fun ride!!

It's actually funny, some ghosts are genuinely creepy, and the characters are easily likable. Don't take it seriously, as this is more of a poke at English dubs than a true horror show. Get a group of friends together, put this on, and laugh your asses off.",1501372800,,747,4.335714285714285

3013285,5,B000Y7WGT2,"Im relatively new to anime which means I sometimes make a blind purchase.  I had seen a blurb about Ghost Stories somewhere and when I saw it on Amazon, I thought Id give it a try.  Well, the blurb hadnt mentioned anything about it being a spoof-type series.  I originally hit play and only paid vague attention until about three minutes in when I heard grandpa mutter, When this bitch kicks, Im moving to Vegas.  By episode two, I was hitting the internet trying to figure out if this show was for real.  Turns out it is but it isnt.  Its a real show but with an English script that takes a tour through crazy town.  And its fantastic.  Its a bit like Mystery Science Theater 3000 if they took over all the dialog of a movie.

Dont expect an award-winning dramatic anime.  The plots are silly and the dub often pushes it into straight ridiculous.  And if you're easily offended, this series is not for you.  But who says we cant have a little mindless fun once in a while?  Ghost Stories is great for a laugh and full of quotable lines.  I was going to end with one of those quotes but all the ones I can think of are inappropriate!  Enjoy!",1485734400,3,1141,4.266355140186916

(so why give it 5 stars?)  Because this is the best anime comedy English dub in history!!  These actors were given free reign to say whatever the hell they wanted, AND IT TURNED OUT WONDERFUL!  This show IS (in English) insulting, course, vulgar, and gives political correct-ness the finger from start to finish (actually the dub gets more outrageous as the series progresses).  In it's original Japanese version, this is easily a candidate (if not the poster child) for the worst anime ever; like of all time.  BUT, here comes the English dub, and suddenly it's art!  If you haven't gathered the idea from my description so far, this is NOT FOR KIDS.  You can see this online but I still had to make it part of my collection.  Buy it and ruin your inner child, it's worth it, go ahead, all the cool kids are doing it.",1482192000,11,990,4.548022598870056

The English series is rampant with jokes that keep you laughing while keeping the story intact.

For those sub puritans, you miss out on the SNL style humor, but aren't entirely lacking comedy, you just need to be little smarter to laugh at it.",1446076800,2,478,4.569767441860465

3013327,5,B000Y7WGT2,"I absolutely love this anime.  I hadn't heard of it until I attended Greg Ayres' panel at Anime Boston this year and he told the story of what happened with this show - how the American distribution company was going through a rough patch and figured they wouldn't be around much longer, so they got permission from the Japanese production company to do whatever they wanted with the dub as long as they kept the character names and stuck to the basic outline of the story.  Then they turned the voice actors loose on the thing, and what we got was a mostly ad-libbed, utterly hilarious show replete with plenty of digs, jabs, and zings at pop culture (""Remember when Christian Slater had a career?""), at anime itself (""Leave me alone, I'm doing my standard anime elbows-up pose""), at bible-thumpers and at each other and pretty much everything else under the sun.  The cast - Hilary Haag, Monica Rial, Chris Patton, Greg Ayres, and all the supporting folk, hit a home run with it and show just how talented they are.

This is hands down the funniest anime I've ever seen and I highly recommend it to anyone who wants a good laugh.",1436313600,31,1131,4.556650246305419

You know those shows that have quotes you like so much that you end up using them in regular life? That's what this anime does. It's so full of self-mockery, satire of pop culture, jabs at each other as voice actors, and other hijinks that you can't help but get addicted. I suspect the original dialogue would be boring as heck, but the dub just let them go off in any direction, no holds barred.

3013363,4,B000Y7WGT2,If this is the series I've seen it is dubbed they listed here as Japanese only it's also listed on Right-Stuf as dubbed just to let you know and it is a good dub. The story starts with two of our main characters moving back to the city their parents are from with their father their mother has died and despite that she has a big role in this series. Satsuki and her little cry-baby brother who is trying to bring the family cat to their first day of school which is a building right next to the old school building Satsuki finds the cat but it get's away from them and runs into the old school building where she finds an old book from her mother that tells how to fight ghosts and spirits as they try to find the cat it becomes possessed by a spirit and is a part of the series from now on. The main comedy comes from all the reference's to movie stars and making fun of Satsuki's little brother and some mild sexual reference's which get a lot more adult as you get to the middle of this series towards the end these get even more adult with F-bombs and more adult reference's which would be rated R or T.V. mature I am assuming this hasn't been redubbed. I liked this series the reference's were mostly funny and the adult humor was mostly o.k. the animation is old style and I enjoyed the characters and the ghosts and spirits!

I find this anime is a bit divisive - those I know who have seen it either love it or think it's stupid. I am obviously in the love it camp. When low on funds, I found myself talked into selling this set for some quick cash... and I've regretted it since. Seriously, check this one out if you like re-dub humor.",1357430400,,502,4.294736842105263
3013377,5,B000Y7WGT2,"Ok, this anime might be the funniest damn thing I've ever seen. Ghost Stories was made in 2000 by Aniplex and Pierrot,and licensed here in the states by ADVision.
The story is about a girl,Satsuki, who has just moved to her deceased mothers hometown. There she meets a few kids from the town and they soon end up locked inside the towns old schoolhouse.
While looking for Satsukis' pet cat, they run into a ghost that had been sealed away in the school by Satsukis' mother.
They find a book her mother used to seal ghosts away when she was alive and accidently seal it away in her pet cat.

Ok, so that might sound like the start of a ghost hunting anime adventure, and it is, but what really makes this series is the reversioning of the plot and storyline. Some things were asked to be kept in the series, like the traditional Japanese ghost story legends etc. But, other than that, ADV said...take it and do what you will!

And, what they did was a hilarious,offensive and remarkable bit of anime gold.

The voice actors, Hilary Haag, Monica Rial, Greg Ayres, Chris Patton and Christine Auten do an unbelievable job at making you laugh your butt off.

Now,it can be offensive to some, as there are sex jokes,gay jokes,religious jokes etc. So a warning on that. However if you are into funny pop culture jokes and the like, you'll get many laughs outta this show.

Overall, I gotta say what they did with it was great. Highly Recommended!",1298851200,2,1439,4.519230769230769
3013378,5,B000Y7WGT2,"Probably one of the most hilarious things you'll ever see. A bunch of English anime dubbers decided to throw in their own jokes when the time came to localize this and the result is priceless. I don't even like anime and I couldn't stop laughing for days.

3013379,5,B000Y7WGT2,"In this great little release that fits right on the shelf, is a perfectly hilarious thing.  Hearkening back to Woody Allen's ""What's Up, Tiger Lily?"", and perhaps even the spirit of ""Fractured Flickers"", the main thing about this release is that the folks at ADV have delivered a great little bundle of reworked hilarity just about completely revising, rewriting, and improvising a ""new"" English dub over the original Japanese.  The dub on this set is great in that not only does it work in modern pop culture references, including ""LOST"" (!) but also makes it fit into the story arc!

This release is not for the kiddies, but for college humor, and/ or people that like their humor rich and raw!  It's a relieving take on ordinary dubs, and I highly recommend brushing up on other self-reflexive titles like the above, if you haven't already!  The original Japanese dub is fair and square, has its share of insight, but becomes practically bland when compared to this English dub.

If you like tired pop culture references which are quickly outdated, or pathetic ad-libs by voice actors, you will enjoy the ADV dub.

If you are not a connoisseur of pop culture or an avid watcher of television many of the jokes will mean nothing, which detracts from the viewing experience.

3013382,4,B000Y7WGT2,A wonderful story though unlike some critics I would hardly say that the English version is better than the Japanese original version. The English version deal with adult jokes on religion and sexuality that alters the concept of the series more and more as the episodes move alone. Either in original language or in English though it still great. Its about a group of kids who make the spirits in the old school on the property next to their new school and their attempts to put the ghosts back to sleep when they stat haunting the whole town.,1242086400,,544,4.561224489795919

You will laugh your freaking head off. I still cannot stop suggesting this to my friends. I am buying this DVD set so I can have a viewing party over some brewskies.

3247719,5,B000Y7WGT2,"The year was 2005. It was the year of Batman Begin-ning, Resident Evil returning for the fourth time, and Stephen Colbert taking the nation by storm. At the ADV offices, the guys in charge of buying licenses were getting pissed-drunk in celebration of the 6th re-release of the Platinum Evangelion edition DVDs. In their inebriated states, they somehow purchased the rights to release a God-awful, cheesey, cliched kids show about ghosts. After the rays of morning (and the passing of their massive hangovers) had brought their folly to light, these intrepid office workers desperately sought to find some way of saving their all too doomed jobs and keeping their 401k's.

Thankfully, desperation often breeds genius, and this is the case with Ghost Stories. With the dub, they decided to get rid of the original script's dialogue and transform the somewhat morbid children's genre drama and turn it into an over the top and hilarious comedy. Make no mistake, this is not kid's stuff. This is adult humor at its bawdiest. If the idea of elementary school kids trash talking about sex, the mentally handicapped, homosexuals, religion, sex, beastiality, sex, the nation's broken health care system, sex, and old people offends you greatly, then this is not the show for you. Go watch some high-brow anime like Kino's Journey or some Miyazaki. This is low-brow gutter humor at its gourmet finest.

THINGS THAT MAY OFFEND: Kids cursing; numerous pre-teen panty shots, dead animals; dead people; dead animals having sex with dead people (kidding, maybe); anti-Christian rhetoric; anti-Jewish rhetoric; anti-Muslim rhetoric; anti-EVERYBODY rhetoric; gay retarded little brothers; dead lesbian mothers; evil talking cats; a fifth-grade boy who sounds like a 30 year old but retains the horniness of said fifth-grade boy; disturbingly hot female ghosts (don't judge me); more pop culture references than Buffy the Vampire Slayer and a new Doctor Who episode penned by Russel T. Davies COMBINED.",1227657600,56,1986,5.261829652996846
3247720,5,B000Y7WGT2,Anyone who doesn't think this is funny has absolutely zero sense of humor and should be watching soap operas or reading a historical novel. This is not a heart warming story about a family whose wife died. Its the funniest anime I have ever watched. More than all the 300 Anime movies I have in my collection put together. It really pokes fun at nerds and straight laced political correct snobs. It made me realize how brainwashed Americans are that we can't even poke fun at ourselves. This is NOT about a family trying to adjust after a mother dies. The family is perfectly adjusted to the mother being dead and have moved on even joking about the dead mother --which has nothing to do with the theme. A group of kids go into the old haunted school house looking for their lost cat and the adventure starts. I have 600 movies and 300 anime in my collection and this is the first movie that has made me laugh out loud. Ghost stories describes itself as wicked fun. A reluctant ghost hunter. Her babbling baby brother. A horny pre-teen. Its 5 discs not 1 and contains 1-20 episodes--each a separate ghost adventure -- 550 minutes long. This anime is so funny I am watching it twice and may even watch it 3 times. I recommend it for anyone who is sick and tired of political correct authoritarians ruling their lives. No holds barred comedy. English dubbed voices and translations are great. Totally funny!!!,1226880000,,1407,4.565217391304348

I had seen a blurb about Ghost Stories somewhere and when I saw it on Amazon, I thought Id give it a try.  Well, the blurb hadnt mentioned anything about it being a spoof-type series.  I originally hit play and only paid vague attention until about three minutes in when I heard grandpa mutter, When this bitch kicks, Im moving to Vegas.  By episode two, I was hitting the internet trying to figure out if this show was for real.  Turns out it is but it isnt.  Its a real show but with an English script that takes a tour through crazy town.  And its fantastic.  Its a bit like Mystery Science Theater 3000 if they took over all the dialog of a movie.

Dont expect an award-winning dramatic anime.  The plots are silly and the dub often pushes it into straight ridiculous.  And if you're easily offended, this series is not for you.  But who says we cant have a little mindless fun once in a while?  Ghost Stories is great for a laugh and full of quotable lines.

This show IS (in English) insulting, course, vulgar, and gives political correct-ness the finger from start to finish (actually the dub gets more outrageous as the series progresses).  In it's original Japanese version, this is easily a candidate (if not the poster child) for the worst anime ever; like of all time.  BUT, here comes the English dub, and suddenly it's art!

I hadn't heard of it until I attended Greg Ayres' panel at Anime Boston this year and he told the story of what happened with this show - how the American distribution company was going through a rough patch and figured they wouldn't be around much longer, so they got permission from the Japanese production company to do whatever they wanted with the dub as long as they kept the character names and stuck to the basic outline of the story.  Then they turned the voice actors loose on the thing, and what we got was a mostly ad-libbed, utterly hilarious show replete with plenty of digs, jabs, and zings at pop culture (""Remember when Christian Slater had a career?""), at anime itself (""Leave me alone, I'm doing my standard anime elbows-up pose""), at bible-thumpers and at each other and pretty much everything else under the sun.

Satsuki and her little cry-baby brother who is trying to bring the family cat to their first day of school which is a building right next to the old school building Satsuki finds the cat but it get's away from them and runs into the old school building where she finds an old book from her mother that tells how to fight ghosts and spirits as they try to find the cat it becomes possessed by a spirit and is a part of the series from now on. The main comedy comes from all the reference's to movie stars and making fun of Satsuki's little brother and some mild sexual reference's which get a lot more adult as you get to the middle of this series towards the end these get even more adult with F-bombs and more adult reference's which would be rated R or T.V. mature I am assuming this hasn't been redubbed.

The story is about a girl,Satsuki, who has just moved to her deceased mothers hometown. There she meets a few kids from the town and they soon end up locked inside the towns old schoolhouse.
While looking for Satsukis' pet cat, they run into a ghost that had been sealed away in the school by Satsukis' mother.
They find a book her mother used to seal ghosts away when she was alive and accidently seal it away in her pet cat.

Ok, so that might sound like the start of a ghost hunting anime adventure, and it is, but what really makes this series is the reversioning of the plot and storyline. Some things were asked to be kept in the series, like the traditional Japanese ghost story legends etc. But, other than that, ADV said...take it and do what you will!

And, what they did was a hilarious,offensive and remarkable bit of anime gold.

The voice actors, Hilary Haag, Monica Rial, Greg Ayres, Chris Patton and Christine Auten do an unbelievable job at making you laugh your butt off.

Now,it can be offensive to some, as there are sex jokes,gay jokes,religious jokes etc. So a warning on that. However if you are into funny pop culture jokes and the like, you'll get many laughs outta this show.

The dub on this set is great in that not only does it work in modern pop culture references, including ""LOST"" (!) but also makes it fit into the story arc!

This release is not for the kiddies, but for college humor, and/ or people that like their humor rich and raw!  It's a relieving take on ordinary dubs, and I highly recommend brushing up on other self-reflexive titles like the above, if you haven't already!

3247878,3,B000Y7WGT2,"I am giving this a three because the original script was good, but the ADV dub sucks.

If you like tired pop culture references which are quickly outdated, or pathetic ad-libs by voice actors, you will enjoy the ADV dub.

If you are not a connoisseur of pop culture or an avid watcher of television many of the jokes will mean nothing, which detracts from the viewing experience.

Fortunately, the original Japanese audio and subtitles are on the discs.

I wish the Animax dub was available on DVD, since their English dub is true to the original script.",1255564800,5,554,4.622448979591836
3247879,4,B000Y7WGT2,A wonderful story though unlike some critics I would hardly say that the English version is better than the Japanese original version. The English version deal with adult jokes on religion and sexuality that alters the concept of the series more and more as the episodes move alone. Either in original language or in English though it still great. Its about a group of kids who make the spirits in the old school on the property next to their new school and their attempts to put the ghosts back to sleep when they stat haunting the whole town.,1242086400,,544,4.561224489795919

If you like your humor racy, don't mind the F-Bomb being blasted out from time to time and listening to every ethnic group or stereotype being made fun of, then this DVD set is for you. You will laugh your freaking head off. I still cannot stop suggesting this to my friends. I am buying this DVD set so I can have a viewing party over some brewskies. It is great watching the reaction of 1st time viewers of this series. I am chuckling inside just thinking about the reactions.

8231162,5,B000Y7WGT2,"Just buy this. If you love anime parodies from Team Four Star, WeeklyTubeShow, etc. you'll love the dub of this. It's comedic gold. The voice actors had an amazing amount of leeway to improvise the script as long as they kept the basic story intact. The original story is below mediocre so you'll most certainly not be missing much but the original Japanese voice acting along with complimenting subtitles are available for them if you want to listen to the sub. My only gripe is the lack of subtitles for the english voice acting.",1509408000,,531,4.659574468085107
8231163,5,B000Y7WGT2,"Contains both the hilarious dub and the original sub. Any anime-lover, both sub/dub, need to see this and enjoy it. Older series however, so expect it to seem a bit outdated or not always fit on larger screens.",1507852800,,210,4.552631578947368
8231164,5,B000Y7WGT2,The DVD itself was good. Only downfall is that it comes with the dub but no dubtitles. My deaf brother won't be able to tell why I'm laughing so hard. I was really hoping to share this with him :(,1507593600,2,196,3.925
8231165,5,B000Y7WGT2,"Let me tell you just how good this show is: I bought this maybe around a month ago, and I've watched it four times already. I don't always bust out laughing at tv shows, but this has me in hysterics every time. I'm honestly surprised I've never woken up anyone laughing in the middle of the night. This is by far my favorite English dub ever, and the English dub has made this one of my favorite animes of all time!

Not only is the hilarious script great, but this is also some of the best voice acting I've ever heard. This anime really showcases just how skilled all these actors are. If you think you've heard all of Greg Ayres and Monica Rial's characters before, then this will surprise you. The voices are all perfect and add so much personality to the characters. It's really hard to believe that it wasn't originally written for such a hilarious script. The entire script is one joke after another, without a second's pause. A LOT of the jokes are pretty offensive, but don't get your light blue Hanes in a bunch, because it's all in good fun.

I'm sad that it's only 20 episodes short, because every time I watch through it, I crave more! There are no special features on this set, not even clean opening or closing animation, but the anime itself is golden enough that it doesn't matter.

I've watched a little bit in the original Japanese just to see the difference, and...wow...no wonder it didn't do well over there. While some scenes in the English dub fill in the scenery shots with random banter, the original Japanese dub will often just have silence (I guess to set a more solemn tone?) The original Japanese actors are more plain, and don't have the same fantastic reactions that the English actors do. Keiichiro is the most disappointing in the Japanese dub, and the age difference between him and the older kids is less obvious, whereas the English dub, he is hilarious, and his actress does a wonderful job of making him speak how an actual 4 year old would. As you get closer to the end of the series, the English dub just get raunchier and raunchier, and they constantly break the 4th wall commenting about how the original script doesn't make any sense. ""Damn anime, look what's happened to my eyes!""

Just make sure when you watch this that no actual kids are in the room. I can't imagine what kind of language a kid might pick up from this one. If Matt Stone and Trey Parker (South Park) were given an anime to dub over, this is what you'd get.",1505520000,2,2472,4.462389380530974
