1640866,3,B00005OCK8,"I saw this documentary at the 20th anniversary screening of ""The Stunt Man"" at LA's Egyptian Theatre last year. It is a low-budget DV affair consisting of the director, Richard Rush, describing the endless process of getting the film made and released and the various individuals who tried to prevent him along the way. It is shot as an homage to the visually inventive style of ""The Stunt Man"", full of camera tricks and transitions. Being a huge fan of the film, I was fascinated; those who are less interested in this sort of story may find it overlong and overblown.
To me, ""The Stunt Man"" is one of the best (if not the best) films made about the film industry; I've seen it many many times and am delighted that a DVD is finally being released. This documentary is a fine companion piece and true to the hall of mirrors theme, it's a film about making a film about making a film...

7948654,5,B00005OCK8,"The technical clunkiness of effects of this film shot on video in 2000 is sometimes distracting for me--especially now with all the video sophistication afford to everyone with a phone these days--but the content and the imaginative way it is presented equals what was done for the film it discusses, the making of The Stunt Man. If you're a fan of the film or just interested in the techniques and production politics of the film industry, it is well worth a look.

I gave it five stars instead of the four I originally put (subtracted because of the distraction of the 90s video effects) because I realized that as I was watching it to fill the time in my sick bed unable to sleep, I ended up all the way to the edge of the bed, sitting up, totally engrossed in Richard Rush's retelling of the production and exhibition attempts of the film.",1426032000,2,843,4.509803921568627
7948655,5,B00005OCK8,"I really enjoyed this DVD because I've always liked seeing how the movies I've loved were made, that's probably why I go to Universal Studios in Los Angeles Ca. every year on vacation and take the tour.",1374192000,,202,4.486486486486487
7948656,1,B00005OCK8,The only good things about this documentary are Peter O'Toole and the score by Dominic Frontiere. Just like the movie. Cheesy documentary- not even for the hardcore Stuntman or O'Toole fans. Not well done.,1372118400,,205,5.0588235294117645

ludicrously hokey framework.

7948658,5,B00005OCK8,"This is certainly the best behind-the scenes, ""the making of"" movie I've seen. Fascinating story. If you love ""The Stunt Man"", you will love this movie. If you've never seen ""The Stunt Man"", you will likely still enjoy this, and then want to see it.",1319155200,6,249,4.555555555555555
7948659,5,B00005OCK8,"A lot of people really don't get The Stunt Man. It's at turns exciting, heart-warming and obscene. And by the end, it's more thought provoking than anything else. Although as beautifully filmed as anything that came out of the old Hollywood studio system, it deals with themes of right & wrong and shifting reality, that tend to, as it thrills us with the action & explosions, make us damned uncomfortable. That said, I loved this documentary! Richard Rush was having a good time, and let us at least a third the way into his head. It was great imagining him one afternoon having a young Steve Railsback into his house for an impromptu audition. All the actors when speaking of the experience of filming the movie became as wide-eyed & excited as children. You get a sense of what a great time this was for them. If you want to relive the thrill of first seeing The Stunt Man, this funny, loving documentary will give that to you. It's absolutely icing on the frigging cake.",1297468800,2,974,4.571428571428571
7948660,1,B00005OCK8,"What could have been a fascinating documentary about the making of a brilliant film is sabotaged by amateurish camera work, not-so-special ""effects"" and a script delivered by a director who comes off (though not necessarily is) fascinated more with himself than the film.  It is cheesy and unending and makes any information about the film secondary to the ""artistic"" effect they were going for.  If you took out all the needless narration, there is probably about ten minutes of interesting info about the film, but you have to wade through so much muck to get to it, it becomes frustrating.  The Stunt Man was a brilliant, layered film.  This documentary (or is it a mocumentary) is trying so hard to be as edgy and multidimensional as the film that it ultimately comes off as bloated, amateurish and uninteresting.  In short, this film is nothing like The Stunt Man and any good will carried over by that brilliant picture is burned away by an overabundance of pretentiousness.",1241308800,3,980,4.879518072289157
7948661,2,B00005OCK8,"The Stuntman is a masterpiece, a great vehicle for a great actor. The Making of ... came with the film as a bonus. If you are really interested in the machinations behind the scenes in Hollywood (I am not), then this may be of some interest to you. I will not bother watching it again and would rather have just the movie a couple of dollars cheaper.",1224460800,3,350,4.2388059701492535
7948662,3,B00005OCK8,"Richard Rush's ""The Stunt Man"" is one of the most original, intelligent, and exhilarating films ever made. It also has one of the most fascinating back-stories in movie history, with a tumultuous production and distribution history that rivals ""Titanic"" and ""Citizen Kane"".
It's too bad that ""The Sinister Saga of Making 'The Stunt Man'"" is one of the most agonizingly cheesy documentaries I've ever seen.  It resembles a childrens' science television show, with an overuse of  annoying and disgustingly ""cute"" visual gimmicks. It looks like the work of a recent graduate of a community college videography class, with too much time and equipment on their hands. Sadly, the documentary was directed by Rush himself.
So is this documentary worth seeing? Absolutely, if only because the back-story is so compelling. However, Rush could have saved a lot of time and money merely filming himself delivering the same information as a straight lecture. The approach used here is nearly unbearable.",1010534400,12,991,5.265822784810126
