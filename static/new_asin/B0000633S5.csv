Here the english voices are not re-dubbed ( they re-dubbed the voices of majin buu in the orange brick version which is cropped, etc), and the disc offers the original japanese cast.",1392940800,,254,4.3125

A new hope rises!",1021161600,2,454,4.317647058823529
7958382,5,B0000633S5,"Amazon has the explanations of ""Tactics"" and ""Revival"" mixed up. So ""Evil Lives On"", ""Find the Dragon Balls"", and ""Revival"" are really the episodes from Revival, while ""Global Announcement"", ""Learn to Fuse"", and ""The Z Sword"" are the episodes from Tactics. So hey, I could have just saved you from buying the wrong DVD. So give me some money and we'll call it even.
Bah, nevermind what I said.  They seem to have fixed it.",1017619200,,422,4.626666666666667
7958383,3,B0000633S5,"Hi, i saw this video and i don't think it's that good , coz there is no fighting in it , in this tape there are 4 guys that we thought were dead but they're not,Piccolo goes back to where Vegita blew himself up,and sees majin buu regenerating and quickly runs off! , the second survivor is Gohan wich was found by Shin & Kibito(Kibito awakes by himself and Shin manages to escape from the battle feild while Vegita was Fighting Buu,the most coolest clip of the tape is when Gohan struggles to pull out the legendary Zed Sword , a sword that is stuck in the Kaioshin Kai planet for centuries , and at the same time Goku returns to Kami's lookout and Teaches Goten&Trunks how to fuse.",1011139200,8,682,4.294573643410852
