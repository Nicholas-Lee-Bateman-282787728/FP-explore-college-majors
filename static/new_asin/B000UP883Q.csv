2923590,5,B000UP883Q,"This film provides in interesting perspective on TED. First, it's about TED 2006, which means that the ideas presented have had time to come to fruition: a man introduces multi-touch, which has become the iPhone. Next, the film is about the whole TED experience, not just the 20 minute speeches: you can see how the speeches lead to collaboration. For instance, you see how Majora Carter goes from outsider to the board of directors of Al Gore's organization. You see Larry Brilliant go from a man with a powerful idea, to the man who runs google.org. You see how Bono combined with tech gurus to create a grass roots organization that advocates for Africa. It's not just ideas, it's about the power of people coming together to combine their passions and skills.

How much time have you spent finding problems that you care about deeply? How much time have you spent trying to find a way to solve those problems? TED is inspiring because the solutions are effective and clever, but not genius. If you haven't tried to solve big problems it's only because you didn't think to try. We are all clever enough. We all have something to contribute.",1229644800,2,1143,4.715
2923591,4,B000UP883Q,"the website has more content, but the DVD gives a better history. I love the concept, I like the narrative, but I was hoping for more of the presentations that were given at TED. I guess it all you could ask for in a two disk set. The web site is a great place to go for inspiration and guidance. [...]",1223251200,2,302,3.9672131147540983
2923592,2,B000UP883Q,"We will encounter some of the brightest minds and freshest thinking and reduce them to 30 second sound bites and  fill the bulk of the movie with meaningless, self promoting drivel from the current TED director and the adventures of the host as she gets coffee and goes to the beach.

Save your money and watch the presentations for free from the TED website.",1213920000,4,359,4.59375
2923593,5,B000UP883Q,"For no other reason than the immense lack of substance and truth in our media, this is refreshing, invigorating and and hopeful.  It's grown-up stuff of the highest quality.  If you don't really want to think, watch the news and they'll do it for you. But if you'd rather reclaim that job for yourself, and can appreciate that others have gone to the trouble too, then you'll really enjoy this.  Lots of exciting ideas!",1211155200,2,419,4.635135135135135
2923594,5,B000UP883Q,"This is a documentary I would recommend to almost anyone interested in technology, the environment and finding solutions to many of the world's most pressing problems. The TED conference is an annual event of short talks by leading scientists, business leaders and others with innovative ideas for making positive changes.

This fairly short film only shows a snapshot of the conference. I'd like to have an unabridged version. Still, the pieces shown are inspiring and thought provoking. The presenters include Al Gore, Anthony Robbins, Matt Groenig, as well as representatives from companies such as Netflix and Amazon. Of course, the most impressive and radical presentations were not made by any of the latter, but by lesser known geniuses in the sciences, technology and architecture.  I found it a little annoying that Gore, who was given an extra chance to speak at the end (and attempted a kind of stand-up routine), was treated like the star of the whole conference. Whatever you think of Gore as a politician and environmentalist, I think he is more of a spokesperson for  ideas than a genuine innovator or visionary himself. Still, I suppose that's the way the world works; it's necessary to have well known people to spread important ideas and politicians are generally better equipped to do this than techies, scientists and computer wizards, no matter how brilliant.

Some of the ideas presented include a plan to make $100 laptops available to all students; preventing the outbreak of future pandemics such as bird flu; new architectural models to combat homelessness around the world; creating safer burning fuels than charcoal, which apparently kills many people with its toxicity; a model for computer screens that respond to two-handed motions to replace the mouse...these are only a few highlights I recall.

The TED conference also has an online community that you can join to stay updated about some of the most creative and positive developments in the world (just do a search for TED). With all of the negative and anxiety-producing news that comes out every day, this kind of thinking is especially needed.",1206230400,6,2131,5.112068965517241
2923595,5,B000UP883Q,"This will inspire you to create more, aim higher, get together with others who want to get things done, and go do it!  This DVD is a well-crafted window into the world of high-energy collaboration of some of the world's most successful people.

2923596,5,B000UP883Q,"This film does a great job of introducing people to one of the many gatherings taking place to work on a wide-range of pressing issues.
TED is one of the more exclusive gatherings, with tickets costing several hundred dollars, so this DVD provides the viewer a ""pass"" for just a few dollars.  One of my favorite segments featured a person in Brooklyn who is working to green her neighborhood.
In addition to the TED conference, there are gatherings like the Green Festivals, various sustainable living events, ""peak oil"" conferences, international events like the ""World Social Forum"", the Bioneers conference&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Bioneers-Declarations-of-Interdependence/dp/1890132764/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Bioneers: Declarations of Interdependence</a>&nbsp;and much else.

2923599,5,B000UP883Q,"A fantastic DVD with some of the worlds brightest thinkers and doers.  I rented from netflix and have preordered a copy from Amazon.  Highlights from very intelligent 20 minute conference talks - covering topics of creativity, and proposed solutions to world problems.  The TED conference brings movers and shakers together, then real world organizations and solutions are realized.  It was also refreshing to see the ""follow-up"", and what has been done since the 2006 conference.  It is wonderful that this conference is finally getting some exposure - outside of the 1000 ""invite only"" attendees. See also ted.com",1191283200,11,615,5.298969072164948

8214170,2,B000UP883Q,"I am a huge TED fan--BUT this movie is very dated---
I believe it is a 2006 TED conference.
Product not worth it",1356393600,,112,3.9130434782608696
8214171,5,B000UP883Q,"If, like me, you love watching the YouTube videos of TED lectures, you will be completely enthralled by this movie. It is all about the 2006 TED convention. That's four days in Monterey, California, with one thousand of the smartest, most creative, most capable people you can imagine. Al Gore was there, and gave the speech which grew into his documentary, ""An Inconvenient Truth."" I'm sorry I don't recall names very well, but the ideas were far more stimulating than the name-dropping. Many were people who are innovators in fields I barely knew existed, such as an entirely new way to manipulate data on a computer monitor. In fact, I get the feeling one of them grew into the intuitive interface which is now common on hand-held computer devices. There were a couple of architects with such ideas as how to do ""open source design"" for buildings people can build themselves of local materials.

Much of the key to TED's success is the internet and the revolution in communications technology. So it's not too surprising that executives from several major technology companies were there. One of the reasons for the TED conferences is to bring together great ideas and the people who have money to invest in them.

A highlight of the conference is the TED awards. Three people were told six months ahead of time that they were to be honored, and told to prepare a wish to present to the conference. The idea is that if you think big, these are the people who can make it happen.

There was also a good bit of sheer entertainment, including music and dance, and a lot of partying. It certainly made me wish I was fit to be invited to some future conference. And maybe that's an important part of the point: not just bringing the best and brightest together, but inspiring people to do their best and brightest in order to earn the opportunity to be involved in such a stimulating event.

TED gives me hope that we can move forward, solving the world's problems with creativity, awareness, and cooperation.",1336608000,,2007,4.7094017094017095
8214172,5,B000UP883Q,"The planting of seeds.  Working together.  Following our passions.  Honoring each other.  Connecting to others.
This film allows you to not just be inspired by the TED talks that are so inspiring  but to be inspired by the witnessing of the creation of TED.  To go behind the scenes and feel the connections and yearnings that people have to make a difference allowed me to feel how inspiration manifests itself.  This film is beautifully done and is a masterpiece itself in how it weaves so many different parts of an incredible whole.  Thank you!",1310169600,,548,4.75531914893617

8214175,5,B000UP883Q,I was expecting a flood of techies promising us new gadgets to guide us toward nirvana. Apparently TED once might have looked that way.
