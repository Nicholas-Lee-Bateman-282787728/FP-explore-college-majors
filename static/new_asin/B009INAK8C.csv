5340092,5,B009INAK8C,"Enjoyed this one. The surpising action, the making freinds with the bride.
The bride and her becoming friends and helping each other.

And she stes the guy in the end.

I would recommend this to anyone.",1356220800,2,202,4.583333333333333
5340093,3,B009INAK8C,"I loved the opening scene that segued into a meeting with the new Texas millionaire client. He wants a bodyguard for his spoiled daughter's wedding and the hotshot female bodyguard hates the assignment from the get-go.  This is a film that immerses you in wedding saccherine and at the same time tells a good story. I laughed a lot.  The movie wasn't exactly realism, but there was enough character development and mystery about who was threatening the bride's life that I had fun watching it.",1354147200,26,493,4.788235294117647

5340144,3,B009INAK8C,"A pleasant, uninspiring romantic comedy that poses as a mystery but neglects many of the elements of that genre, making who-done-it a moot point.  The plot follows a silly airhead (Nicole Paggi as Daisy) about to get married.  Shes received threats, so her snooty Texas tycoon daddy (Gregory Harrison) hires a bodyguard (Brooke Burns as Tanya) to protect his precious little darlin.  Theres a hitch though, a predictable conflict of disinterest, Tanya was dumped at the altar so she has a very dim view of weddings and doesnt want the job.  But, being a professional, she gets a do-it-or-else order from her boss and suddenly Tanya is a bridesmaid.  They try to milk her wedding aversion for all its worth........the trouble is, it isn't worth much as far as humor goes.  And they quickly lose sight of the real reason shes there.  It isn't until the very end that they bother to return to their original premise.  In between, they play football, go skeet shooting, flirt, dance, take a hayride.............  But eventually, the writers remembered they set up a real threat for the characters to contend with.......oh by the way!

It feels slapdash, like they just threw some stuff together and called it a movie.  What they ended up with is pleasant enough, just not very filling.",1454198400,,1281,4.857142857142857

I buy a lot of movies, but try and limit the prices I pay. I, recently, bought ten movies that averaged $5, each,
(I have to pay 20% import taxes into Germany from America).
My favorites were:
1.)- THIS one (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Undercover-Bridesmaid-Hallmark/dp/B009INAK8C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Undercover Bridesmaid (Hallmark)</a>).

""Undercover Bridesmaid"" is an action/adventure/romance movie with, the easy-on-the-eyes, Brooke Burns, and the capable
Gregory Harrison as the father of the bride.

No plot spoilers here---The Editorial Product Descriptions tell you WHAT the movies are about--- I'm just giving my recommen-
dation for all three movies.
----
The stand-out actress in ""THE NANNY EXPRESS"" movie is the girl that plays the AWFUL brat teenage daughter. You'll HATE
her right till the last two scenes! The actress that plays the teacher/nanny was wonderful... and very pretty.
All of the actors were DELIGHTFULLY capable in their roles. The young boy becomes a likable character waaaay before his sister.
Familiar faces: Dean Stockwell and Stacy Keach are key to the plot, and the male love-interest was a convincing actor as well.
----
Kiernan Shipka steals every scene she is in ""Smooch"". Her, believable, acting skills are w-a-a-a-a-y beyond her years.

5340291,3,B009INAK8C,"I love Hallmark movies. Most times they are convoluted, extremely traditional, feel-good, and yes corny too. I kinda love that. I usually spend my Sundays watching corny Hallmark movie after corny Hallmark movie, even if I've seen what they are playing 10 times already. I'm also not a religious person but I do love heartwarming movies that my children can enjoy with me, without worrying about having to pause the TV and usher them out upon a surprise ""love scene"" I never saw coming, or vile words flying out of someone's mouth for no other reason than 'cause they felt like it.
Undercover Bridesmaid has potential and I love the storyline, though it does remind me a tiny bit of some blockbuster movies that have been smashed together to make a made-for-TV copy-cat. I will say that the start of it was very comical, in the way in which Tanya fumbled through excuses to get out of this assignment she found worse than a shoot out in Kabul. She's allergic to weddings (it seems)...of course getting burned at the alter would do that do any woman. Brooke Burns towers over the other bridesmaids and the bride herself. I'm not sure if that was just coincidence or semi-purposeful to make her seem ""tougher"" than the dainty squealing and overly excited bridal party, but it worked.
I was actually kind of tickled to see Jay Kenneth Johnson and Martha Madison in this movie. Jay played Phillip on Days of Our Lives and Martha played his long time on again off again love interest Belle. It was kind of nice to have that ""Oh hey! Belle and Phillip"" moment for a second while watching this. In Undercover Bridesmaid Jay plays Chip, and Martha plays Sally....not very big roles but familiar faces are nice. It was nice in a ""wonder what they are up to these days"" kind of way.
The bride-to-be Daisy (played by Nicole Paggi) was bubbly and excitable. At first you're thinking- oh god....she's one of these ""happy all the time types"" that will end up getting on my nerves, but she ended up being a very nice, kind, and fun to watch character.
The mystery was fun to watch unfold, though at times seemed a bit silly and well...wouldn't you be more upset about someone threatening you than Daisy appeared to be?
The story between Tanya and Jake kind of dragged out a bit, considering how ""ice queen"" Tanya was and that took forever to start showing any potential. Jake sometimes seemed desperate to me, always getting in Tanya's way when she's trying to do her job....yeah undercover but still they guy was a bit homeless puppy on her for a bit- following her here and there.
The movie had some great hilarious moments and some touching ones too. It was corny in a good way.
The stuff I didn't care for were the OVER the top (IMHO) usage of Texas stereotypes. Boots, hats, fake accents, ""the bigger the better"" comments, even lassoing people... um....Whaaa? I'm a Texan, born and raised, we do things here like a lot of people do...no boots, no hats, no weirdly over the top accents, no random lassoing going on, just a classic lovely wedding w/out the stereotypical hoopla (though I'm sure there are exceptions!). lol. It's funny, but a bit much. I kind of had to roll my eyes a couple times, especially any scene with Daisy's father in it.

It's a nice little movie and it's fun and funny...but it's one that I don't think I'll feel compelled to watch over and over again like other Hallmark movies I've watched. In fact, when it's on again...I usually will skip it. I'm not saying it's a bad movie, it's not...it's just that once was enough or me.",1406851200,,3542,4.595576619273301

Harsin struggles to blend in with the bubbly, girly bridesmaids; this is not her typical assignment.

5340329,5,B009INAK8C,"I like good clean movies (or as clean as you can get nowadays). Undercover Bridesmaid was really quite clean. There was a few utterances of mild crude language; drinking alcohol in several scenes and smoking of a cigar; women wearing low cut shirts, kissing by a few couples, a woman thinks an engaged man was ""making out"" with the maid but she realizes later she misunderstood what was happening, a bride intimates she and her husband-to-be are waiting for marriage before having sex, and (since the star is a bodyguard) a girl receives several notes containing death threats, a woman uses kicks and punches, shoots images of criminals during target practice, a bomb is placed in a unique place but is detonated before it can hurt anyone and guns are seen in several scenes.  It is not rated and the Dove Foundation gave it a five star and approved it for 12+.

I really enjoyed the movie and will definitely watch it again.  I originally saw this movie on Hallmark Channel and bought it as soon as it came to DVD.  Most people would skip it because they think it is too predictable or ""lame"", but I like movies like that because I know I will be watching something that won't make me feel like I have just been ""slimed"".

I liked the two main characters, Tanya and Jake.  You get the impression that the bride that Tanya is hired to protect is at first really spoiled and ditsy, but as time goes on, you really like her as she befriends Tanya and tries to help her forgive and let go of her past.  Two of the three bridesmaids are way too bubbly and annoying if you ask me, but you get past it.

Overall, I loved this movie and will continue to watch it!",1369699200,3,1656,4.406557377049181

5340350,4,B009INAK8C,"A female security guard is assigned to be an undercover agent at a wedding. At that point she hated weddings after being jilted at the altar.

5340351,3,B009INAK8C,"I wouldn't be surprised if Tanya Harsin was thinking: ""W.W.S.B.F.M.C.D.?"" (""What would Sandra Bullock from Miss Congeniality do?"") When a Texan heiress, in the midst of her hectic wedding planning, receives threatening notes, best of the best security expert Tanya Harsin must become the Undercover Bridesmaid. Except that Tanya (Brooke Burns) happens to detest weddings, having been jilted at the altar some years ago. She pleads with her boss for an assignment in, say, the Middle East instead. But, nah, Tanya, as the sole female agent currently available in the security firm, proves too indispensable and fits in the best in the client's clique. But what happens when the impending bride, Daisy (Nicole Paggi), turns out to be this super-perky person who insists on befriending Tanya? Can the Undercover Bridesmaid maintain her icy professionalism? She's so still resenting what happened to her in the past that I'm betting: yes.

If you're wondering, there is an element of mystery. To some degree, the film does follow Tanya's sleuthing around. There's no dearth of credible suspects. The angry business partner? The groom with the roving eye? The aunt siphoning the family scholarship fund? Or maybe the groom's best friend who claims to be a law student, even though there are no records supporting his claim?

Hallmark Channel is self-promoted as ""the heart of television,"" and I guess 2012's UNDERCOVER BRIDESMAID is more rom-com than it is any other genre. Still, whiffs of THE BODYGUARD and MISS CONGENIALITY are inescapable. I confess that I enjoyed Brooke Burns' performance in another Hallmark venture (THE MOST WONDERFUL TIME OF THE YEAR) more so than what she does here. Partly, it's because her character is so sour grapes and takes so long to thaw out that by the time I was able to connect with her, more than half the film had elapsed. Too, the most likable character, surprisingly, is the bride-in-waiting Daisy who is so warm and sunny she easily overcomes the initial impression she'd set as this vacuous person. You - or, at least, I - wanted her to humor Daisy because Daisy is so lovable and sincere and has so much heart. So don't be startled should you find yourself connecting more with the bride than with the hard-bitten fake bridesmaid.

UNDERCOVER BRIDESMAID does have its share of good moments, mostly revolving around the supremely  uncomfortable Tanya's exposure to giggly sisterhood hugs, dressing paper dolls with toilet paper, and other wacky bridesmaid activities. Credit Brooke Burns for demonstrating familiarity with weaponry and combat techniques. It's not her fault that there isn't enough solid material for her and her co-stars to work with.",1358899200,5,2690,5.120728929384966

5340353,4,B009INAK8C,"A light romantic comedy, suspense, kinda who done it- or will do it, wrapped up around a rich girl's wedding party.

Brooke Burns(who starred in the fun ""The Most Wonderful Time of the Year"") is hired to protect and find out who's out to do in the young bride to be.  As titled, she goes undercover as a reluctant bridesmaid, she has her own issues after being stood up at the alter.  There are plenty of suspects among the family members, and a potential romantic interest in a hunky, younger man, Justin Baldoni.  The ever watchable, but under-utilized, Gregory Harrison plays the patriarch.

There's some mild tension, action(Brooke Burns shooting a shotgun or running in high heels, pistol drawn; plus, she can do real push-ups!) and humor(although, nowhere near as funny as ""Miss Congeniality"") with well coiffured actors and backdrops; moreover, the mystery isn't totally obvious although the ultimate happy ending is.

Hallmark clean, but kids will find it totally boring.  Those of us who enjoy Hallmark films will be satisfied.",1358208000,19,1036,5.023391812865497
