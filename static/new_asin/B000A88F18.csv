I HAVE BEEN LOOKING FOR YANCY DERRINGER FOR A VERY LONG TIME AND HAVE NOT FOUND THE TV SERIES YET. THE ONLY ONES IN THIS SET ARE THE ONES PICTURED ON THE FRONT OF THE BOX. I WILL KEEP THIS SERIES BUT IT IS NOT, I REPEAT IT IS NOT JOCK MAHONEY OR YANCY DERRINGER.",1192492800,14,389,3.814814814814815
8281127,5,B000A88F18,"Jock Mahoney, was an athlete, he even played the role of Tarzan in one movie...

In this western set in New Orleans, he plays the roll of Yancy Derringer, a gambler with 'derringer' up his sleeve and supported by an Indian companion who never speaks, but uses only sign language, played by Jay X. Brands, and who was more than proficient with a knife.  Some of the scenes where he pins a man's sleeve to a wall, and one scene where Yancy is watching a card shark, gives a sign and the knife is thrown from a distance in the rear to Yancy's hand, is a feat of art.  The series was short-lived, but was a unique western of it's time.",1189728000,,631,4.198347107438017
