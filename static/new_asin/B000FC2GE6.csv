8120777,4,B000FC2GE6,"Probably because of its science fiction pedigree, this UK-produced series was typically positioned as a kid's show in the US market, airing in afternoons/early evenings.  A bit ironic, in view of the adult-ish themes of most episodes: espionage, political intrigue, crime and conspiracy, even drug dealing.  The thirteen season two episodes are presented on two discs; video transfers are crisp and clean with decent audio quality.

For the television Anglophile, these shows are a terrific video time capsule.  Episode guest slots are filled with a stellar array of the era's movie/TV talent: Barbara Shelley, Duncan Lamont, Derren Nesbitt, Charles Gray, Sarah Lawson, Michael Ripper, and many others - some almost forgotten today.  Also included is a delightful late fifties ambience, featuring staunchly British things like Hillman Minxes, Humber Super Snipes, and wonderful stock footage of RAF V-bombers roaring through the skies of cold war Britain.  Often there's even local color on tap (pun intended): in episode ""The Decoy"", several minutes of location footage are shot both inside and outside a quaintly tudoresque Thames-side public house, The London Apprentice (apparently still in existence, judging from the pub review websites).",1170288000,15,1244,5.590425531914893
