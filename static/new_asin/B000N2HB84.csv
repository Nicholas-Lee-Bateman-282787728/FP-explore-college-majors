8215014,5,B000N2HB84,"As its title suggests, this documentary film covers three broad strands of interest: biographical details on Meyerhold's life, his work in the theatre, and where the work stands in the broader context of the Russian Avant-garde. All three themes are interwoven into a compelling and informative narrative, illustrated with rare visual material (film and photo) from Moscow film archives.

The scope of Meyerhold's oeuvre is all too often reduced to the work on 'biomechanics' which accounts for a mere fraction of his experimentation as a director both with and after Stanislavski. Although the subject of biomechanics is clearly and cleverly addressed in the film - illustrated through contemporary studio work - it is rightly treated as a stage in the development of a life's work that, like no other, pioneered the symbolic role of the body in performance.

Sadly, as with so many artistic luminaries of his generation and provenance, Meyerhold fell prey to Stalin's purges and was executed by firing squad in 1940. With such scant English language video material on Meyerhold available in the public domain, this film offers a superb introduction to a master of theatre. I would strongly recommend it to anyone interested in Russian theatre, theatre in general, or the period of history under scrutiny.",1280361600,4,1306,5.214285714285714
8215015,1,B000N2HB84,"This video has NO MENU and NO CHAPTERS. It is 50 minutes long with no way of navigating through it. Also, there is truly annoying, angsty music behind the narrator through at least the first half of it. Some of the visuals are interesting historically, such as the footage of Stanislavski and some of the stills and moving images of Meyerhold's productions. The information got useful toward the middle and end of it. But this is definitely too expensive [...] for the amateurish production values on this DVD.",1270512000,5,510,4.806818181818182
