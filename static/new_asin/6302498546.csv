It all ends with a free-for-all brawl that includes more POV punch-shots than I've ever seen in my life. There are also some pretty freakin' egregious early '70s fashions on display here.

The director, Ismael Rodriguez, was also responsible for the fascinating allegorical drama ""The Boy and the Ball and the Hole in the Wall"" (1965) and co-directed the '50s giant monster sci-fi classic ""The Beast of Hollow Mountain.""

The title, by the way, translates as ""We the Ugly.""",1310515200,,854,5.181159420289855
