2728046,1,B000MC7NCE,"In Hell advertisement indicated scenes of beautiful women being subjected to some kind of torture. There was nothing like that in the movie. It was a dark movie with only a single female mostly hurting herself. It was more about terrorism than anything else. Pretty sad. Purchased at Amazon.

2728051,4,B000MC7NCE,"Don't be fooled, this is not exploitation and Papatakis is an auteur de rigueur. The film deals with politics, sadomasochism and filmaking, in a Godard/Fassbinder style. Olga Karlatos is at her best.",1391212800,23,199,5.25
8167714,1,B000MC7NCE,Couldn't get past the first 10 minutes. Adam West has a terrible German accent. Just speak English and forget trying to sound like a German speaking English. The Nazi's are on a boat and are attacked from the shore. The German troops might as well have stood up with targets on them. They were falling faster than I could keep track of. Adam West was dashing around like he was doing his Batman routine.  Just can't recommend a movie that starts out so poorly.  It is NOT a B movie.,1522972800,,482,4.344444444444444

8167716,4,B000MC7NCE,"Not the best WWII movie, but not the worst.  It's worth a watch to see Adam West (TV's Batman) as a Nazi, a good Nazi.  Not Tom Cruise in Valkyrie good Nazi but he does what he can.  On screw-up I have to report: there is a scene where a German tank's turret machine gun has an ammo can, writing is in English, it has CAL 50 as the ammo type.  The Germans did not use 50 caliber machine guns!!",1504396800,,393,3.875
8167717,3,B000MC7NCE,Worth the watch. Typical B war movie.,1503187200,,37,4.428571428571429
8167718,3,B000MC7NCE,"Just saw this movie on Prime.  All things considered, I enjoyed it.  The German uniforms were good, with M18 Hellcats and M8s standing in for German armor.  The battle scenes were decent as well.  Not ""Private Ryan"", but as a whole not a waste of viewing time either.",1501372800,,267,4.5
8167719,1,B000MC7NCE,The movie sucked!! Would not recommend. Jumps around and poor lighting.,1461542400,3,71,5.545454545454546

8167723,1,B000MC7NCE,"Really didn't like this film. Unless you are into a 90-minute political statement done by a masochist, I'd stay away.",1426550400,13,117,4.9
