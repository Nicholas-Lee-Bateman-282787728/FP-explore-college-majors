8077029,5,B000AA7MT2,"My husband and I used this video to supplement our waltz classes. I thought the instruction was outstanding, especially the instructors' attention to correct footwork, which is essential if you want to master the waltz's rise and fall.

Donald Johnson took a very no-nonsense approach to dancing that my husband appreciated. There was no false enthusiasm or encouragement that grates on his nerves. And I thought Kasia Kozak was a beautiful dancer, very elegant and graceful without the exaggerated ""styling"" you sometimes see. This is important since in the beginning you need to mimic a good dancer. If I look half as good as Kasia, I'll be thrilled.",1321833600,2,652,5.037037037037037
8077030,5,B000AA7MT2,"So far, this production is the best I have seen in overall content and presentation.  Here is a helpful, easy to follow, detailed practice companion for the motivated beginning dance student. The disk appeals to multiple learning styles.  The dance forms are easy to see (no black pants on black background).  The audio learners vill enjoy clear concise cueing and explanations.  The tactile learner will appreciate the progressive, follow along format. The couple's dance technique is solid and well defined.  I also appreciated the specific review on footwork and weighht changes.  I utilize this resource often in my own personal practice.  The Tango and Foxtrot dvds in this couple's dance instruction series are also helpful.",1209772800,5,730,5.2956521739130435
8077031,5,B000AA7MT2,"Simple, clear, well-presented waltz lessons.  The cost ($10!) is an incredible bargain compared to the multiple private lessons you'd need to learn this material.  Highly recommend.",1166659200,5,181,5.923076923076923
