2196383,5,B0006UEVRC,"Don't listen to the naysayers; some people just don't believe in live and let live. Sure the MTV version is a butchered and mercilessly chopped-up version of the original, but the hip-hop voice acting and soundtrack make it a fun movie for more casual viewers. But for those who want a deeper experience, there's the original, which viewers will find has a more complex plot, expanded editing and larger roles for much of the supporting cast which were greatly marginalized in the MTV version. Now if they could only offer a third alternative: the original cut, with the original script, but dubbed with the hip-hop voice-overs and soundtrack. MTV didn't need to Americanize it so much that they had to remove so many extensive scenes from the original; give some credit to the viewers to be able to enjoy another country's art and culture without worrying that they'll reject it, or worse, defect from the union. For having both versions (and hopefully it's the complete version of the original) this is very much a worthy buy.",1110758400,9,1028,4.846590909090909
2196384,1,B0006UEVRC,"Why can't MTV stick to what it got famous for doing, which was playing music videos and stop creating crappy copies of other great ideas from around the world. This is the biggest rip off of the greatest show ever with again MTV yeilding predictably horrible results. If you want to see the great show that this fiasco was ripped off from, go buy any of the dvds on Amazon.com titled ""Kung Faux"" which can also still be seen as a tv series around the world today. They were the first to re-dub a martial arts film with hip hop stars, but why should that stop a major corporation like MTV from trying to steam roll their way to the front of the line with loads of money and no participation from the originators of the original idea. I hope that the ""Kung Faux"" guys take MTV and the production company ( Distant Corner Horizons) credited for this piece of crap to the cleaners. It makes me sick. Rid the world of bad tv and dvds, and Fight white collar crime in the entertainment industry by boycotting this stinking piece of theivery! You will be glad you didn't waste your money on this. Spend your money on these voice over artists original music cds, the ""original"" untainted Volcano High movie or the ""original"" Kung Faux dvd which have all been out for a couple of years already.

2196387,1,B0006UEVRC,"This new ""hip hop"" version is insulting and just horrible.  I've never been so confused and just lost.  It's not enough that it is a foreign film and that there are some cultural differences but now that is all taken away for a hip hop feel and the tone of the movie is lost.  The new dubbing is too extreme and feels like you're drinking oil and water.  It is also cut up and edited and it is in a lesser audio format.  The original is smart and layered with dark humor but also very entertaining as it is a martial arts film.  It would be better for everyone to find themselves the original Korean import which is longer and in DTS format. which seems to be a normal thing in South Korea unlike here where we are still on the 2.0 stereo wagon.  Do not even give this version a chance.  I had the unfortunate luck of seeing it on an MTV broadcast and I couldn't believe this existed.",1106784000,4,884,4.158823529411765

The voice acting on this is sooo out of place and honestly embarrasing.  I would ask ""what where they thinking"" but judging from the cover art, it is clear. You can practically hear the Viacom execs saying, ""Hey the kids like those rappers and that Wu Fu Clan game is popular! Let's get rappers that can't act do the voices for a Korean fighting movie!

Will this was a while ago, but still not far enough to drown the greatness of this movie in the fail that is MTV. Volcano High is a movie about a high school student with powers beyond his control. Due to them going off when he can't help it, he is tossed around schools like the SAT cheat sheet. He finally finds his way to the last school that will take him and vows to get things straight. From there the movies gets pretty intense, with comedic relief and wonderful actors. The English dubb is my fav, although there's nothing that can distract from the original. Rap and hip hop fans will be glad to know that snoop dogg, method man and others are the English voice cast, and do a terrific job of selling it!

I prefer the Korean sub to the rapper dub, since they didn't seem to get what was really happening.  Too much ad-libbing for my taste.  I had actually lent someone this movie, and never got it back, so I actually have now bought it TWICE!  Still worth it!

1) Locate side A of your DVD which contains the MTV version.

2) Rub vigorously with 60-grit sandpaper until you can no longer see your reflection in that side of the disc.

2196420,3,B0006UEVRC,"I don't know if this is the two-side version or not, but the one I bought at a local store is...

* Side B - Original Korean, with English captioning for the hearing impaired:

This is what I bought the movie for.  I ALMOST DIDN'T because I RESENT MTV making the cover look like it's an American gangster-rapper film, when IT ISN'T.  Anyway, the Korean version is an okay film, but not great.  It's kind of silly.  But it felt like watching a live-action manga, which usually just does not work well.  I'd say it's worth getting if you can get it cheap.

But if you find this movie disappointing, rest assured that there are PLENTY of GREAT Korean films out there.  (Check out the TV dramas, too.)

* Side A - MTV butchering, dubbed with gangster rappers:

I watched this version on a whim one night when I had insomnia.  But I must give praise where due:  MTV did an excellent job of syncronizing the dub.  But that's all they did well.

The soundtrack was re-done with hip-hop.  It just didn't fit.  This is not hip-hop film, neither is it really a gangster film.  And the Korean perception of gangsters is very different from the American, anyway.  (I guess if MTV were to dub ""Hi, Dharma!"" it would carry the tag-line of ""Where Hip Hop and Buddism collide."")

The MTV version has the scenes cut up and out of order.  One example is the plot device of the tea leaves.  In the original version, this was somewhat subtle, and the key scenes were spread throughout the first part of the film.  In the MTV version, these key scenes were all lumped together so that only an idiot could overlook them.  I guess that shows what MTV thinks about the intellegence of its viewers.

There are several scenes with on-screen Korean text.  One is an epilogue, the rest are profiles which are presented when a key character is introduced.  MTV cut most of these, but the few that remain (without being incorporated into the story) stand out really distractingly, probably leaving most viewers wondering, ""What's that?! Why's it there?!""

The English script could have been a lot better.  Simply a different choice of words or even order of lines could have made it better.  ...and the script writer showed his true stupidity when the main character introduces him self as ""Kim Kyeong-Su"" and his teacher imediately referes to him as ""Kim Su,"" inferring that a formal address would be ""Mister Su.""  In Eastern culture, the family name comes first:  This character's family name is Kim, and his ENTIRE ""first name"" is Kyeong-Su.

The speaking of the English dub wasn't all that great.  You think they could have at least COACHED the voice actors on how to pronounce the names.  It was awful every time somebody pronounced Hak-Rim as ""Ha-Kreem"".

It's American imports like this that make me wish Eastern films weren't offically imported, forcing me to forage for a Region 3 DVD.

Oh, bytheway, this was touted as ""An original MTV movie.""",1124150400,,2923,4.638671875

""Kung Faux"" is so real and hilarious and fun to watch that I never get tired of it, but until they release all of their shows on dvd I have to look elswhere to add to my collection.

I love Amazon, but they recommened ""Volcano High"" to me as being a similar title, and man they could not have been farther from the truth...""Volcano High"" flat out sucks!

If you want a funny & fun martial arts movie, I recommend ""Kung Fu Hustle""...It has it's own original style & sense of humor that is different from ""Kung Faux"", but they share a certain sort of realness that is impossible to capture if you are just a ""hack"" trying to scam people like the wankers from ""Volcano High"" did.

""Volcano High"" is such an obvious attempt to rip off ""Kung Faux"", but it fails in every way...it's not funny, it's not entertaining, and it is completely forgettable!

(122 min) the International version(100 min) then the American version (abt 80 min). If you flip the disk over it does contain

Don't buy this HOAX!!!

This movie is not the Original ""Volcano High"" !!!

The original movie is over two hours long! This movie has over a half hour of original footage removed, and to make matters worse they rearranged some of the scenes in a way that makes the story completely incomprehensible.

On top of that they are trying to portray this as some sort of hip hop movie in a direct rip off of ""Kung Faux"", the original hip hop meets martial arts hybrid.

The people behind ""Kung Faux"" have nothing to do with this movie and it is obvious if you are unfortunate enough to watch this hoax.

""Kung Faux"" is fresh funny and entertaining, while this movie is boring, slow, and impossible to follow.

I bought this after seeing an ad for it on TV saying that it starred Tracey Morgan, who I think is hilarious, and I was shocked to find out that he barely says two lines throughtout the whole thing and all of the music they used in the TV ad was not even included in the actual movie.

This thing is a complete rip off and poorly concieved.

My advice is for all of you out there is to either by ""Volcano High"" and other movies like it only if they say they are being distributed by a legitimate source for real Asian films or look for the ""Kung Faux"" logo somewhere on the box if you are into the hip hop meets martial arts hybrid because they do it right.

2196428,4,B0006UEVRC,"For those of us who are over the age of 25, back in the day we would all watch classic kung-fu movies on Saturday morning/afternoon TV.  We remember that those movies were full of action but on the flipside they were also full of the most horrendously done dubbing of English voices that would make you laugh for virtually no reason.  Nowadays we can relive those days thanks to Spike TV and their new ""Films of Fury"" series on Saturday afternoons, but last year MTV (Spike TV's big brother channel) decided to try a little experiment.

The experiment was to take an actual live-action movie and do the exact same thing the old-school movies did, however the film would be more recent (2001) and the dubbers would be those that the new-schoolers could feel (some of the most popular hip-hop artists around)  The end result would be Volcano High, which did originally air on MTV last year and gets an official DVD release this year.

The MTV version, which is a truncated version of the original Korean film (also on the disc)focuses on Kim (voiced by OutKast's Andre 3000), a young man who has a little problem with the fact that he possesses an amazing power but it has gotten him kicked out of 8 schools.  So Kim is sent to his 9th school, the titular school.  Once he arrives he already finds himself hounded by the school bully Jang Yang (voiced by Lil Jon), attracted to a fellow student (voice: Mya) and has a slight run-in with the top student of the school, Hakrim (voice: Snoop Dogg).

When an incident occurs that sends the school's beloved principal to the hospital and Hakrim to jail for attempted  murder, the evil Vice Principal (voice: Pat Morita) begins to take over with extreme discipline and rules that are enforced by a group of the meanest substitute teachers around, led by the stone-faced Mr. Ma (voice: Method Man).  When the students learn that an even more insidious plan is in store for the students, Hakrim reveals to Kim that his powers are the only way the principal and Mr. Ma can be stopped.

The film is a fun little trip back for some and a total head-trip for others but it does feature some unintentionally funny moments (listen carefully and you'll hear Andre 3000 say a rather OutKast-ian variation on a phrase that made me bust a gut the first time I heard it)  It also features something for the old heads that grew up with this type of film and those of us that are more hip to what's hot.  It may not appeal to all but this is one class that you might like to attend...",1112054400,6,2511,4.492307692307692

2196430,5,B0006UEVRC,i bought this movie today and i think tha MTV verson was funny and k but tha orginal was way better do to tha fact that i wasn`t edited...,1111536000,6,138,3.793103448275862
2196431,3,B0006UEVRC,"If you're in the mind for a over-the-top, crazed, charged, genre-bending action-comedy movie, then VOLCANO HIGH is a good choice.  It has great energy and interesting performances from the stars.  The anamorphic picture is quite good and the sounds is very good.  It is really nice to have the original Korean movie, as i find the MTV version nearly unwatchable, but the real annoyance here is that the english subtitles are CC english subtitles, which means there are things like, ""[Thinking]"" or ""[Rumbling]"" that show up in teh subtitles, which are just too irritating.

4 stars for the movie

-1 star for the bad subtitling.",1111536000,9,628,4.942857142857143
2196432,1,B0006UEVRC,"The people giving this piece of crap five stars are either insane or work for MTV or have actually had a hand in making this waste of space and are trying to rip you off to cover their own butts and whomever's money was spent to pull off this fiasco, If you are unfornuate enough to sit through this boring dud, you can tell the  artists don't give a damn about it and probably read their lines, grabbed their check, and hit the road in under ten minutes. Don't needlessly throw away 81 minutes of your life on this and don't be fooled by whomever is planting five stars on this turkey or the use of the artists pictures on the cover because they obviously aren't into it just like you won't be.",1111017600,2,695,4.225563909774436

8043438,2,B0006UEVRC,The resolution is really weird.  It's in a 4:3 format with black bars on the side with the actual movie in the standard wide screen inside the 4:3 with black bars on top.  This gives you black bars on all four sides. Plus the resolution seems very low.  I tried using several different DVD players on windows and on my XBOX One and they all had the same issue.,1518998400,,360,4.188405797101449

Snoop Dogg?

So many people ""borrowed"" this from me and never gave it back, I stopped letting people see it.
