8405584,4,B003U0AHFU,"I had been I fan of the Church in the past and started listening to their material again recently. I didn't even now about this project/collaboration with Steve Kilbey and Martin Kennedy before discovering this.

+The material is nice and mellow and fits Kilbey's voice....he is singing well and seems relaxed in this performance.
+the price of this DVD was very inexpensive ($11.99) so any fans of The Church/Steve Kilbey really should get this since it's even cheaper than the  CD
+he sings a lounge version of ""Under The Milky Way""

-Kilbey is indeed gracious to the audience but I found it tiresome how he would repeatedly say "" Thank you, thank you, thank you very much...you're too kind"" after EVERY SONG. I think because he knew it was being filmed he thought it was a good thing to do, but it was overkill
- parts of the tracks where prerecorded (main drum beats, any synth or piano sounds)

overall though a nice live gig and a showcase of how great Steve Kilbey's voice is.",1372982400,,983,4.6
