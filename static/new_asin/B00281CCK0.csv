D-Lo Brown Vs. Val Venis (WWF European Championship Match) - Overall, a good opener. I liked how Val was putting on D-Lo's chest protector. After the match, Venis hit The Money Shot on the ref. I bet that cost him some money lol.

Kaientai Vs. The Oddites (Handicap Match) - Worst of the entire card.

X-Pac Vs. Jeff Jarrett (Hair Vs. Hair Match) - I liked this match a lot. But the highlight for me was the shaving of Jeff's hair. Not only was X-Pac there, but Droz, Headbangers & even Howard Finkel who was a one night DX member, helped out!

Sable & Edge Vs. Marc Mero & Jacqueline (Mixed Tag Team Match) - I only liked Edge in this match. He was the mysterious enigmatic & tortured soul who came & exited through the crowd which I loved. I loved this version of Edge though they were all great.

Owen Hart Vs. Ken Shamrock (Lion's Den Match) - This took place at the MSG Theater, not where the rest of the card happened. It was a good match. It was hard worked by both men. Not my favorite though.

The New Age Outlaws Vs. Mankind & Kane (No DQ match for the WWF World Tag Team Titles) - Wow. Mankind has some testicular fortitude as he likes to say to compete in a handicap match against a team, hell best on regaining the tag titles. No one knew Kane was in the arena till he showed up after the match.

HHH w/Chyna VS. The Rock w/Mark Henry (WWF Intercontinental Ladder Match) - No doubt, an important match in both men's careers. This was some match. Worth more than one viewing. The DX Band sang HHH to the ring.

""Stone Cold"" Steve Austin Vs. The Undertaker (WWF World Title Match) - I absolutely loved this! One of the best SSlam main events & one of Taker's best matches. Austin said it wasn't one of his best. But as a fan, I think it was. I feel Taker should have won if you consider his effort, keeping his word & the fact that Austin won via low blow before the Stunner. Some moments: Taker ramming Austin's spine against the ring post, the legdrop through the table which didn't break, the Chokeslam from the apron to the middle of the ring. The aftermath was a classic moment for me.

SummerSlam 1999

D-Lo Brown Vs. Jeff Jarrett w/Debra (WWF Intercontinental & European Championship Match) - Debra looked like she was leaving Jeff when he came out with D-Lo. But it was a swerve. In the end, Jeff won thanks to a guitar shot by Mark Henry.

Edge & Christian Vs. The Hardyz Vs. Viscera & Mideon Vs. Darren Drozov & Prince Albert Vs. The Acolytes Vs. Bob & Crash Holly (Tag Team Turmoil Match) - Here, two teams start and every time I think a team's eliminated, another team comes! Edge and Christian kicked it off with The Hardyz. A good start, though short with Edge & Christian winning. They were on some  roll. The got past Viscera & Mideon and Darren Drozov/Albert before losing to the Acolytes, who won to earn a Title shot.

Al Snow Vs. The Big Bossman (Hardcore Title Match) - Didn't like this feud or match.

Ken Shamrock Vs. Steve Blackman (Lion's Den Weapons Match) - Second time a Lion's Den match happened at SSlam. But inlike the first, this time it's with weapons.

Tori Vs. Ivory (WWF Women's Title Match)

Test (RIP Andrew) Vs. Shane McMahon (Greenwich Street Fight) - GREAT!!! GREAT!!! GREAT!!! 1999 - 2001 was Test's highest point of his entire career.

X-Pac & Kane Vs. The Undertaker & The Big Show w/Paul Bearer (WWF World Tag Team Title Match) - Liked this match. Both teams despite not being together long enough to really be thought of a a legit tag team teamed up well. Taker got angry at Show for I guess wasting time. The story here was if X-Pac could survive since he was the smallest of all 4 men. He definitely did till Taker's Tombstone. He had a really good showing though. Taker & Show would have been quite the team just based on their size & since Show was not the ""Big Show"" he is now. But when Taker was letting Big SHow fight his matches while he did commentary lead me to believe something wasn't right & it was a short time later than Taker left WWF. I thought he was done for good.

The Rock Vs. Billy Gunn (Kiss My A** Match) - Decent match. Worth a watch.

Triple H Vs. ""Stone Cold"" Steve Austin Vs. Mankind (WWF World Title Match undert Triple Threat rules) - Jesse Ventura's referring totally made this match for me! All 3 men gave a Championship worthy performance too! Great match!

SummerSlam 2000

Rikishi & 2 Cool Vs. The Right To Censor - This one was a six man tag. Notice one of the first appearances of Victoria (now known as Tara in TNA). Not a bad way to start the show.

X-Pac Vs. ""Road Dogg"" Jesse James - Truly, the battle of DX. But nowhere near as close as HBK vs HHH. But this was still good.

Eddie Guerrero (RIP) & Chyna Vs. Val Venis & Trish Stratus (Mixed Tag Team Match/If Venis or Trish is pinned, either Chyna or Guerrero is the new I-C champion) - Entertaining match. Everytime you see a Guerrero, you're bound to get your money's worth. Especially with Eddie.

Jerry ""The King"" Lawler Vs. Tazz - Didn't like it.

Shane McMahon Vs. Steve Blackmon (WWF Hardcore Title Match) - Wow. For someone who wasn't a full time wrestler, Shane (and his dad too) was really something. Definitely worth a watch or two!

Chris Benoit (RIP) Vs. Chris Jericho (2 out of 3 falls) - I have never saw a bad Jericho/Benoit match. They clicked every time. This was no exception.

Edge & Christian Vs. The Dudley Boyz Vs. The Hardy Boys (TLC Match for the WWF World Tag Team Championship) - WOW! GOOD GOD! ""TABLES, LADDERS & CHAIRS! OH MY!"" MATCH OF THE NIGHT!!!! All you need to know.

The Kat (w/Al Snow) Vs. Terri Runnels (w/Perry Saturn) (Thong Stinkface match)

The Undertaker Vs. Kane - Wasn't a match as a bell was never heard. A great brawl IMO. However, not as good as their matches from 98.

Kurt Angle Vs. Triple H Vs. The Rock (Triple Threat Match for the WWF World Title) - A great main event for a great SSlam.

SummerSlam 2001

Lance Storm (ECW) Vs. Edge(WWF) (WWF Intercontinental Championship Match) - Good opener. I definitely felt like a heel turn was coming shortly. Just didn't know if it was Edge or Christian who'd turn.

Spike Dudley & APA w/Molly Holly (WWF) Vs. Test (Alliance) & The Dudley Boyz (ECW) (Team 3D) - A hard worked tag team match from everyone. Don't skip this.

Tajiri Vs. X-Pac (WCW Cruiserweight & WWF Light Heavyweight Championship Match) - While I didn't enjoy this bout as much as other Crusierweight matches, this was still pretty good.

Rhyno (ECW) w/Stephanie McMahon Vs. Chris Jericho (WWF) - Pretty good grudge match. The Gore Rhyno gave Jericho that went through the SD set is a SD highlight to this day.

Rob Van Damn (ECW) Vs. Jeff Hardy (WWF) (Ladder Match for the WWF Hardcore Championship) - A great Hardcore Title match. Loved it as much as their Invasion match.

The Brothers Of Destruction (Kane & The Undertaker) w/Sara (WWF) Vs. Diamond Dallas Page & Kanyon (WCW) (WCW & WWF World Tag Team Title Match in a cage) - Taker had been waiting to get his hands on DDP & here, he let it all out. Kanyon was lucky to escape eventually. But DDP wasn't so lucky. Taker & Kane did the old school sit up & in something I haven't seen since this event, Taker yells, ""This is for you, baby!"" to his wife at the time & his the ever dangerous Last Ride on Page. Taker & Kane made history by unifying the WWF & WCW Tag Titles. Too bad their reign didn't last long.

""Stone Cold"" Steve Austin (Alliance) Vs. Kurt Angle (WWF) (WWF World Title Match) - This was great feud & a great match. Two veterans who know how to get it done. Can't go wrong with that. Didn't like the screwed up ending. But it did set up the rematch where Kurt angle would win in his hometown so it made sense for him not to win here.

The Rock (WWF) Vs. Booker T. w/Shane McMahon (WCW) (WCW World Title Match) - This was great feud & a great match. Two veterans who know how to get it done. Can't go wrong with that.

SummerSlam 2002

Kurt Angle Vs. Rey Mysterio - Definitely the BEST SSlam opener so far! This was so good, I wish it went longer.

Chris Jericho Vs. ""Nature Boy"" Ric Flair - Jericho should've had a better opponent. But considering Flair's age, can't say this was bad.

Eddie Guerrero (RIP) Vs. Edge - Great match here that was topped however by their Ladder match on SD.

Booker T. & Goldust Vs. The Un-Americans (Lance Storm & Christian)(WWE World Tag Team Championship Match) - One thing to note here. At this point, Smackdown didn't have their version of the Tag Team Titles so there was only one set of belts to fight for. As for the match itself, wasn't bad. Not really a fan however of these kinds of storylines.

Chris Benoit (RIP) Vs. Rob Van Dam (WWE Intercontinental Title Match) - A hidden gem by all means! Great showing by both men. Weird to see RVD without his trademark ponytail.

Test (RIP) Vs. The Undertaker - Good match. For Test, 2002 wasn't 1999 - 2001 (meaning he wasn't as high in 2002 than the other mentioned years). But he had a good showing here. Just wasn't his night. But he did pin Taker via boot to the face in the tag match that happened 2 weeks prior to this event. So you know that I;m talking about, that tag match saw Taker, Rock, Booker T, Goldust against Test, HHH, Lance Storm, Christian.

Shawn Michaels Vs. HHH (Unsanctioned Street Fight) - You have to see this for yourself. Considering how long he took off, it looked like HBK hadn't missed a second of ring time. Dramatic ending too.

The Rock Vs. Brock Lesnar w/Paul Heyman (WWE Undisputed World Title Match) - Brock became ""The Big Thing"" here to many people's opinion. Not mine however even though he won.",1310256000,2,9616,4.381889763779528
3871346,5,B00281CCK0,"Since its inception in 1988, SummerSlam has become one of the premier events on the WWE calendar behind The Royal Rumble, Survivor Series and (of course) WrestleMania. For this review, because they were WWF for many of these events in this set, I will refer to the titles with the WWF tag line. Only SS events when they became WWE will I call them such.

Anyway, let's get to it. I will do it by volumes and I hope you people reading this don't mind if I throw some brief history tibits in too:

SUMMERSLAM, VOL. 3:
In my personal opinion, this volume is the BEST of SummerSlam right here! The weakest SS here is the 1999 edition but even that one is better than much of what we get from Vince and Co. these days! Well, let's start with 1998.

SummerSlam 1998

By this time, the ""Attitude"" era was well underway as both Triple H and The Rock emerged as top draws along with ""Stone Cold"" Steve Austin. The Undertaker was still a top draw and we were getting the first full year of his ""half brother"" Kane. Also, a new crop of stars including Edge, Val Venus and D-Lo Brown emerged to take their share of the spotlight as well.

D-Lo Brown Vs. Val Venis (WWF European Championship Match) - A pretty good opener as both men were in their primes at this point. D-Lo ends up taking this one by DQ when Val Venis refused to put down Brown's ""chest protector."" Ends with Val doing his ""money shot"" splash on the ref because he DQ'ed him.

Kaientai Vs. The Oddites (Handicap Match) - Though Kaientai had the numbers, it didn't matter since you had Golga (the late John Tenta who was also Earthquake), the Kurgan (who stood over 7ft. tall) and Luna Vachon (who was just crazy)! This was basically a glorified squash but not boring as it had some funny spots in it. The Oddities take it.

X-Pac Vs. Jeff Jarrett (Hair Vs. Hair Match) - This was another match that was surprisingly good. Ending is a little cheap but it doesn't take away from the match. Another note is that ring announcer Howard Finkle actually comes to ringside with X-Pac due to an attack by Jarrett prior to this PPV. X-Pac helps Howard get his revenge on Jarrett as he does get his hair cut!

Sable & Edge Vs. Marc Mero & Jacqueline (Mixed Tag Team Match) - This one was also surprisingly good despite Sable's insistance on not taking bumps. Edge was the star here though in hinsight as he performed very well for his first big PPV outing for the then-WWF. Sable and Edge had good chemistry as they finished off Mero for the victory.

Owen Hart Vs. Ken Shamrock (Lion's Den Match) - In this one, the two men fight in a cage similiar to the UFC octagon ring. Also, this is a revenge bout for Shamrock as he ""lost"" a ""Dungeon"" match to Owen a month earlier. These two made the most of this match as they mixed the MMA style with pro wrestling. Ends when Shamrock locks in his anklelock and Dan ""The Beast"" Severn (who was Owen's second) refused to throw the towel in for him! Owen had to tap out on his own. Great match!

The New Age Outlaws Vs. Mankind & Kane (No DQ match for the WWF World Tag Team Titles) - This ended up being a 2 on 1 because Kane no-showed on his partner. To his credit, Foley held his own but was no match for ""Bada**"" Billy Gunn and ""Road Dogg"" Jesse James. Needless to say, after taking a brutal beating, NAO regain the belts.

HHH w/Chyna VS. The Rock w/Mark Henry (WWF Intercontinental Ladder Match) - A pivitol match in both men's careers as they gave (arguably) the best bout of the night, certainly the most memorable. Both men took their share of shots and bumps in this one despite it being mostly a ground match. Ends when The Rock nearly get his I-C strap back but Chyna throws a straight right hand to The Rock's ""manhood"" to prevent the win! HHH then climbs the ladder and gets his second I-C title. Also available on&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/WWE-The-Ladder-Match/dp/B000LC3IJ2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">WWE - The Ladder Match</a>.

""Stone Cold"" Steve Austin Vs. The Undertaker (WWF World Title Match) - Austin has said on many occassions that this wasn't one of his best bouts due to an early knockout in the match by The Undertaker when 'Taker quickly shot up after a kick from a backdrop. The top of UT's head actually butted the chin of Austin, knocking him down! Still, it was a good main event with the high spot being UT jumping off the top rope and onto Austin while he laid on a table on the outside! Ends when Austin got the ""Stone Cold"" stunner after a low blow on 'Taker.
Overall, this was a strong card.

SummerSlam 1999

The ""Attitude"" era was still in full swing at this point. HHH was now a contender for the WWF World Title while Austin was still champion. The Rock became a huge fan favorite was a new career was starting to emerge but would be slowed down by politics. I am speaking of the late Andrew Martin, better known as Test. Anyway, let's get to it.

D-Lo Brown Vs. Jeff Jarrett w/Debra (WWF Intercontinental & European Championship Match) - Jeff Jarrett was looking to become only the second man to hold both the I-C and European titles at the same time as he previously lost the Intercontinental strap in a previous match to D-Lo. Great contest that ended with a swerve as Mark Henry double crossed Brown by hitting him with a guitar from Jarrett! Jeff wins this one.

Edge & Christian Vs. The Hardyz Vs. Viscera & Mideon Vs. Darren Drozov & Prince Albert Vs. The Acolytes Vs. Bob & Crash Holly (Tag Team Turmoil Match) - Basically, this match works similiar to the Royal Rumble. Two teams start and every time there is a decision, another team joins in! Edge and Christian along with The Hardyz had the unenviable task of starting first! They put on a short but good contest with E & C winning. They were on a roll as they went through Viscera & Mideon and Darren Drozov/Albert before falling to the future APA! Farooq and Bradshaw would go on to win the event and earn a WWF Tag Team Title match down the road.

Al Snow Vs. The Big Bossman (Hardcore Title Match) - Not a horrible match but not a good one either. Snow wins after The Road Dogg Jesse James interferes in the match.
Ken Shamrock Vs. Steve Blackmon (Lion's Den Weapons Match) - This one played into both guys' backgrounds. Not a high flying classic by no means, just a straight butt-whippin' match! Ends when Shamrock knocks Blackmon out with a kendo stick and the referee counts him out!

Tori Vs. Ivory (WWF Women's Title Match) - Worst bout on the card! I am generally willing to give women's matches a chance but this one was terrible! Watch it once to see how bad it was and skip upon repeated viewings!

Test (RIP) Vs. Shane McMahon (Greenwich Street Fight) - The best match on the card without question! For such a big man (he stood about 6'7"" and weighed at least 290lbs.), Test could move and actually could go to the air! Shane has always impressed me by his ring acumen for someone that isn't a regular performer. This bout was crazy as it had the right mix of brutality, wrestling, outside interference for both guys and just drama. Ends when Test does his flying elbowsmash (a la Randy Savage) for the win and the right to date Stephanie McMahon.

Sadly, other than a good run in 2001, this would be the best we would see of Test as (in my view), he would never get as high as he did here! RIP Andrew!

X-Pac & Kane Vs. The Undertaker & The Big Show w/Paul Bearer (WWF World Tag Team Title Match) - Decent match that centered around could X-Pac survive this contest. A valid point considering that The Big Show was 7'3"" and weighed over 450lbs. at this point while his partner UT was 6'9"" tall, weighs at 320lbs. and he was the SMALL man of the duo! LOL!

Ends when X-Pac survived TBS's chokeslam but not UT's tombstone! This huge duo walked out with the WWF World Tag Team Titles.

The Rock Vs. Billy Gunn (Kiss My A** Match) - In this one, BG stated that if The Rock lost, he would not be kissing his behind BUT rather this designated woman (who looked to be about 250lbs.)! Decent contest that saw BG kiss this woman's behind before getting pinned by The Rock!

Triple H Vs. ""Stone Cold"" Steve Austin Vs. Mankind (WWF World Title Match undert Triple Threat rules) - The behind the scenes story was probably as good as the match itself as rumor has it that Austin didn't want to job to HHH because he felt he wasn't ready for the World title. Austin did agree to drop the title to Foley however. Interesting since Austin has accussed HHH of doing the same thing when he once did to him.

As for the match itself, it was pretty good. Guest referee Jesse ""The Body"" Ventura made things interesting as well. Ends with Foley hitting his chickenwing DDT for the victory. HHH would still go on to win the WWF title the next night on RAW. Meanwhile, Austin would take time off shortly after this bout for spinal surgery and would be gone for nearly a year.

As I said, this one is the weakest of the SS cards on this volume but even this one is better than most of the stuff we get from the WWF/WWE these days!

SummerSlam 2000

Rikishi & 2 Cool Vs. The Right To Censor - This one was a six man tag team bout that saw one of the first appearances of Victoria (now known as Tara in TNA). The RTC (who was Stevie Richards, The Goodfather & Bull Buchanan) was basically a spoof of PTC (Parents Television Council) which all but tried to get WWF/WWE banned during that time! As we know, it didn't work! LOL! Anyway, this one wasn't a bad opener as it saw the RTC pick up the win!

X-Pac Vs. ""Road Dogg"" Jesse James - While this was a battle of DX, DON'T expect Shawn Michaels Vs. Triple H of two years later at this event. NOT EVEN CLOSE! Still, these two guys should've gotten more time than they did considering the history. Good match but not a classic by any means.

Eddie Guerrero (RIP) & Chyna Vs. Val Venis & Trish Stratus (Mixed Tag Team Match/If Venis or Trish is pinned, either Chyna or Guerrero is the new I-C champion) - This match was very fun and entertaining. Just to put things into context though, don't expect the Trish we came to know between 2002-2006. She was very NEW at this time and had little experience. In fact, most of this match was worked by Val and Eddie. Chyna, at this point, was a very competent grappler that could work with men or women. Trish, as stated earlier, had limited experience and was regulated to comedy in this one.

Ends when Chyna gets her hands on Trish and pins her for the win and for her second I-C title (she held it once before previously).

Jerry ""The King"" Lawler Vs. Tazz - Let me say that I enjoy Jerry ""The King"" Lawler's ring work and comedy but that being said, NO WAY SHOULD HE HAVE BEAT TAZZ! That would be like me (35yrs. old at this time with no ring experience) whipping Ric Flair in his prime! The ending is what makes it interesting as Jim Ross (who was attacked by Tazz before this PPV) got his payback and helped Lawler win the contest.

Shane McMahon Vs. Steve Blackmon (WWF Hardcore Title Match) - The match itself wasn't that special as it was basically Blackmon dominating Shane until Test and Albert show up to interfere. What is most remembered about this one is the 70+ fall that Shane took from the top of the Titan-tron! The man had b***s, I'll give him that! Ends when Blackmon took his own leap onto Shane for the pin.

Chris Benoit (RIP) Vs. Chris Jericho (2 out of 3 falls) - This match isn't their best encounter though I defy you to find a Benoit/Jericho match that sucked! Still, it gave what you would expect and that's hard, stiff and brutal technical wrestling. It went all three falls with Benoit getting the win after reversing a rollup and some leverage from the ropes, a rare Benoit cheat move.

Edge & Christian Vs. The Dudley Boyz Vs. The Hardy Boys (TLC Match for the WWF World Tag Team Championship) - My favorite of all the TLC's (though TLC III comes close)! This one was probably the fastest paced of all the ones I've seen! These three teams got busy in this one! The turning point was when Lita jumped in for The Hardys and nearly cost Edge and Christian the match! In the end, E & C survived and retained their Tag Team Gold. Also available on&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/WWE-The-Ladder-Match/dp/B000LC3IJ2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">WWE - The Ladder Match</a>&nbsp;.

The Kat (w/Al Snow) Vs. Terri Runnels (w/Perry Saturn) (Thong Stinkface match) - Can't defend this bout whatsoever! This was about seeing two hot women in bikini's and thongs try to give the other a stinkface! Nothing much to see here. Oh, The Kat won by the way.

The Undertaker Vs. Kane - This was a straight up brawl. Not bad but I've seen better from these two. Undertaker wins by default when Kane runs from the ring after being unmasked.

Kurt Angle Vs. Triple H Vs. The Rock (Triple Threat Match for the WWF World Title) - In this one, the storyline was as big as the match if not bigger! Also, watch the beginning to see HHH botch a Pedigree onto a table, giving Angle a real concussion and putting him out for most of the contest! Basically, it was The Rock Vs. HHH with twists thrown in here and there. Ends when HHH accidentally slugs Stephanie McMahon, allowing Angle to get the sledgehammer and clock him! Before he could get the three count, The Rock gets rid of Angle and takes the pin on HHH after a ""people's elbow."" Wild match to say the least.

This one is my 2nd favorite SummerSlam of all time. Read on to see what my favorite one is!

SummerSlam 2001
By this time, both the original ECW and WCW had folded and many of their stars had come to WWE (still WWF at this point). What could've been a glorious angle ended up being lackluster at best. Still, it had its moments. Every match except for the Cruiserweight/Light Heavyweight title match was WWF Vs. The Alliance (a mix of WCW & ECW talent with ""Stone Cold"" Steve Austin & Test thrown into the group). Let's get to this edition of SummerSlam.

Lance Storm (ECW) Vs. Edge(WWF) (WWF Intercontinental Championship Match) - SummerSlam seems to have the best openers of all the WWE/WWF cards and this one was no exception. Storm was coming off of both a successful stint in the original ECW and in WCW when he won the I-C strap. Edge was now starting to get a singles push and you do see signs of his tag team with Christian coming to an end here (see The Ladder Match DVD set for the full story there). As for this match, it was pretty good and it saw Edge (despite a backfired attempt at interference by Christian on Edge's behalf) win his second I-C title (he won it briefly in 1999 from Jeff Jarrett as well).

Spike Dudley & APA w/Molly Holly (WWF) Vs. Test (Alliance) & The Dudley Boyz (ECW) (Team 3D) - Hard hitting six man tag and continues the tradition of six man excellence at SummerSlam! I forgot how this one actually ends but I know that Test and The Dudleys take this one.

Tajiri Vs. X-Pac (WCW Cruiserweight & WWF Light Heavyweight Championship Match) - In this one, both men came in with belts but only one would walk away with both titles. A pretty good contest that ends with X-Pac unifying both titles. Guy is a jerk but can wrestle when he wants.

Rhyno (ECW) w/Stephanie McMahon Vs. Chris Jericho (WWF) - This was a grudge match and a pretty good one. Rhyno was (and still is) a competent grappler who can definitely follow the lead of someone like Jericho. The added backstory of Jericho's continued taunts about Stephanie McMahon (which had been going on long before this angle) was also a part of this match. Ends when Jericho makes Rhyno submit to his ""Walls Of Jericho"" boston crab for the victory!

Rob Van Damn (ECW) Vs. Jeff Hardy (WWF) (Ladder Match for the WWF Hardcore Championship) - This was a good match but if you really want to see a good RVD Vs. Jeff Hardy bout, find WWF Invasion 2001 as that match (in my view) was way better! That being said, this was more about actual athleticism than hardcore gore and guts as both men put on a show. Interesting enough, though a heel, RVD got as many cheers as Jeff Hardy! Also available on&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/WWE-Jeff-Hardy-My-Life-My-Rules/dp/B002NXSROS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">WWE: Jeff Hardy - My Life, My Rules</a>.

Ends with RVD regaining his Hardcore title from Hardy.

The Brothers Of Destruction (Kane & The Undertaker) w/Sara (WWF) Vs. Diamond Dallas Page & Kanyon (WCW) (WCW & WWF World Tag Team Title Match in a cage) - This one had to be the most one-sided a**-kickin' I've ever seen! I don't care if it is scripted, DDP and Kanyon got murdered here! With 'Taker's then-wife Sara looking on, UT along with Kane got revenge for her and in the process became the 1st team to hold both the WCW and WWF World Tag Team Titles at the same time! Not a bad match if you are a fan of either 'Taker or Kane but not a great match! Too one sided but watch just to see how bad the tail-kickin' was!

""Stone Cold"" Steve Austin (Alliance) Vs. Kurt Angle (WWF) (WWF World Title Match) - With due respect to the official main event of The Rock and Booker T. (both of whom I love and are big fans of), this match was the REAL MAIN EVENT of SummerSlam. It was interesting to see Austin as the heel while Angle was the face as it was usually the other way around when these two met. This match was very well done and even the screwjob ending didn't hurt either guy. I would dare call this one the best match Austin/Angle ever did together. Great match!

The Rock (WWF) Vs. Booker T. w/Shane McMahon (WCW) (WCW World Title Match) - Like I said previously, this one went last but I felt the WWF title match was better! That being said, this one wasn't a bad bout as Booker T. was angled almost to be WCW's version of The Rock while it was still in business. I liken this feud to Joe Fraizer Vs. Muhammad Ali with Booker playing the Fraizer role while the Ali role was done by The Rock. Also available on&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Rock-The-Most-Electrifying-Man-in-Sports-Entertainment/dp/B00120LPQ0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Rock: The Most Electrifying Man in Sports Entertainment</a>.

Overall, a pretty good matchup but we never really got to see the feud that could've been good between these two. Still, at least we got to see one dream match out of this whole angle! LOL!

This was a good card. Not a great SummerSlam but definitely one of the better ones.

SummerSlam 2002
I am going ahead and saying it......THIS WAS THE BEST SUMMERSLAM TO DATE (including 2008 & 2009 which are not a part of this review)! There was only two slow matches and even those are better than what we are getting from WWE these days! Let's get to this one!

Kurt Angle Vs. Rey Mysterio - Best SummerSlam opener to date! The crowd was into this match from start to finish. I don't think there was a really slow spot in the entire thing. Ends when Angle blocks a hurracanrana attempt by Rey and puts him into the anklelock for the tap out! Still, not a bad WWE PPV debut for Rey Mysterio!

Chris Jericho Vs. ""Nature Boy"" Ric Flair - This was a good match between these two. Flair, I think, was in his 50's when this match took place and he still worked better than a lot of guys back then or even now! As for Jericho, what can be said as he can work with nearly anyone. Both of these two pulled out their bad of tricks both legal and illegal but Flair came out on top using his figure-four leglock which was preceeded by a lowblow!

Eddie Guerrero (RIP) Vs. Edge - The first of a trilogy between these two as it would continued to WWE Unforgiven 2002 with the final match taking place on Smackdown (see Viva La Raza: The Legacy Of Eddie Guerrero for that match). Overall, the main story was Eddie working over Edge's left arm including a sick looking Frog Splash onto the arm! Ouch! Edge gutted it out and gain the victory however. Great match!

Booker T. & Goldust Vs. The Un-Americans (Lance Storm & Christian)(WWE World Tag Team Championship Match) - At this point, Smackdown had not yet created their version of the WWE World Tag Team Championship so there was only one set of belts to fight for. As for the match itself, it had its bad points but it wasn't bad. Ends when Test (who was also a member of the Un-Americans) interfered and knocked Booker T. out with his vicious boot to the face! Storm and Christian retain the titles.

Chris Benoit (RIP) Vs. Rob Van Dam (WWE Intercontinental Title Match) - This one is definitely a ""lost classic"" even before the actions of Chris Benoit caused many of his bouts to be blacklisted! This one should've been on&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/WWE-Hard-Knocks-The-Chris-Benoit-Story/dp/B00028G6TO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">WWE - Hard Knocks - The Chris Benoit Story</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/WWE-Rob-Van-Dam-One-of-a-Kind/dp/B0006SSNVY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">WWE - Rob Van Dam - One of a Kind</a>.

As for the match itself, it showed the wide range of skills of Benoit while showing the heart of RVD as Chris pretty much kicked his behind for most of the match! Stiff wrestling at its best as both men took some hard shots. Ends when RVD nails his ""Five Star"" frog splash after taking a vicious beating from Chris (including getting caught in the crossface at least 3 different times in the bout).

Test (RIP) Vs. The Undertaker - This match takes it on the chin but I thought it wasn't bad at all. I've seen worse big man matches and would gladly watch the late Andrew Martin Vs. UT over (say) UT Vs. The Great Khali anytime! LOL!

Anyway, it has some twists and turns but ends when UT uses his tombstone piledriver to put away Test! At the end, a shot that has become iconic with 'Taker as he takes an American flag from a fan in the audience and holds it up in the ring.

Shawn Michaels Vs. HHH (Unsanctioned Street Fight) - Unbelivably, this was Shawn's first match back in over 4 years. I say that because you'd never know that he had been gone that long by the way he wrestled! On the Shawn Michaels: Heartbreak & Triumph DVD, HHH admits that even as good as he is, he couldn't take off 4 years and come back that good! This match has to be seen to be believed! Even the ending can't take away how good it was!

The Rock Vs. Brock Lesnar w/Paul Heyman (WWE Undisputed World Title Match) - Now, let me say that I love The Rock dearly but I have to also say he got his a** handed to him here! Even without the interference of Heyman (which was minimal), Brock pretty much dominated this match except for a few segments. Ends when he catches The Rock in an F-5 after ""The Great One"" reversed an earlier attempt at it.

Overall, to date, this one is the greatest SummerSlam EVER! And this is the best volume of this anthology set (in my view)!",1266278400,3,23335,4.606600819079739

All of the pay-per-views themselves are fantastic, but the ones that really stand out are the 1998,2000,and 2002 editions. The 1999 and 2001 editions are still good, but they do have some matches that were below average. I definitely recommend this set to fans that are tired of the WWE product today and want to relieve the attitude era, and people that have never witnessed these events. It will make you think what happened to the WWE since the attitude era.",1250467200,3,804,4.402684563758389
3871348,5,B00281CCK0,"Volume 3 of the ""WWE SummerSlam Anthology"" is easily the best of the bunch.  Not only is it the most well-rounded package, but the five PPVs included are among the best of the entire ""SummerSlam"" Anthology, from 1988 all the way to 2008.  The least of the events (the 2000 edition, IMO) is still a good card.

If you want the short version, skip to the end.
If you're in for a long version, let's get to it!

*****1998*****
Our first PPV of Volume 3 is a good one.  The 1998 ""SummerSlam"" includes a handful of solid matches, while the rest is at least watchable.  The show's two main events are among the best from the Attitude Era.  The Rock and Triple H probably stole the show with their Ladder Match for the Intercontinental Title.  Even today, this decade-old fight holds us incredibly well.  The main event pitted The Undertaker against `Stone Cold' Steve Austin for the WWF Championship.  In my opinion, this is the best match Taker & Austin had with each other.  It's a wild frenzied brawl that shows how talented both men were, especially considering they had to follow a Ladder Match that had the crowd exhausted.

The rest of the card is pretty good.  The opener features Val Venis challenging D'Lo Brown for the European Title, probably the first notable PPV appearance from either man.  X-Pac and Jeff Jarrett had a solid Hair-vs-Hair contest, in which Howard Finkel had a minor role after Double J cut his hair days before the PPV.

Sable and Marc Mero continued their feud, with both picking a partner in mixed tag team action.  The highlight is Sable revealing Edge to be the mystery partner, and both men worked well together, as did the ladies.  Owen Hart and Ken Shamrock competed in a Lions Den Match, which is basically an octagonal cage similar to most MMA arenas.  It was a unique and acceptable addition to the 1998 ""SummerSlam"".

I was disappointed that because of the storyline, Mankind was forced to defend the WWF Tag Team Titles against The New Age Outlaws in a No Disqualifications Match, because Kane no-showed the event.  While it was commendable seeing the three men beat the crap out of each other, I would've rather seen Kane get involved in the match rather than just showing up at the end.

Volume 3 of the ""SummerSlam"" Antology is off to a good start, so be sure to check this 1998 event out.
______________________________________________

*****1999*****
The annual August event continues its streak of good PPVs with the 1999 edition.

Jesse ""The Body"" Ventura makes a guest appearance as the referee for the main event.  The jist is that Ventura wouldn't show favoritism to any one of the wrestlers, and he wouldn't put up with any suspicious activity.  Triple H and Mankind competed in a Triple Threat Match against ""Stone Cold"" Steve Austin for his WWF Championship, and it's one of the best PPV 3-way matches that I've seen.  In addition to the quality of the action, I think many were surprised by who won the match.

My favorite match on the card is the Greenwich Street Fight, in which Test had to defeat Shane McMahon in order to be Stephanie McMahon's boyfriend.  Keep in mind that this was pre-HHH/Steph.  Without a doubt, this is my favorite match from Andrew ""Test"" Martin's career, and it's easily one of Shane's best.  The violence is just excruciating to watch, and it's great fun when The Mean Street Posse gets involved.

There are some other good matches.  D'Lo Brown puts both the Intercontinental and European Title on the line against Jeff Jarrett in the solid opener.  The Tag Team Turmoil gauntlet is a good display of 6 teams, mainly how The Hardy Boyz and Edge/Christian got to show off their skills before their legendary Ladder Matches in the months to come.  Perhaps the biggest surprise is how strong the Tag Team Titles Match is, as Undertaker & Big Show challenge Kane & X-Pac for the straps.  Trust me, it's quite the enjoyable contest.

This card hits a rough hour around the 40-minute mark.  Road Dogg & Chris Jericho confront each other with a pointless promo, followed by a poor Hardcore Title Match, an abysmal Women's Title Match, and a confusing Weapons Lions Den Match.  Also, I think the Kiss-My-A$$ Match between Billy Gunn & The Rock is a total letdown, considering how much I enjoy both of their skills.

""SummerSlam `99"" is another good card to spend 3 hours with.  Although not as solid as the 1998 edition before it, it's enough of a success to warrant at least one viewing.
______________________________________________

*****2000*****
Although this may be the weakest of the bunch, ""SummerSlam 2000"" still has a handful of quality contests.  My favorite match from 2000 and my favorite Ladder Match of all time would be the TLC Match between Edge & Christian (Tag Team champions), The Dudley Boyz, and The Hardy Boyz.  Even though this modern showstopper is on the WWE's ""Ladder Match"" 3-disc set, and soon to be on the WWE's ""Allied Powers"" Tag Team collection, I figure you're stuck with this event anyway.  Might as well enjoy it, right?

Another exceptional bout has Chris Jericho and Chris Benoit continue their on-and-off rivalry in a Two-Out-Of-Three Falls Match.  I prefer some of their other WWF encounters from this same time period, but this one hasn't been released on any other WWE DVD yet.  You'd be wise to give this solid technical display a watch.

The two marquee matches from ""SummerSlam 2000"" is where this one may fall flat for most people.  The Undertaker and Kane turned their grudge match into nothing but a punch-kick-punch-kick brawl with a bogus finish.  In short, it's easily the worst Taker/Kane encounter I've ever seen.  And the main event almost became a disaster after Kurt Angle suffered a concussion early on, forcing the WWF Championship Triple Threat to just let The Rock and Triple H battle it out by themselves for almost the entire match.  Unfortunately, Rock & HHH had squared off so many times in 2000 that the crowd wasn't into this one a whole lot.  I personally thought Angle's concussion allowed for a neat finish, but some might not get into it.

The undercard is mostly forgettable.  Road Dogg & X-Pac permanently end D-Generation X in their grudge match, which was a long time coming.  The Hardcore Title Match is mostly famous for Steve Blackman knocking Shane McMahon for his very first TitanTron fall.  It's still a horrifying moment, but the match is average.  One amtch I particularly liked was Val Venis putting his Intercontinental Title on the line in a Tag Team Match, where he partned with Tirsh Stratus against Eddie Guerrero & Chyna.  Even though Guerrero & Venis do most of the work, I thought the ladies did their parts well.

Overall, I think ""SummerSlam 2000"" achieves a passing grade, but only marginally so.  If it weren't for the exhilarating TLC Match, this PPV would've been a decent-but-forgettable affair.
______________________________________________

*****2001*****
I really only have one big problem with this single DVD.  It's very likely that a lot of ""WW_"" moments are gonna happen.  The Fed wasn't the WW'E' yet, and the whole Invasion angle where WCW/ECW tried to take over the WWF was taking place.  As a result, there may be some more audio editing than usual.

But other than that, this is another excellent PPV from start to finish.  Every match delivers, except for a few that don't meet their full potential.

Tonight's main event featured The Rock returning to the WWF to challenge Booker T for his WCW Championship.  The other main event showcased Kurt Angle in his first babyface run, trying to win the WWF Championship from WCW/ECW Alliance leader `Stone Cold' Steve Austin.  Aside from Booker being made to look more foolish than in his WCW career, Rock & Booker had a good match to satisfyingly close the show.  Austin and Angle, on the other hand, had an outstanding match.  I usually hate title matches on PPV that end in disqualifications, but this time it made perfect sense.  And Angle was rapidly becoming one of the most respected in the company only after two years.  Definitely check this match out!

Perhaps the next best matches are the first two on the PPV: Edge challenging Lance Storm to bring the WWF Intercontinental Title back home, and a fast-paced fun 6-Man Tag Team match between the two factions.  The Title-For-Title bout between X-Pac (WWF Light-Heavyweight champion) and Tajiri (WCW Cruiserweight champion) is also a good time, with a good dose of aerial spots.

""SummerSlam 2001"" also has three matches that get the job done, but aren't nearly as good as they should've been.  Most surprising is how a Ladder Match between Jeff Hardy and Rob Van Dam didn't reach the heights (forgive the pun) that their ""Invasion"" classic did, mostly due to some botched spots.  In another grudge match, Chris Jericho and Rhyno also didn't quite click as well as you'd expect from athletes of their caliber.  And the other Titles-For-Titles Match --- this one in a Steel Cage --- was basically Undertaker & Kane beating the tar out of DDP & Kanyon to win both the WWF and WCW Tag Team Championships.  Again, these three matches are fine, but could've been much better.

But don't let that last paragraph worry you, because ""SummerSlam 2001"" is an exceptional event.  2001 was a very strong year for the WWF, and ""SummerSlam"" is among its finest moments.
______________________________________________

*****2002*****
What a great way to finish a five-disc set.  My personal favorite of the ""SummerSlam"" cards is this 2002 edition.  Even though two of its best matches are on other WWE DVDs, the entire card is watchable.  The forgettable decent matches include Ric Flair versus Chris Jericho, Eddie Guerrero versus Edge, and a by-the-numbers Tag Team Titles Match (Christian & Lance Storm v. Booker T & Goldust).  There's a solid ""big man"" contest between Test and recently-turned-babyface Undertaker.

But the best parts of this 2002 ""SummerSlam"" are four excellent matches, scattered throughout the card.  The two that are available on other WWE DVDs are the opener between Kurt Angle and Rey Mysterio, and the Unsanctioned Street Fight between Triple H and Shawn Michaels, who competed in his first TV match in over 4 years.  Both of these great matches are complemented by a strong technical match between Rob Van Dam (""RAW"") and Chris Benoit (Intercontinental champion from ""SmackDown"") in an interpromotional contest.

The main event is what Michael Cole called, ""The most anticipated event in `SummerSlam' history.""  At the time, he wasn't kidding.  Brock Lesnar challenged The Rock for the Undisputed WWE Championship, and it's a damn shame we never got to see these two athletes mix it up again.  But that only makes this modern classic more memorable.  WWE hyped this one like crazy, and the charismatic Rock and physical specimen Brock Lesnar delivered big time.  Most will say that HHH/HBK was the better match, but I prefer this main event by a slim margin.

If you can't get your hands on the WWE's original ""SummerSlam 2002"" DVD (it has some solid extras), then this is the only reason you need to buy this 5-disc set.
______________________________________________

Let's recap:
The 1998 event is a strong example of why most fans love the Attitude Era, with even the worst matches being worth your time.

The 1999 event is another good event from this 5-disc set, even though it hits a boring patch between the 0:40-1:40 time period.

My least favorite is the 2000 PPV, but it's still got some good matches on it to warrant at least one viewing.  It's best match (The TLC Match) has been released on a few other WWE DVDs, but who cares, right?

Other than some ""WWF"" dubbing, the 2001 ""SummerSlam"" is sure to please most viewers.  The influx of WCW & ECW talent into the WWF was a great treat for wrestling fans, and in a year full of high spots, this August 2001 event is among the best.

The 2002 ""SummerSlam"" is hands down, my favorite of the entire 21-event Anthology.  Its best matches are scattered throughout the card, and its weakest matches are still a fun time.

Even though you're missing out on some nice DVD Extras from the 1999-2002 releases, the PPVs are well worth your time.  This is a strong 5-disc package.  If you're a collector, then go ahead and try to hunt down the original WWF/WWE discs.  But if you just want the PPVs, then buy this immediately!",1242172800,11,12380,4.823920265780731
3871349,5,B00281CCK0,"This is the third volume of the SummerSlam Anthology that was already released. These were the periods where the ""Attitude"" era was in full force.

1998 - SummerSlam returns to Madison Square Garden on the final stop of the ""Highway To Hell"" highlighted by the WWE Championship match between Steve Austin vs. Undertaker.  The other top match on this card were the leaders of both The Nation & D-Generation X going at it in a ladder match for the Intercontinental Championship as Triple H went against The Rock.  Other matches include Edge making his WWE PPV debut teaming with Sable vs. Marc Mero & Jacqueline, X-Pac vs. Jeff Jarrett in a hair match, D'Lo Brown defending the European Title vs. Val Venis, Ken Shamrock vs. Owen Hart in a Lion's Den match, Mankind defending the Tag Team Champions alone vs. New Age Outlaws, and the Oddities vs. Kaientai with a performance from Insane Clown Posse.  This is one of those classic SummerSlam's that provided everything & was a hot card from top to bottom here.

1999 - The highlight of this SummerSlam was the return to WWE after 9 years (and a bunch of controversy between him & the company in that time) of the then-Gov. of Minnesota in Jesse ""The Body"" Ventura to referee the main event...which for those trivia fans is actually the second time he's done that.  Steve Austin defended the WWE Championship in a triple threat match against Triple H and the returning Mankind, The Rock met Mr. Ass (Billy Gunn) in a ""Kiss My Ass"" match, X-Pac & Kane defended the Tag Team Championship against the Undertaker & Big Show, Womens Champion Ivory vs. Tori, Al Snow met Hardcore Champion Big Boss Man in a match that ended up in a bar across the street, Ken Shamrock's last WWE PPV vs. Steve Blackman in a Lion's Den weapons match, a tag team gauntlet featuring the Acolytes & Edge/Christian & Hardy Boyz, D'Lo Brown defending both his Intercontinental & European Championships against Jeff Jarrett, and what many concider the highlight of this event in Shane McMahon vs. Test in a street fight complete with cameos from the Mean Street Posse & ""the Stooges"" Patterson & Brisco.

2000 - This SummerSlam was highlighted by the main event of The Rock defending the WWE Championship against Triple H & Kurt Angle that featured a prematch brawl that included a pedigree through a table that was so memorable (and botched) that it was used on the ""Don't Try This At Home"" commercial for years afterwards.  This event also marked the debut of a WWE staple over the years in the T.L.C. match as Edge & Christian defended their Tag Team Titles against the Dudleys & the homecoming team of the Hardy Boyz.  Other matches include Undertaker vs. Kane, Hardcore Champion Shane McMahon vs. Steve Blackman with Shane taking a fall that you have to see to believe, Intercontinental Champion Val Venis defending his title in a mixed tag match with Trish Stratus vs. Eddie Guerrero & Chyna, a 2 out of 3 falls match between Chris Jericho & Chris Benoit, Jerry Lawler vs. Tazz, the Right To Censor vs. Rikishi & Too Cool with future WWE Womens Champion Victoria making her PPV debut here as one of the Godfather's ex-ladies, and a thong stinkface match between The Kat & Terri.

2001 - The WWE vs. WCW/ECW Invasion war continued here as for the first time, two World Championships were on the line here.  The Rock made his PPV return here against WCW Champion Booker T while WWE Champion Steve Austin wrestled a classic match against Kurt Angle.  Also on the card were two sets of ""champion vs. champion"" matches with WCW Tag Team Champions Undertaker & Kane vs. WWE Tag Team Champions DDP & Kanyon in a steel cage match while WCW Crusierweight Champion X-Pac went against WWE Light Heavyweight Champion Tajiri.  Other matches include Hardcore Champion Jeff Hardy vs. Rob Van Dam in a ladder match, Chris Jericho vs. Rhyno, Dudley Boyz & Test vs. A.P.A. & Spike Dudley, Edge goes for the Intercontinental Title against Lance Storm in what Storm has called the best match in his WWE career.

2002 - In many people's minds, this has been concidered the last classic SummerSlam as the two main events here featured the elevation/birth of a new star while a icon from the past returned to the ring with The Rock defending the WWE Undisputed Championship vs. Brock Lesnar while Shawn Michaels returned to a WWE ring for the first time since WrestleMania XIV in an unsanctioned Street Fight against Triple H.  This PPV also had a stacked undercard as well with a RAW vs. SmackDown match for the Intercontinental Championship with RVD vs. Chris Benoit in a ""lost classic"", Edge vs. Eddie Guerrero, Ric Flair vs. Chris Jericho, Kurt Angle vs. Rey Mysterio, Tag Team Champions Lance Storm & Christian vs. Booker T & Goldust, and Undertaker vs. Test.

Out of all four SummerSlam volumes, this is the best one to get as every event here was a quality event that you would expect from it being one of WWE's top PPV's of the year & quite frankly, this is the climax/peek of this anthology when it comes to the quality of the events.",1241827200,5,5042,4.673814898419865
