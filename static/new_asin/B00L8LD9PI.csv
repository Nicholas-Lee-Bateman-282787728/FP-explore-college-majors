6474342,5,B00L8LD9PI,"Honestly, the best comedy out there, but watch for adult themes -- definitely not for kids.  I sincerely hope there's a season four being made!",1412553600,2,143,4.72

6474344,5,B00L8LD9PI,"Burning Love (all of them) has been my laughter therapy for the last three months.... Thank you for the spot on parody of how twisted our culture has become around ""falling in love"" and weddings, monogamy and getting married. You guys nailed it.",1431734400,2,245,4.72093023255814
6474345,5,B00L8LD9PI,"If you like the first season...well, this is more of it. Not as funny though. I feel like i saw it all during the first season.",1431302400,,127,3.923076923076923
6474346,5,B00L8LD9PI,"Holy Jesus this parody is fantastic! Spot-on! If you've ever seen any of the ""reality"" romance shows you will get such a kick out of Burning Love's three seasons.",1426377600,2,162,4.620689655172414
6474347,5,B00L8LD9PI,"For anyone who has watched The Bachelor/Bachelorette/Bachelor Pad shows, this parody is simply genius!!  From the over-the-top personalities, to the not-so-subtle inuendos, I couldn't get enough!  I'm only sorry they made the three seasons!",1425686400,,240,6.029411764705882
6474348,5,B00L8LD9PI,Every bit as funny as Season 1--which is a classic!,1424995200,,51,4.2
6474349,5,B00L8LD9PI,this series is super funny,1423094400,,26,4.4
6474350,5,B00L8LD9PI,"This is hilarious. The Burning Love: Julie season is very well done and pokes fun at a bunch of aspects of the real Bachelorette, on ABC. The creators definitely did their homework and it shows - it's a great parody.

The Burning Love: Burning Down the House season actually had me crying with laughter. Again, they get an A++ for taking the time to watch real seasons of The Bachelor Pad (the show it parodies) and use situations in their show. The stand out for me was Lexi. Lexi had funny scenes in the orginial Burning Love series with Mark Orlando; however, in this one she stole the show. Her breakdown over Blaze picking Annie over her was hilarious and the best scenes in the show.",1422835200,2,689,4.468253968253968
6474351,5,B00L8LD9PI,All three seasons of burning love I think are very funny. Pretty edgy and sometimes outrageous. I think it's a super parody of The Bachelor and the Bachelorette,1422748800,2,160,4.75
6474352,5,B00L8LD9PI,"OMG!  HILARIOUS!  Even if you are not a fan of The Bachelor or Bachelorette, you will laugh out loud.  LOVE IT!  I own season 1 too.",1422316800,2,132,3.9615384615384617

8664332,5,B00L8LD9PI,Do yourself a favor a just buy this right now. Great for any comedy fan as well as a must own for fans of ABC's The Bachelor or Bachelorette.,1532908800,,141,3.896551724137931

8664337,5,B00L8LD9PI,Insanely funny show. All the seasons are superb,1458777600,,47,5.0
8664338,3,B00L8LD9PI,"Movie was set up like a play that was staged, I didn't know if they were serious or if it was suppose to be a joke.",1448409600,,115,3.4615384615384617
8664339,5,B00L8LD9PI,Fantastic show with an all-star cast.,1439510400,,37,5.333333333333333
8664340,4,B00L8LD9PI,Both seasons of the show  are very funny and a must have for  anyone who likes watching general parodies or who just wants a good laugh.  What drew me to this show in the first place was Micheal Ian Black but the more I watched the more infectious I found the other characters featured .  The two seasons are mainly parodies of the Bachelorette and other dating reality shows.,1439251200,2,376,4.405797101449275
