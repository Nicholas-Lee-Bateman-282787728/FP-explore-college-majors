8326606,5,B001NCE3MU,"this is really a beautiful and relaxing dvd for everyone who loves the sea. You never see people, you just sit there and watch the ocean, there are 17 different scenes, each some minutes long. Not too long, not too short. You can choose between music or natural sounds only. The natural sounds only option is a must for such a dvd. Hearing the waves relaxes much more than music ever could. The picture quality is very good,filmed in HD.
Im from germany and saw the preview of the HanaScapes DVD, which in my opinion will be even more beautiful than this one.
There you see beautiful ocean scenes again, but also palm trees in the wind and a breathtaking bamboo forest. Im really looking forward to that one. But as long as it not available, you can buy this one which is great, too!",1287878400,,783,4.406896551724138
