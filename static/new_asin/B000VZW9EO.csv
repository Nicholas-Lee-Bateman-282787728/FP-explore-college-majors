8220777,2,B000VZW9EO,"I had expected more. Usually Spacecraft Films produce a quality product, but there was a lot of useless filler footage and the narration was weak. One beef I have, you never saw a complete rendering of the Gemini B/MOL assembly. I wished I had saved some of the stuff I saw, when I was a kid. I thought the MOL was cool!",1329004800,,320,4.17741935483871
8220778,5,B000VZW9EO,"Man In Space: U.S. Air Force Manned Space Projects was a great five star DVD by Spacecraft Films.  This movie shows how the Air Force always believed it had an important future in space and planned for it. Early pioneering work is included with an emphasis on man in space including: Man High Balloon, Excelsior Balloon, X-20 Dyna-Soar, Manned Orbiting Laboratory and the U.S. Air Force Gemini designs.  Much, much more.  All this Air Force research has played an important role in modern space medicine, high altitude bail out capability, the space shuttle, and our modern space stations.  Great footage has been recovered from archives illustrating X-20 R&D, wind tunnel work, fractional scale aero-models, etc.",1240790400,,713,5.173913043478261
8220779,4,B000VZW9EO,"This is a great 'doco' DVD for space buffs.  It has archive footage from USAF promotional films where the film stock has survived in fairly good condition.  The scenes introducing the Dynasoar and Blue Gemini Astronauts are classics of 60's military kitsch, but the footage of project Man High and Joe Kittinger are just awesome.

Includes some audio commentary to 'fill in' for the silent footage, a nice touch and the comentater is obviously 'one of us' with a love of all things from the 60's USA space program.

If you are a space buff then this will be a classic in your collection - if you are just curious then it may take up too much valuable shelf space...",1211500800,2,665,4.516666666666667
8220780,4,B000VZW9EO,"The Man in Space DVD features the Air Force programs Man-high, ,Dyna-soar and Blue Gemini. the first of these was simply testing how man could live at high, but still sub-orbital altitudes. The second, Dyna-soar, was a one-place space plane, a direct ancestor of the current Shuttle. The third, Blue Gemini, was a space station  to be used in reconnaissance ., prefiguring both Skylab and our current spy satellites.
Of these three, only Man-high was actually operational. The Dyna-soar and Blue Gemini had some hardware developed, but never made it to the launch pad.
This DVD makes the best of  what footage remained from these programs to provide a look at a space program that might have been, with a space station and shuttle operating side-by-side with the Apollo Lunar program, a future sixty years ahead of  what actually came to pass.  The Orin Lunar missions are scheduled to begin in 2019.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Last-Man-on-the-Moon-Astronaut-Eugene-Cernan-and-America-s-Race-in-Space/dp/0312263511/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Last Man on the Moon: Astronaut Eugene Cernan and America's Race in Space</a><a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Giant-leap-for-mankind-Petersen-s-book-of-man-in-space/dp/0822700751/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Giant leap for mankind (Petersen's book of man in space)</a><a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Man-In-Space-U-S-Air-Force-Manned-Space-Projects/dp/B000VZW9EO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Man In Space: U.S. Air Force Manned Space Projects</a>",1201046400,3,1619,7.416666666666667
8220781,4,B000VZW9EO,"Spacecraft Films scores another triumph with this interesting collection of US Air Force footage.  Space enthusiasts will really get a kick out of seeing the footage about the preparation, launch and recovery of the Manned Orbital Laboratory mockup, as well as information on Gemini B and X-20 (Dyna-Soar).  This material harkens back to a time when the United States feared that the Soviet Union would dominate space from the military standpoint, and were willing to do what it took to prevent that from happening.",1200700800,3,515,5.119047619047619
