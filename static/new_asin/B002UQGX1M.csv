8381470,4,B002UQGX1M,"MASTER AND COMMANDER (2003) works best in its depiction of the relationship between a beloved ship's captain (Russell Crowe) and his crew. A dinner scene is particularly engaging, as are the cultured moments of violin and cello duets. Manueverings off the coast of South America between frigate HMS Surprise and the more formidible French vessel the Acheron are also most interesting.

This film is a letdown however in the all-important boarding and hand-to-hand battle sequence. Shot with the shakiest of handheld cameras, it's absolutely impossible to follow what's going on, practically until the skirmish's outcome is decided. If the intention here was to baffle the viewer, this film's creators succeeded in my case. Yet, being served home movie quality smeary action after eagerly anticipating a thrilling swashbuckler of cutlass, dirk and bludgeon is just very unsatisfying to this sea adventure fan.

In all other regards, ""M & C: The Far Side Of The World"" is a fine motion picture.

Director Roger Donaldson's THE BOUNTY (UK/USA-1984) is my favorite version of an oft-told story.
With Mel Gibson, Anthony Hopkins, Daniel Day-Lewis, Edward Fox, Bernard Hill, Liam Neeson and Laurence Olivier.

This one has the ring of truth to it, especially during the post-mutiny story, where Lt. Bligh and a crew of 18 loyal men successfully navigate a ship's launch across a vast ocean to the island of Timor, some 3,600 nautical miles from where they were cast adrift. This remarkable feat may have weighed heavily in Bligh's favor during a naval inquest into the events surrounding the April 1789 mutiny, for he was cleared of culpability and subsequently continued his career in the Royal service.

The Tahiti portion of this picture is quite spectacular, especially for those who enjoy the sight of dozens of young lovelies naked from the waist up. It's also interesting to see the local customs, including a feast that has for entertainment a most sexual ritual dance.

Each main actor has his spotlights, often several. One of Gibson's most convincing is the emotional turmoil his Spencer Christian endures as he prepares to commit Bligh and several crewmembers to certain death in a small open boat. Hopkins' Capt. Bligh shines in his determination to pull his men through the terrible ordeal they now faced.

If you like sea adventures, ""The Bounty"" is surely one of the very best!",1409011200,,2389,5.09462915601023
