The producer of this film is the infamous Jack Abramoff, who also produced and was screenwriter on the first ""Red Scorpion"".

Let's see: David Safavian of U.S. gov. O.M.B. has been indicted and is under arrest for lying about Abramoff's matters as related to Safavian's office. Abramoff is being investigated by Sen. McCain's Indian Affairs Committee for allegedly defrauding tribes of tens of millions of lobbying fees. Abramoff has illegally paid for golf junkets for Tom DeLay, Ralph Reed and Bob Ney. Abramoff used to be lobbyist for sweatshop owners in the Marianas Islands and used his influence through DeLay to block having U.S. labor standards applying to the islands even though the North Marianas are a U.S. posession. And, Abramoff is currently under indictment as he and a partner, Kadin, allegedly executed a fraudulant bank-transfer in order to convince the owner of some Fla. pleasureboats, Gus Boulis, that the capital was there so that sale of said boats could be made.

Kadin then paid a couple of guys whose names are ""Tony"" over $200K for what is accounted for as ""surveillence and catering fees"". Boulis was soon knocked off as the path of his BMW was blocked by one auto and another pulled up alongside- Boulis was shot multiple times.

I bet this movie is nowhere near as interesting as Abramoff's real life.",1129161600,2,1431,4.852459016393443
