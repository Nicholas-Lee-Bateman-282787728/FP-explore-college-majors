4062967,5,B00331RHCM,"George Gently, played by Martin Shaw, is the kind of Chief Detective Inspector that we all would want advising us and working for us in our town. Detective Gently is from the UK and rose through the ranks at Scotland Yard. His wife was murdered in front of his eyes and he decided to retire. However, a case came his way that involved his wife's murderer, and he took it. The case took him to the north of England, Northumberland, near the Scottish border, and he found he liked it. Gently found his new home.

The time is 1964, England is still in the leeway between the conservative UK and the new generation that wants to be free. The bouffant hairdos, the shirt and ties and blue suits. The times they are a'changin', but The Beatles have not invaded as of yet. Northumberland seems to be the seat of drug running and other crimes, and Chief Detective Inspector is kept quite busy. His partner in crime, so to speak, is young Detective Sergeant, Lee Ingleby, aka John Bacchus. Detective Sgt Bacchus
is a work in progress, and Gently has some work in front of him. Bacchus is very young, but determined to be the best detective he can be. He is married to the Chief Constable's daughter, and it appears he married her because she was pregnant, and not because he loved her. We can see trouble on the horizon. We don't know much about Gently's personal life, this is all business, and he is having difficulty while mourning his wife's death.

Gently is a very classy man, and he is a perfectionist. He is also one of the more intelligent detectives, and we learn how he solves a case. He is polite, does not believe in brutality with the people who he arrests or brings in for questioning. Brutality seems to be the right of passage at this time, and it is a good lesson that Gently bestows on Bacchus.  The cases they solve are extraordinary and so well written. This is a series that keeps us involved and interested. An intelligent series that appeals to the masses.  The mystery series that the UK brings to us are addicting.  They are far and above some of the best written shows.  No wonder that PBS brings these shows to us. George Gently and John Bacchus become involved in murders at a sex club, with corrupt politicians, gangs, drug running and in-between run into racism. They deal with all of this deftly and rarely encounter violence.

One of the better mystery series from the UK. I read recently that the George Gently series will continue, and we shall see more of a detective series that has become a favorite.

Highly Recommended.  prisrob 06-21-10

4062968,5,B00331RHCM,"""George Gently: Series 2,"" a first-rate television series of British mysteries/police procedurals that has never been broadcast in the United States,  debuted in the United Kingdom on BBC1 in May 2009.  It's set in Northeast Britain, Geordie country, amid the upheavals and excesses of the 1960s. The production stars respected, award-winning actor Martin Shaw (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Judge-John-Deed-Season-One-Pilot-Episode/dp/B002XTBEE2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Judge John Deed: Season One & Pilot Episode</a>) as Commander George Gently; and is based on the long-running series of detective novels by Alan Hunter. It comes in a boxed,  four DVD set of four feature-length episodes, running approximately 88 minutes each, for a total of  356 min., with subtitles, thank goodness, as Geordie-speak falls hard upon American ears.

Gently is an inconveniently incorruptible top cop, disliked almost as much by his colleagues as by criminal elements, and, therefore, bounced from Scotland Yard to Northumbria.  There he finds an unexpected ally in ambitious young Sergeant John Bacchus, an overeager, opinionated young man who tends to play fast and loose with police procedures, a part played by Lee Ingleby (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Nicholas-Nickleby/dp/B00009MEJ4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Nicholas Nickleby</a>).

The well-written, stylishly directed, absorbing mysteries unfold against a beautiful backdrop we're meant to think is rural Britain, though as the series was partly financed by the Irish Film Board, I wonder if we aren't looking at beautiful rural Ireland. There are excellent supporting casts, extras aplenty, and the characters' clothing and cars are appropriate to the era, when Britain was beginning to shake off its post-war deprivation and depression, and London was beginning to swing a bit.

The mysteries are:
""Gently with the Innocents.""  When local real estate developer Cora Davidson shows up at a newly-purchased property slated for demolition, she finds the unhappy seller butchered in his backyard.  Suspicion falls on a mute gardener.

""Gently in the Night.""  A pretty young woman clothed and shod a la mod, in go-go boots, turns up murdered, laid out on the altar of a Newcastle church.  Investigation reveals she worked at Rake's, a Playboy Club clone that is drawing unwanted attention from religious protesters.

""Gently in the Blood.""  Another lovely young woman found murdered, shortly after giving birth to a child that has started questions; the theft of expired passports; potential violent ethnic hatreds in a seaside town; the victim's boyfriend involved with a gang of Arab toughs.  This powerful episode actually reduced me to tears, a rare happening for a mystery series.

""Gently Through the Mill.""  Patrick Fuller, mill manager, found hanged from the rafters of his workplace.  Suicide or murder? Investigation uncovers adultery, embezzlement, corruption.

These are substantial, complex plots, driven by vivid characters, and strong women, and I found them quite gripping.  Shaw plays the title character as a man of gravitas, and an insightful detective.  I found the 60's setting more recognizable in this second series than the first: Bacchus has a Beatles haircut, and the girls wear white go-go boots; perhaps what we think of as the 60's didn't really get smoking until 1964.  Of course, the quality of the film work still makes obvious that this is a contemporary work. We need to see brief scenes of people smoking where they ought not to today, hear prices quoted in the old money, pounds, shillings and pence, or, I suppose, the capital punishment scenes serve as pretty good reminders of the historical setting, too.

Initially, I'd wondered how much of the Swinging Sixties actually went north, until the setting of the second episode, in a Playboy-club like venue in Newcastle, reminded me that two of the greatest British films noir of the twentieth century were set in contemporaneous Newcastle.  You've got<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Get-Carter/dp/0790750716/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Get Carter</a>, apparently based on a true life case, starring Michael Caine, who's always played a great gangster, with a stellar supporting cast behind him.  And then there's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Stormy-Monday/dp/B000069HZZ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Stormy Monday</a>, that was apparently filmed in Newcastle as a homage to ""Get Carter;"" it starred Sean Bean, Tommy Lee Jones, and Melanie Griffith.  So we can rest assured; the once-quiet northeast corner of England, far from London, got to experience the social, sexual, and political changes that characterized the 1960s as we knew them. Worth the trip, any time.",1275696000,8,5496,6.400541271989175
4062969,5,B00331RHCM,"I have just completed Season 2 of the ""Gently"" series, and feel sad that there aren't more of this outstanding series available.  Martin Shaw is as fine an actor as I have seen for many years; both as Gently and Judge Deed.  The writing is remarkable - one can see that great minds and labor go into these plots.  Bravo to the acting and the writing.  Please keep the series going.  Thank You",1275696000,,392,4.315068493150685
4062970,5,B00331RHCM,"BBC excellence in another series of a great TV show. Series 2 is even better than the first. In the 1st, George Gently is a fearless London crime fighter cop who moves to Northumberland (NE England) after his wife is murdered. Gently has not given up fighting crime of all sorts and is now Chief Inspector in the new, and extremely beautiful north countryside.

Perhaps even better than the great plots of crime that Gently faces is the relationship with his Sargent John Bacchus (Lee Ingleby-'Nicholas Nicleby'), a very young assistant in the investigations, intent on learning from and outdoing his leader, Gently. Their work together, dialogue, and personal relationship is often funny--always entertaining. Ingleby is as good at being Bacchus as star Martin Shaw ('Judge John Deed''The Professionals''Master and Commander')is at being the not-so-gentle-Gently.

The show is very comparable to other perfections in British Crime/Mystery Drama such as ""Murdoch Mysteries""-Victorian era crime, ""Foyles War""-WWII era crime, and ""Midsomer Murders"" country village crime outside of London. This ""GEORGE GENTLY"" series takes place in 1964, as authentic in detail to the era as the other shows, although not as many murders as Midsome--but they try at times. Gently doesn't have as large a group of assistants as Murdoch--but he gets all he needs in help and entertainment factor from his one primary partner in sleuthing. Masterful writing in this Cop-copper relationship, youth pitted against the old, experience against initiative, big-city experience vs small-town skill.

Episodes include:
1 Gently with the Innocents--murder in a children's home.
2 Gently in the Night--corpse on a church altar.
3 Gently in the Blood--passport fraud, murder, Arab intolerance, more.
4 Gently Through the Mill--is it suicide or murder? Why?
+ Bonus, text interviews with the 2 coppers, notes, fun 1964 facts.
SDH SUBTITLES are PROVIDED
4 feature-length episodes, each 89 minutes, each serve as great stand-alone crime mystery films tied together only by a 1964 date, a wonderful location, and 2 great roles.

4062974,5,B00331RHCM,"""George Gently"" Series 2 continues the saga of veteran Detective Inspector George Gently (Martin Shaw), displaced from his former career at the Met in London to North East England, and his ambitious but less ethically encumbered sidekick Detective Sergeant John Bacchus (Lee Ingleby), who has his sights set on a London job. Like the first series, Series 2 takes place in 1964 and interweaves the social issues of the day with the murder plots. Bacchus is fully in the 1960s now with a shag haircut. The relationship between Gently and Bacchus is becoming more paternal and less adversarial, though some tension results from Bacchus' strained financial situation, as he tends to covet the lifestyle of the Swinging Sixties and spend beyond his means. The cast is top-notch, and this series embraces the mores of its era rather than populate the stories with anachronisms to which the audience could relate more easily.

Some of the social issues on which the show touches this season are the decriminalization of suicide, child sexual abuse in the face on an incredulous public, birth control for unmarried women, the temptations and pitfalls of the sexual revolution, racial discrimination against British Arabs, and the appeal of socialism among the working classes. The show isn't usually heavy-handed with its social issues, with some exceptions. They come up as part of the characters' lives. Rather than approach the issue pedantically, the writers show the opinions on these issues in the 1960s. It is interesting to be reminded where people were coming from, as people take arguments as self-evident today that were a lot less clear fifty years ago in a different social context. The first disc includes text interviews of Martin Shaw, Lee Ingleby, Producer Johann Knobel Notes, and 1964 Historical Facts. All discs include optional English SDH subtitles and a scene index.

The episodes are:

""Gently with the Innocents"" finds DS Bacchus reluctantly lecturing high school students about a career in the police force, when the body of 75-year-old Alfred Peachment (Brian de Salvo) is found beaten in the garden of his home, the grand old Harrison House, formerly an orphanage. He was discovered by Cora Davidson (Jill Halfpenny), a property developer who purchased the house in order to tear it down and build smaller homes. Peachment had contested the demolition, saying that the planning commission's decision was based on a false assessment of the property's condition. Bacchus suspects this to be the motive for murder, as the brother-in-law of Peachment's estranged wife Enid (Georgine Anderson) conducted the survey. But the familiar relationship between the first police officer on the scene, Sgt. Blacksmith (Mark Stobbart), and Peachment's mute gardener, as well as Davidson's past, suggest another avenue of investigation.

The body of a young woman is found laid out on a Newcastle church altar, dead of a head injury, in ""Gently in the Night."" Audrey Chadwick's (Sian Breckin) family says she was studying to be a nurse, but Bacchus recognizes her from ""Rake's Club"", a gentleman's club and casino where he has been spending too much time and money. Audrey was a cocktail waitress there, who made the members feel special while dressed as a ""fox"", Rake's version of a Playboy bunny. The club's owner is American Patrick Donovan (Brenden Coyle), who, with his English wife Helen (Clare Calbraith), wants to introduce sex and glamour to stodgy England and make a lot of money in the process. Audrey had recently quit her job at Rake's, but the Donovans claim not to know why. Audrey's roommate, another ""fox"" named Fawn Granger (Nichola Burley) is frightened and points them in the direction of Audrey's violent ex-boyfriend, but Gently questions the nature of her relationship with DS Bacchus.

In the coastal town of South Shields, DI Gently and DS Bacchus stake out a cemetery to capture the sale of stolen passports in ""Gently in the Blood."" The perpetrator gets away, but a suitcase containing 200 expired passports is recovered. The next day, they inquire at the local passport office, managed by Phillip Saint (Joe Simpson), who explains that expired passports are sent to London by post without any security. Bacchus interviews Maggie Alderton (Robyn Addison), a young single mother, who bagged the batch of passports that were subsequently stolen. Bacchus believes she is hiding something, and this seems to be confirmed when her body washes up on the beach the next day. The father of her child was high school sweetheart Jimmy Cochran (Andrew Lee Potts), and who left Maggie over questions of the paternity of her baby. Jimmy does business with Hamed (Tariq Jordan) an Arab who deals in black market passports and people smuggling.

Bacchus is contemplating a career move to London, and DI Gently is discouraging him, when Patrick Fuller is found hanged in the attic of Rinto Mill, where he was manager. The death is assumed to be suicide, but Fuller left no note, and petty cash is missing from his office lockbox. The mill's new owner, Geoffrey Penshore (Tim McInnerny), is a popular socialist running for political office in a hotly contested election in County Durham 1964. Bacchus takes an instant dislike to Penshore, and he and Gently make the rounds of the mill employees, rattling the cages of Fuller's young secretary Julie (Kate Heppell), the incompetent Sam Draper (Tom Goodman-Hill) whom Fuller inexplicably appointed foreman, volatile Jed Jimpson (Justin McDonald) who was overlooked for the job, and old friends Henry and Mary Blythely (Nicholas Jones and Anne Hornby). Bacchus' career ambition drives his actions on this case, and we finally meet his wife Lisa (Melanie Clark Pullen).",1491523200,,5729,5.135048231511254

4063038,5,B00331RHCM,"I must confess that I'm not a huge devotee of British mystery series, but George Gently, based on a slew of novels by the late Alan Hunter, hooked me from the start.  The stories are intricate and textured, without being outlandish or far fetched. The attention to period detail and the production value are outstanding. The characters are not without flaws, and their relationships with each other are complex. The casting is brilliant -- I liked Martin Shaw in The Last Place on Earth, and his depiction of Gently is marvelous, as is Lee Ingleby's rendition of Bacchus. The two have grown on each other since the start of the series, and the series has definitely grown on me. This is one television series that one can settle in with like a good book. Highly recommended, even for non-mystery buffs like myself.",1394668800,,814,4.732394366197183
4063039,5,B00331RHCM,I'm a big fan of George Gently.  A really good British detective series set in the 60s and very authentic.  Martin Shaw is terrific as Inspector George Gently and his sidekick played my Lee Inglesby is perfect casting.

4063040,5,B00331RHCM,"Although the George Gently series is not well known in our area, I took a chance on it based on viewer descriptions from other areas.  The two principal characters (George Gently and his partner, John Bacchus) are extremely well acted, making each episode fun to watch.  The plots are absorbing, although, of course, it's getting harder and harder to invent any really new plots for television detectives (the theme of one episode in this series had my spouse and I trying to recall what other British series we had previously seen with essentially the same story line).  And sometimes the pace is a bit slow.  But the acting is just so darned good and the main characters are so compelling, and their interaction so much fun to watch, that we really aren't bothered by these minor faults.  In fact, Martin Shaw's quiet, dignified, riveting performance as George Gently is equal in every respect to Michael Kitchen's (justifiably) highly praised performances in the Foyle's War series.  Likewise, Lee Ingleby's take on Sgt. Bacchus, Gently's tempestuous, immature sidekick, is very well done.  George Gently is a great series.",1388361600,,1126,5.021505376344086
4063041,5,B00331RHCM,"George Gently manages to be different. On the surface, it is similar: set in the 1960s, with a younger, more foolish detective assisting him.

How is it different?

Brilliantly written, but not dwelling on witty one-liners, the characters are believable. Neither is perfect, but clearly, Inspector George Gently holds a higher moral and ethical standard than Detective Sergeant John Bacchus.

The cases themselves are ordinary enough -- usually murder with some interesting nuances. As it is set in the 1960s, the writers draw from the era for issues, police procedures and cultural milieu. While they aren't in the thick of protests and court cases, they are impacted from a distance just as anyone was then.

As is typical of British TV that makes it to the States, production values are high. Each episode is much like a movie, not rushing through plot points. The relationship between Gently and Bacchus develops show by show, never beyond the reality of each character. The viewer is always left satisfied by the show's end, waiting impatiently for the next one to be released.

I fully recommend George Gently.

The Gently-Bacchus relationship was yet to mean anything much and the plots had nothing much to do with the 60s (besides Bacchus' hair). But, if Harry's love of gardening as a motive is your thing, go for it. I'd rather skip to season 3, when the production staff suddenly hit on the idea that a series set in the 60s could actually be ABOUT the 60s.

4063051,5,B00331RHCM,"If you are a fan of British police procedurals, GEORGE GENTLY is a quality entry into the genre and has its own particular flavor and charm.  Working in the north of England in the early 1960's Gently uses his native wit and experience to solve crimes with the help of his young assistant Bacchus.

Bacchus seems quite flawed, a bit of a twit, really and annoying.  But George Gently is fairly gentle and rather patient with him, so we will have to be also.  They both seem like real people, not actors playing a role.  Gently is classy, courtly almost, and dominates every scene he is in. Love his voice and facial expressions.  He deals skilfully, intuitively and intelligently with witnesses, victims and possible suspects.  He is not afraid to buck his superiors but only when necessary.

While the series is set in the 1960's, it has a contemporary feel.  The plots are more important than the time setting.  The series should grow on you as you become more enamored with its characters and scenery.  Bacchus will have to grow a bit more, to my sense, not to irritate but he livens up the show with his antics and immaturity.  It will be interesting to watch his development.

Hope they keep producing this show for a long time.",1359504000,,1233,4.60091743119266

Of my BBCs, two are mysteries; George Gently, and Midsomer Murders, which I will be collecting throughout the coming years. Though I may have to watch some them twice, gladly, because of language and accent, I am very impressed. And there good quality too; filming and location.

In Season two (2), there are four (running about an hour and one-half)  superb mysteries that kept me ""on the edge of my seat"".

All of the very complex mysteries in Season two (2) are solved without, of course, any ""high tech"" help The mysteries are superbly solved by old fashioned ""leg work"" and supreme intuition by detectives George Gently and his partner Detective Bacchus.  Gently is wonderfully acted by the  very mellow sounding but with keen insights to ""how humans tick"", Martin Shaw. John Bacchus, his opposite but with keen insights too is greatly acted by Lee Ingleby.  This season in spite of their differences they are really a good detective team.

4063058,5,B00331RHCM,"BBC excellence in another series of a great TV show. Series 2 is even better than the first. In the 1st, George Gently is a fearless London crime fighter cop who moves to Northumberland (NE England) after his wife is murdered. Gently has not given up fighting crime of all sorts and is now Chief Inspector in the new, and extremely beautiful north countryside.

Perhaps even better than the great plots of crime that Gently faces is the relationship with his Sargent John Bacchus (Lee Ingleby-'Nicholas Nicleby'), a very young assistant in the investigations, intent on learning from and outdoing his leader, Gently. Their work together, dialogue, and personal relationship is often funny--always entertaining. Ingleby is as good at being Bacchus as star Martin Shaw ('Judge John Deed''The Professionals''Master and Commander')is at being the not-so-gentle-Gently.

The show is very comparable to other perfections in British Crime/Mystery Drama such as ""Murdoch Mysteries""-Victorian era crime, ""Foyle's War""-WWII era crime, and ""Midsomer Murders"" country village crime outside of London. This ""GEORGE GENTLY"" series takes place in 1964, as authentic in detail to the era as the other shows, although not as many murders as Midsomer--but they try at times. Gently doesn't have as large a group of assistants as Murdoch--but he gets all he needs in help and entertainment factor from his one primary partner in sleuthing. Masterful writing in this Cop-copper relationship, youth pitted against the old, experience against initiative, big-city experience vs small-town skill.

Episodes include:
1 Gently with the Innocents--murder in a children's home.
2 Gently in the Night--corpse on a church altar.
3 Gently in the Blood--passport fraud, murder, Arab intolerance, more.

The first one featuring digusting pedophiles and the way society up to that time denied that it was a problem is probably the most powerful of the lot.  The murder mysteries are serious stuff here and very realistic as well as the storylines.  When watching this show you see just where british society was at during the period, they were strangled by conventions and lack of personal freedom, unfortunately now the uk has so far the other way the place is out of control socially with the largest teen preg rate in europe and drug abuse rates are terrible too. not EVerything from the old world was bad and this show reflects that as well.  .  there must be a middle ground and this show is taking place when the old overly strict order was beginning to fade.  the other mysteries also feature some part of society that was in struggle then. like a playboy type club being seen as too sinful etc.  I do think that four eps addressing social issues and not just plain old murder does push it abit,but the writing is very well done. and the lead actor is so good that I would say he becomes his character. A good decent cop who knows whats right and wrong but knows if people go too far it will be chaos. which it is in the uk these days socially.
The dvd looks gorgeous too with the 1960's coming alive in vivid detail.  This show is top notch and I would say that I would be surprised if it's lead actor (shaw) doesn't win a british film award for this. He should, if he hasn't at least.  the extras are limited on this set, like most brit shows. And one must mention the great musical soundtrack made with real instruments. watching a detective show with rap or techno on it is enough to make me want to shut it off but here you get well written tunes and that helps.

On the other hand you have John Bacchus (Lee Ingleby), his superficial sargeant.  Superficial is a euphimism. He is crude, underhanded, overflowing with red neck philosophies, but redeemable.
