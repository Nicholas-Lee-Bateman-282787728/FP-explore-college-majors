8191135,5,B000PFUAMS,"It's great to watch Kenny play, much of it is split screen so you can watch what he is doing with either hand,  and he imparts a lot of good tips along the way, BUT the only caveat here is the quality of the video itself - as far as I can tell, my copy is not a bootleg, but the video quality is p*** poor - looks like it was transferred from a copy of a copy of a VHS tape onto DVD.  The highlights are blown out, which is a shame as it help in the close ups. Still a helpful video but should have looked better for something produced in 2007 - you've been warned...",1448841600,,567,3.7966101694915255
8191136,5,B000PFUAMS,"I bought this book several months ago, but it was very hard to figure out all the fingering arrangement just by the CD.
Now you can see all these fingering clearly through this DVD. Thank you Kenny Sultan. You are a very good blues guitar player!",1396051200,2,246,4.369565217391305
