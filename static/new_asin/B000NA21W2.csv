2764078,5,B000NA21W2,I love this movie and used to watch it a lot as a child and still enjoy watching it as an adult. In this DVD I've seen a lot of episodes I haven't seen on T.V In great condition and I loved it all. The only thing I didn't like was how they changed the voice of Tutenstein. I don't like the new voice very much,1345507200,2,309,3.696969696969697
