8417316,4,B0046HENFG,"Not much of this Danish film is based in Copenhagen, instead we see lots of Warsaw and Paris. Also there isn't much Danish spoken in this, much more English so the need for subtitles is far less. Of course when we hear Danish and Swedish (due to the main character's husband being Swedish), subtitles are provided.
Sonja Richter is fantastic in the role of the obsessed woman who dreams of a man only to meet him the following day. The film takes the viewer on the journey of a woman's obsession with the other man and makes for decent viewing.
Fine acting throughout, and seeing that the film has input from Denmark DR broadcaster gave me an assurance of something pretty gooid. I wasn't disappointed.
The only disappointment was that there was a lack of actors from recent Danish TV dramas in this, however I did notice Tammi st who will appear in The Killing 3 later in the year.",1351728000,,882,4.51875
