8263293,1,B0016MLILQ,"One of the worst movies that I've ever seen. Basically, to sum things up, the bad guy gets his fingers chopped off, get injected with a tube of air, and gets shot and somehow magically manages to teleport himself back to the original scene of the movie before the girls can get there. I have no idea why amazon is charging $12 for this, but I assure you it's not worth it. It's not even worth the $0.01 that you can get it for used on the marketplace. Stay away!",1388188800,,462,4.144444444444445
8263294,2,B0016MLILQ,"<strong>Alive or Dead</strong> (Stephen Goetsch, 2008)

Another one of those movies--I seem to run across more and more of them as time goes on--that starts out with so much potential and then knocks it all into a cocked hat by turning what looked as if it were going to be something very different into something tiredly, and incompetently, the same.

Goetsch (<em>Bleeding Iowa</em>), who also wrote the script, gives us the tale of Maria (<em>Pinko's Place</em>'s Ann Henson), who is driving through the desert for no reason we are ever given when she stumbles upon what seems, at first, to be an abandoned schoolbus. Well, ""stumbles"" isn't the proper term; she's snared, when one of those now-clich&eacute; ropes-with-nails-in-them catches her tires. There's another car there, abandoned, and she quickly discovers that (a) there's another woman, Sarah (<em>Richard III</em>'s Angelica Magana), already on the bus, shackled, and that (b) she was obviously put there by a very, very bad man (<em>Greed</em>'s Thomas Crnkovich), who comes back to the bus dragging what seems to be another victim, drugged, whom we later discover is named Frank (L. Flint Esquerra in his first film role). All of this is pretty standard, until said very, very bad man drives them to what would seem to be his compound... a massive castle. Yes, a massive castle, right there in the middle of the desert. That's when things start to get weird. (NOTE: the rest of this paragraph could be considered a spoiler, so SKIP TO THE NEXT PARAGRAPH if you don't want to know.) Maria and Sarah manage to overpower and kill the bus driver, leaving them and Frank, who now seems less drugged than mentally challenged, to explore the castle and try to figure out where they are.

If the movie had managed to stay in that mode, it might have been something glorious. Unfortunately, we get maybe three minutes of it before the entire thing devolves into pure, utter chaos, and worse yet, does so in the most predictable of ways. At which point you, like pretty much everyone else who has watched this movie is the ratings on the usual film sites are considered, will completely stop caring. As well you should. Nothing will happen after that point you don't expect if you've seen any three random slasher/torture porn films in your lifetime. Gets a couple of stars for its potential, but rest assured all of that potential is utterly wasted. **",1332979200,,2410,4.887530562347188
8263295,3,B0016MLILQ,"Okay, this is a very low-budget film, shot on what looks like amateur home video in the desert.  Probably all of the budget went towards renting the house, makeup effects, and hiring the hot girl (yes, the lead actress is quite a dish).  And there are aspects of the plot that cry out for rewrites.  But I didn't feel like I was wasting my time watching it (and not just because 90% of the film is footage of a smoking hot actress in skimpy clothes).  It had atmosphere in spades, and heaping helpings of paranoia.  Many people forget that horror films aren't just about gore and ""gotcha scenes"" (I hate those, so so cheap) but about psychological horror.  The director of this film is clearly capable of good horror film-making, of building tension and setting the mood, and of convincingly establishing a location.  I'd like to see him spend more time on a more solid script for his next movie.  There are two major flaws with the plot.  The first is the opening phone sex scene.  I almost didn't watch the movie because of this.  The second is one or two ""the-killer-who-really-ought-to-be-dead-because-he's-been-shot-and-stabbed-so-much-but-is-mysteriously-still-alive-and-threatening"" moments near the end.",1293753600,,1211,5.127551020408164

8263299,4,B0016MLILQ,"I have been kind of surprised with the real negative reviews of this movie.  I have seen much much worst.  I am glad I rented this movie because I actually enjoyed it. Yes, there is a lot in this movie that makes absolutely no sense but I found the atmosphere to be quite creepy and I thought it was good for a B horror movie especially with some of the other stuff that has been released lately.  I was not bored watching this movie and felt like it moved along at a pretty good pace which is important for me- I hate when you watch a movie for 80 min and it seems like 3 hours.  I would give this 3 stars but it doesn't deserve just a star so I am giving it an extra star for that reason.  Rent it and give it a chance.",1248912000,,721,3.877551020408163
