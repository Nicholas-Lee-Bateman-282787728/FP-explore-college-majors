1356077,5,B00004UEEH,"In the fourth DVD of the Tenchi Universe Washu has invented the Dimensional Cause & Effect controller.  It allows you to shape the world into any form you want.  When the girls ALL try to use it at the same time it, of course, goes haywire and ends up putting them all into one parallel universe after another.  Each world SHOULD be the ultimate fantasy world, but these dreams seem to end up as nightmares.  The first world seems to be old Japan, where Ayeka is a noblewoman and Tenchi is engaged to marry her.  When Tenchi is sent by the Emperor to deal with a demon, Ryoko, things are not what they appear to be.  Ayeka's world becomes a nightmare when she finds out that Ryoko is Tenchi's mistress!
The next world is just as weird.  Kiyone has escaped Mihoshi by leaving her career as a police officer behind her.  She ends up getting a job in a sleeply port town at a diner-tavern.  But Mihoshi finds her.  It turns out the dimwit has been searching for her and plans to be her ""Partner forever...""
As Kiyone runs screaming into the night we pop over to the next world - Sasami's world of the Magical Girl Pretty Sammy.  She uses her magic power to make Ryoko and Ayeka stop fighting over Tenchi.  In fact she uses too much magic and they fall in love, but the episode ends before they can kiss.  The next two worlds are just as interesting.  Mihoshi's world is one where she and Tenchi are married, yet her sister-in-law is Ayeka and Ryoko, a widow from next door, comes to flirt with Tenchi. Mihoshi cries.  Ryoko's world is set in the roaring twenties, with Ryoko and Tenchi as bank robbers.  The interesting thing here is that, while Ryoko is having great fun she figures out that everything is fake.  She allows Washu to cancel her world, like the redhead did to the others as they came to a end, and everything is back to normal.  This DVD is just pure fun.  It not only allows you to dive right into the characters' minds, but really allows you to laugh at events that would never of happened without Washu's weird machine.  Kind of a ""What-If"" series of episodes.",1087603200,,2076,4.384816753926701
1356078,4,B00004UEEH,"Perhaps the problem readers and interpreters of a contemporary author face is to take up the impromptu of a work and consider it of definitive value in terms of his epoch.  This seems to be the case with this documentary on Brodsky.  Take the poet and make him a product of his time without considering the response of his work and you have an indictment against your time (easy trick, by the way).  Like many another in his time and geography, Brodsky had a dramatic life encompassed in an exile: out of a homeland smitten by the Stalinist terror and, worse for the poet, away from his mother tongue.
""A Maddening Space"" underlines this dramatic scope and shows something of a hero that, I believe, Brodsky never intended to become.  His poetry and overall writings, of genious caliber, are not presented in this video to the extend one might hope.  The impression one gets, if one is not familiar enough with the works of Brodsky, is that he was a talented man of letters that suffered a lot.  What about the candor -even humor- and life-commitment of his writings?  Why ""a maddening space"" when Brodsky's poetry only expands our will to endure?
Yet, this documentary is a very well deserved tribute.  A good invitation, at least, if one manages to lower the hero role and bring back the poet, the man...",1079049600,4,1306,4.623376623376624

1356082,5,B00004UEEH,"This is volume 4/8, but it's by far my favorite of the series.
The base story
Washu's most recent ingenious invention is hijacked by the dreams of Ryoko, Aeka, Mihoshi, Kione and Sasami. Washu's device is one that creates alternative realities based upon the wishes of the user.  So, the girls' deepest desires (ummm, basicly involving Tenchi) become manifest...
Poor Tenchi. Now the girls are chasing him across alternate dimensions of spacetime!  Each alternative reality is a stand-alone mini story in its own right.  Nice segway between the  ""on earth"" and ""in space"" Tenchi Universe episodes.
My favorite is Sasami's reality, where she becomes Pretty Sammy. (This is the 2nd instance of the Pretty Sammy character. She first appeared in the Mihoshi Special and later got her own OVA and TV series.)  In this story, she comes up with a most interesting strategy to win Tenchi's affections while addressing the emotional needs of Ryoko and Aeka!  Absolutely hilarious!  Perhaps the funniest moment in the entire series.
Must buy for dedicated Sasami/Pretty Sammy fans.",1015545600,2,1071,5.15606936416185
1356083,5,B00004UEEH,"Not sure if Tenchi Universe is for you?  Try these 3 episodes which make up a self-contained adventure in the midst of the Tenchi Universe story.  In other words, seeing these episodes out of sequence from the rest of the series will not leave you completely baffled to the whole plot, as is often the case when seeing anime series out of order.  Also, since these episodes are not central to the main plot of Tenchi Universe, if you don't feel like investing into the 8 dvd set, they stand on their own as a 'mini-series'.
Anyway, after that unusually long introduction, here is the main idea of ""Time and Space Adventures""...
Washu has invented her latest amazing technological wonder, a machine which can alter time and space to anyone's idea of a 'perfect' world.  Leave it to Ryoko and Ayeka to sneak in at night to try and use the machine for their own 'perfect' worlds with Tenchi.  After all the noise that ensues, and all the girls are fighting over the machine (much to Washu's horror), the button gets pushed, and space-time is changed around.  Each girl is cast off into their own 'perfect' world except Washu, who manages to stay in 'reality' and has her work cut out to eliminate the fantasy worlds one by one and get everything back to normal.  Everything goes smoothly until one girl has second thoughts about giving up her fantasy... you can guess who. -_^
In all, a fun way to spend 3 episodes, and a bit of a side excursion if you are watching the entire series in sequence.",999475200,3,1493,4.5278810408921935

Washu, the mad genius scientist, creates a machine that can make your dreams come true.  But, unbeknownst to Washu, her invention turns out to be too big a temptation for everyone, except forTenchi of course. One night, disaster happens when the machine is left unattended and the girls poise themselves to be the first ones to use it.  The fight results in a terrible accident that hurdles our heroes through time and space; condemning them to live the lifes and fantasies they could only wish for.  Would  Washu fix the machine on time to save her friends from ever wonder uncontrollably into parallel worlds? Of course she will, but not before everyone learns a valuable lesson about being more caring about those they love and true to their own feelings.",992131200,2,858,4.731543624161074

This series appears to have been produced by Australian public television at least 10 years ago but probably is much older.

All technologically-bound science like space science has a very short shelf life and this series seems to have exceeded the expiration date for most topics.

There are gems of knowledge but I just could not get past the poor audio production- all of her ""s"" sounds in any words she speaks are all whistles, very distracting! Also difficult to hear her clearly.  Then there's the scenery- really? if you could choose any studio why would you not pick one with full length mirrors? Plus, there's a gap/crack in the mirror which cuts through part of her reflected body image-weird.
There was just no attention to end product- why not take time to EASILY trouble shoot for these simple yet important aspects to an instructional DVD; considering there's no drills and a lot of dialogue.  The exercises she does I did like but at times it is difficult to see all the movements she creates. The music doesn't really go with the movements so that was distracting to me personally.  Another thing I hated was that the camera does go in and out of focus in one of the beginning parts of program, it looks as if this was self recorded.  I was disappointed and surprised at the quality given what's out there today and for this price point.  Most of the reviews were so positive and very little was said about the production quality (it's a DVD people), power of observation is needed.  I gave this 2 stars because Ms. Noreen is a skilled dancer but receives no stars for lighting, sound and framing of the video.

The only reason it would be for intermediate or advanced dancers is because she doesn't explain moves of belly dance.
The break down she explains for pauses are kind of a given. Nothing new there, especially if you have been this far into dance. I was expecting more information on the musicality; types of music, types of beats and phrasing, even song interpretation. That information would help you determine the mood and feeling you would want to convey when using pauses. None of that was mentioned.
The choreo was done to a repeating melody so you you do not get a sense as to why you would use those pauses. I would think the music would be of great importance in demonstrating why you would use that type of pause. It was based more on the 'technique' of a pause instead of why that pause.

A world with many different possibilities is created. Ryoko and Tenchi are on the run as bank robbers. Tenchi and Mihoshi have a daughter named Sasami, who is also a magical girl. Ayeka and Tenchi are engaged, but Tenchi is having and affair with the demon Ryoko. All of these are worlds desired by the girls. Washu has to eliminate each pf the worlds one by one to restore their lives to normal, but Ryoko doesn't want to leave.

This is a great DVD it shows what the world would be like if the girls had their way. The different stories are interesting and very funny. This is an excellent break in the series before the tense plot twist that is coming next.",1353024000,,950,4.3977272727272725
1356164,5,B00004UEEH,"I've had the pleasure of taking classes from Rosa and she is amazing!  This video is just an example of the skill, as a dancer and a teacher, that Rosa possesses. I recommend this video to any belly dancer looking to expand their dancing skills.",1338854400,3,245,4.444444444444445
1356165,5,B00004UEEH,"Negative space-that is, non-movement-is definitely an underutilized technique in belly dancing.  This DVD presents a topic that is completely new and fresh and interesting.  There's plenty of excellent content in this DVD, so it's worth the price.

This seems like such an easy topic at first, but it really isn't!  Pausing in dance, in the heat of the moment, is HARD.  But Rosa's explanations are perfect for incorporating stillness into your dance. Many dancers are afraid of not moving on stage, so these techniques are a must for any dancer wanting to advance their skills and get over that nervousness.  What I also like about this DVD is that it is not a beginner-level topic.  The movements themselves are not explained; her only explanations are how to utilize stillness within those movements.  This is great for more advanced dancers that don't need to sit through (yet another) teacher's technique explanation.

Rosa first presents the methodology and the techniques behind Delicious Pauses.  She then goes on to explain how to incorporate the different types of pauses into some common belly dance moves.  There are also sections for structured and improvised drilling of each movement with those pauses, which I think is fantastic.  Few DVDs incorporate time for improvisation drilling.  There are also two challenging combinations on the DVD, but both are clearly explained and drilled.  The combos perfectly integrate the techniques learned in the previous sections into a fun and beautiful dance.

The DVD itself is set up well, with easy navigation, a good menu, and correct chapter breaks.  The only problem is that, in some of the chapters, the sound quality isn't the greatest.  You can still understand Rosa with no problem, and the music is perfect, but her voice occasionally sounds a little tinny.  This is a very minor problem.

I definitely recommend this DVD, but remember, this is not a beginner-level topic.  It will be a challenge for intermediate students, and a good review/driller for more advanced dancers.

1356167,5,B00004UEEH,"Let me start by saying that I have my biases when it comes to bellydance. While there are many fabulous dancers who practice forms of it, the ones that make me happiest to watch -- and who most make me want to dance -- are those who dance with a certain kind of simplicity. Now, that doesn't mean simplicity is easy to achieve, but rather that they imbue the most basic movements with expression, fluidity, tension. And this is actually hard work. So right from the start, I was drawn to the concept behind Delicious Pauses: using drawn out movements, dramatic stops, and ""negative space"" to keep the audience engaged and interested.

The DVD itself has three sections. The first is a theoretical introduction, in which Rosa Noreen describes the kinds of pauses she will teach later in the DVD, along with some other principles of her methodology. I won't give away the whole bag here, but I will say the most interesting for me was her use of breath to aid either a sense of calmness or a dramatic move. I'm used to thinking about breath in yoga, but have never managed to do it much in dance, and this video really made me see how integral a part of dance conscious breath (and not just remembering to breathe) can be.

If you're like me, the theory will leave you interested but confused. This is where the second section comes in, a series of detailed exercises in which Rosa Noreen has you practice the different kinds of pauses. Now, this is very methodically done: for, say, undulations, she reviews all the principles, shows you how different pauses might work with an undulation, has you practice them in a follow-along drill (no talking, just on-screen text), and then has you improvise using the same movements.

I loved how incremental this strategy was, and how it kept building up on itself. Rosa Noreen repeats the concepts a lot, but it turns out they mean different things when applied to different movements. Having the theory and then showing all the ways it can be applied using practical exercises is just excellent teaching, in my opinion. And while only the main sections are in the DVD menu, the chaptering is detailed enough that I could easily skip to a certain section or repeat what I needed.

What I found was that once I hit the ""improv"" segments, my body started taking over... but it also started almost unconsciously incorporating the different kinds of pauses into other moves as well. This is really superb training for improv, because it's not about doing a million moves, but about being able to vary the basic moves in interesting ways. By the end of this video, you can do six variations on a horizontal hip figure 8 without really even thinking about it too much!

The final section includes two combinations that have you practice the pauses and concepts, this time in a slightly different way -- for example, with a languorous sweep of an arm, or a intentful pose. To be honest, they didn't look like much when I watched them, but I did find when doing them that they also ""taught"" in a different way than the theory and exercises. The combos are presented and drilled in super small increments, then added together, re-explained, and drilled. For someone who has an easy time learning choreography, this would probably be tiresome. I am not that person, so I happen to be happy for very slow choreo teaching, and kind of wish every teacher did it this way!

Delicious Pauses is only about 75 minutes long, but it contains material that will be worth going over repeatedly. Although all the instruction is with bellydance moves -- and you do have to know the moves already -- the concepts could be more generally applicable to dance. I've watched it through once and then worked with the exercises and choreo once, and already I feel different performing the same moves. I have a better sense not just of what it's like to slow down (and in fact, it's harder to slow down than to speed up), but the kinds of effects and sensations I can get from varying regular speed, staccato, and slow movements.

This is really smart stuff, and lot of thought and care has been put into the making of this DVD. I received a review copy from Rosa Noreen.",1330905600,16,4182,4.620457604306864
1356168,4,B00004UEEH,"This video is a fantastic addition to any dancer's library. While Rosa is a belly dancer, she clearly has ballet training and this information could translate into all types of dance-- modern, lyrical, even ballroom dance. She discusses different types of pauses (they're not all the same--who knew?) and then gives great ways to practice them. My favorite part was how calm and elegant Ms. Noreen was throughout the video. It's relaxing just listening to her voice. She leaves you feeling like you have the tools to bring your dance to the next level. The topic is fascinating, the explanations are clear... the sound could be a bit better, but all in all it's well worth the money. Highly recommended!",1330819200,6,703,4.866666666666666
1356169,5,B00004UEEH,"This DVD covers a topic which is often overlooked.  I find, especially with students, that the impulse to to speed though a performance.  Students, when they get nervous, speed up out of stress.  Yet we teach, and practice, that a great performance, whether choreographed or improvised, has to have certain elements to keep it from being predictable and boring.  This DVD reminds us of the importance of variation of speed and movement, and demonstrates how near stillness can work in adding to these variations, and gives simple, easy to understand examples of how to incorporate these stiller moments into performances.",1327968000,12,621,5.18
1356170,5,B00004UEEH,"Just finished watching this video and it offers a refreshing way to add some extra deliciousness to your dance!  The power of the pause within the dance is fully explained and there are lots of great drills and exercises to practice this art.  Rosa Noreen explains the concepts with such warmth, in a uniquely inviting manner throughout the DVD. It's like having a discussion with a well respected friend.  The movements used within the drilling section are basic enough for the newer dancer, yet the addition of the pauses add depth for even the more advanced dancers.  Even though the music and combinations are cabaret at the core, the concepts and exercises are useful to tribal and fusion dancers as well. I'm looking forward to incorporating the variety of pauses into my own dance to keep the audience captivated.  I highly recommend this DVD for any dancer looking to bring more depth, drama, and passion to their dance.",1327449600,16,928,4.848101265822785
1356171,2,B00004UEEH,"This is the kind of film you'd seen in a museum exhibit or waiting for a museum exhibit.  The film shows stock footage of astronauts when discussing the women who died in the Challenger.  It's a nice tribute to them, but just eats up time in a way.  The interviewer asks much about the women's life after the journey.  I would have liked to hear about life before.  All these women earned Ph. D.'s or M.D.'s in fields rarely inhabited by women.  One woman mentions cutting her hair.  I wish this were explored more because weightlessness turned most women's hair into huge mushrooms.  They almost looked like they had been electrically shocked.  Two interviewees mention osteoporosis and I would have liked to learn more if this disease hurts women's chances of going to space.  I enjoyed hearing a woman say most land on Earth is brown rather than green.  However, this work goes into scientific questions about which I could not care less.  Because a handful of African-American women and at least one Indian woman have gone to space, I was disappointed that this work only interviewed white women.  They show a photo of the Challenger astronauts and it is conspicuous how all the women are white and all the people of color are male.  This work explored the first women in space, so it might not be its fault, but little girls of color may leave uninspired by the absence of people/role models like themselves.  This work has low production values, but it's okay nonetheless.",1165622400,,1478,4.71875

Unfortunately, each episode is still edited into many segments to accommodate broadcast television commercial breaks, so that the ""In Space"" title screen annoyingly reappears at 3-minute intervals throughout each episode.  Pleasantly monotonous narrator, extremely sleepy musical track, and an impressive collection of original international space footage and video animation.
