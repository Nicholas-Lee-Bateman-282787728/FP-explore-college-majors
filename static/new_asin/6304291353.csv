853308,4,6304291353,"I first heard of this film in a preview while going to see a disney movie in the theatres.  I had looked foward to seeing it, for the preview effects were stunning.  I was dissappointed I could not find it (it never came to our theatre), however, a year or so later I found the VHS version and settled in to enjoy the film.
I was hardly disappointed.  The visual effects dazzled my eyes--it was refreshingly different from standard Disney animation.  It was wonderful to see something ""new"", though I understand the original creator took many years to compile this film.  I also love the songs--""Am I feeling love"" is especially heart rendering.  ""She is more than this"" often rings in my head, also, and I don't mind.
There were a few disappointing elements--sappy names--what king, even a sleepy, dimwitted-looking one like the king of bagdhad, would name his daughter ""Yum-Yum?""  ESPECIALLY when she was drawn dressed for the part--skimpy see-through clothes and a huge, uh, chest area?  It's a sexual reference that is a little too blatant, but the princess seemed intelligent enough, so that made up for it.
The plot could have been better woven, too.  It was choppy in some parts, boring in others--the slow talk was mind-numbing at points--but this was far overshadowed by the dazzling display of animation during the fighting scenes--the theif being flung here and there during the battle with One Eye was especially captivating.  I loved the thought-overs he had, too--the woman's scream as he came flying through her window, and coming out with a rose in his mouth and thinking ""Ohh...naughty.""  I about busted a gut.
Yes, this movie was well worth watching.  If you want to be dazzled by a truly different and unique style of animation (and are willing to overlook a few weak plot points), give this film a try.  I certainly found it worthwhile.",980121600,6,1856,4.817034700315458
853309,5,6304291353,"This is an amazing animated film!  I watched it with a bunch of eleven-year olds who are usually very blase about about the special effects in the latest movies.  They were totally captivated by this movie, and watched it twice at the first sitting.  And I enjoyed it as well!
The good news is that apparently Roy Disney has committed to restoring and issuing the original work (presumeably on DVD ?).",978912000,2,401,4.619718309859155
853310,3,6304291353,"With the announcement from Richard Williams himself that the ""work-in-progress"" version of ""The Thief and the Cobbler"" will one day be released to the public, perhaps ""The  Magnificent Ambersons"" of animation will not suffer that film's tragic  fate. Until William's work print is released, however, we have to contend  with this version.  While displaying some of William's awe-inspiring  animation (done before CGI was even heard of), the studio version is one of  the most unbearable bastardizations I've ever seen of a film. William's  groundbreaking animated work is intercut with horrid Saturday-morning  cartoon quality animation, which also contains pointless and downright  painful musical numbers. Even the footage that remains from William's  version is often marred by awful voiceovers from Jonathan Winters and  Matthew Broderick as the title characters. One bright spot in the voice  cast is the late, great Vincent Price.  While Zig-Zag might not be quite as  memorable as Ratigan, Price recites rhymes and musings with a quality that  no other actor could match. If you are looking for an example of just how  severe the damage of studio interference can be, study this film (as well  as the Criterion edition of ""Brazil""), and you will come to the  irrevocable opinion that letting executives within a mile of a single frame  of film is always a turn for the worst. I can't wait to own the REAL  version of ""The Thief and the Cobbler"" on DVD, in its restored,  widescreen, and (near) complete glory.",957398400,6,1516,5.131147540983607
853311,4,6304291353,"Despite the caustic review from Leonard Maltin above (I never buy any of his guides for this very reason - he cannot let himself see any successful scenes in anything he rates - even Star Wars, the originals, rated three  stars in his guide), I found The Thief and the Cobbler to be very  interesting and entertaining. The artwork is simply astounding in how the  shapes and colors are handled, and the script is quite funny in places,  especially the lines of the fumbling thief. The animated film features  several interesting characters, and, furthermore, the story is clean,  simple, and unspoiled by any infusion of what we think is ""right""  for films like this. The songs may not be adhere to your brains (since when  have songs begun to be requisite for animated films?), but I don't find  that distracting (quite opposite, I find catchy tunes to be the most  horrible of all...). This is a great film that has likeable heros, wily  villains, and a wonderful ending.",953337600,,973,4.732142857142857
853312,5,6304291353,"It was so refreshing to watch an animated film that was as amusing to the adults as it was to the children.  One of the elements that draws me to this film is the little jokes that the adults catch on to that the kids  don't.  Great stories reach all levels of intelligence - as this one does.  It would be really interesting, however, to see what Richard Williams would  have done with the film had he been given the chance to complete it. Still  - my two boys and I watch it over and over.  Best yet - no Happy Meal spin  off toys !!!",930787200,2,536,3.990566037735849

853314,5,6304291353,"It is not necessary to be or have kids to watch this film. While current animated features are turning towards CG to strengthen the film, ""The Thief and the Cobbler"" remains strong to the original method. The epic  spectrum and animation of the feature is something akin to Fantasia,  without the baggage that Disney films are associated with. Having renown  actors for the voices only makes this animated film that much more amazing.",920505600,2,434,4.917808219178082

I am so sorry that Williams got fired from all this. Anyway, I don't care how crappy this version is to other people, I love this movie because of the animation and some details helped me experience the movement of a young male's mouth and, yes, I am an artist who plans on becoming a storyboard artiste someday.

I know that most people don't like this version of the film (with Tack and the thief having voices and the film having songs and all), but I absolutely love this version (I have no problems with the recobbled version though). This movie does indeed have some things in common with Walt Disney's Aladdin: the main character who is not of royal blood falls in love with a princess, the visiar is the villain, the film is set in Arabia, and one of the characters (the thief) makes numerous pop culture references.

If requested, I can to get a pic of its cover on here ASAP (giving my camera USB doesn't krap out).

Getting to the disc and its specs, I thought it was going to be presented in 2.35:1 scope OAR with 5.1 EX and at least some extras. But this here IS NO BETTER THAN THE DVD!!!

854091,3,6304291353,"There's nothing I can say about the film's screwed-up history that could be said better than what has already been put here, so I want to just review the film I ordered. Overall, I did like it - interesting characters, alright story, and holy crap that chase scene between Tack and the thief was so cool. However, someone at Miramax deserves to have a steamroller drive over their genitals for some of the crap that went wrong with this film. And I am going to point those things out (warning, there will be spoilers).

1. Tack. Tack is absolutely adorable - this cute, shy little cobbler. He's also white as a sheet...how someone in a Middle Eastern country manages to be that white is a mystery all in itself, but maybe he's an albino. Who knows. My problem is with the fact that about halfway through the movie, his skin goes from ghost white to Caucasian white and then to what looks like Middle Eastern by the end of the film. Make up your mind already! Very sloppy animation work and a total lack of attention to detail to allow this to happen not once, but twice. Also, even if I had not familiarized myself with the movie's history, it's painfully obvious that Tack was meant to be a character of few words and that someone had the bright idea to give him a bunch of unnecessary lines, some of which involve him being the narrator.

2. The voices. Aside from Tack having words put in his mouth, someone also seemed to think it'd be a great idea to do this to more characters. The thief never actually opens his mouth and speaks, which means he's meant to be a silent character. Nope, Miramax decided he would communicate with us via telepathy, or as they put it, ""he's a man of few words, but many thoughts."" And the stupid jokes were unnecessary - the thief's actions spoke well enough for themselves that he did not need a voice. And why did the bird need a voice? He said nothing of importance and it's clear he was not meant to talk.

3. Animation quality. The film is like an animated quilt with random, differently designed patches spread everywhere. There's obvious vintage-looking segments, some gorgeously animated scenes, and then the half-baked crap that looks like it's from a 90s cartoon. Could they have tried a little tiny bit harder to make the animation look better? It's bad enough I have to be aurally assaulted by Matthew Broderick's voice, but some of the animation was just blah.

4. The fight scene. You hear for so long in the film about the enemy, One-Eye. OMG One-Eye is coming, One-Eye is coming, we're all gonna die and the country will explode and rain of blood and acid will fall up into the sky, hell itself will open up and billions of tortured souls will pour out and eat what remains of the earth and then the planet will explode. Okay, they don't actually say all that, but my point is everyone freaks out over this immensely-powerful enemy and then the entire army is defeated in like a minute. I can get over how the army is defeated by Tack launching one of his tacks - it's ridiculous, but I can deal with it. I would have liked to see more actual battling first, like maybe Tack gets his arse whooped a bit before he realizes what can bring the enemy down. And I would have liked to see the enemy storm the palace, or see more of that gigantic monster-machine they brought with them. It was just so pitifully short and I think if it lasted a little longer, it could have been a really epic battle scene.

Despite all that, though, I still liked the film. Obviously I think if it had been completed while adhering more to the original creator's vision, it would have been astounding. It's as if someone took a bunch of puzzles, mixed up all the pieces in a big pile, and Miramax took things that obviously did not fit and forced them into the picture so that nothing matched by the time it was finished. Would I watch it again? Honestly, yes. I don't want to judge the film solely on what it could have been and what was done well in this film is worth watching.",1329523200,,4009,4.426829268292683

I first saw this movie as a kid and it became an instant favorite of my siblings and I. It was played so much around our house we went through 3 VHS copies of it as they broke due to wear, until finally the last one ceased to work and a copy could no longer be found. At that point I didn't hear anything about the movie for years until recently hearing about it in a college film class lecture, when I heard about it's true history for the first time. Now while I would love to have seen a finished version of the original vision, I don't think it's history should detract from your enjoyment of this version. Sure it's probably a bit goofier, audience friendly and child-oriented than it was intended to be, but looking at it as a family movie I still think it's great and honestly this version will always hold a very special place in my heart.",1322697600,2,1055,4.387755102040816

The good:
This is a beautiful film to behold. The artwork and attention to detail is without comparison, and it is a charming, fun story to boot, for kids and adults. It is perhaps the last example of the golden age of hand-drawn animation and story. You will not be disappointed.

854153,4,6304291353,"I see all this raving about Richard Williams un-finished masterpiece and how this version is an abomination, well I'm here to set the record straight! Yeah Miramax cut scenes, but they were scenes that were very redundant and dragged on for way too long. This includes the destruction of the war machine that lasts about I don't know 20 minutes in the workprint. Also, major plot points aren't introduced until almost half way through, and until then you're wondering what's the point? What little story there is in this version, there is no more story in the original workprint. Miramax cut scenes to speed up the pacing. Also, originally, Tack and The Thief didn't say a word, which means over half the movie was silent! And while the Thief is still funny not talking, it makes his scenes drag on longer and it gets boring. While Jonathan Winters dialogue seems more like Rifftrax, it's funny and helps speed up the pace again! Also, how can we get invested in Tack's character if he doesn't speak? There were also no songs in the original. This is the only problem I have with Miramax's cut. But, while the songs are generic and forgettable, they're not terrible and the singing voices are at least good. So watch the ""Re-Cobbled"" cut if you wish, and while the animation and detail is brilliant, most scenes drag on for way too long and some scenes just get boring without any dialogue. But besides the added songs and dubbed dialogue, this version isn't that different from Wiliams workprint. This just speeds up pace and adds a little more humor.",1306108800,4,1552,4.709558823529412

Most of the main characters aren't supposed to talk during almost the whole movie. And the thief's constant internal dialog mouthed by Jonathan Winters is grating beyond belief. The musical numbers are cringe-worthy garbage. Whole scenes are taken out, and filler is put in.
Until someone restores the original, the only reason to buy this movie is to look at the amazing art and animation. Supremely rich, novel and detailed backgrounds.
This movie looks like it's all over the place... garbage in some sections, genius in others. Once you know the history, it all makes sense and it becomes easier to dismiss what was tacked on.",1270425600,,757,4.921875
854228,4,6304291353,"Originally released in U.S. theatres as Arabian Night, and also known in other parts of the world as The Princess And The Cobbler, this movie was actually in production for nearly thirty years. First spearheaded in the 60s by Richard Williams who was the animation director for Who Framed Roger Rabbit and the Raggedy Ann & Andy movie, The Thief And The Cobbler went from one production period to another. It was first going to be finally be released in the early 90s by Warner Bros., but that deal fell through when it wasn't done on time. So Williams did two versions of this, one in America as Arabian Night through Miramax, and as Princess And The Cobbler as another, each edit is supposed to be radically different from the other.

Set during the time of the Arabian Nights, an army of evil warriors called the One-Eyes(because they all have one of their eyes poked out)is making their way to Bagdad which is also referred to as the Golden City. Living there is a simpler cobbler named Tack, who after encountering the unnamed Thief in his shop stumbles into the grand vizir, Zigzag(voiced by the late Vincent Price, which was his last movie role). Ziggy brings him to the king to be executed, but the luscious Princess Yum-Yum takes a serious shining to him, and saves him by claiming she needs a shoe repaired. Meanwhile, the Thief sneaks into the palace to try and steal three gold balls that are placed on top of a high tower which are prophecised to protect the city from evil. Tack runs into ZZ again and has him put in prision. Thief manages after several Wile E. Coyote-type attempts to finally get the balls, just as a messenger comes to inform the king of the oncoming One-Eyes invasion. When Zigzag's posse gets the balls for him after the Thief drops them, he uses this as a chance to have the king let him marry the princess. After being rejected, Zigster takes the balls to ally himself with the One-Eyes. Yum-Yum then goes with Tack on a quest to get advice from a reclusive witch who lives in the desert to find out how to stop the One-Eyes, al while being followed by the Thief. Along the way, they run across some melodic desert punks who were formally with the army, that Yummy adopts as her royal guard. They get to the witch who tells them to attack the One-Eyes when they come. Double-backing it to Bagdad, they arrive just as the One-Eyes unleash their gigantic war machine on the city. Tack realizes that the witch ment to use ""a tack"" though, and throws a tack at the soldiers which ricochets off several soldiers and eventually causes the war machine to fall apart, although the Thief's attempts to get the balls back from it help bring it down too. Tack is seen as a hero, marries Yum-Yum, and the Thief tries to make off with the closing credits.

This film has some serious design clashes in it, but in a good way. It goes the way of generic Disney style, but is more heavily based on the United Productions of America animation who did Mr. Magoo. The main draw was the esthetic use of perspective involved in some of the shots to provide an almost 3-D effect when watching it. When Disney more or less took the film from Richard Williams when they released it through Miramax, they gave it a new edit and some new voice overs. They added Johnathon Winters as the Thief(in inner monologue only), and Matthew Broderick as Tack, even though in the original dub he was voiced by Sean Connery. After lots of ups & downs with Disney, Williams finally decided to release it as a non-profit bootleg titled The Recobbled Cut.

Not for the people that stole the film from Williams and what they made of it, but what Williams would have wanted it to be. hell, maybe if we give this version a bit of credit it would convince Disney to refurbish it.

All in all, this film should not be forgotten just because a bunch of bigwig hollywood fools decided to ruin it for everyone. Recognise The Thief and the Cobbler for what it is; an absolute gem of an animation, and one that fully deserves our respect.",1184112000,6,968,4.372222222222222
854324,3,6304291353,"Like ""The Magnificent Ambersons"" or ""Superman II"", ""The Thief and the Cobbler"" is the ruin of a masterpiece.  Richard Williams' intricately animated film was butchered by the studio, and the two title characters, both intended to be largely mute roles, had nearly non-stop dialogue dubbed onto their every scene (Tack, the cobbler, actually becomes the narrator of the movie!).

The plot of ""The Thief and the Cobbler"" -- an original story, not an adaptation of a traditional tale or literary work -- has sometimes been criticized as dull and unmemorable.  I agree with this assessment; Williams' statement during the film's production that it would be the first animated feature whose plot would tie together like a detective story at the end seems wildly off-base, and more applicable to ""The Lion King"" than ""The Thief and the Cobbler"".  Nonetheless, enough of Williams' achievement can be glimpsed in the released film to convince me that the plot would have served well enough as a vehicle for the fantastic animation had the film been completed as Williams intended.

It is indeed to be hoped that an official restoration and rerelease of this film are soon undertaken.  Until then, the current (pan-and-scan) DVD is worth a rental, but not a purchase.",1180483200,4,1258,5.053140096618358
854325,2,6304291353,"Richard Williams' legendary labour of love The Thief and the Cobbler is one of those films that was just born unlucky. After spending three decades working on it, the animator over-ran the budget and was taken off his own picture, with the gaps filled in by cheap Thai and Hungarian animation that sticks out like a sore thumb, many of the original voice cast (Anthony Quayle, Donald Pleasance, Felix Aylmer, Sean Connery) redubbed, musical numbers added and the film retitled The Princess and the Cobbler in a version that only seems to have ever been released in Australia (sadly, the Australian DVD is panned and scanned from the original Scope ratio, as is this release). Then, to add insult to injury, Miramax re-edited that version even further from Williams' intentions and retitled it Arabian Knight to cash-in on the success of Aladdin, leading to a film intentionally designed as anti-Disney animation being marketed as the very thing its creator was rebelling against.

The Miramax cut presented here is quite painful to watch at times, not least because of the horrendous non-stop stream of subconciousness mutterings from Jonathan Winters dubbed over the silent character of the Thief, best described as the cinematic equivalent of sitting next to a loquacious drunk with exceptionally bad breath on the last bus home. At one point Roy Disney tried to restore the film to its original conception, seeking out the lost and unused sequences and talking about getting Williams to finish the film his way - only for the Disney-Eisner feud to see the film's champion leave the company and the film in the Weinstein's tender mercies.

The film would never have been a masterpiece: for all it's visual audacity there never seems to have been enough of a story. Williams was clearly more interested in animating increasingly elaborate and intricate sequences involving the Thief than in filling out the plot points, but what's especially astonishing is that in an incredible act of cinematic vandalism many of the most visually inventive parts of the film hit the cutting room floor even though whole sequences had been completed - indeed, even much of the truly extraordinary work in the climactic destruction of the war machine has been cut. While some of these scenes were relegated to the end credits sequence, in some cases their omissions leads to massive continuity problems and gaps in the plot. To make matters worse, the original footage seems to have disappeared, preventing its partial restoration. Still, I suppose we should be grateful (though surprised would be a more appropriate reaction) that they didn't replace Vincent Price's voice as well.

There are surviving moments of visual genius, particularly a brief but amazing chase sequence across chequered and patterned floors and backgrounds that is all the more impressive for being entirely hand-drawn (Williams started work in 1968 long before computer animation was even a glimmer on the far horizon), but they're never enough to compensate for the fact that you don't really care about the characters or the story around them. The Cobbler in particular is a bland and uninteresting character, all the more so for being mute (or at least in the original version until the last line of the film, originally delivered rather clumsily by Sean Connery, though both released versions gave him voice-over dialog - in this Miramax cut the Cobbler is voiced by Matthew Broderick). The work print, filled out with storyboards and pencil tests, gives some impression of what has been lost and how much better this could have been, though that is not included on this disc (widely circulated at conventions, it would at least been a gesture to animation fans to include it regardless of its poor quality). But whichever version you see you'll be left with a film that frustrates and astounds to varying degrees.

Sadly, while they have reverted to Williams' title, Miramax's DVD is exactly the same `Arabian Knight' cut with no restored footage or extras. In fact, it manages to be even more disappointing than their laser disc release - while that at least was in 2.35:1 widescreen, this every-effort-spared barebones release doesn't even have a widescreen transfer. Shameful.",1172707200,10,4244,5.084648493543759

854327,5,6304291353,"NOTE: THIS REVIEW APPLIES ONLY TO THE ORIGINAL RICHARD WILLIAMS WORKPRINT CUT, NOT THE VERSION ON DVD OR RELEASED INTO THEATERS

In possibly the worst seizures of a film in history, possibly the greatest animated film was reduced to a grotesque mess only with only hints of the original brilliance. Almost half of the film was deleted or never finished, wonderful vocal performances were re-dubbed, and extensive re-editing destroyed the lyrical narrative form.

Before The Thief and the Cobbler was ripped to shreds, it was a pet project of animator/director Richard Williams (who you should know as the animation director... or really co-director of Who Framed Roger Rabbit). From 1964 to the late 1980s, every penny spent on the film was out of his own pocket or from small investments from benefactors. He produced hundreds of television commercials to pay for the movie. Alas, even after years of work, he had only about 10 minutes of footage at the cost of $2 million dollars.

The Thief and the Cobbler started as an adaptation of stories about Mulla Nasrudin (by Idres Shah). When rights over the published work fell apart, he turned his project into an original, but familiar tale. The haunting opening narration (spoken by Shakespearian actor Sir Felix Almyer) began the film:

""It is written among the limitless constellations of the celestial heavens and in the depths of the emerald seas and upon every grain of sand in the vast deserts that the world which we see is an outward and visible dream of an inward and invisible reality.

Once upon a time there was a golden city. In the centre of the golden city atop the tallest minaret were three golden balls. The ancients had prophesied that if the three golden balls were ever taken away harmony would yield to discord and the city would fall to destruction and death.

But... the mystics had also foretold that the city might be saved by the simplest soul with the smallest and simplest of things.

In the city there dwelt a lowly shoemaker... who was known as Tack the Cobbler. Also in the city... existed a Thief... who shall be nameless.""

Through a series of circumstances, the flea-bitten thief causes Tack to be mistaken as an attacker on the Grand Vizier Zig-Zag. After being brought to the palace to be executed, he falls in love with Princess Yum-Yum (daughter of the benevolent, but sleepy King Nod). Zig-Zag bribes and brownnoses King Nod, hoping to control the Golden City and take Yum-Yum as his own.

Tack is a white-faced and silent - his demeanor and movement reminiscent of Chaplin's Tramp, Harry Langdon, and Jacques Tati's Hulot. The Thief is a scrawny, flea-bitten kleptomaniac mute. Zig-Zag, voiced by Vincent Price in a valedictorian performance, is blue-skinned and vulture-like in appearance.

Princess Yum-Yum is voiced by Hilary Pritchard (bit player in many 1970's British TV shows), King Nod by Sir Anthony Quayle, Zig-Zag's vulture has squawks and hisses provided by Donald Pleasence. In a surprise, but appropriate cameo, Sir Sean Connery provides his voice.

For animation, he recruited master animators from the golden age: Art Babbitt (Disney), Ken Harris (Warner Bros.), Myron ""Grim"" Natwick (Fleischers). He would also give shots to his commercial animators to work on as training (many of which went on to be acclaimed animators in their own right such as Eric Goldberg, Tom Sito, and his son Alex). Richard Williams, himself, animated much of the film himself - often keeping Zig-Zag's scenes to himself. The style of most of the characters is a blend of the rounded UPA look, but with the detail of Disney. Rare for most animated films, nearly all of the animation was drawn in ""ones"" which refers to one drawing = one frame.

The film's plot is intricately subtle, requiring the utmost attention to detail to understand the characters. Being that the two main characters have no dialogue, emotions are conveyed masterfully through facial expressions and gestures. Sometimes, just one brief shot defines an entire character. The animation itself (in the original 70 minutes directed by Richard Williams) out-performs 3-D digital animation. Characters are drawn with such fluidity, often giving the illusion of being live-action (make no mistake, not one frame utilized rotoscoping). However, the film often replicates the look of a live-action film. Surprisingly, the fluid ""camera movement"" is similar to the styles used in the French New Wave - length dolly shots, long takes, 360 degree turns, and even rapid zooms. In one bravura shot, the camera dollys from a close-up of Zig-Zag's eyes with full 3-D perspective and then revealed to be a reflection in another character's eye - continuing to pull out.

It's important to note that everything in the film was as intricate as possible. As mentioned before, the most subtle emotions conveyed by characters say more than dialogue. Tack's facial emotion is hidden by his pale face, but the one or two tacks held in his lips become his smile or frown. Zig-Zag is drawn with extra shoulder joints like a marionette. His face is virtually a characture of Vincent Price (appropriately). If that's not enough, Zig-Zag has six digits on each hand, each with an extra joint, and 20 rings per hand. The Thief conveys his want (whether it be the golden balls or jewels) through a reflection in his eyes. Desert brigands are literally animated sketches (in contrast to the highly refined main characters). The settings are drawn with squashed perspective as a homage to Persian miniatures paintings.

The story itself combines comedy, romance, fantasy, with a little bit of scares. The One-Eye Army is reminiscent of the Teutonic soldiers in Alexander Nevsky - led by the massive Mighty One-Eye. The Thief constantly gets into injury or mishaps as if he were a human Wile E. Coyote (not a coincidence since Ken Harris, the main animator for the thief, often animated the classic Roadrunner cartoons). Tack is constantly at work - sometimes repairing shoes in his sleep.

The centerpiece of the film, though, is the gigantic One-Eye Army War Machine. Filled with Rube Goldberg mousetrap devices. The destruction sets off a chain reaction, resulting in self-destruction.

Featuring beautiful and stunning animation, wonderful vocal performances, and plenty of laughs - The Thief and the Cobbler almost had a chance at being the greatest animated film ever made.

After decades of work, with only 15 minutes of animation to complete in 4 months, the investors pulled out of a negative pickup deal, resulting in the incomplete film to be bought-out by the Completion Bond Company. Richard Williams was taken off his own project. Incomplete animation was farmed out to Korea where it was finished poorly (even compared to the original work). Many voices were re-dubbed, including Sir Anthony Quayle's wonderful King Nod. Insipid musical sequences were added. Over 20 minutes of completed animation were cut out of the film. Tack was given a new voice regardless of his lips moving or not. Originally with an eclectic soundtrack consisting of classical (much from Rimsky-Korsakov's Scheherazade), surreal Wendy Carlos-eque electronic pieces, and even some fierce jazzy sections - it was replaced with a mediocre orchestral score that borrowed heavily from Henry Mancini's themes for The Pink Panther.

While the original story remained intact to an extent, many inexplicable changes were made. Tack, shown to be quite a successful cobbler, was changed via a new opening narration to be an orphan and shoemaker's apprentice. Yum-Yum was changed into a feminist. Originally with a modulated, demonic voice, Mighty One-Eye was redubbed with a laughably tame voice.

The misery did not end there. Miramax picked up distribution for the United States and altered the film even further. The first release was retitled The Princess and the Cobbler. This new version, Arabian Knight made even worse changes. The Thief, thankfully left as a mute in the prior version, was given a voice provided by Jonathan Winters - who seemed to ad-lib the entire performance. Phido, Zig-Zag's vulture, was given a voice even with absolutely no lip-sync. Tack and Yum-Yum were redubbed again, often with the ADR out of sync. Even more footage was deleted such as an entire subplot with the Mad Holy Old Witch (voiced by Carry On ____ regular Joan Sims) and much of the fantastic War Machine sequence. Even worse, this further altered version was marketed as an Aladdin clone - to the point of having overdubs referencing the film.

Even in its truncated and emasculated form, the genius of the original animation is stunning. Negotiations have been off and on since the release of the altered cuts to restore it. The Walt Disney Company currently owns the film and has the power to bring back Richard Williams to allow him to restore and finish the film the way it was intended to be seen.

Until this happens, the only way to see the original film is via VHS tape bootlegs - often from 3rd generation sources. Considering how much a fanbase exists thanks to the bootleg, it would be benificial to Disney and fans for the uncut version to finally be made available not only on DVD, but to be allowed a wide theatrical release. Thanks to the rules of the Academy Award, a theatrical release of a restoration would allow it to win the Best Animated Feature Oscar - among others.

Until then, avoid the current DVD like the plague. The Thief and the Cobbler is one of the rare cel-animated films shot in CinemaScope - at the time of the film's production starting, only two American films shot in wide-format had been made (Disney's The Lady and the Tramp and Sleeping Beauty). The commercial DVD is in pan & scan, which does unforgivable damage to the virtuoso 2.35:1 framing the film had - even the laserdisc preserved this.",1146787200,115,9837,4.98901769371568

854330,1,6304291353,"It's almost been a full year since I developed interest in this film. I remember reading that Richard Williams himself announced in 2000 at one of his Master classes that the workprint version of The Thief and the Cobbler will be released on DVD. This is contrary to what he promised. It all turns out to be the infamous heavily butchered version from those scissor-happy morons at Miramax! It's almost been 10 years since it was released under the name, Arabian Knight, 3 years after it was disowned from Richard. They first released the DVD a few years ago on boxes of Froot Loops, and only in Canada(how's THAT for insulting?), But this has gone far enough!! I gave this DVD only 1 star, because I want to let you know what a mockery they've made of what would've been the greatest animated film of all time. They've done a lousy job on Special Features. There's only English and French audio, scene selections, and it's only in fullscreen, which subtracts much from the original film. Don't buy this! Instead, spread the word about the film's troubled history and demise, the websites I strongly recommend are:

[...]
(This site will tell you everything you need to know about the film. It has, pics, clips from the workprint, articles about the film's history, and a ""Help Save It!"" part with addresses to write to Disney and Miramax to help inspire releasing the workpint to the public. Believe me, when you read the articles of the film, you'd be outraged. Strongly Recommended site.)

(A small art page dedicated to helping spreading the word on the film in the way it was meant to be. I wasn't a member of the site, but I've contributed a lot of info to the owner, including the original narration to the workprint's opening.)

[...]
(An online petition to help release the Workprint version on DVD Uncut and Unedited, Also strongly recommended.)

Also, if Disney and/or Miramax are reading this, if you ever get around restoring the film, I have some Requests for The Thief and the Cobbler: Workprint version: Special Collector's Edition  DVD Extras:
* A very special introduction to the DVD, hopefully by Richard Williams himself(He can host other parts of the DVD. Roy E. Disney can appear too, but it should be Williams).

* The Whole Movie Uncut and Unedited (an obvious one).

* In Widescreen (also obvious)

* Fully Digitally Restored and Remastered footage and Audio (also obvious, especially the samples of ""Scheherazade"" by Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov from the workprint).

* A very Special Audio Commentary by Richard Williams or his son, Alex Williams, whichever one's available.(Preferably Richard. He'll pour his heart out the most in the commentary).

* English, Spanish, and French Captions and Subtitles.

* Early and rare Artwork, drawings, and pencils tests.

* All the documentaries documenting the film's progress, courtesy of the BBC.

* An all-new exclusive documentary on the film, its troubled history, and its demise, featuring fans, animators, animation/film historians, family, friends and people who ever worked with Richard, and also featuring clips of his other work in it.

* Richard's commercials and other short films, The Little Island; Love Me, Love Me, Love Me, etc. Courtesy of him.

* A small acknowledgment to those loyal and determined fans who pitched in to make this DVD possible.

 And there better be at least 11 of those features on that DVD(that would be all of them, if you've counted, correctly).The DVD can be a limited series like the Walt Disney Treasures, but you should make widespread copies for everyone's access. You can do either one, as long as it's how Richard Williams intended it. We want this to be one heck of a DVD, with the same care and top notch quality as Miyazaki's films, and other features to make this DVD worthy of the name,""Special Collectors's Edition"". The Australians (who have The Princess and the Cobbler) deserve this DVD, too. Maybe a limited theatrical release across American cinemas and IMAX theatres wouldn't be bad either. It's all part of the plan of releasing the workprint to the public, isn't it? Richard and his associates MUST be round the restoration project at all times, and let him design the poster/DVD cover.

It's up to us to help convince Disney/Miramax to make Richard's dream come true, even if it's going to be risky and expensive. And I don't care how relations between the 2 companies are, there's a vision to be restored, and they need to do it, now!

854388,2,6304291353,"As an avid fan of animation, it always puzzles me that a good number of DVD editions of animated films do not offer a letterboxing option. I know that many arguments will state that pan and scan formats are more family friendly. However, so much can be lost when animated films are edited to fit a TV screen. Theif and the Cobbler suffers greatly because of it. The story itself is pretty average and the music is pretty mediocre too. It's only saving grace is some of the intricate animated in this film. I can remember seeing a trailer for this film in theatres and it blew me away. The artistry in the sequences that were shown was amazing. When you cut the scope of the picture in half you are left with only a taste of what this film was.

  The DVD edition has precious little to offer and for what you are paying for you are not getting your money's worth. For the $29 list price, some extras and both versions of the film would have been more appropriate.

854389,3,6304291353,"This movie is almost impossible to evaluate.  The history of its shoddy treatment by the marketing geniuses at Warner Bros, Miramax, and others is well known by animation aficionados and it doesn't look like the situation is going to be remedied any time soon so all we have - in the United States, at least - is this DVD.

My 3-star rating is as high as it is because what leaks through of Richard Williams' original intentions are truly breathtaking.  The MC Escher-inspired chase through the palace is eye-popping, not to mention brain-scrambling;  there are parts of this that you have to run back and watch again to accurately interpret what you're seeing, such is the extent that Williams monkeys around with the traditional visual expectations of animation and even pen and ink drawing itself.  The character design that shows through all the meddling is unmatched - especially Zig Zag, the Vincent Price-voiced character.

Unfortunately, alongside all this stunning work sits a bunch of stuff that wouldn't look out of place on an old Scooby Doo cartoon.  The song sections are the worst offenders, in my opinion.  It also looks like the people who rushed the film to completion were TERRIFIED of letting anyone on screen shut the hell up for a moment.  There's ALWAYS someone yapping and that more than anything else makes this version of ""The Thief and the Cobbler"" REALLY annoying to watch.  Someone obviously had no opinion of the target audiences' intelligence because Matthew Broderick's character repeats plot information that we've just seen endlessly - on some occasions making nonsense of what has come before.

Anyone curious about the full story behind this film should check out Eddie Bowers' ""Thief and the Cobbler"" page - do a Google search for ""thief and the cobbler"" and it should come up right away.  Interesting and very sad story.",1110499200,3,1858,4.958064516129032
854390,1,6304291353,"I am not here to rant about how what this movie became after Miramax/Disney got a hold of it back in the mid 90's. However, I am here to expound my extreme irritation with this shoddy release.

A little history first: A fullscreen, 2 channel version of this movie on DVD was offered as a free promotional item on cereal boxes in Canada about 5 years ago.  I picked one up at that time for a few bucks on an auction site.  I still have the cereal box version in my collection, holding out for a Widescreen release, similar to the one that I first saw on Laserdisc.  So at long last Disney releases it on DVD and it is the same exact thing that was offered on the cereal box, but now it is the price you see here - ouch!  Actually, I found it a local ***-Mart store for half as much, so shame on this place for their price gouging.

This is a clear case of Disney not knowing their audience.  It appears family movies are more marketable in fullscreen, even though most buyers of this video are going to be animation fans, original content changes notwithstanding.  Disney should have taken the same angle with this one that they took with the excellent Studio Ghibli releases.  But the man behind that brilliant maneuver, John Lasseter at Pixar, probably has shaky relations with Disney at this point.  So this half-baked release will sit on the shelf next to another crappy Disney release, Mulan II, and gather dust.

So Disney sees it as disposable, as far as I am concerned and I don't expect to see it released anytime soon.  We originally saw this in Laser Disc format and we have loved it ever since, and I miss that widescreen version.  Vincent Price's voice as a baddie is perfect, as always.
