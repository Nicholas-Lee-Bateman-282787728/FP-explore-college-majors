1084590,5,6305812306,Love Field was a lovely movie.  Michelle Pheiffer and Dennis Haysbert were excellent.  I would recommend this movie to all my friends and family.,1175472000,,145,5.0
1084591,5,6305812306,"Call me sentimental, I don't care, but I loved this film. Although it deals with America's cancer - racism- as well as any I can recall, it does so in a way that should touch the human in any civilized human.  There have been hundreds of films with racism at their heart, PINKY, THE DEFIANT ONES, THE COLOR PURPLE, MISSISSIPPI BURNING, THE SEARCHERS etc, etc but LOVE FIELD is up with the best and this is due mainly to the masterly direction of Mr Kaplan.  But to cite racism as its raison d'etre is to miss the fact that it has a compelling narrative, the story of a journey - on a bus, in a series of vintage sixties automobiles which cruise through the poverty stricken back counties of the black South, and on foot - and an internal journey in the heart and mind of its three main characters, a black man, and his five year old daughter, and a VERY white white woman. There are at least two laugh out loud moments one featuring the gorgeous Ms Pfeiffer who, when caught short in the countryside, is about to defecate on a map of Virginia when she realises they are very near the goal of HER journey, Arlington Cemetery and JFK's funeral, and she stumbles up shouting with her knickers literally in a twist around her ankles. Unless you have a heart of stone, you will also shed some tears over this film - for its characters, for good American people, for the hopes of a potentially great country, and the failure of the American dream. The huge cars symbolise so  much - and when our heroes drive off in one, it clunks along at no more than 40 because it is damaged goods, just as the society is which judges and weighs worth on the basis of  colour.  To me this is Ms Pfeiffer's greatest role and one of the finest I have seen of an American actor.  Mr Haysbert is brilliant. A great American film. Call me sentimental, but I loved it!",1126310400,18,1842,4.3246376811594205
1084592,5,6305812306,"I will always wonder why this movie did not get the attention it deserved. Perhaps people still shy away from the racial issue. Whatever the answer may be, it is a terrible pity, since it was probably Michelle Pfeiffers best performance ever.
Moreover this movie, centred around the growing affection between two people from different cultural and racial background brings the racial isssue closer to the public then any other movie I have ever seen.
Excellent acting, a good script and the controversial subject treated with a sublety that in no way distracts from its importance make this the top movie in it's genre",1003276800,10,618,4.951923076923077
1084593,5,6305812306,"Hollywood wouldn't know a great character driven movie/script if it hit them with a MACK truck,this film should have received much more attention. Michelle Pfeiffer should have won the Oscar for her role and talent breathing life into the child like naive Texan, Lurene. The ""very blond"" hairdresser from Dallas deals with her reality by viewing her life through the eyes of Jackie Kennedy. Even down to owning the clothing patterns for Jackie's wardrobe and dealing with her own life's regrets through Jackie's eyes, it is destiny that she attend the President's funeral to give support to Jackie. On her journey she encounters a black man with his own regrets and problems, along with his young daughter Jonell, ""Joan Ellen"". As their paths meet, so do a variety of crisis that brings their point of views together. Racial observers looking at Lurene and Paul funny because of their acquaintace with each other, but the childlike Lurene doesn't understand why. This is definately a treat to watch, and as a native Dallas/Fort Worth Texan, I vow that Michelle nailed the character Lurene as very believeable, from the accent to her viewpoint as a Texan in the 60's...with a special touch of course. Treat yourself and watch this movie!",996019200,28,1236,4.975845410628019
1084594,5,6305812306,"I can't begin to understand why this film was ignored by audiences everywhere, but I am glad I had the opportunity to watch this film.  Love Field is about a woman obsessed with Jackie Kennedy and she has to meet her when she and JFK arrive at the Dallas airport.  Later on in the picture, Michelle Pfeiffer's character leaves her husband and on the way meets a father and his daughter and befriends them.  It may seem like a 'simple' movie, but Love Field is a touching film worth your time.",983318400,12,492,4.384615384615385

She received the Academy Award Nomination for it.  This was a movie she did after playing the iconic Catwoman in Batman Returns, so it's interesting to see how vastly different the performances and films are from each for that matter.",1459123200,,412,5.196969696969697
1084687,3,6305812306,Surprisingly good. Pfeiffer was delightful. The story was a stretch but still entertaining. As a Southernor I do tire of being typecast as ignorant and racist. There are more stories to tell about the south.,1444176000,,207,4.942857142857143

she's made is ""I am Sam""  ---a wonderful actress who is highly underrated

1084736,3,6305812306,"I want to say that I had no idea what this movie was about when I started watching it.  I knew that it starred Michelle Pfeiffer and that it was called `Love Field' and despite living in Dallas I didn't make that connection and instead thought this was some period piece interracial love story movie.  It is, sort of, but not in the sense of what I was envisioning.

`Love Field' tells the story of unstable housewife Lurene Hallett who is a tad simple minded, married to a man who puts up with her more than loves her and has a strange connection to Jackie Kennedy.  In fact, in the film's opening scenes we see her bounded to touch the skin of the woman and then completely crushed when her moment passes.  After the president is murdered, Lurene is intent on supporting Jackie O. at the funeral, but her husband opposes (I mean, he's being sensible but we're beyond that point by now) and so she defies him and runs off.  On her bus en-route to northern states she meets a mysterious black man named Paul who is traveling with his daughter.  Due to her own meddling and misunderstanding, she is soon on the run with this man and his child as they are being tracked down by police and by Lurene's husband.  Due to the nature of the south, there isn't much sympathy for a crazed white woman in the company of a black man, but Lurene doesn't understand all that.  In her mind, everything is fine.

`Love Field' touches on some very controversial history, with regard to racism in particular, but I felt as if the depiction of Lurene was a little too gimmicky.  The script basically used her to make a point, and by doing that they made her less of a character and more of a symbol, which didn't always work to the advantage of the film.  Still, Pfeiffer is really good here and Dennis Haysbert is excellent (when is he not?) and so it is worth seeing for the two of them.  It's predictable and a little too obvious in parts, but it is engaging enough to be worthy of a gander.",1360800000,4,1976,4.35149863760218
1084737,5,6305812306,I love this movie. I don't know why it didn't make it big in the theaters. Michelle Pfiffer did an excellent jpb. The movie came very quickly after being ordered. Thank you!,1356220800,,173,4.4375
1084738,4,6305812306,"With everyone seeming to review only Pfeiffer's performance . . . did no one understand Dennis Haybert's role?  I read in the gossip columns of the day that there was no love lost between the two off screen, but Haysbert did a marvellous job if this is fact. The simple act of his embrace after release from prison: a smothered chuckle at voicing her dislike of the word divorcee, accompanied by the subtle inhalation of her hair/perfume made me tear.  Why don't people notice these small but human interpretations?
Dennis Haysbert has indeed trudged a long way to stardom, whilst Michelle, although an excellent actress, has had only to slightly lower her lashes for a wonderful photograph!
I am not African-American, nor even American by birth.  No invert or overt racism here!  I simply believe Dennis Haysbert's performance was totally overlooked in this film.",1235260800,7,864,4.979166666666667
1084739,4,6305812306,"I'd never heard of this film but pulled it off the library shelf, not expecting much.  I liked it from the beginning, due to the wonderful performance of Michelle Pfeiffer, as Lurene, a ditzy Texas blond in the 60's.  She worships the Kennedys, has a scrapbook of their photos, and makes clothes after the patterns that Jackie wears.  She'd seem silly except that she has a heart of gold and is very likeable.

She is, of course, crushed when JFK is killed while visiting Dallas, her home, and decides to override the objections of her redneck husband and takes the Greyhound to DC to attend the funeral.  On the bus she encounters a quiet Black man, beautifully played by Dennis Haysbert, who's travelling with a small girl who doesn't speak.  Lurene isn't shy and she intrudes herself into the lives of these two, in spite of the efforts of the Black man to keep her out.

What follows is a surprising series of events that keep the three entertwined, in spite of racial prejudice, the FBI and Lurene's husband.

It's a relatively simple film but the story is good and all of the performances are excellent.  Maybe it wasn't arty enough to impress folks at the time, but I found it to be a charming, heartfelt film, certainly worth watching.",1232409600,2,1243,4.613636363636363

7896741,5,6305812306,"This one took a few hours to resonate with me so here goes.  I hate spoilers so I'm going to be real careful to avoid them.  This one could have gone either way.  This is real tricky material and in the wrong hands it could have gone awry.  Fortunately that's not the case.  Setting a potential interracial romance during the days of a national tragedy could have come off as mawkish and I daresay melodramatic.  This one had the makings of a Douglas Sirk weepie and I love Douglas Sirk.  We're in good hands so they managed to pull it off.  Michelle Pfeiffer deservedly received an Oscar nomination as the grieving Dallas beautician shouldering a recent miscarriage.  Dennis Haysbert equals her as an educated African-American father trying to protect his five year old daughter in a nation roiling in irrational prejudice.  The chemistry between Pfeiffer and Haysbert is real and palpable.  Director Jonathan Kaplan intuitively recognizes the sensitivity of the subject matter he's handling and keeps the proceedings compelling and heartfelt.  This film had the misfortune of being made in 1991 when its studio, Orion Pictures, declared Chapter 11 bankruptcy.  It sat on the shelf for a few years and given a perfunctory release.  I don't know if that long gestation period caused it to barely a ripple at the box office.  Regardless, it's a wonderfully poignant film that deserves recognition.",1518307200,,1396,4.982683982683983
