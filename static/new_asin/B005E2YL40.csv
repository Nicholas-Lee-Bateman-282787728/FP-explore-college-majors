4663442,3,B005E2YL40,"DBZ in BluRay, whats left to say really... Everyone knows and loves DBZ by now, there have been so many different releases over the years, from the Pioneer home video days (oh yeah, I'm OG DBZ), to the early Funimation VHS 4 episode tapes, then the DVD 4 episode releases, next the Funimation DVD sets, the Dragon Box's, the Bastardized DBZ Kai, and now Blu-Ray... and that's just the American releases... my point is, everyone has seen the show, so its nothing new. The Blu-Ray has the expected higher picture and sound quality, just like any other movie/series that gets a BluRay, so that is nothing new either.

My first complaint is when they were going through frame by frame, once again, they could have changed the aspect ratio to 16:9... there is nothing worsr than watching something on a 50"" screen and having those giant black bars on the side... They did it for gunslinger girl, and many other titles, why not DBZ?? seriously get with the times... if you really want to watch something in the same format it was originally made, go find the old DBZ VHS tapes and dust or your old VCR!

My second complaint is, they are seriously milking the releases. An anime ""season"" on 4 Blu-Rays over two releases, and on top of that they are not even the complete sagas (the entire sayan saga is not on ""season 1"" it spreads to ""season 2""). They should have stuck to the saga sets, instead of making the series to fit into seasons, and then not have the entire story line in the season, forcing you to buy the next release over and over again.  What was wrong with having saga sets?

Seriously though, a 4:3 aspect ratio Blu-Ray is an oxymoron!",1331337600,,1644,4.506711409395973
4663443,5,B005E2YL40,"DBZ IS AWESOME! The only thing i didn't like is that the quality was kind of grainy. I expected crystal clear. Its better than the dvds, but its a little grainy, I did use a 1080p bluray (phillips) player with 1080p/120htz(sony) tv and cables. I likeD it, cant wait for the other ones to be released!!!",1330473600,,302,4.410714285714286
4663444,5,B005E2YL40,"The main reason i held from buying for this long was because the price dropped a little..Funimation did better than i thought,hopefully they can find a way to continue the level sets without compromising the picture quality.",1328832000,6,224,5.081081081081081
4663445,5,B005E2YL40,"I originally thought Funimation was milking the series with the blu ray editions, especially when I found out there were so few episodes per set.  I bought the first one just for the heck of it, and was amazed at the difference between it and all the previous releases.
The reason there are so few episodes is most likely due to all the work that has to be put to restore each episode.  Funimation finally took the right steps that all DBZ fans should praise.  Even if it takes a couple years to finish (as this very well might) I hope they follow through and persevere despite the declining anime market.  The aspect ratio, colors, and details are all finally perfect, leaving us with a picture that I can't imagine to be any better.",1326240000,12,734,4.455223880597015
4663446,5,B005E2YL40,"Dragon Ball Z fans are lucky in the fact that the series has been put on a variety of home video options. Many animes only get periodic releases and are thus hard to find (like Death Note). Many don't even have Blu-Ray editions. Well, Funimation is now putting out the DBZ series on Blu-Ray. The HD quality is stunning and fans will be pleased to note original aspect ratio and color scheme. If you have not invested in the Dragon Boxes then these are the clear route to go to own DBZ. The Dragon Boxes (as of this writing) are becoming harder to find and more expensive. The quality of the Dragon Box picture is very good, however, it is no match for what you will find on these sets. The major drawback is that these sets do not have a hardcover book or neat slipcase akin to the Dragon Boxes. Nope, these are just two disc Blu-Ray sets. Each set holds 17 episodes and if Funimation keeps to that pattern then there should be 17 releases (some sets will probably have a couple more or less episodes). The next editions (2.1 and 2.2) are slated for a March release. Yes, Funimation is milking it but the fans are getting a superior product compared to prior releases.",1325462400,4,1168,4.387096774193548
4663447,5,B005E2YL40,"I'm still very pleased that Funimation will be releasing this DBZ set in Blu-ray. I don't know for sure if I'll get level 1.1 or not. I plan on getting 1.2 because thats when the saiyans arrive on earth and it has one of the best fights in the show. I hope the price of this goes down over time. Later on, they'll probably have a season set for 1.1 and 1.2. I highly recommend this to any DBZ fan.

Update: The price of the set finally went down.",1318377600,2,446,4.01123595505618
4663448,5,B005E2YL40,I am very excited to see this.  i have been waiting forever to see this.  i love the series so even thou Kai just came out I will totally buy these just so when I want to see the original I have it in all its glory.  I know a lot of people say Kai is the same but they did change a few things around in it compared to the first.  So I am definitely scooping these up as well when it comes out. :),1315699200,4,396,3.5697674418604652

4663450,5,B005E2YL40,"Only way to watch DBZ.  What are they doing, not putting out 2.1?? Full blood and dialogue, not edited and looks beautiful on the blu-ray remastered.  At least they did the best saga on blu-ray before petering out.",1354492800,,214,4.605263157894737
4663451,4,B005E2YL40,I liked it but i don't see the blue ray quality it looks standard to me. and its NOT 1080p because itsscaled to a 4:16 ratio. -.-,1350518400,,129,3.814814814814815
4663452,5,B005E2YL40,"I would have easily paid $30 to $40 each for these.  Hands down, this is the most visually stunning and in my opinion the only ""good"" version of Dragon Ball Z available.  In all honesty, my jaw dropped the first time I stuck these disks into my PS3 and watched them.  Now, I know there is a lot of controversy about what is happening with this set recently.  For anyone who doesn't already know; Funimation has TEMPORARILY halted the release of future ""DBZ Level Blurays"" due to the fact that the process is very expensive and sales have been less than stellar for some reason.  I don't believe they will cancel it because for one, it's DBZ, which is their highest grossing show and also they released a statement saying that they are researching more economical ways of getting this product to the fans.  So, I urge all who is a true fan of DBZ.  This is what you have been waiting for.  Kai is crap.  It ends with the Cell Saga which means it's not just a fancy edit, it's also not even the full show for crying out loud.  Not buying these blurays because you are afraid they won't release the rest is only going to add to the problem.  Buy the sets and show your support; they are cheap as hell right now.  Contact Funimation and tell them you want more.  Spread the word about these sets.  I guarantee you won't be sorry.",1343260800,12,1325,4.333333333333333
4663453,2,B005E2YL40,"With no plans to release 1.3 now as the project has been ""haulted"". The fans who invested in the first two Blu-Rays are estentially screwed over... and just when they seemed to be getting it right. Screw funimation... I will no longer be purchasing any of their products/re;eases and hope nothing but the worst for them down the road.",1339545600,,334,4.677966101694915
4663454,5,B005E2YL40,"This comment is for all of you that wish a 16:9 ratio.

The original video material is in 4:3 even if they would make this remaster in a 16:9 they could not paint some new pictures to the right and left side to hae a fully 16:9 picture. So they would cut out some pictureinformation from the top and the bottom and we would get a cripple of DBZ.

In my own opinion i do not want somebody to cut away some parts of the original..

Sorry for my bad english, i am from germany :)",1336953600,19,476,3.9375
4663455,3,B005E2YL40,"All the new remastered levels of DBZ are great but why even make it in blu ray if the ratio is not 16:9.  Hardly anyone has tube televisions anymore so thats almost in a way what you are watching.  Even the remastered dvd versions are in 16:9.  It just doesnt make any sense.  Its like an oxymoron.  You get it in bluray but you also are looking a picture that should be on a tube television.

Thanks,

Big DBZ Fan",1332460800,,414,4.1
4663456,1,B005E2YL40,"Yes. Funimation has indefinitely postponed the Dragon Ball Z Blu-Ray restorations (though not Kai). This is a sad day indeed. Apparently there is a technology or other issue. But Level 1.2 was the last, though there might be advance copies of 2.1 floating around.

But as of Jan 2012, this restoration project has been indefinitely postponed (likely cancelled)!

I just thought everyone would like to know before buying the available copies and then not having the rest of the set coming out anytime in the foreseeable future.

In the meantime, DBZ Kai is what I have been purchasing.  It does chop out a lot of the filler content, but it holds true to the DBZ story that Akira Toriyama created and intended before Toei started stretching the series out longer.  The restoration on the Kai Blu-Ray is pretty amazing for the most part.  I understand it is a simpler restoration process, but watching on a 46"" TV from my PS3, the show looks great.  And they kept the 4:3 ratio.

But for DBZ Level (instert # here)? You Fail on this one Funimation!  I will delete this review when they announce they are producing the rest of these sets.",1332288000,17,1134,4.658291457286432

8467871,4,B005E2YL40,"This was easily the best remastering that Dragon Ball Z has ever gotten but FUNimation decided to cancel due to the costs, time and supposedly the sales were not sufficient to keep releasing this.

It's quite a shame because if the entire series had been released with this picture quality we would never need another remasterisation due to having hit perfection for how the show was intended to look at its best, with all the grain, detail and uncropped fullscreen aspect ratio.

Level 1.2 covered the episodes 018-034 which were from the Saiyan arc (although it is missing 035-039 these unreleased ones are available on Xbox Video (via Xbox & PC) and PlayStation Network for purchase).

Nevertheless, this is worth owning for the Dragon Ball hardcore collectors because regardless this was never finished it's still nice to see what Dragon Ball Z could have looked like as a whole.",1406332800,,883,4.912751677852349

Unlike the Dragon Box, it includes the english dub with japanese music as well as the american soundtrack (and of course the Japanese mono)
For any fan in any region, this is the best quality DBZ release by far. Unfortunately it was halted prematurely. Personally i would have loved to see an HD Buu Saga with american music... Oh well.",1393891200,,424,4.5064935064935066

8467875,4,B005E2YL40,"This review covers both the 1.1 and the 1.2 level set on blu ray, I will try to do my best to write a fair review.

Video- The video looks great, it hasn't been altered and is presented in a 4x3 format, it takes up the entire screen on a widescreen television but there are black bars, this set actually doubles in a way because if I use my TV remote and hit zoom fit to screen then boom I have an image similar to the cropped blu ray set they released.  The picture still has grain to show detail and the colors are wonderful and they aren't washed out.

Audio- I've never had any problems with the DBZ audio in terms of quality, the only problem was whether it was present or not on any particular release.  This one included the 2 English tracks, 1 with Japanese music and one with the ""Bruce"" soundtrack, as always it sound great, if anyone has any questions Ill go more in depth but im fairly certain people are concerned about the video not the audio

Personally I think this set is great and im comparing this to other DBZ releases I own which include the Rock The Dragon set, Orange brick collection, movies on dvd, and finally the dragon box set.  The level set isn't perfect though because its been put on hold and these poor cropped versions have been made instead, ive compared these to the level sets and these are clearly superior in terms of video quality due to picture quality and the fact that it is not cropped.  If your a fan and your looking for the best viewing experience then I cant in good conscious recommend the other blu ray set, Id say go for the Dragon Box set, its quality is wonderful but you'll have  problem acquiring the second set because its quite expensive, around $400 eBay.

In closing I feel everyone should buy these level sets and support them, the other release as shown here http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00GS4B7GS/ref=s9_newr_gw_d43_g74_i2?pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&pf_rd_s=center-5&pf_rd_r=0A3DKE4CYRF14Y5GDSQ3&pf_rd_t=101&pf_rd_p=1688200302&pf_rd_i=507846
Should not be supported, the picture quality is inferior and the cropping is an insult, all it takes is the hit of a button on a TV remote to force a 4x3 image into widescreen with cropping.  what's going to end up happening is people will buy the blu ray set and later on they'll release an uncut 4x3 set that complete and people will run out and buy that too, similar to the people buying the dragon box sets who owned the orange brick sets.  In closing I cant give this 5 stars because its not complete nor will it be but its the best way to watch the Saiyan saga on Blu Ray so for this I give the overall product 4/5 stars.  I know I might've babbled and some people might complain but I wanted to get my message out and I refuse to write a bogus 1 star review on the inferior cropped versions, I hope this helped and if anyone has any questions about the set Id be more than happy to answer them.",1392076800,6,2905,4.5761078998073215

The Nathan Johnson (and further down the line Bruce Faulconer) music sounds amazing.
