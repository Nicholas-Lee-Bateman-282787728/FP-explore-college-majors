6412923,5,B00KB49LAK,"Bronco completes the Warner Trilogy.. First we had Cheyenne, followed by Sugarfoot and finally Bronco Layne hits the DVD shelf! It's worth the wait especially this first season when Warner went hell bent for leather to create a new star as Clint Walker refused at that time to film more Cheyenne shows. I love all 3 of these western cousins. I have my box set now and there are some superb episodes. It's fun to see the Cheyenne artwork to the Bronco theme! Great to see they have left the Sugarfoot promos at the end of each episode. Ty Hardin takes the reins confidently right from the start and I thoroughly recommend this brilliant set. Roll on season 2. Also let's hope Lawman finds it's way onto the DVD schedule",1406246400,51,718,4.530769230769231
6412924,5,B00KB49LAK,The long wait is over . I placed my order to day and will wait for the balance seasons . Bronco was a rugged western and well made with outdoor locations . In many ways Ty was a better actor than Clint walker and did not get the stardom he should have . This is also true of Eric Fleming from Rawhide who was a better actor and the actual star of Rawhide and not Clint Eastwood . We'll Clint Eastwood got a break and Eric died while shooting a movie in the river of a Latin American country . Let's wAtch Bronco again and enjoy the great western actor who could have been a bigger star .,1406160000,35,587,3.983050847457627
6412925,5,B00KB49LAK,Bronco came about because of dispute between Warner Brothers and Clint Walker over the Cheyenne series.  Ty Hardin is a natural as Bronco Layne.  It's classic TV western story-telling with lots of familiar faces guest-starring.  A must have if you're a fan!,1470614400,,257,5.071428571428571

6412927,4,B00KB49LAK,"I know I watched many of these episodes in their original run when I was a kid, but I didn't remember any of them.  It was great fun to see them anew and recognize many of the guest actors from the Warner Bros. stable and other TV series.",1468281600,,238,3.9583333333333335
6412928,5,B00KB49LAK,"I honestly didn't remember Bronco from when I was a kid(1960's) but now that I've started watching it, it was as good as any TV western ever.  Ty Hardin had a certain likeableness to him that grows on you.  If you like westerns do yourself a service and get Bronco!",1462406400,,265,4.28
6412929,5,B00KB49LAK,This is another gem from days past and I recommend buying all 4 seasons.  A majority of these Westerns were produced from the period of 1955 to 1965 and they were basically Pure Art.  If I had a million dollars I would go out and locate all of the Westerns that have not been transferred to DVD and do so.  A lot of these archives are not being produced most likely because this body of work is SO MUCH BETTER than the garbage put out today.,1455667200,,441,4.104651162790698
6412930,4,B00KB49LAK,"TV westerns have always been a favourite of mine since I was a young boy. The first TV western I ever saw on the small screen was The Rifleman. I still believe that it is and still remains the best western series ever produced.  Not far behind are the likes of Rawhide, Bronco, Cheyenne and The Lawman.  As a young person all the lads and girls for that matter watched TV westerns. We couldn't wait to re-enact the TV show and role play our favourite heroes in school playground the next day. I can remember everybody wanted to be Bronco as he appeared cool and calm and had a likeable personality. As I view the old westerns in my library (in most cases purchased from Amazon) you will find a number of guest actors seem to appear on a regular basis.  The guest stars in most cases play the important role of the Baddie. The baddie or villain was always shot and killed by the hero during the show. The realism portrayed by the baddie could determine the quality of the show.  We also had our favourite baddies. These include Robert Wilkie, Jack Elam, Lee Van Cleef and James Best. When I ordered Bronco I was initially a little bit apprehensive in doing so, believing that not having seen the series since I was a young lad it may have lost its nostalgia.  I was concerned also that the quality of the product may have diminished over the years. Much to my surprise the stories and the acting is of a very high standard and the black and white is crystal clear. As I watch the series I feel I must compliment Warner Brothers who have done an excellent job in re-producing the series, and I highly recommend it to all those western lovers.",1455494400,3,1640,4.381578947368421

6412934,5,B00KB49LAK,"November, 2015:  ""Bronco"" is currently airing locally on COZI-TV, a sub-channel of our NBC affiliate, and it is close-captioned.  WHY, OH WHY, WARNER BROTHERS, AREN'T THE DVDS???  Before I bought these MOD DVDs, I taped (Yes, I mean taped, being the Luddite that I am) all 68 episodes on VHS.  If I am stumped by some piece of dialogue and NEED to know what was said, I can always check the tape.

I remember ""Bronco"" from its original airings, but now that I'm older, I am more captivated by it, and by its hunk of a star.  It's also highly unusual and wonderfully gratifying to discover that the over-the-air versions are nearly uncut, except for the episode opening sequences, the ""Sugarfoot"" promos, and the full theme song.  Also please note, these DVDs are described as ""All region,"" which I will be testing out...just as soon as I finish binge-watching the other three seasons I haven't seen yet!

December, 2015:  All done now, several times over.  One of the sets had a defective disc, but I got a no-hassle replacement from amazon.  I was suspicious that MOD DVDs wouldn't play on an all-region player, but mine had no problems with them.  I would add that I now have the complete series, 1-4, and have become completely addicted to them.  Thank goodness I'm retired and have the time to spend!

The quality of the reproduction is excellent, but as I noted above, I wish Warner had close-captioned these DVDs.  It's not the sound quality, it's the rare use of colloquial expressions, purportedly from the 1860s, that are sometimes difficult to make out.  Also, Bronco Layne didn't cuss, smoke, drink (one beer, rarely, and in the later seasons only), or mistreat women, and he loved kids and animals, including his pet cat (Ep. 1.5, ""Long road back"").  Remarkably, for the 1959-1962 time frame in network television history, there were frequent Native American and occasional black characters who were usually ""the good guys,"" unlike almost all Westerns of the day.  I'm so-o-o-o-o glad I bought this set...and worried that I need to get out more!",1446076800,,2057,4.811965811965812

6412941,5,B00KB49LAK,"Another western I never heard of.  Surprisingly good.  Bronco is a good guy wanderer in the 1870;s west and therefore there is no steady cast or any single set.  One of the better westerns I have seen and the main character is played as a confident and tough young man.  Gunfights, fistfights, holdups, robberies, cattle drives and the standard western fare.  If you liked the show ""Cheyenne"" this is on the same line.  Really a good show and the plot lines are nothing to scoff at.

Never saw Bronco even reruns but after watching think it second rate to Cheyenne, Bonanza and actually most westerns of the era. I saw reruns of most of the others and it was, I believe, because of Ty Hardin that Bronco seemed to lag.  My opinion?  He was simply not the right choice for such a starring role.  The guest stars seemed to have been holding it together while it lasted.  Hardin appeared plastic and uncomfortable in the role given (he tried and that was noticeable); maybe season 2 will show improvement on his part?",1421193600,4,680,4.625

I have not watched Bronco for at least fifty years,and as soon as I was notified that the show was available on DVD I purchased my copy through Amazon, To date, I am pleased to inform one and all that I have watched Season 1 three times, but then again I am a fan of this show.

Ty Hardin is a good actor, and I know that this is a big call, but I do not think any other actor of that era could have brought Bronco to life better than him. Hardin was Bronco, and I do not know whether the show would have been the huge success that was without him in the lead role.

 As a fan of the show I would encourage younger people who read this review and have never seen Bronco to purchase Season 1, and check it out, who knows you too may become a loyal fan of the show.

I wish to also inform all Bronco fans that Season 2 is now available and I have just purchased my copy.

In closing, I would like to thank Amazon for making  Bronco Season 1 and 2 available to International customers, and I continue to urge them to use their market power and pressure Warner Brothers(WB) to release Season 3 and 4 of this show and while in discussions with WB, urge them to release Lawman, because I think that this show will have a heap of old guys just waiting to purchase the DVD's of this show also.

All the Best

These series alternated with each other as you will see. At the end of each episode of Bronco on this DVD, a trailer for next weeks episode of Sugarfoot appears.
Plenty of guest stars appear in this show like:
William Reynolds (The FBI)
Robert Vaughn (The Man from U.N.C.L.E.)
Mike Connors (Mannix)
All the episodes are good but here are my favourites:

THE BESIEGED
A family belonging to a peaceful religious sect are attacked by gunmen. Claude Akins (Movin On) guest stars along with Jack Elam.

FOUR GUNS AND A PRAYER
Bronco, appointed temporary marshal, hires three friends to help clear the town of killers who control it.

FREEZE-OUT
Mary Brown hires Bronco to take her to a  ghost town at the foot of a glacier. But what is she really looking for there. James Drury (The Virginian) guests.

THE SILENT WITNESS
A mute little girl is witness to a murder.

THE BELLS OF SILVER FLAT
A reverend saves Bronco's life from a gunman. But is the Reverend more than he seems. Pernell Roberts (Bonanza) guests

HERO OF THE TOWN
Bronco must clear his name when three masked men rob the bank and the banker is found dead holding onto Bronco's gun.

PRAIRIE SKIPPER
A retired sea captain is travelling across the west with his new bride. But the bride is being pursued by her husband unknown to the sea captain. Lorne Greene (Bonanza) guests.
This is an interesting episode as the back story to the character of Ben Cartwright played by Lorne Greene on Bonanza was
also a sea captain before travelling west.",1410825600,3,1910,4.6301775147929

Minus: without English Subtitles (SDH)

Big PLUS: starring attractive looking Ty Hardin as Bronco Layne.

a great plus: very good picture Quality

Another great plus: entertaining (and sometime complex) stories
big plus: all those great guest stars like Jack Elam, Claude Atkins, William Reynolds, Shirley Knight, eye catching Douglas Dick, James Coburn, James Drury,Robert Vaughan, Troy Donahue, Mike Connors, Lorne Greene, Bing Russell, Michael Forest, Dorothy Provine.

We're getting 1000+ minutes of entertainment from WARNER BROTHERS classic golden age TV WESTERN era which run at the same time like ""Sugarfoot"", ""Cheyenne"" etc.

Currently $ 37.00 might be fine for 1000+ minutes of entertainment in pretty good condition/picture quality but dissapointing again: no subtitles.

Fazit: great show and for fans of TY HARDIN a must!!!! Trademark of this show: Beefcake/bare-chest scenes with Ty Hardin. In the episode ""Baron of Broken Lance"" its not Ty Hardin but William Reynolds (!!!)",1410480000,11,1013,5.631578947368421
6412986,5,B00KB49LAK,"I find it distracting when a preview comes on at the beginning or end of a show, like it does with all these Bronco episodes, because I don't want the plot spoiled for me, so I do a fast scan to the beginning of the show. And I also do a fast scan at the end where they show a preview of next week's episode, because again, I don't want the plot spoiled for me, because I intend to watch it next or the next day.  However, at the end of the third episode, as I was scanning through, I saw one of my favorite actors from the past, Tommy Rettig as a teenager in a guest star role, so I stopped to watch the preview, got real excited about seeing him in the next episode, and as I was watching episode 4, he never appeared. So I thought, maybe these episodes are out of sync, but I looked at all the discs and couldn't find the episode called The Ghost. I then went back to episode 3, watched next week's preview again, until I finally realized that this was a preview of The Sugarfoot series, which alternated with Bronco. The Sugarfoot previews at the end of each show are about 2 minutes long and practically give away the whole plot, but you get to see all the guest stars, so you can make a decision as to purchase this set or not, it does look interesting.",1410307200,4,1259,4.097165991902834

6412992,4,B00KB49LAK,"One of those fondly-remembered series from the Golden Age of the TV western returns in this 20-episode package which should please both newcomers and returnees. Admittedly, many of the episodes are little more than routine, though in a pleasantly nostalgic way, but there are a few stand-outs, most notably the ""Freeze Out"" episode in which Bronco finds himself involved in a mystery with a small group of people gathered in a ghost town high in the mountains, next to a glacier. Many familiar actors appear in the shows' supporting casts, such reliable and always welcome actors as Claude Akins, Jack Elam, Ray Danton, Shirley Knight, James Coburn, Veda Ann Borg, and Lorne Greene. And yes, Ty Hardin -- who should have developed into something better than he actually did -- bares that chest of his in no less than ten of these twenty episodes. (The best viewing of Ty's chest comes in the ""Silent Witness"" episode in which he works in a mine. Hot sweaty work, digging in a mine.)  .",1410048000,3,985,4.760233918128655

After watching six excellent episodes the I notice the DVD case says for historical context  Bronco, which was part of The Cheyenne Show, will show the Cheyenne artwork and theme. The version I received from Amazon the episodes start with the typical Warner Brothers introduction followed the Bronco artwork and then starring Ty Hardin with the Bronco song. The credits at the end shows the Cheyenne artwork with the Bronco song. I have always thought the Bronco song was introduced for the second series. Is the version I have received for the UK market only and the USA market being sold the historical version as stated on the DVD case? Comments are most welcome to this excellent western series.",1409270400,,755,4.94488188976378

There are 20 episodes which are well written and acted. Bronco gets his shirt off for the ladies.

The stories are different to keep up the interest and of course take me back to the good old days of westerns. There are some interesting guest stars including Mike Connors (Mannix), Pernell Roberts and Lorne Greene (Bonanza), Lee van Cleef with hair and a short role by Troy Donahue (Hawaian Eye).

I've got all the Cheyenne, Wyatt Earp, Wagon Train and Rawhide DVDs - they are all great and so fondly remembered - but have been waiting for the Bronco ones for decades. Thank goodness Warners have released these whilst many of us diehard fans are still on this planet. Fell in love with the character from the start (sorry Cheyenne, Wyatt, Flint and Gil) and have waited decades to see these again - British TV never showed re-runs :-( , so can't wait for my DVDs to arrive!

 Wolf Larson was the tarzan of the 90s and this was the only worth series missing so to complete our tarzan must have dvd movies and series of all time.
 this is season 1 and u can get seasons 2 and 3 at same price from amazon.
 for those who watched this in the 90s will bring you nostalgic memories back.

  FURTHER RECCOMENDATIONS

  johnny Weissmuller's.... ((back in 1979 was commitred in a madhouse thinking he was a real tarzan)), tarzan movies 1934-1948, jungle jim movies 1948-1954, jungle jim tv series 1955, followed by further tarzan movies from actors like....lex baxter, Mahoney, Gordon scott, the 1960s tarzan tv series with ron Eli, and the latest additions of the 80s, the 1981 film with bo derek and the 1984 best film greystoke lord of the apes.
 there are also further releases like the late 90s series ""THE EPIC ADVENTURES"" with joe lara plus the 1999 film TARZAN IN MANHATTAN and the later releases of the new millennium like the not so good TARZAN AND THE LOST CITY and the 2003 series of just 8 episodes which were canselled but they are not worth it.
 finally we had last year's epic new film legend of tarzan .
 except for the 2003 series all others were released in dvd and this 1991 series was the only worth series never released in dvd so far.

 So get this series with the rest I mentioned and u have all tarzan movies // series worth buying in your dvd collection for the past 80 years.",1483228800,2,1520,4.52014652014652
