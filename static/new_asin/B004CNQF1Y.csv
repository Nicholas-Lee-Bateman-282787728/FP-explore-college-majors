8623186,5,B004CNQF1Y,"Four years have elapsed since the documentary which followed the exploits if tenth rate rock band; Bad News was filmed. With the film crew wanting to catch up with them, and see them reunited in the hopes of seeing the former band members give it one last shot at rock stardom. The result is car crash TV at its finest as past disputes and clashes of egos come to the fore which open prove to be the beginning of their problems.

After the commercial and critical success of Hollywood director; Rob Reiners; Spinal Tap which I think it is likely to say was inspired by; Bad News Tour which preceded it two years previously, it seemed inevitable that Adrian Edmondson would want to revisit what one of his more satisfying endeavours as a writer with; More Bad News. An adroit decision given that while an amusing, pointed satire it suffered slightly from its minimal half hour running time. With the Comic Strip team having finally hit their stride as; Bad News Tour aired during their first series and they had gained critical momentum and a loyal cult fan base, the powers that be were willing to afford him the carte blanche to expand on the premise of his earlier project. Clocking in at 50 minutes in length and although the old adage dictates that less is more, that doesnt apply to; More Bad News Tour.

With Edmondson collaborating once more with fellow Comic Strip team members, the late: Rik Mayall, (who had been and would continue to be his frequent writing partner and collaborator on anarchic sitcoms like; The Young Ones, Filthy Rich & Catflap and Bottom) Nigel Planer and Peter Richardson, one if they were inclined towards cynicism might believe that Edmondson was attempting to coast off a past glory, (although the word glory might be a slight exaggeration) the pay off proves to be rewardingly waggish viewing experience than its predecessor.

Recasting wife and past co-star Jennifer Saunders as rock chick journalist; Sally Friedman who essentially hosts the documentary as she catches up with the guys, establishing what has become of the curious quartet. In the wake of their calamitous, ill ineffectual quest where past footage highlights that due to the inevitable friction and discord within the band (primarily between Edmondsons Vim Fuego and Mayalls Colin Grigson) which played on vital part in their ignominious breakup, it had led to each of them going their own separate ways. Vim with ostentatious pretensions remaining intact has become a self styled metaphysical psychic who still composes (if thats what one could call it) songs that hes ripped off from pre-existing material. Colin after flunking out of college has become a clerk in bank and still loves with his doting mother, while Den (Planer) is self employed as a painter/decorator. Last but not least, and with this band of misfits thats saying something is the wild man Spider (Richardson). Now a kept man so to speak, he lives with his hippy wife who is bemusing in her apathy towards her husband leaving her and the kids behind to go on the road again with the band.

What follows is thematically much of the same as we saw before with the structural framework given a different spin. We bear witness to the cardboard rock star wannabes attempting to over indulge and live the life of self indulgent excess. From ordering 100 pints of larger in an Indian restaurant, leaving the documentary film crew with deeper pockets to cover the cost of, to a an orgy of wanton destruction in a drunken hotel room wreck it chronicles their pathetic artificial attempts at rock anarchy. While amongst all of this naively placing their faith in small time record company, the ironically titled; Frilly Pink which leads to a humiliating experience when the lads attempt to buy their new single in a record store. Their combined ineptitude and lack of self awareness is also sharply and hilariously observed as they film the music video for their dbut single; Warriors of Genghis Kahn.

Watching the horrendous car crash that is taking place before our and very eyes, and examining it in hindsight brings to mind low rent punk rock bad; The Towers of London. Delusional guys like like; Towerslead vocalist; Donny Tourette and his fellow band members are the kind of shallow hellraisers deserving of scorn and ridicule that they were sending up.

Finally culminating in their booked appearance at; The Monsters of Rock Festival which has the well judged bonus of having genuine rock icons which consist of; Ozzy Osbourne, Def Leppard, Motorhead and Scorpions being briefly interviewed, scathingly contemptuous in their critique of the comical anti-heroes. Figuratively burying them and acting as the final nail in the coffin before the curtain finally closes on the film which tops its prequel in terms of its nihilistic, downbeat finale. More Bad News marks one of the finer works of the Comic Strip Presents fairly long run. With the same adeptly executed comedy performances and smart scripting from Edmondson it along with; Mr. Jolly Lives Next Door (which he co-wrote and starred alongside with Mayall) and; Eddie Monsoon, a Life showcases his prowess as a writer and the cohesive talents of the team.",1518048000,,5186,4.914383561643835
