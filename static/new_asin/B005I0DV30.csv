4707660,5,B005I0DV30,What's not to like and enjoy about Christmas.  These movies are made to make you think of others at this time of the year and not just yourself.,1359676800,,144,4.142857142857143
4707661,4,B005I0DV30,"I love the Christmas holiday, and each year I find myself purchasing CDs and DVDs to set the right holiday mood.  The TV movies on this DVD were new to me, so I purchased them.  Enjoyable.",1358899200,,188,4.194444444444445
4707662,2,B005I0DV30,WHEN  MY DVD'S ARRIVED I COULD HARDLY WAIT TO WATCH THEM. MUCH TO MY SURPRISE THERE WERE ONLY 2 MOVIES I LIKED. AND BOTH WERE IN COLOR. ALL THE OTHERS WERE OLD MOVIES IN BLACK AND WHITE. I  WAS VERY DISAPOINTED.,1357603200,,211,4.121951219512195
4707663,4,B005I0DV30,I purchased this basically for two movies but it was a great deal for all.  The only con is that these packaged movies don't look that great on a bigger screened HDTV.  Looks blown up too much.  Still a good deal especially if you have a standard definition TV.,1357344000,,261,4.285714285714286

4707665,5,B005I0DV30,"Scrooge & Beyond Tomorrow are black & white.  Had I paid attention to the year the movies were released, I would have noticed that but probably would have bought the set anyway since it is a really good deal with some great movies.",1353110400,,231,4.372093023255814

4707667,5,B005I0DV30,"This isn't really a review. I just feel that Amazon doesn't give enough information about this DVD collection. I'm adding this so any potential buyer might to be able to make an informed purchasing decision. This is a two disc set that contains six movies and ten bonus Christmas carols. So far, I have viewed one of the movies and spot checked the rest of them. Six movies on two discs is a lot of information crammed onto each disc and frankly, I wasn't expecting much in the way of quality. I made the purchase regardless however, and was delightfully surprise. The quality was quite nice, and far exceeded my expectations.

8474084,4,B005I0DV30,"For what you're getting here, this is a great deal, even though not all of the movies included would rate four stars individually.

""A Christmas Visitor"" probably is the strongest film included. Tearjerker about a dead young soldier who returns in tangible otherworldly form at Christmas. Well-written and good performances by the whole cast.

""Angel in the Family"" (which, like the above, also stars Meredith Baxter) also deals with the return of a deceased loved one at Christmas. A very strong entry which is at one time both funny, heartwarming and gut-wrenching.

""A Holiday to Remember"" is more hokey, especially with leading man Randy Travis as  the long-ago ex-fiance of a successful career woman who comes back across the country to her small  hometown from the big city. The tangent with the runaway is a bit annoying.

""Christmas Snow"" has the shortest run time at just under an hour and deals with an older woman who runs a candy shop with her two adopted young children. Decent but not the best. Featuring a young Melissa Joan Hart.

""Beyond Tomorrow"" is an interesting 1940 black-and-white film and not a Christmas movie in the strictest sense, although it does open with a Christmas setting. Three rich old lonely men make a bet on Christmas Eve to try to get some guests to a private dinner party and end up luring a young man and young woman. The three men later die in a plane crash and return as ghosts. (Yeah...more back-from-the-dead stuff.) An interesting inclusion and a better movie than I was expecting.

""Scrooge."" Yet another version of this that I hadn't seen previously, a black-and-white film version that clocks in at an hour long. Not one of the more memorable efforts at the story although I did find it interesting that Jacob Marley is only heard and not seen.

The included digital music is a nice bonus too.",1387497600,3,1843,4.788643533123029
8474085,5,B005I0DV30,"it is so nice to have 6 movies all together on one two dvds...they say it is Christmas in july .....I already watched the ""Christmas Visitor""....I love it...",1374451200,,157,4.642857142857143

Two of the movies I did not like and did not watch them to the end,  I would recommend  three of the other movies to family and friends.  It's also hard to get something you have not seen before as there are so many movies and so e with the same title but different story lines.",1373241600,,308,4.016393442622951
