6119409,4,B00GV8B02C,"""I don't think I let the people in my life down by making the wrong choices. I think I let them down by convincing myself I never had a choice to begin with."" James (Lofranco) has been in and out of correction facilities his entire life since he was 8. After his latest stunt lands him in prison he looks back over his life and his choices. He sets out to straighten out his life, but it's not as easy as he was hoping. I knew nothing about this story going in. Once again though the fact that this is a true story made me more excited about it going in. While not nearly as powerful the movie did remind me a little of American History X in the the way that a person can live his life one way without apologizing but when removed from that life he realizes the error in his ways and tries everything he can to change. There are some pretty big names in this movie but the kid that plays James is a perfect choice and really carries as well as outshines everyone else. While this is in no way a perfect movie I do recommend this and was surprised by how good it was. Overall, a lighter version of American History X that I recommend. The fact that this was a true story helped as well. I give this an A-.",1390521600,8,1204,4.063025210084033
6119410,4,B00GV8B02C,"The story is told from a prison flashback. The plot runs in the present with flashbacks to the past. This is done rather plainly, i.e. they didn't try to tie lessons learned in the street to doing things in prison. James is a troubled youth with an ankle bracelet. He starts a life of crime, gets caught and writes poetry, of which we hear very little. He is supposedly mentored in prison by Ving Rhames, but those scenes are infrequent, and the relationship is not well established.

His mom (Mary-Louise Parker) stood by him when nobody else would. Jamesy shows that while he is a criminal who deals drugs and robs people, he is basically a softy at heart. A so-so plot of a mixed up kid who did time in prison. The acting was good.

6119444,5,B00GV8B02C,"With most criminal movies it's very hard to be on the side of the criminal. But the movie made you empathize with the criminal character because it was clear that since he was a little boy he was dragged through the justice system and was basically raised by it. Most of us know someone who has been dragged through the ineffective justice system and know that this movie is very true. But while the justice system is often unjust, there is still a way for people to get out of its cycle and James Burns proved it. This movie is based on a true story.",1489017600,,551,4.257142857142857

6119449,3,B00GV8B02C,"I have always been a huge fan of real life drama, because lets face it, some of this stuff you just can't make up. Even the best writers couldn't imagine some of the things these people have had to endure, and it makes for some amazing films. On the otherside of that, there are other stories, which just aren't that unique or interesting, and in my opinion really don't warrent a full length feature film, Jamesy Boy is an example of this. James (Spencer Lofranco) is your typical rebellious kid from a single parent home. He's not poor and has a lot of opportunities, but for whatever reason, he's turned to drugs and crime. He's living the gangsta life on the streets until the inevitable happens, and he winds up in jail. Once there, James witnesses a crime, and meets a man who helps him unlock a talent he never knew he had, but will James turn to the straight and narrow or will his friends pull him back into his old life? This is a true story and newcomer Spencer Lofranco was fantastic, but haven't we seen stories like this done over and over again? To be honest the only reason I kept watching it was to see which path James chose after prison. I wanted to see how his life turned out, but either way, we've seen films like this many times before and Jamesy Boy doesn't stand out in any type of significant way. If you want to do a film that has been done over and over again, true story or not, there has to be something about it that makes it stand out from the pack, and that doesn't happen here. The bottom line, Jamesy Boy is decent and it's fine if you're just looking to kill a couple of hours. It features a pretty good up and coming young talent and some old familiar faces, but beyond that, there's nothing really special about it.",1468454400,,1753,4.315151515151515

6119480,1,B00GV8B02C,"OVERATED!  Really weak and dragging storytelling.  Overhyping, YET boring and dull and PREDICTABLE outcomes.

Yes it reveals what happens in some criminal minds but really doesn't solve or UNGLORIFY it enough to make a kid think twice before doing dumb s***.  So in essence a worthless waste of your time.

ALSO, the secondary characters are WEAK including VIng Rhames, at least if you come from a realistic point of view as if you have any prison experience there are BETTER characters and REALER characters than how Rhames played it.  Jail movies RARELY get things right and this is no exception. However, Black Eyed Peas man did do a great job.  The main character was played decently, nothing amazing or great about the role or story.

Just over a WEAK movie, with a WEAK theme of ""redemption"" and taking the regular working hard route.  This justifies criminal activity and violence like Scarface, BUT it is NO WHERE near as good as capturing the criminal mindstate as that classis. Waste time at your own risk in watching this overated movie that NEVER should have been made",1420675200,,1080,4.826086956521739

6119520,4,B00GV8B02C,"This isn't a new story by any means, but it's dressed up real good.

Here's the scoop. James (Spencer Lofranco) is not a stupid kid and it seems his waters run deep, but he has a violent streak and always seems to be in trouble. He feels the world has given up on him so what the heck? Now he's in prison and has a better view or what lies down he road and figures his way of looking at things might need a tune-up. The mechanic to help comes in the form of Ving Rhames.

I liked this a lot. I like that James isn't a two dimensional character. Even in his bad boy mode he keeps a journal. He's self assured which puts him in the good graces of the local thug. This self assuredness also helps him through some really dicey situations. But now he's in the joint and he sees how screwed up everything is. James Woods (at his most vile) is the warden and refuses to right a situation involving another convict that Jamesy warns him about. The outcome drives home the fact that he needs to get out of there.

The story is formatted to show him in prison and periodically cuts back to the events leading up to his arrest and conviction. His mom is played by Mary-Louise Parker. I could have used a few more minutes of her. Ving Rhames is Okay but, given the impact he was supposed to have on James, his part needed a few more pages as well. Taissa Farmiga is good as the girl James thinks would be better for him than the degenerate Crystal. All the other supporting roles don't stick out as sub-par.

This is a slick, no-nonsense approach to this ""based on a true story"" tale. Nothing flashy just a good old meat and potatoes approach to things. Not the best movie you'll ever see but well worth your time.",1407715200,,1703,4.214723926380368

Despite looking all too much like a made for TV movie of the week, this prison drama is much better than its very limited theatrical release and tepid internet reviews imply.  (And that's why I never listen to other critics!)

Newcomer Spencer Lofranco plays James, a troubled teen with behavioral issues who can't find a place in society and goes down the tempting path of crime.  Based on a true story, the story is told in two timelines, one of James' experiences in prison, and the other of what led to him being there.  The story, script, and cast, featuring compelling supporting performances by James Woods, Ving Rhames, and Mary-Louise Parker make this film definitely worth your time if you like the genre.  If only they had a little more money to clean up the cinematography this one would have at least made a bigger splash on the big screen, giving it a fair chance at getting seen.  Unfortunately it's been doomed to a virtually unacknowledged existence on VOD.  Don't overlook it!

Grade: A-

Who is this movie for?  Fans of troubled youth, gang, and prison films like 'Shawshank Redemption' and 'American History X' should find it satisfying (though it's clearly not in the same class as those classics.)

Gritty yet inspiring, based-upon-a-true story of an angry young gangster-criminal who gets paroled, faces the hardships of being a parolee, and manages to stay out despite the temptations of going back to his old ""friends"" and lifestyle. The time-shifts between James as a delinquent at 14 and James as a convict several years later are well-synchronized even though his appearance hardly changes over the years. Violent with some fairly mild gore, it goes no further in those areas than is really necessary. JAMESY BOY is quite watchable, but it has neither the impact nor the originality that it aims for.

Both the script of protagonist ""Jamesy Boy"" and Spencer Lofranco's performance as same are so-so, by-the-numbers. We simply don't get to know this character as well as we should. More on his earlier life and background might have helped. Some of the supporting cast, particularly Taissa Farmiga as James's friend, might-have-been girlfriend or even wife Sarah, and Ving Rhames as the tough old convicted murderer who encourages James to pursue the catharsis of writing --something he's always halfheartedly done--give excellent performances. I agree: We hear very little of James's poetry and musings, and more in that area might have been a plus. Yet, the whole point seems to be that, even though his writing is nothing exceptional and he doesn't have any big dreams of ""making it"" as a poet/author, the very act of writing still gives James a means of expression and purpose that saves him in the end.

Probably worth seeing if you generally like crime drama with young gangster characters and prison settings.",1390694400,,1636,5.097014925373134
8627808,2,B00GV8B02C,"I wanted to like this. I tend to be biased towards truth based film, but this was just kinda MEH! Not really a great premise. Not great acting. Not even decent writing considering the prime subject is an aspiring writer.

Not really good story telling by any measure. I found myself skipping through a lot of it.

Oh well. Win a few, lose most. C'est la vie.",1532044800,,358,4.3283582089552235
