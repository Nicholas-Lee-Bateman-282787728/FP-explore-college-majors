It is the director, Richard Linklater's genius, to space the films 9 years apart so we can glimpse the unfolding of a complicated and articulate relationship. which surely captures the challenges and surprises of a modern marriage.",1372204800,2,387,5.158730158730159

2354008,5,B000A2WAEM,"I'd never heard of these films until I read a brief review of Before Sunrise in Radio Times, which persuaded me to watch. I was absolutely enthralled by its naturalness and the seemingly unscripted conversations between the two characters.  By the end I was desperate to know if there was a sequel, so I was delighted when I checked on Amazon and found that there was, and the two were available as a box set.  As soon as the box arrived, I sat down to watch Before Sunset, and once again was charmed and enthralled, though I didn't feel Paris got as much attention as Vienna, though that was probably because the second film was a lot shorter.  However I found the ending very very disappointing!  Why did we not see the couple exchange phone numbers or addresses?  Both were in unhappy relationships, so the point was made that if they freed themselves from their present partners, there would be a chance that they might get together, as they were obviously destined to be together.  I was so sad that it suddenly ended at a happy moment, but without warning!  If only we could have a belated follow-up, set in New York!",1346803200,,1123,4.52970297029703

The three of them, though made over a number of years, deserve to be viewed as three parts of a single work.  The three films are mostly conversations, all about a single relationship that develops over perhaps 20 years.  The writing is very good, sometimes amazing.  The ideas are thoughtful, some of the prose seems to have come right out of my own or my husband's mouth, and they are beautifully filmed.",1439510400,2,533,4.638297872340425

2354086,4,B000A2WAEM,"Its best to watch Before Sunrise to get a clear perspective of Before Sunset.  Before Sunrise is the story about a young man (Jesse) and a young woman (Celine) who meet on a train going to Vienna.  The young man proposes to the young woman to get off the train to spend time with him until he catches a 9:30 a.m. flight back to his home in America.  They are both on the rebound from failed romantic relationships.  As expected, they end up having sex before they separate promising to meet up again in six months at the very train station where they say their good-byes.  They do not exchange phone numbers or addresses.  Im not sure whether they even know each others last name which makes it next to impossible to find each other again.

Other important points in Before Sunrise are the young woman telling Jesse that she was visiting her grandmother in Budapest and about the loving marriage her parents share.  Jesse tells her that before his parents divorced he heard them arguing and he heard one parent proclaim to the other that his birth was a mistake.  Jesse conceives a child out-of-wedlock and in a way history repeats itself for him.

Before Sunset is the sequel to the unrequited romance that took place in Vienna nine years prior, in Before Sunset.  I was going say that I wish there was a third movie to the story between Jesse and Celine and I found the movie sequel called Before Midnight.  Im happy about that because the story in Before Sunset ends in Celines apartment in Paris.  Celine tells Jesse you're going miss your plane if he doesnt get going and Jesses response is:  I know.  I was hoping that a third sequel would have one of two alternative stories.

In Before Sunset, the game between Jesse and Celine begins when Celine shows up at a book signing for Jesse, who authored a book about their one night-stand in Vienna.  Arguably, the game began when Jesses book was published as a best seller and he visited 10 cities in 12 days to market his book which was perhaps written in hopes of finding Celine.  Jesse is practically begging for a second chance for love and passion with Celine who is playing cool.  She really works him over by keeping detached from him and he goes crazy.  Like, when she tells him she only vaguely recollects having sex with him before he had to leave Vienna and it is crystal clear that she is playing with him sensing his longing for her.  He is willing to let their meeting go at exchanging phone numbers and avoids telling her about his unhappy life in America.  After he tells her about his unhappy marriage and love for his child, Celine lays it on him think about her unhappy love life during their ride to her apartment. It was Jesses idea to give her a lift so that their conversation could continue.  Otherwise, she would have taken the metro back to her apartment.  When they arrive at her apartment, she distances herself a bit.  By the time he enters her apartment, Jesse is emotionally restrained from leaving.  The two movies revolve around the plots of limited time and certainly not enough time to really engage in a relationship beyond conversation that is detailed yet superficial.  Both people are very excited and ignited with passion (hard to describe the pretense), but it is always about the newness of their relationship.

The first story would be Celine does not allow Jesse to spend the night in her apartment even though he does miss his flight back home to his unhappy marriage and a child he absolutely loves and would choose being with the child over any woman.  Jesse stays in a hotel or goes back to the bookstore where there was an upstairs loft where he spent the night for the book signing the following day.  He would be upset and unsure but he would return to America knowing what steps to take in order for him to spend his life with Celine. Jesse felt that  both he and his spouse deserved more happiness than they were experiencing and that would have been the place to start a conversation with the mother of his child.  Somehow his wife would be receptive and they divorce amicably. He returns to Paris for Celine and whatever happens from that point forward, its all good.  End of movie. Everyone in the story is happy and the audience believes in love.

The second alternative movie that I imagined would be Jesse and Celine sleep together in her Paris apartment since he missed his flight back home where a loveless, sexless marriage awaited him.  When Jesse returns to America, he realizes with great clarity that he is really to blame for his unhappy marriage.  He puts so much energy into the missed opportunity of reuniting with Celine six months after they first met, spending four years writing a book about their one night together.  He realizes that it is unfair to his wife that he could not love her the way she should be loved because he could not get Celine out of his mind.  He could not forget Celine because she was not at the Vienna train station on June 16th, the very day they had agreed to reunite as two single, unattached soles.  He was so devastated and distraught by the fact that she did not appear as promised that he imagined that he saw her on his wedding day and during his marriage he had two recurring dreams where he either awoke in a cold sweat or awoke sobbing. He married his former girlfriend to meet his obligation to the child she was carrying.  Having slept with Celine as a married man (and vice versa regarding Celine) for Jesse means he breached his own promises and therefore was forced to lie to his wife about his whereabouts.  He realizes how much he loves his family and the life he built during his marriage and he finds a way to make his marriage work.  He tells Celine either in a letter, phone call or an in-person visit of his decision that is not based on sheer guilt.  It was waking up from the nightmares that haunted him for the past nine years.  He thought he was in love with her; he thought he found love.  Celine doesnt really understand his decision and thinks his only (true or real) motive was to get in her pants, although it was not necessarily so.  The cycle she complained about to Jesse seems to have repeated itselfall her past boyfriends married and returned to tell her that she is the one who taught them what love is.  She visits her psychologist friend that she mentions in After Sunrise and they discuss this pattern in her life in the context of her encounters with Jesse.  Celine takes responsibility for her actions or, she sees that, and hopefully how, she contributed to the status of things.  She also comes to an understanding about why she and Jesse did not lead to her finding enduring love:  Jesse realized that she isn't the love his life having been forced to tell a huge lie, if he chose to conceal his infidelity.  Celine and her current journalist photographer boyfriend have more in common through their professional hands-on work and personal interests than she and Jesse does.  Jesse was her sole-mate:  the person who helped teach her life lessons.  Celine was Jesses soul-mate, as well.",1430092800,,7085,4.550118389897396

2354125,4,B000A2WAEM,"""Before Sunrise"" manages to be atmospheric and engaging through it long takes and the resulting improvised dialogue, but Delpy's character is so unsympathetic in the sequel, it is almost derailed. Move on to the third only if you're a fan of these two, and they are great actors here, but in the end you just want Hawke to stop the car and tell her to get out.

I am reviewing this 8 years later as I purchased this two disk set to watch again with my GF. I bypass the pompous that turn these movies away but hate when people my age forget a time when we once were young adults. Forgetting that little sparks in creativity like this is what progressed us to a point that makes these ideas look simple or foolish compared to where our life has taken us now.

I hope that you all still find the simple things in life as pleasurable as they were intended. These movies do a good job to remind us to do that.",1402704000,,665,4.1953125
2354204,5,B000A2WAEM,"Where do I begin? How do I successfully express my feelings towards the ""Before"" saga in the form of an Amazon review? Especially when my feelings are so vivid, yet seem to cling to my tongue? I've tried telling friends about my love for this film saga, but I never seem to reach my own goal of satisfied proclamation. For this review, maybe I should just start from the beginning.

My first encounter with this cinematic story happened, actually, very recently. I remember seeing the poster art and advertising material, vaguely, as a child. And since the films are rated R, which automatically makes them a big no-no in my LDS home, I was never allowed to watch them. But eventually I turned 17 and I began to add films with the forbidden rating to my humble collection. Without the consent or approval of my parents. Which felt liberating. Films like Kill Bill, Evil Dead, and Apocalypto both shocked and thrilled me. The Dreamers took me to a different dimension. The Shining blew my mind. I was like a kid in the candy store, standing in front of a brand new isle, an isle only available to those who can handle the candy within.

Suffice it to say, the sweet high I got from rebelling soon went away and I began watching films based on the films themselves, not on the ratings. I was suddenly free to experience the classics, the cult films, the experimental side of cinema, and my interests broadened. As I've entered my early twenties, films like Transformers and The Avengers suddenly seem very trivial. I now crave a film with a much more substantial stroke. In the past two years I've fallen in love with films like Secret Sunshine, Another Happy Day, and even Shame, which is a film that practically slashes the very foundation of my conservative childhood. I guess you could say I'm growing up. Dang*, it feels good.

So, naturally, I read about a trilogy of films with a story that spans several years and a dedicated cast who plans to revisit the characters if life permits them to, and I am instantly intrigued. Before Sunrise? What an interesting title. My mind recalls the romantic image of the film's promotional art. Before Sunset? That image, too, of a man and a woman underneath a bridge. Then Before Midnight is being released on blu-ray, and I realize this is the perfect time to catch up, to watch this trilogy for the first time, lucky to skip the waiting periods between each release. I hop on Amazon and buy all three films, without seeing them. A ""blind buy"", or so that's what they call it.

I watch them. I fall in love. Holy shoot*, do I fall in love. Hard.

Two young people meet on a train. They talk. They debate. They can't seem to pull away from each other. And thus the saga begins, a heartwarming and heartwrenching tale of two humans being drawn together, by fate, by coincidence, by whatever, just praise the gods it's been captured on camera.

Watching Before Sunrise for the very first time gave me a sense of awe and trepidation. I felt vulnerable but giddy. Like I was feeding off the energy shared between these two fictional characters. Maybe I'm too emotionally attached to movie characters. Is that such a bad thing, though? Because from that moment and every moment since, I still get those feelings, that lump in my throat. And I'm okay with it. The film is so well acted, and so invigorating, that I can't stop thinking about it.

If the ""Before"" saga is a living, breathing body, then Before Sunrise is the miraculous birth and the awkward shift from child to teenager. Before Sunset is two things: one, it's the vast, directionless and scary glimpse a teenager takes of their own uncertain but hopeful future, and two, it's even better than the first film.

Without spoiling the story, I must say that the path of our two fictional characters, Jesse and Celine, is much more poignant and involving the second time around. The fact that Before Sunset takes place, both in real-time and in fictional-time, a good 8 or 9 years after the first adds another layer of beauty to the story. Both actors are older, emotionally and physically, but have they really changed? Watching them interact is breathtaking.

Which is partly due to the acting skills and chemistry of both Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy, both shining brightly here. Without them, these films would fall flat. The script is another blazing triumph, creating a pair of interesting people who feel authentic, funny, relatable and unlike anything seen in most romantic flicks of our time. Calling these films the pinnacle of romantic cinema might be fair praise, indeed.

Since my first viewing of these two films, which like I said was very recent, I haven't been able to erase their impact from my mind. Richard Linklater, Ethan Hawke, and Julie Delpy have created two characters who resonate so deeply with me that I'm still trying to fathom it. I feel like I'm friends with Jesse and Celine. I love them. And I cannot wait for the next chapter of their story. To eavesdrop, along with a theater full of fellow cinema lovers, lovers of these films, people who, like me, are in love with Jesse and Celine. In another 8 or 9 years, that's what I'll be doing.

In the meantime, I think I'll go watch these two films again.

Before Sunrise/Before Sunset: 5 out of 5 stars.

The DVD combo pack comes with 2 disks. Thankfully the films are spread across 2 disks as opposed to being shoved onto a single disk, which bugs me. The picture quality and audio quality are okay, considering these are DVDs and not new releases. Still, blu-ray releases of these treasured films would be greatly appreciated, at least by this movie lover. Picture/audio quality: 3.5 out of 5 stars.

Ratings: both films are rated R (which means my family will never get to experience them, a shame, but their choice) for Language and Sexual references. A few uses of the F word, along with typical language found in most PG-13 films. Some sexual references might offend some viewers. Smoking in some scenes. Honestly, I'd say ages 16 and up are fine. Although a 16 year old might not appreciate these films as much as the adults will.

I will hopefully review Before Midnight as well, which is my favorite (so far) in the ""Before"" saga.

I confess having a very difficult time watching the ending of ""Before Sunrise"" because it closely mirrored an experience of mine. It is indeed heart wrenching. The ending of ""Before Sunset"" is PERFECT. ( That's all I say. Don't want to ruin the experience for you). To buy both of these films for ~$8.00 is a bargain.

In other words, I watched all 3 within a week and then I ordered the combined DVD of the first 2 movies from Amazon. That's how much I like these movies but they are not for everyone. They are all conversational scripts and largely without music to tell you how you're supposed to be feeling at that moment. You're going to get to do that all by yourself. There are no crashes, blood, special effects or tidy little endings.

Interestingly it is not the physical locales that update us, because all three days occur in ancient locales which do not aspire to modernization but seemingly connect those who visit these sites to a well preserved and cherished antiquity. Unfortunately the dialogue not only gives insight into issues of the day but into the insecurities and despair inherent to our age. Vulgar language and advocacy for sexual immorality trap these two characters into a ever coarsening relationship which in the end is doomed by the true enemies of a loving marriage -  lack of fidelity and growing hurtful distrust. It would have been a much better movie if in the end the arid desert of modern relationships could have been watered with hope rather than cynical despair. The unhappy ending seems in vogue for the scriptwriters who now view manipulation and inevitable disloyalty the most a relationship can aspire to. May those sentiments be spit out by those who do not seek a cheapening and coarsening of marital love.",1383436800,,1430,4.88477366255144

2354294,5,B000A2WAEM,"My suggestion is to curl up with these movies and a bottle of French wine..  In Before Sunrise, soulmates Jesse and Celine meet on a train and spend the rest of what turns out to be a beautiful day and evening walking around Vienna falling in love.  Nine years later, in Before Sunset, Jesse hunts Celine down in Paris, and they spend the day walking around the city realizing what abject idiots they are.  Don't be fooled into thinking that these are chick-flicks, because they're not.  If I tell you anything else, it will spoil the movies, which unfold in an unusual, almost stream-of-consciousness way - like the camera is just following the two lovers around, eavesdropping on their real-life love affair.  Get these movies and watch them soon, because the latest, and alleged to be final sequel, Before Midnight, is being released for sale in late October.  I, for one, can't wait.

2354302,5,B000A2WAEM,"these movies are works of naturalistic beauty.  romantic and realistic, before sunrise and before sunset genuinely portray the the first two meetings between celine and jesse, as they walk the streets of vienna and paris, first as twenty-something youths, and then later as more world-weary thirty-something adults. the conversations between julie delpy and ethan hawke flow naturally and believably, and the topics range from their feelings about issues, to their more inner secrets and emotions.  delpy and hawke are perfect together, and it easy to understand how, in such a brief flicker of time, the two have irrevocably affected and altered their lives.  the camera moves so naturally and yet smoothly (yay, steadicam!), you almost forget it's there.  vienna and paris prove to be the perfect backdrop for for these emergent lovers, adding depth and texture to every scene, without distracting from celine and jesse.  with the conclusion of each movie, i found myself wanting more, anxious to follow these compelling, human people, and see their romance continue to grow.

before sunrise, the third chapter, might be the best of them all, bringing celine and jesse deeper into their lives; it will be difficult to wait another nine years to see where life takes them, although i'm hoping linklater, who directs beautifully and economically, will take these two to his hometown texas.  it is a pleasure that such thoughtful, spare, humanistic movies such as these are made and have an audience. watching them with my wife, hearing her laugh, seeing her smile, sharing moments with her while celine and jesse share moments with each other, made viewing these movies all the more meaningful.  i can't wait to share a glimpse of celine and jesse with her again.",1377561600,,1763,5.118466898954704

2354318,1,B000A2WAEM,This was a terrible movie. It was so boring I couldn't even finish watching it. All they did was talk and the conversation wasn't even interesting. There was nothing wrong with the quality of the DVD; it played fine. It was the actual movie plot--rather a lack thereof that made me regret wasting $8 on this DVD.,1376784000,2,312,4.491228070175438
2354319,5,B000A2WAEM,"I mean sleeper in a good way.  This movie series will probably do better in the DVD market than at the theater.  After learning the premise of Before Midnight, it was recommended that I watch these movies first.  I ordered them and watched them right away.  Then a few days later I watched them again.  If you like love, falling in love, European cities, Ethan Hawke, and Julie Delpy, you will LOVE these movies, too.  What a spectacular display of what mutual falling in love looks like.  Before Sunrise was filmed and 9 years later, Before Sunset was filmed.  It has the same 2 actors and not only are they 9 years older in real life, the story picks up 9 years later in the film.  What a concept!  I absolutely can't wait until Before Midnight comes out on DVD because it left the theater before I could see it.  You've got to see these movies!!",1376784000,,848,4.371794871794871

2354323,4,B000A2WAEM,I liked the interaction between the two.  I wanted to see the final movie but have not been able to.  That way I could see how all three movies relate to each other.,1376524800,,165,3.9696969696969697

2354377,5,B000A2WAEM,"great deal, all the other versions that people bought before, i feel for you all. this is the cheapest price ever  to get both movies on DVD, new and legit of course, it's pure destiny that I was just going to watch some old slightly less quality video files I had and watch these for the third time in my life since high school)(Oh the nostalgia memories of watching these in my apartment on my beat up TV on the patio.....I can't go on anymore) and I did a google search and BAM, the third installment is out, so before I received these dvds I went to watch the new one in Sundance first. I was honestly not really impressed, but following my tradtion I won't watch it until years later, or at least when the dvd comes out. I would hate to watch it again in theater right after watching it the first time, I think the reason I didn't really like it is due to my age not being the age to have kids and being 40s, thus not able to understand the very core of their emotions, although I do feel for them,

these 2 films however, they never get old, because they are about youth.

the answer is in the attempt has manifested itself as part of my living motto for a long time since, it's my personality trademark.

I could really use better image quality though, these DVD look like they come out of tapes from a very old beat up theater. I remember what I bought being DVD high resolution format, these are dvd video regular format . I am pretty sure you can find better video quality but not possibly as good a price as this.

highly recommended if you don't own these movies, this is a great chance to buy them, a great time, pure luck",1374105600,,1635,4.194267515923567

So this is a two-for-one-special-edition-double-feature of movies that are so lovey-dovey romantic that they will make the woman in your life say 'awwww' a lot and definitely bring a tear to her eye... well, to both eyes... unless she only has one eye, in which case that's fine. Far be it for me to say there's anything wrong with a one-eyed female. Unless the eye was right in the middle of her forehead, like that Cyclops guy, 'cause that would look weird. If I only had one eye I'd like to have it on the end of one of my index fingers, 'cause then it would be really handy for looking over walls and around corners and stuff. So where was I? In my living room. No that's not what I meant. God, I've got to stop sniffing this detergent. Oh, yeah, the movies. Well, these movies are are definitely for couples to watch  preferably together  as they will make you feel all fuzzy inside and put a spark back in your loins or back in your lions depending on whether you're in a house or at the zoo.

Basically the plot is this: a couple meet on a train. Then they get off the train, and they walk around foreign cities and talk a lot. It doesn't sound very exciting  and, personally, I think it would have been better if there was an explosion or two  but it is very well done. Eventually the couple become entwined in the same kind of way as when you have two chains around your neck and they get tangled up in each other and you have to unfasten them and take them off to get them apart.

So that's the plot. I don't want to spoil the ending but I will tell you that it doesn't involve alien abductions or any rabbits with pancakes on their heads. They must be saving those things for the the next one. If it's as good as these two it should be well worth watching.",1466208000,,1769,4.188235294117647
