5277969,4,B009911708,"SUSPECT this series will only appeal to people who have watched it first time round on TV. I've waited a long time for this because I like the way Quinn Martin presented the show - Act I, II ... and Epilogue.
I was pre-teens when I watched this on tv and at that time, the FBI were the good guys, untainted by politics or scandal. Maybe that's why the show appeals to me still - reminds me of when the Feds were still regarded by most as decent.
Plots are interesting with occasional shoot-outs.
Think the DVDs so far are the earlier episodes before the narrator explained the FBI's involvement.",1357084800,4,595,4.418181818181818
5277970,4,B009911708,"I have a soft spot for this dry series. No, it's not realistic, but I like it anyway.  I wish they hadn't gone the route of a part one and part two release for each season, which makes the whole venture more expensive, but the DVD sets are good.",1356739200,6,245,4.0

5277972,5,B009911708,"This series is from a time when there was still good quality, decent and entertaining T.V. shows.  A time where networks didn't have the mind set that only T&A, extreme violence (especially against women and children), vulgar language and other types of shows unacceptable to the moral majority are the ""in"" way to go.  I'm by no means a prude but I am so sick of having these type of shows being the only thing available most evenings.  There are a few exceptions where one can still catch a pretty good show, but very few.  Thank heavens for TCM and the availability of good classic movies thereon, The Discovery Channel, PBS, National Geographic to name a few, as well as the availability of shows such as the F.B.I. on DVD.",1349654400,15,727,4.569230769230769

5278023,5,B009911708,This is the second part of the third season of the classic T.V. program.  Like the ones before it this does not disappoint when it comes to action.  The F.B.I. was inspired by actual cases and the programs on the discs here are fascinating and a must have.  You really need both parts and they will not be sitting on you shelf because you will want to watch them over and over again.  Great action with lots of people who also have been big stars in their own right.,1429574400,,466,4.202247191011236
5278024,5,B009911708,This is good stuff!  Classic!  Efrem Zimbalist Jr. played the part perfectly.,1410566400,,77,5.333333333333333
5278025,5,B009911708,"This series was so popular in the late 60's and I remember the good old days of TV.  Much more simple than today with so many choices available!

Efrem Zimbalist, JR. passed away at the age of 95 today and his death reminded me of this series.  They were filed with action, adventure and in fitting  the scope of the FBI line they also had kidnapping, espionage and murder.  Lots more, naturally.

RIP Efrem Zimbalist, JR.

Most highly recommended as a blast from the past....",1399075200,5,476,4.529411764705882

Although it was filmed several decades ago the quality of the image is wonderful, excellent resolution and sharpness and bright colors. It also gives us a perfect description of the city's environment in those years. Congratulations to the company that reissued the series on DVD and to the company that has put them on sale. I am happy and satisfied with this purchase.",1522022400,,458,5.202702702702703

8537818,2,B009911708,"SEE BELOW ON THE DISCS THEMSELVES: - Bought Season 3,4, 8 and 9 from 2 different resellers - all Seasons had MOD Discs with circular markings, scratches and dark blemishes if you buy inspect all your discs

Though there is no remastering or cleanup of any kind (to the best of my knowledge although one season shows Dolby mono but not the others best I can tell), the plain film transfers are quite good. Our Blu-ray/DVD player did a great job on the output presentation with very minimal if any noticeable noise or artifacts even on a 78"" screen where just about every anomaly appears . The picture format was also set to 16:9 vs 4:3 ratio which also maintained very enjoyable (albeit slightly stretched) watching quality. Optimally we set our audio receiver to ""Mono"" which is a match for the audio output on these discs. The audio was not muddy and rather clean but of course it lacked much dimension. Both the music score and voice could be heard clearly without strain (we have a Denon receiver 5.1 sound). Additionally I had also performed an additional satisfactory test by playing one DVD (disc 1) on our computer (non Blu-ray) to a 50"" plasma TV screen and it too appeared quite good as well as the audio which was listened to via good quality closed ear (non ear buds) headphones.
Setting the performances and episodes aside (which I would rate between a 3.5 and 5), all things considered, this would get a 5 star on the straight film transfer to digital on Warner Brothers part. Perhaps for the small ransom they are asking though, surely something else could have been included such as bonus material, interviews, outtakes and so on as with the Quinn Martin ""Invaders"" series where Roy Thinnes has multiple introductions and the unedited pilot was included. The FBI film transfers show minute bits of dust, scratches and other anomalies only on rare occasion. The color prints held up quite well without any noticeable fading or color degradation overall. If you have an audio receiver I'd suggest flipping through your sound modes and check out the mono option if it exists. Overall I would certainly recommend this Season 9 except for the MODS - continue reading.

UPDATE: The packaging itself is a different story. Since we all don't play the disc right away I opted after a few days to inspect all the discs and found markings on Disc 1,2, 5 and 6. Well it gets worse from here. I ordered Season 9 with two damaged discs. Season 4 all seven discs had fine small scratches, two had blotch stains. Season 3 all but one disc had markings. one was acceptable, the others all had small scratches and or circular markings. These MOD discs are unacceptable especially at this price. It's hard to blame the reseller. Season 3 and 4 I had ordered from deepdiscount.com, a different vendor though they resell here on Amazon also. It's difficult to buy another FBI disc until WB remedies this issue. I have written to them with my receipts and evidence of purchase and photos. They have agreed to replace season 8 and 9. Awaiting a reply for Season 3 and 4. I've included a sample image of what you can expect with these discs. I am confident this is clearly a handling issue at the WB plant where they are burned and packaged.",1471046400,,3232,4.648601398601398
