8193393,2,B0002TVV48,This video works. I'm quite surprised seeing how it was filthy...  Had sticky stuff all over the cover and on the disc.  Very disappointed that someone would sell it without at the very least wiping off the sticky stuff.,1467158400,,220,4.615384615384615
8193394,4,B0002TVV48,"I like this video a lot.  Sometimes the way they talk in these type videos can be a bit cheesy but I enjoy the exercises and pace of them.  I don't really use the cardio section as I didn't enjoy them as much but I really like the upper, lower, core and stretching sections.  I find the stretching section to really just be focused on stretching/relaxing. Some other videos I feel like the stretching sections tend to be more of a workout than a focus on stretching the muscles. I really like the upper body section and it's nice that you can mix it up with different weights. Also the core section has some great easy exercises but there are a few that you can feel really deep.",1424304000,,679,4.2890625
