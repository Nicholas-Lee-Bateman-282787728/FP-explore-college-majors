8445429,4,B004WOAGF4,"Other than a couple of flatulence jokes and a brief appearance by a child with unsightly teeth, there is really nothing offensive to be found in this film about a young boy's unlikely adventure to help his brother. The narrative is simple, yet has surprising depth and is oddly plausible. The performances range from adequate to quite good, and after a few minutes the fact that the film is dubbed is hardly noticed since the dialog is generally crisp and free from long stretches of sustained commentary. I am giving it a four out of five, but other than the lead in to this review am finding it difficult to cite any obvious flaws with the film. There are even a couple of catchy songs which may or may not be close to the original Dutch lyrics. This movie was in regular rotation for our little one on Netflix, and we decided to go ahead and buy it after it was removed from the streaming service.",1387929600,2,900,4.427710843373494

This is one of those stories that could be told on stage, in a book or on film. Great family movie, we all love it. Max is very determined and bold..",1345852800,4,261,3.8518518518518516
