8672176,4,B00MH26NEG,"I am always wondering how many movies i might like when i buy a multiple set. I am SOOOO glad i purchased this set! I have watched Identity, Perfect Stranger and Lodger and they all were GREAT! If you like psychological thrillers, multiple twists and turns and Halle Berry at her seductive best, you will love these movies. A great buy indeed!",1454544000,,343,4.548387096774194
