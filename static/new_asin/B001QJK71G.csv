8335904,5,B001QJK71G,"Also known as ""A West Texas Children's Story"" (2007).

This movie is different -- and captivating.  There is an odd distance between the adults and the children, and yet I felt inspired to try even harder to be the best parent I can be.  The main characters are wonderful and the movie very enjoyable.  Get it while you can!

Unfortunately, this movie is very hard to find.  Apparently it was only released in Brazil and not in the US, despite featuring US actors and dialog.  I can report an excellent experience with seller hidef-brazil, and would not hesitate to order from them again (you can see my recent feedback on the seller's page).  The DVD has stereo audio tracks in English and Portuguese, and subtitle tracks in English, Portuguese, and Spanish.

The disc works in my Sony DVD player, my Apple external USB ""Superdrive"" DVD reader/writer, and my MacBook Pro's built-in optical drive, but I did have an issue once: my very first use of the disc was in the Apple Superdrive, and it resulted only in a lot of drive seeking noises until I finally ejected the disc.  The second and subsequent insertions in the same drive have worked fine, and the issue did not occur at all with the other two devices.  The disc is clearly brand-new; it may have been an isolated issue with that particular drive.  It appears that the disc is region-free, because the Handbrake application puts out the message ""DVD disk reports itself with Region mask 0x00c00000. Regions: 1 2 3 4 5 6"".",1496620800,,1480,4.65

8335906,5,B001QJK71G,"This quality of the cinamatography and the soundtrack to this movie were both excellent. You feel as if you are riding along with the characters on their cross country trek from Texas to Maryland. This is an odd movie in that the two main characters are kids, which means many adults might avoid watching it, however, their is a good deal of profanity and sexual themes which means that it is definitely not a kids film. The other dicotomy is that the acting by the two main characters is excellent and realistic throughout, however, the adults they meet along the way are all mere charicatures. Perhaps they are meant to be adults as seen through the eyes of a 12 year old. The film has a heavy adult theme, but the journey itself is done more on a fantasy level. This film would probably have recieved multiple oscar nominations if it had been portrayed from the adults point of view. But this treatment, dealing with evil and an adult world from a kids level does lighten up the theme to a point where it can be comfortably dealt with by the audience without sacrificing any of the emotional intensity. This film draws you into the lives of the characters and will have you caring about the outcome of their trials and tribulations, and their ability to make their own lives and so the world as a whole a little better.",1250899200,11,1322,4.5125
8335907,1,B001QJK71G,"Strictly for AnnaSophia Robb fans. In all other respects this is a bomb of the first magnitude. Absurd story line, poor technical production. It's a wonder this film didn't kill AnnaSophia's career before it really got off the ground. Good thing it was never released in the U. S. Makes you wonder about her management, since this is not the only stinker of a film she's been in. Somebody needs to find better scripts for her, and except for Bridge to Terabithia, so far it is not happening.",1239321600,4,491,4.590909090909091
8335908,5,B001QJK71G,"Although this film has never truely been recognized as a real accomplishment due to a lack of publication, it is a real gem.

This film combines the talent of two extraordinary child actors (Boyd, Robb) with an ansemble of senior acting elites such as Matthew Modine and Val Kilmer. This movie (although the cover suggests it) it not kid oriented. It is a very real exploration into pre-teen psyche and a reflection of adult life. This movie was astounding.

As I mentioned, this movie has been around for nearly two years but the only place the DVD was released was in Brazil. It is fortunate that we are able to obtain it from this seller for a fair price. The shipping was first-rate which was more than expected. And although the cover might be in Portugeuse, the movie can be watched in English.

All in all, I was very satisfied with the service and the movie and I hope that this will encourage you to buy it.",1236038400,11,916,4.473053892215569
