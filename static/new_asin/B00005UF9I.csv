1665214,5,B00005UF9I,"I was going through the TV when i came across the Cartoon Network when I saw a blue dog (Rockafeller i think his name is) along with a mastiff and a Scottish terrier. I was like ''this must that samuri cartoon'' I wacthed it and I fell in love with it. It was the premier of  SJ that night and i watched the encor presentation. It was the best cartoon I had seen in a long time. I like DBZ but I have lost interest in it basically. Samuri Jack is naive but not as much of an airhead as Goku, Gohan or Vegeta can be on DBZ. Don't get me wrong. Last year's season of DBZ with Cell was great but this year's seaon was pretty slow. They could have gone without Goten( Gohan's little bro) who was as annoying as heck. This season was fine but Samuri Jack is the best! Justic League (the remake of the Super Friends) is great too. Also SJ is played by a guy named by Phil, which is my name. SHweet! My mom saw this show and she liked it! I hope this is a many episode series.",1017705600,,969,3.943877551020408
1665215,5,B00005UF9I,"The things that hooked me on this series were:
> the art - gorgeous asian-themed (but at the same time early 70s retro!) backgrounds, plus breathtaking action scenes
> the pacing - unlike Dexter's Lab or Power Puff Girls, there's a lot of silence and letting things happen - much like a Japanese (live-action) samurai film or comic
> the humor - like Jack's reactions when he encounters the dogs and has drinks with them - I mean, they're dogs!
The movie looks to be what I watched as the first three episodes of the series (I just got the alert and I'm ordering it today).  A caveat, the talking dog plot is a bit weak, most of the other episodes are better.  But the incredible zillion-to-one fight against the robot beetles is totally on.  (I wouldn't recommend Jack for young kids because of the frequent slicing up of opponents, regardless of whether they turn out to be robots, plus the pacing might be too slow.)
The first episode has one of my favorite moments so far.  It's the long scene that summarizes Jack's growth and training - notice the seamless transitions from one experience and culture to the next.  Just beautiful.",1016496000,3,1136,4.603960396039604
1665216,5,B00005UF9I,"My title says it all. This is one of the most original shows to come out in a long time. The mix of mythology, science fiction, sword play, as well as the unique animation style and wide screen/split screen presentation make every episode an enjoyable experience. Genndy Tartartkovsky has surpassed all of his work with this show. As the DVD has not been released, I don't own this item yet, but I will be receiving it as soon as it is released, if for nothing but the bonus episode. Any fan of anime, classic Tex Avery/Bob Clampett/Chuck Jones animation, fantasy, sci-fi, and/or martial arts should do themselves a favor and pick this DVD up!",1015372800,2,643,4.649122807017544

1665218,5,B00005UF9I,"Movie Summary:  One young man leaves his village and goes on a quest to become a samurai warrior. He has many adventures each one helping him to grow in strength, honor, humility, and courage. Finally the young samurai reaches a level of enlightenment and is able to obtain the use of a powerful magical sword. With sword in hand he returns home. There he finds that an evil shape-shifting wizard named Aku has enslaved the land. His family and friends suffer under Aku's evil rule. Enraged, he confronts the evil Aku. They battle and at the moment of the samurai's victory, Aku is able to cast a spell that flings the samurai far into the future. There in a strange land far from home, the people call the young samurai ""Jack"". Now Jack must find a way to get home to save his village. It won't be easy as Aku has a long reach and dogs Jack's every move. But Jack is pure of heart and clear of mind and he will prevail.
My Opinion:  Samurai Jack is a Cartoon Network original. It has a very cool and original style that includes excellent animation, rocking music, awesome action, minimal dialog, and innovative split screen scenes. I was very surprised to find something this cool on TV. I thought that it must be an old show that I somehow was unaware of. I was even more surprised to find out that it is new!  Samurai Jack is an ongoing series on Cartoon Network. This DVD contains the premiere episodes. Jack is an extremely cool character. He is tough, smart, and kind. The show has a lot of science fiction elements blended in with the historical samurai elements. It mixes in old myths with its new ones. It also blends intelligent storylines with intense action. It does all of this seamlessly. The stories are creative and interesting. The visuals are very cool. At face value, Samurai Jack is very exciting and extremely entertaining. The action is amazing and Jack is a great hero. Samurai Jack is destined to become a classic.
What You Should Do:  You should buy this DVD and tune into Samurai Jack on Cartoon Network. This is an awesome and extremely entertaining show. If you like action movies, animae, or both, you are sure to find Samurai Jack to your liking.

Starting with Episode one where there is no more then 5 minutes of dialogue and the rest explains why ""Sammy Jack"" (as I like to call him) is such an amazing Samurai.
Episode two shows his troubles with dealing with the future and leads into one of my favorite episodes, number three, where he helps the ""dog people"" against Aku's minions.",1009843200,,622,4.464912280701754

1665301,4,B00005UF9I,"Cartoon Network shows tend to be very, very cool -- at the very least, fascinatingly weird. But their most ""righteous"" show has to be ""Samurai Jack,"" a dryly hilarious show with a righteous hero, his magic sword, and a truly loathsome villain.

""Samurai Jack: the Movie"" is nothing new, merely the first few episodes of the series. Nevertheless, it's a good introduction to anyone who is just checking out this clever little series.

The evil Aku (Japanese for... ""evil"") has risen again, and lays waste to Japan. But the empress manages to smuggle away the young prince, and over the years he becomes a brave warrior. He returns, frees the enslaved people, and goes off to kill Aku with a magic sword forged by the gods.

But during the battle with Aku, the young samurai is flung thousands of years into the future (think a grimier ""Jetsons""). Aku rules the future with an iron fist, and the world is full of volatile aliens, speeding aircars, and talking dogs. Now the samurai -- known as ""Jack"" -- must free the enslaved dogs from Aku's rule, and find a way back to his own time so this future will never happen.

Of course, he won't find it right away, because otherwise there wouldn't be a story. There's a bonus episode in the extras menu: Jack walks over a miles-long bridge, and encounters a psychotic Scotsman who ends up getting handcuffed to him. Will they escape backwater bounty hunters together, or strangle each other first?

Certainly ""Samurai Jack"" isn't like anything you've seen before, with its simplistic drawing style and clever scripting. The animation style is reminiscent of classical Japanese artwork, and their movies get a nod in the quiet, relatively slow pacing of the episodes.

And as it entertains you with evil robots and shapeshifting demons, it also throws in a subtle message about honor, kindness, and ""righteousness."" For a series with no character development, its hero is a pretty lovable guy. He's morally upright, righteous and kind, but somehow it isn't annoying.

And it's fairly cool to see him training with Vikings, Olympic wrestlers, Cossacks, Zen monks, and even with Robin Hood.  And when he gets to the future, we get to see him deal with all sorts of bizarro things. (Robot alligators with machine guns?)  And surprisingly, Jack adjusts very quickly to his surreal new surroundings.

Though it has nothing that people with the other ""Samurai Jack"" DVDs won't have, ""Samurai Jack: the Premiere Movie"" is a good intro for people who are just getting introduced to this clever series.",1149724800,9,2535,4.874418604651162
1665302,3,B00005UF9I,Samurai Jack - The Premiere Movie focuses mainly on the origin of our favorite Samurai and while it was enjoyable it did feel just a little slow.  Overall if you just want to see if you might like Samurai Jack  pick it up.  I'm sure it will hook you.,1125532800,,250,4.061224489795919
1665303,3,B00005UF9I,"This is the story of the beginings of Samurai Jack (also on the 1st season DVD). I like the episodes of young Jack, however I think the best intro to the cartoon would be a later episode. These early episodes have an early timing, animation and story telling style that is not yet up to the level of the other episodes of the 1st season. You can really tell this when Jack first goes to the future and fights the robotic bugs. More importantly though I didn't see these episodes untill after I was a fan from later ones. I found that discovering the Samurai's past after I knew the character was presumably more exciting than the other way around. The DVD has some Cartoon Network online extras if that interests you. I have both this DVD and the 1st season, but there really isn't a need for this DVD unless you don't want the entire 1st season or if you just want this for the completeness of your collection.",1115164800,13,911,4.364705882352941

1665305,3,B00005UF9I,"This dvd isn't so bad; but it's just the first 3 episodes of Season 1. The 'never seen before episode' is the 11th episode (the one with the Scottsman on the bridge), which is also on the Season 1 dvd. It's disappointing that they don't tell you that on the description anywhere, so for any of you who planned on getting both this and the Season 1 set - just get the Season 1 set by itself.

Otherwise, this is a fine intro to Samurai Jack and is worth watching. I would rate the disc 4.5 out of 5 on its own.",1106438400,287,509,3.9901960784313726
1665306,5,B00005UF9I,"Samaurai Jack is an oddly wonderful cartoon series from Cartoon Network and Gennady Tartakov (of Dexter's Lab fame). It is like nothing you've ever seen on television before.

The textures and care that have gone into producing visuals are really remarkable in that they combine a faintly Japanese theme with the very deliberate pacing of a Kurosawa film. For a somewhat violent action cartoon, there is a lot of silence: long stretches in which there is no dialog. The violence is stylized, the characters are fresh. In the series, episodes have developed strong moral themes (including morally ambiguous themes), pastiched various film styles, and all this while wildly entertaining any four year olds hanging around the house.

The premiere movie sets the stage for all this and contains slight more dialog, on average, than most episodes. Still, it is amazing to watch. A revelation if you've not seen SJ before. Here's a disk you've got to own.",1097798400,3,949,5.038216560509555

1665333,5,B00005UF9I,"I recently was flipping through the channel and captured (no captivated) by the Samurai Jack Cartoon on The Cartoon Network.  The style was nothing short of mesmerizing, amazing, and (insert another thousand adjectives here).  While talking with another fan of the series where I worked, I jumped online to see if there was a Boxset of the season or anything else.  I came across this and just by looking at the technical specifications was cautious, but ordered it any (speed shipping in fact).
  I popped it in the DVD Player the very first chance I got.  I WAS BLOWN AWAY.  For the duration of the 70 minute feature, I was paralyzed.  I watched in awe as the style and story sucked me in.  The art was amazing despite the simple look and very well directed.  When the story took the step into the future, I saw how original this series was and how creative the makers truely were.  It was Akira Kurisawa meets The Fifth Element.
  The one aspect of the disc that I was the most impressed with was the superb sound design.  The Dolby Digital 5.1 soundtrack rivals some of the best sounding DVD I have in my collection.  The score entrances.  The Ambient sounds sweeps from speaker to speaker as the camera weaves in and out of the action.  The noise reduction adds a ton (literally) of tension in the quite moments before the nothing short of epic battle sequences.
  For the price, you have to get this DVD if you're a fan or not.  If you've never seen the show, trust me in saying it's worth the buy.  If you're young or young at heart, it will carry you away.  If you're a fan of Stylized directing, it will inspire you.  Everyone should enjoy this DVD.",1071878400,9,1658,4.453333333333333

SAMURAI JACK is chock full of great stories, superbly original animation, and cooly kinetic action that most major film releases lack.

The extras are great.  You get a bonus episode (selected from later in the season), a documentary with the creator and a few others, such as the voice actors, and even the Archives which show how it developed, from rough drawings to story boards to TV (with music from the cartoon in the background).
If you are a fan buy it.  If you're not a fan, watch a few episodes on TV and decide if you want to be a fan.

1665338,5,B00005UF9I,"Samurai Jack stands out as one of the most brilliant cartoons of all time. The color palette oozes will complexity and character. After reading some criticism of the graphic flat style of the film, I wonder if some even realize that it was intended that way for visual punch. Visually, I think Samurai Jack has reached a level of genius that has not been reached is a long time. I realize that the style may not suit some and that is their prerogative, but understand that this cartoon is extremely well thought out.
I do agree with some criticism that it is VIOLENT, and I probably won't allow my kids to see it until later. However, Cartoon network has never marketed it for a younger demographic. At the same time, I feel that it has a greater moral message than 97% of the [stuff]that Disney [puts]out....
The general storyline of Samurai Jack, albeit not terribly complex is eclectic and always refreshing. It has the consummate blend of humor, drama, and action.
All in all, this is a must have for andy art student at the University level that is interested in color theory, graphic design, painting, animation, or figure drawing.",1058313600,,1137,4.69
1665339,5,B00005UF9I,"Check out this series if you can't stand anime. Like the samurai of legend (if not reality), Jack keeps his violence carefully controlled and (so far) has never had to kill anyone in order to pursue his goal. And, while these introductory episodes can be quite intense, the violence presented is neither romanticized nor gratuitious, and impacts all concerned -- including Jack -- in ways that are forever life altering.
This series is especially recommended for students of martial arts and ethics, those familiar with warrior codes throughout history, fans of mid-century art and world music, and anyone who never laughs at the good guys.
Jack is drawn and performed as an adult, human male (his resemblence to Mifune has been mentioned on occasion). Teenagers rarely show up, and when they (or younger children) do, their interactions with the adults are believable and appropriate. Jack is no anime elf, and his beauty and complexity echo far more the best of classic comics and classic films. Despite the seemingly simple animation (which must be seen in motion to be best appreciated) he is far more complex and well-developed a character that those found in far more design-heavy animation.
I'd personally place the age limit around ten, but Jack, and the show, have brains, and his quest is noble and his heart is pure. What's not to love?",1058140800,,1347,4.964601769911504

This is just the story of a hero, that anyone can be sympathetic with. Good action, incredible story, excelent episodes, great extra features for the P.C. or Mac. The animation proposal is art. Learn to apreciate. Please watch the interviews with Gendy Tartakovsky. A mythical experience, the struggle between good and evil. Aku... is Aku (evil)... a great villan for ages to come. Jack is the hero, and a legend to live and fight Aku for as long as he stands. Watch this !",1042848000,3,592,4.757281553398058
1665361,5,B00005UF9I,"Samurai Jack is pure, cartoon action goodness. Very much an experimental work, it blends elements from Hollywood cinema, Japanese sword films, and classic animation into a seamless whole. There is literally nothing else quite like it out there. As another reviewer commented, Samurai Jack is the very reason why we have animation.
The DVD format really shows the quality in this program. Many times, one is struck by the simple beauty of the animation used in this series, especially the backround images. And the sound design on the program is some the best two-channel sound design I have heard. The fantastic music and directional sound effects really underline the ambiance of this program. If you have a Pro-Logic or Pro-Logic II receiver, you are in for a real aureal treat with this disc.
In addition to the premiere movie on this disc, you also get one of the best episodes of the ongoing series, Jack and the Scottsman! In short, if you enjoy the art of animation, this is a must-have DVD.",1041552000,15,998,4.808139534883721
1665362,5,B00005UF9I,"Everytime I see Samurai Jack, whether on TV or video, I am consistently amazed. This truly is graphic storytelling at its finest- action-packed, funny, and visually stunning. Everything in this film is steller, from the premise to the characters to the richly textured world it creates. I recommend this film to anyone who enjoys a good story told in a dynamic and unique way. You won't regret buying this. Ever.",1038614400,,412,4.9
1665363,5,B00005UF9I,"""Samurai Jack"" is the best of both worlds.  Like ""Rocky and Bullwinkle,""  ""Samurai Jack"" has no problem treading the gap between kids cartoons and more mature animation.  The story is straight adventure, easy to grasp and fun to watch.  The dialog is funny, clever and insightful.  The animation is an excellent amalgamation of Japanese and American styles.  It makes use of every innovation, every benefit of telling a graphic story in a fluid medium and combines that with an exciting and fun story.  There is no pretension here, no obvious aspiration to art, just a good time.
This DVD has both the original ""Samurai Jack"" movie and an extra episode.  Both are inspired storytelling with lots of laughs and adventure.  I'm glad that the cartoon network took the bold step to make ""Samurai Jack.""  It can be thought of as a boy's version of ""The Powerpuff Girls.""
 There are some things that can be done with a cartoon, that just can't be done with live action.  In short, ""Samurai Jack"" is the very reason why we have animation.",1038182400,13,1031,4.730337078651686
1665364,3,B00005UF9I,"First let me start of by saying that I am a lover of all things samurai, have been since I was about 8 or 9, so I guess I came into this movie a pretty positive prejudice to the look of this cartoon and subject matter that it would deal with.  But having said that I was completely overwhelmed but just how cool and inspiring this movie was.
This is one innovative piece of animation both in terms of visuals and equally important the audio track.  Samurai Jack's animation is highly stylised but still visually very gripping.  This is perhaps best illustrated in the sequence detailing Jack's training in the ways of the warrior.  Also of note are the way shots are framed to add emphasis to the action.  For example the shift from a full screen shot to a tight letter-boxed close up of say Jack's face to add emphasis to a shot.  Those close-up on Jack's facial expression and his reaction to the often baffling events in the world around him really reminded me of the classic samurai cinema of Kurosawa or say the Lone Wolf & Cub movies.
The battle sequences, especially the battle versus the armies of droids, also are indebted to samurai cinema.  As several other reviewers have pointed out this is a very violent movie.  I sometimes wonder how it gets a PG rating when there are quite graphic shots of Jack beheading and the bisecting his foes where the camera lingers on the remains spurting oil / miscellaneous liquids into the air as Jack poses heroically while drenched in the same vile liquid.
But the thing that really drew me into the show perhaps more than anything was the music and the dialogue (or lack there of).  Jack is definitely the silent stoic type, I think there are maybe a dozen lines of dialogue in the first twenty minutes of the film.  When the spoken word is absent however the fantastic score kicks in.  Described quite rightly by the music coordinator as having a ""world beat"" feel it blends traditional oriental sounds, like Taiko drums and bamboo flutes, with beats producing a sound that adds that something else to the setting and the feel of the animation, especially during the battle scenes.
The voice acting is also great with Mako, marvellous as the villainous Aku and Samurai Jack's ""young oriental Clint Eastwood"" voiced superbly by Phil La Marr with pithy comments abound.
The second bonus episode on the DVD is priceless. The exchange between Jack and the Scotsman is a classic movie moment and the imagery of the bridge itself is delightful
Overall I would recommend this to any fan of samurai movies and manga and to any child with a sense of adventure, providing they can handle the violence.",1034899200,6,2641,4.6338329764453965
1665365,1,B00005UF9I,"I usually do not read the rates for the movies, but this time I thought that I should had read the rate before renting this movie. I am not easily surprised with violent movies, but Samurai Jack is extremely violent. This movie is rented and sold without a rate, but at least it should be P13. The movie is really original, but very violent. You can see characters beeing cut in half with a sword, some of them bleeding profusely. If you are getting this movie, you should watch it before your kids do.",1033257600,2,502,4.351063829787234

1665367,5,B00005UF9I,"Samuri Jack is the best cartoon on television right now.  The episodes are cinematic and very artistic.

1665368,5,B00005UF9I,"I waited and waited to see this film, as I'm a collector of Samurai films as well as a martial arts student/teacher. (I've been in Martial Arts for over 27 years now - Tae Kwon Do, Hapkido, Ninjitsu/Jijitsu, Judo, Karate, Tai Chi, Kook Son Wul, Shotokan, Kung Fu, Kenpo, etc...) I also collect books and movies like ""Lone Wolf and Cub/Shogun Assassin/Babycart Assassin/Babycart to Hades/etc...""
This Samurai Jack movie is really good. It actually portrays the Code of Bushido in the proper way (for an animation film). I was quite suprised. What also surprised me was who does Jack's voice - Phil LaMarr, the comedian. Who would have thought?! To end, I highly recommend this one and hope that Genndy Tartakovsky puts all 36 half hour episodes into a DVD box set, as I will SURELY buy it!",1030406400,2,788,4.717391304347826
1665369,4,B00005UF9I,"Nobody would mistake this for Dexter's Lab. Tartavosky's minimalist and stylized animation highlight this entertaining cartoon amalgamation of The Seven Samaurai and fantasy films. The production design and animation really are the highlights of this imaginative epic. The story is certainly entertaining (and imaginative) enough as well but the lack of character development hobbles SJ from becoming a 5 star classic.
Nevertheless, Taravoksy's startling use of colors, multiple angles within one frame recall both Sergio Leone and Kurosawa all within the same shot. SJ is about as far removed from traditional America (or even Japanese anime)as those two film directors are removed from Hitchcock. Nevertheless, the stunning visuals and narrative overcome many of the minor flaws in this film. Hopefully both Tartavosky and Cartoon Network will continue to push the boundaries of traditional animation in this fashion.
A vivid and worthwhile animation epic that manages to hold its own with live action film.",1030147200,4,1009,5.601307189542483

1665371,5,B00005UF9I,"While most cartoons in America are either built episodic or used for minimal entertainment, Samurai Jack really stands out. The first thing you'll notice is that the artwork doesn't try to be cute or big. It's just...art. It's like one of those paintings with curved lines comes to life. The other elements that make SJ great is it's berserk action. While Powerpuff Girls is only martial arts, this series isn't afraid to use a sword or hack off some limbs. The violence is mostly on robots and is on par with Transformers violence.
The movie itself was shown on Cartoon Network in August. On Cartoon Network, this is re-shown as Samurai Jack The Trilogy, since it makes up the first three episodes. These three episodes set the stage of what you can expect to happen later on. The bulk of the movie has Jack defend a group of talking dogs from bettle robots. The movie is pretty impressive to watch, especially with the addition of 5.1 audio. It also comes in Spanish, but with no subtitles, your on your own to figure it out.
The extras are pretty good as well. You get a SJ Documentary (which was shown in it's entirety after the premiere on CN), a bunch of conceptual drawing and a bonus episode. You'd expect the bonus episode to be episode 4 since it goes in order with the movie, but SUPRISE, it's not, which is great since most people say series only get better later on. The bonus episode introduces Jack's newest Scottish ally.
Overall, if you like action, art and generally a good plot that you can enjoy with everyone (and I mean EVERYONE, including teens), then pick this flick up. You won't regret it.",1024272000,4,1615,4.572413793103448

Samurai Jack is not only funny, extremely cool, beautiful beyond belief and action packed, but it's also the show that pushes saturday morning cartoons into a new and glorious era. This is a show from cartoon network, that doesn't rely on silly cartoon noises or exadurated expressions.
It knows the pace that suits the moment.
So a quiet moment can be filled with cinematic beauty and dignified grace, and likewise the action moments become intense fast paced adrenalin rushes of sword bashing samurai frenzy. Samurai Jack switches between them effortlessly. It deserves 5 stars for it's originality alone.

1665375,5,B00005UF9I,"This is the pilot episode to Samurai Jack. The one where you find out who Samurai Jack is, how he becomes a legendary warrior and his attempt to stop the plight of the demon, Aku (which translates out to ""Evil"" in Japanese).
Jack tries to destroy Aku, and is flung into the future. After adapting (sort of) he attempts to hunt down his immortal enemy in a new, dimensionally-active earth, and/or tries to find a time-portal back home. Also includes a bonus episode where he first meets ""The Scottsman"".
Unlike most of Genndy Tartakovsky's ""Cute"" series like ""Dexter's Lab"", and the ""Power Puff Girls"" (although PPGs have their moments), Samurai Jack is rather serious. He does have some humor sprinkled in, but in the end, it's usually Jack, his Katana (sword), and some big-bad from the underworld/another dimension/ etc...
Samurai Jack is voiced by Phil LaMarr, who does an awesome job of making Jack sound like a quiet, slightly-accented Samurai. On the other side of the fence, is Mako who voices ""Aku"". Aku the demon has a deep, gravelly voice that Mako does very well! Both were casted perfectly in my opinion.
However, Samurai Jack isn't for those who like life-like graphics... the pictures on the front cover are pretty much indicative of the series. The real gold of this series is the plot-lines, and just how cool Jack is. If you like sword-fighting, honorable heroes and maybe sci-fi flicks, this is your series!",1019692800,3,1425,4.844262295081967
1665376,5,B00005UF9I,"Since everyone else has given a summary of the DVD, I just want to give my impressions.  We first saw a preview of Samurai Jack at the San Diego Comic-Con, July 2001, with Genndy Tartakovsky doing a question/answer session afterwards... everyone there was floored by how good this was, and it was shown on a large projection screen (not the greatest for clarity)!  We were all salivating afterwards, looking forward to seeing more of Jack.  Genndy is a true artist and genius, and it shows in every episode.  If you haven't seen any episodes, you are in for a treat, especially the opening sequence of the first episode.  That was sheer beauty and brilliance.  I could watch that opening over and over and over...
Genndy said how this was a dream of his, to do a samurai-type of cartoon, but with his own artistic flair.  Luckily for us, Cartoon Network gave him free rein to do what his heart desired.  I hope Genndy will be allowed to express his creativity for as long as he lives :-) .",1018396800,3,989,4.51685393258427
