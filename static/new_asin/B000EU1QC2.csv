2534174,5,B000EU1QC2,This is a great show that I hope become full season offers.  The picks from different season on this disk was done in a very interesting way.  They began with the first season and picked episodes along the way until the end of the show.  I love it and watched it twice in the short time I have owned it so far.,1155081600,13,310,3.967741935483871
2534175,4,B000EU1QC2,"I agree. I miss the show, but I'll wait until I can get proper full seasons, thank you.

Same goes for spin city? Who really wants these ""favorites"" boxes?",1154908800,40,155,4.344827586206897
2534176,5,B000EU1QC2,"This is one of my favorites and hopefully it will do well enough so we can get season sets.  This is 6 episodes of the show from throughout the run, and they all are full of cheesy goodness that made TGIF what it was, and they are great for nostalgia as well as for new viewers.  Patrick Duffy stars, and anything with him is basically made 10 times greater than it would have been without him.  The rest of the cast is great too, go buy and enjoy.",1151193600,3,448,4.068181818181818
2534177,5,B000EU1QC2,"First, I would like to make a comment to fans of this show. BUY THIS RELEASE!!! Do not wait for season sets. The purpose of this release is to test the market for season sets. If this sells well, we will see season sets very soon. If it doesn't sell, we will probably never see season sets.

THE ONLY CHANCE THAT WE FANS HAVE FOR SEASON SETS IS TO SUPPORT THIS DVD.

Now, about the show: During the 90s, ABC produced many great family friendly sitcoms such as Home Improvement, Boy Meets World, and Full House. For some reason, this gem is often overlooked. This show featured a great cast of veteran TV stars including Suzanne Somers (Three's Company), Patrick Duffy (Dallas), Sasha Mitchell (Also, Dallas), and Bronson Pinchot (Perfect Strangers).

The show focused on a Brady-Bunch type blended family. The kids ranged in ages from infant to college-age, and the parents had lots of screen time, so everyone can relate to someone. A great show for families. If you've never seen it, try it!",1150502400,76,993,4.662857142857143
2534178,5,B000EU1QC2,I have been waiting for Step by step to come out on DVD for years. This is at least something but I would really like the whole season. I keep waiting.,1148947200,29,151,3.903225806451613

2534180,5,B000EU1QC2,When are we finally going to get the first full season? I'm sure a lot of people have been waiting for a long time. It seems like they keep putting out shows from around the same time period but they keep over looking step by step.,1144886400,6,231,4.043478260869565

2534196,1,B000EU1QC2,"The show is great. The disc sucked! Brand new, right out of the package, never used, disc wasn't loose inside the case but it came with scratches on it and the disc skips horribly!!! This only has 6 episodes on it, and half of it skips! What a waste!! This was a gift for my husband who enjoys this show so I'm really disappointed that it isn't in perfect condition as a NEW DISC.",1455667200,,380,4.148648648648648
2534197,4,B000EU1QC2,"I've loved this show since I was just a kid, so being able to see some episodes again was a very nostalgic experience. The only reason I gave it four stars was because I wish it had more episodes on it.

Episode List:

Pilot (Debut)

Rules Of The House (Season 1)

J.T.'s World (Season 2)

Christmas Story (Season 3)

I'll Be Home For Christmas (Season 4)

Your Cheatin' Heart (Season 7)

Don't get me wrong, these are all great episodes. I just thought there should have been a few more episodes added to this DVD package. So, all in all, great show; short DVD.",1449187200,2,562,4.336538461538462

2534205,3,B000EU1QC2,For the price and freight paid (to New Zealand) just a little disappointed with only half dozen episodes. Prefer to have just a set of the first series  - that would be worth the freight here.,1435622400,,192,4.333333333333333
2534206,5,B000EU1QC2,"Step by Step (Television Favorites Compilation) is a single DVD with six episodes of Step By Step and no special features. It's a fine way to introduce new viewers to the concept of the show and for fans to see some of their favorites. My wife and I enjoy this show and would enjoy to see full seasons of it released. Rumor has it that WB put this product out to test the waters on releasing full seasons but it didn't make enough cash for them so nothing has been released past this point. One would think that they would do the same thing as Night Court and just release DVD-R seasons to sell on Amazon here so Step By Step fans could finally get full seasons. If you want to see full seasons of this show, contact companies that are still putting out TV shows on DVD, such as Mill Creek Entermianment, Shout Factory, Echo Bridge Home Entertainment and let them know you want Step By Step seasons on DVD. Perhaps they can pick up the copyright from WB or whoever has it.",1435536000,,972,4.288043478260869

I really wish that studios wouldn't release a single season and then leave those of us who love the show forever suspended in the hope that the remaining seasons will be released as well. It ""only"" took a decade or so for the complete series of The Nanny to be released - hopefully other 90s comedy gems like this one will follow suit!",1432684800,,537,4.479591836734694

2534218,5,B000EU1QC2,"Great memories from this show.  Just enough to make you crave the complete series. I'm sure this was a test to see if there was any interest in putting out the complete series.  I don't think it did well because they haven't even released a complete season.

If you haven't watched it, it's in line with a lot of the sitcoms you'd see back in the late 80's and early to mid 90's such as Full House, Saved By The Bell, Family Matters.  I think this compilation is more for those folks who haven't seen the television show and they want to get a good idea of what the show is all about.  Anyway, wait for the full seasons to come out.

The only character's attitude I didn't like was Dana becuase she was so stuck up and judgmental, but overall she gave the funniest lines, especially towards JT(ex. Spud the Potato, Greaseball,etc.). This show was the main reason I stayed in Friday nights, ABC TGIF showed great clean shows in the 90's(Family Matters, Boy Meets World, Mr. Cooper). I wish they would release all 7 seasons of this show on DVD. It is not fair that this show is ignored and there were great actors in this show too. I wonder what all of the actors and actresses of this show are doing now? I want every season of this show on DVD(particularly seasons 6 and 7).

With that having been said, I would like to add a few comments about this show. First, I grew up watching this show on TV, and even into my teen-age years I still watched it. I'm 24 years of age now, and this show still holds one of those ""sentimental-type"" places with me. Despite what many critics have said in the past, this show was truly one of the better shows I've watched on TV.

The show ended back in 1998 after stooping to the lowest ratings it ever recieved in it's 7 season run. Personally, I feel this was due to multiple factors. IMHO, The main factor for the loss in ratings was due to the loss of Cody (Sasha Mitchel, the actor who played Cody ran into some domestic legal problems with his wife, and as a result Disney canceled his character). Without him, the show lost much of what made it comical, and fun to watch. Sure, each character was funny and entertaining in their own way, but it's clear to anyone has seen more than a few episodes of this show that Cody was often the center of the comedy. All the other characters seemed to interact with him to bring life to the script. I feel the producers must of realized this, for they brought Cody back for the next to last episode of the series in season 7, but by then it was too late.

To compensate for the loss of Cody the producers tried to introduce other characters to take Cody's place, such as Flash and JT's best friend Rich (Jason Marsden). While I feel Flash was somewhat cool (especially in the two episodes where the family went to Disney World, and Flash captured the tourist record for USA), still, Flash was certaintly no Cody. The same can be said of Rich, though I feel Rich's character became a positive contribution when he began dating Dana, as it was a pure example of ""opposites attract"", and no one really seen it comming.

Another major reason for the loss of ratings is the actors, as well as the characters they played did what all kids do........they got older! Remember, when the show first began JT and Dana weren't but about 15-16 years of age and Karen was 14. When the show ended all three of these characters were in their 20's. Let's not forget the character Al (Christine Lakin) was only 11 years old when the show began, but was either 18 or 19 when the show ended. Thus, these kids were no longer kids and teen-agers, but were adults at the end of the series. Thats not to say that they were any less entertaining, just the magic that comes from a mom and dad raising their kids was pretty much over. I think this is probably why Brenden's character was phased out, and Lilly's character was added, as the producers were trying to recapture the concept of Carol and Frank being a mom and dad, and trying to raise a family.

One other minor factor for the show's cancelation could be due to the movement of the series from ABC's TGIF line-up to CBS. Remember, it was common for most fans of TGIF to watch all four shows (whatever 4 were on the air at any given time) straight through, and since Step By Step was no longer on the station some people probably didn't bother changing their TV channel during the 2 hour TGIF block, and left their TV's tuned to ABC rather than tuning into CBS.

One final point I would like to note is this: For some odd reason most of the actors and actresses have had next to zero acting careers since this series ended. I'm not exactly sure why this is, but I've always suspicioned this series had something to do with it. From what I've read in online searches it appears the actor Brandon Call (JT Lambert) retired from acting after the series ended, and now owns his own gas station and car wash somewhere in California. It also appears that Christopher Castle (Mark Foster) and Josh Byrne (Brended Lambert) haven't done anything else in the acting buisness since this series ended as well. Even Angela Watson (Karen Foster) hasn't done much acting either, though she has been working for a company that helps prevent child actors from being used for money by their parents.

Perhaps in the future someone will do a documentary, and interview the actors and actresses who appeared on this show to see what everyone has been up to since the series ended. Maybe higher sales of this DVD will provoke someone to do it LOL!",1171756800,10,4498,4.431680773881499

Carol and Frank had multiple year anniversaries in the same season. They were at 2 years in like the first season, which didn't make any sense. Then they jumped from 2 and a half years to 4 years in one season. The outside shots of the house goes from winter to spring from one episode to the next. In season 5, Lily is a baby, like six months old and Jt is 19. Then you start season 6 and Lily is 6 years old and Jt is still 19/20. It just doesn't make any sense.
