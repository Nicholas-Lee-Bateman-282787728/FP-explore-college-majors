4374363,5,B004GZ549W,"How the States Got Their Shapes is a great dvd! It tells the story of how our nation formed geographically -- how it added states and how their borders changed. For instance, did you know there was a state named Franklin for 4 years? Or that Texas had to lose some of its northern border to remain a slave-holding state prior to the civil war? Or that the Louisiana Purchase happened because the Haitians rebelled against the French? There is so much more! This is history that just isn't found in our kids' history books anymore.",1304467200,24,530,4.53125
4374364,5,B004GZ549W,"This was very a  fun DVD. It was full of information about our states. It was quite detailed and extreamly interesting. I think the young and old both will enjoy it. I especally like the part about my home state of Michigan and the story behind how the rivalry between Michigan and Ohio state got started..It also tells where the term ""The Wolverine State"" came from!",1293321600,7,367,4.5606060606060606
4374365,5,B004GZ549W,Love Love having my own copy of this extremely interesting dvd. Its fascinating and would be a great gift for anyone who has an interest in the USA,1319846400,2,147,4.285714285714286
4374366,2,B004GZ549W,"I was really interested to learn that there was a DVD about how some of the crazy state shapes came about, but I was a bit disappointed when I watched it.  I was hoping for a little more in-depth. I guess there was a series or mini-series on TV (there is a ""Season 1"" available on DVD) and this must have been an introduction or an overview.  I was hoping to give it to my father as a gift but his eyesight is failing and it has too much text on the screen at times and moves too fast for him to read it.",1319587200,,504,3.8365384615384617
4374367,4,B004GZ549W,"This is an enjoyable journey into the little known areas of our history.
It is presented with humor. A must see for anyone wanting to delve into
historical trivia.",1317686400,,163,4.655172413793103
4374368,3,B004GZ549W,When you look at this product on Amazon the first image you see is the one that says season one! Yes the other image is there but this product is extremely misleading in terms of what it really is. This is as others have mentioned the 2 hour special. It is a great resource for me to use in my classroom but I really was looking forward to actually being able to use the T.V. Series.,1314662400,3,383,4.052631578947368
4374369,4,B004GZ549W,Great video but it may be the first of this series. One is not really sure what you are ordering as there is no table of contents detailing what program are contained...this is my only criticism. None of this is what is currently being shown on the History network in the summer of 2011 so would like to see a series of these programs put together in some kind of box set by each season it runs. What you have here is very good and I intend to use it in my high school classes. Give us more of this excellent series!!,1312934400,4,517,4.078431372549019
4374370,5,B004GZ549W,Expected the DVD I ordered to arrive in a month's time but instead it was here within days.  Great service.  Very pleased.,1312761600,,122,4.5
4374371,4,B004GZ549W,"I just wanted to clear up some confusion that is apparent from other reviews. This DVD is ONLY the original 2-hour special, which first aired on April 2010. This DVD does NOT include the 10-part series which aired from May 2011 - July 2011.

As far as I can tell, the 10-part series is not available here on Amazon nor at the History Channel website store, but see Ellen Goodman's comment below about it being available at Video On Demand.

Also:
Although this is a very interesting show, it has many factual errors, probably because the book that it is based on is full of errors. You might want to read through the reviews here of the book that the series is based on (same title). That doesn't mean we can't enjoy and learn from the show (or the book), but we should be very cautious about believing everything we think we ""learn"" from the show (or the book). Popular history is full of interesting ""events"" that never actually happened.",1311379200,38,940,4.523529411764706
4374372,5,B004GZ549W,"I ordered this for my son, who is an eighth grade History teacher,after he asked me to tape it off the History channel. I wanted him to be able to use it for many years to come, so i ordered it as a gift for his class room. It's one of the approved SOL videos that he can show in class. He said it was good.",1308355200,,307,3.6666666666666665
4374373,2,B004GZ549W,"While I have always been a history buff, I found this production could be much better if the product did not have music playing loudly while someone was speaking.  I have no idea why the production staff would think that music inhances everything especially when someone is speaking as it was not needed and made it difficult to understand what was being said.  Leave off the drummer and the music and it would be an interesting and informative piece of work.  But for me, I would pass if I knew then what I know now regarding the drums and the music.",1307750400,8,551,4.435643564356436
4374374,2,B004GZ549W,"I love the series since the first time I watched on the History Channel, but the DVD has no indication of any kind if its the whole series or the first couple episodes etc... I believe that the DVD needs more information like 5 of the 10 episodes, or season 1 or volume 1. Anything to let me know what I am getting and what I can get later on",1306368000,45,342,3.9
8429110,5,B004GZ549W,"If you love documentaries, this is fascinating. If not, move along.",1441152000,,67,5.181818181818182

Interesting facts I did not even know as a geography major!",1408233600,,88,4.235294117647059

8429115,5,B004GZ549W,No Haiti ...no Louisiana purchase period..For such a small nation Haiti has made a big impact in the world. This video created an interest for the whole history of Haiti.,1378857600,,170,4.7
8429116,5,B004GZ549W,"Watched the entire series in one very long day in the hospital and I was not bored for one single minute!  Engaging, adorable, fascinating, charming, informative - and cute!  Sure makes you want to travel...!  They say that the one country the French know nothing about is France.  They could say the same thing for we Americans.  What an amazing place we live in.  I had no idea of the enormous range of ways that we all live in these United States.  How lucky we are!  Five great big shiny stars for a GREAT series!!

So happy to see that the series is available for purchase.  Can't wait to share it with my friends!",1351123200,,619,4.350877192982456
8429117,4,B004GZ549W,"Have you ever wondered why Michigan has the U.P.?  Why Oklahoma has its odd ""pan handle""?  Or why many of the western states are so ""boxy""? HOW THE STATES GOT THEIR SHAPES answers these questions, and presents many additional quirky tidbits and factoids associated with the boundaries of our states.  From short-lived states such as ""Franklin"" and ""Jefferson,"" to anomalies such as the Missouri ""boot,"" and the ""Northwest angle""  - this DVD presents a nice bit of ""cocktail party knowledge,"" whetting the appetite of those who are fond of odd facts and historical minutia.
I came across this DVD at my local library, and I'm glad that I gave it a chance.  I look forward to getting my hands on a copy of the 10 part series that subsequently followed this premier.",1342310400,,763,4.75
8429118,4,B004GZ549W,"Enjoyed this very much; anxious to share with my grandchildren
when they visit this summer - excellent teaching tool for kids",1337904000,,125,5.0
8429119,1,B004GZ549W,"This single DVD which is just the 2 hour teaser special and it actually costs more than the 10 episode entire season which also happens to include the same 2 hour special as a bonus on Disk 4.

Do yourself a favor and buy the whole season instead.  It is an excellent series.
