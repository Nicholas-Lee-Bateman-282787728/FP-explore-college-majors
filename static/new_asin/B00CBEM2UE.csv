8579805,5,B00CBEM2UE,"We are working our way through the lectures and are loving the course so far. A really good survey of the museum and of art in general. If you want a complete survey of art history you may want to look elsewhere but as far as getting ready for a big trip to the Met, this video course is great.",1458518400,3,294,3.9166666666666665

8579808,5,B00CBEM2UE,This was great! A thorough journey through an art museum. I loved having the experience of just a few select pieces of art from each section of the museum. And his suggestion on how to visit a museum is really useful.,1415145600,2,217,4.317073170731708
8579809,5,B00CBEM2UE,"The guided tour with Professor Brettell begins with ancient Greece and Rome and continues to Egyptian Art, followed by Asian Art in Part 1 and covers the rest of the world in part 2. The lectures are never boring because the Met has an excellent collection of paintings and sculptures. I have ordered Professor Brettell's lectures of the Louvre in Paris and look forward to that Great Course. I visited the Met in 1958 when I was on my way to Hamburg, Germany as an AFS summer exchange student. I have not seen the Louvre, but was able to visit the Prado Museum in Madrid and El Escorial, which is a short train ride west of Madrid, during a trip to Spain.",1390521600,,656,4.385245901639344
