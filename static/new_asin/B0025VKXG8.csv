3849375,5,B0025VKXG8,"I suppose there are a few people out there who have never heard of the comedy series, Night Court, which ran from 1984 to 1992. But for those unfortunate few, they truly do not know what they are missing.

Night Court broke the usual comic mold. Most comedies are centered around a normal central character witnessing the madness around him or her. With Night Court, everyone is nuts, including Harry Anderson, who plays a judge, a figure society assumes is as solid as a rock.

What made this show so darn funny was clever, well-written scripts, the right combination of identifiable personalities (I mean, who does not know a person like Dan Fielding or Christine Sullivan?), and the choice of actors perfectly suited to match their characters, giving performances of the roles of their careers.

There was also an incredible range in its humor. While most comedy series usually find one level of banality and stay there, the comedy in Night Court covered a greater spectrum. Thus, the humor was sometimes poignant, sometimes philosophical, sometimes slapstick, farcical, or even downright dumb, many times in the same episode. The humor, though, was never boring. The humor was intelligent, smart, ... and just darn funny.

The show never really jumped the shark, even when it easily could. In the eighth season a new character, a ditzy Court Reporter, was introduced. So now there are two comic relief characters in the Courtroom, the Court Reporter and one of the Bailiffs, Bull Shannon (Richard Moll.) While introducing a new character to an established routine is usually fatal to the over-all chemistry of the cast, this new character, through deft comic script-writing, fits right in, adding, not hindering, the comic effect.

Recurring actors include John Astin, of Addams Family fame, Yakov Smirnoff, and Mel Torme, who shows incredible acting flair as Harrys idol.

For all those who have not seen this series, check it out.",1498003200,,1936,5.034375

3849399,4,B0025VKXG8,"Night Court's Seventh Season broke two Cardinal Sins when it comes to television series.  1) A wedding.  2) Pregnancy.  Both of these happen to Christine (Markie Post) during the latter part of the season.  Usually when there's a wedding or pregnancy it's to bump viewership.  These are often last ditch efforts akin to ""jumping the shark"".

Otherwise... Night Court continues to amuse.  John Astin's portrayal of Buddy, Harry Stone's (Harry Anderson) father goes to the point of Buddy moving in and an engagement later in the series.  Yes, it's all in good fun and good fun is had by all.",1467849600,,589,4.82

NC begins in strong steps with a roster of Cast but once the regulars were in place the quality
continued to improve. The style of humour was broad always willing to push the subjects.
Even though humour has gone through many changes I think young viewers will still love
this series and even develop a genuine affection for the Cast.

3849511,3,B0025VKXG8,"Night Court's final solid season would be its seventh, and season 6 was a letdown from season 5.  After season 7 the show would never really recover.

But I had bought seasons 4 and 5 on this MOD title and was... less than impressed.

The price was higher than previous seasons, and a burn on a consumer-grade off-the-shelf disc* was a turnoff.  For the price commanded, a low-grade disc is a ripoff.

Especially as season 4's release had a mastering error with the audio losing sync in one episode, which is not attributable to the master videotapes shot circa 1985 or whenever...

One thing to warn is that the DVDs were transferred [from what it looks like to me] from tapes. So you will see once in a while some garbage on the screen. also noticed some fluctuations in the audio volume.

8351200,5,B0025VKXG8,"I have loved this show since it first aired back in the late 80's! This is what REAL comedy looks like and I recommend this show to everyone looking for a really good comedy to watch! Much of today's comedy TV and movies are crude, flat, dry, and sometimes outright offensive! this show here is the perfect example of what a sitcom is supposed to be. And I prefer the comedy TV shows of the 80's over some of the comedy TV shows of today.",1511654400,,438,4.1647058823529415
