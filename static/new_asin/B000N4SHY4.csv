8174813,3,B000N4SHY4,"Ok. so the interviews are extremely interesting and Bowie as always is prolific, creative, in control and very humorous in his responses. The entire collection of interviews moves along fairly well but unfortunately falls sort of flat during the last 3rd of the film, which involves the press confrence for the Outside album, which frankely goes on for more than 30 minutes and feels rather dull after awhile. Partly due to the camera operator who kept the lens zoomed out and still for nearly the entire duration of the interview, where Bowie is seen at a considerable distance. The Q&A is all very interesting anyway, but it felt like who ever put this compliation of interviews together simply ran out of source material to work with, because everything moves along pretty nicely up until the Outside portion of the DVD, which goes on far too long. I think they should have added one or two more interviews and cut the last one down considerably. I got rather bored going into the 15 minute mark of the last 3rd of this dvd. Still there are some seriously interesting moments on this DVD, not withstanding an interview with Bowie on british TV seated along side Tom Hanks of all people. Still highly recommended, but the last interview is very boring. At least to me it was.",1367712000,2,1277,4.705357142857143
8174814,3,B000N4SHY4,"My big disappointment with this DVD was that the interviews are spread over his entire career (a few from the last couple of years).  Now if you want interviews only from the Ziggy period - as I did - look somewhere else.  The interviews are from various stages of his life, and cover various albums.

That said, it's a worthy addition to the collection of any Bowiephile.  It's interesting to see different sides of him, and he is very entertaining to watch.  So if you're keen on collected interviews that give more insight into the man and his work, you will enjoy this.  I had seen some of these interviews online before, so be warned.  I was really eager to see more of the Ziggy era specifically, which is why I dropped one star on my rating.  The other star was dropped because as a DVD it's very sparse in layout and has no bonus features.  It has a bit of a cheap feel, especially for the price.",1190073600,10,904,4.333333333333333
