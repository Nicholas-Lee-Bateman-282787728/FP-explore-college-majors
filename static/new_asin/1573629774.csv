193733,5,1573629774,This is one of my favorite movies about air problem on a plane. It shows people afraid of flying and what could happen when they take a class to overcome their fear. The cast carries the film alone smoothly and it shows other phobias that people have and their reaction to them.,1377648000,,278,4.365384615384615
193734,4,1573629774,GOOD MOVIE RELATING TO PEOPLE WHO HAVE A FEAR OF FLYING AND/OR A FEAR OF HIEGHTS.  MIX IN AN ATTEMPTED HIGH-JACKING AND MAKES FOR A GOOD MOVIE.  JM,1212192000,,147,4.214285714285714
193735,1,1573629774,"Don't bother making a DVD or VHS purchase of this so-called sequel, the pain will only hurt more! Tom Berenger, Craig Sheffer, and Jennifer Beals make a futile attempt to save this movie, but there efforts couldn't revive it. All of the 747 flying sequences are 'stolen' from the orginal 'Turbulence'and to add insult to fatal injury, the movie questions all aviation intellectuals by showing our heroes walking away from a 737 at the end of the movie. Please... Please... Please... Stay away from the bootlegs, video rentals, and purchases of this flick, wait for TBS, TNT, or the USA network to broadcast it instead!",1140220800,2,618,4.895238095238096
193736,3,1573629774,"I'm sure by the end of this movie the fear of flying class still had even more fear of flying.  In TURBULENCE 2 FEAR OF FLYING, a familiar scenario unfolds; we know that someone on the plane is going to have to fly it and bring it in safely.  This time it falls on the shoulders of Craig Sheffer, who usually plays a bad guy, but this time he's the hero.  Add pretty Jennifer Beals as a claustrophobic, too, and Jeremy Nordling as a despicable bad guy with a phony British accent and you have all the requisites for a hold your breath action movie.

Given the genre has been beat to death, there are some suspenseful moments and some over the top plot twists, but it's tidy enough to keep a viewer interested.  Tom Berenger pops in as the flight attendant, and didn't have to worry about any Oscar nominations for this one!",1101427200,,823,4.318181818181818
193737,2,1573629774,"The first portion of this movie wasn't so bad. And yes, it did touch upon current issues (it was a little eerie at times -- seeing a story about a terrorist taking over an airliner). So what may have seemed over-the-top and silly at the time is now more plausable. Well, a little more plausable, anyway.
I didn't mind the rather absurd premise of this film. I didn't let myself get bogged down, worrying about this technical improbablility and that technical improbability. After all, what do I know about airliners and all the techno-geeky stuff? Nothing! So, I just figured that it was all relatively plausable, and left it at that. So I do not think I was being nit-picky in the least.
I liked most of the characters; they were fine. Likeable. Craig Sheffer made a good hero -- he should play such roles more often. Jennifer Beals is lovely and gave a decent performance. The ""bad guy"" (Jeffrey Nordling) was really good at being evil. Tom Berenger didn't have that exciting of a part (he played the head air traffic controller), but he did very well with what he was given.
Half way through the film, I was thinking, ""This really isn't so bad after all. Not great, but typical B-movie stuff."" And then something SO dumb, SO implausable happened, that even I, in my forgiving and easy-going mood, thought, ""NO WAY."" It all kind of fell apart after that for me. The film could never quite recover from such an embarrassingly stupid plot device. And it didn't.
The ending was...bad. Not so much because of the ""hero landing the plane"" business (we've seen that a million times before and usually accept it) but just because it never could redeem itself after the embarrassingly stupid plot device. Plus, there were portions of the ending were corny, forced -- I cringed in parts. I found myself saying, ""This is a BAD movie.""
Too bad it started to fall apart like that at the end. The rest of the movie was never going to be considered *good*, but it could have avoided being quite so bad had it not taken that fatally stupid turn near the end.",1043280000,2,2045,4.574931880108992

193739,4,1573629774,"I'm probably one of the few people that enjoyed this movie.  It's has a very far-fetched storyline, with tons of holes.  It would have been better if the writer spent a little more time making this more believable.  But for those that like action movies, and can ignore the holes in this story - you'll enjoy it.
This is an interesting story of a ""fear of flying"" class that takes it's first group flight, only to be hijacked.  Sit back and enjoy this one, but don't look for holes in this film, as it is full of them.",1015718400,2,518,4.255102040816326

193741,2,1573629774,"I don't have much to say about this turkey except to watch for one incredible sequence with the terrorist contacting the control tower. The Tower gives the terrorist the usual talk about no negotiations. The terrorist decides he has to show that he means business. But how? His solution? Start tossing people out of the plane. An effective plan right? But that is not enough for this terrorist. He also wants to send a message to the control tower, to express his outrage at their non-cooperation.
So, the terrorist opens the hatch and holds his selected victim inches away from doom. Then, as the plane flies over the airport, he carefully and judiciously calculates wind speed, vector problems, and trajectory so that when he drops the poor sap, the body will rip into the Control Tower like a missile. What a math wizard, he does this all on the fly without aid of a calculator.",998006400,4,881,4.690322580645161
193742,3,1573629774,"I'm a basically an aviation junkie, but I do not really enjoy this movie. When you watch this movie,I  found out that some of the parts are the same as the original Turbulence,and those parts are quite blurry. It is about a  Trans Con Boeing 747 hijacked,with a chemical toxin onboard. It flies  through a storm with the ILS navigational system down. The part I liked most  is when the bad guy opens a passenger door and throws a passenger out of  the plane while it the plane descends to Sea Tac airport for landing. That's  all!",962409600,4,530,4.412371134020619
