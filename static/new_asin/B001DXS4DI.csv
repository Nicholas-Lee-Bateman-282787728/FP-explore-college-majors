3543487,5,B001DXS4DI,"With all the reviews out there, I'll make mine short and sweet.

NIGHT GALLERY ran three seasons. The first two were hour-long episodes and are the best of the series. The third season lacks in both story quality and length, shortened to a half-hour. Universal released the first season on DVD overpriced. The second season, however, is much much better in quality of price and a bonus disc means the studio is actually doing something about their DVDs since they usually release cheap discs and little if anything on extra bonus features. I assume they turned to the authors of the NIGHT GALLERY book regarding the release of this DVD set simply because of the extras. If they did this for other TV shows such as LEAVE IT TO BEAVER and ALFRED HITCHCOCK PRESENTS they'd have a better product and hence, better sales.

If you want companion pieces to go along with the DVD release, I suggest ROD SERLING'S NIGHT GALLERY: AN AFTER-HOURS TOUR by Scott Skelton and Jim Benson offers 390 plus pages of behind-the-scenes critical analysis and facts with exclusive interviews with cast and crew.

If you love The Twilight Zone and other works by Serling, then I suggest
THE TWILIGHT ZONE: UNLOCKING THE DOOR TO A TELEVISION CLASSIC by Martin Grams is 800 plus pages and includes ""everything"" about the classic series. The details about Serling's writing career on radio, early television and Twilight Zone is well researched and highly detailed. Exclusive interviews with cast and crew and behind-the-scenes trivia will floor you.

Both books available on Amazon.com",1226016000,12,1559,4.961685823754789
3543488,5,B001DXS4DI,"Not much to add, to what the other reviewers had to say, but just to add my .02, this is the BEST season of one of the best horror/anthology shows of all time. If you're a Rod Serling fan, or a fan of the Twilight Zone in general, don't hesitate to order this wonderful show. I had never heard of this series before I caught an episode on cable one day, and I was instantly hooked. The tone, and style of this show have rarely been equalled. Excellent storytelling, photography, acting, direction, and most of all, Rod Serling's special touch make Night Gallery a winner.",1225065600,9,571,4.447619047619048
3543489,5,B001DXS4DI,"""Night Gallery"" would often be dismissed by critics because it was the younger brother of ""The Twilight Zone"". That was unfair. Each series had its own unique flavor and sensibility. ""Night Gallery"" benefited from both Rod Serling (who hosted but didn't want to produce any longer due to how overwhelmed he was on ""The Twilight Zone"")and Jack Laird (who did produce the series). As Guillermo Del Toro (""Pan's Labrynith"", ""Hellboy"") points out in one of his commentary tracks the unique blend of their tastes made ""Night Gallery"" a unique fantasy/horror show on TV. There's an odd perception that Serling didn't write many of the epsiodes as well. That's not ture. He wrote well over a third of them and wrote the introductory monologue for every single episode.

You'll note that ""The Sixth Sense"" isn't included here as part of the package and that's because that series was packaged with ""Night Gallery"" for syndication ONLY to flesh out the amount of episodes and make the series something that could be sold for syndication. Serling wrote new introductory pieces for these segments.

Image quality is extremely good although you must keep in mind this is a 30 plus year old show. There wer some minor compression artifacts but on the whole the series makes a smooth and nice transition to DVD. Colors are strong throughout and the mono soundtrack sounds extremely good with the music sounding quite nice as well (and since music WAS an important part of some episodes, this is important as well particularly on key episodes like ""The Caterpillar"" with Eddie Sauter's creepy atonal, percussive music score).

Universal deserves kudos for putting together this deluxe package for ""Night Gallery"" as do Scott Skelton and Jim Benson (co-authors of the definitive book on the series and Benson also hosts the website TV Time Machine--well worth checking out for his insightful interviews)for putting together such a comprehensive package. We get an excellent 30 minute documentary on the series featuring directors such as Jeannot Swarc (Serling's favorite director on the show), John Badham and others discussing the genesis and impact of the series, what Serling and Laird brought to the series as well as what it was like to work on the show. We also get an excellent featurette on Tom Wright's paintings for the show with Wright discussing his approach (he always tried to service the story but focused on the ""feel"" of the script itself). We also get an interactive gallery of about 33 surviving paintings from the show with Wright discussing the inspiration for each. Rounding out the extras are the original season one and season two promo reels. It should also be noted that the packaging states that ""Satisfaction Guaranteed"" and ""Witches Feast"" aren't included but""Satisfaction Guaranteed"" was found in time to be included in this set (the packaging couldn't be revised in time to get this out). ""Witches Feast"" will be included in a third season set should this sell well because it was too late to be included here.

The six commentary tracks with three by Skelton and Benson discussing episodes 4 (""A Fear of Spiders"", ""Junior"", Marmalade Wine"", ""The Academy""), 12 (""Cool Air""- where the duo point out a modern Universal services truck very clearly visible in the back window of a car in the episode ""Cool Air"" which is set in 1923-""Camera Obscura"", ""Quoth the Raven""), 16 (""Lindemann's Catch"", ""The Late Mr. Peddington"", ""A Feast of Blood"")and director Del Toro on episodes 5 (""The Phantom Farmhouse"", ""Silent Snow, Secret Snow"")13 (""The Messiah of Mott Street"", ""The Painted Mirror"")and Del Toro's favorite episode--and mine--22 with ""The Caterpillar"" (and ""Little Girl Lost"" as the ""B"" episode as Del Toro refers to it).

Fans will want to snatch this up immediately and all I can say is that I am looking forward to season three in hope that Universal will spent as much time and effort on the extras as they did here on this excellent set. I hope to see ""Witches Feast"" as a bonus episode on the third season set and--for those fans who grew up watching this in syndication--perhaps Universal COULD include one or two episodes of ""The Sixth Sense"" (the two best episodes perhaps)along with Serling's introductions as part of that set. Highly recommended.",1224979200,7,4271,5.0014064697609
3543490,5,B001DXS4DI,"Finally, after 4 years since the release of Season 1, Night Gallery's second season will see the light of day on DVD.  As this is the best season for NG, it's been a long road.

3543492,5,B001DXS4DI,"Season Two of ""Night Gallery"" had some of its best episodes. I have seen these episodes in syndication a great deal - they have held up very well over time. However, even if I hadn't seen them in 37 years there are some episodes that I would still remember. In particular there is the excellent ""The Caterpillar"" with Lawrence Harvey as a man who covets another man's wife and decides to do away with the husband in a way untraceable by the authorities. An earwick - a small caterpillar native to the tropical area - left on the pillow of the man that will burrow through his brain. The question is - do you trust a total stranger to put the earwick on the right pillow? ""A Question of Fear"" has a pre-Airplane Leslie Nielsen playing a mercenary who accepts a bet to stay in a haunted house overnight. However, his host has a past grievance. ""Tell David"" has a young woman, unhappy with her life and feeling that her husband is being unfaithful, meeting her son decades in the future when she takes a long drive. She is both reassured and resigned to her own fate by what she learns. In ""He ll's Bells"" John Astin plays someone who recently died. He recalls paintings of Hades while waiting for his final judgement, and thinks that the afterlife down under will be quite exciting. The episode suggests that perhaps He ll is in the eye of the beholder. The following are the details on the extra features:

3543493,5,B001DXS4DI,"This season, is, IMO, the best of Night Gallery.
Virtually all of my favorite episodes reside in this collection, beginning with
The Academy,that is absolutely chilling and you find yourself shifting around in your chair wanting to be far away from it...the recalitrant son of the businessman who is having the guided tour, in hopes of improving his son's outlook, is in for a very different education.
I enjoyed The Diary primarily to watch the excellent performance by Patty Duke, reminiscent of her Neely O'Hara role in Valley of the Dolls. She does a great interpretation of a female you would never want to meet.
Camera Obscura is my number on all time favorite episode ever; Ross Martin and Rene Auberjenois are fabulous in their respective roles and the story is wonderful, Ross Martin is a collector par excellence and when he tries and fails to reform Auberjonois's greed in his zeal to collect his debts (by use of practices which can only be described as usury) from an impoverished friend of Martin's, Martin shows Auberjonois one last item in his collection: A camera obscura.
And last but not least of my favorites, The Caterpillar, starring Laurence Harvey and Joanna Pettit, when Harvey is so bedazzled by her beauty he schemes to get possession of her by any means available.
These shows represent the best of the best, and each one is a brilliant stand alone study of human (and sometimes inhuman) nature in all its forms. When I saw these episodes when they first came out, I was absolutely enthralled; I never missed a show and watched them every time they were on like it was the first time; never dreaming that someday they would all be available to watch as often as I wished in my own home. What a treat!!!

3543494,5,B001DXS4DI,"For most fans of ""Rod Serling's Night Gallery,"" season two is when the show really hit its stride with its kaleidoscopic mix of thoughtful Serling originals (""Class of '99,"" ""Dr. Stringfellow's Rejuvenator,"" ""The Messiah on Mott Street,"" ""Lindemann's Catch,"" ""Deliveries in the Rear"") and vivid adaptations of classic horror fiction by Serling and others (""The Boy Who Predicted Earthquakes,"" ""A Fear of Spiders,"" ""Silent Snow, Secret Snow,"" ""A Question of Fear,"" ""Pickman's Model,"" ""Cool Air,"" ""Camera Obscura,"" ""Green Fingers,"" ""I'll Never Leave You--Ever,"" ""The Sins of the Fathers,"" ""The Caterpillar,"" and many more). Most of the series' best-remembered story segments are here in their original, uncut broadcast form; so are the critically reviled comic blackouts, which left a bad taste in the mouths of some and caused others to reject the series altogether. (On the plus side, they're fairly brief and generally restricted to the first half of the season. Those so inclined may, through the magic of DVD technology, skip over the offending vignettes.)

Universal has included some generous bonus features, including a 30-minute documentary, a menu of Tom Wright's superb paintings for the show (with commentary by the artist), and six episode commentaries: three by filmmaker Guillermo del Toro (""Hellboy II: The Golden Army,"" ""Pan's Labyrinth""), throwing light on the series' influence, and three by Scott Skelton (me) and Jim Benson (co-authors of the series companion ""Rod Serling's Night Gallery: An After-Hours Tour""), offering cultural and historical context and a general appreciation of the show.

Rod Serling is well-known today for his role in that series but not as much for his subsequent effort years later, ""Night Gallery,"" since the latter show was not as long-run or successful as the former.  Still, ""Night Gallery"" had its share of great moments, many of which are included in this DVD set that contains all 22 episodes of the show's second season that were originally broadcast on NBC from September 1971 to March 1972.

""Night Gallery"" leans much more to horror and the macabre than did ""The Twilight Zone,"" with a bit of humor thrown into the mix as well.  Many of the stories start with people, some from the then-present time but others in other eras, in ordinary situations before the supernatural intervenes.  The cast of actors changes with each episode, with George Maharis, Michael Constantine, Vincent Price, Arte Johnson, Zsa Zsa Gabor, Harry Morgan, Bill Bixby, Donna Douglas, Cloris Leachman, and Buddy Ebsen being some of the most familiar and noteworthy.

""Night Gallery"" is a pretty good horror series but a notch below ""The Twilight Zone.""  The format of the episodes varies, with two stories being told per episode much of the time, three stories of varying length in others, and two long and two short stories in others.

I understand that Rod Serling had great difficulty with the producers and sponsors when he tried to run this show and quit after a few seasons And, it is reflected in some of the poorer episodes.

3543570,3,B001DXS4DI,"I rented only the 2nd season because I read reviews on-line that said that this was the best season. Of all of episodes, I recalled only a few from my viewing of them back when the episodes originally aired. This could be because I didn't follow the series at the time because it wasn't that impressive or because the episodes just weren't that memorable. Having watched them again with these rentals, I believe either could be the case.

While the acting was typically excellent, understandable considering the actors involved, and the dialog typically intelligent, also understandable since these were mostly adapted from short stories, many of the episodes seemed far too long and drawn out and the ""surprise twist"" endings far too easy to see well in advance of the ending. I don't know if this is simply a characteristic of short stores adapted to screenplays, poor adaptations, or poor short stories.

Unlike some of the classic 30 minute Twilight Zone episodes where the ""surprise twist"" ending was clever and well concealed, there was only one episode in this Night Gallery second season series of episodes that surprised me. It was one with a humorous tone and ended with a husband (clearly a dummy) plunging from a ritzy high rise apartment building. The other episode that I recalled from its original broadcast had a surprise ending for me during in it's original broadcast. It ended wiith the line ""it laid eggs.""",1425513600,,1426,4.912863070539419

Season Two was/is wonderful.  I've not seen these since the 70's - no, I have not used the web to find uploaded episodes.  They look and sound great.

3543602,5,B001DXS4DI,"The second season of Rod Serling's Night Gallery is loaded with chilling treasures and some sly humor.  This was the program's best season of the three it was on the air.  Two of NG's most memorable episodes are here; ""The Boy Who Predicted Earthquakes"" with Clint Howard, and ""The Caterpillar"" (aka The Earwig.)  Some of Hollywood's major players of the 1960s and 70s are here: Vincent Price, Carl Reiner, Zsa Zsa Gabor, Leslie Nielsen, Ceasar Romero, William Windom, and even the incomparable Edward G. Robinson.  In addition to the eerie tales of terror, revenge, and just desserts for evil doers, there are the short, humorous vignettes that balance the program.  Look for Werner Klemperer (Colonel Klink from Hogan's Heroes) as a vampire who never had a proper funeral, who purchases one from Joe Flynn (Capt. Binghampton from McHale's Navy) and the very funny results of the purchase.  Actor John Astin plays a hippie who winds up in hell after a car wreck, but finds out it isn't at all what he expected, but is horrible none the less.  There are a few clinkers, of course.  ""Silent Snow, Secret Snow"", ""Brenda"" and ""The Tune In Dan's Cafe"" don't measure up, but all in all, season two of Night Gallery can be counted upon to send shivers up your spine, like the opening of a creaky coffin lid.",1407369600,,1301,4.725663716814159

3543605,3,B001DXS4DI,"As the creative genius behind the best TV anthology series of all time, ""The Twilight Zone,"" Rod Serling is unquestionably one of the medium's all time giants. Serling was not content to rest on his laurels after ""Zone"" finally ended and came up with an idea for a new series for the 1970s, ""Night Gallery."" However, this time around, he lacked overall creative control over the show and, instead of episode after episode of brilliant television, the results were decidedly mixed.

""Gallery"" was a 60-minute show that featured anywhere from two to four stories of varying length per episode. Serling hosted the show, whose concept was an art gallery filled with grotesque paintings, each of which suggested a particular story. He also contributed 30 scripts over the show's three-year run (Serling wrote 92 ""Twilight Zone"" episodes). However, by the time this 22-episode second season aired, Serling had pretty much lost creative control of the series to the show's more pedestrian producer, Jack Laird. Instead of Serling's science fiction and fantasy morality plays, Laird preferred horror and revenge, and Laird's idea of fantasy was more ghoulish monsters than a vaguely sinister Lucifer.

The quality and tone of ""Night Gallery"" episodes varied wildly, even between stories in the same episode. The problems weren't in front of the camera. Probably due to the Serling name, the show featured numerous motion picture actors like Robert Morse, Geraldine Page, Vincent Price, and Orson Welles, along with well-known TV actors of the day like Buddy Ebsen, Ross Martin, David McCallum, and Leslie Nielsen. Unfortunately, all too often the shows also featured cheesy monsters, excessively padded scripts (even with the freedom that the show's multiple stories per episode allowed, a number of stories dragged on too long), and lame attempts at humor. The worst stories were some one- or two-minute blackout sketches intended as short jokes and inserted as filler, such as Dracula trying to make a withdrawal at a blood bank (fortunately, as the season went on, Laird phased out the blackout sketches). The show did bring a couple of classic H.P. Lovecraft horror stories to the screen but pretty much ruined their impact with some low-budget special effects similar to those in the series ""Kolchak the Night Stalker.""

Despite the show's flaws and a number of dud stories, this second season is still worth a marginal recommendation. About a half dozen of the stories are really good and another dozen or so were decent, so that pretty much every episode had something to recommend it. Many of the better stories were based on a revenge theme, in which a nasty sort got his or her comeuppance, often in a supernatural manner.

Although the season featured a number of good stories, it only had two truly memorable ones (unlike the ""Twilight Zone,"" which easily had a few dozen episodes that stand out even today), both written by Serling and both featuring excellent turns by actors who rarely appeared on television. In ""The Messiah on Mott Street,"" Edward G. Robinson was a dying Jewish man trying to care for his grandson, and hoping for a miracle during the Hanukkah season. Striking a completely different tone, ""The Caterpillar"" featured Laurence Harvey as a man who tried to kill his employer in order to get closer to the man's wife, but his plan backfired in a most horrific manner. I saw both episodes during the shows initial run, and they still hold up well forty years later.

The DVD box set features some impressive bonus features. Noted Mexican horror director Guillermo del Toro provides audio commentary on three episodes (including the ones featuring ""Mott Street"" and ""Caterpillar"") and a pair of avid ""Night Gallery"" historians contribute commentaries on three other episodes. In addition, there is a fairly insightful 30-minute ""making of"" documentary with reminiscences from some of the actors and directors (including John Badham) who worked on the show and an entertaining featurette in which the artist who painted the paintings used on the show describes his thoughts in creating some of them.

Having seen many of the episodes of the show when they originally aired, I was struck by the way so many of its episodes disappointed me when I watched them again on DVD. The show simply hasn't aged well, with a lot of stories that range from disappointing to dreadful, There's enough quality here, especially in the uniformly solid acting performances, for me to give it a mild recommendation (""Mott Street"" and ""Caterpillar"" are almost enough for me to recommend the show in and of themselves), and the bonus features are a welcome addition. However, for those who want to remember Serling at his best, check out ""The Twilight Zone"" instead.",1401321600,2,4764,5.062420382165605

3543613,5,B001DXS4DI,"""Night Gallery"" Season 2 has been given a supreme treatment on DVD. Some of the episodes require your patience, but this is not a bad thing, even in the crazy, everything's-a-brief-commercial world of entertainment that we have nowadays. This great series represents the best era of real television programming, and this season 2 set is probably the best of the ""Gallery"" on display. I will offer some brief thoughts of my own. First, I think this is a far better show than the preachy, over-written ""Twilight Zone"" series, as each one of those pounded home the moral with a sledge hammer and always featured a hokey twist-ending and childish characters. Not so in ""Night Gallery."" With Laird at the controls, the series became more like a mini-film festival every week, featuring the very best of fantastic storytelling and teleplay writing. The marriage between Serling and Laird is not the ""embarrassment"" that some critics think it is. ""Night Gallery"" was a more mature show, slowly paced at times, always scary, always on target--it may feel a bit dated at spots, but mostly it's a timeless foray into the bizarre. ""The Boy who Predicted Earthquakes"" is chilling. No one would film and release an episode like that for TV today. ""The Class of '99"" is Serling's best script for the show, and it is punctuated by Vincent Price's thoroughly restrained performance. ""Since Aunt Ada Came to Stay"" is probably the scariest witch story ever done for television; the cast and the direction are on target. ""Silent Snow, Secret Snow"" and ""Brenda"" are forerunners of great problem-child movies (such as ""The Exorcist"", for example) from the 70s, in which parents begin to lose their grip upon their children, and a ""lost"" generation emerges from the conservative womb of older times and enters a new land of sluggishness, hippiedom, alternate religious beliefs, paranoia, disillusionment, detachment, and deformity. These two episodes are probably the most sensitively written of the lot; I think that ""Night Gallery"" was the first television show to take seriously the idea of child autism (here, it seems, specifically dealing with variations on Asperger's syndrome), and what it feels like to be an outsider in a world that always wants to be ""in."" These are two of my favorites. ""The Devil is Not Mocked"" represents a great adaptation of the Manly Wade Wellman short story of the same title (what a boon it would have been to be a story editor for this show, obdurate decisions being inevitable on occasion, yet I think Laird helped pick some of the best 'weird' literature authors to adapt). ""House with Ghost"" is a pretty good adaptation of August Derleth, featuring a rare horror-themed performance by the irrepressible Bob Crane. ""Pickman's Model"" is a great adaptation of Lovecraft, sensitively acted, well-constructed too. ""Cool Air"" is also good. ""There Aren't Any More MacBanes"" is a terrific thriller, that one will keep you on the edge, with some pretty good special effects at the end (for their time). ""A Feast of Blood"" is a fun one starring Sandra Locke, if admittedly a misogynistic piece. ""Last Rites for a Dead Druid"" is a memorable episode featuring a very bizarre incident involving a statue and some very black magic. I don't agree with reviewers who feel that the ""black-out"" comedy segments written by Laird hurt the show's momentum; if anything, it helps to lighten the mood on occasion, working in comfortable satire, providing a sharp contrast to Serling's impatient plea to deal with social commentary stories. In time, this show is going to come under a serious reassessment, and it will be seen for the innovative, frightening, unique, and powerfully presented masterwork that it is. Much better than ""The Twilight Zone"" in my opinion.
The DVD set is fantastic. The bonus documentary about the making of the show is a keeper, featuring John Boorman's thoughts, as well as words from the composer, the set designer, and (I believe) the man who created the paintings themselves. Audio commentaries, too, are informative--Del Toro seems to regret that the DVD's producers couldn't provide more space for more commentary, but, despite his well-understood lamenting, this is a great presentation of this program on DVD. Very much worth the price alone. The picture and sound are very nice indeed, and cleaned up a bit too. Overall, if you are a fan of classic TV shows or just want to see something that is more unique than your average fantasy show, watch this one. Human actors, great sets, limited corny effects, stories that are slowly paced so you can follow them and not feel dizzy while watching, and tremendous music and stories. To me, it's a keeper!

Not many, but some.  It stayed on for three seasons and there were many outstanding actors who appeared, some of whom were on the much-greater ""Twilight Zone"" 10+ years earlier.  Most shows have a bellcurve - about 20 percent of episodes in the series are excellent, about two-thirds are 'good but not great' and another 10 percent are below average.  I'd say ""Night Gallery"" pretty well followed the same pattern.  Had it been produced better, and if the network had let Rod and company do what they needed to, it would've been much better.

3543631,4,B001DXS4DI,"I wanted to ask the Night Gallery fans out there about Season Two: Episode Eleven: ""The Flip Side of Satan."" I originally saw this episode (twice) on the SciFi channel during the late nineties. The version on the DVD I just purchased is quite different. When I viewed it on the SciFi channel, the episode contained scenes of what appeared to be an abandoned small town with the wind blowing leaves, etc., about.  There were also close-ups of grotesque faces (demons?) that can still be seen on the opening montage, and hokey, soft focused shots of a woman calling out in distress (and even tumbling down?) to the main character, in what was perhaps memory flashbacks.

All of this is gone on the DVD.  Instead, there are somewhat long conversations on the phone between the DJ and two unseen ""friends"" that explain why he has been sent to this isolated town on this strange assignment. I vaguely remember some of the conversation but not them going on as long or going into as much detail; it's almost as if the DJ is reciting the plot; it doesn't feel very convincing that these are spontaneous conversations.  The whole episode falls flat as it is just the DJ, ""Jay-Jay"" (sp?)talking on the phone and freaking out; you only see the outside world when he initially pulls up in the car. There are no disturbing visuals to go with the creepy music & eerie, satanic verse on the record albums.

The reason I am mentioning this is that I was disappointed with this version; while the other one was somewhat corny, I was fond of it; it had atmosphere and a sense of mystery, which this version seems to be lacking. Does anyone know if there were two versions to begin with, and which one was the original, or was the original just edited and I'm not fully remembering the phone dialogue?  Thanks!

As has been mentioned, there are quite a few gems in this collection, whereas some episodes were just silly, and others are not aging as well. Rod Serling is perfect as the narrator/guide and I really appreciate the whole concept behind the gallery of dark paintings, and as he puts it: ""statuary.""  This is an historically important series and I wish it could be redone/restored to the full vision and intent Serling had for it.",1364947200,2,2223,4.610126582278481

Poe, here was TV aimed right at me AND I COULDN'T SEE IT REGULARLY (sadly, this was before VCRS), and when it went into syndication the episodes were edited considerably, AND the cable stations in my part of the world showed it so late (12:30am, which meant, invariably, I fell asleep) so, an appeal to the fan, here is NIGHT GALLERY in all its restored, & remastered glory available to watch on a fresh brain, or whenever your circadian rhythm allows!

OH, the mood setting music this morning... right now it's the fabulous soundtrack to that stellar Duncan Jones film, MOON, yet I will be replacing it with TWILIGHT ZONE in a moment... unfortunate that NIGHT GALLERY never made it to vinyl or CD (or did it???? If it did, it eludes my grasp)... rest assured, this will not be a comparison contrast of TWILIGHT ZONE with the NIGHT GALLERY (I shall put forth that ""The Zone"" is nothing but stellar, and I still love that show, but I shall let ""The Gallery"" be its own enitity for the sake of this review)... let's begin...

What makes great horror? I've never wanted to be a surgeon, so when horror films started to try to ""scare"" me with graphic violence, I sat there in the theater and asked, ""This is scary?... no, it's simply grotesque."" Darren McGavin (yeah, CARL KOLCHAK [& ""the old man"" from A CHRISTMAS STORY] Ooooh, great tie in: Gil Melle composed the theme to THE NIGHT STALKER, and NIGHT GALLERY) once said that ""scary"" is as follows: you're alone late at night and you hear ""something"" strange... you go to the source to investigate and there's nothing there... you return to what you were doing and... you hear it again... in other words ""atmosphere"", and NIGHT GALLERY contains countless frightening ""atmospheric"" qualities... atmosphere juxtaposed with great writing (especially when Mr. Serling was more involved with the show), as well as the endless list of GREAT GUEST STARS made this unforgettable show unique...

Other reviews espouse the second season as the one where ""The Gallery"" really hit its stride... the review is correct (although SEASONS 1 & 3 should not be overlooked)... among the standouts in SEASON 2 inlcude:

LAST RITES FOR A DEAD DRUID (tell me the statue of BIXBY's ancestor ""moving"" didn't terrify you)...

FLIP SIDE OF SATAN (eerie!!!!!!)

SINS OF THE FATHERS (often billed as ""not for the sqeamish"")

PICKMAN'S MODEL (I never saw this one in the past so it packed a wallop upon first viewing)

GREEN FINGERS (The Bride of Frankenstein has nothing on Elsa's character here... the image of her in the rocking chair at the end still ""sends shivers"")

COOL AIR (great ""crescendo""... I'll let you be surprised)

MESSIAH OF MOTT STREET (try never to outgrow sentimentality... a nice companion piece to this is THE TWILIGHT ZONE'S, NIGHT OF THE MEEK)

CAMERA OBSCURA (Ross Martin is fabulous in this eldritch tale)...

I could go on, and there are other great episodes in addition to these standouts (THE WAITING ROOM, THE CATERPILLAR, THE BOY WHO PREDICTED EARTHQUAKES, SINCE AUNT ADA CAME TO STAY)... watching these years after its run, as well as THE TWILIGHT ZONE, reinforces how gifted Rod Serling was, and how, as one critic stated, he gave television some of its most memorable, inspired, and creative moments...

Also, his wave of massive hair during the spoken intro is a wonder in its own right. God Bless Rod.

Post-script: I've watched much of this and it is pretty uneven. It's not up to Twilight Zone standards but the intro and the paintings alone make up for any flaws. It was cool to learn that the title sequence was worked out in a week by the graphic designer- he scanned the creepy paintings and made that hypnotic sequence with possibly the creepies theme music on TV ever.

3543657,4,B001DXS4DI,"The Twilight Zone to Night Gallery;
Apples to Oranges?
Okey, more like lemons.
But we like lemons too.
However, I find these too nostalgic not to give them a good rating.

Only four stars because part of that memory is left out;
left out time filler inserts found necessary on TV,
really just mostly wordless, special effect scenes,
even though they only tend to give a tacky, superfluous feeling,
and even while not being truly cut because I see new scenes that actually were cut
on shortened TV versions.

I mean, ""On The Flipside Of Satan"" JJ is suddenly at the radio station,
at the beginning, instead of his guilt ridden ride through the wooded hills,
with the ghostly images of sad faced girls haunting him.
(and that sound effect instrument?,they use so much, in the background.)
In ""House With Ghost"", looking for a different and haunted house in the countryside,
there is no short scene of their drive on one of those quaint little English roads;
no, they are just suddenly driving up to the front of the house.
It seems to be a driving thing, so far.
Perhaps this doesn't happen when scenes like this are too much a part of the story;
The ride, with weird faces, is still in ""Hell's Bells"".

Night Gallery is more of a visual story medium; more outdoor scenes;
so the visual should be intact as much as possible.
(Except for that ""Marmalade Wine"" thing; It's more like a play.
Showing how we may learn from TV; Be careful who you drink with!)
Still, this is a season with fairly good writing.
""Silent Snow, Secret Snow"" is all there (even if a depressing story)
and the picture and sound are so clear on these DVD's.",1319673600,,1626,4.5426621160409555
3543658,2,B001DXS4DI,There are only about five good episodes in this entire season. sadly it's nowhere as good as the twilight zone despite serling's efforts. don't trust the hype on this one.,1319155200,2,171,4.733333333333333
3543659,4,B001DXS4DI,"Although he wrote and directed numerous programs, Rod Serling (1924-1975) is best recalled as the creator of the television series THE TWILIGHT ZONE, which debuted on CBS in 1959--and which, in spite of continued critical and audience popularity, fell prey to network politics and budgeting issues and was canceled in 1964. Serling continued to work, but it was not until 1969 that he contemplated a series once more: NIGHT GALLERY.

NIGHT GALLERY began as a ""feature-length"" NBC television special in which Serling, in a dimly-lit museum, introduced three gothic and irony laced stories that incorporated paintings in the story line. The three stories were ""The Cemetery,"" starring Roddy McDowall and Ossie Davis; ""Eyes,"" starring Joan Crawford in one of her last roles and directed by newcomer Stephen Spielberg; and ""Escape Route"" starring Richard Kiley and Sam Jaffe. All three stories were written by Serling and are available in the season one DVD edition of the series.

The original program was very well received, and in 1970 the concept of an anthology of such stories became part of a ""wheel series""--several continuing series that rotated through the same time slot over a period of several weeks. In this instance, the other rotating series were MCCLOUD, SFX, and THE PSYCHIATRIST. The latter two were canceled after the first season and MCCLOUD went on to become part of another wheel series, the NBC Mystery Movie; NIGHT GALLERY continued as a stand-alone series through 1973. During its later run it went from an hour to a half hour, and during later syndication its various episodes were edited and reshuffled to a point at which is actually a little difficult to know when each episode was filmed, when it first aired, and whether or not it was later edited to a point at which it could not be fully restored.

According to various records, the 1971 season included sixty two stories in twenty-two episodes.  Most of these stories ran from ten to twenty minutes, but as the season progressed the episodes began to include a number of ""black out"" sketches--extremely short comedy bits that rounded out the episode in the moments before commercial breaks.  Although Rod Serling was not without dry humor, and while he often made use of irony, he despised these sketches and sought to eliminate them from the series ... only to discover that his contract did not give him full creative control.  That control was actual invested in Jack Laird, a television producer, writer, and occasional actor who slowly but surely wrested away any joy Serling took in the series.  Television critics and historians generally consider the second season the best, but by the time it ended Serling--although he continued to appear as narrator and supply scripts as specified by his contract--absolutely loathed the series and everything about it.

Regardless of the season, NIGHT GALLERY was always an uneven sort of show.  Rod Serling wrote many of the scripts, but lesser writers contributed the bulk, and each segment was directed by a different person, so the result was very hit or miss.  It was also a very expensive show to do because, as an anthology, it had no repeating sets or props or costumes: everything had to be made from scratch for each episode.  Because of this, NIGHT GALLERY was fairly expensive, and producer Laird constantly pushed the directors to shoot as fast possible, hoping to save a buck.  This had an odd effect: actors could come in an do an episode in one or two days and go home with a nice paycheck.  Actors who seldom or never appeared on television, such as Geraldine Page, E.G. Marshall, Kim Stanley, and Edward G. Robinson appeared, and the series was also able to catch a lot of rising talent including Desi Arnez Jr., Patty Duke, Sally Field, and Joel Grey.  Uneven though it might be, NIGHT GALLERY was never without star power.

In truth, about half of the episodes are throw-aways, watchable, often entertaining, but not particularly memorable.  Perhaps another quarter were just downright bad.  But that remaining quarter--when NIGHT GALLERY worked, it was a knockout.  ""A Fear of Spiders,"" ""The Academy,"" ""Silent Snow, Secret Snow"" (narrated by Orson Wells, no less), ""Cool Air,"" ""The Messiah on Mott Street,"" ""Green Fingers,"" and ""Sins of the Fathers"" are justly acclaimed, and the moody ""The Dark Boy"" is significantly underrated.  One famous episode has not fared well: ""Pickman's Model,"" loosely based on the Lovecraft story, shocked and horrified audiences in 1970, but seen today the costumes involved are little short of hilarious.  On the other hand, there is what is probably the single most celebrated episode in the entire series: ""The Caterpillar,"" a beautifully filmed and genuinely unnerving story of an invasive insect with an unfortunately maternal instinct.

It would be difficult to describe NIGHT GALLERY as a horror series.  A few of its episode did indeed pack a horror punch--""A Fear of Spiders"" is a good example--but the series was really more in the ""weird tales"" tradition, and it was at its best when it offered moody pieces such as ""Brenda"" and ""Big Surprise.""  The script for ""Sins of the Father"" was so impressive that it actually lured Barbara Steele out of retirement, and while Laird's scripts tend to be silly-funny, such episodes as ""Green Fingers"" are funny in a creep-you-out way.  Ultimately Serling would tire of fighting Laird and, like THE TWILIGHT ZONE, the network would find the series more trouble than it was worth.  But if you are a Serling fan, or you remember the series fondly, it is more than worth a look.

The second season DVD set includes five disks, and each disk includes at least one bonus in the form of an audio commentary.  The fifth disk, however, offers considerably more, with several featurettes that offer interviews from NIGHT GALLERY actors, musicians, directors and such.  It's all good fun.  Recommended.

They are notorious for ending the release of a series after a season or two. Some real geniuses working there. I'm now stuck with partial runs of Alfred Hitchcock Presents, Night Gallery, Cannon, etc... If you like to collect full runs of classic TV shows like I do, it's almost better not to buy the first seasons from Universal/Paramount in the first place.

So, they are seemingly putting out a season every four years?, there is a season three, I suppose it will come out in 2012.

3543665,5,B001DXS4DI,"I was delighted to finally get a copy of Night Gallery. Excellent set. Worth adding to your collections.

This set includes the episode ""Brenda"" which I had partially remembered from the original airing where a shaggy monster was caught in a pit... but that's all I had remembered until having this opportunity to watch it again. I was never able to find it on a rerun so this was the first time I have been able to see it since the original airing.

I had been hoping for some extras on the DVD's but there were none. I always felt like the ""Brenda"" episode had ended unfinished and appeared to have chunks chopped out of it... whether it was chopped from the original story or script or production or edited thereafter... I'm not certain... but it does look chopped from the way it ended hanging. I was sorry to see that there was no extra info on the DVD set about this episode, but from what I did hear, I guess we are lucky to have these episodes at all. Apparently, they were brought to DVD with great difficulty.

As for the episode ""Brenda"" I don't agree with the commenters on the internet about her character being some lonely, innocent child seeking a companion. I found her character to be just the opposite.

It came across to me as an episode about the type of brat who captures and torments animals, insects or other kids. This is a taunter and tormenter on a power trip at any age... perhaps a future candidate for Munchausen's by proxy or a juvenile Ted Bundy on the rise. Letting the creature into the house was just a way to torment the parents and taunt the creature like an animal caught in a trap... then let it go again, only to turn around and taunt it some more.

I understood what they were trying to do with the storyline although it did not work out very well from what I could see. The episode seemed like it ended in midstream and was never finished. It left the ending just hanging. I would like to see the original written storyline. This episode definitely looks edited... like it was hacked apart before it was originally aired... so I don't think it was a DVD transfer issue. I think the DVD version is like the original broadcast... but it has been so long since I saw the original, I can't remember for certain.

I saw a post from someone who said this story for ""Brenda"" came from something called ""Weird Tales"" published in 1954. If so, I'd like to find that and read it. That sounds like a comic book? I'm not sure. Perhaps it had a better ending?

I'd be interested in any improved info on that episode. I think it might have been interesting to follow it through to the conclusion where the creature would likely end up eating her at the most poignant, trusting moment.",1290816000,5,2711,4.41

The show was a nice anthology of horror, fantasy, and sci-fi, and I was pleased to learn that Jeannot Szwarc, one of my favorite Smallville directors, helmed a number of episode at the suggestion of Rod Serling himself.

Now that I have viewed the shows on DVD, and in full color, it brings them back to life once more. Seeing Mr. Wright's paintings in color gives them more meaning, not just the contrasts of Grey, black, and whites. Even though the corny little shorts were included in the set, I still remember THAT part of watching the show back then (especially Big Surprise, scared the heck out of me, just the look on the blond kids face backing out of the hole they dug).

I had thought that this DVD set was already out, and was waiting for the right time to purchase it, only to find out it wasn't...until NOW! I will be sitting at home for a few nights after it arrives. Nothing will tear me away from the moments I remembered as a pre-teen kid watching for the first time. Certain images have followed me throughout my life, and there are plenty to remember in this series. When I got the first set, I was expecting to see some of those images once again, but was disappointed to find out that the most memorable ones were in the second season. Throughout the series, scenes like the old man coming out of the hole in the ground, The guy in the haunted house following a trail of liquid in the dirt basement floor only to be confronted with a specter appearing from the darkness of a dark room (just got goose bumps typing that), the art instructor yelling at his student and painting over what she had painted only to reveal his vision of what the model looks like...a ghoulish monster, and the epitome for me at the time was the images of a dead man rising from his grave, walking up to a house, up to the door, and then the darned door creaking open, and seeing it played out in ever changing paintings was too much for my little heart. Ahh the memories!

Strange what we will wait for for over three decades to see once more. Wasn't once enough? If there was any collection of great old shows I would recommend, it would be these. Night Gallery kept me up at least once a week for the years it was on. Now it's time to lose more sleep.",1255737600,5,2590,4.316221765913758
3543676,5,B001DXS4DI,Do not buy this DVD if you expect HI-DEF picture quality. Some of the older episodes are poor quality on big screen Hi Def. But the rest of the other reviews say about the same thing. I like the show so I bought it.,1254960000,3,215,3.909090909090909
3543677,5,B001DXS4DI,"Night Gallery was the scariest fun around when I was a kid.  Staying up late to watch stories like ""Lindemann's Catch"" and ""Pickman's Model"" is one of my fondest memories.  In season 2, the show really came into its own and produced some of the best segments, in my opinion.  The whole concept of an anthology series where the stories are represented by paintings is brilliant, and Tom Wright's artwork is sometimes more memorable than the segment it introduces.
It helps to have an understanding of the early-mid Seventies to really appreciate Night Gallery.  The ""Monster Craze"" was still a pop-culture force among young people.  Aurora model kits of Frankenstein, Dracula, The Phantom of the Opera, etc., were still selling on store shelves across America.  Cartoon ghouls were all over Saturday morning cartoon blocs.  Jack Laird, the producer, sometimes injected this monster-mania wackiness into Night Gallery, which gives the show its own particular style and feeling.  It also brought him into conflict with the brilliant Rod Serling, who loathed the sillier short segments, and wanted Night Gallery to be a more cerebral showcase for television drama, evoking his earlier career highlights with Playhouse 90 and Twilight Zone.
Though Serling didn't have the kind of creative control over Night Gallery that he wanted or should have had, he contributed a great deal of the show's best scripts, and it is still ""his"" show even more so than Laird's in some respects, and not just because Serling's name and face are out in front (The show's real title is ""Rod Serling's Night Gallery"").  Actually, the mix of styles is quite in keeping with the whole ""gallery"" concept, making the show appeal to a range of tastes.  I am very grateful Universal decided to release season two, and give it respect, with fascinating extras and attractive packaging. Worth owning for anyone inclined to appreciate the genre, the era, or the genius and irreplaceable screen presence of Rod Serling.",1252800000,2,1983,5.073846153846154

My video is designed to give you a feel for the mood and tone of the series and show an example of how the drama segments are introduced, also the layout and artwork of the media and box set. Night Gallery cuts across the genres of horror, science fiction and dark humor. It doesn't fit perfectly into one of these, or any of these categories.  For me the most enjoyment I got from the series is seeing Rod Serling's brief stoic narrative introductions to each episode segment himself via the vaguely unnerving paintings in the backdrop of the shadowy Night Gallery. Rod, impeccably dressed and coiffed in his signature black jacket and tie has a resonant voice that makes you pay attention as if something vitally important is being said. The introductions where Serling sometimes imparts a bit of cautionary wisdom to the ""visitors"" of the night gallery can occasionally offer a more chilling feeling than the actual production itself.  There is no doubt you will find the effects and the sets of the individual dramas dated. But that is part of the retro charm of the series as viewed from a modern perspective. With the likes of SAW, Silent Hill, Star Wars, and TV series like the new Outer Limits, the Friday The 13th series ( anyone remember the V series? ), etc..., having made their impressions, the episodes of Night Gallery are not going to seem very impressive by comparison. However, there are many epsiodes that maintain their nail-biting tension and edge-of-your-seat drama because of the great writing, directing, and serious acting..., three elements which can rise above older values in cinematography and set production. Which is why great older series such as Alfred Hitchcock Presents still have powerful entertainment impact today.  Season two of Night Gallery starts off with two such high impact episodes.  ""The Boy Who Could Predict EarthQuakes"" and ""The Hand Of Borgus Weems"". Both episodes are unnerving. In the first we are treated to the exploitation of a young boy's gift for clairvoyence. Until, one day, he predicts something terrible that no one wants to hear. In the second, a man's life is taken over by a force beyond his control as his hand suddenly carries within it a supernatural determination to follow a deadly course of action.  Other episodes that I would recommend in the second season are ""Since Aunt Ada Came To Stay"", a brilliantly concieved supernatural drama in which a very rational, very logical college professor suddenly finds himself believing in witchcraft and that his wife's life is in deadly danger from it.  This episode is particularly interesting for it's co-star Jonathan Harris ( Doctor Smith from Lost In Space ), who plays a friend of the professor who gives him advice on how to defeat the supernatural power he is facing. ""Pickman's Model"" a fairly good limited production of the classic H.P. Lovecraft tale of an artist who has delved far too deep into the supernatural vistas of his world to find models for his strange unnerving paintings. There are others worth viewing as well. ""The Messiah On Mott Street"", written by Rod Serling himself , I believe this marks one of the last television appearances of the great Edward G. Robinson, as an aged and dying grandfather trapped in a little run down apartment on Mott Street trying to care for his young grandson. It's a heartwarming story, not typical of the series, but very satisfying. While you should not expect to be ""wowed"" by the sets or the effects, overall I must recommend this series for anyone who enjoys great acting and great entertainment. It is well worth the investment.  The disks themselves functioned perfectly. The video was clean and the color was magnificent, the audio also is outstanding. The DVD's performed flawlessly.

Those who dismiss this show as merely a ""poor man's Twilight Zone"" are doing it and themselves a diservice. While not ""groundbreaking"" in its story telling or format, NG is unique, quirky and entertaining. Many of these episodes I either missed at first viewing as a child or simply failed to remember.

Still, the series holds up well and I've received my fair share of chuckles and chills from the box set. I can't recomend it any higher than the 5 stars I've given it. Buy it and you'll receive hours of viewing pleasure.

3543689,2,B001DXS4DI,"Night Gallery holds a special place in alot of hearts. I am one of those people. I adored season 1 and could not wait for season 2 mainly for the Lovecraft tales which I had never seen.
With that being said there are some true gems in this collection. ""The boy who predicted earthquakes"" comes to mind and various others.
Now with the praise out of the way, on to the problem.
Sadly I found myself getting more entertainment out of the EC Archives I was reading while the dvd was playing. Most of the stories or ""paintings"" are some of the most guessable, contrived muck ever put to film. Nothing shocked, surprised, or even amused me 89% of the entire season.  Even most of the funny 5-10 minute ones fell flat in a big way.
On top of this was the picture and sound. Watchable but nothing to be awe-inspired about. Sound was decent at best.

3543694,5,B001DXS4DI,"It took four years for Universal to release the 2nd season of NIGHT GALLERY, but the wait is worth it for some of the extras included. Season 1, released in 2004,was a bare-bones affair and according to one source, it's sales lagged and a release of season 2 was in doubt. In fact, the first set included two ""bonus"" 2nd season episode which left many to doubt if a season 2 set would even be released. However, here we are with Season 2-and it is considered by many to be the very best of the show's run. All episodes are restored and not in the truncated condition that many were seen in syndication in the mid to late 70's, when the show was edited to a half hour and,the Canadian Gary Collins show, THE SIXTH SENSE was for reasons of syndication, re-tooled to fit in as ""Night Gallery"" episodes, complete with new Rod Serling intros done after the original show was cancelled(and before his untimely death). The high points of this 2nd season are adaptations of some classic horror stories, several of which are by H.P. Lovecraft and the eerie ""The Boy Who Could Predict Earthquakes"" with it's completely unforgettable twist ending. Also, there are commentaries on episodes,by, most notably Guillermo Del Toro. And for the art fan, an entire gallery of Tom Wright's classic paintings seen on the shows is an extra. The episodes seem in fine shape with a good picture, save for two which are basically re-constructed and missing segments because the whereabouts of the masters is unknown. Some is better than none, I guess in those cases.

3543697,5,B001DXS4DI,"Night Gallery fans will rejoice with the second season release of this popular anthology series.

Thanks to Universal's collaboration with ""Night Gallery: An After Hours Tour"" authors Jim Benson and Scott Skelton provide several commentaries on a number of key episodes. One wishes they were contracted for the first season's collection of DVDs were released. Their keen insight into the various installments are most welcome as they explain not just the obvious, but many of the interesting backstories to the individual episodes.

One interesting observation that the authors made was that the reason why Night Gallery attracted such outstanding acting talent was primarily based on the strength of the scripts, the short shooting schedule (a week at the most; sometimes less than 3 days--Stuart Whitman recalled learning his lines for ""Lindemann's Catch"" the night before!) and the limited theatrical-feel to the sets and the surroundings during filming. Whatever the reason, prepare yourself for eighteen hours of pleasurable television viewing, not seen in a similar format and theme until ""Roald Dahl's ""Tales of the Unexpected"" making it's debut in 1978.

Also included is an interview with director Guillermo Del Toro, whose recent work included the popular theatrical film, ""Hellboy 2."" NBC promos are also round out the set as well as a insightful short hosted by Tom Wright, the artist whose paintings introduced by Serling kicked-off each story.

The second season, usually considered the strongest of the three, clearly indicated the ever-present stamp of producer Jack Laird who, at this time, just about wrested all creative control of the series from Serling. Because of the latter's contract with NBC and Universal, Serling virtually signed away any opportunity for story approval or creative input into the anthology series. Many fans lament....""What would become of Night Gallery if Rod had been given total reign over the series as he had on Twilight Zone?""

Alas, it could also be argued that because of Laird's supervison, the second season is nothing less than an outstanding showcase of some of the finest writers and short story adaptations available--Alvin Sapinsley's superb ""Pickman's Model"" and Halsted Welles' disturbing ""Sins of the Fathers"" to name a few. Nonetheless, several of the outstanding installments of this set were written or adapted by Serling himself and they include Emmy-nominated ""The Messiah of Mott Street"" and the chilling ""The Caterpillar"" starring Lawrence Harvey and Joanna Pettet.

Those annoying vignettes are present as well and back with a vengeance with Jack Laird himself, replete with hunchback, playing Igor to Adam West's Dr. Jekyll in the ""With Apologies to Mr. Hyde."" It's nice to know our DVD players can allow us to fast forward such codswallop like the fetid ""The Witches Feast"" and get right to the main installments. In all, a delight for fans to savor.
