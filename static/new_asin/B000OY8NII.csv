2802335,3,B000OY8NII,"This show is not for rocket surgeons, or was that brain scientists?

It however, is some light entertainment to pass potato couching time. The stories aren't very original, but seem to be quite watchable and it made me  giggle quite a lot. I quite like the characters and it is easy to watch.....sooo I'd recommend it. There's much-much worse out there.
Most of my friends have been pleasantly surprised.

But it's no Stargate, Gilmore Girls or Firefly.",1181606400,5,453,4.857142857142857
2802336,5,B000OY8NII,"Eureka is a wonderful show. It is thoughtful, entertaining and on occasion very moving. It is one of the best shows available at this time. While it is not prudish it doesn't rely on the extremes of sex and violence so common on the popular network shows today. Instead, well constructed imaginative sci-fi plots, and a lot of humor make this show great for all ages. I highly recommend it.",1178755200,42,390,4.585714285714285
2802337,5,B000OY8NII,"As someone stated earlier the Sci-Fi channel over the last few years have been trying to bolster its viewership with original shows. Well ""Eureka"" is arguably the best of the bunch. The show is definately an original and is a refreshing storyline compared to the same old Science Fiction story.

First of all, the actors and actresses in this show are phenomenal. The leading character, Sheriff Jack Carter, is played by Colin Ferguson an outstanding actor. Another actor that I would like to mention by name is Joe Morton, who plays the resident genius / car garage owner by the name of Henry Deacon. Each week presents a different problem and Deacon is usually in the middle of it. Morton has to be one of the best and most underrated actors on prime time TV. He has played on every prime time show imaginable from CSI: NY and the original Law & Order to the X-Files (episode 1, 2000).

Secondly, if you watch shows because of beautiful women, then this is the show for you. Eureka has three of the most beautiful women on primetime TV.

  Allison Blake is a co-star played by Salli Richardson-Whitfield. Salli plays an agent of the federal govt. who acts as the liaison between the federal govt. and Eureka. She is smart, professional, and a goddess.

  Then there is Beverly Barlowe played by Debrah Farentino. Beverly is the town therapist / Inn owner who is also some kind of secret agent. Her sex appeal seeps from the TV. Its unbelievable that she is not a bigger star than she is.

  Last there is Deputy Jo Lupo played by actress Erica Cerra. Jo is Jack Carter's Gung Ho Deputy who thinks she is the next Dirty Harry. She is a little Tom Boy-ish, but even that can't hide her beauty.

The layout and the setting of this show is great. It has just the right amount of fresh new ideas mixed with some traditional themes of TV. For instance there is a ""thing""  between Carter and Blake that somewhat remind me of ""Who's The Boss""

Overall this is one of the best shows on night time TV, both cable and major networks. If you missed the first season, order it now watch it, and be prepared for season 2.",1177113600,46,2109,4.472584856396867
2802338,4,B000OY8NII,"I liked Eureka, the series that premeired on Sci-Fi last summer.  It was a very refreshing look at super-geniuses and their special problems that they face while hiding from the world at large. Colin Ferguson plays the now Sheriff Jack Carter, of the wonder-town who looks at these eccentrics with a cocked-eye and tongue firmly in cheek humor but who realizes that they must have their freedom to conduct their sometimes planetary projects.  The show is blessed with a solid cast that has only tapped into what they can achieve. While Carter views their 'eccentricies' wide-eyed, I wonder how long that will continue. They also need to create a good adversary for him, along with problems that could confront super geniuses. So far the problems they have dealt with have been X-Files like in concept and the show needs to develop problems that would humble super geniuses.  That doesn't mean it isn't a good show, it needs a storyline to follow through now.",1176163200,15,958,4.865030674846626
2802339,5,B000OY8NII,"Welcome to EUREKA, the weirdest town in America, and also the title to the Sci-Fi Channel's inventive, breath of fresh air television series. Here's the set-up: When U.S. Marshal Jack Carter (Colin Ferguson) transports his rebellious, runaway daughter Zoey (Jordan Hinson) home in his custody, an auto accident lands him and his charge in Eureka, a top-secret, rustic town populated by eccentrics and genius scientists. Carter immediately becomes aware of Eureka's uniqueness as embodied in its odd residents who are more than they seem: an auto mechanic who's also a space shuttle engineer, a beautiful innkeeper who doubles as a psychotherapist, children who give intricate directions and who write mathematical formulas on the sidewalk...Added to the peculiar sights he witnesses, Carter's interest is further piqued when his offers to help the local constabulary in a missing child case is summarily rebuffed.

In due course, he does learn the secret of Eureka, of which origin dates back to Albert Einstein and Harry S. Truman, who, after World War 2 and the scare of the atomic bomb, decided to build the tiny town as a safe haven and a workplace for our nation's greatest thinkers. In the fifty years of Eureka's existence, its residents have been hugely responsible for most of today's technological advances. But, of course, not everything can be a bonafide success. Global warming, for example, has been touted as one side effect of one experimental goof in Eureka. Sworn to secrecy, Jack Carter proves to be instrumental in resolving a horrific scientific project gone awry, impressing the powers-that-be enough that he ends up as the new Sheriff of Eureka.

The series is colorfully flavored with a host of idiosyncratic characters effectively brought to life by a good cast: Carter's mutinous daughter Zoey (Jordan Hinson); the beautiful, gung-ho ex-Army Ranger and current Deputy Sheriff Josefina ""Jo"" Lupo (Erica Cerra, with whom I think I'm in love); Department of Defense agent Allison Blake (Salli Richardson-Whitfield), who toils as the government liaison between Eureka and the Pentagon and who, by the way, looks muy caliente in her pink undies; Nathan Stark (Ed Quinn), the icy, controlling head researcher of Global Dynamics and also Allison's husband; the insightful and sexy psychotherapist Beverly Barlowe (Debrah Farentino), who has dark secrets of her own; genial guy and mechanical genius Henry Deacon (Joe Morton), who slums as a car mechanic; the unstable Aussie Jim Taggart (Matt Frewer), the self-styled  ""biological containment specialist""; and young Douglas Fargo (Neil Grayston), the bespectacled, sycophant computer geek. By the way, solely from a red-blooded dude's perspective, it's always appreciated when three gorgeous females are featured regularly in the same show, and Richardson-Whitfield, Farentino, and Cerra contribute in lifting EUREKA to new heights of must-see-TV-ness.

Colin Ferguson's performance as Sheriff Jack Carter provides the bridge and the grounding point of view for the audience. As the witty, perceptive, and sometimes lost-at-sea Sheriff, he hits all the right notes here. His normal guy reactions to the endless slew of strangeness surrounding him are believable and, at times, hilarious. There's some nice verbal sparring (read: sexual tension) between Carter and Allison, but I particularly relish the chemistry *snicker* between Carter and his fully automated, hermetically sealed, very vocal military bunker/smart house, S.A.R.A.H.

As a television series, EUREKA proved to be the highest-rated show on the Sci-Fi Channel of 2006, beating out the equally excellent, revamped BATTLESTAR GALACTICA. This exuberant show is equal parts X-FILES, TWILIGHT ZONE, STAR TREK and NORTHERN EXPOSURE in its playful quirkiness and forays into the weird; not to mention, the whistly, whimsical theme tune puts you immediately in sync with the show's oddball frequency.

These are some of the tried and true sci-fi themes that are touched on: ESP, cloning, cell regeneration, mind manipulation, death rays, super speed, AIs, and nanotechnology. The laudable special effects are there when needed but do not overwhelm the show; the episodes are engrossing, if a bit warped at times, and the season's main story arc, involving the super  secret Section 5 and something called the Artifact, promises to go somewhere. I'm so glad the Sci-Fi Channel decided to renew this series for a second season. So, if you want to catch a show where crazy quantum physics regularly run amok, where wild inventions surface on a daily basis which are, by the way, gadgety cool enough to make even James Bond swoon, and where cheerleaders spout theorems and school nerds run the school, and also where the world is constantly threatened by the scientific lab toys of Eureka's brilliant but erratic personalities...well, then, yes, get your geek on and give EUREKA: SEASON ONE a whirl.",1175644800,326,4921,5.366580310880829
2802340,3,B000OY8NII,"Si-fi Romance. This series was clearly written by women or people who have no insight to male behavior. The men, and especially the protagonist Carter, are all. in tune with a woman's feelings and know what women want. Even the rogue who is in love with the JoJo is a broad. That's right, broad. The ""MEN"" in this story are a bunch of broads. They're brave but they're way too sensitive.
 Women are in charge most of the time in this super sensitive place crated by a world controlled by men. I think this show seeks to put men in their place by feminist.
Still. It's a fun show once you learn to looks past the weak men.",1526342400,,621,4.262711864406779

2802348,5,B000OY8NII,"I really enjoyed this series. The characters are likeable and the show is cleverly written. It operates in its own parallel universe. Eureka is a company town in Oregon which does scientific R&D for the U.S. government. There is a lot of scientific mumbo jumbo. The drama is usually created by research projects that go wrong. Eurekas residents are brilliant and geeky but also slightly nuts. The Sheriff is one of the few people with an IQ under 140, but his common sense often saves the day.

It is a gentle, quirky comedy, but people occasionally die. Colin Ferguson is a likable Sheriff. All the actors do a good job making the unbelievable seem believable.  Highly recommended.",1525478400,,682,4.82051282051282

2802352,5,B000OY8NII,"Decade +later, rewatching this show which was a fave of mine, it Still is great fun to watch. Not every episode ""hits it out of the park"", but, the chemistry on-screen between actors/actresses is wonderful, only a few minor pitfalls n fails here n there, but, overall, just a GOOD show.
Its Sci Fi meets Days of our Lives, with great underscored comedy sprinkled throughout.

The tech side isn't quite as strong TODAY as it was when it was made, but it was pretty solid when it came out. But, its still quite watchable, very good fun, a lot more hits than misses by far. I was VERY sorry to see this show, and wish with all the reboots going on, they would reboot this, with as much of the original cast as possible. A goodly number of loose ends could be brought back into a new series, along with a great many new storylines, maybe even hinting at some of the other shows, or having someone from those make a guest appearance on this one, like ""The Arrow"", for one, be a perfect match, his character ends up in Eureka, needing some high-tech help, which also ends up being against an enemy Eureka didn't know they had.. so right there you could run several episodes together, and tie later ones back in.

Watch it.. its just good, its sexy, funny, a bit tragic and sad... all the elements of a well rounded show, it just happens to revolve around Sci Fi",1525305600,,1355,4.373015873015873

The story line may be interesting but the initial set up is so stupid that I didn't even care what came next .  Here are a few things I found wrong:
Smart alecky girl is like every other smart alecky girl in film
Marshall is tall and fairly good looking while sheriff if not
Deputy is good looking woman who with a twist of her wrist takes out the marshall
Dept of Defense person (why would she even be in this town) is very good looking woman with cleavage
The parents who own the motor home did not notice that the back half  of it had been blown off before they got into it
Owner of the B&B is very pretty and has even more cleavage

Like others have said, I really don't get all of the 4-5 star reviews. This series won't cause you to think, offer anything new, or stretch your imagination.

After episode 5, I just couldn't do it anymore. ""We only use 10% of our brain."" Reaaaaaaaaaallllly? Remember this is suppose to be about the most intelligent people on earth.

""The popular notion that large parts of the brain remain unused, and could subsequently be ""activated"", rests in popular folklore and not science.

And after buying the DVDs and watching it again now I can remember why we thought that, it just takes a bit to get going, but once it does, somewhere in the second half of this season, it does get better.  This is a really good show, the premise and story lines are fun and unique, the characters are funny and likable, and it's just good sci-fi. Since this season is a bit slow I would say it's probably the worst season, but that's just a matter of the show mostly only getting better over time, so this season is good, but the later seasons are great, like season 4 is my personal favorite.  The one thing that I would say is bad about this show is that the DVDs have some of the worst packaging I've ever seen, the case for this season had a few broken spots, most notably the place where the insert for the first and second discs connects.  Overall if you're looking for a sci-fi show that's not the average space opera or dystopian fare than this is a great candidate and I do recommend it, especially the later seasons.",1503360000,,1228,4.212765957446808

The DVD set I received all episodes are tinted green and pink. It's really distracting it makes the sky green and Zoeys hair bright pink. I waited too late to open my set to send it back but be careful and check right away with the right color it's a great show.",1496707200,3,488,3.979591836734694

2802437,5,B000OY8NII,"Eureka grabbed me right away with the fun, quirky music by Mutato Muzika, and then Bear Mcreary, the same guy whos done the music on Battlestar Galactica, Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles, Black Sails, Outlander, Black Mirror, and the list goes on.

Season one of Eureka was great. If it had lasted just one season it would be on my list of one season wonder sci-fi shows like Firefly, The Prisoner, UFO, Brisco County, Jr., Eerie, Indiana, Jericho, etc. But it went on, dropping some of the funniest characters, and turned into the Allison Blake show. Nathan Stark, out of there. Beverly Barlowe, out of there. Spencer Martin, out of there. Jim Taggart, out of there.

And then they got rid of Zoe Carter! But they had to bring her back for the last season, season five, so they could end the series with a bookend, a mirror image of Zoe and her father driving out of town, passing themselves driving into town, which is how the series began.

Even the addition of the Wil Wheaton and Felicia Day characters couldn't rescue this series after they turned it into the Allison Blake show.

2802484,5,B000OY8NII,"The very first time I tried to watch this on the SY-FY channel I couldn't finish the pilot episode. I don't remember why but I suspect it had more to do with my frame of mind than the show because... eventually I got a second chance and not only watched the entire episode but I was totally hooked. The characters are great, appealing, funny and believable. The situations they get into are funny and mostly well-thought out. The setting, fictional Eureka Oregon, is beautiful and made me want to move there. I have watched the first 4 seasons repeatedly. Sometimes I play them as background as I cook. Sometimes I need a little mood lift, a feel good, and most of the episodes from the first 4 seasons are perfect for that.
If your only experience with Eureka is from Season 5 on Amazon then you are really really missing out. In my opinion that is the least enjoyable season. It always seems to throw a monkey wrench into a good show when the writers/producers run out of ideas and inevitably someone has to pop out a kid. In this case its Dr Allison Blake. And I wasn't at all thrilled with the whole Titan/Astraeus mission.",1475625600,,1127,4.475728155339806

2802554,5,B000OY8NII,"One of my all time top 5 favorite shows. Watching it again with my Tweener has been just as much a thrill as it was the first time around. (There are a few gross outs and sexual innuendo. If your Tweener isn't on the mature side, you might want to wait a bit. I think it's rated PG-13.) These story lines are fresh and interesting. There is no laugh track needed, you'll be in stitches at least twice just in the pilot episode. The dialog is extremely quick and witty, and the characters so well developed that it's impossible to pick favorites. We love them all for their distinct personalities and quirks, so familiar already, that we can guess their reactions to certain situations, if not their words. We love it when we guess wrong, we love it when we guess right. It's light and fun, but it does create curiosity and does provoke thoughtful discussion from time to time. All in all, this is what television entertainment SHOULD be. If it were more often the case, I might actually watch more than twice a year. For now though, on to season two with many thanx to writers, producers, directors, cast and crew. EXCELLENT show!",1468800000,,1130,4.517073170731707

The actors and actresses really get comfortable with each other and in later seasons do an amazing job at 'switching body' acting, you can tell how well they know each others characters. Some episodes are better than others. Like, much better. The 'to be continued' episodes are the best. 5 stars for those episodes.

I just wish Amazon would actually allow us to download these shows onto our Android tablets so we can watch them without the internet/WiFi connections.

I watched all five seasons, about a year or so ago, FREE with my Prime membership.  After seeing Colin Ferguson (Sheriff Carter) in those Maytag commercials I decided to watch the five seasons again.  I was shocked to find they were no longer free!  Then I got mad.  I have put many 'free' movies on my watch list but never got around to watching them. I would say a good 75% were no longer free.  Amazon is getting too greedy!  So, if I want to watch all five seasons that would cost $100?  Excuse me?  That is ridiculous!  I can understand charging for fairly new or current movies and TV shows - but they are charging for just about everything that is worth watching.

You did this to be a couple months ago with ALL BBC shows, too. A little warning would be nice. It seems pointless to write another customer service email about my dismay with this show when all my last one got me was a polite apology and nothing else.

  Then came season 2.  I got to watch 3 episodes.  The next night I logged in to watch my next 3 episodes and . . . Amazon pulled the rug out from under me.  Yep, overnight they made Season 2 thru 5 all Pay-Per-Episode!  Thanks for nothing Amazon!
  The video arm of the Prime Membership SUCKS!  They rarely ever have anything new on there thats covered under Prime.  Most everything on there is pay-per-view.  The app on the Ps3 is poor.  Every time you click on anything it takes about 10 seconds for the next page to appear VS about 4 seconds on NetFlix.  SLOW.  DO NOT BUY PRIME MEMBERSHIP EXPECTING PERFORMANCE AND TITLES YOU GET ON NetFlix.  YOU WILL be dissappointed!",1432080000,13,980,4.344444444444444

2802739,1,B000OY8NII,"Beware Potential Amazon Prime Members!
Amazon's delivery of the first few episodes of Eureka season one was adequate.  But potential Prime members beware!  If nothing else, Amazon is not stupid.  Be prepared to watch a few episodes, but don't be surprised if the series you are watching (in this case Eureka) is suddenly available only for purchase, outside the scope of your Prime membership.  While I can find no faults with the few individual episodes we watched, we started watching the series with the expectation that we could watch it to the end without suddenly having to pay for each episode.

2802918,5,B000OY8NII,Love the show and can't wait for next season.,1430611200,,45,4.111111111111111
2802919,5,B000OY8NII,This one has a great writer/writers! I haven't been able to find the who yet. Story's are wonderfully imaginative. And love this team of actors and actresses. I am fully entertained so far.,1430438400,,189,4.757575757575758

2802934,5,B000OY8NII,I absolutely adore this show. i can watch it over and over again. I am so sad that they ended it.,1430438400,,97,3.6666666666666665

2802940,5,B000OY8NII,"I really miss this show!  Watching Eureka is like taking a vacation.  It's science meets comedy, with some of the best writing and acting on TV.  The sheriff is the guy next door attempting to cope and fit in, with some of the smartest people on the planet.  He thought he was taking another job  with the same type of police work that he'd been used to, and finds himself dealing with the most outrageous situations!  The town of Eureka is a ""think tank"" for the government.  Each scientist is working on something different.  Some experiments go as planned, others, take on a life of their own!  The result is an enjoyable one hour show!  I promise, you won't be disappointed!!!",1430352000,,680,4.545454545454546
2802941,5,B000OY8NII,One of my favorite TV series. Though season 2 is the best in my opinion.,1430352000,,72,3.8666666666666667

2802955,4,B000OY8NII,"A little campy, but it's still fun and entertaining.  The Artifact/Kevin arc and the Beverly/Kim arc move a little slowly for my taste.  Very little new information from show to show.  Lots of Stargate supporting actors show up on this show, which is kind of fun if you were a fan of that show--usually one actor per episode.  And Carter's relationship with his daughter is a little hard to take.  The show gets kind of schmaltzy with the feelings sometimes, and I could do without that.  There was one scene where I thought somebody was going to sing, and as my husband said, ""There's no singing in sci fi.""  So if you can get over those kinds of issues, it's a pretty good show.",1430265600,,680,4.435483870967742

During the pilot, the series shows an interesting script (for a SyFy type of history) relating hi-sci themes with personal and family issues
After defining the sheriff role, based on the pilot, the script become repetitive and only changes collateral issues keeping intact the central history, becoming predictable
It's just an option to consider if you're a sci-fi fanatic and have little-to-none to do
It's value is four stars instead of three because it's clearly offered as scientific-fiction entertainment",1429488000,,583,5.3478260869565215

I love being able to start from the beginning of Season One, I love the lack of commercials, I love being able to watch several episodes in a row on a weekend night.  I prefer these 45-minutes episodes to watching movies.
Anyway, we like this show, it's an interesting premise that allows for lots of new things to happen in the same smalltown setting, the characters are likeable and they and their relationships evolve, it's a clean show - no bad language or risque situations.

The actors have great chemistry, the plots are smart and fun, there is humor and suspense in most every story...best of all, they didn't drag it on forever.

Always a mystery going on and a cast of characters that get along well (in their own way).
I missed this show when it was on previously but I don't think that I could have stomached the long commercial breaks that must have been programmed into the show.
Most of these shows run 43 minutes - so that would leave 17 minutes of commercials per show.
It is so great to be able to watch these shows without all the commercials. I wonder if the producers realize how disrupting commercials actually are.
At any rate, here on Amazon Prime you can enjoy these shows commercial free and truly enjoy the show.

Also the stories and dialogue sound credible. That is to say, it does not come across like the problems and solutions are completely beyond reason.

2803347,5,B000OY8NII,"Eureka (tv series) I was immediately drawn to this show. The acting is excellent, the direction is tight, the dialogue is believable scientifically and the interplay is often humorous. The core cast has different  actors featured often only once an episode who do a great job, fitting in seamlessly. My favorite episode on Season 1 is ""Alienation"".  I also liked ""Purple Haze"". Although some characters are injured or even die in this show, there is very little focus on disgusting sights and there is no incessant sound of gunfire, most incidents result as accidents. Also, it's filmed in a lovely location. It has a background story but each episode is complete, and sometimes is referenced later. If I had to compare this to another series, I'd say ""Buffy"", but in this show, there is nothing ""alien""  or ""supernatural"". The scientists' projects are the cause of the town's troubles. The resolutions may seem farfetched, and that is where the fantasy is...the hero always comes through. I like that, compared to  the increasingly gloomy dystopian stuff.",1425081600,,1056,5.051724137931035

2803352,5,B000OY8NII,"This is an excellent series.  If you enjoyed it the first time around, you will find it just as good now.  In fact, it is even better now because you don't have to wait through commercial breaks!

For those of you too young to remember this series, it is a fun and wacky adventure of a former law enforcement officer and his bratty, but brilliant daughter moving to Eureka.  As the new Sheriff, our beloved hero finds that he is trying to ""herd"" a bunch of nerdy scientists who think doing experiments that frequently blow up, change the time continuum, etc., is a normal event.

Each episode the main character, a US Marshall who is now the sheriff of this quirky town filled with scientific geniuses, finds himself confronted by some strange event generally related to some experiment gone wrong. There is an underlying plot that is slowly revealing itself that keeps you watching.

The characters are fun and the writing is cleaver enough to keep the show interesting. If you like sci-fi and are willing to let some things go you will enjoy the show.",1424390400,3,557,4.742268041237113

Main player or players get sick or injured and have to find a way to cure them, town and/or research lab may have to be evacuated before destruction, cop yes a high school grad cop saves everyone and everything in the last five min.  Is supposed to be a syfi but almost all episodes are related to paranormal, misunderstood sicence, and religion. A town full of PhDs and scientist who are imbeciles.

2803629,5,B000OY8NII,"If all of TV could be excellent, this show would be a part of that.  Love, LOVE, love this si fi ish pre-courser to Fringe.  Only the 2nd show and I already know I will be binge watching all seasons.  Getting Amazon Prime is worth it just for being able to watch this come and gone show I never got to see originally.  Also, I  FINALLY got to watch the Sopranos - the entire series from start to finish and Sons of Anarchy 1-6, but haven't decided to pay for 7 yet.  With the exception of ""Orange is the New Black"" on Netflix, I already love Prime.  Just be sure to check out the entire library.  You will find some hidden gems like this show, and other shows you have forgotten about.  I haven't had cable in years an now feel I am catching up on some of the ""best of"".  HBO ""Carnival"" is another gem if you haven't watched it yet.  Its went only 2 seasons which is sad, cuz it was that GOOD.  I still won't get cable, due to the outrageous monthly fees, but hooking up the TV to my computer makes up for it.  Watch this Series - EXCELLENT like Fringe was in the beginning, until it got weak and then weird at the end, and the series last show was disappointing.",1422316800,,1163,4.092920353982301

2803631,5,B000OY8NII,good,1421020800,,4,4.0
2803632,5,B000OY8NII,"loved just about every episode. I like the series and it's related shows like warehouse 13 & alphas. It's a shame the scifi channel (SyFy) is starting to axe most of the good shows for lame reality shows. Seems like other big cable networks are starting to follow this trend to like the history channel.

It's a good science fiction show with a great plot & great characters. It's set in a small fictional town in Oregon called Eureka it is all about an average U.S. Marital turned sheriff of Eureka by order of Washington DC. Just about every episode is pretty entertaining. Some characters leave but sometimes come back later on occasions. If you ask me it ended to early. It should have gotten another five seasons but at least they gave it an ending.",1420934400,,754,4.544117647058823
2803633,5,B000OY8NII,"I'm only 6 episodes into Eureka, but it's just as great as I thought it would be back when it first aired and I didn't have time to watch it.  The first episode threw me a bit and I almost turned it off; everything was too chaotic and unexplained.  Then the main idea was finally introduced, and I was hooked!

This is not a show for folks who want everything very literal and at least somewhat realistic.  It's more like fantasy on steroids set down into a mostly realistic setting.  The characters are fun and enjoyable, and the plots are wonderfully wild!

Love it!",1420675200,,568,4.413461538461538
2803634,5,B000OY8NII,"Love Eureka! Funny, smart and sometimes really makes you think.  I looked up the Akashic Field, it is a theory by Ervin Laszlo. I thought the writers made that up.",1420675200,,163,4.433333333333334

2803681,5,B000OY8NII,"Eureka snares you from the first episode with truly likeable and quirky characters.  Granted the premise of the ordinary guy bringing the geniuses down to earth each and every episode is a feel good trope, but its done so well that it amuses you from start to finish.  The characters develop along lines that are engaging and sincere, while providing a great deal of tongue in cheek humor about science being allowed to play freely.

 I'm usually not one for ""Family shows"" as they tend to stray into silly extremes of core values but Eureka sets itself apart as solid entertainment that is suitable for families while keeping us cynical adults equally entertained.  And if you don't fall madly in love with Jo by the end of the first season, then there's just something wrong with the wiring in your head.",1420502400,,806,4.6879432624113475

What's nice about the show is it had me googling physics terminology and prompted me to read ""Alice in Quantumland!""

2803712,5,B000OY8NII,"I loved Eureka.  It is quirky funny with the sheriff's deadpan one liners and ""lower"" intelligence than the super geeks surrounding him.

Eureka is the home of the world most brilliant scientists whose experiments sometimes (OK every episode) go awry.  The local sheriff, Jack Carter, is a down to earth non-scientist whose job is to unravel the messes those crazy scientists create.  Silly in spots but mostly entertaining.  The actors (Colin Ferguson as Sheriff Jack Carter particularly) make you care about what happens on the show.

The stories were intriguing, the characters were funny and appealing, and the special effects very well done. I won't review the series premise, because that's already done, but I will write that we loved this series and never missed an episode except the last few, and only then because we were moving  across the country at the time!  We loved how the story-lines gave excellent background of actual historically significant events in real-life science. The characters, many brilliant, were also very human, and made many mistakes while attempting great things. Sheriff Carter made the whole show, and we love this actor.",1416009600,,773,5.03125

Everybody in town is like the dad from ""Honey I shrunk the Kids"".  I think the 2 hour pilot could of been a movie at the box office, on it's own merit. Some unexplained things happen that don't get answered, or addressed, in each episode, so you know they are going to come back to be an issue down the road in later shows. I like the fact that each episode has a start and ending, like a normal show. The plot goes on, but each show has a new problem solved and ends with an outcome. I like it that way, so you don't spend an entire weekend watching a series just to see what happens next. Uh, you know, like Breaking Bad, or 24.",1415923200,,772,4.078947368421052

2804857,5,B000OY8NII,"Wow. What a great show.

I admit, it's a bit dumb at times, for being a show about a town full of geniuses. It's a soap opera for nerds, overly romantic and sentimental, and sometimes cloyingly sweet.

Nearly every episode involves the protagonists being the cause of impending doom, whether it's doom to an intimate relationship or the destruction of all life on Earth, and then having the same characters help solve the problem they just created. It gets kind of predictable after a while, throws around the idiot-ball a lot, and then forgets about things that would be pretty major in real life (Mission to Titan? Totally forgotten as soon as it happens. Yeah, they were distracted by *everything-that-was-happening-in-the-plot*, but COME ON! FTL travel to Titan?!?!?!?!?)

But, I can't not love the dorky love that was put into this series, or the fact that, despite its flaws, it was able to survive for a whole 5 seasons. The characters actually develop. They didn't do the thing of ""boy chases girl"" but never allow him to catch her because it's such a useful plot device. Boys and girls actually catch each other. Whooo!

And then, the writers use alternate realities/mind swaps/whatever as a cheap plot device to reset all of that. Booo!

But, I still can't not love it. This show is adorable. I want to pat its fuzzy, flawed little head. It's obvious the creators had a passion for the show and its characters, as well as the whole geek-o-sphere, as opposed to a passion of making fun at the expense of nerds (like the embarrassingly insulting show Big Bang Theory).

The showrunners embraced fantasy and creativity you don't often see in a show that's been given this much production value, or lasted this many seasons with this many episodes. The actors are obviously loving their jobs, and hamming it up in all the best possible ways. There should be more shows like this.",1413331200,,1885,4.7846153846153845

2804860,5,B000OY8NII,"Thanks to my Amazon TV, I got a chance to try Eureka for free.  I had passed on the show, as the advertising I'd seen made it look like a kids show.

Was I wrong.  This is anything but.  They are dealing with very mature subjects, and is surprisingly good.  This is one of the first TV shows that I've seen in which interracial relationships are just relationships.  At my age, that's really unusual to see, and shows how the culture has changed.  I do have to agree that Beverly really takes you in a direction that you sure don't expect her to do so.  Characters are complicated.  Is Stark a good guy?  Bad guy?  Both?",1413072000,,620,4.258620689655173

2804949,4,B000OY8NII,"This show is what my wife likes to call ""Good Crap"". It's non-threatening, lighthearted, and entertaining enough to keep me watching. But it is by no means exceptional, like a suspense/thriller like Breaking Bad, or dramatically textured, like the Sci-Fi of Defiance.  Episode to episode it is generally predictable: An invention at General Dynamics gets out of control, the Sheriff solves it. There is light humor scattered through it and enough nerd-friendly premises to keep it's base audience tuned in.

While I am only midway through season 3, it does seem like the writers are still struggling to find the main arc of the show, and there is a sense that the producers are still searching for the stride and not really taking cues from what has already been established..as a result, the show never feels like it takes on a life of it's own. . Characters get introduced and written out frequently..not unusual, but in some cases WITHOUT EXPLANATION..not even a line of script to explain it. At the end of Season 2, Carter starts a relationship with a very nice woman..it continues for a few episodes, and then boom, she's gone like she was never there. They also seem to try out various romantic combinations and then let them drop without explanation. Lupo and Taggart were getting into a thing in Season 2..then suddenly, they are not. No script explains it..then they hook Lupo up with someone else, and never develop it further beyond the courtship stages. The character development plot lines remain unresolved much of the time. They also endlessly tinker with having a stable antagonist. The one in the pilot doesn't make it to the 2nd episode, then Stark, then they humanize Stark to the point where he can no longer be an antagonist, and after half a season with no real antagonist, they introduce a cutthroat corporate antagonist.

The main romantic arc, the relationship between Blake and Carter, never seems to find a footing. They are heading for love and then arent..then are again, then arent. I get building sexual tension like Mulder and Scully, and I get building relationship drama like Ross and Rachel..but after 3 seasons there is really no direction with them either way.

Still, episode to episode it is good light entertainment.",1412121600,,2256,4.913385826771654
2804950,5,B000OY8NII,"I was pleasantly surprised by this series. I had thought earlier that this was another series like the very disappointing Haven series, but in this series we combine good acting and a very good and clever script. Each show pretty much stands alone, after we get the introduction to the quirky characters in Eureka. Having these characters creates a number of possibilities. I particularly enjoyed the conflicts between the town and the company, and the ultimate outcomes of each event.",1412121600,2,485,5.075

The only reason it was not renewed is because the SciFi channel was bought out and they didn't want to finance the show, even though it was their most popular show.  The characters are wonderful. My favorite is Henry Deacon. I love how they come together to solve problems even though they are from different backgrounds and perspectives. Geeks will not be disappointed.

2805003,5,B000OY8NII,"I got this primarily so I could bone up for the crossover episode in season 2 of Warehouse 13, but this turned out to be a really good show with plenty of likeable characters, quirky humor and interesting storylines.  My aunt even likes watching it with me.  Heres an episode guide, with synopsizes from the DVD box.

1.  Pilot:  After U.S. Marshall Jack Carter and his fugitive daughter find themselves lost on a lonely back road, their chance arrival in an odd small town will change their travel plans forever.  This is better than the pilots for Warehouse 13 and Alphas.  A+

2.  Many Happy Returns:  Home sweet home gets a new twist when Jack moves into a smart house with a mind of its own, and a former resident of Eureka returns to find out why shes been reported dead.  A

3.  Before I forget:  Memory lapses prove deadly when Jack suspects a visiting scientist of tampering with residents minds for his own benefit.  A

4.  Alienated:  Messages from outer space have some Eureka residents convinced that a visiting legislator is much more dangerous than he seems.  B+

5.  Invincible:  When an accidental lab explosion destroys years of research on cellular regeneration, a sensitive scientist finds himself biochemically altered beyond his wildest dreams.
A+

6. Dr. Nobel:
When Fargo accidentally activates long-forgotten Cold War missiles, its up to Jack to find the computers source before Eureka becomes a giant crater.  This isn't the best episode, but its not bad.  B

7.  Blink:  Jacks in the ultimate race for survival when some Section 5 employees access a top-secret drug that makes them too speedy to catch.  A

8. Right as Raynes:  Rebellious behavior has Jack scratching his head when Zoe acts out while he traces an annoying citywide computer glitch to a charismatic programmer.  An excellent episode, with a touching ending.  A+

9. Primal:  The fate of Eureka depends on a kiss when Jack discovers that robot nanoids have begun replicating themselves, and the only way to stop them is to make Stark jealous by kissing Allison.  This would have been a good episode, if it weren't for the fact that Taggerts incompetence probably lead to the problem of the week (A couple people getting killed is on his head, and he doesnt seem to feel anything.).  If he had properly put the lid on the nanoids and they still managed to escape it would have been a pretty good episode.  C-

10.  Purple Haze:  Change is in the air when Eureka residents wake up after a typically calm night with absolutely none of their former inhibitions.  A+

11.  H.O.U.S.E. Rules:  House-hunting takes on a new meaning when Jack, Allison, Stark, Beverly, Fargo and Henry are trapped in the smart house with its devilish alter ego, B.R.A.D.  Like with Primal this episode is one scene away from being good.  There are plenty of great scenes, but one ruins it for me (I don't want to spoil it; youll probably know it when you see it).  C

12.  Once in a Lifetime:  The space-time continuum is severely tested when the 2,010 residents of Eureka discover theyve been living in an alternate timeline and the real future is encroaching on their idyllic world.  An excellent season finale.  A+

I ordered season 2 after watching the first 8 episodes, and am really looking forward to it and the future seasons, especially the episodes Crossing Over (where Claudia from Warehouse 13 goes to Eureka) and Do You See What I See (which sounds awesome).",1410998400,3,3437,4.735593220338983

2805160,5,B000OY8NII,"I am really loving the Eureka television series. It is full of surprises, and it's like a city full of MENSA members (or even OATHS Society members or Triple Nine Society members) surrounding an average sheriff.

(Maybe one of the reasons I like this series is because I was a member of Mensa, and am a member of the other two groups, though I'm nowhere near as smart as some of these characters are written to me.

The whole series started with the not yet sheriff (a federal agent) accidently getting stuck in Eureka, then being able to help them solve some problems. By the end of the first episode, the former sheriff (who we later found out was a high up in the federal hierarchy) wanted the new one to come to Eureka permanently. A promotion from federal officer to county sheriff. Weird.

Strange things happen all the time in Eureka, and it's like a weekly mystery, solving scientific problems while dealing with emotional and personal issues, including a daughter with whom he learns how to be a better parent.

I highly recommend this series.",1407542400,,1052,4.639784946236559

2805179,3,B000OY8NII,"The Sci-Fi aspect of this show is a format that can add some spice to the series, but like many Sci-Fi programs, the actual writing is still just pedestrian.  To me, good Sci-Fi needs to effectively blend in how the innovations impact and change society.  Consider how cell phones and Wi-Fi have so drastically changed out current society, just from what it was twenty years ago.

I consider this show to have ""Average"" everything.  Nothing special about it, and nothing really bad.",1407196800,,482,4.841463414634147

2805240,5,B000OY8NII,"With insipid TV programming on during prime time my wife and I decided to search Amazon for a movie or TV series. What we found was a series named Eureka and Eureka was engaging. After watching  a very strange couple of episodes we were hooked. To say it was quirky-an understatement. My wife and I enjoyed the series all the way to the end of Season Five. Entertaining and confusing at times  but totally enjoyable.  Eureka is the name of a very strange town. We decided that we  wouldn't want to live there. Even staying there overnight might be a  problem  but we plan to watch it again down the road.
There were a couple of weak episodes but overall we give 5 Stars to the series.",1406419200,,684,4.346456692913386

While the plot stales over the course of the seasons, and the show jumps the shark towards the end of the run, it's just a fun-to-watch mind-candy show.  Unfortunately, the characters soon turn into  caricatures that repeat the same behaviors over and over again.  A bit like watching a nerdy version of Gilligan's Island.

2805357,5,B000OY8NII,I started watching Eureka just to check it out and then became hooked. I really enjoy science and cutting edge tech which makes this show entertaining for peeps like me. Collin Ferguson does a great job with his role as Sheriff of a town made entirely of genius scientists who seem to always end up causing more trouble than good on their way toward scientific breakthroughs . I definitely recommend all seasons of Eureka and can think of only one down side.....there are only has 5 seasons. Hope you decide to watch.,1403654400,,517,4.630434782608695

2805370,5,B000OY8NII,Eureka has been one of my all time favorite shows!  What fun to relax after a long school year and watch the first season again.  I laughed all the way through it!,1402099200,,163,4.0625

2805374,4,B000OY8NII,"This series has the typical flaws of TV shows--the main characters always doing everything as if there are no other people qualified (like when doing all the experiments or taking blood samples), and , some of the same interpersonal story lines drag on ad nauseum (will she ever really be him, etc.), and an endless stream of suspicious expendable, often ""red shirt,"" murders or accident victims (like when the pizza guy, actually wearing a red shirt was blown to bits by the rogue house). However, it is unique in that the dialogue is refreshingly realistic and there is enough science fiction geeky stuff satisfy any sci-fi buff with a sense of humor. There is usually a plausible of the possible juxtaposed with the impossible. Current events are tackled and characters are not evenly slotted between good and evil, everyone has his/her faults. Enjoy!",1401926400,,854,4.979020979020979
2805375,5,B000OY8NII,Very enjoyable show. Can watch with the whole family. Watched the whole first season over a couple of days. My boys were looking for another show to watch after they finished Psyche.,1401840000,,182,4.71875

It's good to know that someone came up with the idea of using smart humans in their place.  But it's still sci-fi & you have to be willing to suspend reality.  Very professionally produced.  No Ed Wood ancestry at all.",1401840000,,313,4.849056603773585

2805384,3,B000OY8NII,Five seasons should mean something.  I keep hoping it will get better but I've lost faith.  Great cast/characters.  Good writing.  But so dumb.,1401667200,,143,5.086956521739131

2805387,4,B000OY8NII,"This show is interesting, mostly because of the characters.  One thing we like is this show doesn't really have a dark side although it does have some ""bad guys"".  The humor is fun.  I will say that there are times when someone ends up getting killed and it seems to be taken rather casually.  Being mildly syfy the plots are rather fanciful.",1401494400,,342,4.467741935483871

2805390,5,B000OY8NII,"The pilot has it's hiccups.  Definition of a rocky start, but fixed by the brilliant recasting of Ed Quinn to the ""heel"" GD director.  Suddenly, just about everything clicks.  He is a believable romantic interest for Allison, the perfect delivery of zingers with condescension just dripping off of them, and capable of delivering honest dialog when the situation needed it.

He was the glue that propelled the first two seasons into the realm of ""truly good"" from the ""eh, maybe"" that the pilot showed.

Writing takes advantage of the chops of all of the main cast.  Colin Ferguson is completely believable as the everyman stuck in a town of lunatics/genuises so completely out of touch with the rest of the world.  And Jordan Hinson, as his daighter Zoe, finds her stride in being more flexible with being surrounded by childhood geniuses.",1401408000,,840,4.914893617021277

2805392,5,B000OY8NII,Fun and creative police show. Sci fy twist is about technology so almost believable. Story line far fetched enough for fun watching.,1401408000,,132,5.045454545454546
2805393,5,B000OY8NII,You will want to keep watching.  IOVE this show.  To bad it was cancelled after few seasons it could have gone on forever as far as I'm concerned.  I'm in the middle of season two.,1401321600,,180,4.085714285714285

2805395,5,B000OY8NII,"I love this show.  I finally got to see the first season and how everybody came together.  Colin Ferguson as the new sheriff in town is absolutely cute and funny.  I like all of the characters, and the highly smart population of the town is not boring at all, in fact it adds to the hilarity of the situations these great minds get themselves into. You think you got something figured out on this show but you never really know what is going to happen to whom.  Highly recommend this entertainment.",1401062400,,498,4.43956043956044
2805396,5,B000OY8NII,Awesome show for the whole family. Loveable characters with memorable hi jinks. Jack Carter is the man and so is Fargo,1401062400,,118,4.666666666666667
2805397,5,B000OY8NII,"This series is ""science done light"".  The main character is an Everyman who has to deal with the mentally gifted.  It is funny, insightful into human behavior, and occasionally thought provoking.  Perfect summer fare.",1400889600,,217,5.323529411764706
2805398,4,B000OY8NII,Like the story line and the characters are funny and charming. A person can get lost in the series. I would recommend this series.,1400803200,,130,4.458333333333333

2805405,5,B000OY8NII,Watching the first season of Eureka was a great escape from the grind of the everyday mundane world.  It was nice to see some of the good actors regularly appearing in B type movies star in a good and successful series.  The story line is very inventive and plays into current cultural views and fears of the military industrial complex.  I was usually smiling throughout all the episodes as the writers combine supposedly grave situations with lots of humor.  I will definitely be watching Season 2.,1400371200,,500,4.77906976744186

2805409,1,B000OY8NII,"I watched two episodes and was lost.  Since this ran back in 2009 (or so), I must have missed it then, for good reason.  Too many twists and turns with multiple characters involved.",1400025600,,181,4.454545454545454
2805410,5,B000OY8NII,"Eureka is a great combination of humor, light romance, familial relationships and the wierdest science stories you've ever heard.

2805431,5,B000OY8NII,"Great show.

Not sure what I can add that hasn't already been said. In a nutshell,  Eureka is a small town where things are just slightly off and the first few episodes peal back the layers to reveal the wacky town for what it really is.  Our eyes and ears as we discover Eureka are the accidental newcomers, US Marshall Jack Carter and the ""prisoner"" he is driving back home.

Funny and smart Sci-fi series. Glad I have the chance to catch up with Amazon Prime. Top notch video quality while streaming as usual.",1398470400,,512,4.414893617021277

It was great scifi without the hard core blood and guts you get in almost every other show on TV these days except for romcom which I'm not into.  Jamie Paglia created a great world and great characters!  Such a shame they ended it.,1398384000,,283,4.185185185185185

2805469,5,B000OY8NII,"Set in the beautiful Pacific Northwest, Eureka is a television series with a delightful cast of characters with last names like Einstein and Oppenheimer. Carter, our main character and badly needed level-headed person, plays the new sheriff in town. He is busy putting out the fires (and explosions) created by the eccentric scientists, the government bureaucrats, and the commercial opportunists. The actors of the cast are excellent and have long lists of experience. I am always happy to see them performing in other shows, but immediately associate with their Eureka character names (ex. Mind Games: Isn't that Tess?). I'll be watching it again because it is like visiting smart, quirky, old friends.",1398297600,,704,5.294642857142857
2805470,4,B000OY8NII,"Fun to watch, but at times hard to swallow.
How can the sheriff fall from a 50 foot bridge and walk away?",1398211200,,105,3.8181818181818183
2805471,4,B000OY8NII,"Each episode is a complete story within a larger story. Good acting. You have to take all of the science
with a grain of salt.",1398038400,,126,4.08
2805472,4,B000OY8NII,I enjoyed the first season and will continue to season 2.  Carter is a entertaining and your regular guy character and among the many geniuses in Eureka he is the comedy and the heartfelt type of character a town like Eureka needs.  I just don't know how the poor guy is going to survive this town with all the crazy experimental things that keep happening and never mind the many end of the world moments that keep happening.  If you want light and entertaining this series is a go.,1398038400,,483,4.404494382022472
2805473,5,B000OY8NII,"If you like ""thought-provoking"" entertainment. You'll love Eureka.  You never know what's going to happen in Eureka, but the way the characters work together and the technology involved keeps the series interesting.  Got hooked from the first show I saw.",1397952000,,254,5.325
2805474,5,B000OY8NII,Great SF series with a comic touch and something for everyone. Like a high tech Mayberry RFD and sheriff Andy. Highly recommended.,1397952000,,130,4.954545454545454

2805476,2,B000OY8NII,I tried this show and it has no appeal to me or anyone in my family. Just not entertaining at all!  Sorry,1397779200,,105,3.772727272727273
2805477,5,B000OY8NII,Not the normal drivel of reality tv and something far more worthy of viewing time. A definite must watch for everyone.,1397606400,,118,4.666666666666667
2805478,5,B000OY8NII,Never heard of this show before finding it on Amazon Prime.  A lost gem.  Looking forward to the next few seasons on Prime.,1397520000,,123,4.304347826086956

2805481,5,B000OY8NII,"Yeah, it gets a bit wacky as seasons progress, but overall, a wonderful way to spend a rainy day or evening.  Some of the science is a bit contrived, but the people aspect, perfect.",1397347200,,181,4.323529411764706
2805482,5,B000OY8NII,"I was so sad when this series ended. I loved the interactions of all the characters, and especially the quirkiness of each individual.
I wish another series much like this one is needed.",1397347200,,186,4.666666666666667
2805483,5,B000OY8NII,"This show strikes the perfect balance for a fun and exciting scifi comedy that is not as dark as say Red Dwarf,  more along the lines of My Hero.  It's just fun to watch with non scifi fans because of the sit com settings.  Lots of fun.",1397347200,,236,3.978723404255319

2805485,4,B000OY8NII,"Eureka is escapism, not education or a reality show.
Suspend your disbelief for a while, relax and enjoy the unreal.

This is just a half a step from kiddy shows, but engaging none the less.",1397174400,,190,4.428571428571429
2805486,5,B000OY8NII,"A quirky show, it has surprising moments where you just burst out laughing and can't help but admire Sheriff Carter for holding back on expressing his real feelings about the town...till he finds that not only is he beginning to feel at home there, but that the people, who all seem to have IQ's in the 200 range, feel that he belongs too and appreciate him.

I could only catch an episode or two now and then when the show was on the air and Prime is allowing me to see them all at once.",1397174400,,488,4.136842105263158
2805487,5,B000OY8NII,"Happened upon Eureka while checking out Amazon Videos.  Golden.  I've  almost finished viewing season 5 and can feel depression setting in ... it's simple, smart, interesting and incredibly enjoyable. Consider it an afternoon delight.",1397088000,,234,5.823529411764706
2805488,5,B000OY8NII,Once I started watching the series I couldn't stop.. thanks to Prime and my Kindle Fire HDX.  I'm watching the last show of Season 1 now and have already downloaded the first five shows of Season2.,1397088000,,197,4.472222222222222
2805489,2,B000OY8NII,Found this to be boring. Can't believe it made it past season 1. Just not my type of show. Pretty part of the country though.,1397088000,,125,4.04
2805490,4,B000OY8NII,"Good character inter action.  Moves right  along at a good pace.  Escape from the day to day mundane.  It's easu tp watch, even when tired.",1396915200,,139,4.44
2805491,5,B000OY8NII,"When I say 'all time' favorites I really mean it.  It's right up there with the Little Rascals, I Love Lucy, the X-Files, and the remake of the Battlestar Galactica series.  It's highly original, features both comedy and drama, special effects and just plain good sitcom sketches, and it's a show you can watch with anyone from a sophisticated book smart person to a small child.  Though I'm a sucker for any really well done science fiction genre show, I am oh so picky, and this certainly makes the grade with me.

One small complaint though.  I've seen every episode when this was on television, and not every episode is available on Amazon.  I don't know if this is due to an error or they intentionally only include about twelve episodes out of what should be roughly eighteen.",1396915200,,782,4.630434782608695

2805493,5,B000OY8NII,I really enjoyed this series.  It was nice to see a funny show that wasn't all messed up.  I will be sure to watch for other things that Colin Ferguson is in as I think that he truly made the show.,1396828800,,197,3.7804878048780486
2805494,5,B000OY8NII,"I always liked this series however, I could rarely watch it because of time constraints. It is so nice to be able to watch when I have time. The quality of the playback is excellent !",1396656000,,183,4.111111111111111
2805495,5,B000OY8NII,This is a great series.  Think Star Trek meets Big Bang.  You won't be able to stop watching once you start,1396396800,,107,4.0476190476190474
2805496,5,B000OY8NII,"It is ""so sad"" that this series was terminated.  I believe that there were many places the plot line could have gone.  The cast seemed to be perfectly suited for the story line, the premise was great, and the fact that we had an intelligent light comedy to view made it even better.  This program is so much better than 90% of the drival we have been subjected to for the last couple of years.",1396396800,,393,4.213333333333333
2805497,4,B000OY8NII,Quirky comedy. Conspiracy theorists will relate to the story-line. It is an entertaining show with a large dose of fantasy.,1396396800,,123,5.2

2805506,5,B000OY8NII,"Among science fiction shows, this is one of the best.  Clean fun, interesting science propositions and situations, no ""monsters"" or evil aliens or gore and things that go ""boom"".  Yes, they push credibility but hey, this is scifi!",1395705600,,230,5.026315789473684

2805510,5,B000OY8NII,"Out of boredom, on a Sunday, I logged into Amazon to see what was available to watch. My wife saw this and said she heard it was supposed to be good. Well that was an understatement. After we watched the premier we ended up watching another 5 episodes and we will definitely finish this series.
If you like good, slightly quirky, shows with a sci fi twist then you will enjoy Eureka season 1.
As a side note of how much I loved this show, we do not have real broadband internet. We live in the middle of nowhere and have to use our 4g phones tethering and this was worth every megabyte of data we consumed on our wireless plan.",1395187200,,627,4.190082644628099

What kind of values are being portrayed by this small stuck up town!?  Unless you have a PHD or a badge, you're R&D fodder?  I've had enough of this uppity show and am going back to a program that respects the lower classes of society like Downtown Abbey does!!!

The characters are interesting and they reveal more each week. I also like that they didn't delve immediately into a ""bad guys"" back story. It was hinted at early but each episode gets to focus on new ""problem"".

2805560,5,B000OY8NII,"Here is a series that we had never seen before we looked around on Amazon Prime. Now we've gone through the first season and said ""This is a really funny show!"" Being a high tech feller myself, they actually blend future thinking science with the bizarre in quite an interesting manor, and with a whole lotta humor, to boot. Abusrd? Yes! Fun? Yes! Light hearted? Well - OK - we can almost go there, too.",1392681600,,403,4.386666666666667
2805561,3,B000OY8NII,"Eureka is clever and the settings and situations that occur are unique and interesting. It's not all that well acted or compelling. I enjoy watching and find it usually entertaining, but sometimes it's a take it or leave it.",1392681600,,224,4.769230769230769
2805562,5,B000OY8NII,"I rented this from a video store several years ago and loved it. But there were some sound quality issues. I was afraid this would be present on any of the dvds. But this one was great quality all around. This show will cause all manner of emotions when you go on this roller coaster ride with the characters. The plots will make you go hmmm...interesting! I would really like to live in this town and be friends with its citizens. It is filmed in Vancouver, BC and the scenery is beautiful.",1392595200,,491,4.3478260869565215

2805565,5,B000OY8NII,"Great show to keep you thinking. Eureka is witty, comical, sharp, and keeps you intrigued. Highly recommend this show to anyone looking for something more than boring, old, predictable sitcoms.",1392422400,,193,5.466666666666667
2805566,5,B000OY8NII,"Ample episodes of brilliant and goofy inventions, eccentric characters, and incredibly geeky situations make this series thoroughly entertaining. It's highlighting of characters instead of the (really sometimes very cool) technology make this enjoyable by a wide audience, including my technologically challenged wife. We both loved this show. We were both disappointed that it ended.",1392422400,,384,6.12962962962963

2805573,5,B000OY8NII,Truly love this series. The characters and storylines are great. The actors really portray their roles well. It reminds me a lot of the type of comedy that Firefly has in it.,1391990400,,174,4.46875

2805576,5,B000OY8NII,"Eureka Season 1 is a refreshing take on the old fish out of water tale. But here a ""regular"" police officer is placed into a land of scientists. But not just any capable scientists but a group of mega scientists. More brilliant than you could possibly conceive. So good they can effectively cloak the town of Eureka off the map and fom any local traffic or passerby. Even their children are potential nobel laureates. Of course wth all of this powerful knowledge comes problems. Experiments  have ""unusal"" side effects and of course there is that group from the ""other side"" that covet their abilities. So naturally as the story goes, to the rescue comes the new sheriff in town. He can't calculate his way out of a paper bag, but he is easily the monkey wrench in the  massive machine that can stop the insanity and save the day. But don't worry tommorrow is another genius error waiting to happen. A great series, it kind of gets bogged down in season 3 but it remains a good program to watch. After Season 1 you'll want to watch the rest.",1391904000,,1041,4.502645502645502

2805580,3,B000OY8NII,"Some of this is just a little outside the box.  The series as a whole is ok not the best I have ever watched, not the worst. If you have time to kill, you might even like it.",1391731200,,174,3.5789473684210527
2805581,3,B000OY8NII,"There were some great plots, but the characters were all silly caricatures that made it seem like a sitcom at times.",1391731200,,116,4.571428571428571

2805584,5,B000OY8NII,This is indeed science fiction that is why I love it.  The more realistic part is the personal drama that has been incorporated around  the unrealistic but interesting science.  It could happen but probably won't realm.,1391644800,,219,5.027777777777778

2805586,2,B000OY8NII,Great ideas but not executed particularly well.  Couldn't get through the first episode.  None of the actors provided a much needed spark to hook me.,1391472000,,149,4.92
2805587,5,B000OY8NII,Funny Interesting Intelligent Original Not just another rehashed Friends or Seinfield.  Has a continuing plot. Good acting with interesting characters.,1391472000,,151,6.55
2805588,4,B000OY8NII,"The series is fun and entertaining.
I only give 4 stars because I can see that there is only so much that can be done with this format.
So far, its doing well building characters and giving different scenarios.
Entertaining for 45 min.",1391385600,,235,4.488372093023256

2805592,5,B000OY8NII,"I did not watch this show during the course of its run, didn't even know about it.  However, the actors really mesh well together and who wouldn't want to live in Eureka.  Some of the stars are underrated, and they made it believable as best you can for a show that combines the nostalgic past and the future as commonplace.  Great entertainment!!!!!",1391299200,,350,4.612903225806452
2805593,5,B000OY8NII,"My father was born in 1905, imagine the changes he saw in his 93 years of life.  There had been much progress by the time I came along, but changes are coming along at an ever faster rate.  Eureka tries to give us a taste of what is coming in the future.
The show is optimistic, the characters are positive and we are always treated with a pleasant mix of human interaction and the solving of a potentially catastrophic scientific dilemma. I wish the show could have gone on forever.",1391299200,,483,4.355555555555555
2805594,5,B000OY8NII,"My family enjoyed this show so much and we were so sad when they ended it. Wow! The writers for yjis show had some kind of imgination!

2805596,5,B000OY8NII,"I love how well they show that there are different kinds of intelligence.  Our sheriff, Jack Carter, is not the brainiac that the rest of Eureka's residents are. More often than not however, it's Jack's common sense and ""people smarts,"" being a genius at understanding human behavior and motivations, that save the day.",1391126400,,319,5.018867924528302

2805598,5,B000OY8NII,This is a sci-fi type movie but is very entertaining with good actors. I missed it when it played on tv. Now I get to watch all 5 seasons on my laptop through Prime. I've watched 7 episodes and have enjoyed them all.,1391040000,,216,4.046511627906977

2805607,5,B000OY8NII,I rate it very high.  you get caught up in the characters very quickly.  Colin Ferguson is awesome.  I love this series!!,1390867200,,121,4.409090909090909
2805608,5,B000OY8NII,Great for Sci Fi and conspiracy theorists.  Dramatic and humorous at the same time.  Follow future science as it may eventually become.  (Joke),1390867200,,143,5.130434782608695

2805614,5,B000OY8NII,I faithfully watched all 5 seasons of Eureka (even the one that was interrupted by the writer's strike) and loved it.  It was fun to go back and watch the first show and see how the characters have grown and changed.  Fargo looks like he's in high school and I had forgotten how gung-ho Duputy Lupo was...fun show.,1390176000,,314,4.396551724137931

2805618,5,B000OY8NII,"Eureka is a fun place to visit and allow your mind to explore the impossible,
the possible and the completely ridiculous. It's also fun to watch the dumbest smart person( Carter)
show up the whiz kids. They may ""save"" the planet but nine times from ten it starts with his idea.
Besides you realize that all us nerdy kids were right, science is fun.",1389830400,,348,4.453125

You really have to watch the first episode to get the background before it starts to make sense.  I never caught it while it was airing on Syfy but have been watching it on Amazon.

Every show seems to have a bunch of Superwomen scattered about beating-up grown capable men... well, the men on all of these shows are sissy men stereotypes from some other dimension.

2805640,3,B000OY8NII,"Loved the first episode of this but after watching 2 more episodes, I just couldn't get into it.  Not a huge sci fi fan so maybe that's it but it was just confusing to me as to what was actually happening and who everyone was.  Thought the acting was good though, just the story line left me wondering too much to hold my interest through more.  Could be just me.",1389225600,,363,4.1571428571428575

2805642,5,B000OY8NII,"Great premise for a series.  The plots are defined, characters are building strength as series progresses.  Lot of action and intrigue without the gore and violence of some of the other series.  Humor also.  Love the bantering between the teen and her father, the budding romance between the sheriff and the mayor, and the mystery behind the bed & breakfast hostess.  It is all so intriging and has unique government projects in the background........REALLY DELIGHTFUL,",1389139200,,469,5.2
2805643,5,B000OY8NII,"Eureka is a great show -- and Comcast put an end to it too early!  The premise, the characters -- they're all so fun and engaging!

2805646,5,B000OY8NII,"We absolutely love this show in our house - so much that we're watching it a second time! All the characters are wonderful; so dynamic that you can go from disliking a character to completely loving him/her in the same episode. In fact,the only main character that I can think of who stays completely likable throughout the whole first season is Sheriff Carter... Fargo is a favorite around here, as is Nathan Stark.
Yes, the episodes are formulaic in the sense that a major catastrophe is about to happen in Eureka and it's up to Sheriff Carter, Deputy Jo, Henry, and various others of the brainiacs at GD to solve it before the town blows up, is wiped off the map by a storm, disappears in a wormhole, or suffers an epidemic... but watch all the way through the seasons, and you'll find several long-standing story lines that began in season 1 continue to develop and resolve in a rather sophisticated fashion.
Eureka is a little similar to Warehouse 13, Roswell, and Fringe (some of Warehouse's actors even have parts in Eureka throughout its run), but, in my opinion, it far outshines them all in character development, special effects, plot, and just about every other area.",1389139200,,1179,4.728155339805825
2805647,5,B000OY8NII,I have watched this series several times. I love the town and the characters in the town. It is a bit goofy but I love the goofiness and I love how this series evolved over the 5 seasons. It's one of my top 10 favorite syfy shows.,1389139200,,230,3.9148936170212765

2805649,5,B000OY8NII,i got into this show long after it had been off the air. i probably would not of gotten into but they had some of the characters from this show in warehouse 13. being there all in the same universe i had to check it out. especially after i found out the warehouse gang goes to eureka becuase of an artifact.thats not in this season though its one of the later seasons.i must say me being someone who is not an intellectual i was always afraid i wouldnt understand the show. the first episode was a bit difficult to understand at first ill admit. thankfuly they did not make the show so as only people with iq's could understand it. they made it great for families. it has funny situations and weird things happening. the characters are great and the story lines are great.,1389052800,,772,4.368055555555555

2805653,2,B000OY8NII,Never having watched Eureka on TV I bought it because a friend of mine recommend it. She did warn me that in season 2 or 3 some of the episodes got hokey. I only bought season one and have to wonder if she meant to say that in season 2 or 3 some of the episodes got hokeier. I've seen worse (Farscape comes to mind) but I couldn't even finish watching the last couple episodes of season one because it was the same kind of stupid as the prior ones.,1388880000,,448,3.988888888888889
2805654,5,B000OY8NII,I love this show. Too funny about a sheriff that gets things to happen in the funniest way or i should say the sciencist projects that get out of control.,1388793600,,154,4.166666666666667
2805655,5,B000OY8NII,"Great show and you don't have to be a nerd (like me!) to enjoy it. The show went off the rails a bit by season 4, but i highly recommend seasons 1-3 for anyone who enjoys comedy, drama, suspense and sci-fi",1388793600,,205,4.024390243902439

2805657,5,B000OY8NII,"This show has drama, humor, and huge doses of sci-fi goodness. The show also manages to make science seem quite fun, and of course, absolutely dangerous.

2805666,5,B000OY8NII,"Eureka is one of my favorite shows, and season 1 is especially entertaining as it introduces us to the cast of off-beat characters.  Such a creative show.",1388361600,,154,4.703703703703703
2805667,3,B000OY8NII,"After watching several episodes of Eureka I gave up. Its a bit like slap-stick science fiction. None of the characters are very interesting. Colin Ferguson is the towns sheriff: the dumbest guy in town but always saves the day with his down home charm. Salli Richardson-Whitfield, in charge of company security, also falls for Colin Fergusons good ole boy charm. The towns deputy is the stunning Erica Cerra, but she is typecast as a gun tooting kick butt babe.

 Little drama here. We know how each episode will end.",1388275200,,517,4.797752808988764
2805668,5,B000OY8NII,It's Avery good show. Great acting. Good plots. Always keeps you wondering what's going to happen next. Sheriff carter is a hoot,1388188800,,128,4.863636363636363

2805670,5,B000OY8NII,A great family series that you do not have to worry about your children watching. Has fun with the smartest people being out witted by a common person.,1388188800,,151,4.428571428571429
2805671,5,B000OY8NII,I have watched all seasons of Eureka twice and now on my third run.  Characters are all interesting and well developed.  Plot twists keep the audience on its toes.,1388102400,,163,4.586206896551724
2805672,5,B000OY8NII,My son and I loved this show. We enjoyed the characters and the various circumstances they find themselves in. Always something unusual happening.,1388102400,,146,5.391304347826087
2805673,3,B000OY8NII,every ep. after the 1st is a dramatic drop off .The town and story was big enough to support so many more characters but they seem to only focus on so few.,1388102400,,155,3.875
2805674,5,B000OY8NII,I fell in love with this series with the pilot episode and that lasted throughout the finale.  I was so disappointed when it was cancelled.  The series was smart and funny not to mention appropriate for all ages.,1388016000,,212,4.552631578947368
2805675,4,B000OY8NII,"I just stumbled across this as I was picking out some selections to store. I was curious and clicked on the pilot episode just to see what it was. I was hooked right from the start. I'm not sure why, but I think it had something to do with the lead character and the introduction of several other major characters as the show progressed. I like a good mystery with a little comic relief thrown in and this show definitely has that, plus a good helping of sci-fi to round it out. As you may well have figured out, I'm trying real hard not to give away any plot lines that would ruin anyone's desire to view this very well done series. It contains some very good writing, well developed characters and a very good supply of special effects that should interest an entire family. So go ahead, give it a shot. I really do think you'll find it quite compelling, or at least very entertaining!",1387929600,,887,4.349397590361446
2805676,5,B000OY8NII,this series has funny moments as well as serious ideas to ponder.  I enjoy the idea that in the final series it all ties into the very first one.  I think everyone would enjoy this series.,1387670400,,188,4.194444444444445
2805677,5,B000OY8NII,"I've sat through and enjoyed this entire series twice over the last two years. Aside from Zoe Carter's annoying character in the earlier seasons (she gets less annoying as the angst wears out, of course), this show is filled with well cast, endearing characters. Overall, the show is light and fun, charming and campy. It's littered with enough goody gadgetry and warped use of physics and biology to qualify for sci-fi, but light-hearted enough to humble the show and ensure the viewer isn't expecting hard sci-fi in the process. If you're looking for that, hit the books, most television programming isn't serving that up. The special effects are a bit better than most other SyFy productions, but that's really not saying much. While I really loved this show, the network did fans and the actors a great disservice by splitting up the later seasons and never giving the show a proper finale. This happens all the time due to ratings, but it's really unfortunate when it happens to a show you've grown to love and want to wish a fond farewell.",1387670400,,1045,4.779005524861878
2805678,5,B000OY8NII,"I was surprised that I got to watch this show for free because of my Prime membership.  I love the theme of the show and all the acting!. There are so many things that can just blow your mind:  you are driving past another car with yourself in, as if you were looking into a mirror; a preteen who can solve quantum physics and connect with the origin of the universe....  I wish I could understand everything in that about science.",1387497600,,431,4.296296296296297
2805679,4,B000OY8NII,"Was checking out my TV and wanted to determine if a problem was with the cable or the set.  Went to an internet site to check and put Eureka on as a lark.  The short story is that the TV is fine but I had to keep watching the pilot for this series.  In the last few days I've watched almost all of the first season and absolutely love it.  The characters are done really well and the lead has got that smart-ass, witty, funny, hapless way about him that reminds me of the lead character in Firefly.  If you liked Firefly (I simply can't understand why it was cancelled) you'll really like this series.",1387497600,,601,4.191304347826087

2805682,3,B000OY8NII,"I love the idea of a town like Eureka, but the dark undertones of the series truly bother me. If only they would do another series that takes the characters into a different time that is completely positive. The acting and writing in the series are very good. The production values are better than many series I've watched.",1387152000,,323,4.586206896551724
2805683,4,B000OY8NII,"The show is interesting, sometimes a little too outlandish.  It feels like the science is a bunch of technical sounding terms all mashed together.  As long as you don't know much about the subject matter the stories are entertaining.  The one element I find a bit disturbing is the shows morality or lack thereof.  Sex is casual and marriage is an afterthought.",1387152000,,361,4.774193548387097

2805717,5,B000OY8NII,It continues to surprise you in each episode. It centers around inventions that one would like to see developed in our lifetime.,1383091200,,128,4.863636363636363
2805718,4,B000OY8NII,"Eureka is  sort of a Sci-Fi dramedy.  The characters are believable amd stories are somewhat engaging, but there's a lite, borderline comedy feel to it.  Not a life-changing show, but enjoyable nonetheless.",1382745600,,206,5.375
2805719,5,B000OY8NII,"What a great series.  Colin Ferguson is absolutely great ... well, they all are.  What a great idea for a series and it will keep you laughing and anticipating the and looking forward to the next episode.",1382659200,,204,4.486486486486487

2805721,5,B000OY8NII,This is a very interesting premise and I am quite enjoying watching the whole series starting from the Pilot.  Love all the quirky people and the poor ordinary sheriff who is still able to solve problems with his mediocre IQ.  Fun show.,1382400000,,236,4.595238095238095
2805722,5,B000OY8NII,Unique show concept that makes for endless and enjoyable plots.  Fairly family oriented (does have to sexual undertones/overtones) and language is mild.  My wife and I enjoy it and are pleased to have several seasons to look forward to.,1382400000,,236,5.0256410256410255

2805724,5,B000OY8NII,"The whole show is just the best.  Love the character development and the surprise plot twists.  It's great to see the supposedly ""every day sheriff"" keep his cool and help solve the problems when a multitude of brainiacs cannot.  He connects the dots.  Right now we could use his common sense in Congress (either house)!

Oh, and did I mention---NO COMMERCIALS!",1381968000,,361,4.852459016393443
2805725,4,B000OY8NII,"This is a SyFy ( really liked when they were SciFi) goodie. A very interesting concept of a town for America's most Brainac science type nerds. There are always adventures and wierd things happening in this small town. Mostly the plot centers on the science projects and inventions getting lose on the good people of Eureka ( and possibly the world), and the not so Brainac/ non nerd local sheriff solving the case and saving all. I know, not so brillant a plot, but enjoyable and decent FX ( for a non premium channel). Try it, you may like it.",1381881600,,545,4.46

2805730,3,B000OY8NII,"Nerdy sci-fi comedy/drama set in present-day USA, with decent visual effects. Witness the trials and tribulations of an ex-US marshal turned town Sheriff in the weird town of Eurika, home to the fictional Global Dynamics corporation, which researches lots of weird tech. Lots of fiddling with time-travel, mind-control, and side-effects of mysterious artifacts.

Far more shallow than Babylon 5 or Battlestar Galactica, or even DS9 in terms of story arc, bit enjoyable nonetheless. In later seasons it joins up with Warehouse 13, in the same universe.",1381708800,,551,5.406976744186046

When I finished the last episode of season 5, I was sad because I knew that there would be no more.  Don't understand exactly why this show didn't go on for a few more seasons.

But the ""non-genius"" sherrif solves the quirky mysteries and saves the day, or world. Uses real scientific theories to build fun, though somewhat outrageous, story lines. Characters are awesome. And who can't enjoy a show with the ""science guy"" playing a whacky veterinarian. Super IQ dogs, town full of geniuses hidden from the world. So cool.

2805792,4,B000OY8NII,I am undecided about this show. I will probably watch more episodes before I make up my mind. This first one was wild but I am not sure how it can continue at that pace without becoming too ridiculous. I like the main idea of a town like Eureka because I am a geek myself. Will just have to watch some more.,1377907200,,307,3.967741935483871

2805799,4,B000OY8NII,"Not really sure why I like this show, there are so many continuity errors, some of the science stuff could have been prevented by paying a college physics major $7/hr to look over the scripts... same thing for other obviously wrong things that happen during the show... but for some reason I am now watching season three and fully expect to watch seasons four and five.

I started watching this show because a friend told me it was the best show on tv (when it got cancelled) and I just added it on to my list of things to eventually get around to watching.

Even if you pretend that the science is real, the non linear story line and random time changes make it hard to believe. (The show might jump 6 months between the beginning of an episode and the end, or it might only be an hour or two, but the next episode is several months later.

It would have been much better if it had a single plot that carried through from beginning to end, like warehouse 13 a related, but much better produced show.",1377561600,2,1000,4.308510638297872

2805803,5,B000OY8NII,Great actors and plots. Special effects great. Nice distraction from the real world. Since I grew up in Eureka California I might not be as impartial as most reviewers.,1377388800,,168,4.827586206896552

2805806,5,B000OY8NII,I had started watching Eureka in the latter seasons.  So it was fun to go back an see the early epsiodes.  If you love a mix of a warm family story and sci-fi this is a lot of fun.,1377216000,,180,3.58974358974359

The characters are believable and easy to become ones you will care about. Watching the series in order helps follow the interaction of the players and become more involved in the program. Try it, you'll like it.",1376956800,,368,4.765625
2805810,5,B000OY8NII,"With so many writerless tv shows out there why such a cleverly written show ended is beyond me. Watch season 1 and you will have no choice but to get 2,3,4, and 5.

2805811,5,B000OY8NII,I started following Eureka during the 4th Season.  It was great but I often wondered about the time line differences that had occurred during the previous Seasons.  It was great when I got Amazon with free streaming.  I was able to go back to the beginning and see how everything came together.,1376870400,,294,4.615384615384615

2805818,4,B000OY8NII,"It's a very funny show, it probably needed a slightly larger budget to realize it's full potential. I say that because the regular cast appears to be fairly small and consequently the same couple of people generally solve most of the problems in the show. Give it a chance, it is a cool concept and it definitely grows on you.",1376524800,,326,4.45

2805824,5,B000OY8NII,"I miss shows like this. The sherif /dad isn't some bumbling fool who is constantly saved by his over achieving friends/family. Instead, he's a stand up role model, dealing with teen angst and ""real"" life. Good hearted humor and well written show. Actors are great and the plots always have a twist.

2805828,5,B000OY8NII,"I give a lot of series good ratings because they have 15 minutes to intrigue me or I don't watch anymore!  This one had me going from the first few minutes and now I'm hooked!  I rarely get sick, but when I do, I find a good series and enjoy it while getting better.  Now that I'm better I have to find time to watch this!

2805830,5,B000OY8NII,"One of the (scifi) things that make this so original is that it's not set in the future, it's not about time travel (for the most part), and it's not about space (for the most part).It's about how the inventions of the worlds greatest minds can either go wrong be misused and how the main character has to deal with it.

The comedy is hysterical, especially concerning the main character, and usually very fresh ideas.",1375920000,,418,4.573333333333333

I would recommend watching Carter, Alison, Stark, Henry, Zoe, Jo, Fargo and the rest of the characters in this scientific reality.  It's amazing all the inventions they come up with or try and fix before something drastic happens.
I truly recommend watching.  This is my second time around watching this season and I just can't get enough.",1375660800,,480,4.471264367816092

2805839,5,B000OY8NII,Too much TV is mindless trash.  I enjoy this one a great deal.  Especially the adolescent rebellion from the sheriff's daughter was entertaining and so typical of teens.,1375574400,,169,5.0
2805840,5,B000OY8NII,"I hated to see the end of this show. Loved it and Colin Ferguson, what a hottie. Too bad there really isn't such a place as Eureka, or maybe there is and we don't know it.",1375574400,,171,3.7777777777777777

2805845,4,B000OY8NII,This series is far fetched but also just entertaining. If you look at the technology on the show even to today it is off but I think this show is just made to enjoy.,1375574400,,165,3.8823529411764706
2805846,5,B000OY8NII,"I watched a couple of episodes on TV but since I came into the middle of the series, I didn't get all of the nuances. On Prime, I watched the entire series starting with the first show - very nice! Loved the ending.",1375488000,,215,4.023255813953488

2805849,4,B000OY8NII,The first three episodes had me hooked. The story lines are unpredictable and they keep me guessing to how each episode will end. There is quirky humor in every episode. A couple of the episodes seemed slow getting to the point which is why I did not give 5 stars.,1375315200,,264,4.3
2805850,5,B000OY8NII,"This show is terrific! One epsiode could be all comedy, another is a murder mystery, the third could be a drama. Its great to see a show with such flexibility!

2805859,5,B000OY8NII,"I missed the original airing of this series, and I was looking through amazon prime videos and stumbled on this and decided to give it a try.  Boy was I surprised. I am used to the hype around certain television programs especially those with a science fiction leaning. But this was fun, funny, light, different, and it never strayed too far from what it was meant to be, entertainment.  Throw plausibility out the window and enjoy. The character of the sheriff, played by Colin Ferguson, holds this series together.  Just enough action, just enough drama, and tons of fun. All of this in a one hour episode, just the way I like it. Most plot points are resolved in one or two episodes. This show never takes itself too seriously.  All of the reasons above are why I gave it 5 stars.",1375056000,,783,4.492957746478873

Then the ideas start to roll, taking theory and making actuality, borders on ""how could that possibly be"" but putting disbelief on hold presents a thorughly enjoyable story.

Good characters and development along with the sci fy twist. Good production value and to wrap it up had some very interesting plot lines. That's the way it was for 3 of its 5 seasons. First three seasons a really good watch.,1374969600,,400,4.418918918918919

2805875,3,B000OY8NII,"I loved the Eureka series on TV, and just bought all seasons from Amazon which were delivered promptly.  My only complaint is that the shows are SUBTITLED (called SDH, Subtitled for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing) not closed-captioned (that you can turn on and off with your TV's CC button).  I use CC often since I sometimes have trouble hearing the dialog, but there is no closed-captioning on the DVDs.  Instead they have an option to see SUBTITLED versions of the shows, which means that ALL of the dialog is shown in large white characters ALL THROUGHOUT THE SHOW. I find these subtitles annoying and distracting.

This is apparently what Universal Studios, now owned by Comcast, does. They don't seem to realize closed captioning and subtitles are different things used for different reasons.",1374624000,,796,4.917910447761194

The show is a great escape, like a little staycation, but you don't have to check your intelligence at the door either. It is engaging and fun too!

I takes some patience to get the whole picture -at least the first episode.  Once you get your bearing the show is quite good.  The imagination that went into this show is amazing.  Pens that are transducer, responders-whatever that means and other works of imaginative genius keeps this show appealing.  You never know what work of imagination you will see next.  If you don't care for imaginative shows this would not appeal to you.  I personally this it is a real hoot.

2805939,4,B000OY8NII,"In Eureka Season 1, Episode 9, we are introduced to Saul Rubinek, the brain behind Warehouse 13, a later series which is successful now on SyFy channel.  Both series explore 'science' effects of articles which can destroy people or the world. The main popular science questions are explored with humor, en route.

'Eureka' is premised on a town full of science geeks whose experiments and creations, often go wrong.  Each episode takes you through something that goes wrong, and how it gets righted, all within the hour.  The longterm plot is also canned:  some evil nefarious outside group, related to some corporate entity or the Government, is out to remove and use, stuff created within Eureka.

However, within Eureka, another corporate entity houses the experiments and creations, and everyone within Eureka is directly or indirectly dependent on that entity.  It is run by kind persons.  So the series offers a dual-sided perspective of corporate headship, not merely the stereotypical Big Evil Corporation lie so many have come to love.

Eureka's cast chemistry, however, doesn't synergize until well past the 2nd season.  Maybe that slowness is a director decision, using the initial awkwardness to create tension?  For until well into Season 2, the actors seem to just speak lines and move per blocking directives.  As if ordered to behave, woodenly.

The characters are human enough, and the acting is good.  Script is lackadasical, until well after the 2nd season begins, so one is tempted to quit watching.  Don't quit.

Canned nature of the episodes is also detrimental, wash rinse repeat.  So you already know how each episode will turn out.  Even so, the plots are intertwined, and the scripting gets better with each episode.  So eventually, both the characters and the plots, grow on you.  Series is worth re-watching, worth buying.",1372464000,,1850,5.1033333333333335

2805962,4,B000OY8NII,Has an everyman sheriff who every week has to solve problems the ultra scientific community of Eureka gets into. The only problem is some characters fill too many roles.,1371945600,,169,4.862068965517241
2805963,4,B000OY8NII,"I don't watch tv so had not even heard of this show, but have found it very clever and entertaining.  It combines a lot of aspects such as sci/fi, humor, drama, mystery and sentiment.  There is even the hint or promise of romance, but I have only watched six episodes.  I only gave four stars simply because I am not too aware of what else is out there, but I do like this show a lot.",1371945600,,384,4.026315789473684
2805964,5,B000OY8NII,Fun show every week.  How can you not like the 'Fargonator' and 'Give me your clothes!'  Great characters and fun stories.,1371945600,,122,4.761904761904762

2805966,5,B000OY8NII,"I thoroughly enjoyed this series . . . the storyline, the actors, and the interpersonal relationships were fabulous and amazing! Don't tell me why this show was cancelled . . . it was a mega-hit. There is definitely something wrong with NBC's management!

I don't get the lovable, goofy but competent sheriff thing -- I felt it overdone.  Columbo comes to mind for some reason.  I like the plots and again the characters and the acting is good.  Worth watching.",1371945600,,366,4.388059701492537
2805970,5,B000OY8NII,"EUREKA was very refreshing series.  It had the comedy of The Andy Griffith Show, set in a small town like Mayberry, with all of the quirkiness of My Favorite Martian, romance and power struggles rivaling any daytime soap or prime time drama and it still gave me my much needed doses of action and SciFi; if you listened carefully, you could actually learn something.

For me, all of those elements made it a unique and unbeatable amalgamation.  My TV time got a little smaller when the series was cancelled.",1371945600,,507,4.674157303370786
2805971,5,B000OY8NII,"One of the more refreshing shows that I have seen in a while.  The characters of the show are quite quirky but you grow to love the character from the ""normal"" sheriff in town to the super geniuses of the high IQ place of Eureka.  Good writing and good humor makes this one of the more up-beat show where the average sheriff rescues the town from it's own geniuses.",1371945600,,365,4.27536231884058
2805972,5,B000OY8NII,"Its filled with Great characters. Towards the very end of the whole show we were a little afraid the writers weren't going to end the show well, but they nailed it. It couldn't have been more perfect.",1371859200,,200,4.4324324324324325

2805975,5,B000OY8NII,Thoroughly enjoying this series...missed it during it's initial release as we had gone without cable for about 5 years to help my daughter get moving instead of being a couch potato..lol.  The strategy worked and she prefers outside activities instead of inside.  Now I get to catch up on all the TV I missed those years and this is a series that I am thoroughly enjoying!,1371859200,,372,4.621212121212121
2805976,5,B000OY8NII,This is one of my favorites. Excellent cast. Well played. Strong technology.  Leaves you guessing from episode to episode.

2805980,5,B000OY8NII,"I was hooked from the very first episode. You become invested in ever character and you feel their love, pain, and triumph because they are constructed so very well. The last season broke my heart when i got to it.",1371686400,,214,4.375
2805981,4,B000OY8NII,"This is a story which could be possible. It ties in conspiracy theories, romance, science, unusual characters (who are also believable), and adventure. The stories are consistent and fun. I am hooked and am now watching ALL the seasons! Enjoying it and hoping it doesn't end.",1371686400,,275,5.0
2805982,5,B000OY8NII,"Ok contestants, you are going to re-do Northern Exposure in a SyFy genre, and eureka!  EUReKA is born.  It is unique with just enough quirkiness, and has a wonderful blend of humor to balance out the drama of whatever catastrophe is happening today.  I'm half-way through season 2 and am starting to wonder how long the writers can keep coming up with a new, solve-able catastrophe for each show.  But who really cares as long as they do?  The characters are engaging and the acting is good to great.  All really good SyFy shows have an underlying commentary on the human condition of some type and EUReKA does come up a little short in that department in a few episodes.  The commentary is not absent, just a little weak sometimes.  But that's my only real criticism at this point.  Still watching and still loving it.  EUREKA!  I found a new show to watch compulsively!",1371686400,,871,4.590909090909091

2805985,5,B000OY8NII,"This was a great show. Witty and imaginative. Funny without slapstick or offensive actions or dialog.
The cast was warm and easy to accept into our homes.  It's run was far too short. For which I blame Scy Fy which is less science fiction every season!",1371686400,,252,4.478260869565218
2805986,5,B000OY8NII,Loved it.  Quirky and fun.  Can't wait to catch up with the following seasons.  If you liked this show you will love Warehouse 13 too.,1371340800,,134,4.28
2805987,5,B000OY8NII,"I rarely watch SF movies these days, but I must say that I have watched all the episodes of Eureka Season 1 with great pleasure. I am now almost through Season 3 and I can't believe that a show this good ends with Season 5. What a shame.

It's a good, lively show with interesting, colorful characters and events that may blow your mind but which you get used to pretty easily for they occur in a very unusual town filled with top-notch scientists working on their next biggest breakthrough. It's when these breakthroughs get out of control that things get even more interesting (amusing or dramatic), but usually with a happy end to the main characters, including the town's sheriff, his deputy and his daughter, and a few other people that the show episodes revolve about.

Highly recommended, definitely worth the price of Amazon Prime for me.",1371340800,,846,4.70945945945946

Wish I would have supported it while it was on air, but it is nice to sit back and know you can watch all 5 seasons uninterrupted.  Give it a chance and I think you will like it. :)",1371254400,,352,4.0

It can be hard or is hard to follow the technology referred to but is very entertaining at the same time. It is almost subliminal education to a world a cut above normal every day life.",1371081600,,279,4.0
2805999,4,B000OY8NII,"Season 1 of Eureka was pretty good except for the fact that it bashes white Men at every opportunity. I don't know what drives writers other than bigotry and/or other prejudices yo do such things in their shows or movies, but it is definitely noticed. Are you under the impression that you are somehow making up for the 1950s? You can't. The only way to end injustice is to end it. You can not take turns and hope for a favorable outcome. The stories aside from the aforementioned showed imagination. I liked this Season in spite of the shortcomings of bashing white men at every opportunity. The Daughter disrespects her Dad and it's funny and OK. The subordinate bashes and somehow bests her superior at every turn, and it's ok. THe second in command in the entire complex undermines her superiors authority, and it's ok. All the White Men are stumble Bums, and it's OK. The affable Black character at the Garage is superior to everyone and yet the stumbling bumbling White guy always has to save even his bacon. IF you can overlook this tripe then the show is about as fun to watch as any other modern SciFi, Sitcom. ALL  shows are like this, every single one of them. I love sifi, but I like it when there is actual equality and not oneupmanship.",1371081600,,1250,4.530973451327434

Fun stuff for sure.",1371081600,,290,4.314814814814815

2806016,5,B000OY8NII,The thing about shows like Eureka is that eventually they get so busy trying to come up with new story ideas that top the last story arc in some way that they lose some or (depending on the series) a lot of the emotions the original concepts intended to evoke. The first season of Eureka holds tight to the sense of wonder an ordinary practical cop experiences when dumped into a town that must feel to him like the other side of the looking glass. At the same time the cop' practicality and down to earth realism causes Jack to feel a huge sense of frustration with the town's not always practical residents. Excellent viewing.,1371081600,,628,4.469565217391304

The show has a decent pilot that makes you interested, then it just gets better. It's a basic formula, new issue every week with underlying carried back stories. I won't go in detail since you can read whats the gist of it, but it's about a quirky genius-town where the protagonist (Jack Carter) is a sheriff and tries to hold everything together. In a town full if geniuses, Jack plays a related character to the viewer and goes through crazy situations each episode.

I love all types of shows, and while the acting may not be there with this show, there's just something addicting about and can't stop watching each show after the next. Definitely worth a watch.",1370390400,,879,4.598726114649682

This is definitely sci-fi, but in a unique setting.  It's quirky, and sees things from a different view point.  In other words, anything goes!  But it's not heavy-duty sci-fi, slogging through a plot.  It's an everyday 'sheriff' trying to do his job, (where at least half the town are geniuses), while dealing with his rebel daughter, stranger than life cases, and a futuristic house that doesn't always see things his way.",1370131200,,562,4.626262626262626

2806076,5,B000OY8NII,"We have just started watching this tv series via Amazon Prime.

There are some lengthy reviews that cover what this show is about in depth. So I will keep this review short.

Overall this is a very enjoyable show. My children (ages in range from 9 to 13) have enjoyed it. The story line is about a town that is tied to a business named Global Dynamics. (GD for short). GD is a lab like environment similar to other Government Labs. Engineers and scientists and other sciency type of people are encouraged to make great leaps in technology and inventions.

And with great leaps come great challenges and thus the show is built around these wierd situations that wouldn't normally occur. There are several people who are not as smart around this town, the sherrif being one of them. These people have to often solve these wierd situations. The talking house gets mad. The DNA of the sherrif's daughter gets changed so she ages faster than normal. An extra sun is developed. etc etc.

This is a great show. The love lines are very realistic in many ways. The interactions between the people in the town stay true from one season to the next. There is not this gratuitis show of sex to 'keep the excitement'. There is a genuine idea behind this that smart people are the ones that make the great advances in our world and that smart people are not lacking in common sense, not geeks, not nerds- but real people who are also smart.

We have enjoyed this show.
Enjoy.",1370044800,,1461,4.518939393939394

Two hours into Season One of EUREKA had me squinting in disbelief at the dimwitted implausibility of the plot...the fatuous dialogue...the psuedo-scientific mumbo-jumbo...the grating voice of Colin Ferguson...the rehearsal-like acting on the part of the show's flesh-and-blood mannequins -- in short, just about everything.

2806118,5,B000OY8NII,"US Marshall Jack Carter has a fear of flying, and is transporting a prisoner by car when he gets lost.  While he is distracted a dog wanders onto the road, and he has to swerve to miss it.  When he does so, he slides off of a wet Oregon road and is stuck.  A phone call later a tow truck appears, and he is taken to the nearby town of Eureka.  At first everything seems fine in this sleepy little town, but little by little things become increasingly unusual.  Finally, he gets involved with a search for a little boy.  His work brings him to the attention of the local town leadership, and he is recruited to be the town's new sheriff.  When this happens he soon learns that Eureka is no ordinary town.  It is a town populated by ultra-brilliant scientists and their families.  The scientists work at a nearby secret research facility - Global Dynamics.  It is supported by government and military funding, and researchers there investigate every field of science.  Jack Carter doesn't know what he's getting into.

As time goes along we are introduced to a colorful, eccentric cast of characters.  These include the lab director, the local mechanic (who also does physics), the head of Global Dynamic security and her autistic son, the company psychiatrist, the chef of the local restaurant, the deputy, the corporate gopher ""Fargo"", and on and on.

The show is funny, engaging, interesting, and a combination of completely believable and unbelievable.  Gradually Sheriff Carter gets used to the town, and they to him, more or less.  And though he's pretty much a regular guy, he and the braniacs of Eureka are able to find ways to work together.

I am SO glad that I found this series.  I'm also glad that there are more seasons to watch.

The character development and diversity of story lines and characters make Eureka a fun experience.

I also VERY much appreciate the fact that this show is watchable.  There is very little foul language, and so far at least there is nothing in it that makes me hesitate watching this with my 13-year old daughter.

I look forward to seasons 2-5.

2806131,5,B000OY8NII,This is a very creatively written show about an average man who becomes the sheriff of a town filled with scientists and all the chaos that erupts when their inventions go haywire.

I soon found out that Xfinty had what they call sreampix for $5.oo a month and the first 3yrs were on it. I really enjoyed the first season and I finally bought it, along with several Jesse Stone DVDs. Considering that Eureka and some of the Jesse Stone's came from at least 3 places plus amazon, I still got all of them in a week.

2806137,5,B000OY8NII,"What I particularly like about this show is that the people and the events are believable, even though they are clearly outside of reality as we know it.  It is futuristic and yet very much in the present.  The most virtuous aspect of this series is that I can be sure to be spared foul language, unnecessary sex, and brutal violence.  The viewer always knows that the contentious situation will be resolved, that humor will be laced throughout, and that romance and intrigue will be handled gracefully.  Thank you to the writers for an enjoyable fantasy!",1352160000,,555,4.75
2806138,4,B000OY8NII,"Before a series, even a really good one like this, get funding, the first season always has some limitations; character development, special effects (altho' not such an issue in this case), scripts and so on.
That being said, I think this is a great, innovative and fun series; the basic concept is actually pretty neat (ever wonder what happens to the really bright people in this country or why the DoD pays $500 for a hammer?) and almost believable.
Well worth a watch!  I plan on buying the entire set at some point...",1350864000,2,522,4.612903225806452
2806139,5,B000OY8NII,"Eureka season 1 was not the first season of this series  I bought. After seeing the show on television, I bought the first season I ran across which was season 4.0. I enjoyed it so much that I decided to go back to the first episodes and see how it all began. The characters are likable and the plots are unique. The writers definitely stepped outside of the box.",1350259200,,363,4.260869565217392
2806140,3,B000OY8NII,"You need to view this one again in order to get a complete understanding of the series finale.  If you missed the series opener this is a must.  However, we watched this and are going to have to watch this multiple times in order to understand all that is being said.  If you have a hearing impairment there are no subtitles available to asist you.  You have to turn the volume way up and ""try"" to run it back to hear what you missed.  We will probably not get anything else on Amazon Video.  This also happened on a couple of movies we purchased that came with a free digital viewing in a combo-pac.",1347148800,,600,4.219298245614035

2806143,5,B000OY8NII,I found this series to be enjoyable and refreshingly original.  The series seems to delight in taking alternative views of regular science fiction themes.  The series is done with a refreshing sense of humor.,1345507200,,208,5.088235294117647
2806144,5,B000OY8NII,"Character- this show is all about it. If you ever wished that the SyFy channel would take the best elements of all those wonderfully cheesy movies that they produce, whip them together in a stew, and see what happens, then ""Eureka"" is the answer to your prayers. Each character was perfectly cast, headlined by the wonderful Sheriff Carter, who has everything that one could hope for in a leading role (at least on SyFy). He is that goofy, funny, honest, reliable, downright likable guy who embodies all the best parts of the classic ""SyFy Sheriff"", while channeling a bit of Bruce Campbell's spirit. Right on!

As far as the setting of this show goes, it's hard not to love the town of Eureka, which seems like it was inspired by ""BioShock"" and ""Atlas Shrugged""... but with a lot more love and fun. The new scientific mess that Sheriff Carter seems to find himself trying to resolve each week is always enjoyable. The conflicts that arise are a perfect blend between being comfortable/familiar (to other conflicts in the series) and fresh enough to remain interesting and unique. Additionally, the show does a great job of developing a long term plot, by sprinkling clues throughout the episodes over the course of the season.

As you can see, this is an ""Amazon Verified Purchase""... on DVD. ""Are they still making those?"" I asked myself, when I saw that it was the ONLY purchase option. The Blu-ray format has been around for over seven years now, and I see no reason why manufacturers would expect me to buy an antiquated, vastly inferior format (DVD)... unless if they force me to. Would they ask me to buy it on VHS, if it was cheaper for them to manufacture? For some strange reason, this marvelous show is not available for purchase on Blu-ray. There is a HUGE difference in visual quality between these DVDs and when I watch the show on Netflix, which streams in HD. Needless to say, it looks much, much better in the HD format, and the (presumably low budget) CG effects hold up surprisingly well under such high detail. I sincerely hope that SyFy and its parent company will decide to offer their great shows in as many formats as possible- including Blu-ray. But I enjoy this show so much, it would not be fair to knock its five star rating for the limitations of the DVD format.",1345334400,,2291,4.640394088669951
2806145,3,B000OY8NII,"Eureka is an interesting show about a guy who gets a job in a place where everyone seems to be a genius. While trying to get adjusted, make amends with his daughter, and getting to know the town, he's also having to deal with some extremely crazy and peculiar circumstances. The story line isn't to bad and it's got a decent feel of something different, minus the fact that the main character is in law enforcement like 90% of all the tv shows out there right now. The biggest place I feel this series falls short on is the acting and it's failed attempts at humor, or making any sense at all at times. I'm not saying stay away from this series, but if I were you, I'd watch the first episode or two before deciding if you want to put time or money into it.",1343865600,,757,4.191780821917808
2806146,2,B000OY8NII,"Not quirky enough, not funny enough, not dark enough...basically, not ""anything"" enough to sit through. TV is full of examples of that this series tried to copy.

Unfortunately for those of us who said ""I'll give it a try,"" we remain scratching our heads about how this made it past a pitch meeting in the post-cocaine Hollywood era. I love shows that aren't traditionally popular. This ain't one of those.",1340064000,3,406,4.8

2806148,5,B000OY8NII,"Eureka is one of my favorite shows of all time. LOVE LOVE LOVE the characters and I'm soooo sad to know this is their last season. Stupid Viacom pulling b/c it costs too much. Like they don't have the money. Besides, if you ask ANY of the fans, they wouldn't mind some more toned down episodes in special effects and gadgets if we got to keep the town sheriff. Seriously.",1338768000,,371,4.314285714285714
2806149,5,B000OY8NII,Eureka was recommended to us by our son. We have finished the first two seasons and into the third.  There is a delightful mix of off-beat characters and situations that we find very entertaining.,1338076800,,196,4.764705882352941
2806150,5,B000OY8NII,Anything Eureka is fine with me. We have enjoyed the season and now we can re-watch it any time we want.,1337299200,,104,4.0
2806151,5,B000OY8NII,"What is it like being an average joe in a town full of the world's smartest people? Eureka attempts to answer that exact question.

Poor U.S. Marshall Jack is driving a suspect across several states (he hates flying) when a vision suddenly appears in front of his car causing him to swerve off of the road and hit a tree. The car needs extensive repair, meaning he is stuck in the unconventional town of Eureka. Nothing is every normal there, but he ends up solving a missing person case with his skills as a US Marshall. This earns him a promotion to town sheriff where he deals with the every day events in this wacky town.

Each episode is more bizarre than the last. I honestly say that in a good way. It keeps you wondering what could possibly pop up next. So far I've only watched the first 8 or 9 episodes, but each one is better than the last. It is clear there are so many possibilities to this series, and the fact that it has been on for so long tells me they're doing something right. I've thoroughly enjoyed every minute, and can't wait to get back to the hijinks Eureka and its residents have to offer.",1336348800,,1116,4.309523809523809
2806152,5,B000OY8NII,I love the season 1 DVD of Eureka! The episodes here are very good.  I LOVE the Pilot episode.  I laughed SOOO Hard! The characters are well written.  The acting is great by everyone.,1329868800,,183,4.323529411764706
2806153,5,B000OY8NII,Leave it to SyFy channel to cone up with some extremely good programming.  Eureka is tops.  Too bad it is ending after it's 5th sesson.  Enjoy the show!,1327276800,,152,4.357142857142857

2806155,1,B000OY8NII,"It's hard to believe all these great reviews.  This show tries way too hard to develop a Northern Exposure-like cast of quirky characters.  It also tries way too hard to convince you that everyone in town is a super-genius a la ""Real Genius"" with Val Kilmer.  However, the real trouble starts when the entire town comes together and starts finishing each others' sentences - solving impossibly complicated problems with a few minutes of facile, preposterous techno-babble.  It's enough to make me long for the plausibility of the worst episodes of Star Trek Voyager, if not a quick death.  I wonder how Hollywood executives thought that writing a show about geniuses and mind-bending science at an elementary school level of sophistication would be a good idea... oh yeah, all those great reviews.  Never mind.",1324598400,8,810,5.052631578947368
2806156,5,B000OY8NII,"I'm 56 years old, and grew up in a household that was very deeply involved in the local political scene. I worked for a campaign for the first time when I was twelve. Between then and now it certainly appears that what what passes for political discourse would have formally been considered unacceptable by either party. The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have been brutal and highly controversial. I other words,it's hard to avoid the sadness, nastiness and stress that has found its way into virtually every segment of society.

And then Eureka came along. For the mere cost of forty five minutes or so of suspension of disbelief, viewers can enter a world where kindness, fairness and humor prevail. This is made possible by the fine acting, writing and production values that this show has brought to the screen every week.

Like other successful ensemble shows, it is easy to imagine that the cast members truly enjoy working together, and that they have exceptionally good relationships with the shows creators and writers. During the 1st season, some spectacularly funny (and perhaps a tad inappropriate) podcasts were available to enjoy while watching the individual episodes. Not only was it enormous fun, it offered viewers real insight to the show's creation, filming it's pilot and what it was like once the program got the green light.

Collin Ferguson as Jack Carter does a wonderful job of being the straight man for almost every other character on the show. He strikes just the right chord of portraying a strong man, who isn't ashamed to be in situations where he finds himself in over his head. Eureka's producers managed a huge score in getting the brilliant Joe Morton to join the cast. I never imagined that he would stay with the show. Likewise having Salli Richardson Whitfield on the show as the beautiful but frequently conflicted Dr. Allison Blake was a first class piece of casting. Jordan Hinson has proven to be a real discovery. Although she didn't come to the show with a very long resume, she is clearly a gifted actress who I fully expect will have a career long after Eureka has left the airwaves. As Deputy Lupo, Erica Cerra is not only a feast for the eyes, but has had the opportunity to display a wide range of emotions, always with great skill. All of the cast members, regulars or visitors are uniformly superior.

Eureka is like a big bowl of your mother's best chicken soup. When the realities of the day are making you sick Eureka offers an infusion of good will, fantasy and humor, all prepared just the way you like it.",1323820800,2,2562,4.750561797752809
2806157,5,B000OY8NII,"Eureka is different. After Farscape and Stargate went off the air, I thought I'd never find a great scifi series. And then Syfy (then Scifi) picked up Eureka. What a refreshing show. It took the usual scifi/fantasy genre and made it fun and funny, not always serious and this series has no problems making fun of itself. It's completely irreverent and I love it. Word to the wise: Syfy has since canceled this series so the upcoming season (summer 2012) will be Eureka's last. The only good thing about this? Is that I can purchase the series on blu-ray when they get the complete series out.",1322870400,,592,4.59433962264151
2806158,5,B000OY8NII,awesome think every body should watch this series. it scientific and funny all at the same time. you'll get sucked in like i did,1317427200,,128,4.375
2806159,5,B000OY8NII,"I'm not a big fan of television and I remember a few years ago seeing a promo for this new series.  However, my cable company didn't carry the Sci-Fi channel and I had forgotten all about it until it I got my subscription to NetFlix.  While the show typically uses the same mechanical plot from week to week (something big is scheduled to happen but is interrupted by another experiment that only the Sheriff can figure out so in the end everything is o.k.), the mix of science, science fiction, and humor makes the show entertaining.  I've found myself researching the different theories presented on the television show out of sheer curiosity and it has sparked my interest in returning to school to finish up my Master's.

Colin Ferguson, hands down, is one of the funniest men on television today.  While ""Dr. Fargo"" lends a hand now and then, ""Jack Carter"" is the show's comic relief and the man that we can relate to.  There has been many times I have found myself laughing out loud while watching the show and that rarely happens with any other series.

It's a shame that the series will be cancelled after season 5, especially after being revitalized with a very great season 4, but all good things will eventually come to an end.  I would highly recommend this to any aspiring young scientist and/or science fiction fan looking for inspiration.",1316131200,2,1353,4.679324894514768

2806163,3,B000OY8NII,"I bought season 1 based on the gushing reviews on this site and recommendation from my mother-in-law.

I hope it gets better.  My wife and I are about 1/2 way through the first season right now and we don't see what's so great about this show.  Entertaining?  Barely...  Mildly diverting?  Sure...

The storylines aren't all that compelling.  The acting is, as the title of my review says, ""Meh!""  The sheriff's character is neutered and has basically no authority since the 'Global Dynamics' guys always override his crime investigations with, ""Sorry, this is a Sector 5 thing... classified.""  What's the point of having a sheriff?  If I was that guy, I'd walk off the job and flip off management while doing it...  As for the ""comedy"" aspect of the show... Not.  The banter that's supposed to be comedic is just flat and not funny. ""Whoa ho ho... that's a knee slapper...""  I guess if I want science and comedy together, I should stick with Big Bang Theory.

I'll keep giving this show a chance, but if season 1 doesn't get a whole lot better quick, I won't be wasting my $$$ on season 2.  Frankly I'm stunned at all the 5-star reviews on Amazon.  I guess others here have a relatively low threshold for what they consider good entertainment.",1313625600,4,1244,4.63302752293578

2806167,3,B000OY8NII,"I'm not a TV person. Except for an odd hour here and there or the occasional James Bond festival, I've missed pretty much everything on TV since about 1975. So, when my wife invited me to watch it on netflix, my response was ""Yes dear. Let me get something to read.""

So, I was very surprised at enjoying this, even a little. Lack of commercials did a lot for my mood. And, as a borderline nerd pride activist, so does the overall theme of people being friendly, having wide interests, and being smarter than me in every direction. Smart people are fun. (The truly smart people I mean, not the poseurs with one odd knack.)

Well, I keep reading while I watch it, but I do that with almost everything that doesn't have subtitles. It's good, though, as commodity entertainment goes, and shows that nerds aren't just the hygiene-challenged stereotype we've come to tolerate. I'll come back for more. The ""Andy of Mayberry"" vibe, with the single-father sheriff and whistled theme music, adds a retro kind of appeal that clashes pleasantly with the SF backdrop.

But it's still just TV.

Even though there is a difference between the genius of the scientists and the logic of the sheriff-everyone in Eureka is part of a family.  Besides the great characters in the show, something always happens in Eureka.  In one of the special features, one of the writing team mentions that each idea for an episode starts with ""real science"" and then gets ""Eurekasized"".  It goes from something that can be explained by science to something crazy.  All of these factors make ""Eureka"" one of the funniest shows to watch.  What makes this show really work is not the ""funny lines"" even though the writing is great, it is the characters that are funny.

Where else would you find the garage mechanic is an existential physicist, the town dog-catcher has hunted wild beasts from Africa to the Arctic, and the local shrink runs a bed-and-breakfast with emphasis on the ""bed"", if you get my drift.  Add a Deputy whom, except for the by-the-book fanaticism, is very little like Barney Fife (better looking for one thing, and way more competent) and an Opie who may be autistic but can do differential calculus (on sidewalks) and you have ""Eureka"".

We watch this together (son 12, daughter 16, wife 47, me 44) and only once or twice found an ""adult"" situation that we made our son close his eyes for (really not bad).

One of the best parts of the series is the time spent on strong character development, it did seem to get the series off to a slightly slow start but it was worth it as the show progressed. By the end of the first season, the characters are fully fleshed out and very ""real"".

2806202,4,B000OY8NII,"As reflected by author Arthur C. Clarke in the third of Clarke's Three Laws of Prediction, Eureka is a town of ""magic"" for the scientifically minded. With the same sociopathic aplomb of Harry Potter, it's a place where things and people explode - in fact, they're encouraged to. Characters frequently refer to the towns founding principle of ""pushing the boundaries"" of science, and the by-product of collateral damage that results. This doesn't make the job of its new Sherriff, Jack Carter, any easier. Carter, one of the ""normals"" (with a normal IQ), finds the town's blas&eacute; reactions to the various explosions, disintegrations and mad-science downright unsettling.

Don't look for real science here - it's all Buck Rogers and Star Trek variety. There's alot of talk about tachyons and theoretical equations, but it's all lighthearted so you don't need a PhD to appreciate.

Ferguson, who plays Carter, is a long overlooked actor, and his goofy, uncomfortable demeanor fits well with the character of a ""normal"" sheriff out of his depth. While the writing of Season 1 has yet to achieve the cohesion reflected in Series 2, and the story consequently meanders a bit looking for what works with audiences and what doesn't, it's still mostly on the mark, and great fun to watch. Originally having low expectations of the series, I'm now a fan, due in no small part to Ferguson's awkward yet convincing characterization.",1218153600,,1425,5.085470085470085
2806203,3,B000OY8NII,"I am thoroughly captivated by this show, having missed the first two seasons and catching up with them on these two DVD sets. Even before I saw season 3 Episode one in HD on cable the other night, I was struck by the softness of the picture, which could not be improved by my upconverting Playstation 3. Displaying the details during playback confirmed that the average bitrate to be about 4Mbit per second, which indicates a very aggressive compression rate. This was likely necessary to squeeze 4 epsidoes onto one DVD.

At 10Mbs, a single layer DVD will hold 60 minutes of video.  At 5Mbs, it holds about 120 minutes.  That only 4-42 minute episodes at a total of about 4Mbs will fit on one DVD tells you that they are not even using dual layer DVD's!

Considering you are paying about $30 for a relatively short season show, there is simply no excuse for cheaping out and being so stingy with DVD's, which are very inexpensive. There should be no more than two episodes per disc, with an average bitrate of 8-9Mb, not 4.

This quality is even more unnacceptible considering the look of the show is simply amazing, with impressive artistic design and first-rate special effects. Even the scenery is breathtaking. If they cannot offer this show in BLu-Ray, they need to make the only available format looks as pristine as possible. High bitrate DVD can looks simply amazing. If I want the show to look as soft and fuzzy as this, I'll record it onto VHS.

The story revolves around the Sheriff and his family.  The sheriff is one of the few people in Eureka without a genius IQ. The Sheriff is also the only one who can solve the interesting problems that plague this scientific community.

I find this an interesting concept.  I can see where focusing on only part of a problem makes it impossible to solve.  However, I think this series is going one step further.  I think it is a gracious way to say that our problems will be easier solved with the common man than by the inventions and brilliance of the Einsteins of the world.",1216080000,3,908,4.4156626506024095
2806205,4,B000OY8NII,"The first season of Eureka is funny, charming, and a little frustrating.
The show is funny and charming because of the delightfully quirky characters and their interactions, which are far more reasonable than one generally finds on this type of show.
The frustration comes with the introduction of major plot lines that are then just dropped, or barely dealt with, such as the information that one or more of the core characters may be acting against the interests of the community. The threat is introduced and then left by the wayside.
Another frustration comes from the teen-aged daughter who is interchangeable with every other annoying teen that you have ever seen on television.
That said, the other characters make sense within the universe that the writers have created, they have depth as people, their own agendas and a reason for being where they are and acting as they do (motivations that are missing from many television characters).

The cast have grown into their respective characters very well, and each brings something to the show, and the personal interactons between characters is becoming well developed as well.

It's sort of like a fine grain Styrofoam. The sliding around smudges the discs, and leaves tiny specks of material clinging to them.

The material is supposed to be environmentally friendly. That would be great if this were a disposable product, but who buys DVD sets and throws away the packaging?

And the premise, about a town of super-geniuses, has a tremendous amount of potential for some very interesting stories.

Others have commented on the terrific cast, so I won't repeat their praise again here. The first season seems to have been an opportunity for the writers to experiment with different premises. I don't think all the episodes premises work that well within the framework of the show. Although I'm happy to say that the show does get stronger towards the end.

If you didn't completely like the first season of Eureka (like me), then I strongly recommend giving the second season a chance.

2806255,5,B000OY8NII,"Eureka has everything going for it: fun story lines that are either inventive or clever re-tellings of familiar ones, smart dialogue that never takes itself too seriously for too long and does not fall into the trap of being too self-aware ; and actors who find just the right spot for their characters, pretty much from the get-go.

As a sci-fi show about a City of ber-nerds decades in advance on the rest of the planet, it is interesting enough, cleverly avoiding an uneasy comparison with very real science towns of the past, typically in the old Soviet Union. The characters of Eureka are so individualistic, quirky and likable that one is not too concerned about the questionable nature of this elitist environment which seems to have (limited) accountability only to the DoD. It even gets real-life dilemmas very real, as when Henry and Nathan argue over the goals of basic research and the Big Money or Big Guns compromises that make them possible. You don't see this articulated too often on television, and never as simply or as smartly as on Eureka.

The success of the show, though, is in its greatest part the success of its actors. Observe for instance the work done by Colin Ferguson, who probably channels the comedic timing of his early years with Second City into a Sheriff Carter who is the perfect Straight Man, serious throughout but regularly triggering good old fun along the way.

Observe also the work done by Ed Quinn (Nathan Stark) who grows gradually from an annoying suit (what new Sheriff Carter sees initially) to a more layered, interesting character as the season progresses. In Season Two, because of a modification of his situation, Stark will become even more complex, but Season One already shows the transformation in motion, explaining why Allison Blake, though separated/divorced from her husband, is still very close to him, much to Carter's chagrin. Of course, we see Stark evolving because Carter himself is forced to gradually see him in a more complex way. This is typically what you can expect from Eureka and what gives an otherwise expectable sci-fi fare its unusual zest.

The show knows how to be touching, as in the connection Carter has with his daughter. It is hilarious when Carter, even though he solves a lot of their problems, is gently treated as a lovable half-wit by the other residents of Eureka, or when Carter harasses Fargo, typically about his secret Buffy the Vampire Slayer infatuation. It is poignant when Henry has to face impossible choices and their consequences which will carry over into season two.

For a show that started as a project for an animated series, Eureka is remarkably human, without even giving the impression of trying too hard. With its good (and probably unexpected)good ratings, it will hopefully continue to evolve for many seasons. And with its underlying arcs (the Artifact, Beverly's role, Allison's son...) it has a built-in path to do just that.",1188691200,2,2943,4.913480885311872

2806275,5,B000OY8NII,"I happened to stumble upon this show last summer (2006) when SciFi ran a repeat of the pilot.  While I had seen a few of their promotion spots, I had no idea what to expect.

I could barely believe my eyes (or ears).  Here was a show that was interesting, well-acted, intelligently written and funny and yet a) had no gratuitous sex or violence, b) managed to be humorous without being lewd or crude, and c) unlike the vast majority of scifi, didn't take itself too seriously.

Thanks to my recently-acquired DVR, I was able to record and watch every episode of Season One, and, while there were one or two that weren't the greatest, overall I thought the first season was a huge success and was thrilled when I found out SciFi had chosen to pick the series up for a second season.

Since I hate commercials as much as anyone, I'm planning to break into my piggy bank very soon and order the set.

2806276,1,B000OY8NII,"I only watched Disc #1 and then quit. Too boring for me. I had to fast forward through most of it. Even listening to some of the commentary didn't help get me interested. The characters are just too bland or over-the-top for my liking.

Although I'm a Debrah Farentino fan, not even her hot body could keep me hooked on this quirky drivel. I could see myself watching this if there were only a few tv shows released on Dvd. Instead, I'll be watching ""The 4400"", Season 1, Disc #2. It's not fantastic, but it does interest and entertain me long enough to keep me watching. I also enjoy ""Stargate Atlantis"", ""Curb Your Enthusiasm"" and Season #2 of ""Weeds"". I hate ""Babylon 5"".

I also recently saw ""Sliders"" Season 1-Disc #1(first few episodes) and found them mostly painful to watch. I remember enjoying the later season's episodes better (many years ago), but was shocked at how bad the early ones look to me now. They just don't hold up well, over time (but I guess they knew that would happen).

""Eureka"" also shocked me. I wasn't expecting it to be so bland. With so many positive reviews, I'm obviously in the minority, but I still think you're all nuts for liking this so much.

2806278,2,B000OY8NII,"The acting, cinematography, costume, and set design are all conservative, more like The OC and CSI if not Days Of Our Lives than you'd expect from a supposedly creative cable show. The plot development is slow and dialogue often redundant enough that the show could be more engaging if each one hour episode was edited down to a half hour in post-production. The character development, in terms of both comedic quirks and emotional depth, is mimimal and generic. The acting is relatively stiff, with speech patterns leaning away from realistically conversational towards monologues projected at the audience. The way the dialogue is written seems to lend itself to this type of delivery though. The quirkyness and creativity I anticipated in this show based on a Northern Exposure comparison were not forthcoming. I'd consider the show worth watching if the episodes were edited down to half their length, but as it is they're carrying too much dead weight to hold my interest.

2806279,5,B000OY8NII,"As a fan of The X-Files, I immediately was drawn to EUReKA's ""there's something going on around here that isn't quite right"" atmosphere. The show isn't totally like The X-Files, as there's been no real alien activity...yet. But more than any other show, EUReKA is The X-Files spiritual offspring. The cast of characters is already quite large, and each of them are interesting in their own way.

The storylines are that of the fantastic, and since the show is built upon the fact that the town of EUReKA is made up entirely of brilliant minded scientists and inventors, the writers have set up an instance where the show could just keep on going for years, and as long as the writing stays sharp, I hope it does.  I saw the first episode of season 2 last night, and even as good as last season was, this new episode was even better!

What i found cool about the DVD set was the disc trays are made out of a biodegradable material which is essentially paste made out of potatos. It's a lot harder of a substance than you'd think, and actually seems almost as durable as soft plastic, or maybe twice as strong a heavy cardboard. The downside is the little prongs that hold the DVD's in aren't quite strong enough and the DVD's pop out quite often. Hopefully they'll toughen them up a bit for the season 2 set of DVD's.

But Jack starts to suspect that Eureka is a little odd -- a woman making triangular bubbles, a quartet of clones, and a little autistic boy making physics equations on the sidewalk are only a few of the oddities.

His suspicions are confirmed when random places get blasted to ashes, including a cowfield and an RV. So Jack is told Eureka's secret -- it's a town entirely inhabited by geniuses, set up by the government to create new scientific advances. But a scientist has done a little project all on his own, producing a tachyon accelerator -- which is ripping the seams out of the universe.

Because the sheriff was badly injured by the accelerator, D.O.D. representative Allison Blake (Salli Richardson-Whitfield) makes Jack the new sheriff of Eureka. Now he has a new job, a ""smart house"" in an old nuclear bunker, and a trigger-happy deputy who loves her guns.

But he also has has to deal with a bunch of strange problems -- an electrical ""ghost,"" a scientist whose healing experiments transform him, alien paranoia, memory blackouts, a doomsday device from the Cold War, a drug that causes superspeed, killer nanites, problematic pollen, and a mysterious Artifact deep inside the Global Dynamics building...

The first season of ""Eureka"" is a pretty good example of how to make a sci-fi show -- not many programs can balance out standalone episodes with long-term arcs (the Artifact, Beverly's agenda). Some of these don't work out, like the artificial Jack/Allison attraction, but most of the time ""Eureka"" stays on solid ground.

Yeah, most of the storylines center on scientific disasters. But the writers sprinkle it with funny scenarios (the baseball teams are called the Protons and Neutrons) and funny dialogue (""Well, car or no car, this is a 30 mile an hour zone""). But there are moments of poignancy, such as Nathan Stark's tearful farewell to his robot ""son,"" or a woman reluctantly starting to care about her clone's little son.

Despite being the lead, Ferguson doesn't stand out as much because his character is so... ordinary. It's the weirdos that are lovable -- Matt Frewer as a deranged Aussie vet, Ed Quinn as a charming head researcher (and Allison's ex-hubby), Neil Grayston as an ubergeek, and Joe Morton as the car mechanic who also happens to be a brilliant inventer. Jordan Hinson rounds off the cast as Jack's troublemaking daughter.

The first season of ""Eureka"" hits some road bumps, but it's definitely a well-written, intelligent sci-fi series with a quirky, funny twist. Eureka!",1183939200,16,3218,5.079545454545454
2806281,4,B000OY8NII,"Okay, I've read the other reviews and see that what is missing here is a reality check, folks. Eureka is a fun television show. Period. The premise is wacky, as are some of the characters, which makes it all a great hour to spend watching television. I'm not sure the network started out to reinvent ""Star Trek"" (I'm sure not) but merely set out to entertain us, the viewing audience. I, for one, was entertained by this show and intend on TiVo-ing the second season so I don't miss an episode. I happen to like the premise and the commaraderie between the characters. What it boils down to, folks, is that we are all entitled to our own opinion and I, for one, encourage you to take a chance on ""Eureka"" and form your own opinion! After all, this was only the first season, and if I remember correctly, ""Star Trek"" wasn't so great that first season, either, as is the case with most great shows.",1183766400,5,896,4.403614457831325
2806282,5,B000OY8NII,"I started watching the episodes after my father started buying them off of Itunes. I Love the series; it is very well done with cool gadgets, great hummor, a good cast and interesting plot lines for each episode.

It's something new with some great characters, interesting story lines that have you up and down every minute not to mention the creative angle of the show. The acting is incredible. SciFi took a great leap for television kind with Eureka. 2 thumbs all the way up!",1183161600,4,337,4.633333333333334
2806284,5,B000OY8NII,"There are lots of lengthy good reviews so I'll just say this is one of the few shows that interests me on tv.  It has great humor, a great premise and great characters.  The father-daughter relationship of the sheriff is wonderful, love the deputy, the wonderful chef at the cafe, pretty much all the characters.  The humor is intelligent, the stories are entertaining and interesting.  I really, really enjoy this show!  I was so excited to hear the 2nd season was starting.",1183075200,72,475,4.7439024390243905
2806285,5,B000OY8NII,"This is a show that doesn't take itself seriously, so neither should you--relax, it's meant to be funny. I realize that humor is subjective, but if you like it wry, dry and quirky, you'll probably like the high-tech/small town of Eureka and its nerdy/genius denisons. I didn't want to miss a single episode. The writing is sharp, the characters engaging, and the odd mix of classic sci-fi tropes are hilarious. The plots are silly and clever at the same time, with the same reaffirming message: Humanity wins over technology--barely!",1181779200,20,533,5.0
