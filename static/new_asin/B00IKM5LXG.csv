6268380,5,B00IKM5LXG,"This is a great movie.  The writer/director took a tried old story line and breathed exciting life back into it.  You still have the monster searching for the purpose of his creation, yet this time he finds his sole along his journey to enlightenment and final acceptance of himself.  The added twist of the mission of Gargoyles and their link to Arc-angels, was a fresh storyline grabber.  The ending leaves you thinking how will the demon who got away with the down loaded data resurface in the sequel to continue the fallen Prince's plan for humanity.  All in all a great movie.  Don't miss it.",1390521600,5,597,4.6380952380952385
6268381,1,B00IKM5LXG,"Mary Shellys Frankenstein is one of the most easily recognizable characters in the history of storytelling.  Developed in 1818, Frankenstein will likely never be more appreciated than he is in his novelized form.  Over the years, there have been countless film incarnations of the character, the most prominent of which can be found in films that include The Curse of Frankenstein (portrayed by Christopher Lee), Young Frankenstein (portrayed by Peter Boyal) or in one of the more film variations, Mary Shellys Frankenstein (portrayed by Robert De Niro).  And, it was obviously only a matter of time before someone decided to create yet another re-envisioning of the character  which comes in the form of the new film, I, Frankenstein.

From the producers (and a handful of others) that brought us the Underworld saga, Frankenstein  directed by Stuart Beattie (Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl, Australia)  stars Aaron Eckhart as Frankensteins monster, Adam.  Upon his initial awakening, the monster doesnt see eye-to-eye with his creator Victor Frankenstein (Aden young), inevitably leading to Victors death.  Doing the commendable thing, Adam decides to bury his creator  but is randomly attacked by a group of demons, and then saved by a group of gargoyles.

Its at this point that Adam learns from the head of the gargoyle order, Leonore (Miranda Otto), the world is more than it seems, and theres a war going on between Heaven (gargoyles) and Hell (demons).  Feeling isolated and without anyone to guide him, Adam wonders the world for hundreds of years  constantly being hunted by the demons, on orders from their leader, Prince Naberius (Bill Nighy).  Posing as a wealthy industry leader going by the name Charles Wessesx, Prince Naberius is secretly relying on the work of a brilliant doctor, Terra (Miranda Otto), to solve the lost incarnation formula of Victor Frankenstein  with the intent to re-animate his army in waiting.

In the modern day, humans are oblivious to the creatures that are living among them.  Adam, who is constantly being hunted by demons, decides to go on the offensive by eliminating them on his own.  However, during a battle, the death of human quickly leads to the gargoyles (protectors of man) decision to apprehend Adam and confine him for the good of humanity.  Now knowing the location of Adam, Naberius sends an army to apprehend him  putting Adam right in the middle of a brewing war between two very different sides of which he is both skeptical.

Looking at I, Frankenstein as a standalone film is difficult since it resembles the Underworld films so closely.  This storyline basically replaces the gun-toting, leather-drenched Kate Beckinsale with a fit, stick-wielding Aaron Eckhart.  Naturally, if I had to choose  Beckinsale had much more appeal, but its not as though the Underworld films were anything special, either.  The franchise went on far longer than it probably should have, featuring a yawn-worthy drawn out war between vampires and werewolves, while I, Frankenstein features a similar premise  only with gargoyles and demons.  After Underworld: Awakening was released, rumors spread that the Underworld franchise was dead, so apparently the producers have thrown in the towel (for now) with the hopes that this film catches on.  But, to be honest, they shouldnt hold their breath

Obviously, Aaron Eckharts most notable role to date is in playing Two-Face in The Dark Knight, and since then hes really failed to do much to build off that role of lifetime.  Hes starred in Battle: Los Angeles and Olympus Has Fallen  both gaudy and forgettable.  Now, after playing a glorified, one-dimensional Frankenstein in a film that was doomed to fail from the get-go, it won't help his cause in the future for acquiring significant roles.  Eckhart undoubtedly trained extensively for this role, but even with all of the action in this flick, there are still very few moments where Eckhart is able to showcase his acting ability.  Sadly, his version of a Frankenstein is nothing but an epic bore.

While Eckhart was anything but memorable, his nemesis in the film  portrayed by Bill Nighy, was supremely enjoyable.  Nighy, who was also a villain in the majority of the Underworld films, plays a similar character here.  His demeanor is just so powerful and creepy that you cant help but love him every time he plays the bad guys (which is more often than not).  His character quickly establishes himself as a man to be fear, and he sets the battle-centric tone that dominates the majority of the plot.

Even though the cast is relatively expendable (meaning anyone could have done their job), the special effects are the standout achievement.  The beautiful darkness of the city, mixed with the explosiveness of the creatures (both gargoyle and demon) are surprisingly eye-pleasing, making the battle sequences the only part of the film that doesnt make you want to check your watch or implore you to refill your popcorn.  Speaking of visuals, Eckhart looks far too much like Aaron Eckhart and not enough like a monster that was created from eight different corpses.  His voice and attire could have both gone in a better, creepier direction.  After all, Frankenstein should be scary  yet if I ran into Kate Beckinsale in a back alley, Id be far more afraid of her than Eckharts version of Frankenstein.

Overall, I, Frankenstein is handicapped right out of the gate by the fact that it resembles the Underworld franchise  which never really established itself as a commanding set of films to begin with.  This version of Frankenstein is mostly cartoon-ish, and not what youd expect Frankenstein to be in the least.  Director Stuart Beattie shouldnt even bare any of the blame when this film tanks because this script had bad news written all over it before production even started.  But, if Kate Beckinsales Selene character popped out during the credits and was preparing to face-off with Eckhart, maybe then this film would have generated a little excitement.  Unfortunately, that doesnt happen and I, Frankenstein will no doubt land in whatever dark void bad movies go to after they tank at the box office.

6268382,1,B00IKM5LXG,"If Roger Corman made a b-movie copy of ""underworld"", this would be it. Its all the stranger because its a copy of Underworld by some of the people who made underworld. But minus the love.

We get gargoyles versus demons this time with frankenstein caught in the middle. The film really has nothing to do with Frankenstein (the concept) beyond using the name and one pointless scene at the beginning. There is a mad scientist trying to build a zombie army of frankensteins for the demons. This frankenstein spends all his time in the gym and all his money on clothes. He also has to protect the notebook of his father detailing how to create more Frankensteins because he isn't smart enough to destroy it. The film also explains how to bless weapons by drawing on them. Even an undead collection of body parts can bless a weapon.

Its way too heavy on fantasy exposition and a way too talky film. I got to the point several times where I just wanted them to stop talking. There are video-game style fights glued into the film with no particular care.

A strange bit of trivia. The film is usually announced as having been based on a ""graphic novel"" but the graphic novel appears to have been written after the script and if it was ever released, seems to have been released only recently. You can almost see the stretching of the truth that went on to get the film funded.

Its only redeeming quality is that its actually quite short. They say 90 minutes but I think productive film-time is actually less. The cast also looked like they were at least having fun. Its almost so dumb its funny. Maybe on DVD in a few years it will be another beastmaster or road house. But its going to take at least a few years.

I suppose those who liked underworld might like this. But maybe not....",1390521600,4,1782,4.470769230769231

I am sure this is much more enjoyable for those into theology & philosophy asking the question of what man can do & weighing it against what man should do?  Just on its surface its a thrill ride action adventure set in the horror genre & succeeds in entertaining with a lot of action & great cinematography with great use of color to set the mood.  The acting is more than adequate to support the almost nonstop action.  As far as character development it doesn't take long for the anti-hero Adam to endear his character to the audience.  Angelic beings viewed as Gargoyles when in their armored battle mode is definitely not your typical visual of good guys fighting their demonic enemy's but it works well when you study why Gargoyles were placed on buildings.  I don't want to get into to much detail & start giving away spoilers, so I will just say this is a excellent sequel to the updated "" Mary Shelly's Frankenstein""!",1517097600,,1015,4.580110497237569

He is able to bring graphic novels to life and this was no exception. I loved the story line featuring the gargoyles' tale and Miranda Otto brings class and sophistication to any role she plays. The movie was really well cast and besides the obviously well chosen Aaron Eckhart and Miranda Otto, it featured such talented actors as the always polished and charismatic Bill Nighy, the rock solid Jai Courtney as the gargoyle ""general"", for those who appreciate a beautiful female form, there was the striking Yvonne Strahovski from the Dexter series, and the smoldering hot Caitlin Stasey to round a well cast troupe of actors. Its a classic Good vs. Evil and it's a fun buy as long as it's taken as good cinematic story, enjoyable and solid performances by talented actors, and its a solidly enjoyable popcorn movie.",1506211200,,993,4.77906976744186

The writer of Underworld knew he could only milk the ""werewolves & vampires"" thing for so long. The twist at the end is good, as is the action and visual style. Overall, it's not a bad movie (acting is good I thought!) but the story itself saps wawy from it being anything more than forgettable popcorn sci-fi fantasy action.

6268514,5,B00IKM5LXG,"I loved this movie.  Aaron Eckhardt was perfect in his portraysal of the evolution of the lonely, angry, unloved, and soulless ""monster"" to a man with a soul, compassion for others, and a purpose in life.  The story was extremely well written and the cinematography was expertly used.  One example of that was the scene where the mirrored cabinet door is closed to show the reflection of the bare chested Frankenstein.  For me, it was a love story.  The script, Aaron Eckhardt's performance, and the filming were ELEGANT.  You really have to listen or you will miss key information like whether or not Adam has a soul.  In terms of acting, just compare Adam in the scene where the gargoyle queen tries to brush the hair away from Adam's eyes, to the scene where Terra first begins to sew up the wound on Adam's back, to the scene where Abam turns to look at Terra after she tells him that a monster is only a monster if it acts like one.  These are also examples of the use of closeup shots.  Perhaps the most intriguing closeup was near the end of the movie when Adam reaches out to offer Terra his hand to help her get up from the floor where she is sitting.  Her hesitation is notable.  But, she ultimately puts her hand in his and he grasps it.  Why was this scene filmed as a closeup of just hands?  Because it is an elegant way to lead the viewer to speculate.  My conclusion is that Adam has found his companion and that Terra realizes that that relationship will probably not always be platonic.  If you read some negative reviews, I think you will find that elegance was wasted on a lot of viewers.",1481932800,6,1607,4.4

6268566,3,B00IKM5LXG,"I Frankenstein is loosely based upon the Frankenstein monster created by Mary Shelley, with an even looser borrowing from the Bible regarding demons and folklore's gargoyles.  The story starts off 200 years ago with Frankenstein's creation.  Then, with a quick passage of time we arrive at present day.  The monster, played by Aaron Eckhart, is apparently immortal and finds an unlikely ally among the gargoyles.  But, of course there's a problem.  Frankenstein's monster, called Adam, isn't human, nor demon, nor gargoyle.  He doesn't fit anywhere.  Adam is on a quest to learn who, or what, he really is and in present day he finds himself the unwilling participant in a spiritual battle that will lead to either the destruction or salvation of the human race.

I watched it on TV thank the Lord,  and enjoyed the special effects, some of which were really cool.  As, being the Christian  I always have an interest in spiritual matters and how Hollywood portrays them. I laughed out loud when the woman said to hide the book because it tells mankind God did not create mankind. Hollywood thinks they can destroy the belief in God with a fantasy movie.

There is brief obscenity and a lot of violence, along with some graphic demonic portrayals.  Thankfully, there's no nude scenes, homosexuality, or fornication.  It's just a movie loosely based around the 1818 Frankenstein novel with several modern twists, special effects, and well, not the best plot.  But, I never have been one to waste my critical eye upon movies that I know are not meant to be plot development specialties that have well-developed characters with whom we become emotionally attached.  That is why with movies such as I Frankenstein, I watch for the special effects - and I was not disappointed.  However, you might be.  Don't expect a great movie.  But, if you want to be entertained with cool visuals, spiritual battles, and some pretty decent fight scenes, then you will not be disappointed.",1473379200,,1970,4.933130699088146

6268569,4,B00IKM5LXG,"Entertaining action-adventure film with elements of horror.  Gargoyles (sub-angels on the side of good and light) and demons (on the side of evil) have waged a war lasting centuries for the souls of humans and control of the world.  Dr. Frankenstein's creation gets sucked into the fray because he has no soul and the demons can use him to bring the rest of their hordes from hell.  He makes it his centuries-long life's work to descend these evil beings and prevent their plan.  The story, based on a graphic novel (a comic book), is simple.  That works in its favor because it spares us a convoluted story.  The film seems to have an open ending, possibly for sequels.  I don't think that will happen because I understand the film did not do well at the box office.  Some things are not clear to me.  What happens to Frankenstein's creation (called Adam) during the 200 years between his first and second meeting with the gargoyles.  The film implies he had no other life or human interaction except the dispatching of demons.  That's a looong time to be alone.  Also whenever there is a battle between gargoyle and demons there is all kinds of conflagration.  These incidents take place at night in the middle of a large (European?) city but NO ONE (humans) notices what is going on.  And, the demons' headquarters is only a couple of long blocks away from the gargoyles stronghold (an immense cathedral), which is not very strong, and the gargoyles never have a clue until Adam leads them to it.  Still the story is entertaining.  The CG effects are sometimes good, sometimes so-so.  The demon makeup is OK but not overly impressive.  The gargoyle effects are also OK but not a wowser.  Bill Nighy performance as the demon prince masquerading as a magnate businessman comes across as if he's done this a million times before.  He was scarier as the vampire king in Underworld.  The actors playing the gargoyles are very good, especially Miranda Otto as the gargoyle queen, and Jai Courtney as the gargoyle general is smoking hot.  Look at those arms.  The best is Aaron Eckart as Adam.  He conveys the anguish and virtual hopelessness of a solitary creature with no hope of acceptance and companionship with only rage and violence to fill his life.  The makeup is excellent.  The scars, blurred but still highly visible, makes him stand out among humans.  Happily the makeup did not involve a blockhead and bolts.  That is so old hat.  It also doesn't hurt that Eckart's intensity comes across as super sexy.  What a build.  Both he and Courtney are great eye candy for any women viewers.  The ending leaves me somewhat puzzled.  The gargoyle queen says Adam has found his higher purpose.  What's that?  Just eliminating demons?  He's been doing that all along.  Also, does he end up with the pretty doctor or not?  The end suggests yes and no.  Other than that the film is very entertaining, moves along at a brisk pace, and doesn't bore. The DVD I ordered is excellent quality.  Highly recommended.",1472947200,,3004,4.7129094412331405

Good to very good CGI affects.  The story didn't break any new ground with a third party (Frankenstein's Monster) getting caught in the middle of an old conflict between two warring groups.  For me, what saved it from being a two or three star rating was an actor of Aaron Eckart's quality playing the lead character of Frankenstein's monster and the fact that he played it straight not campy.  The end had an interesting twist.

I'm 65, and rarely have I seen a movie that so clearly depicted the battle for good and evil, grace and damnation and did it in an entertaining way.  Special effects were amazing, and the script was so unusual I was totally caught up in this story.  I  think the unashamed use of the reality of God and His power probably affected it's box office returns.  There was no shying away from the certainly that God exists and we are being watched over by his guardians and angels - tho albeit having those guardians as gargoyles was unusual but fascinating.

6269884,4,B00IKM5LXG,"I had never heard anything about this movie before watching it. I thought it was a good movie. There is a great amount of action. I appreciate that the director used both the good and the dark side of the main character, Adam/Frankenstein (Aaron Eckhart). The back story to how Frankenstein came to be is brief but it doesn't have to be very detailed because most people already know the story of Frankenstein.

There are ties into a Christian beliefs, but they are very basic. The movie does a good job at distinguishing the roles of the gargoyles and the demons. I also appreciated that they didn't use a cross for their symbol. They used something similar but I found it nice not to have the cross thrown around all over the place.

I found that the sound track was very well chosen and help build the correct emotions in each part of the movie.

The only downside to this movie that I find, is that it is predictable and they try and tie in a weird love story that never really develops well.

Overall I give ""I, Frankenstein"" three stars because it was entertaining, a good action movie, and because it brought a good twist to the story of Frankenstein.",1461283200,9,1158,4.4739336492890995

""It doesnt break new ground but I, Frankenstein is not the ridiculous train wreck that some hardcore movie buffs were expecting. The film is unlikely to win-over potential viewers that were never on-board with the (arguably) campy premise, but for fantasy action fans that have been entertained by similar updates to movie monsters in the past, I, Frankenstein successfully delivers enough slick action choreography and interesting mythology to provide fun (though admittedly dopey) escapism. If nothing else, Grevioux and Beattie have established an interesting sandbox  one that, given a stronger story and more developed characters, might even be worth revisiting."" from [...]",1458000000,,794,5.285714285714286

The story tended to drag in many areas though and was overall not original or exciting to watch unfold. The acting was monotone and characters seemed to show little emotion throughout the movie, Frankenstein's monster I am not sure can show emotion but it did not add the the other characters acting. Overall if you are a big monster movie buff and what a different take on the Frankenstein franchise you might enjoy it, if however you are looking for an action packed monster verse monster brawl I would recommend Underworld.",1458000000,,655,4.754385964912281

6270351,4,B00IKM5LXG,"The movie presents a refreshingly new twist on the done-to-death theme of the original Zombie yet remains true to the idea of the abandoned and tormented Monster.

Talking Miranda Otto and Bill Nighy into this was a major accomplishment and keeps the inherently over the top characters of the leaders of the Light and the Dark from becoming one dimensional. They each portray hidden secrets with such ease that we know when they're hiding something even when we don't know what it is.

Aaron Eckhart as the Monster manages to sell both the bitterness and his eleventh hour conversion as well as anyone could. And Yvonne Strahovski is rather past breathtaking in her somewhat underwritten Mad Scientist role. She also looks quite at home in a Gothic cityscape that resembles Poland much more than the Melbourne where it was filmed.

Even the guardians of the Light had enough rough edges to make well defined characters.

It's too bad the quite good CGI amped up the budget to the point it couldn't be recovered.",1457913600,,1011,4.826589595375722

All flippancy aside, this is one incredibly fabulous monster movie, an unheralded gem I happened to stumble across.  Aaron Eckhart makes a surprisingly good Frankenstein's monster (intelligent, not totally brutish, just as he is in Shelley's opus), and the essential idea of angelic gargoyles versus demons is a tour-de-force of originality.

Bill Nighy plays the demon leader in exactly the same way as he did the Viktor in Underworld and Miranda Otto didn't depart very far from any of her familiar roles.

Other than being written by someone who obviously has a drug habit, the film has some nice effects and acting was good.  In a way it even paid respect to the power of God.

6270660,2,B00IKM5LXG,"Ridiculous, but kinda cool in a superhero way. I got it with Prime, otherwise I would not recommend paying for it. It's a conglomeration of God Vs the Devil, where the Devil hires demons (same old same old) but God hires Gargoyles. Well, in ancient lore, Gargoyles are supposed to be protective. Anyway, God's gargoyles with the help of Frankenstein's monsters kill the devils demon bad guys. Think along the lines of Underworld, but more campy and simplistic. Underworld, by the way, is x10 better than this movie, but not really a fair comparison because this movie doesn't take itself too seriously, and is is meant to be cute, fun, and depth-less, while Underworld was meant to be serious and foreboding.",1456790400,,708,4.859504132231405

The title is a slight throw off, but it has now earned a well deserved reputation as being one of the best movies of this genre made by Hollywood.  Booyah!  A tremendous team effort and a tremendous movie.  It reminded me of my first reaction to the movie ""The Matrix"" knowing how good ""Star Wars"" was ... all I can say is WOW.

The 3D effect was up to par with movies such as avengers or captain america. Soundtrack and surround effects are done right with plenty of action on the surround channels.  Acting is acceptable for this genre and way above B-movie quality.

6271395,5,B00IKM5LXG,"So many ""horror"" movies depend on plenty of gore or incredible special effects to try to achieve something and they fail, sometimes miserably.  No really intense special effects, just some makeup and some CGI work but some very good acting and a story that is a truly interesting extension of the original movie and book.  Perhaps I simply like depth more than gore but I will not apologize for it.  A good story beats special effects any day.  This was a classic good versus evil with some truly interesting plot issues.  Can something created from dead parts develop a soul?  What kind of a way would such a being make in the modern world where people no longer believe in good and evil, just black, gray and white.  I really enjoyed this movie and I hope you will as well.",1453334400,,775,4.492857142857143

I had my doubts going in about Aaron Eckhart portraying Frankenstein's monster, as I had not read the graphic novels and was unaware of the character that had been unleashed in Kevin Grevioux's version. And this one is so different from others! Suffice it to say Eckhart delivers, as do the other main characters. The acting overall is quite good. Some scenes, as with almost any action sequenced movie today, are overdone, but not to any bad extreme. Gargoyles, who have been named as guardians of the human race (by none other than the Archangel Gabriel) come to life and battle evil shape-shifting demons ... what is not to love.",1451433600,,733,4.825396825396825

6272219,4,B00IKM5LXG,"Two Hundred years have passed since 'Victor Frankenstein' created a living being.
'Victor' died trying to find his creation to exact revenge for the death of his wife at
the hands of the creature, however 'Victor' had frozen to death in his pursuit.
The 'Demon Prince' failed to capture 'Victor's' creature back then because of the
intervention of 'Mankind's' protectors, 'The Gargoyles' who fight off the 'Demons'
the Prince had sent.
The Gargoyle Queen gives the creature a name 'Adam'
'Adam hides himself away until present day when he returns into civilization, he finds
things are very different today.
The Demon Prince 'Naberius' (Bill Nighty) after all these years still wants to capture
'Adam' ( Aaron Eckhart) to examine how he was brought to life by 'Victor' all those
years ago, 'Naberius' has an army of tens of thousands of corpses to bring back to life
under his command, at this stage 'Naberius' is unaware that 'Victor's' journal has survived
down the years.
The 'Gargoyles' lead as before by 'Leonore' (Miranda Otto) come to aid again of 'Adam'
'Adam' needs answers he befriends the scientist 'Terra' who is working at 'Naberius's'
Lab, but is unaware of who her boss really is.
If the corpses are given life, 'Mankind' could be wiped out, 'Adam' finds himself embroiled
in a deadly battle of 'Good against Evil'
(This release is in both 3-D and 2-D)
The film is jam-packed with stunning special effects, the 'Gargoyles' and 'Demons' a work
of art to behold, terrific battle/action scenes.....Many Critic's and Reviewers have slated
this spectacle, well, the film was made to entertain.......it certainly entertained me, put me
in mind of the '2004' 'Hugh Jackman' - 'Kate Beckinsale' movie 'VAN HELSING'
I'd say, if you enjoy fantasy adventure movies....This could well be worth watching at least.

6272289,4,B00IKM5LXG,"I like this movie.  It is an adaptation of a graphic novel series, as I understand.  Aaron Eckhart does a good job as Frankenstein's Monster.  Bill Nighy does a very good job as his nemesis.  Jai Courtney and Yvonne Strahovski give credible performances.  It is an interesting take on the Frankenstein story, with a little twist extending the story into the current era.  Special effects are competent and don't try to overpower the story too much.  All in all, an enjoyable movie.  Too bad it got panned by the critics.  Lately, I've looked at movies with the view that if critics liked it, I probably wouldn't very much and vice-versa.",1445731200,,637,4.718181818181818

Anyhow, watch this if you like watching an immortal super human bust through waves of bad guys (sometimes good guys) and gets the girl at the end.

A soul as grand as the super human he has become.

6272777,2,B00IKM5LXG,"This just didn't meet expectations. Your mileage may vary, depending how great your expectations are. It came down to whether 3D Blu-ray is sufficient reason to justify a purchase.

Bought this because it was
1. in 3D,
2. Didn't remember having seen it before,
3. Thought Aaron Eckhardt was a good enough actor that he could carry the plot, and
4. Have a fondness for variations on the Frankenstein's monster theme for which we are all indebted to Mary Shelley.

Returned it, unopened, because
1. The significant other had seen some of it in 2D and didn't like it at all.
2. She remembered having seen it and reminded me that we had stopped watching it in 2D because the plot was so far afield from Shelley's original intent that I gave up on it shortly within the first few minutes - why didn't I remember seeing it before? Hadn't really seen it before.
3. Eckhardt was decent costarring with Gwyneth Paltrow in ""Possession"" a cerebral historical literary mystery/romance, but there's no Gwyneth for him to pal around with in this one - just a lot of CGI and special effects that probably would have looked cool in 3D, but in the end
4. Would have been just a tale told for idiots, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing (to misquote another English lit favorite). Likable or not, Aaron is no Robert De Niro as Frankenstein's monster, and whoever wrote this script is neither Mary Shelley nor William Shakespeare.",1442361600,,1418,4.668

I don't know who the choreographed this but they need to be fired out of a cannon somewhere he can't make stunts and fight scenes.  The producer had no sense of physics.  For example, there is a scene where Adam hits a garbage dumpster and keeps moving.  First off the height he hit it from should have caused more impact and movement of the dumpster but instead he just rolls off and keeps going.  Even children pick up on this.  Second he is supposed to be bad ass with all this power but he appears as a weakling most of the time.  If the guy can break walls with his stupid devil sticks then he should be able to run faster and jump higher but he is completely limited.  I don't understand the point of making a movie about supernatural beings with supernatural powers but sparsely using them.  It was as if superman was radically near Kryptonite.",1442188800,,955,4.4

6273315,5,B00IKM5LXG,"Engaging plot.  Intriguing mythology, well developed and presented.  Excellent performance by great actors.  Seamless special effects, lighting, and Foley work.  Well-paced development of the story.  These add up to a thorougly enjoyable film that becomes even more intiguing as I continue to think about it.

If you have a narrow definition of ""Frankenstein"" in your mind, the short blurb alone ought to warning enough that this film will not match your expections: ""Frankenstein's monster becomes involved in  war between two immortal clans.""  It's not a horror story; no jump sees, not a lot of scary grue.  The only humans threatened on screen are two of the primary characters plus one luckless policeman; and there's no laboriously dragged-out tension about the threat to them.  It's not a monster flick; no giant beasties running around eating people.  And it most certainly is not the political drivel that has been oozing out of Hollywood for the past decade.

It also is certainly not an attempt to faithfully retell Mary Shelly's original tale; but then, not movie ever has.  A couple of films have come close, notably ""Mary Shelley's Frankenstein,"" and been panned by the critics who expected a scary horror story.  (They called that one too slow, too cerebral; but hey, read the original story.  You'll see.)

""I, Frankenstein"" certainly has a cerebral undertone, but it doesn't belabor it.  Here we have a man, perhaps with no soul, caught up in a battle between the minions of Heaven and those of Hell.  We see his character develop from the amoral sociopath of his back story into a champion for the forces of good.  It's not a love story, but there's a love interest that develops along the way.

In short, it's a story about Frankenstein's monster becoming a superhero, defending mankind against the forces of evil; masterfully presented by Kevin Grevioux and Stuart Beattie.",1439942400,2,1893,5.02572347266881

Aaron Eckhardt is easy on the eyes too so that never hurts!

Well, let's put it this way.....not as long as you're not looking for a real Frankenstein movie.
It's really just a special effects movie with tons of action.
So, if that's what you like then you will like this.
The story was not bad either...but is really just an excuse for huge battle scenes......which were AWESOME....especially the last one.

Cast / Acting: 5 out of 5 - I never thought to myself OMG this is horrible. The acting was really good.
Writing / Plot: 4 out of 5 - It's not deep but you keep watching. There are no twists or surprises and the ending is predictable but....it's good.
Special FX : 5 out of 5 - It was NUTS - everything had detail. Everything was quality. You never look and think that is so cheap. They did a great job.

It's worth the risk and if you a prime member it's FREE!  Try it because I think you will like it.  :-)",1437696000,,924,4.203389830508475

I wanted something to watch and didn't really see anything that was grabbing me, so I thought I would give it a try.  I ended up really liking it.  I will say that part of the reason is I really like gargoyles, and I loved the way they were portrayed in the movie.

In the end, I  was not sure if he gets the girl or he doesn't, or if the idea of him getting the girl was creepy and gross or okay. I was also not sure if the girl was just resigned to being with him because he saved everyone and was so pathetic and lonely or if she liked him in a boy-girl way or a mad-scientist-experiment way.

Adam's allies, the Gargoyles, were also ambivalent. They did some really nasty things considering they were the good guys.
The bad guys really didn't do anything that bad until the end. Their purpose was sinister, but we saw no evil acts on their part until the last half hour. The demons were hideous, but other than that, not really feeling the evil.",1436572800,2,868,4.274390243902439

6274410,2,B00IKM5LXG,"I very intentionally try to not go so far as to actually hate a film. I am at least somewhat aware of how challenging it can be to complete such a monumental task of producing a major motion picture. I know a lot of people worked very, very hard to produce ""I, Frankenstein"", so for their efforts alone, I award it 2 stars, instead of only 1, which on its own merit as a form of pop culture horror entertainment it is scarcely even deserving. Sorry, man, but no matter how much elbow grease your pour into it, you....just....can't....polish a turd.

And that's pretty much what ""I, Frankenstein"" is. It's a real mess.

I won't go into detail about the specifics of where this film falters. There are many reviews already posted here that do it very comprehensively.

But as a thumbnail review, I'll just say this:

The screenwriter and cast of ""Underworld"" basically watched ""Van Helsing"" and asked themselves, ""How can we make this worse?""

6274738,3,B00IKM5LXG,"I, Frankstein is a standard summer movie, nothing really fantastic but nonetheless alright. Aaron Eckhart plays the Frankenstein monster, a creature who does not fight for good (as Gargoyles do) or evil (as the Demons do). Frankenstein decides to abandon the world and for 200 years lives alone, until Demons find him. In a homage to the Blade and Underworld series, I, Frankenstein then decides to hunt down the demons before they capture him.

The film itself does not contain anything special, in terms of special effects, sound, cinematography, or any other element for that matter. The plot is standard good vs. evil with a plot line that is altogether too predictable. At times, Eckhart's performance is reminiscent to Christian Bale's Batman more than a stand alone performance, though in the end the actor holds his own weight in the role.

Overall, if you find yourself bored one day this is an alright film to pass the time with. Just do not expect anything groundbreaking or revolutionary. You will only be disappointed.",1434326400,,1031,4.988372093023256

6274741,3,B00IKM5LXG,"Disclaimer: I watched this movie while making/eating dinner as well as doing the dishes, so I didn't devote my full attention.

That said... this movie didn't have as clich&eacute; of a storyline as I expected, but it wouldn't win any Oscars either. The performances by the actors helped the movie instead of hurting it, and the cast housed some bigger names than one might expect (Bill Nighy, Miranda Otto, Yvonne Strahovski). There are some impressive action sequences coupled with a dark atmosphere which give this world life.
Without giving too much away, the story is about the monster created by Dr. Frankenstein (Aaron Eckhart), and a demon named Naberius who is hunting him to find a way to recreate Frankenstein's work. The monster, named 'Adam', by the Queen of the Gargoyles, falls into a war between the two and chooses to fight on his own side.

All in all, I enjoyed the movie. If you are a sci-fi/fantasy/action film buff, then this is a good one to add to the list. It isn't quite as good as the Underworld series, but it holds its own amongst similarly-themed movies.",1434326400,,1084,4.76063829787234

The only reason I did not give it five stars was because I have seen much better 3D effects in a movie. Avatar, for example, had awesome 3D effects. This movie's 3D effects were just so-so.

The dark lord of infinite evil sets forth to consume all the world and bring back the age of chaos. The truth and light of the universe battle the evil to keep order and protect humanity. It is a great epic drama filled with plenty of action, passion and spectacle fit for a gamer. I just feel the story may be a bit ""monochrome"". It did justify my expense for a theatre quality sound system.

The effects where what one would expect in this ""big popcorn"", wall rattling spectacle. The CGI was tight, I did feel that it was a bit too much. Like ""Van Helsing"", ""I, Frankenstein"" relied heavily on the CGI which stripped the film down to a ""basic"", going through the emotions action film.

6275292,2,B00IKM5LXG,Action packed with a different version of the classic tale but typical good against evil with the good looking scientist as the main female character.  Very predictable story.,1431734400,,175,5.25

6275305,3,B00IKM5LXG,"""I, Frankenstein"" is interesting to look at, and the mythology in the story line is a bit fun, if often poorly thought out in the details.  I often wonder why makers of movies like this don't do the tiny bit of tweaking that would help the viewer to suspend disbelief more easily.  I would have come up with at least a rudimentary explanation for why a huge cathedral chock-full of supernatural beings would not be really obvious to all the regular people around.  I would also have made the gargoyles with a larger wingspan and less heavy bodies so that their flying would seem at least somewhat credible.  It is really hard to get involved in a movie when you are always shaking your head.  The last big problem with it is the doomy music constantly trying to substitute for plot.  Cellos play ponderous low notes, drums beat, violins make jittery screeches on top.  I found myself MST3K -like commenting and singing Doo dooooo-dooo along with the cellos.  In fact it would be fun to MST3K this movie!  Having said all of that, the lead is nice to look at and it is pretty in general.  Expect little and you can enjoy it.  Alternatively, get together with a bunch of friends, some beer and popcorn, and make fun of it while you watch it.",1431734400,2,1239,4.486607142857143

The majority of the cast (including completely out-of-place ""bad guy"" Bill Nighy) is simply recycled from UNDERWORLD... but at 1/3rd the production value.  You'll recognize the ""surly gargoyle"" as the secondary villain from Jack Reacher, the lead scientist as ""dat ass"" from Mass Effect 2 & 3, and that's about it.  The concept (Frankenstein's Monster as an anti-hero) is fantastic.  The implementation (garbage CGI, bizarrely pseudo-christian story, and limp acting) is absolutely horrible.

not after people paid to see 7 Fast n Furious movies and all the crap Hollyweird makes that over 2,000 people gave this good reviews! This
is why Hollyweird continues to make crap and unoriginal remakes with nothing but CGI special effects with horrible acting and scripts and
directing. I guess all the technology has made people brain dead to original well written stories with good acting and directing for CRAP!

Bill Nighy was great, but limited by his crappy dialogue. So mostly it's the writing I found terrible.

6276513,4,B00IKM5LXG,"Judging by the reviews and reception, I expected this movie to be bad. Thus I was pleasantly surprised when I saw it. Don't get me wrong; this movie isn't going to thrill you or get on the same shelf as Lord of the Rings. But it's got a decent enough, if predictable, storyline with some fun effects and good eye candy (and I don't mean sexually; there's very little sexuality in the film. I mean FX). I said it's like Underworld because SO many of the actors and sets are from Underworld, though it's not as good as the Len Wiseman/Kate Beckinsale film. Similar story, though. So, if you like FX or gothic sci-fi, this is worth the 90 minutes it'll occupy. If you want something that gets your brain thinking deep and hard or something epic, you might want to pass this one by.

One caveat: the one effect that is pretty lousy is the demon masks/make-up. They're pretty corny. And there's a good bit of slow-mo in this film, too. If you're not a fan of dramatic slow-mo, you might find parts of this movie pretty slow-moving (no pun intended). If you like slow-mo to look at the gorgeous city-scapes and effects and stuff, you'll dig it.",1428105600,,1138,4.444976076555024

6276923,3,B00IKM5LXG,"I never read the graphic novels but had expectations that the movie would be OK. After watching, I would say average is the highest I could go. Special effects - great. Story - meh. And I'm an Aaron Eckhart fan. Poor Bill Nighy (who I also like) is as usual typecast as a leader of evil beings, in this case demons.

I felt like there needed to be more explanation to flesh the story out better. OK, a war between demons and gargoyles for hundreds/thousands of years that humans don't know about? Uh-huh. No one notices gargoyles flying around? And a massive church-like structure that is home to the gargoyles in the middle of human town with gargoyles flying in and out of and hundreds of demons attacking and turning to flames? Sure, you say, you need to suspend disbelief. And I agree, and I did suspend disbelief with Frankenstein's monster (Adam) living for hundreds of years and the whole demon vs. gargoyle thing. Then, they spend the movie saying when a demon dies, soul goes down and stay down and when gargoyle dies, soul goes up and stays up.

But at the climax, they are reanimating corpses with the souls of demons brought up from hell. Victor Frankenstein never factored the soul into his reanimation, so the demons just figured that out on their own? I could probably go on with questions like that that will go unanswered....

In the end, I gave the movie 3 stars for being mildly entertaining as an action movie and because I like the concept and the genre. I probably would have given it 2.5 if I could have but I couldn't bring myself to give it a 2 meaning I don't like it. Will I watch it again? No. Was it worth the $0 I spent to watch it on Prime?

6277139,2,B00IKM5LXG,"Quick Story blurb:  Victor Frankenstein reanimates life as the same as the old Frankenstein story.  The difference in this story is the Frankenstein monster is hunted by demons so they can use him for their purposes. The monster decides to fight with the Gargoyles who are like angels to stop the demons from taking over the world.  I like the idea of bringing Frankenstein back to life on screen but just not like this.

The acting is decent, Aaron Eckarrt does the best job he can as a more human and superhero like Frankenstein, but he might as well just been a normal guy.  I feel like the makeup team failed him miserably to really make him more of a monster.  He had stitches but nothing else about him looked like he was 8 different pieces of a corpse.  With that said, he did ok as did everyone else, but no one really had a wow or standout performance.

Overall, the movie is just alright, a lot more bad in there than good though.  There are some neat effects and fight scenes but it feels like the movie is too forced in plot and direction.  It's really predictable and a lot of recycled elements from other vampire war movies like Underworld.  I think the movie suffered because they tried so hard to set it up for a sequel,  (some big hints in there, with the body farm comment from the dark prince and guy with the USB drive)  however,  this movie isn't strong enough that I hope they don't try to.  I thought it was dumb how they named Frankenstein, ""Adam"" in the movie.  I understand what they may have been thinking.  Adam in the bible was the first man with a soul, Adam in this movie is the first man without a soul. However, it just sounded so ridiculous coming out of the mouth of the queen, ""I shall name you..........Adam""  I sat there laughing, thinking about other dumb names to call him, ""I shall call you.....Bill.""  I think they should have just left him nameless or just called him Frankenstein the whole movie.  Also, I didn't like how they built up he could feel no pain (he lived through the freezing temps when Victor Frankenstein didn't)  then they have him flinch and act hurt when the scientist is stitching him up with a needle.  DUMB.

The movie hovers between a 2 and 3 rating.  I'm giving it a 2 because while it can be an average movie for movie night - the fact that I was sitting back making fun of ridiculous elements of the movie (not able to suck me into their world for a few hours), tells me this movie honestly isn't that good.  I'd suggest finding a better movie in this genre to waste time on...Try Blade or Interview with a Vampire or go 80s with The Lost Boys, all of which are superior to this one.",1426636800,,2652,4.341463414634147

Aaron Eckhart is one of my favorite actors and he did not disappoint in this movie, he is one actor who will never fit a Hollywood stereo type.  The Plot, Story and Characters captured my attention in the fist 2 minutes of the movie, from there I was hooked for the next 90 minutes.  Would I watch it again? Probably, if for no other reason than to enjoy the special effects all over again. Oh and to watch good kick evil back to, well, you know where....",1425513600,,654,4.3884297520661155

6277729,3,B00IKM5LXG,"It's not the best movie, but it's also not the worst. I felt the actors made you believe their characters and the special effects were pretty good. The movie is an adaptation of what I grew up with when Boris Karloff played most of the monsters. Here Frankenstein deals with moral issues and as in ""A Hero's Journey"" develops conflict both internally and externally. Since I have Amazon Prime Instant the price was good. If this wasn't an option I would probably wait to rent it at Redbox. I wouldn't suggest paying any on-demand price of $5.99. As I said, it was entertaining and the actors kept my attention and brought the characters to life. As for the plot and writing, it could have been a little better to get 4or 5 stars.",1425340800,,729,4.488721804511278

I'm glad I didn't pay full price to see it in a movie theatre, but for a Saturday afternoon, streaming a movie from my computer in my bedroom, it was good enough.",1425340800,,390,4.542857142857143

Laughable attempt to take a couple of somewhat interesting concepts about Frankenstein's monster that could have played well and ham-handedly force them into a combination of rehashed plot lines that end up in a pool of cinematic drivel . Cap it off with terrible effects and a script that was assuredly written by the very best fourth graders money can buy. The pretense of the pro / antagonist lines. Gargoyles and Demons.  I get the Demons angle. Ok that works. Who fights Demons, wears armor and has wings......Gargoyles. Really? Maybe these hacks were afraid of getting too close to Dan Brown to call them Angels. In my mind I see Frankenstein's monster as a slow moving yet incredibly strong force of nature. If he were to grab the bad guys and tear them apart with his bare hands? I'm in. But not happening. Instead we have Frankenstein's monster doing some painfully choreographed martial arts action to fight the impending Demon menace. Yeah. They'll sex it up. Well played.  Unfortunately I do like Aaron Eckhart so I hope this schmaltzy stink burger won't taint his career.

I've always hoped that someday there would be a faithful adaption to Mary Shelly's book...this film is not only NOT that film; but its only connection to the novel is a short synopsis of its plot as background material and yes I know it was based on a graphic novel.  But that isn't even the worst of it.  If the war between Heaven and Hell wasn't bad enough as a totally irrelevant plot device (shades of Constantine) it was nothing compared to the phoned-in performances of virtually everyone in it. Clearly, no one cared for this film except as a paycheck. I will give Aaron Eckhart some credit.  As the title character he did try to make it work; but the script kept getting in his way.  Ultimately, he just seemed to bellow his lines in the hope that he could bulldoze his way through the mess.  It didn't work.  Dont waste your time streaming this movie.

I was utterly floored by how good this take on the never-ending Frankenstein myth really was! Mary Shelley, Braum Stoker, even Dean Koontz wrote a series about the creature named after his creator, Victor Frankenstein. And I was amazed at the heavy hitter acting involved in this movie. Bill Nighy (Underworld) Miranda Otto (Lord of the Rings) Jai Courtney (Jack Reacher) Aaron Eckhart (Bat man) just to name a few! Talk about casting! And the plot was very interesting: unbeknownst to us clueless humans, the Gargoyles that have sat atop gothic architecture for centuries, warding off evil, are in fact REAL. And they are at war with demons. Protecting us. Watching over our world...The demon Lord (played awesomely by Nighly) wants the secret of Victor Von Frankenstein process to reanimate the dead in order to bring forth an army of reanimated corpses --providing bodies for the hellspawn-- to annihilate the human race. Leaving only enough to serve as slaves as the world we live in becomes Hell on earth. Frankensteins Monster is renamed 'Adam' by the Gargoyle queen. Their first meeting does not go well, so the former monster is cast adrift...Adam wants only to find his creator's book...to find out who, and what he is. And, in the original Frankenstein story, Victor promises Adam a companion, then murders her. In a rage, Adam murders Victors wife in revenge...the only human life he has ever taken. For two centuries the demons pursue him. He fights the demons on his own, in his own way... fighting, in hopes of gaining redemption...and his greatest wish: another companion. This is a fantastic movie. Great spin on this timeless classic! You will recognize several characters from the Underworld series playing in this one. (I loved that series) Great acting all around.

6278840,1,B00IKM5LXG,"Raise your hand if you've seen Underworld.  Now, raise your hand if, while watching Underworld, you thought it had too big a budget, or too many big words like ""wolf"" or ""injection"" or ""pay""?  If your hand happened to shoot up anywhere in that, have I got the movie for you.

I'm a pretty forgiving person.  As a friend of mine told me recently: ""For someone who likes movies, you sure don't know a thing about movies"", and he's not entirely wrong.  I've mentioned this before, but there are times I want to pay for my ticket and watch giant robots.  There are times I look forward to an hour and a half of ninjas fighting.  Maybe even two hours.  So in this way, a movie about Demons battling Gargoyles should be something which catches my attention.  I mean, right there I'd traditionally be sold.  The trouble, however, starts when the movie starts.  There's about two minutes of ""fine"", and it then goes downhill.  How?  Well:

Ever watch a home movie you made as a kid or someone you knew as a kid made, and it was filled with a lot of what they thought looked cool?  Like parkour which wasn't really parkour, but just some dude(s) jumping off a low ledge screaming?  And whoever was in charge of the fight choreography realized they weren't all that great, so the camera had to just cut away when the action started, equally saving the special effects people from needing to know how to run a computer?  The opening's a lot like that.  From there, you have gargoyles who don't look anything like gargoyles, and gargoyles who all look the same except for the gargoyle boss or queen or whatever she is, which doesn't make any sense because the other gargoyle ladies look like the gargoyle men, but eh, and the Demons they're fighting all have different guises, so that could be where the bulk of the money went, who knows, but goodness.  The gargoyles fight for God, because... sure.  Gargoyles have wings.  Angels have wings.  Okay.  Fine.  Demons don't, so they're mad at one another.  Bill Nighy is in it as King Demon.  I've decided he's playing the same character from Underworld only in disguise, making him actually a Demon Vampire King, though this won't save the plot or the movie.  Aaron Eckhart is terrible.  Sure the script is Star Wars prequel level with a mix of special needs, and I'm willing to assume Eckhart lost a bet or is being blackmailed or wants a new house.  Still.  Man.  Also, for two groups who supposedly live in the shadows, they sure do an awful lot of flying around the city, and an awful lot of fighting with explosives outside the giant gothic cathedral which is like ten stories tall.  Perhaps the two pedestrians I saw account for their ability to stay secret.  I don't know.

As a forgiving person, I can usually find fun in most anything.  There's a handful of movies so awful they slide into boring and have no redeeming properties, of which this falls.  If I spend the bulk of your film with a concerned look on my face, and I'm not watching Aronofsky, something's gone wrong.  When you can't make exploding Demons good, you should maybe hang up your hat.  Or your camera.  And burn them.

I have nothing else to say.  This brief review fluctuated for a time between what you're reading now, and just a .gif of me shaking my head.",1421539200,9,3274,4.51877133105802

Lots of focus on action scenes, some nice aesthetics at parts, but overly religious which is annoying in a movie based a book that was subtitled ""The Modern Prometheus"".

Characters are rather flat, though acting isn't bad.  Too many cliche plot elements.

Overall all I'd give it a 2.5 but Amazon won't let me.  I'm not telling you to avoid it, just advising you that it may not be what you are expecting if you are a fan of the original ""Frankenstiein"" story or expecting a movie that broke some ground.

6278854,5,B00IKM5LXG,"I, FRANKENSTEIN

I have to say that I really enjoyed this movie; it could have been really bad if handled incorrectly. Thankfully this was done right as far as an action movie wrapped in a horror style type flick goes. This is one of those movie in which you just lay back and have a good time. We watched this along with The Legend of Hercules and both were good. This one is more my style though with the whole Frankenstein thing.

Dr. Frankenstein is now dead after a long unsuccessful hunt for his creature, who had killed his wife. That leaves his creation all alone in the world with no one or nothing like him. But because of this he is about to enter a world in which no human even knows about, the demons who walk the Earth and their battle with the Gargoyles sent from Heaven. It is a battle he wants no part of, he wishes not to help any human cause which is what the gargoyles are here for. But it is the demons who want him and the secret that lies within his body.

I have to say that this was a fun movie with a really good story, which is based on the graphic novel of course. The biggest selling point of this flick though is the action; the fighting here is great with some really cool moments. The acting of course is great with people like Aaron Eckhart and Bill Nighy staring here, all were great in this film. I love the look of the flick as well and the style here, it fits the horror/action story very well.

Still one of the best things about this is that we get two commentaries and behind the scenes stuff on the disc. The commentaries are the selling point for me, I love them. Over all I had a good time watching this flick and while I may have given it four stars for the movie the commentaries and such bring it up to five.",1421193600,3,1754,4.134897360703812

By the way, the vampi.. err... demons and ange... err.. gargoyles have their headquarters just down the street from one another, because if you're basically making all your supernaturals talk with a british accent, they all have to live in the same tony part of town.

Probably would have been better to place him in the remake of the Wizard of Oz, where he could have a nice song and dance 'If I Only Had a Soul'.

Eckhart's acting ended up being the only cheesy element, but for what he was given, it was a decent enough performance. The gargoyles were awesome, the fight sequences were darn cool and for those romantic types, it looks like Adam (Frankenstein) may have gotten himself a hot girlfriend at the end.

Aaron Eckhart, Miranda Otto (Eowyn from the Lord of the Rings Trilogy) and Bill Nighy are in this movie. These are very decent actors and I thought, ""If these actors are in it, it should be pretty good.""

I am not a script writer. I don't know but it seems to me that there wasn't enough story there so they had to throw in CG filler. A lot of CG filler. Too much CG filler.

Aaron Eckhart is the only enticing portion of the film but, with a role that was given no justice in the writing process, even his inclusion is vastly overlooked by the audience as they are barraged by the numerous tasteless elements of the production.

The story seems like it came from the drawing board of a twelve year old, relying on the classic Frankenstein story, the old ""demons vs. guardians"" conflict, and the gothic elements.  I would describe the film as a horrifically constructed fanfiction that almost wanted to be a cheesy video game more than a film.

You will find yourself cringing throughout the film and hard-pressed not to give up part way through.  My applause to anybody that even makes it past the halfway mark.

However, perhaps, by this particular juncture of his stretch n vamp sub genre titles, he appears to be getting a little campy in his turn as Vampire King, Demon Prince, Flying Dutchman, etc., etc. The little twist of the hips as he advances on the set of the Biological Experiment Which Will Ruin Humanity seems to betray just a hint of the bemusement he might feel at ""coming out,"" once again, as the Force Which Will End the World As We Know It. But still, he's in great shape for a guy his age- kudos for that. As for the rest of the cast, Aaron Eckhardt must have really needed the money. The blonde Australian girl is in really great shape as well, although, my bet is she's far better in the last 24 installment than as the World's Most Respected ""Electro- Physicologist!"" Really? As for the plot? Some of the gargoyles seem to possess powers of generosity as they represent the cathedral of Notre Dame against the onslaught of the Umbrella Corp, excuse me, the Demon Corp, excuse me, it gets confusing after a while, but.

and you enjoyed (to some degree) the Underworld style of moviemaking,
then you'll probably like this film.
It takes an interesting idea (Frankenstein monster) into today's world, as he never died.
But then immediately goes off interesting concept to supernatural underworld thriller.
Frankenstein is beseiged by demons (not internal, which would be interesting, but Buffy-the-Vampire style), and in killing one, gains the attention of the (supposedly) good faction represented by Gargoyles.
Frankenstein monster is caught in the middle of this war, much less a monster than a misunderstood man.
I like the way Frankenstein was played. All other actors and actresses in this movie were cookie-cutter 2D characters, and it was OK, as long as you turn off your brain and enjoy it for what it is.

This movie however within the first 2 minutes I knew would be a special exception, even still I did watch the whole entire disaster.

Of course comparisons will be made. the James Whale version is the gold standard. This is not a remake of the Frankenstein legend. It is much more a sequel, it picks up where the novel and other film versions leave off and it literally brings Frankenstein's Monster into the 21st Century. I gave it 4 stars because I liked it. I watched it late night and intended only to watch a scene or two. I watched the whole thing because it held my interest. I liked the gargoyle vs. demon conflict and the way the ""monster"" was drawn into this conflict. I enjoyed the touch of romance that the ""monster"" enjoyed with the scientist love interest. I would have preferred to see that relationship developed a little bit more. Aaron Eckhart is a great actor in my opinion and he did a fine job in the role. I also enjoyed the ""steampunk"" qualities of the film. I am a Frankenstein fan.

6279416,1,B00IKM5LXG,"Lol, wth was this mess? It's scary to see a 3.5 star review on the average. It should be more like 1 star. When I see Frankenstein in the title I expect some kind of familiar story and a guy that's looks like he's a guy that's been put together from other dead guys. Not the case here. I still can't really tell you what the heck was going on in this film. We have ""The Monster"" burying doc Frankenstein in the beginning and then all hell breaks loose. Demons, gargoyles, vampires come out of the woodworks but all in a very weak and ridiculous story. It's like a 10 year old and his friends got together saying, ""Wow, wouldn't it be neat if Frankenstein fought gargoyle men!!"" And that's the mentality of the film. It works as a video game(think Diablo) but really blows here. I think one of the worst thing is Aaron Eckhart casting as Frankenstein monster, or Adam as they call him in the film. Very original name. Dude looks as much like Frankenstein as Godzilla does. And what's up with the heavy massacre around the eyes? Has to be the worst Frankenstein in film history.

It's simple fun that you've seen in a hundred movies and it follows a very predictable storyline.  There's really nothing wrong with that unless you actually pay attention and realize that key points are missing.

Spoiler time;

  For example,  why does Yvonne (Who is much more memorable as an actress than the character whose name I've already forgotten) decide to state that Frankenstein only takes care of himself before storming into the obligatory obvious trap?  You tell me!  I can see what should have led to that, but somehow all of the development leading up to it was left on an operating room table?
  Why does Queen Gargameth (Wouldn't that name be more memorable as well?)  change her opinion on Franky out of nowhere?  Who knows.",1420243200,,871,4.843537414965986

Eckhart is awesome, of course, the man could be brilliant in a Kmart commercial - but he is so wasted here... scars on the statue of David, paint splatters on the Mona Lisa, dung on Whistler's Grandmother.

Mary Shelley would either laugh or cry at the premise... this is really just Van Helsing with a better looking lead.

Just an afterthought - if you had two scientists who could produce the result you sought, one already demonstrating compliance and self-interest, and the other refusing to act based on principle - why would you kill the selfish, compliant one?",1420156800,,700,4.957264957264957

Adam, Dr. Frankenstein's creation, is found by gargoyles, the guardians of earth and the liaison between making and an archangel.  The queen of the gargoyles makes it known that Adam is to be saved at all costs.
Bill Nighy, in another one of his one dimensional performances, plays the main bad guy.  For whatever reason, Mr. Nighy has one mode of acting.  It matters not whether he plays a pirate, a demon or an ordinary person, it's the same thing.  Anyway... He has collected thousands and thousands of bodies in hopes of reanimation and eventual inhabitancy of other demons in the corpses.

I thought I  would like to watch this over and over as I enjoy the mixture of science-fiction, mythology, horror, theology, and action.  To enjoy a movie like this you have to surrender to the world of non-reality and embrace the supernatural.  For those fans of the Underworld series, you'll feel right at home in liking this movie too.  This motion picture allows us to experience the war between good and evil through the eyes and experiences of the anti-hero main character ""Adam.""  We, as viewers, witness his journey from that of an immortal cursed existence, soulless and abandoned in a corrupt world, where his life is filled with hate and fear of everyone around him, to that of purpose, structure, and righteousness. The movie has a Hollywood ending, but, based on thousands of other movies, we, the viewers, tend to enjoy these conclusions when escapism is our goal.  This is a good movie!  The time spent watching this movie is worth it!  The action is intense and the new version of an old classic, mixed in with new supernatural elements, makes for an entertaining couple-of-hours.

6279754,1,B00IKM5LXG,"I, Frankenstein is a movie by the creators of Underworld. The strange thing is that having enjoy Underworld a lot, I am between ""I hate it"" and ""I don't like it"" when it comes to this movie. It is not about the special effects, which are good. It is about the logic of the storyline. And here, do not get me wrong, I am pro-fantasy movies and like Science Fiction, vampire movies, etc. But this particular movie, I Frankenstein, does not make ANY sense.

For instance, there is a secret war being wage since centuries ago (yes, like in ""Underworld"") between demons and ...gargoyles?! (is not suppose to be between DEMONS and ANGELS?) Then, it is suppose to be a SECRET war and despite of that both sides clash on giant battles in a big European(?) city in the middle of the night and sometimes during day light at plain sight. Okay gentlemen, what happened to all those Asian tourists with their iPhones, iPads, camcorders, etc. So, there's a beautiful gothic cathedral and nobody notices huge gargoyles flying in attack formation while decapitating demons, and red lights going into the ground and blue ones going into the sky? Not a single civilian human being is anywhere nearby any of these places?

Now what about Frankenstein himself, he flees, then decides to go back, then he is on the run again, and then, he goes back and, so on, a few more times... And the gargoyles (second class angels) decide to spare Frankenstein life and then to kill him, and then to make him their ally, then to get rid of him, and so on a few more times.

In a nutshell, it seems like a cheap copy of Underworld (movie which I enjoyed very much). The arguments are weak, the storyline does not have any logic and has serious flaws, characters show a lot of indecision, I do not know where do gargoyles come from or what do they do fighting demons (for that case, it would have been just to same to have some of Dr. Who's races to be on a total frontal war against them). Do not waste your time on this movie. Nice special effects but lacks of common sense and logic.",1416614400,3,2052,4.452127659574468

6279820,3,B00IKM5LXG,"""I, Frankenstein"" is a well-made, fun popcorn flick.  For what it is, I can't fault it.  It's a fine, fun movie.

But that's also the problem, because it misses entirely the point of the material it is supposedly adapting to film.  I don't think Mary Shelley would be upset if she saw this film, but she would wonder why someone would make such a film ostensibly using her book as the ""source material"", because she would see so little of her work in the final product save for some superficial names and events.",1413936000,,512,4.473118279569892

6279906,1,B00IKM5LXG,"This is a remarkably incompetent film. For any film to be successful it must establish a plot and basic reason to care about anything. As near as I can tell this film didn't even try.

The film starts with a summary of the Frankenstein story. The book version for a change, which is nice. It starts with Adam (the monster's name now) burying his creator when he is attacked by demons. Why are they attacking him? How do they exist in the same universe as Adam? Who knows. Then he's rescued by gargoyles. Not the stone kind, but human-looking ones. Why do they rescue him? I dunno. Who are they and why are they trapped on Earth? Are they fallen angels or something else? I dunno. The film is astonishingly uninterested in such basic matters of world-building.

The woman in charge of the gargoyles takes pity on Adam and asks him to join them in their fight against the demons. Apparently there's a war that's been going on for eternity. So what are they fighting over? Why does Adam need to choose a side and join in? I get that the demons are probably bad because they have ugly faces, and in this kind of film that sort of surface appearance usually means someone's evil. Wait, aren't gargoyles supposed to be horrific and scary-looking? Frankenstein too for that matter? No wait, they're good so they all look sexy. It's as simple as that. But seriously, there is no hint of who these guys are or how they operate. Either of these sides.

So this woman gives Adam weapons and then he tears off, apparently training himself in a mountain-climbing fight montage. He accepts his place in this war with remarkable little question. He doesn't ask any of these very basic questions or even seem more than slightly surprised when these supernatural beings show up. Apparently he spent the next 200 years fighting demons. Why? He's not a very well-defined character. As played by Aaron Eckhart Adam is a one-emotion suppressed rage monster. Apparently he's better than anyone else in the world and has the ability to appear at will despite moving very slowly and obviously all the time.

You might argue that this secrecy is a mood-setting device. He is after all searching for answers. But not only are the questions poorly defined (something about Adam having no soul?) but there is no air of mystery. No cryptic and deep-sounding statements to make clear that we're not being told the whole story. Just a passive acceptance of whatever anyone says as fact before doing whatever the plot deems best. Even bad films will often have a few moments that made you laugh or caught your attention. Not this one. I spent most of my time confused and waiting through long and tedious explanations that didn't explain anything and just made me more mad.

The frustrating thing is that there are some pretty impressive things on display here. The graphics are pretty good and there are one or two impressive shots. And while he's far too pretty looking the Frankenstein makeup isn't too bad. It's mostly the way they choose shots to hide his obvious scars (which is the whole point of the character really) that gets me. A number of people clearly put a lot of work into making this film and I just don't get that. They clearly didn't put any effort in at the script stage. The entire film is just people monologuing self-importantly about issues that are at best unclear. Adam's plot is that he shows up somewhere and starts killing demons. Stir, rinse, and repeat about a dozen times. It's all he knows how to do. Then throw in Bill Nighy but don't give him any comprehensible lines or opportunity to charm the audience. Throw in a couple of cool character posters and serve cold.",1411257600,,3669,4.647149460708783

What really brought the overall enjoyment down to me were unexplained happenings, eg, in relation to him being able to be hurt in the flesh, where he needed urgent attention, yet he could do things that would definitely break bones and disable him, yet he didn't break any bones.

6279929,3,B00IKM5LXG,"The plot of I, Frankenstein picks up where Mary Shelleys 1818 Gothic novel ends. What has become of Dr. Victor Frankenstein's Creature after being seen in the Arctic Sea? Stuart Beatties Gothic action fantasy follows the story of the monster (Aaron Eckhart), who finds himself caught in the middle of the two factions  gargoyles and demons  as both sides try to recruit him.

Unfortunately, the Creature (now called Adam) is not interested. Neither are we, for the film has little to no story to speak of. Yvonne Strahovski appears as a scientist Terra, who, like Victor Frankenstein, is interested in re-animating dead bodies. Miranda Otto is the queen of the gargoyles keeping Dr. Frankenstein's journal. The screenplay does not explain much about what these characters really want to do. What does this Creature/Adam want to do anyway?

With Bill Nighy as a villain and Kevin Grevioux (co-creator of the Underworld franchise) as a co-writer of the story, I, Frankenstein sounds a bit too familiar to those who have seen the Underworld saga. The difference is that our new anti-hero is much more boring than Kate Beckinsales Selene and action sequences are more generic, despite the decent production designs and special effects.",1410566400,2,1231,5.109452736318408

6279980,3,B00IKM5LXG,"I first read Mary Shelley's Frankenstein when I was in the sixth grade.  I loved it.  Dr. Victor Frankenstein's nameless creation is such an interesting character.  Most horror movies are way too loosely based on the book for my taste, but yet I always watch them, hoping to see that beautiful character handled in a way that he deserves.  I had hoped this movie would be the one to meet my expectations.  Eh, well, it wasn't terrible.

In this story, the creature doesn't die as he did in the original book.  He lives on -- and on -- and on, apparently because the electrical shock that brought him to life caused some kind of change that left him -- for all practical purposes -- immortal.  Blessed by Dr. Frankenstein with super-human size and strength, he is a great warrior.  We have now reached a time in the near future when the demonic/angelic war against good and evil is coming to a head.  The dark forces prize the creature because he has no soul. This means he can be indwelt by the forces of evil and used to their advantage.  If you know anything about Biblical angels and demons, a lot of the actions of these characters doesn't make sense.  If you view them as purely fictional beings with no relationship to anything you've heard of before, and you completely suspend your disbelief, I guess these characters can work on that level.

The plot is interesting enough, and I did see glimpses of the internal conflict in the beast that I found consistent with the original Mary Shelley story.  As I said before, this movie wasn't terrible.  The angel and demon characters left a lot to be desired, but it was worth a Friday night diversion.",1409616000,3,1653,4.555932203389831

6279983,4,B00IKM5LXG,"A little too dark at times, but overall gives a different and interesting view of the character Frankenstein not seen before.",1409529600,,125,5.0
6279984,3,B00IKM5LXG,"Strengths:

1. I thought most of the actors were pretty decent in the flick for what they had to work with. Aaron Eckhart in particular brought good intensity to the role of Frankestein's creation.

2. There were a few creative ideas here that worked for me like the demon's goal for our main character.

3. They pay homage to Mary Shelley's work, by having the movie start in the 1790's with some elements of the original work. I found that kind of fun and clever.

4. Some of the action scenes are fun.

5. Its not another vampire vs werewolves story/movie which gives it a little freshness.

Weaknesses:

1. They had a really interesting idea here that they totally wasted. To give Adam (Frankenstein's creation) a purpose beyond his hate for his creator. Adam is a murderer, but does he feel guilt about his crimes? No. Is there an awakening or transformation from monster to humanity within Adam. The filmakers would like us to think so, but not really. You don't really gain a soul, by getting the hots for a chick. Does he struggle with his alienation from the world at large? A little maybe. One of the questions Star Trek always asked was; What does it mean to be human? They used characters like Data, Q and Seven of Nine specifically to look at that question. In this movie they didn't bother very much and took the easy way out. In a nutshell character development was lacking.

2. Lack of character development was not only lacking for the main character, but for most of the other characters as well like the lovely Yvonne Strahovski (from TVs CHUCK). Her role was underutilized and mostly confined to the smartest cheesecake in the film. The interesting Bill Nighy mostly reprises his evil persona from the Underworld movies, but there seems to be less enthusiasm for the role this time as there isn't very much time to develop his character.

3. As other reviewers have mentioned there is a passing resemblance to Underworld and shouldn't surprise as one of the creators of that franchise is behind this movie as well. This becomes a problem, at least to me but maybe not for others, because there is a ""sameness"" to these movies. While this movie is a little fresher by not having the same old vampire vs werewolf plot line its still all kind of similar and unfortunately more shallow. You still have two groups that have been fighting each other in secret for centuries with the odd character that doesn't fit in either world easily caught in the middle. The difference was that as a couple Selene and Corvin worked better as a couple in the original Undeworld and gave you someone to root for.

4. Visually I thought the original Underworld had more style to its look, this movie not so much. The CG gargoyles didn't look too hot and really a few sets didn't look to hot either and looked like ""sets"". For example, the opening graveyard scene felt like a set not a real place. Perhaps the budget was a little smaller for this movie.

5. Story wise a little more world building would have been nice, also a little more time taken with how Adam existed for 200 years and didn't go more crazy from just the isolation.

I think the paper thin story and weak character development could have been helped by a longer run time to address some of the weaknesses. The movie is 1 hour and 33 minutes. I think 8 of those minutes are the ending credits too. Really another 15 minutes of developing some of its ideas would have helped a lot. I think the original Underworld film was like 2 hours long, which gave them a little more time to flesh things out. All in all if you are a big fan of the Underworld movies you will probably like this one. If you thought those movies were ok-ish like I did then you will probably feel the same about this one. For me, it was ok for a rental and some mindless fun (I've seen much worse) but I would never buy it or watch it in a theater.",1409529600,5,3884,4.470338983050848

6280015,1,B00IKM5LXG,"""I, Frankenstein"" was a poorly made and badly titled movie.  It should have been called ""I, Crappenstein"".  Easlly the worse movie since Halle Berry's wondrous turn as Catwoman.  Maybe they'll make an even worse sequel called Frankenstein meets Catwoman.  The plot involved gargoyles v. demons, and Frankenstein's MONSTER was a kick-ass ninja back from the dead caught in the middle.  Bet you didn't know that gargoyles were the opposite of demons, did you?  Neither did I!  Even the special effects--surely the only excuse for a movie about gargoyles v demons--were pretty crappenstein.  The plot was definitely crappenstein.  As you can tell, I thought the whole movie was awful.  Truly terrible.  I mean really bad.  And not in a Michael Jackson bad-means-good kind of way.  Just bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad....bad.

I realize it's pointless to expect character development in a movie like this, but with Aaron Eckhardt and Bill Nighy I expected at least something like a character. And how on earth did they get those fine actors to sign onto something with a script that reads like musings of a bored teenager? There isn't an original idea or even a genuine hint of caring about craft anywhere to be seen.

But hes thrust into the middle of the war between good and evil, as a demon prince seeks to discover the secrets of Dr. Frankensteins science.

I, Frankenstein is a fun, action-packed adventure. It didn't get good reviews in the theater, but I was pleasantly entertained. Fans of the Underworld films should appreciate this science fiction/fantasy mash-up of gargoyles versus demons. Its mindless entertainment that is visually stunning with some great special effects. I thoroughly enjoyed the story  mystery, suspense, action, mythology, with a little drama and even a hint of romance.

Basically, it had too much hype to be considered a sleeper, the storyline wasn't good enough to consider it fine filmmaking, and the ride it took you on wasn't satisfying enough to consider it a popcorn blockbuster.  When I learned that it was supposed to tie into the Underworld mythology, I really had high hopes.  But there seems little chance of that happening now based on how poorly this movie did at the box office.  I would pass on this one unless you simply have to see Aaron Eckhart, who does his best here despite the material.

I noticed on Rotten Tomatoes that official critics reviews gave this less than a 5% positive rating, and I am just dumbfounded by these self important, smug and ultimately useless people whose job it is to review other peoples' films because they have done nothing of note in their own lives.  In any event, my rant aside, I, Frankenstein is an excellent little gem of a sci-fi, horror, and fantasy film which boasts a really interesting premise, and if I were to take a stab at it, I would say its a cross between Blade, Underworld and the biblical horror/monster films of old.

The cast is first rate, and the story is definitely very interesting, the effects first rate, and I found myself really enjoying it.  Lots of action, and moments of real human (and inhuman) emotion and tenderness.  Definitely a top shelf gem that I heartily recommend.

6280388,1,B00IKM5LXG,"God-awful waste of time. Going into this, I knew it was going to be a disaster, the trailers were ugly and uninteresting but I convinced myself that all films should be given an equal chance to prove its worthiness, so I watched this... I never wanted more in my life to leave. After about 14 minutes into this film I wanted to get up and run for my life, to prevent the risk of a heart attack watching this mess. The easiest titles to compare this to would be 'Underworld' and 'Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters'. 'Underworld' wasn't great but it was a modest film with some pure effort put into it. And 'Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters' sucked, it was unbelievably bad, but I loved it because it was fun. This film is neither modestly good or even fun to watch, it's just bad. My review of 'I, Frankenstein'.

'I, Frankenstein' tells the tale of Adam Frankenstein (Aaron Eckhart) who struggles to comp with his past as well as finding out how he is who he was. He is watched by a group of gargoyles who's leader (Miranda Otto) hides a secret book, which beholds the information on how Adam was created. But an evil business billionaire, Charles Wesexx (Bill Nighy) whose crew of demons discover that of Frankenstein's existence, seeks to capture Adam or his book of creation to reanimate his own army of monsters to fight against his enemy, the gargoyles, and take over the world. It's up to Adam and a scientist who seeks to reanimate substances to save the day along with the group of gargoyles.

How visually poor could a film be? Watching this I felt as if I was watching one of those weekly Sci-Fi films that premiere every Friday. Maybe if this film were released in late 80's or early 90's before Jurassic Park was invented these effects would have been accepted, but for a film released in 2014, after the release of King Kong and Avatar? This is unacceptable. The visuals are crude, ugly, and unconvincing to say the least. The amateur work of it almost made me exit the room where I was watching it after we get our first glimpses of those fire demon things (I don't even know, they were just so ugly and blah)

I have to talk about the mind aching editing and pace. The film goes by so fast, taking no time to sit and take a look at what it has, it just can't slow down, its dull action sequence after dull action sequence... and in the only second when the film isn't in an action sequence we get a highly awkward and un-necessary shirtless shot of our Frankenstein Monster. The endless action sequences are only made worse by the editing, with quick cuts all over the place to film the action; it's so hard to comprehend anything. There's no fun in any of it. The action is in such a large quantity, and poorly paste together form it comes out extremely dull and boring.

 This is a film only for a person who expects little to nothing from a film. The plot is so bland, so dull, so cheesy, so predictable that it's beyond laughable it's just sad. All the dialogue here is clunky and chunky and unbelievably stupid to say the LEAST. Not to mention the script includes an overabundance of action sequences (As I have already explained) and a high lack of character development. So in the end you care little for anybody, and you find it hard to become emotionally attached to Adam, who's only role in the film as the lead, is to fight and say 'I'm a monster'.

That is why I feel sorry for the talent who were completely wasted here. 'Aaron Eckhart' who did a pretty nice job was no match for his unbelievably soupy dialogue, and lack of time to develop his character beyond a few lines in between action shots. 'Bill Nighy' who can make any bad role good, is left nothing to work with and 'Miranda Otto'... well I just liked her in this, no matter how predictable her character was. But 'Yvonne Strahovski' for the scientist? Really? All she was, was some unconvincing, miss-casted, hotty, and that's it. She was probably only brought in to attract young male audience members.

All and all this is a complete disaster. The scripting is predictable; the visuals are worthy of a Sci-Fi channel film, and the action sequences lifeless and dull and leave no room for any character development. This wasted the present's of a mostly impressive cast aside from one completely un-necessary and horribly miscast 'Yvonne Strahovski'. F 5/23/14

P.S After a dismal run at the box office it's safe to say we won't see Frankenstein's monster anytime soon... oh wait! We have that one with Daniel Radcliffe out in October 2015...

'I, Frankenstein' is rated PG-13 for intense sequences of fantasy action and violence throughout. It's appropriate for teen's and up, maybe a little younger. But they'll be the only ones who might show any interest in this one, which right now is a strong contender for my worst films of 2014 number 1 spot.",1404691200,,4841,4.54243119266055

6280407,3,B00IKM5LXG,"Sometimes you see a movie and it seems that everyone got in a room, decided what sort of special effects they wanted to do, then attempted to build a story around it that would work.

This one sort of fits that bill.

Angels are those stoney gargoyles that you find on buildings everywhere...  Why?  what's the connection?  Why are they called the ""Gargoyle Clan""?!?

Never did figure that one out.

Villains, demons, didn't seem to have that sort of restriction or anything really similar.

Villains could be quite easily ""vanquished"" and sent back to hell by spiking them with any weapon that had a sort of crucifix symbol (not really a crucifix either, but I'm at a loss for the proper name for it.).  Find a plank, draw this thing on it, whack em up side the head *poof*

Now of course there's a battle for supremacy of the world, and God is of course keeping his hands out of it.  Why?  No idea, don't think they really tackled it all that well (though admittedly half way through it I was resorting to playing warcraft battlegrounds and just listening to this thing.).  Good guys are losing cuz their numbers are getting killed off and not replenished, whilst the bad
guys are either getting refreshed or were just more numerous than the good and better fighters.  That wasn't real clear either.

Oh yeah, Frankenstein?  Yeah, they called him that off and on, but we all know that his name is really ""The monster"", they dropped a lot of the surgical aspects of his scars in favor of making it look like he was clawed all over (closest description I can come up with),

He has a major attitude, because... well, he has no soul.  Of course, I'm a simple person, I would think that in their universe you'd have to have a soul to be animate, but nay, not so much.

Effects?  Glorious at some points, explosions, smiting, flying angels, buildings going up in flames, all sorts of fun looking stuff.

Plot?  (See above), that's about as coherent as it gets, can't say much more without giving up what little surprise there might be.

BUT, it's filled with lamely written stereotypes;

  o  Good guys want his help, but don't trust him (no soul)
  o  Good guys of course attempt to snatch him and make use of him.
  o  Betrayals abound
  o  Insert any other basic cliche you've seen in any number of fantasy films (Thought I had flipped channels and
  was watching Lord of the Rings with the High handed elves for a bit there.).

Nice color schemes, good architecture, goodly amount of people spearing other people, watch it for the effects and
don't expect much beyond that and you could have a decent time.

Spoilers

  With the silliness of simply writing / engraving  the cross thing on any object to turn it into a holy weapon, my mind
  started thinking....  Well, why not come up with a fragmentation grenade that was stuffed with a bunch of fletchettes
  you can fly, dive bomb, drop fletchettes, go out for a celebratory drink?

  Dunno

  And if a soul is a soul, how in the hell can someone grow a soul without some sort of intervention from God?

  I mean it's not like we're talking Wizard of Oz here (though admittedly some of the gargoyles did look like flying
  monkeys.).",1404604800,2,3187,4.5265017667844525

This was the perfect blend of the old and the new. This movie explains why Frankenstein did what he did and what he is searching for in life.

6280482,4,B00IKM5LXG,"I have learned of the basics of this movie through various recources, (I.E. Rotton Tomatoes, The Escapist, a plethora of viewer reviews and so on.) and they were part of the reason as to why it took me so long to give ""I, Frankenstein"" a try. To be honest, I have not read the graphic novel, nor did I know of its existence until I looked for information about the film.

It is because of my lack of knowledge for the novel that I feel as though I had a slate clean of personal bias (I am a bit of a Bibliophile) towards it being yet another movie based off of some popular source material. This, at least for this particular instance, is a good thing in my humble opinion.

Before I go on, I wish to state that when I take it upon myself to review anthything, I try to do so in an organised way, so, here is my review on in loosely formed checklist.

1) How was the opening of the movie, and was I interested in the main character(s) quickly.

  -Yes. The film opened with a good musical score, creative visuals, and a quick, yet not too short, exposition of the history of the ""monster"". It did not treat me as though I were an idiot that needed their hand held, yet gave me a short, quick to the point, introduction, just in case I was not familiar with the myth of Frankenstein's Monster. (Just because the original monster is well known within America, and Europe does not mean that the whole population of the world that may view the modern take would know of the myth itself. Simply assuming that every person, regardless of age, would know of this because it is so evident within the culture I grew up in is pretensious and narrow minded.

2) How was the music? Did every score add to the secenes and create some sort of connection to the proper emotion of said scenes well?
  -Yes. The soundtrack is wonderful. Each score added to every action sequence well, and none seemed to be out of place in any other scene. This speaks to the composer's skill as well as the attention to detail when the music flairs or luls depending on the scene the music has been married to. (I do admit, I want to buy the soundtrack. )

3) Was the movie profound? Did it make me think or inspire me?

  -No. Not really. In fact, I simply ""turned my brain off"". This movie isn't going to inspire poetic dissertations, or and sort of in depth thought. In fact, it's obvious that ""I, Frankenstein"" was not meant to be some sort of Earth Shattering socio political, religious, and so on, diatribe. It is an action movie. Sometimes it's just good to have a movie where one can ""shut down"" and relax. Action movies are wonderful therapy away from the tensions of our every day lives. It's like a vacation for the mind.

4) Was the movie visually appealing?

  -Yes! I adore the gothic and gritty visuals of this movie. It won't break any new ground in the world of cinematography, but no one stated that was the intent of the film. (Chuckles) Sure there were moments that felt as though the director was a fan of the ""Buffy the Vampire slayer"" series, and that is still not a bad thing. The scenery is gorgeous. The lighting not too dark and not so bright that one feels as though the entire time the film was attempting to blind the audience with lense flares. I appreciate this very much.

5) Did I have fun?
  -Yes. I did.

6) Will the movie stick with me?

  -Unfortunately, like with many an action flick of this nature, no. It is about as forgettable as many others of it's kind. Even still, not every movie needs to be an instant cult classic, or touched by the thumb of the film God(s).

7) Was I offended by anything in the movie?

  -Nope. There wasn't much substance to begin with, let alone the film being able to scrounge up some dialog or scene in which would offend me. Others? Perhaps. The world is full of people excitedly waiting with bated breath for something, anything, to come along so that they could be offended enough to validate a ranting, frothing, rage fest. (As we oft see on social media sites.)  This is the only time where I have felt that the lack of substance could very well be a positive factor for me to enjoy a film.

8) Are the characters easy to like, or find common ground with?

  -I'm not a scientist, or demon, gargoyle, nor am I some monster brought back to life by a crazed scientist from hundreds of years ago. (Laugh) Hell, the characters can be so steriotypical, or campy that I find it impossible to place myself in their position. If anything, i quite enjoy the accidental humor in how shallow the characters mannerisms and back grounds are.

9) Did the movie make me laugh, cry, or have any other ""deep"" emtion?

  -Oh yes. I laughed at ""Protect the Gargoyle queen!"" I had flashbacks to Disney's ""Gargoyles"". (Of which had so many characters that are far better written within the department of ""characters that are as deep as the ocean is blue"" category, as opposed to any character within ""I, Frankenstein.""

In summation, ""I, Frankenstein"" won't win any oscars with me, nor did it inspire me with any Mind exploding exposition upon the human pshychology of immortality and religion, but I will, and has, entertained me enough that I don't feel my time was wasted.

It's a vapid, pretty dance of action, fantasy, and flashy CG. (Also, far better than Transformers. Curse you Bay! Curse you and those horrible dog sex scenes! No movie should force an audience in the theater to watch dogs having sex for five minutes, let alone do it twice!) (Cough) That's another movie, but still, it set the bar low enough for me to enjoy ""I, Frankenstein.""

I found it entertaining. I liked the different take on the story and not just another remake of old Frankenstein movies. Definitely love the gargoyle/demon take.

The story itself isn't riveting but the action, special effects, and CGI were fun for me to watch. That's essentially how movies should be watched - it's what you enjoy, not what others think about it. I would watch this movie again.",1403913600,,464,4.716049382716049

Clearly it was written to pave the way for a sequel or two.

The plot was so silly and boring I found myself spacing out at points. I found the fact that the Frankenstein monster was an attractive man with relatively minimal scarring, considering he was made of various dead peoples' body parts lame.

I have trouble believing that if you go to the trouble of appointing guards to safeguard your leader, those guards would just leave in the middle of a battle, even if the leader tells them to go.  That would be the time you most need your guards, and even if the leader doesn't like it, the guards should know it and refuse to leave.

If you like horror/action flicks, are not looking for Oscar nominated performances, and can suspend your belief enough not to look to deeply for ""meaning"".  This one will do just fine.

6280556,3,B00IKM5LXG,"When you're watching a film where Frankenstein is a modern superhero ninja caught in a war between angelic gargoyles and hellish demons, then you're watching this movie. It's the only film devoted to this ridiculous concept. But considering it's the drunken brainfart from a roomful of studio execs who thought to reboot public-domain horror monsters by fusing them into a dark, gritty kung-fu film, well... It's actually not half-bad. It's like 40% bad.

Borrowing heavily from the ""Underworld"" films' plots and anesthetics, you'll know whether you should watch this movie or not based on your ability to swallow its absurd premise. I don't know how a thespian like Aaron Eckhart ended up being cast as the chiseled and dreamy ghoul who rips off spinning kicks and flying punches with ease, but that only adds to the movie's over-the-top insanity. Sometimes the film takes itself a bit too seriously though, with some long-winded exposition that make the experience drag. This could've claimed a 4th star as a fantastic 65-minute film.

This bizarre concept easily could've been an unwatchable mess, but Eckhart's unrelenting gravitas and some big-budget CGI make it mildly entertaining throughout. There are quite a few monster FX and wild, zooming action shots that make the film worth your time for the right fan.",1403136000,,1317,5.149532710280374

There are a couple Underworld stars that do appear in this film (Viktor and Rarz). They treat the monster kind of like Michael Corvin from Underworld. Overall I enjoyed it and will eventually purchase this film as it did not bore me. If only they would hurry up and release Underworld 5 so we can see Michael again.",1403136000,,587,4.485981308411215

1. Snarling! What is it with snarling that is so in vogue these days for film creatures of all stripes. And, why do they only snarl while running?
2. There must have been a film app for sale to studio special effects departments these past years where whatever dies (vampires, zombies, werewolves, demons, the possessed) turn into little bits of fiery ashes. At least in this film the little bits zoomed around a little before succumbing.
3. Been-done-before demon is now a corporate exec (Come on Hollywood, hasn't Wall Street had enough grief?) now using his resources for no good. Wouldn't a seaside mansion be more fun for the money?
4. The overly cliched attractive female scientist as love interest and eventual savior to our central character.
5. Studios over use the big cheap visual display monitors in a lab setting for effects purposes but are simply cheap cartoonish. And, the scientists' dialogue (well, the writers) consist of a random selection of science related, make-no-sense, phrases that when put together would make a half way intelligent middle school science student vomit.
6. Iconic battle scenes in, where else, a large abandoned warehouse. Very creative.
7. Frank and demons and gargoyles (while in human form) at times show super physical powers like super jumps and at other times run just like we do. Gargoyles fly like agile birds while still looking like they're made of concrete. At least be consistent!
8. Swords, spears in the 21st century. If iron or holy water is needed I'm sure any high school student could rig out a device to shoot particles/molecules of either substance at high velocity over great distances. Make the job a whole lot easier.",1402876800,3,1733,4.958762886597938

I can hear you grumbling it's a fantasy film, and yes it is, but even fantasy needs to make sense within it's own universe and this movie did not do that. I don't want to give away any part of the plot but if you have a choice between taking out one possible threat and the whole army of your enemy - you'd save the possible threat for later, right? Well, that is not the choice that was made in this film. Some of the acting was weak and there wasn't much in the way of character building.

6280648,5,B00IKM5LXG,"""You're only a monster if you behave like one.""
Structurally, the plot is a bit off.  When everything is considered, there's really not much there.  You have multiple bad guys in favor of disposing of Dr. Frankenstein's monster, newly dubbed Adam.  Everyone has ulterior motives.  There are many fight sequences in different locations, all amounting to the same thing.  There's a nave scientist who wants to create life from nothing, which would inadvertently help the demons in their agenda to take over the world.  Everyone wants Dr. Frankenstein's diary.  The consensus is no one wants a demon infested world.

The look of this film is fabulous.  The FX is outstanding.  The acting is uniformly fine (although at 64, Bill Nighy is a little long in the tooth to be playing these types of bad guys).  The action is plentiful, fast, and furious.  My only complaints are a rushed prologue (to rapidly fill us in as though this was part two in a series, without there ever being a part one), and the disturbing ambiguity of the Gargoyle Order which was every bit as blood thirsty and duplicitous as the demons.  You can't very well state that God is your employer while you're busy lying at every opportunity (the treacherous Leonore, gargoyle queen), and just generally acting the same as the hounds from hell.

I wouldn't mind if this became a series like Underworld but because of the disappointing reception at the box office and the critical response, it might not happen.

6280668,2,B00IKM5LXG,"The sets & weapons used in this were pretty interesting and well done. Costumes were fine, and the story...existed. But the thing that dropped the star count down was the dialogue. I even think the acting was ok, it was just sad that they actors had to try and make that dialogue believable. The thing that seemed to kill it was the need for over-explaining. Let's say Character A needs to explain what the gargoyles are doing, so they'd say something like ""We are defenders of light in the fight against evil"". Character B ""Ok, got it"". But then Character A goes on...""In the eternal struggle between good and evil we fight to keep the balance"". Character B ""Yup, makes total sense. Nothing is unclear about what you said."". Character A: ""I don't think you fully grasp what I'm saying, so let me just go on to say that we fight to uphold god's will and punish the deceivers (or whatever word for bad people) and send them to hell. Now hell is where demons live and where the punished are sentenced to spend eternity. We know all of this because there is a book, it's called the Bible, or the Holy Bible, and it expresses God's will..."" Character B: (Wishing he could swing a large blunt instrument at Character A) says something ingratiating like ""Let's get this done."" Then while walking away, Character A can be further heard reading the Wikipedia article about a demon...or archangel, or maybe one then the other.

So, if you have a problem enjoying movies due to lack of explanation and/or too much symbolism, then this movie is for you as you will get the meaning of everything while it is being explained to you ad infinitum!",1402358400,2,1632,4.5699658703071675
6280669,2,B00IKM5LXG,"I can say a few good things about ""I, Frankenstein"", but from a guy who loves movies and has seen more movies than most, at the core of this movie is an uninhabited void. In the same vain as movies like ""Underworld"" and ""Van Helsing"", that explains on the surface what you will get when you hit play on this bluray. In fact, they are so similar that when Bill Nighy's evil character Naberius came onto the screen, I assumed that he was a crossover from the ""Underworld"" series until after the movie was over I remembered that Nighy's character from ""Underworld"" was named Viktor. In this sense, you know what you're getting and it primarily has to do with monsters fighting monsters. The effects are outstanding and the 3D is off the charts. In fact, I found the 3D to be so good, despite not liking the movie, I am glad I purchased it.

The problem is, not unlike ""Underworld"" we are joining this movie in the middle of a war; somewhat. After the movie spends about 2 minutes slopping through the early events of Frankenstein's life and the culmination of his relationship with his creator, we are immediately thrown into some gargoyles fighting monsters on earth storyline.  The creators had about as much tact and setup as you would expect from people who could care less about the basics of making an audience care about your characters and just want to get to the videogamish chaos that they've become so incredibly good at.

They have become incredibly good at creating chaos, and beautiful CGI chaos it is. Unfortunately, finding action, sci-fi movie-makers who know how to develop personality as well as visuals is like finding a bugger in a desert. I don't think it's the fault of the actors involved in this movie. I think they are given material and they made the most of it. The problem is that every time there was a moment that could give us a little insight or care-at-all into our characters, they brush-stroked over it like they figured the audience didn't care about formalities.

Well, for the most part, we do care. Sure there are some out there who laugh goofily like beavis & butthead watching another music video but movies are remembered by the emotional connection that an audience makes with it. We made emotional connections to many action/sci-fi characters over the years.... RoboCop, John McClaine, Martin Riggs, Axel Foley, Luke Skywalker, Indiana Jones, etc. etc. etc.  That cannot be said about ""I, Frankenstein"" and the movie is already forgotten just months after being in theaters and weeks after releasing on home video.... and won't be remembered again.",1402358400,5,2590,4.772321428571429

6280671,3,B00IKM5LXG,"The elements and acting were there to really make this into a decent, perhaps top-notch film.  Urhm, within the genre.  Many of the pivot points simply weren't supported by what had happened in the film to that point.  The story isn't given any depth or sense of realism, the ideas presented were simply stated, not offered for imaginative investigation.  The characters weren't well established. and their motives were much as the ideas... more stated than opened to be explored.  Events were extremely predictable, and they really didn't have to be or in any way need to be.  It had great potential.  It is interesting, offers some new thoughts, it just could have been much better, easily.  It looks like they ran out of time, or money, and just took what they had and rolled it.  Or they really wanted to take an A movie and turn it into a B movie.  Not sure.

It is entertaining if you are into mixing modern conspiracy theories, theology, and old myths and lore.  I will probably buy it, since it doesn't seem too dumbed down with political correctness or otherwise interrupted by the fallacies of modernism.  Mostly.  A simple movie to watch from time to time.

Of course, there is a love interest between the Monster and one of the female protagonists, but this is a guy that has been a walking patched up corpse for the past few decades so I'm not seeing how this should even be a plot point. They play countless cliches throughout the movie as well. I *do* have to hand it to them for trying to break the angels vs daemons mold with gargoyles, but the writing and effects drowned out the very few saving points of this movie.
I give it 1/5 for being a drawn out, a overused story, having an unneeded and bad love interest plot, and poor special effects.",1402185600,,818,4.3881578947368425

Aaron Eckhardt was great as the tortured monster created by Dr. Frankenstein, still bitter and resentful.

But when he becomes the hunted of both good and evil, he must decide whether to run, or to fight back against both sides that seek his destruction. Along the way, he encounters a scientist who has discovered her benefactor has more in mind than he has let on. She is more caught up in the experiment of creating life from death than caring just how it will effect mankind. Until she meets the First and the one that holds the key to immortality.  I admit it could have been so much better, the storyline was there as were the characters, and lets face it, Eckhardt is an outstanding actor, whether he plays a tortured soul having lost the woman he loves, a post apocalyptic soldier with PTSD or as the creation of a mad scientist. He carries the film but that might not be enough for most critics, it was, however for me. If the director had more of a story to work with, or could better direct the other actors, it would have been a great movie. Or maybe a lot of the good parts wound up on the cutting room floor.

I, Frankenstein picks up where the graphic novel by Kevin Grevioux left off, after Frankys creator Victor is killed. The Gargoyle queen finds him, the demons are after him and all Franky wants to do is defend himself from the woes of modern day.

I suppose the film should get some points for shooting in Australia and for director-writer Stuart Beattie putting up with 11 (thats right, ELEVEN) producers. Had it not have been for the illusion of high production values and the fact that it will be popular amongst vampy teenagers looking for their next hit of comic book gore, this movie might have brought about the second death of ol Frankenstein. Not even the steamy Dont worry Ill stitch the monster up after battle scene with Franky and blonde bombshell Terra (Yvonne Strahovski) can save the gargoyles, special effects, and bad boy Bill Nighys excruciatingly awkward one liners.

This is a 'wait for prime' type movie--let me save you the coin now.  This movie can best be described as a morph of Batman (vigilante) + Blade (only special weapons can kill).  The money went into graphics...and capes. I am also disappointed that the closest thing to Mary Shelley's grotesque, monstrous Frankenstein was an actor that looks like Raiden  (Christopher Lambert) from the movie Mortal Kombat (1995).  The plot skipped too much and tried to cover such a broad area of time that it fragmented many potentially good scenes in the movie...for instance, over 200 years this guy ran around without a soul; the movie focuses on this many times over; suddenly everyone finds out at the end that he has a soul...and that meant a whopping nothing at then end....it didn't fix/change or amplify anything;  it actually ruined the importance placed on this fact in the movie. Also, these flying creatures are tearing up significant portions of what I think is London, fighting demons on streets and rooftops and flying in broad daylight and no humans are aware of this??...there are many small disconnects like this that cause me to 'eh' this movie.

The gargoyles in flight are ok from a distance however up close, well SNL would be proud.

The cast is acceptable but saddled with a script of actions and dialogue that gets progressively worse.

I think the filmmakers tried to create an ""Underworld"" type of film and lacked the talent or budget or both to come anywhere near.
The premise is as good as any in this video game/Gothic fantasy realm i think it could have been a better film had they invested their money into a good writer and scaled the effects back to what they could pull off correctly.  They didn't..

6280772,1,B00IKM5LXG,"The whole time I was watching I, Frankenstein, I kept envisioning poor Mary Shelley turning over in her grave seeing what had become of her classic creation. In this sequel set in modern times, the story is as stitched-together as the main character, what with Victor Frankensteins monster being recruited by a race of living gargoyles whose sole mission is to protect humanity from Satans army of demons. I kid you not. Meanwhile, a group of scientists is intent on using the 200-year-old creature to try and duplicate the old docs unprecedented achievement in human reanimation.

Director Stuart Beatties giggle-inducing screenplay - one wonders how the actors manage to keep a straight face while reciting the dopey dialogue - is just an excuse for a lot of incoherent action scenes, as hordes of animated statues and creatures straight from the pit of hell do battle with one another to no discernible point or purpose, while the filmmakers run amok with oodles and oodles of costly CGI. Theres nothing to engage the audience in either the story or the characters, which is a serious problem for any movie based on Frankenstein, since the main character, when played right, has the ability to evoke a deep pathos within the viewer, given all the maltreatment he endures at the hands of thoughtless, uncomprehending people. Popular misconceptions notwithstanding, Frankensteins monster is not really supposed to be this much of a stiff.

I choose not to blame the normally fine, and now impressively buffed-out Aaron Elkhart (unless that too is a product of CGI) for this failing but rather the material hes been given to work with here, but, either way, I seriously doubt that, in years to come,  the actor will be pointing to this as one of his prouder career moves. And that goes double for everybody else involved with this cinematic monstrosity.",1401494400,4,1853,4.970967741935484

6280810,4,B00IKM5LXG,"I don't know what everyone is complaining about....I, Frankenstein was extremely entertaining. The graphics were good. There was just enough of the original Frankenstein story to make it recognizable, but small twists to make it a little different. What I really enjoyed about the story was the introduction of gargoyles. During a tour in Europe, I was told that the gargoyles that I saw on various buildings were to ward off evil. Contrary to my previous understanding of what they meant (evil), I begin to embrace them and wondered why no one (besides the SyFy channel) has tackled the subject. The possibilities were endless. So, when I initially saw that this movie would include them, I was hooked and wanted to see it. Personally, I wasn't disappointed! I loved it. There was a brooding recreation (whose creator attempted to kill), evil demons, treacherous archangels, some good guys, some bad guys, son ""gray"" guys (not really good or bad), and tons of flying gargoyles (who were heroic and honorable). And for those who berate the graphics, I thought they were good. I mean... ok, we all know some CGI can be corny...and unrealistic, but what do you expect? How many gargoyles do you see change/morphs into a person on a daily basis. This is fantasy, pure fiction.... so the cornier the better.  And while I do agree with some reviewers that there were definite undertones of Underworld...in the setting and feel, that is ok, because I love that franchise too! And it probably doesn't help that Bill Nighy plays once again the bad/demon in this movie.  Regardless, I think I, Frankenstein was able to stand on its own. I give this movie 4 stars. Why? Because this was a solid play on the Shelley classic (a new twist on an old tale), there were some great fight scenes, a decent plot (retribution/redemption) and gargoyles.

However, I am completely thrilled with this movie.  It was true to the Frankenstein monsters origin, and it portrayed gargoyles as the sentinels they are.  (I hate when movies depict them as evil.)  I think it was a nice touch to include the Arch Angel, Michael, as their creator.

The makeup and visual effects were fantastic.  I especially like their simple but very effective approach to the gargoyles transformations.  Very cool.

I also appreciate that they made the Frankenstein monster more relatable.  Aaron gave a believable performance in his own transformation from the mindset of an angry, belligerent adolescent to the conviction of a human being with a soul.

Rewriting Frankenstein instead of creating a whole new character is the same as following the ""Zombie"" thing.

In ""I Frankenstein"" Frankenstein's monster isn't the ugly deformed creature that Boris Karloff portrayed in his version of Frankenstein but more of a man - physically and emotionally scarred because he was made from the corpses of eight men but a real person who has to wrestle with the questions: who am I and why was I created?

Frankenstein's creation dubbed ""Adam"" by the Gargoyles finds himself in the middle of the war between  Good and Evil and tries to avoid getting involved till he's forced into the battle and in doing so finds his purpose and yes redemption.

The plot had the Frankenstein monster returning after over a hundred years to find a war between gargoyles and demons.

I know it was supposed to be dark, but the lighting was just bad, I couldn't see anything. The dialogue was so bad and over-acted. It would be genius if it was a Troma or even Hammer movie. Am I missing something? Is it an homage or spoof or something Im not getting? The plot, although pretty simple was edited together so badly it was hard to follow, or maybe I just ceased to care.

6280944,1,B00IKM5LXG,"Nine Things about the Movie I, Frankenstein (USA, 2014)

1. One of the worst movies of 2014, this movie is really only useful to recalibrate your critical skills so you can better identify movies that are actually good.

2. The first 2 minutes of the movie summarizes the original story of Frankenstein, and picks up where the creature is mourning the loss of Dr. Frankenstein. So the title character of the movie is dead within about 120 seconds. But whatever.

3. While the creature is standing at the grave of his creator he is attacked by demons, who want to collect him. And it turns out that all those stone gargoyles on churches are actually alive. Their mission on Earth is to fight the demons. Somehow, the gargoyles see the attack on the creature, and come to his aid.

4. Nine minutes into the movie, the creature is brought before the Gargoyle Queen, who realizes that the creature doesnt have a name. So she names him Adam. At this point, the movie should probably be named I, Adam. But whatever.

5. The demon leader is played by Bill Nighy, who also plays the vampire leader in the Underworld series. The filmmakers don't even pretend that they aren't copying that formula.

6. The demons have been trying unsuccessfully for centuries to animate corpses, but even with all the modern technology they cant figure out how to do it. They desperately want Dr. Frankensteins scientific diary, since he reanimated a corpse simply with a tub of eels and a little lightning. They need the corpses so that demons from hell can possess them, since only bodies without souls can be possessed. Which completely invalidates all the other horror movies about possession and exorcism. But whatever.

7. At one point, the demons capture the Gargoyle Queen. This is bad for the gargoyles, because the Queen is the only one with a direct connection to Heaven. This seems to be pretty poor planning on Gods part. But whatever.

8. The special effects are not very impressive. The whole thing feels like a TV-movie. Its not remotely suspenseful. During a pivotal scene where Adam confronts the demon leader, I was so not riveted that I paused the movie to check my Facebook.

9. There is something wrong with almost every single scene in the movie. Its ridiculous. I actually think theres a drinking game in here somewhere. But whatever.",1400716800,2,2332,4.752475247524752

First, its too short: there is not enough  background on the story or time for character development. They went for briskly paced and wound up overshooting into rushed and sketchy. Second: its setting in an unnamed (and apparently mostly unpopulated) modern city was a mistake. It lacks any sense of place.

Many of the same actors were from the movie Underworld and played the vampires and the werewolves. If the plot sounds like the scenario of Underworld it should with the same writer and many of the same actors. I thought the film had a reasonable plot and storyline. There was a lot of action with great fight scenes. The movie was made with excellent animation and CGI graphic design. The battle scenes made the film for me. Unfortunately the acting was just average and it frankly detracted from the movie.

If you are looking for a good action film with very good CGI then this is a 4 star film. Just don't expect any Academy Awards. It is quick entertainment as the film is only 92 minutes long.

6280982,4,B00IKM5LXG,"I've admitted on more than one occasion that I am a horror film fan. True horror fans love nearly every horror film made, the bad as well as the good. Truth be told the majority of those films fall somewhere in the middle, never quite reaching classic status but rarely being so bad as to be putrid. So when you find one that sits in the middle but teeters toward the good side it's a joy. I, FRANKENSTEIN falls into that category.

The film opens with a retelling of the Frankenstein tale as told by the creature (Aaron Eckhart) to the point of his creator dying of cold at the North Pole. The creature returns his body to his homeland and buries him. Before leaving the graveyard he is attacked by demons. Saving the creature from their attack are the gargoyles. A nice twist on the concept of appearance is that the demons look like humans and the gargoyles are actually angles sent to protect mankind. They offer to protect him, going so far as to give him a name (Adam), but he turns them down, accepts the weapons they provide him and wanders the Earth for the next 200 years.

During that time Adam finds himself fighting off demons with greater frequency until he is finally drawn back to where it all began, where he was given a chance at redemption. Why is it the demons are searching for Adam? What is it they could want?

The story unfolds in bits and pieces, details of which I won't share here. Suffice to say that the lead demon (Bill Nighy) needs either Adam or the book written by Frankenstein himself which explains how he was able to re-animate the corpses he sewed together. It seems that Nighy is funding research on bringing back the dead for supposed scientific purposes. Face it; we all know this won't end well. The truth lies in the fact that Nighy is the lead demon and his real reasons won't be revealed early on.

You know from the earliest moments in the film that an eventual beat down between the demons and gargoyles will happen before the film ends. You also get the idea that Adam will be caught in the middle of it all and will be taking out as many demons as he possibly can during that battle. But will he and the gargoyles succeed or will the demons win this battle? And what is their ultimate reason for seeking to re-animate the dead?

All questions are answered by the end of the movie. It is the journey to that point that is enjoyable.  I've seen numerous reviews slam this movie as having the worst twist on the Frankenstein creature ever filmed but I have to disagree. With so many standard versions having been made it was nice to see a different direction taken for once. Most importantly with this twist is the discussion rarely held about the creature, the discussion of his having a soul or not. Does he or doesn't he? And if he doesn't is that something that can be changed?

In such wild roles you would think actors would come off as over the top, but that's not the case here. Each and every one makes their character believable, not and easy task with this material. To help them along an extreme use of CGI (computer generated images) are used to make both demons and gargoyles seem alive on screen.

Brought to you by the same people responsible for the UNDERWORLD series of films, this movie looks a lot like those with vampires and werewolves replaced by demons and gargoyles. It has that same blue tint to nearly the entire film and given that Nighy was in the earlier series there are moment you could see it as just another episode. But the change in creatures helps alter that a bit.

Is this the greatest thing since sliced bread? By all means no. But it does offer a brief entertainment that will have you rooting for the creature and enjoying some fantastic special effects. It's one I've thought I might continue to enjoy in the future. It all depends on your likes and dislikes. For me it was worth watching.",1400630400,,3877,4.441631504922644

6280985,1,B00IKM5LXG,"Seriously, this movie found the bottom of the entertainment barrel, broke it open, and then started to dig.  There was nothing good or redeeming about this picture.  The plot was ludicrous, the acting was atrocious, the action sequences were poorly executed, and the effects were only so-so (not nearly good enough to distract me from how bad that everything else was).  None of the characters really had a personality, the history of the gargoyles was laughable . . . seriously, this movie did nothing right.  It was as if they hadn't heard of test-screenings because there is no conceivable way that they put this nightmare in front of a representative audience and were told, ""Yeah, that was worthwhile"" by any real number of viewers.  I'd actually wondered for a while if Frankenstein would make a comeback considering the relative success of vampire, werewolf, and zombie flicks, but now I just wish that the monster had stayed dead.",1400630400,,938,4.949044585987261

It was going for dark and serious, and just ended up being overly dramatic. The lead actor, Aaron Eckhart, was excellent for the role, I just wish he had a better script to go along with that amazing physique. I think the story could have been fleshed out more with more history about why gargoyles were chosen as the protectors of mankind and such. I was quite confused as to why the gargoyles had a queen, and if they had both men and women, why was it they couldn't reproduce more of their kind. And the army the demons were building had been prepped for centuries, yet how did the demons have the technology to effectively cryogenically freeze the bodies so they wouldn't decay.

The acting is good as are the special effects, and it has a great atmosphere and sincerity for it's own world similar to the movie ""Van Helsing"" which is one of my favorites and has the Frankenstein monster in a major role in its story. ""Frankenstein Unbound"" is another example of a Frankenstein story that departs from all preconceived expectations. ""I, Frankenstein"" sits well and in good company with these two other movies and if you liked them you will like this one. Just as with ""Van Helsing"" and ""Frankenstein Unbound"" it's easy to swallow the far fetched, over the top, story and just go along with it, and thoroughly enjoy it.",1400544000,,755,4.8604651162790695

6281048,3,B00IKM5LXG,"Aaron Eckhardt is a good actor often playing roles that emphasize his rugged good looks and buff body. He shows in this film that he doesn't have to rely on his appearance to do well. His acting and the special effects are by far the best things about this movie. The script, as is mentioned in the featurette about the making of the film, is a patchwork of the ideas of several writers, and it shows. It opens as a sequel to the original novel, filling us in on what happened after Dr. Frankenstein pursues his ""monster"" into the Arctic, hoping to destroy him once and for all. So far so good. The ""monster"" has become quite articulate and can even read, but that's acceptable after 200 years of being on the loose (despite the fact that he's supposedly on his own during most of that time). It gets messy when two groups of non-humans, demons and gargoyles, begin battling each other for possession of the ""monster"" and/or Dr. Frankenstein's scientific diary. Bothe of these non-human species can and do take human form and fly (demons without visible wings) when they aren't battling. The demons are obviously evil, but what about the demons? Can the ""soulless monster"" really trust them and, if so, when they deceive him once, should he trust them a second time?

There are 2 scientists working for the demons, somehow unaware that they are helping the evil demons realize their plan to reanimate thousands of dead humans who, once dead, are soulless. Once they are reanimated, they, like the ""monster"" can be injected with evils demonic souls from hell. These dead humans with demon souls will then destroy the gargoyles and destroy and/or enslave the rest of mankind.

Eckhardt, as the ""monster"", has to deal with all this whether he likes it or not.

It's an enjoyable watch with lots of high-tech special effects, mostly CGI, so I'd advise fans of the original story to see this, but it's probably not worth watching more than once.  Kudos to Eckhardt for saving the film from being a disaster with only a few seconds of bare chest and scars webbing his face and body. Thanks for rescuing a film that would otherwise have drowned. Now we shall see if a sequel pops up.

6281098,4,B00IKM5LXG,"A plot using the fight between good vs. evil is nothing new but this movie offers a different twist using Gargoyles vs. Demons (respectively) to accomplish the story. The creative approach to deliver the plot earned star #1. Star #2 was awarded for the cool way the two factions were sent to heaven or hell. When a demon was killed by a holy weapon (typically wielded by a Gargoyle - or the Frankenstein Monster) the demon bursts into flame and its life force augers down through the earth to hell. It actually leaves a hole. Very Kewel. Alternatively when Gargoyles are killed their life force/soul is sent to heaven in a bolt of blue white light that grows in intensity and brightness as it rises through the clouds up to heaven. These two effects were very neat and I had not seen this before. Star #3 was given for the story that showed an ancient history of war between the two factions about which humans were totally unaware (like Muggles were in the H. Potter series). In addition the Frankenstein ""Monster"" is bigger than life (literally). He is fair minded immensley fast and powerful is over 200 year old and has no soul and takes the name Adam. He might prove to be the coolest movie character since Indiana Jones.  Star #3 was rounded out by the general entertainment value of this movie. Note: I acknowledge this movie is not for everyone. For example; those seeking knock your socks off special effects or super duper quality HD or overly bloody fights might be disappointed that and the fact there is not a single vampire in the whole thing earned my 4th star.

6281100,5,B00IKM5LXG,"My expectations set abysmally low going into this, I was actually shocked by how enjoyable 'I, Frankenstein' turned out to be. Perhaps not classic cinema, but better than average on all accounts, with fairly decent (if occasionally hokey) dialogue, an excellent cast of main characters, and commendable use of special effects.

Beginning with a very terse introduction to the final pages of Shelly's original novel, Frankenstein's monster, referred to as Adam in this production, is merely borrowed for plot purposes here, so do not expect this to be a faithful adaptation. It was never intended to be, and is only an extended epilogue, taking place in the present day; though there are some subtle parallels regarding the ethics of certain scientific endeavors, and how that related to Victor Frankenstein's experiments two hundred years previous. In the here and now, Adam is sought after by demonic forces who wish to use his body, with all its preternatural strength, for reasons that are probably a bit spoilery, so I will say only that since he is a re-animated corpse, the demons /and/ gargoyles alike have made assumptions about the nature of his life.

The gargoyles, it has been mentioned, seem a strange adversary for the demons - this is actually not the case. In medieval Europe, gargoyles were utilized as protectors of churches, as their countenances were thought to ward off evil spirits. This aspect I found refreshing, as while many of the demons were beautiful and alluring on the outside, goodness within was not always equated with an outer appeal. Kudos to the producers for that subtextual nugget of gold.

Aside from battling the demons, the gargoyles true mission is to defend mankind from the demons whose sole purpose is to destroy humanity. Neither are initially portrayed as allies to Adam - they are essentially both using him for their own ends because there is one aspect both gargoyles and demons have not accounted for.

I cannot agree there was no character growth in this movie. On the contrary, once Terra (a scientist unknowingly in the employ of Wessex, a.k.a. Naberius The Demon Prince) comes onto the scene, Adam's interactions with her eventually force his entire outlook upside down. Everyone has misjudged Adam, but none more than he has himself. The final revelation played heavily upon the overall theme, that is to say, that ""all life is sacred"", which is the reason I suspect so many reviewers are having conniptions over this movie. Based on its own merits, and not of other franchises, which it bore no resemblance to, this was a good, solid film in the vein of old school good vs. evil movies.",1400371200,3,2644,4.948198198198198

6281110,1,B00IKM5LXG,"Oh, my.  I watched this with very low expectations, of course, but I enjoy the Underworld franchise as far as it goes, so I thought this spiritual cousin might provide a modest dose of entertainment.  This, however, is an astonishing failure on every level.  It is hard to know where to start while criticizing it because there is so much wrong here.  Lasting around 90 minutes, the entire film, which places the title Swiss doctor's itinerant creation in the center of a centuries-old war between gargoyles and demons, plays as a frantic trailer for itself.  Explanations are condensed or disregarded entirely.  Characters leap into action without justification or motivation.  There is not a single pause in the name of atmosphere nor character development nor even a basic level of coherency.  There are deadly earnest lines such as, ""I am a demon prince, and you will kneel before me!"" and ""I, descender of the demon horde.  I, my father's son.  I, FRANKENSTEIN.""

It is downright sad, cringe-worthy even, to remember how great Aaron Eckhart is in, among other films, In the Company of Men, The Dark Knight, and Rabbit Hole and then to see him here as he growls, grunts, flexes his stitched-together muscles, resembles the aging singer of a bar-circuit Alice Cooper tribute band, and otherwise refuses to emote.  As for the aforementioned action sequences, do not expect them to be the sole redeeming quality:  staged in warehouses or on the urban-generic streets of a city with no visible human population, they become monotonous in the worst way, a bland cycle of of smashed concrete and digital demon fireballs without notable choreography or even a hint of tension.",1400284800,,1673,4.974820143884892

The journels of his creator Dr. Victor Frankenstein are sought by evil demons as the last key ingredient to reanimate thousands of human corpses for the purpose of the destruction of mankind.  Gargoyles(kind of lower end angels) though outnumbered must stop the demons.  The Gargoyle queen does her best to protect the Monster from being captured by the demons but in the end he is a formidable recruit to fight them.  This is mainly a CGI fantasy and a payday for Eckhart, who to his credit plays the Monster roll with conviction.  Filming techniques are comparable to all the recent vampire/werewolf movies and TV shows.  So the whole family can watch as the gore is of the cartoonish kind.",1400284800,,854,4.7687074829931975

6281124,4,B00IKM5LXG,"I was startled at first by how much it is like the 'Underworld' universe. I shouldn't have been I suppose. It's connection with 'Underworld' is right there on the package. And of course it uses so many of the same actors in so many of the same sort of roles. The lighting and photography are obviously from the same hands too.

But on just a little further consideration this Frankenstein seems to be more like 'Blade' in white face.

In the Blade universe you have the humans - who are more or less just spectators because they lack enhanced powers. In 'I, Frankenstein' the same. In Blade the vampires when stabbed suddenly combust - same in Frankenstein. In Blade there are contending groups of vampires but Blade belongs to no faction - he is unique. This too is the same in Frankenstein.

So on the whole this is very familiar territory. It is not, of course, anything like the Frankenstein story. The true Frankenstein story is just a brief set up at the beginning to explain why Aaron Eckhart has all those facial scars. Otherwise we might think he was just a graduate of some German University like Heidelberg.

There is nothing very Frankenstinian about Eckhart. The Monster in the book is physically much larger as I remember. Most of the actors who played the monster were big men until little Robert De Nero took on the part. But  Wesley Snipes is a little guy so it doesn't matter. This Frankenstein isn't the lumbering shuffling monster we remember  by Karloff . This guy is the muscular and agile Blade character except white.

It doesn't pay to think too hard about movies like this. The message is not in some lesson about the existential nature of man and the dangers of science. The message is - 'Flash' 'Bam!' .

In this version, 'Adam' is searching for his identity. He has no idea as to the eternal war that is being fought and wishes not to be involved. However, he finds himself protecting a beautiful (of course) scientist. What I find to be an interesting twist is that the demons, like vampires, when killed, burst into flame. It is worth the time if you are a fan of this genre.

6281174,3,B00IKM5LXG,"Before renting this movie, I had two negative impressions. The first from the Amazon reviews. The second being that Aaron Eckhart in this type of role was not a good choice.

If you like this type genre, this movie is ok. It kept my attention from beginning to end. The storyline did not come across as rehashed and had some interesting new twists. The special effects were very good. The fight scenes were well done and two fight scenes were excellent. Everything comes to a nice ending and I was not left with an impression anything was incomplete.

Now to Aaron Eckhart. He did a lot better than I anticipated but he just didn't seem 'right' in this role. My biggest gripe with his acting was the constant scowl on his face and his anger mode. It looked forced and out of place. Unfortunately both the facial expressions and his odd anger preoccupied my attention more than it should have. It was just a bit over the top. However, it was not to the point that I did not enjoy the movie.

No bad words, no nekkid people. Lots of violence and death scenes but no extreme blood and gore. Most deaths were demons bursting into flames or the good guys dying by ascending into a light.

Overall, worth the rental if you can't find anything else to watch. I enjoyed the movie much more than I thought I would. I never considered stopping it nor did I feel regret about renting it.

6281180,5,B00IKM5LXG,"It's about time an interesting/entertaining/action based movie was made that shows respect for certain basic aspects of religion and gives its due to some of the the past foundation traditions that modern civilization was built upon. (Sadly in  so many areas of contemporary culture there has been an attempt to minimize the importance of religious ethics, sometimes in a very biased ignorant way).

 I can already see the virulently ant-religious critics, skeptics, cynics sharpening their knives to criticize this film. How dare they mention ""God"", ""angels"", ""demons"", etc.!!  These are not politically correct!! Sadly, many enemies of religion/films with strong ethical humanistic themes  have little to no knowledge of religion,(also theology, history). , and its major contributions to civilization. However, as a person of faith I believe that well  made movies that point to higher purposes (i.e. God), morals/ethics are in short supply. It's really good to see even Hollywood now coming out with mainstream movies (e.g. Noah & Son of God).

This movie was exciting, creative, entertaining with solid acting and a solid script. The special effects were pretty good but that was not the overall theme of this movie. This was not just another horror/fantasy movie. This was a ""good vs evil"" film but that didn't turn it into a cliche. There are deeper levels here. I love the use of Christian imagery to include scapulars, sacramentals, gargoyles, angels and demons and of course the central ideas of God, the soul and redemption. Although a lot of these are from Catholic theology they also have a broader appeal to all Christianity, an audience that has been very badly ignored/dismissed by modern secularists and their ilk. I may be in the minority but I am really sick and tired of the domination of ever increasing senseless uses of sex and violence for so many films. Humanistic themes/values have really fallen on hard times.

My wife and I loved this film and hope that it generates enough revenues/interest to lead to a sequel.

6281247,3,B00IKM5LXG,"In a different twist on the Frankenstein story, Frankenstein's creature finds himself caught in a centuries old war between demons and gargoyles.

After watching this, I wasn't sure what to think exactly about this story.  I mean I don't mind a different twist on classics or on historic people or subjects (such as Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter) with some being more successful and original than others.  And therein lies the rub with this movie, I was entertained for sure as there was plenty of action but for originality of story is where the movie falls short.  I really felt like I was watching an Underworld sequel with a mix of Van Helsing thrown in.  They even go so far as to cast  Bill Nighy (Victor in Underworld) as the demon villain who essentially plays the same character (demon/vampire).  Anyone else recognize the actor who played a werewolf in Underworld also cast as one of the Naberius' guardian demons.  I don't mind using good character actors in the role as this guys are for sure but the story line was so similar, I really expected Kate Beckinsale to come flying in and save the day.  Oh wait, they did, but just made it a male actor and called him Adam.

Bad movie, no, as I said, I was entertained and thought it was ok in the end, but in no way an original story and to me just really didn't make a good Frankenstein story.

If you like the Underworld or Van Helsing type stories (although you might prefer to just go watch those as the Underworld series I think is much better), then you might like this as well, but if you are looking for a new original story with a unique twist that adds to the Frankenstein legend, then you might be disappointed here.",1399939200,4,1686,4.495081967213115

It is up to Adam to put an end to the war. I have to admit that going in to this I was not excited at all. The trailer wasn't that exciting to me and I was expecting it to be so cheesy that it would be unwatchable. I'm not sure if it was my expectations or not but I ended up really liking this. The best part of the movie was this it didn't try to be anything it wasn't There was a few minutes of story but it really was just one long battle sequence. That made it exciting. Even though it's PG-13 it's nothing like the Legend Of Hercules PG-13. Hercules was hurt because it didn't show any blood and the fighting looked more intense then it showed. This movie, while no blood, every time a demon died a line of flame came out which made it seem like something was happening. Overall, much better and more exciting then I was expecting. Nothing more then a long fight scene but it was exciting and fun to watch. Also one of the better 3D movies I have seen, some very neat effects.

6281305,5,B00IKM5LXG,"When I first saw the trailer for this film, my heart raced and a wicked smile crossed my face.  The fight scenes and the Gothic imagery really amped me up for some reason.  Maybe its because I love unique takes on existing mythologies.  But regardless of why, I knew I had to see this film!  And thankfully, the fine folks at Lionsgate saw fit to grant my request.  I, FRANKENSTEIN is an adrenaline-charged reimagining of Mary Shelleys classic horror story and one heck of a ride!

I didn't realize this film was based on a graphic novel until after I watched it.  But what makes this piece of information impressive is that Kevin Grevioux, who portrays Dekar in the film AND who wrote the screenplay, actually wrote the graphic novel as well!  This guy is a major powerhouse!!  I loved the UNDERWORLD series, which he also wrote and starred in, so this is just one more feather in his cap.

I, FRANKENSTEIN is shot well and looks amazing onscreen.  Do yourself a favor and watch this in 3D; you will not be disappointed.  The lighting and imagery make the movie burst from the screen in 3D, and the result is a visual feast for the eyes.  The look of the movie is half of what makes it so good.

But the story is the other half.  Ive said before that I love unique twists on existing tales, and this is definitely one of those to love.  Grevioux weaves several new elements into the Frankenstein mythos and gives us so much more to love.  I particularly like the Gargoyles and how he makes them guardians commissioned by the Archangel Gabriel.  This is a wildly fascinating concept and shows the massive depths of the mans imagination.

There are many folks out there that will not enjoy I, FRANKENSTEIN, simply because it is way outside the normal parameters of entertainment.  Although it had a wide theatrical release, it is not a mainstream film.  But if you loved titles like UNDERWORLD, then this one is right up your alley.

I, FRANKENSTEIN is a major win for me, and I suggest giving it a look.  Filled with impressive visuals and original concepts, this film has many different aspects for appeal and should attract a wide variety of genre-lovers.  Make sure you watch it on Blu-ray at least, though, so you can truly enjoy the effects.  The film hits store shelves next week, so make a note.",1399248000,137,2302,4.542579075425791

Flavors of the Underworld film series abound, with ""Adam"" getting caught up in a centuries long war between the Gargoyles (human protectors) and the Demons (Lucifers bad boys). I found ""Adam"" to be too svelte and boring as the ""monster."" Since when does Frankenstein's beast look like a male model with a few scars on his face and chest.

6281324,3,B00IKM5LXG,"The gargoyles look incredible, but they transform into wimpy humans all the time.  The writers seem to think we need to see humans when the gargoyles speak.  Really distracting.  Also, they are essentially angels that can transform into living statues.  Why should we care?  The writers gave us nothing to make these creatures novel.  Just lazy.

The demons are nothing special either.  In fact they really look like every vampire you've ever seen in movies.  They even die EXACTLY like the vampires in the Blade series!  Again, lazy.  They actually have to run everywhere.  Even vampires have powers.

Frankenstein's monster--acted perfectly by Aaron Eckhart--is not as believable or imposing because of the same type of failure in make-up/costumes/effects.  Eckhart acts and moves as if he is a hideous and tortured being, but his look is just not intimidating.  His body is not a stitched together series of parts, but a good looking fit man with consistent skin tone (tanned) and some stitching scars.  His face is not disproportionate.  No big chin.  No weird head. NOTHING to remind us that this thing is not human.  You could put him on GQ in full movie make-up.  Lazy.

The story is mildly interesting, but the laziness of this production comes through again.  The story is not developed to its true potential.  It's as if someone had a great starting idea and everybody just threw their hands up and cheered--we have a story!  No . . . No . . . read a book once in a while, Hollywood.  Every character, every group, every facet of the story is UNDEVELOPED.

So, what is good about this movie?  When the gargoyles are gargoyles they are amazing and have some fun fight scenes.  The acting is excellent.  I mean, what a wasted cast!  You could really see Eckhart trying to BE Frankenstein's monster, but without proper effects or make-up, it just seems silly sometimes.

Wasted cast.  Lazy effects and make-up.  Lazy writers.  DO NOT BUY.  ONLY watch this if you are a monster maniac.",1399161600,,1991,4.789940828402367

6281331,3,B00IKM5LXG,"When I saw previews of this movie, I thought, ""Underworld"" all over again. I thought the Frankenstein twist might be interesting however. Turns out, it wasn't. Not because Frankenstein's creature isn't an interesting character, but because in this movie, he's a cardboard cut-out. Well, so is everyone else as well. Plenty of people have commented on being confused about what this movie has to do with Frankenstein, the story, and their confusion is understandable. Frankenstein is a gimmick here, not a real character.

That's the problem with basing movies on graphic novels. What works in them, doesn't always translate well to film unless you've got a really cracker-jack screen writing team. Without them, the broad strokes and oversimplifications and stereotypes common to a graphic novel just look silly. And so it does throughout this film.

Aaron Eckhart actually does a good job playing ""Adam"" Frankenstein, the monster of the legendary story. But the writers gave him none of the depth, personality or humanity that Shelly did in the original novel. Instead he has one dimension -  being pissed off for being alive. Yeah, even scarred up he looks like a super model (so why does everyone reject him?) and could probably be a really nice guy if anyone treated him decently. People complain that Eckhart didn't do a good job with the character. I thought he did fine, considering there was almost NO character to deal with anyway! His Adam is just plain old pissed off. Never manages to get much beyond that.

In the beginning of the film we can't even see WHY he is pissed. It is so vague what happens. Apparently, ""Daddy"" Frankenstein tries to kill him by tossing him off a bridge or something, and he retaliates by killing Daddy's new bride, and then Daddy chases him all over the place until he (Daddy) freezes to death. Yeah, this stuff was KIND of in the Shelly story, but that was an ENTIRE NOVEL, not a 5 minute synopsis. At this point, we leave the original story far behind for something much more cliche and less grand. No wonder the audience was confused!

So Adam takes Daddy's body back home and buries it, and things are only going to get worse. Apparently, he is a source of great interest to a demon horde hoping to raise the dead so other demons can possess the bodies. Okay, fair enough, he's a type of precious resource, even if it's for the ""bad"" guys.

But, then enter ""good guys"", a bunch of gargoyles/angels who apparently have one purpose -- wait for it -- to stop the demon horde from taking over the earth by possessing reanimated corpses. So, they too have an interest in Adam, if only to keep him out of the hands of the demons.

This presents another confusion. Why neither of these two groups did anything with Victor Frankenstein (""Daddy"") while he was alive and could be of use to them is anybody's guess, except maybe cardboard characters really can't think in more than one dimension. Sigh, well to continue...

What follows is the usual absurdity, similar to the first of the Underworld series. Adam is caught between the warring factions and must fight for his own survival. Of course, to do that he gets tossed between the factions and treated pretty much like a thing (the whole argument in the original novel is that he has HUMAN feelings and passions and deserves to be treated with kindness and compassion) driving home the point that he will never find acceptance, not on earth, nor in heaven, nor in hell. He is the ultimate loner.

The angelic gargoyles treat him like a criminal (way to go, good guys, don't bother to right an injustice given the chance, just aggravate it!), the demons simply want to capture and exploit him. Quite frankly, for the first 3/4 of the film, I was on the side of going with the demons because they might at least give him a decent meal!

Humanity on the other hand is totally ignorant and absent in all the conflict and proceedings. I guess humans have no say in the matter, and have just been dismissed (except for the vague references that the demons want to rule humans - why I cannot possibly imagine) and the angels don't want them to succeed.

So basically we have conflict for conflict's sake, and because it makes a good excuse for some spiffy CGI effects. There are a couple of humans, scientists, who appear in the film, but they are just tools to help the demon prince revivify his army of corpses. This, of course, fails in the grand style that Dracula's children fail in Van Helsing.

The problems with this film are:

One dimensional characters who do not really develop over time.

Pointless and uninteresting dialog.

Confusion of good vs evil. If you're going to have this going for you, the good ought to DO good, and the evil ought to DO evil. Just saying they represent one or the other, while beating the crap out of each other, is morally bankrupt.

Lack of a reason to care. We can almost care about Adam Frankenstein. He gets treated like garbage by everyone in the film, except for the female scientist (Yvonne Strahovski) Terra Wade, who is also one dimensional, but shows a slight amount of compassion for Adam when he is wounded in a fight. We almost care about her because of this, but she never develops.

They brought in some powerful actors for this movie, including Bill Nighy as the demon prince. He walks through the part because, he has no real part to perform.

In the end, it seems like this movie has less depth than a TV commercial, in fact, there are TV commercials that are far more interesting.",1398556800,8,5524,4.65400410677618

About as far from Boris Karloff or even Robert De Niro for that matter, as you could could possibly imagine, enter Aaron Eckhart as the brooding eponymous here/antihero
In a world built on the comic strip and with more than a large resemblance to the successful Underworld movies, we find (yet again) that a war has been raging between Gargolyes and Demons for centuries that could threaten the survival of the human race. At that point you could have substituted Lycans and Vampires, without having to change the script much.
Adam nee Frankenstein (or his monster however you want to view it) is the missing link between soulless reanimation and demon re-population of Earth. Standing in the way of chief demon prince (Bill Nighy chewing scenery as he goes) are the Gargoyles, a religious order of shape shifting flying super warriors who ""ascend"" when killed, as their nemesis demons ""descend"" in a fiery ball during all the fight scenes.
It's OK, but ridiculous really, filmed in Europe (like the Underworld movies) where everyone speaks English, and where a technologically advanced human race is somehow oblivious to flying gargoyles, demon destruction and immense buildings and cathedrals seemingly always vacant, it's a lot to accept, even suspending disbelief to the maximum.
Eckhart swaggers around with a ripped physique and crooked hard stare most of the time, delivering monotone sound bytes, usually followed by slow mo swaggering with fire balls behind him.

6281339,2,B00IKM5LXG,"Even though most of them flop, Hollywood just seems determined to cram the glossy, witless supernatural thrillers down our throats. Consider: ""Legion,"" ""Constantine,"" ""Van Helsing"" and everything ""Underworld.""

And at times, ""I, Frankenstein"" seems like a massive crossover fanfiction of all those -- we have demons, angels, an ancient feud between warring immortal factions, a conspiracy to bring the undead to life... and gargoyles. It feels like a post-""Underworld"" fanfic based on Mary Shelley -- cheesy, plodding and derivative, but it's also oddly harmless.

After burying his maker, the Frankenstein monster (Aaron Eckhart) is immediately caught in a clash between demons and the angelically-assisted gargoyles. The gargoyle queen Leonore (Miranda Otto) declares that his name is Adam, and asks him to help them save the human race from demons. He refuses, but grabs a sanctified weapon and starts sending the demons back to hell.

Fast-forward to the modern day. Adam is still hunting for the demon prince Naberius (Bill Nighy), who has begun scientific experiments to recreate Frankenstein's revivification techniques -- and is hunting for the monster and/or Frankenstein's notes. With one of those, he can unleash a new horde of demons on earth, which the dwindling gargoyle forces cannot hold back.

""I Frankenstein"" feels like a massive crossover fanfic. The style is very much ""Underworld,"" the main plot and villain motivation are from ""Van Helsing,"" and the angel/demon thing somewhat reeks of ""Legion."" And of course, the Frankenstein monster is a tortured, angsty soul with abs that you can grate cheese on, who is redeemed for love of a bland scientist he just met.

There is a certain charm in the movie's clear admiration for the original Mary Shelley novel, though. There are many nods (Adam's name) and references to the book, rather than to the more famous monster movies loosely adapted from it.

However, ""I, Frankenstein"" is still a mess. The wafer-thin plot manages to be both simplistic and overcomplicated, with no twists or hidden layers. So it loads itself down with glossy slow-motion action sequences and flashy CGI (both gargoyles and demons expire in massive eruptions of light). The dialogue tends to be cheesy at best (""Now all I see is darkness."" ""I am not human, nor gargoyle, nor demon""), and whenever the action dies down, the story lapses into a plodding, awkward pace.

Aaron Eckhart seems to be showing us how he would have played a Christopher Nolan Batman -- lots of brooding and angsting (sometimes on rooftops), and talking in a gravelly monotone. He's not giving it his all, but he's putting more effort into it than the sleepwalking Nighty. Yvonne Strahovski is so blandly generic as a contrived love interest, she might as well be made of compressed Wonder Bread.

Honestly, the only actor who seems to be really throwing herself into her roles is Miranda Otto, who puts a lot of trembling passion into her cheesy dialogue. God bless Otto, she's working hard on this, and she does add some moments of much-needed subtlety.

""I, Frankenstein"" is a pretty bad movie that derived almost everything from other movies, but it does have a little sliver of heart that makes it hard to hate. It's not offensively bad... but it is bad.",1391904000,7,3277,5.0762081784386615

Although Aaron Eckhart isn't as adorable in tight leather as Kate Beckinsale, in my humble opinion.

But all fans of the Underworld films, or at least fans of the first movie in the series, should definitely enjoy this.  I, Frankenstein takes the premise of the Mary Shelley book then wildly develops into its own mythos to include Frankenstein's monster helping warriors from heaven (in the form of gargoyles) hunting down demons.  It sounds strange at first, and admittedly doesn't get less strange when it's revealed what in the world Frankenstein's monster has to do with any of this, but it's at least buyable for what this movie is trying to accomplish.

Also like Underworld, the movie features tons of great action scenes and takes itself way too seriously for the type of film it is, but I think I prefer it that way compared to something like Van Helsing, where there were far too many cheesy one-liners for its own good.  Moreover, Bill Nighy plays the villain in this, and he's gloriously over the top in his wickedness, and it's awesome.

The look of I, Frankenstein is the best part of the movie.  The settings are very gothic and give off a great atmosphere.  The CGI looks cartoony in spots, but mostly looks great.  The gargoyles look amazing, but the demons...are a little goofy.  At least two of the female actresses are easy on the eyes in this movie and Aaron Eckhart and Jai Courtney will give the ladies something to gawk at too.

You know, the kind from ""down there."" Stripping both sides of any real religious significance didn't free the scriptwriters as much as it just set them adrift. Throw in a modern scientist trying to recreate Frankenstein's work - well, the modern version of ""More power, Igor!"" used actual units of measurement, even if they couldn't tell energy from power. (For any English majors out there, energy and power are as different as miles and miles-per-hour.)

They want Frankenstein who she now names Adam (Aaron Eckhart) because that sounded significant to the script writers who haven't had a brilliant idea yet.

The film moves to the current age (pun intended) where Mr. Wessox (Bill Nighy again- wink wink nudge nudge) leads a group of re-animaters (Yvonne Strahovski).

6281346,4,B00IKM5LXG,"Disclaimer: I write this review on nearly two and a half days without sleep and functioning on two cups of black tea.

  I just watched I, Frankenstein and in all honesty... It's not bad.

  First let's start with The Creature, Frankenstein's Monster, Adam.  The scarring and hair was better in the 1790s flashbacks.  Why the Hell did they change that?  He looked more like the literary version in those scenes.  There was even the nice touch of dark rings under his eyes.  They should have kept him like that, maybe a little paler.  And for God's sake don't give him ""sexy abs.""  His physical strength should be surprising, not obvious.  Also they should have done some cheap trick photography to make him taller. They were able to make Luke Goss look eight feet tall in the Hallmark mini-series inexpensively so why does he look roughly ordinary human height here?  He should have been kept abnormally tall.  Focus on the height, not the muscles.  Slender, corpse-like would have been fine.

  Adam's personality is pretty true to the book.  He's bitter at the world.  Longs to be human even though he tries to hide it because he thinks it's impossible. He's lonely and angsty and this is just right for the character.  It's cliche now but The Frankenstein Monster was always this way.  He can't help it.  It's in his nature.  And he clearly feels guilt for what he had done to Victor and Elizabeth. In the novel he was also accountable for the deaths of Victor's younger brother, William, Justine (whom he framed for William's murder), Henry Clerval, Elizabeth, Victor's father (as he died of a broken heart) and then Victor himself.  And he regretted all of this and longed to atone for his acts of vengeance.  He was very remorseful.

  Adam is broody and tragic and speaks well, not that annoying slow stroke-like speech they give him in the 1994 film and the Danny Boyle play.

  He also had the full head of hair at the moment of his creation like in the novel.  Pause here to think about how ridiculous the concept of the flat head truly is over all, how someone could creact life but not a decent skull cap.  This is also why I don't care for the bald versions of the Frankenstein Monster.  Mary Shelley said he had long black hair.  Victor studied metaphysics, alchemy, and sorcery.  So why impose modern brain surgery in there?  If he can stitch a body together he can't add hair?  It's actually anti-realistic that he couldn't get a simple thing like hair right but he can create life.

  My biggest qualm (and this might be petty for some) is when our ""Genius"" scientist Terra says that in the 1790s no one would have known how to harness electricity. I guess she's never heard of Benjamin Franklin and his Lightning rod theory about conductivity?  Somehow it's more realistic to get electric eels in Bavaria to create life then to use lightning?  The Mary Shelley novel goes out of it's way to describe Victor seeing lightning strike a tree at age seventeen and being in awe at it's power.  He chose an attic to do his work.  And when he brought his creation to life, though the explanation as to how he did it was left vague, it was storming that November night in the novel.  This is one thing the older films got right.  Lightning was likely involved.

  And the writers should have seriously checked their history about when harnessing electricity was accomplished.  Mary Shelley knew about  Erasmus Darwin (who died in 1802) and his theories on electricity.  Someone writing this knows NOTHING about eighteenth century science.  They clearly didn't know about Benjamin Franklin's lightning rod conductivity theories and experimentations or about Erasmus's theory about electrical energy.  Now yes, in the novel Victor also read the work of Paracelsus (an alchemist) and Agrippa (a sorcerer) when he found the secret of life but lightning's electricity (not electric eels) was clearly involved.  And again, I found it brilliantly stupid that a modern scientist didn't know that conducting electricity was possible (Without electric eels!) in the 1790s.  As an occultist AND science lover and one who has studied theoretical physics, parapsychology and even, yes metaphysics (I have an honorary doctorate in that)  this bothered me to no end.  To me this was actually the worst mistake the film made.

  An electrophysiologist who doesn't know when electricity conduction was started and is clearly not even thirty yet with her own laboratory.  Yeah, okay...

  They also made Victor Frankenstein too old. In the novel he was seventeen when the idea hit him.  And twenty two or twenty four when he brought his creation to life.  He was a university student at Ingolstadt.  His father was only in his forties.  His youngest brother was barely six.  Victor was young!

The dialogue and plot were predictable. I guessed the entire story in advance.  And I have qualms about the beings of ""Good"" being forbidden from love considering how Corinthians goes on and on about it being the greatest virtue and closest thing to God. But it IS cheesy fun.

  I liked it.  It was cheesy fun and the first monster mash to have a version of the Frankenstein creature close to what Mary Shelley described.  They should have kept his 1790s look for the bulk of the film though.

  I liked that the gargoyles had a lair in a castle and then a clock tower. That is a nod to the Disney TV series Gargoyles, which I loved as a kid.

  I also like the nods to the classic Frankenstein films. Lines like ""Frankenstein must be destroyed"" from the trailer is a Hammer horror film title, the hair style from the 1831 illustration, and the hallmark mini-series was recreated for the 1790s flashback, the very opening scene is directly from the final scene of the award winning 2004 Hallmark mini-series of Frankenstein and was also re-created for the Off Broadway Frankenstein musical in 2010.  The name Adam comes from The Frankenstein Monster's own comparing of himself to Adam in Paradise Lost in the original Frankenstein novel. He tells Victor in the book ""I am the Adam of your labors"" and ""I should have been thy Adam."" The first time a Frankenstein Monster officially answered to the name Adam was in the 1966 TV series Dark Shadows.  The mate being called Eve comes from Dark Shadows and the 1985 film The Bride.  The electric eels (though I hate them) are from the 1994 Frankenstein film.  The claim that he is soulless comes from the silent Frankenstein film ""Life without a soul"" (This idea is not from the original novel. In the novel he was very spiritual and fully believed he had a soul and no one doubted it).  The line ""It's alive"" is from the 1931 Boris Karloff film.  The restraint chair that The Gargoyles put Adam in briefly is from Bride of Frankenstein.  It's sad how many Frankenstein purists won't give this film a chance to see these lovely nods to previous Frankenstein incarnations.  You can tell someone who loves previous versions had a hand in this but there is an irrational rage and hatred against this movie that I, someone who loves Mary Shelley's novel, cannot fathom.

Sure, it's flawed and cheesy and predicable but it IS a fun movie that is the victim of a lot of hyper negative over-reaction.  It's really not that bad.  This is brain candy, a popcorn movie, a guilty pleasure.

It's like watching a role playing game come to life.  It was fun.  I would definitely watch it again.  And yes, I will buy it on DVD.  I hope the lost scene of the unfinished mate, Eve, is on the disc version.

I give this film a 7.5 out of ten.  It could be better but it could be a lot worse and it was fun.  And the first cheesy action fantasy to use the Frankenstein Monster even roughly from the novel.

Afterward musings:

My reasons why I think Adam had a soul all along:

1. In Mary Shelley's novel The Frankenstein Monster fully believed he had a soul. He talks about it many times and at one point questions if he's a new soul or the soul of one of the dead men and aniamls he's made from.

2. In most religions the soul is your consciousness able to live on after death. ""It's not that I have a soul. I am a soul. I have a body."" - Harry Dresden in The Dresden Files. But then again this film's theology is strange.

3. The free prequel graphic novel I, Frankenstein Genesis tells us that The Gargoyles can be wrong about people not having souls. In the backstory about Leonore the demons plan on tricking the gargoyles into accidentally killing humans (which they are forbidden from doing and results in the Gargoyle's own death) by hiding among humans in battle. The other gargoyles were unable to see the light in these humans until Leonore warned them about what the demons were planning. One even says something to the effect of ""Why wasn't I able to see the light in them before?""

4. The Gargoyles went out of their way, convolutedly, to convince The Creature that he has no soul in the graphic novel prequel, going as far as to have one of them pose as a woman for a year to trick him into thinking he's in love with her, just to tell him that he's soulless for wanting to stay with her. (Because it would put her in danger, apparently...) Why do that if he does not have a soul? This hints to me they (or one or a few of them) know he has a soul but have a bias against him because of how he was created.

5. We are told in the graphic novel prequel that gargoyles cannot kill someone who has a soul (a human), that gargoyle would die instead. Repeatedly in the graphic novel prequel graphic novel a gargoyle would either be talked out of killing Adam or would make up an excuse to not kill him. This suggests to me that they, at the very least, suspected that he had a soul.

6. They say only someone soulless can kill a gargoyle but at the same time a Gargoyle cannot kill someone who has a soul. That gargoyle will die. They never say how. What if Gideon's death in this film was the fulfillment of this notion, that if a gargoyle tries to take the life of someone with a soul he'll die instead. They weren't exactly specific how the gargoyle would die.

7.  As Gideon died he said ""God will surely damn you.""  How can you be damned without a soul to damn?  Gideon must have known in his dying moments that yes, Adam had a soul.

8.  t was the acknowledgement of his identity (and maybe realizing he had a soul) that made Adam able to resist the demon at the end.

9. Even Naberius  says ""You have a soul!""",1390867200,2,10440,4.547849462365591
6281347,4,B00IKM5LXG,This movie is about Frankensteins monster. It has been rebooted for modern audiences. He does not have bolts in his neck or a flat head but was obviously stitched together from dead bodies and reanimated. After the death of Dr. Frankenstein he wanders the earth for hundreds of years shunning people. He eventually gets pulled into a battle between the Gargoyles and the Demons. The Gargolyle represent good and the Demons represent evil. He has to choose sides. The story line is quite good and the action is great! Anyone that liked the series Underworld will most likely enjoy this move. If you are looking for the old style Frankenstein with neck bolts and a flat top head this movie is not for you.,1390780800,2,703,4.67741935483871
6281348,5,B00IKM5LXG,"Great spin on the classics.  It's the Archangel Micheal's Gargoyle guardians against the 666 fallen angels in an age old battle the ""Monster"" finds himself drawn into by fate and mischance.  The special effects are good as are the acting and directing.  Eckhart plays the role without any campiness in a straightforward, emotionally believable performance. Miranda Otto (LOTR) lends equal credibility as the Gargoyle Queen and of course Bill Nighy (Underworld & Pirates of the Caribbean) is, as always, superb in his quirky delivery.  Lots of fun and recommended on the IMAX 3-D for best effect & enjoyment at the theaters.  This will definitely be a welcome addition to my home movie collection.",1390694400,2,696,5.123893805309734
6281349,5,B00IKM5LXG,"Don't know why some folks are giving this movie bummy reviews but I thought it was GREAT!

This is not your normal old Frankenstein movie, but a modern update.  When Dr. Frankenstein tried to get rid of his creation, the monster killed the Doctor's bride in revenge and took off way up north.  The Doctor went after him and wound up dying in the process.  Some 200 years later, the ""monster"" has now returned.  Things are different.  Almost immediately, the monster is attacked by Demons!  Why?  Gargoyles come out of nowhere to try to help the monster!  What the heck?

This is a high-action, very impressive CGI film.  It is a fight to save humanity from the Demons.  The Gargoyles are the good guys and, although the battle began long ago, it is now revved up.  The Demons want the monster, but no one knows why.  Meanwhile, we wonder if the monster is a cold-blooded heartless dead thing, or a being with a soul, maybe even human.

Wonderful film and great job by Aaron Eckhart (aka-Adam/the Monster).  Gives you a new appreciation for those Gargoyles on top of old churches, too :)",1390694400,3,1086,4.578125
6281350,3,B00IKM5LXG,"""I, Frankenstein"" is a sequel to Mary Shelley's original ""Frankenstein"" with an interesting premise. Frankenstein's monster survives the death of his maker, Viktor Frankenstein, and a nearly deadly encounter with two grave-robbing demons, to spent two hundred years in lonely and bitter exile in the Far North. An angry monster returns to modern-day London and a war between a dwindling band of heaven-sent gargoyles protecting humans, and the legion of demons out to enslave mankind. The movie is very much in the style of the ""Underworld"" series; if that wasn't your cup of tea, you've been forewarned.

The demons, led by Bill Nighy as the urbane but nasty Prince Naberius, have a plan that involves duplicating Frankenstein. The monster (Aaron Eckhardt) would prefer to go his own way. He takes some persuading to pick a side in this fight; his choice will be influenced by Naberius' lovely chief scientist Terra Wade (Yvonne Strahovski), who will have her own eyes opened to a new reality.

The plot is perilously thin in places. The production offers decent but generic special effects. Fortunately, the action moves briskly right along and it's hard not to root for Frankenstein, especially in his dramatic new incarnation as a self-questioning monster with martial arts skills in search of a purpose in life. Cautiously recommended as an afternoon's entertainment.",1390608000,15,1372,5.203619909502263
