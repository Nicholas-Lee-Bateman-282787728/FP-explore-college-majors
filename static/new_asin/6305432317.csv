1019609,3,6305432317,"I just finished watching the video on a dark and chilly August night in Arctic Alaska.  The plot had a lot of promise, with its numerous twists....and the New Orleans and Key West locales were  great......especially the New Orleans Garden District.
I've admired  Cuba Gooding for Boys in the Hood, but here he doesn't seem like a person  being hunted by the law.  He is too laid back and  seems to be laughing at  his own character.
The other characters are not really developed and I  couln't always see Berringer and Gooding too clearly because they were  always smoking. I really wish it had been better.  Gooding has lots of  promise......but we may have to wait for his next couple of efforts. Earl  Finkler",935884800,,712,4.653225806451613
1019610,4,6305432317,"Intriguing plot line with captivating twists - a lawyer becomes the plagiarist author of a best-selling book describing several murders, which murders unbeknownst to him actually occurrred.  He becomes the prime  suspect but, somewhat convolutedly, runs down the truth.  The tale  captures your attention, like a book you don't want to put down.  But, with  some exceptions, the acting is so-so.  Something lacks in Cuba Gooding's  performance, he doesn't ""grab"" you.  The fetching young book  publisheress, who becomes his patron and lover, is unbelievable.  Beringer  is OK but possibly overplays his role as the tough cop.  Most skilled  performance in the film is by Mark Pellegrino, who plays five (!) roles  adeptly, though one of his roles (the old man) is rather contrived.  A  short on the DVD showing his makeup processes for the five roles is  interesting.  Don't expect miracles, but if you fancy mysteries with  intriguing twists, this one is worthwhile.  -- Tom in Ocean City, MD,  joined in by Linda of Salisbury, MD",935280000,2,1031,5.0843373493975905
1019611,5,6305432317,"I enjoyed this movie very much. Cuba Gooding, Jr. was outstanding in the lead role, and the plot was original enough to take and keep my interest. I would recommend this movie highly to anyone who likes simply enjoyable  films. Two thumbs up!",931910400,,242,4.627906976744186

I loved Gooding and so many others in the movie so that that gets a couple of stars. And, I love happy endings....another star. I enjoyed it.

1019855,2,6305432317,"If a cast of Cuba Gooding Jr,Tom Berenger and Eric Stolz are not enough to keep you from watching this movie than this review certainly isn't going to dissuade you but here it is any way.

Music: Terrible
Writing: 8th grade drama class at best
Plot: Meh (and it's the strongest element of the movie)
Accents: They kinda tried...but not very hard
Acting: They all acted like they knew how bad the script was so I guess that part was ok

This is one of those times where I imagine a group of film majors were sitting around imagining the worst possible cast put in the least appropriate roles they could think of and then somebody drunk dialed Gooding's agent.",1500854400,,658,4.475

1019940,5,6305432317,"O.K., what did the professor have anything to do with defense attorneys getting their guilty clients off? Did he have a family member, or someone else that was murdered, and the guilty person got acquitted? Why would he plan such an ELABORATE scheme against a defense attorney, that ruined his career because of his morals...wouldn't defend his guilty client....even exposing his own clients guilt in the courtroom? Why did the professor just murder the other attorneys, and then frame the attorney that had a conscience?

1019944,1,6305432317,"Ok, I have no idea what the other reviewers were watching but this is a proper stinker of a movie.
Only really bad acting and direction could ruin a pretty good story line, and this manages to do just that.
Watch it if you:
* love mega cheesy early 90s movies
* can tolerate an over-egged accent, trying to do a film-noir type narration, throughout the entire 2 hours
* think that women saying ""I'm daddy's little girl"" while draped over a piano in a hallway, with a saxophone playing in the background, is really sexy
* really can't spot prosthetic masks
As I said, proper stinker.",1491436800,,582,4.4485981308411215

Cons, cons, cons - Will movie makers EVER learn that people in New Orleans don't talk anything like this? At all! Not even close. Nowhere near these South Carolina drawls in the movie.

Wrong, because the murders described in the book are true and now the hero is accused of the murders.  It has a few 'Don't go in there!' moments.

The plot was predictable and the movie was way too long (they could have shortened it by 40 minutes and been ok).  When I was watching it, it seemed strangely familiar.  I'm still not sure if it was because the plot was so predictable or because The Words with Bradley Cooper and Zoe Saldana was almost the exact same story - only done slightly better.

1025455,3,6305432317,"For 1999, this was a good movie. Fifteen years later, it holds up pretty well, though not well enough for a fourth star. I'm rarely a fan of Cuba Gooding Jr's acting, but this movie proves that his narration is even worse. In this case, it wasn't just Cuba's narration style, but the heavy reliance on it for the development of the story, making me feel as if the movie wasn't all that well constructed or written. I can't help but compare this to Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil with Kevin Spacey, a movie which is still just as good today as it was back in 1997, and this film pales by comparison.",1478217600,,607,4.241379310344827

He had no motive to go poke at a latent greed of a fishing assistant living a poor life, who himself had lost his life and career for standing for ethical lawyer practices. Poor direction on top of that. It's a wonder that the fugitive is clean shaven, goes around well dressed without any effort to hide himself! Everything from the lawyers decision to plagiarize, to him getting rich and sleeping with his seductive publisher looks stupid. Moreover, the ending is such a damp squib. Horrible waste of time.

1027730,2,6305432317,"I LOOK AT FILMS FROM SEVERAL POINTS OF VIEW . EXCITING ACTORS, GOOD SCRIPTS, PROVEN DIRECTOR , FILM LOCATION IF PART OF PLOT ,SOUND TRACK AND SO ON. I KNOW THERE ARE MANY PEOPLE ON THIS SITE WHO REALLY ENJOYED THE FILM .I did not. I  WAS DISAPPOINTED BECAUSE I EXPECTED MORE FROM FROM THIS LEVEL OF ACTORS AND what should have been an enticing plot.
 This is not Cuba Gooding's fault for this unexciting ,unthrilling film. This actor director combo have failed a few times before. The premise is not new. A winning criminal attorney reevaluates his successes in the courtroom and decides he can no longer defend the guilty. This happens in the middle of a case and forces a mistrial much to the dismay of his client. UH OH !  After being forced to  leave his practice of law he takes a long vacation to write a book. From this point on The movie dropped off. There was no tension where tension should have been building .
 Even an actor of Cuba G. Track record (mostly good) can't add any life to what becomes a very predictable film. Even the twist at the end just doesn't fit. The twist is such an important part of this film and it seemed so forced to make it work. The script seemed to be written scene by scene during the filming( at least the dialogue appeared that way). Oddly , the supporting cast (especially Eric Stoltz once again playing a slime ball)are terrific actors. They too can not add the energy needed to bring this film to life. I ordered this film for two reasons. I liked the cast and the suspense genre (created by a courtroom lawyer who creates his own mystery). The actors seem to be going through the motions of trying to give a good performance but seemed so limited by a not very exciting script. The plot is good but the script fails to keep the plot suspenseful. I rarely say much about a film I find disappointing but as the cast was composed of actors I have admired for consistently good performances I will speak up. Just not a good (forget great) film experience. Why two stars and not one if I feel this way?  One additional star as I learned something about the meaning of the title . Therefore ,it was not a complete loss or a one star movie.
I always felt if there are more positive reviews (opinions) then negative then go with the majority. In this case I really feel I need to disagree with the majority.",1442620800,,2347,4.371559633027523

I mean that in a good way. I would have never thought him deductive enough to figure out the guilty party in the beginning. It was a fast moving story that I really enjoyed.

1028235,4,6305432317,"Sometimes a film is so well written, that even though you know what's coming, you're still on the edge of your seat. A Murder of Crows is an independent film with some big time star power, that makes a terrific story that much better. The film focuses on Lawson Russell, (Cuba Gooding Jr.) a successful New Orleans defense attorney, who suddenly finds his conscience. A series of events leads to his disbarment, so he begins life a new in Key West. Once there, he meets a lonely old man looking for a friend. The old man insists that Russell read his crowning achievement, a novel. Russell is more than impressed with the book and goes to tell his friend about it when he finds that the old man has died. Russell then suddenly loses his conscience again and decides to pass the book off as his own. Russell's life seems to be back on track until the FBI shows up and arrests him. As it turns out, the murders depicted in the book weren't fiction and Lawson Russell is the prime suspect. From there the film turns into a mystery, who was this old man? Why did he set Lawson up? Who is the real killer? As I said the story is ingenious and very well written, unfortunately, I watch a lot of movies and actually figured the whole thing out, twenty minutes into the film. It wasn't that the film was predictable, most of the other reviews I've read seem to suggest that most people were shocked by the ending. I have no idea why I figured out what was going on so quickly, but this film is so good, that even knowing what was going to happen, I still loved it. Cuba Gooding Jr. was just off the charts good in this movie, he brings such energy and charisma to this role, that it easy rivals his Academy Award winning performance in Jerry McGuire. The rest of the cast is terrific as well, but all the other parts were seemingly bit parts that centered around Lawson Russell. This movie was the perfect fit for Cuba Gooding Jr. and was one of the best written films I've seen all year. A Murder of Crows proves that you don't need a big budget, with huge special effects, in order to make an extremely entertaining film. Gems like this one are rare, but ultimately are the whole reason I watch Independent films.",1378080000,,2207,4.372262773722627

1028241,2,6305432317,"Cuba Gooding Jr. plays a disbarred defense attorney whose return to prominence through a plagiarized novel is actually a frame-up in A Murder of Crows.  The film maintains a brisk pace and is mildly entertaining on a low-brow level, but the plot holes and preposterous actions of the protagonist are so ludicrous that the film becomes humorous.  Gooding is an actor who leans too heavily on his schtick of standard gestures and reactions.  In lesser efforts like these, he approaches self-parody.  When combined with his character's cluelessness to the killer's appearances as a number of different people - all in unconvincing rubber masks - the mystery reaches near-hilarity.  It doesn't help that his nemesis uses a number of obvious pseudonyms; I expected him to introduce himself as ""Mark Twain"" next.

Tom Berenger gives a solidly workmanlike performance as a grizzled New Orleans detective.  As always, it seems like the actor has a miserable taste in scripts. One wonders whether this dreck is the only thing offered to him.  At times, glimmers of talent appear, but Platoon seems to have been the sum total of his career.

I wouldn't be surprised if this film appears one day on Mystery Theater 3000.  It is perfect fodder for wiseguy quips.",1367193600,,1250,4.995169082125604

1028474,2,6305432317,"It is an unfortunate fact that many mystery writers, of both novels and screenplays, are often far better at concocting a great set-up, the perfect crime as it were, than they are at resolving the story in any realistic or believable way.  This movie is another similarly unfortunate example.

If all one read was the synopsis -a man is given a manuscript for which he falsely takes credit, but which details crimes for which he is subsequently charged after he has destroyed all evidence to the contrary- it sounds good.  A classic locked room mystery.  The problems here are both the telling of the larger story and the resolution.  The beginning of the story is muddied with both unnecessary characters and exposition, for little of it actually matters once the trap is sprung on Cuba Gooding, Jr.'s character...and that only happens after he is taken in by a series of characters wearing disguises so bad that they'd not pass muster in a high school play.  Unbelievably escaping the police in both New Orleans and Key West after he is charged with the crimes detailed in the book, Gooding (who never changes his clothes throughout the latter half of the movie, but never looks a bit rumpled either) slowly pieces the truth together.  Unlike ""Fracture,"" a great Anthony Hopkins movie that wove a similar impossible situation tale, this movie is all set-up and no delivery, for while the actual killer's motive for one of the aforementioned murders is made clear, absolutely nothing else is.

We can only guess at the killer's connection to the other victims, his connection to Gooding's character, and have no idea how or why hot-on-the-trail detective Tom Berringer arrives at just the right moment to save Gooding from becoming the killer's next victim.  Like the soon-to-be-dead teenager in the slasher movies who goes to the basement when the entire audience knows she shouldn't, Gooding meanwhile does everything possible to further incriminate himself at the pivotal end sequence.  I mean, hasn't the man ever heard of fingerprints????

In the film's final minutes, Gooding is charged with we-never-learn-what, and is acquitted -in the face of an incredible amount of evidence- we never learn how.  And then the movie ends.

Thematically, the movie is all over the block, first giving the audience 10,000 reasons to hate lawyers, and then having redemption and deliverance come only at the hands of (and only be possible through) an attorney.  So what is the audience supposed to come away thinking?

Throughout this film, its low budget is telegraphed in a thousand different ways.  Berringer's character is only believable by TV Cop standards, and the rest of the characters are unnecessary, unbelievable, or 2-dimensional.  These flaws, coupled with the gaping holes in the story, make this a failure in spite of Gooding's best efforts.  Not really worth the time it takes to watch it because it is, in the end, a muddled mess and quite dissatisfying.",1267401600,5,2963,5.0

An old man hires him to take him out and they become friends. The old man has a manuscript that he wants the lawyer to read, but dies before it can be returned. He has no family and the lawyer decides to get the book published as his own work.

1028560,3,6305432317,"A Murder of Crows (Rowdy Herrington, 1999)

Herrington, best known for the Patrick Swayze vehicle Road House, turns in a by-the-numbers thriller here. Not awful, but not great, either. Lawson Russell (Cuba Gooding, Jr.) is a recently-disbarred lawyer who got the ax after recusing himself from the trial of Thurman Parks III (Eric Stoltz), a slimeball even Russell can't bring himself to defend. A year later, low on cash and running a fishing boat in the Florida Keys, working on his perpetually-unfinished novel, he meets an old man with the improbable name of Christopher Marlowe who wants him to read over a manuscript. He goes to return it the next day and finds the old man has died of a heart attack, so Russell appropriates the manuscript, which of course becomes a smash success-- after which Rusell becomes the target of obsessive-cop stereotype Clifford Dubose (Tom Berenger), because all the murders in the book Russell appropriated really happened, and now he's the prime suspect. I'm pretty sure you can figure out what happens from there.

It's mildly amusing, and good acting is turned in by Stoltz, Gooding, and Berenger, though they have little to do other than play cardboard cutouts. Ashley Laurence also shows up as Gooding's publisher, and any excuse to see Ashley Laurence on a screen is worth your time; it's got an empty-calories feel to it, however, and a few days after seeing it, you're likely to start wondering if you remember certain details (say, for example, the entire last half-hour of the film) correctly. ** ",1176336000,5,1545,4.957528957528957

Gooding's character is an everyman type character -- not perfect, but a good man. He gets disbarred for doing what he believes is right. Then, later in the movie he gets in trouble when he does something he knows to be unethical. The character is sympathetic because extraordinary circumstances (believable due to a well-written plot) force him to make some tough decisions. Maybe we would have reacted differently, but we understand his reasoning. So, when he finds himself accused of a murder he did not commit, we root for him to come out on top. Can he discover the murderer before the police catch him? Gooding is great, but this twisting, thought-provoking plot is an absolute star! A vastly underated movie.

I've always liked Cuba Gooding Jr. (""Snow Dogs"") and he is very affable in this film. You can't help but root for his character, even after he does something really, really dumb. The motto ""Pride cometh before a fall"" certainly applies in this movie, and Gooding's character suffers dearly for it. He should have realized this simple wisdom--don't try to take shortcuts with certain things. They'll only come back to haunt you later. And they do for him.
Even though the credits list Tom Berenger as one of the main stars, he's actually got more of a supporting role. But he does just fine in his part as a grouchy policeman who is on the tail of Gooding Jr. for a crime he didn't commit. Eric Stoltz does well as a sleazy rich guy--those clean cut good looks conceal a really creepy character.

1028648,4,6305432317,"Cuba Gooding, Jr. plays Russell Lawson, a black defense attorney in present day New Orleans, Louisiana.  The film opens on Lawson, who is having an epiphany regarding his perception of his job and the people he defends.  The camera picks up a red-faced devil walking deliberately through the Mardi Gras-packed streets and the metro party that is in full swing.  The devil pays a visit to Lawson, pulling out a pistol and preparing to kill him when he hears Lawson tell the judge that he wants to pull out of the current case he's trying.  Thurman Parks III, Lawson's client, only that afternoon admitted that he killed the lap dancer he's accused of murdering.  The next day, Lawson destroys his legal career, throws away his future, and crucifies his client on the witness stand.  In only a short time, Lawson is a fishing charter captain in Florida.  He meets an old man who gives him a novel about the murders of five attorneys who used their skills to help killers go free.  Later that day, the old man turns up dead.  Having what he is certain is a bestselling novel, Lawson rewrites the book, claims it is his own, and becomes an overnight sensation and millionaire.  Then he's arrested because the murders in the novel were all based on the murders of prominent attorneys.  Lawson becomes part of a cunning cat-and-mouse chase that keeps the viewer glued to his or her seat.
Cuba Gooding, Jr. has been in dozens of movies and has been an outstanding actor.  Writer/Director Rowdy Herrington has also written STRIKING DISTANCE and ROAD HOUSE, both action flicks known for cunning little plotting loops.  Although only in the movie for a short time and never completely living up to his past potential, Tom Berenger plays the NOPD homicide cop that chases Lawson down.  Eric Stoltz plays the positively smarmy lap dancer murderer.
A MURDER OF CROWS stands out as a suspenseful thriller.  Enough twists and turns exist within the movie to keep even the most jaded thriller fan on the edge of his or her seat.  Conventional double-crosses only set the viewer up for plot twists and turns that throw monkeywrenches in even the astute thriller fan's pre-conceptions of how the movie is going to turn out.  Although the acting performances are good, the thing that really drives the movie is the plot.  The action is tight and the pacing moves along quickly.  The literary and philosophy clues will catch the eye of a student of both or either, and plays fairly with the viewer on those accounts.
One aspect of the film and the plot that rankles somewhat is the fact that the ultimate villain is completely hidden from view.  Also, Lawson's ability to move around in plain daylight while a massive manhunt was underway for him takes an effort to suspend the disbelief.  How Lawson and Dubose linked up would have been nice to see because that came out of left field at one point.  The movie was more about the plot twists and turns than about the way Lawson survived financially, but those aspects would have tightened up the viewing experience a little.
A MURDER OF CROWS is great movie for the thriller/suspense fan who likes a little whodunit? in his or her viewing experience.  People who liked TWILIGHT, SPY GAME, THE GINGERBREAD MAN, OCEAN'S ELEVEN, or SHATTERED will enjoy this movie as well.",1022371200,2,3299,4.749122807017544

MURDER revolves around a disbarred lawyer who scams his way into a success, but, through a devious plot twist, becomes the main suspect in a string of brilliant homicides.  The script by Herrington is absolutely involving.  It's detailed, well paced, and very smart.  Despite a few goofy or cheesy lines, which are pretty much due to bad acting in certain parts, the script is solid.
The direction is as haunting as it should be in this type of film and Herrington really turns up the suspense.  His slow shots or disoriated handhelds are in the right places, and it only adds to the tenseness of the story.
Cuba Gooding Jr. is completely fascinating in this role.  He gets into it all the way and makes you believe him, even in the most incredible scenes.  Tom Berrenger, however, does not fare as well.  Even though he proved in the past that he was a decent actor, he slips a bit, and some of his lines are given like he was reading them off of cue cards.  However, he's good enough that it doesn't distract from anything else, and in some scenes, he's excellent.  The supporting cast, including Marianne Jean Baptiste and Eric Stoltz, is very good and only adds to the film.  Stoltz is smarmy and oozes charisma and Baptiste has a very soothing, sweet, grandmother-type air about her.  They are the best they could be.
Overall, A MURDER OF CROWS is a highly overlooked film that should be scene by lovers of suspense.  The guessing game that is involved throughout the story doesn't make you feel stupid, but it doesn't give much away either.",1007078400,35,1693,4.588039867109635
1028747,3,6305432317,"A Murder of Crows--I had never heard of this movie before renting it, and I had no idea why. I know now though. Sure, it's a good cast on paper.  But, having arguably the worst performance of a bright career by Gooding, and just bad casting overall, it really took its toll on an interesting and thought provoking plot.
To some, this film was predictable.  But to me, it was total opposite.  I don't know, maybe I'm just brain dead, but there were some major zigs and zags.
The movie did drag somewhat during the investigation scenes, but overall, the pacing and directing were quite good.  The last 20 or 30 minutes though were definitely worth sticking around to see.  Maybe taken half heartedly by some of the actors, but it didn't ""murder"" the movie.  3 Stars",1006992000,,763,4.532846715328467
1028748,5,6305432317,"This was a story about a lawyer named Russell Lawson (played by Cuba Gooding, Jr.) who realizes his client is guilty of murder so he causes a stir in the trial and ends up getting disbarred. He tries to be a writer, but isn't having any luck actually writing anything. One day he meets an old man and they quickly become friends. The man gives him a manuscript to read, which he said he wrote, called A Murder of Crows. It's brilliant. When Lawson goes to return it, he discovers that the man has died from an apparent heart attack. With no known family, he decides to keep the manuscript, place his name on it, and submit it to a publisher. It's an instant success, but he's arrested for murder when a detective reads the book and recognizes the descriptions as being of murders that were actually committed. He realizes that the details in the book would only be known by the actual killer. Obviously, we know that Lawson didn't commit the murders, but who did? That's what this movie is about. There are numerous twists and turns in the story and it kept me on the edge of my seat throughout. The ending is probably a little too neat, but I still recommend this movie highly to anyone who likes suspense.",999388800,19,1207,4.441441441441442

1028752,4,6305432317,"In this suspense yarn, Gooding plays a recently disbarred attorney who finds himself in a Kafka-esque situation, charged with murder and on the lamb. Gooding is great in the role, as is Tom Berringer playing the cop  who's after him. But what is really captivating is the plot, with very  surprising twists and terrific suspense. Thoughtful and intelligent - very  entertaining and well worth seeing. Only four stars because some might say  its a bit predictable - but I didn't find that detracted much at all.",963014400,2,510,4.895348837209302

1028754,5,6305432317,"This movie stars Cuba Gooding, Jr. as a defense attorney who has suddenly had an attack of conscience and betrays the trust of a client, ultimately causing him to lose his license to practice law. He travels to Florida to  write a novel and finds out writing novels are a lot harder than he  expected (I can vouch for that. I am writing a novel myself, but in the  past year I have come a lot further than six pages, which was where Gooding  was in the same amount of time).
While in Florida, he meets an old man  who gives him a copy of a book he is writing for an opinion. The book was  ""brlliant."" When Gooding takes the book back to the old man, he  finds out the man has past away. So he takes credit for writing it, gets it  published and finds out that the murders that took place in the book really  happened and now he is wanted for murder.
The cast delivered excellent  performances, especially Gooding.
It will make you think twice about  taking credit for something that you did not do.
This movie comes highly  recommended.

7888833,2,6305432317,"A complete turn-off to see detective and lawyer have little to none ability to deductive reasoning.

Without spoiling the plot, I think this is quite poorly written and scripted for such a movie.
The movie left me feeling like watching a cheesy movie rather a thriller.
Suspense is gone the moment you realize the ""best lawyer"" running around like a headless chicken, instead of establishing facts to counter claims/charges he may face.
And for the detective, never mind.

Watch it if you like both Berirnger and Cuba. Other than that, this movie doesn't have that zeal that propels you to the end.",1504396800,,598,4.852941176470588
