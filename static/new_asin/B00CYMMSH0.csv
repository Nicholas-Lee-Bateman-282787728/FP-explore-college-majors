5751949,5,B00CYMMSH0,"I've seen this movie 4 times and finally broke down and bought it.  A found footage film about a group of mostly college-age students who want to make a documentary of their retracing of the famous Dyatlov Pass incident (which is a true incident, unfortunately).  If you pay careful attention at the beginning, you will understand the end, but still be shocked by it.  The interesting facts and conjectures about the real Dyatlov Pass tragedy are fascinating. Must have a high tolerance for millennial flirty dialogue.

5751952,2,B00CYMMSH0,"This movie oh boy oh boy this movie...

Where to begin. It basically uses the same old found footage recipe except the footage would never of been found so not really a found footage movie, Just a shot pov from peoples cam movie I guess.

They use a real life tragedy filled with uncertain and likely never to be answered questions in the form of the Dyatlov Pass Incident. Which largely is mysterious for the simple question of why would 9 experienced hikers/mountaineers feel compelled to cut their way out of their tend and scatter into the sub freezing night barely clothed?

However this movie then decides to really jump the shark. For whatever reason they decide to drag the much more hoax like story of the philidelphia experiment into the mix and just get weird in the end.

Id of sooner found a killer yeti or aliens to be a more satisfying end then what they gave us. It felt alot like we had the ending to a completely different movie jammed onto the end of this one.

Atthe end I was just shaking my head and asking myself why not actually try to give us some semi believable scenerio for what had actually happened. Instead I felt like they just kind of forgot about the real incident and it left me going how does any of this ending even really tie into what may have actually happened?

Frankly to anyone with a remote interest in the real history mystery Id say stay away from this. To any with low standards for acting and story that just likes a weird silly movie with characters you look forward to seeing die go for it.

Myself personally Im sorry I wasted time on this especially  because at first I thought it might at least try to give us a theory based on the writers own ideas. But if the writer thinks like this they belong on fan fic forums. not writing for movies even low budget indie ones.",1521936000,,1820,4.379821958456973

Throw some totally unlikable characters into an outrageously idiotic scenario and finish with a twist ending that you see coming from a mile away and you get Devil's Pass. I admit I had some hopes for this movie but these students were more stupid than the ones in the insurance commercials. What is the dumbest thing we can do right now? Okay, let's do it. Then the preposterous reason for the incident at the pass made me almost throw a shoe through the television. I love B movies that are silly, but the ones that actually take themselves seriously and still insult your intelligence I just can't take. Also, our lead actress had two emotions. One was giddy to the point of making you puke and the other was terrified hysteria which got pretty old pretty quick. This movie was a dog.

Going in I wasn't expecting much because he'd said it wasn't great, but it was entertaining enough and I did like the twist at the end! I didn't find the characterization particularly good (which is actually kind of disappointing, because one reason I thought the original Dyatlov Pass story was so compelling was because of the history and personalities of the hikers themselves). Effects are decent, scenery is pretty exceptional. If you're into ""found footage"" or are like me and just wanted to see a new take on the old mystery, give it a shot.

I am not a fan of that kind of camera work where everything is shaky and moving around like I am watching ""The Blair Witch Hunt."" The effect where pretty good and when the movie got exciting I did get scared. It may of been because I watched it in the dark and by myself. Without giving anything away lets just say it reminded me of a government experiment gone terribly wrong. There are so many movies about this sort of thing. Taking a human and ""transforming them"" will some how  result in the ultimate super weapon.

This movie isn't for everyone. If you enjoy b movies you will probably enjoy this. It is true it does take a rather unexpected turn, but I happened to like the twist they put in at the end. I found it unique.

In any case, while this movie has ties to the real incident, it pretty much just provide a summary of what happened. The story and characters are fictional so I wouldn't read too much into it.",1500940800,,590,4.121739130434783

To me it was an obvious case of paradoxical undressing, and confusion brought on by hyperthermia. However, what this movie did with the premise of that ""mystery"" is great.
  More science fiction than the monster movie you would expect considering the story it is based upon. Good science fiction at that. With a surprisingly good twist at the end. None of the performances were particularly nerve grating. A common problem for me with found footage. Of course you have the awful cinematography, but I forgive that because this is a good story, and without being able to save production money by making it found footage it might not have been made.

The Dyatlov Pass incident follows a group of American students on a trek to investigate the true life mystery of nine Russian skiers who befell unexplained deaths while in the Russian mountains in 1959. To this day, their deaths have been one of the most bizarre unsolved mysteries of the 20th century.

This is a fantastic movie from beginning to end, partially based on a true story and a new wicked twist with elements of horror and sci-fi, the movie starts with a small amount of character building but once the story unfolds it gets really gripping and keeps you sucked in and wanting to know what's going on! The movie has a wildly imaginative ending with some cool little twists, the cast is all good here and the music score, this is a must see if you've not seen it, highly tense little gem, very entertaining, certainly worth a repeat viewing too. This is probably one of the best movies Renny Harlin has ever directed too.

5751998,3,B00CYMMSH0,"I really, really expected to hate this. I watched it because I desperately needed something in the background as I worked on something else. I, as so many other viewers, am so tired of the ""found footage"" horror full of badly written, poorly acted characters playing out some tired old plot with absolutely no originality. The Blaire Witch had the advantage of novelty, at least, but I by the end of that movie I hated every one of those characters and was glad to see the witch getting a nice meal. This--other viewers are not so keen on the characters, but I found them to be tolerably less hateful than comparable characters in other movies. Neither the writing nor the acting will be receiving any academy awards, but considering the genre/class of the movie, this is not a shock.
This was an ambitious project, and they really did some good things with it. Shooting it in the Ural mountains is probably what took this movie up a notch in quality. That and actual Russian actors speaking Russian, not Americans with bad accents pretending to be Russians. Also, it was nice to see that most of the tired old stereotypes were either played down, or scrapped entirely.

The ending--ok, I'm sure that if I had been paying close attention the whole time and not working on something else, I would have gathered all the bits and pieces of things and put it all together for the big reveal. Since I wasn't, though, I was left scratching my head a little. Don't get me wrong--it's a more interesting ending than I've seen in a long time, and it even managed to give me a little chill (pun totally intended), which is not easy to do. As my great great grand-uncle's liver was to moonshine, my brain is hardened to the devices of horror cinema.

If you have watched any of the Documentaries on this subject, or the movie, many of the ""facts"" have been distorted or simply omitted all together. There are some things that I never even heard about watching the documentaries, and although fairly accurate in the telling of the trip made by the hikers, the movie goes way off into fiction once they arrive at the site. If you are interested in the mystery of these missing hikers you will undoubtedly enjoy this work. It chronologically lays out what has been learned of the lead up to their disappearance and the subsequent investigation. It also refines the clues and details of the investigation. I will end this review at this point because if I do continue it would be a spoiler. Buy the Kindle version and it is worth it. I have drawn my conclusions about this incident and am about 95 % satisfied with the theory.

5752015,2,B00CYMMSH0,"Devil's Pass. Unless you are addicted to found-footage films, I would ""pass"" on this one. The advertising shows the back of a nude girl bathing in a stream, an image that has nothing to do with the film. On the DVD where you are given several options for set-up or viewing, we see several scenes from the film including what looks like a seduction scene with a nude couple which does not appear in the film -- except in a cover-up version.

Later, the female version of this censored scene vanishes in a snow avalanche that is supposedly caused by someone or something. Too bad because she is the more attractive and interesting female character. Two members of the explorer group find a door in  the side of a mountain which is locked on the outside. Ooooooooo. People who might be rescuers shoot at our heroes. Who are they -- Soviet police or military? What is the reason?

Somehow the Eldridge from the Philadelphia experiment with inadvertent teleporting effects is brought into the story. Why? Because the creepy crawly creatures inside the mountain are really sailors who survived the time-travel and somehow ended up in the Soviet Union? Riiiight . . .

I won't give away any spoilers regarding the supposedly shocking ending (How many times have we heard that one?) except to say that I found it to be a confused mish-mash. One possibly-interesting time-tunnel aspect was sabotaged and thrown away. Why? Someone wanted a downbeat ending to destroy our investment in the characters like some horror movies are doing these days in order to throw at us a supposedly shocking ending? Forget about it.

Saddled by an annoying lead who chatters the whole film, it progresses rather slowly. There are situations that arise that could have been extremely creepy, but with poor writing and acting, the scenes just fall flat.

Someone in the group has an agenda and will sacrifice anyone in the group just to meet it. Someone knows something that should have been revealed, and ends up apologizing for not telling it sooner.

5752042,3,B00CYMMSH0,"In a lot of ways this movie reminded me of The Objective, from a few years ago.  An ""X Files""-like story unfolds not in middle America but rather in an exotic location (in The Objective the location was the Middle East; here it's Russia).  But like The Objective, the narrative payoff is not satisfying and feels sort of canned.

I did really appreciate the effort to expand out the usual conspiracy theory mythos to encompass the mysterious Russian wilderness. It was cool to see a American film production actually take the trouble of flying a crew all the way out to the Ural region, which looks extremely distinctive here, hire some actual Russian actors where needed, and so on. The on-location cinematography was sometimes extremely striking, and the crew's excitement about being on-site bled into the movie in energizing ways. I wish the movie had lingered a bit more on these strengths: local atmosphere, wild mysterious landscapes, the sense of exploration and adventure, etc.

As other reviewers have pointed out, the main actors are all extremely irritating -- though I guess that was the idea, since these are supposed to be cocky American college students. Like most people I'm sick of the ""found footage"" framing device, but I can accept it when it's put together with some actual wit (see for instance the amazing ""Trollhunter"").  Not much wit here though.  The movie doesnt have any humor to offer beyond some fratboy sexual humor.

*semi-spoilers below*

The movie's biggest weakness, though, was the ""explanation"" offered for the mysterious events at Datlov Pass.  The resolution is really quite a spectacularly derivative dud.  Some kind of garbled time-traveling zombies nonsense.  Given the exotic location, there were so many directions the makers of this movie could have gone: maybe there's a conspiracy involving the lost Russian aristocracy, the Cold War, a lost Axis encampment, etc. I was a little surprised to see the yeti mentioned so many times, but nothing about Tunguska.

5752055,3,B00CYMMSH0,"Another ""found footage"" movie, this one about a true incident.  In 1959, members of the Dyatlov group were found dead in the northern Urals under mysterious circumstances. No determination of how and why was ever reached.

 This movie follows a group of young filmmakers who have a grant to investigate that occurrence. I've never like the hand-held camera technique. It was at its worst in The Blair Witch Project and though it's done better here, it still is a deterrent, especially since a good portion of the movie is in the dark, using the camera's green night-vision.

 Apparently this movie was filmed in Russia with a Russian-American film crew.  The acting is good and the scenery beautiful and cold. The discovery of a ""bunker"" under a hill of snow offers so much potential but it isn't explored, ands the ending that fails as far as I'm concerned.

No conclusion is reached and the film ends as most usually do.  It's not even scary in most of the places it should be because it's so dark.  The ""creatures"" flit in like blips too quick to actually be seen.  Just once could we have these type films end with, if not an actual answer, at least some type of viable theory?  I think the time of the ""up in the air ending"" should be brought to an end. Is it a government experiment go awry...a yeti...creatures from space trapped here...what?

5752064,2,B00CYMMSH0,"Another indie, this a horror film out of Russia, based on a true event.  Yes, the true event was in 1957 when a group of something like 7 mountain climbers set out to climb Devils mountain, part of the Ural mountain chain.  When they didn't return, locals went looking for them.  They found all of them frozen to death, most of them barefoot, lying in the snow, in various locations around, but not IN, their camp.  Two had crushed skulls, two had rib fractures, the rest had no obvious injuries except for freezing to death.  Why were they barefoot?  There is a syndrome of thinking you are hot while you are freezing to death and taking clothes off, but they all had climbing experience to varying degrees and should have known better than to remove clothes.  Why weren't they at the camp?  Why were they scattered in different locations?  To this day, nobody really knows what happened.  Thats as far as the true story goes and all the rest is FICTION.  A group of 5 students from UNIVERSITY OF OREGONyupright heredecide to do their own little expedition (2 are experienced climbers, one a good cameraman, one good with audio equipment, and the fifth is the girl that thought up the project), try to follow the path of the climbers in 1957 and come up with an explanation of WHAT HAPPENED.
Here the film becomes derivative, in my opinion rather poorly scripted, and sometimes downright silly.  It does throw out a bunch of ideas of what happened, suggesting that at least some, or all of them together, are true, including: YETIS, aliens, a sort of tunnel to an alternate dimension, secret research on bringing the dead back to life, and the determination of the Russian military to keep the whole thing secret.  Wellisnt that kinda OVER-EXPLAINING the whole thing?  And yes, the characters make stupid, unrealistic decisions, just like in the Geico commercial that mocks horror moviesI give it a D+.  Oh: the final bad touch: it also makes use of FOUND FOOTAGE!  I think FOUND FOOTAGE may have reached its peak with the first use in Blair Witch Projectsince then, it all seems too derivative, since it didn't seem like that great an innovation in the first place.

Probably worth seeing, if you're patient, for the clever mystery behind the happenings on the mountain. The mystery of the original incident, the camera work, and the direction are pretty good. Sadly, the characters don't really make sense, nor does the premise of the movie itself. At best it was a sloppy afterthought to figure out why these people would be making their little movie in the first place. It was also left unexplained how the footage was found, and given where it ended up, by the movie's own logic, it never should have been found. Oh, and there was more than one camera, yet only one camera apparently survived, yet we see all the footage. There are also details of the original incident that aren't quite explained - the overall forces at work, yes, but the details of the scene, when the bodies were found are brushed aside in favor of the bigger picture. That's rather unsatisfying, particularly given how much the movie fixated on them. The one truly realistic element would be the portrayal of a psych grad student from a mid-tier college as one of the dumbest, most unbalanced, and certainly useless human beings you could ever meet, and who clearly hasn't the slightest actual interest in psychology, but thinks she's seeing into the truth of the universe, while on her own little trip.",1409702400,,1337,4.783549783549783

5752095,4,B00CYMMSH0,"I really enjoyed this movie. Well.. or sort of enjoyed. Got me freaked out a little bit. So basically they get facts right, but they don't say all of the facts that have been revealed so far. While the acting is surprisingly good and what they said about Philadelphia project is also true, if we are to trust documentaries, the plot of the movie is still not perfect. Aliens = yes, but teleportation device and mutants, that is a big no.
Also Russians do not murder scientists. If there is one person to kill scientists in reality , that was Stalin, but then again, he isn't really Russian, but Georgian. And Dyatlovs group were not hikers, but young scientists, if I remember correct. It could also be that one or few of them were sort of or scientists. In any way they went on expedition and they were quite prepared for anything, in other words, they were professionals.

Another fact, Russian military officers, scientists and other ''important'' so to speak people long ago said, that we aren't alone and extra-terrestrials are very real and we had contacts with them.

The military did not cover up this incident or hide and made super top secret or whatever. If it was hidden, then just from press for some time.

Now, why aliens? Because people for hundreds of years in the devil's pass were either abducted or murdered in strange non-human ways. That, and of course infamous lights in the sky. In English, sadly there is much less information than in Russian. Now, back to the movie. Have anyone asked permission from families of the deceased to make a sci-fi horror movie about this? I mean, c'mon, show some respect and ask for permission before shooting the movie.

These murders are brutal, sadistic and just horrible. I've seen enough footage, videos and whatever not, and it's really, really freaky. Oh and as Russians (which know the subject of Dyatlovs pass) say, they say not all aliens / alien races are peaceful. This base or whatever there is in the mountains has been there before human kind had technologies of primitive kind. They've been quite bad (that's not even the word to describe it) towards humanity, so learn from those Russians an take that into account. You have no idea, how freaky the deaths of those young people were. Oh and there was radiation on either all or some of them. The coffins were yellow on the inside from the corpses too. It's just.. there is so much freakiness in how awful their deaths were. Just try and research some of the information. If you find photos. keep on going and see as many as you can. It's just.. horrible. Poor people who would have very bright future if they lived, made a wrong decision and faced the real hell on earth.

I wonder when more Americans (like those ex-NASA directors speaking of lies, extra-terrestrials, etc.) will decide to uncover more secrets that government officials know about and use to their desires. Well, at least unlike American gvt. , Russians have different mentality and are more likely to answer this or other questions. But still... what happened in Dyatlovs pass is just incredibly horrible. Can't imagine how hard it was for their parents to see their children with grey hair, without eyes, tongues and.. ohh. God it's sick!

Thanks for making the movie, even though it was a sci-fi. At least more people will know about the incident. I just hope they wouldn't think of mutants and abominable snow-men on a killing spree, or any human base for scientific experiments gone wrong.",1400889600,,3485,4.723684210526316

Both disturbing.  Then I thought this would be down the same lane.  I was mistaken. This is not worth anyone's time for any reason.  It is done in the epic failure nonsense as Blair Witch Project.

You might sit in front of this nightmare... and I mean that in the sense of wasting time, and be mesmerized but really?

The Dyatlov pass deaths in 1959 may have been something to be further examined but with the alien suggestion I thought I might be watching something with the same credibility as The Fourth Kind... witch BTW is rather disturbing because of the documentation. (I pray that isn't also a deception).

5752114,5,B00CYMMSH0,"Director Renny Harlin is responsible for some of my favorite films from the past two decades.  Several of these movies were hated by critics, but I personally loved them.  Titles in this list include DIE HARD 2, CLIFFHANGER, THE LONG KISS GOODNIGHT, and DEEP BLUE SEA.  Im very happy to include a new title to this list:  DEVILS PASS.  This found-footage horror flick delivers on many levels and will give even the heartiest of horror fans something to enjoy.

Many horror fans are tired of the found-footage genre, but I still enjoy it.  There are so many things you can do within this subsection of horrorI enjoy seeing the diversity that filmmakers can come up with.

DEVILS PASS is shot well, and I have to specifically commend the camera work.  Whereas many found-footage films are shaky to the point of annoyance, this film keeps the picture on a pretty steady keel.  This makes for a much more enjoyable movie experience, especially in terms of suspense.

And speaking of that, theres plenty of terror in this little gem.  Granted, much of it doesnt hit until the last third of the filmbut thats perfectly ok here; the build-up is worth the wait.  Once things get going on the mountain, they never slow down.

The special effects are minimal but good.  I cannot go into much detail because I don't want to give away the plot.  But lets just say we don't get to see much, but what we do get is well done.

And speaking of the plot, DEVILS PASS will certainly make you think.  This flick is a conspiracy theorists dream.  I would not completely dismiss things like this as out of the realm of possibility at all, especially given what science has been able to accomplish recently.  The ending is superb, but I again cannot say anymoreI sure don't want to spoil it at all!

Directed by Renny Harlin (Die Hard 2, Cliffhanger), it's sadly reasonable why this movie received little press. But, this doesn't mean the film was awful. Devil's Pass was actually pretty good. I don't care for found-footage type films, but this intrigued me because of the story, and wow; i was not expecting this. The acting is good, but the script is lacking in many areas, and this is why (I think) the mind-bending ending doesn't feel as epic & terrifying. The visual effects are decent; you can tell where they started to reach the end of their budget, but honestly, i didn't think this took away from the film's atmosphere. But the cinematography in some scenes was absolutely stellar; captivating in a couple cases. Now, what really saddens me is why there aren't more horror/thriller movies that have a mind-blowing, memorable ending that completely turns the audience around, shifting into the sci-fi/fantasy genre. I hope there are at least a couple other movies that will be made in the future with similar plot twists and devices (but not as a found-footage film).

5752121,2,B00CYMMSH0,"Directed by Renny Harlin (Die Hard 2 Cliffhanger), Devils Pass is a thriller about five Oregon college students who travel to Russia. Their purpose is to research the so-called The Dyatlov Pass Incident, mysterious deaths of nine Russian ski hikers on February 2, 1959. There are several theories about this real-life incident, but its cause still remains unknown.

This means Devils Pass (alternate title The Dyatlov Pass Incident) is not really about what happened about fifty years ago under the Soviet regime (which sounds more intriguing to me). Renny Harlins thriller is about the ill-fated young American travelers in modern Russian mountains attempting to solve the mystery.

Please don't say Not again. Devils Pass is shot in the found-footage style like Blair Witch Project. Technically the visuals of Devils Pass are more than average. What is disappointing is that the film is very talky, especially in the first half. Frankly, the earlier part of the film is pretty boring, though the locations of the snow-covered mountains are beautiful to see. .

The story finally picks up in the last thirty minutes when things start to happen. I know I should not reveal what happens to these hapless students. But I can say you will find the conclusion either smart or outlandish. Sorry, but I was not impressed probably because the film seems trying too hard.

DEVIL'S PASS takes its premise from the Dyatlov Pass Incident in the Ural Mountains of Russia, 1959, where nine skiers died under very mysterious circumstances. In this film, some college students from Oregon return to Dyatlov Pass to try and find out what happened. And for better or worse, they succeed.

DEVIL'S PASS is a hard one to judge. The storyline and script are quite derivative of BLAIR WITCH PROJECT and other ""found footage"" films we've been seeing over the past few years, but the specifics are very different. It's realistically acted and filmed, has its share of surprises and turnabouts, and, though it is, of course, a work of complete fiction (with a factual springboard), gives a concrete answer to the question raised by its protagonists, which is more than you can say for many such films. Some will be satisfied with where DEVIL'S PASS takes them, but many others will be left wishing for something else. The creators of this film obviously had a hard choice regarding what they should make happen. While DEVIL'S PASS does not cop out, it doesn't reach its true potential either.

Reading some of the other reviews before watching this, I was braced for disappointment. Even though DEVIL'S PASS is not as fulfilling as it might have been, I was also far less disappointed than I might have been and can say with complete honesty that I was glad to see this film.",1389657600,,1399,4.7727272727272725

If you Google ""the Dyatlov Pass incident"" you'll see it involves the mysterious real-life 1959 deaths of nine student hikers in the Ural mountains. The bizarre circumstances surrounding the condition of the discovered bodies have raised numerous eyebrows over the years, and a plausible explanation has never been determined. Writer Vikram Weet spins a creepy little found-footage tale around these real-life facts, and Renny Harlan gives the story some visual punch. For me, though, it's the creatively off-the-rails ending that delivers some serious jumps punctuated by an especially creepy-yet-poignant coda.

If you look at the cover, read the synopsis... you expect folks stalked by monsters in the mountains.  While, that does eventually happen, the majority of the film the danger seems to be other people and nature.  By the time the actual creatures appear, the cast is already broken and weary, and only stay on camera for a few scattered minutes.  It just felt misleading.  What I thought was a creature feature came of more like a creature mercy-killing.

That particular rub aside, the film is decent.  Locations are quality.  Some character development, just enough to field a ""why this person is here"" background.  They did better with source material than many other films that use ""actual events"" gimmicks, though it clearly took liberties.  Creatures, when they appeared, were sub-par CGI, but were mostly in dim-lit or night-vision sequences, so it was fairly easy to ignore the slack work.  Ending ""twist"" was an odd choice, but looking back... not sure how else they could end it.  They painted themselves into a corner fairly effectively.

5752148,3,B00CYMMSH0,"In February of 1959, nine hikers in the Ural mountains were found dead. This is a fact.  There is a lot of mystery around the deaths. Apparently the hikers tore their way out of their tents. The images scattered around camp barefoot, and died of hypothermia. There are many people to this day who feel the deaths were part of a Russian government cover-up.

Devils Pass a 2013 (Rated R) UK-Russian horror film, directed by Renny Harlin). It is the fictional account of an American woman, Denise Evers (Gemma Atkinson) and her team of four others as they re-trace the steps of the original hikers on a trail through the east shoulder of the mountain Kholat Syakhl (which means, Mountain of the Dead)  also known as Dyaltovs Pass.

There is nothing extraordinary about the movie. It is filmed in the all too common Found Footage style, scenes spliced together from a couple of hand-held cameras. However, the acting was well done. J. P. Hauser (Luke Albright) and Audy Thatcher (Ryan Hawley) are hired on as expert climbers for the journey. While, Denises film crew consists of Holly King (Holly Goss) and Jensen Day (Matt Stokoe).

Prior to the trek, the team meets and interviews a woman who was part of the 59 Search Party. The woman (Nelly Nielsen) recounts events around the discovery of eleven bodies. Eleven, not the nine that has always been reported, adding to the conspiracy that the Russian government might have been involved in sweeping facts under the proverbial rug.

Finding their way toward the mountain, it becomes clear that Thatcher and Hauser are convinced that Denise is creating drama for her documentary, and not at all buying into anything supernatural about the deaths of the original nine hikers. With sub-zero temperatures, mysterious footprints around their camp, and a severed tongue  doubt is quickly turned to fear, and everyone except Denise want to abort the mission and just go back down the mountain.

I will not reveal what the reconstruction party discovers. At first, I thought it was lame. The movie had held my interest completely, up until the point revelations are made. I kept watching, regardless, and thankfully.  The twist that is not apparent until (like any good movie) is at the very end, and to me, made the movie over all that much more  I want to say brilliant, but if I do, it is for the twist and not the entire film. The film was good. The twist, brilliant.

Devils Pass entertained me. I did not play with my phone during it. No Facebooking, no texting (or minimal). And I enjoyed the story. For these reasons, I will give the movie 3 out of 5 Stars!

5752149,3,B00CYMMSH0,"The Devil's Pass is a ""found footage"" film about a film crew investigating the mystery of the Dyatlov Pass Incident that occurred in 1959. (If you're not familiar with the story, it's worth additional reading; quite interesting stuff) I enjoy found footage films when they are done well. And though I wouldn't consider this one great, it's a decent flick. The pacing is rather slow. There's not a ton of action until near the end, but it wasn't so slow that I became bored. Without giving anything away, the story itself was ok, but the end felt a bit silly to me. I did enjoy the sorta ""twist"" at the end that ties certain things together. I think the writing could have been better. It did feel like there was too much explanation about the story crammed in at the end. Overall though, this is an ok film. It reminds me of The Blair Witch Project as far as found footage films go. It's worth a watch and possibly worth owning if you can find it real cheap.",1388188800,,958,4.387640449438202
5752150,4,B00CYMMSH0,"Looks as though the ""found footage"" genre of film making will be with us for awhile.

Here's the scoop. A group of 9 Russian mountain climbers head for an expedition in the Ural Mountains. A short while later the bodies of all 9 are found frozen to death. The ""official"" explanation is death due to exposure but certain things don't add up. Now a group from Oregon State University are mounting their own expedition to determine what really happened to the original 9.

Though the 4 stars I gave this might be me rounding up, I liked it better than giving it only 3. This is a cool, intelligent flick. Some aspects of the story are lifted, almost verbatim from ""The Blair Witch Project."" but I like this crew more. These are all bright, energetic college kids. The two hired on as guides really know their stuff. Armed with GPS, maps and the like, they do a lot of homework before they even get started. One of the party is a real conspiracy nut so he argues a lot of points with his version of logic which does make its own sense. Some really creepy stuff happens when they hit the spot where the original 9 cashed it in. And they discuss/argue every point of what they've discovered. A romance develops between the ""sound"" girl and one of the guides which lends a note to the story giving it a more natural feel.

On the downside: At times, when the tension is really high, they are still trying to figure stuff out where, logic tells me, they would save that for a time when they weren't in out and out survival mode. And something rears it's head late in the third act that I simply did not like. It seemed cheap to me.

Director Renny Harlin might not quite have lived up the the promise he showed early in his career but he does a decent job here. The actors also do a sweet job. I didn't know any of them but they all showed a very natural ability in front of the camera. I very much liked the script which meted out information early that would come into play later.

In 1959 nine Russian skiers died unexpectedly while on The Dyatlov Pass. There have been many theories including; hypothermia, avalanche, UFO and they reached the spot where two world's collide. A group of students from Oregon decide to recreate the trip in order to find out what happened and finally solve the mystery. Before anyone gets excited about this, the 1959 event is true but this movie is another ""found footage"" type movie. I am a little over all these types of movies but this one started off interesting enough and the more it went on the more interesting it was getting. Who doesn't like movies where they try to answer a unsolved mystery? About halfway through it started to get bizarre and the ending was so ridiculous that it ruined the movie. I don't want to give anything away but I am 100% positive that the explanation for the disappearance this movie comes up with is not right. I have no theory of my own, but it's not this one. Overall, a movie that started off interesting but started to go downhill and the ending is so out of nowhere that it ruins the movie. I give it a C.",1383868800,2,1234,4.513392857142857

5752186,3,B00CYMMSH0,"Ok, this is a found footage movie...if you don't like found footage, don't watch and better yet don't leave a bad review revolving around how much you don't like found footage movies.

Now for those who actually enjoy this genre, this movie might be for you. Being a found footage fan myself, I rank this movie as being somewhat average. For me, the characters didn't seem authentic or particularly likable. They were just a generic bunch lumped together for a predictable start to the movie. I chalk this up to a combination of not-so-great acting and poor writing. The only character I found remotely interesting was J.B. Hauser, but I really didn't feel anything for these characters.

What I do give the movie kudos for is the unique idea that is the ""scare"" in this movie. Without giving spoilers, I don't think I've ever seen that idea been done before, at least not in that way...definitely different from the ghosts, aliens, subterranean creatures and other monsters that we're used to seeing. It was not some mind-blowing twist for me, but I certainly appreciated the different idea which made me enjoy the movie more overall.

I'd say for anyone who enjoys this genre to give this movie a shot but maybe once the price goes down. It's not bad, but it's not really worthy of the current $6.99 rental price.",1380153600,,1315,4.7336244541484715

Camera flickering, lights flickering etc.  It's Blair Witch in the snowy mountains. I hate these ""camcorder"" type movies.  Why do they keep making them?  And with bad unknown actors. Of course everyone is saying no, no lets leave and of course there's one person that convinces them to stay and do research....so clich.

It is a very economic way to make movies as far as movies go, but that's no excuse to keep on doing the same, same story as ""Blair Witch Project"" did. I promised myself never to see another one of these new films again but I still don't read reviews before watching a film, which is risky in the sense that I stumble upon these little flicks of ""found footage but lost imagination"". The genera, which was not considered a genera started back in the  early 70's, with ""Cannibal Holocaust"" and several others more which were made by Italian filmmakers like Ruggero Deodato, keeping secrecy with the actors and crew, and even being processed by a judge because of the ""reality footage"" involved. It truly makes a better story than all these films that have tried to emulate Blair Witch. These new ones just don't make sense or bring something new to the table.

The group loosely mirrors the Scooby-Doo gang. The plot reminded me of ""Yellow Brick Road"" while the basic flow of the film was similar to ""Frankenstein Theory."" The film keeps you engaged by dropping hints and clues along the way as our group wildly speculate as to what happened. 40 minutes into the film they arrive at the camping spot with an hour of film left. Like ""Yellow Brick Road"" their electronic devices act up. Unlike ""Yellow Brick Road"" you actually get to know what happens as all the clues neatly come together in the end.

I found the film well done for the ""Found Footage"" genre. The storyline combined multiple films and ideas to give us a something on the unique side. Worth viewing, especially for fans of ""found footage: films. Oh yes, at the camp site they also have toast on a stick for you old Bud Melman fans.

I liked the overall concept of this movie - the filmmakers tried to tie together several paranormal tales, like Yetis and the Philadelphia experiment and aliens, etc., to keep you guessing. That part was good. What I wish they'd spent more time on was characterization - Holly, the girl who spearheads the journey to discover what happened to a group of hikers that disappeared fifty years earlier, is so annoying, shrieky, overwrought and obnoxious that I found it hard to care what happened to her or to any of them.

This flick certainly spoke to my fears in droves and in my opinion it was well-acted and thought out.  My only confusion was the 3 male leads all looked similar (especially with black snow climbing outfits) so I had to pay attention to the names being spoke to make certain of who was who.  No biggie - I really like this movie and it did hold my attention from start to finish.  I even paused it to refill drinks and snacks so I wouldn't miss any of it.

5752201,3,B00CYMMSH0,"Sci-fi is my preferred genre, but I also enjoy thriller/horror. The ""Devil's Pass"" teaser didn't leave me with high expectations - the wayward group of attractive youths lost in the woods/mountains theme is a weary device. However, the backdrop of college graduates filming a paranormal documentary by retracing the mysterious deaths in Russia of nine ski hikers from 1959 - the Dyatlov Pass Incident - piqued my interest and elevated the story. Thus, as the cinematography in the movie trailer looked decent (I can only tolerate so much ""Blair Witch"" or shaky camera antics), I took a risk on the rental. Glad I did so. Kind of reminds me of ""Outpost"" with some scenes, but not nearly as well done or detailed. That's ok, though.

The action begins slow, as the characters provide background on the real life event and then journey to the Ural Mountains. During this build-up phase, the writing was good enough to hold my attention - I was pleasantly surprised with the absence of stupid clich's, the characters were more developed (just enough to care if they live or die) and the foreboding hints that you are no longer in Kansas kept raising the ""creep"" factor. No one's going to win any acting awards, but the roles were well played for this low budget production. I also appreciated the Russian scenery and authenticity - most of the usual stereotypes were avoided and the language seemed to flow realistically.

Once the group reaches the location - the plot accelerates nicely and the unexpected story twists come at you fast. The ending left me thinking... as I tied the strings together. And while I'm ok with a story that relies on the unknown, I do feel that the final scenes would have benefitted from a bit more attention on the writing. Still, I was entertained for a ""B"" drama/sci-fi/horror tale. Overall, it squeaks into a 3 out of 5 stars.

Parental Guidance: The language is mild, and there's very little sexual content... but I would keep this at ""R"" due to the dialogue and horror/gore aspects.",1377734400,51,2015,4.7844827586206895
