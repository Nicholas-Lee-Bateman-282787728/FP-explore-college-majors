2926,4,0738920061,"We've seen virtually every Sesame Street video - some once, some many times.  This one is one of the most enjoyable.  We owned it for a long time, then my kids outgrew it - or so we thought!  They've asked to see it several times since we gave away our copy, so we keep getting it out of the library.  My kids are 7 and 10 now, and still asking!  We are particularly fond of 'Telly's Lunch' and the skit with Grover.  This is one of the really good Sesame Street videos - definitely worth the $ - only wish we'd kept our copy when we had a chance!  Four stars because nothing is better than Elmo's Sing Along Guessing Game, but this is VERY close.",1312416000,,647,4.087301587301587
2927,5,0738920061,"My 2 1/2 year old son and 1 1/2 year old daughter love watching this video!  It also contains fun references for the parents that the kids won't necessarily pick up on (i.e. Cereal Girl is a spoof on the song Material Girl).  We got this video to use as part of my son's food therapy - he has oral sensory issues and is extremely selective about what he will eat.  Time will tell if this helps with his food therapy, but it is definitely entertaining - he is already singing some of the songs and giggles when Grover acts silly.",1294531200,,528,4.207920792079208
2928,5,0738920061,"This Sesame DVD has to be my favourite! And believe me, we have them ALL. I love the songs, which will have you singing long after the dvd is over. Very cute skits and characters, Grover is very lovable. The underlying message is eating healthy but kids will enjoy the music and skits so much they won't notice there is a great message as well! We liked this so much that we bought it for my now 7 year old twins years ago and have now bought it again for my 2 year old.",1289865600,,470,4.01063829787234
2929,5,0738920061,"We love this video!
We watch it over and over again. My son has always been a picky eater and this video has truly helped him to venture into trying new foods.",1271894400,,159,4.0
2930,5,0738920061,"I enjoyed this video more than I thought I would.  I don't know what my daughter will think of it (she's too young to watch it now), but I really bought it for myself.  I grew up on Sesame Street and although this is not like the traditional Sesame Street, the same loveable characters are there.  I've always had an interest in food and especially love seeing talking, singing animated/puppet food -- this did not disappoint!  Grover tries to stress the importance of trying new foods and Cookie Monster has a rap song about vegetables (because he wants to be clear that one should not just eat cookies).  I liked it so much that I want to watch it again!",1248739200,2,656,4.433333333333334
2931,5,0738920061,"My daughter is only 9 months old, but on both occasions that we have watched it she immediately begins butt bouncing in excitement. The tunes are catchy (I LOVE CEREAL Girl!) and Its a throw back to classic sesame street for me.",1235347200,,228,4.4523809523809526
2932,5,0738920061,As they say in espanol  ESTUPENDO.  Great songs fabulous presentation and it works. Couldn't rate it highly enough. Lo Mejor  The other titles I have purchased were also of a high standard and most enjoyable.,1171238400,2,208,4.885714285714286
2933,3,0738920061,"There's some parts of the video that is really entertaining, but also had a lot of filler stuff that didn't really get my daughter's attention.  For the most part, I'd say this one is OK.",1127865600,,187,4.3428571428571425
2934,5,0738920061,"As a mom, this is one of my favorite Sesame Street videos and my two-year-old also loves it. Grover is my favorite character and I bought the video because Grover is featured on the cover. I love Grover's interactions with the ""blue man"" ...they are so funny. Along with Grover and the ""blue man"", there are great songs and videos of children eating and playing. Some of our favorites are... ""blueberry mouths"" and ""cereal girl"" . Excellent video!!",1112918400,6,448,4.756410256410256
2935,3,0738920061,"Remeber Grover the Waiter and his chubby blue customer?  This video is a great chance to visit them again - Grover has ""worked his way up in the food business"" to become a Planet Storybook (read Hollywood) waiter and change the unhealthy eating habits of his favorite customer.  Along the way are lots of gags about storybook characters (Grover trips over Jack Be Nimble's candlestick, for instance - and the restaurant is decorated with memorobilia like Cinderella's glass slipper)  Very cute.
I think I'm not cool enough to enjoy the song clips, but if you and your kids enjoy spoofs, you'll like them: ""Cereal Girl,""  Cookie monster rapping about ""Healthy Food,"" and bologna, cheese, and bread singing ""Telly's Lunch"" (Brady Bunch Theme) I liked ""Blueberry Mouth,"" a Leon Redbone style (?) tune about blueberry picking.
I don't know that it made any difference in eating behavior with my son, but he's a pretty good eater anyway.  He enjoyed it, though: particularly the singing broccholi.",1045094400,9,992,5.024390243902439
7788265,1,0738920061,"Great video, bad product. The disc had been ""cleaned"" with one of the disc cleaners, so it took forever to work, when it does play all the way through, it's a video. Otherwise, very, very disappointed",1504224000,,200,4.583333333333333

Kudos to Sesame street for producing this quality video promoting healthy eating. I have even purchased this for my job in health promotion.  I would highly recommend this one.
