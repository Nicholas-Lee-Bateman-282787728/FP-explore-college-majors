6251156,5,B00I4X8KXY,Very good action and suspense---a little bad towards the end as one seal battles the whole town and shoots everybody without being shot.,1397347200,2,136,4.956521739130435
6251157,1,B00I4X8KXY,Only reason I watched the whole movie is because I had to pay for it.  I hate watching these unrealistic seal movies!,1397260800,2,117,4.318181818181818
6251158,1,B00I4X8KXY,The last 10 to 20 minutes of the movie is totally unbelievable. You got the lead character fighting his way through a town full of ak47 wielding residents.....one man with a 9mm beretta against a hailstorm of ak47 ammo.....,1397088000,2,223,4.743589743589744
6251159,2,B00I4X8KXY,"It is not a quality movie, the acting, backdrop, and the language, was terrible. The used of profanity was way over the top, there is a time and place for everything. The movie does not do well for US Armed Forces or the members, past and present. The Navy or DoD should not allow Titles of actual units. This is a no-go, a dud!!!!!",1397001600,,332,4.203125
6251160,1,B00I4X8KXY,"This is terrible movie that has all the sophistication of a Saturday morning cartoon.  It looks like they threw this piece of crap together in about three weeks; undoubtedly to quickly cash in on the success of Lone Survivor.  It's an insult to anyone who has movie quality standards. Even worse, it's an insult to the guys who fought and died for this country.  Their actions should not be exploited and twisted into a such a joke of a movie.",1396656000,5,443,4.5125
6251161,2,B00I4X8KXY,The plot wasn't bad but it's execution was very poor indeed. Action sequences weren't bad. Acting was subpar. Was so bad I actually never finished it.,1396656000,4,150,4.8076923076923075
6251162,2,B00I4X8KXY,"""The boys in Washington cried wolf about this African yellowcake before and we both know how that turned out."" When a small team of S.E.A.L.S uncover intelligence about a sale of weapons grade uranium they are taken by surprise. The team isn't prepared and has no support coming. With only 36 hours left before the deal takes place the team must use all their training and skills to make their way to the site and stop the transaction or the US will be in danger. I will say that I liked the first Behind Enemy Lines but wasn't all that impressed with the other two. This one was a struggle for me to get through. I wasn't expecting anything close to Act of Valor but when you make a movie about Navy S.E.A.L.S. you should at least try to make them S.E.A.L. like. The action was so bad it made the movie almost unwatchable. When you reach the 4th movie in a series that means you usually go one too many. For example...Indy 4 was the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, Leprechaun was in space, Batman 4 was Batman and Robin and technically Star Wars 4 was the Phantom Menace...this movie joins that list as possible franchise killers. Overall, a movie that is hoping that the Behind Enemy Lines title is enough to carry it...it's not. I give this a C-.",1395964800,11,1247,4.402597402597403

6251169,3,B00I4X8KXY,This movie has action however some of it was not to believable. It lost me about halfway through so I will watch it again on a rainy day when I'm really bored.,1419724800,,159,4.0
6251170,5,B00I4X8KXY,"I've rated this movie 5***** which is probably higher than it deserves, but really, it is a good military, action flick.  Sadly, the worst scenes are the ones with Tom Sizemore in them.  The rest of the cast do a good job, considering the amount of ammo expended.  This movie has a hostage rescue, which includes a massive firefight, a boat chase, and drones hitting targets while being guided by a couple of ""gamers"".  The dialogue is weak, the story is predictable, but it is still entertaining and worth a look.",1416355200,,514,4.615384615384615

6251176,1,B00I4X8KXY,"Hollywood is Hollywood and B movies are B movies, but you can't turn everyone off at the beginning.  You have to assume most people have heard of SEALS by now and you have to make an attempt at wardrobe.  Everyone in the military does not wear the same insignias and the Navy SEALS do not wear Air Force patches.  You take an improbable mission with an impossible finale - one man with a hand gun who never misses against a whole city armed with AK-47's, missiles and machetes who can't hit the broad side of a barn.  I mean come on, they even stretched out the scene with explosions and everything and still not one person got in a lucky shot.  Even a blind pig finds an acorn once in a while.  Then he has a big fight scene with a woman who holds her own for a bit.  Good hand to hand training.  Unless your into just random shooting continuously you might skip this one.",1410393600,2,873,4.216867469879518

6251178,3,B00I4X8KXY,We bought this movie on the chance it would entertain us for an evening. It did just that. Nothing new here but basically well done action that keeps your attention for an hour or two. I believe Amazon had the Blu-Ray discounted nicely making it a good deal.,1407196800,,258,4.395833333333333

6251180,2,B00I4X8KXY,The producers of this movie desperately need to hire a new technical advisor before the make any other military movies. Lots of liberties were taken especially with uniforms.,1403827200,2,174,5.25

6251182,2,B00I4X8KXY,"The premise of Seal team 8 is to track a seal mission into the African Congo, to hit a uranium mine, and stop our most dangerous villiain from smuggling weapon's grade yellow-cake out of the country. Unfortunately the premise does not translate to the film.

This is an under whelming attempt at a war movie, directed by Roel Rein - known for his  work in direct-to-video productions evidenced by some of the shooting techniques.

Top billing goes to an over the top, curmudgeonly, Tom Sizemore. He stomps around within the small confines of a one-room command center overseeing the SEAL team with help via a Predator drone which was interesting to watch.  However I have not YET figured out yet what could less capably show, intelligent military leadership than a man who has been in and out of the revolving rehab door more times than Sizemore?  He is however to credit, the best actor in this muddle. He yells, stomps, shouts, and barks like an angry dog ""we have a got situation here"" over his charges in a washed out script that only provides war action/suspense to someone who may never have viewed a well crafted war epic with interest, suspense and credible story.

The co-stars are questionable as they set out for fun in the sun of Africa, where they shout out ridiculous lines and cause various objects to explode. The editor adds effect (not sure why) by speeding up and slowing footage down, and adding background music of  hip-hop music. (Sam Pepkinpah practically pioneered slo-mo action in  shooting and falling death scenes to great effect) but the folks behind this were not in that league, that ballpark, or city.

Seal Team 8 ""may"" be the ""norm"" for action movies (except for the hip hop)  but, at least decent war productions benefit from actual actors who can act, directors who can direct and scripts that can be better than this.

Premise of Seal Team 8 seems to be ""boys with toys"" running around, blowing stuff up and getting gutted by RPGs. They did not project the image of SEALS. On the upside, the crew actually exploded tangible items with ordinance without relying on too much CGI.

The film provides little to take you into it or make it worth the time it takes to watch.  This is some guerilla war so the bad guys should be somewhat of a mystery but we are given little to know who they are. One of the leaders was almost commical. A bad cartoon clich. For some, the most attention getting part may have been a gaggle of semi -nude women near the beginning of the film.

Unlike some of the real explosions in the picture, Seal Team 8 lacks bang. It is like the pin that falls out of the grenade and nothing happens. Hey Sarge.....this thing is a dud!!!!

I can not reccommend this film as a good take on the war movie genre. There are great war films out there but this was not one.

As one reviewer on here said,  it has the ""sophistication of a saturday morning cartoon""  except it wasn't funny.

War is frightening yes,  but even more frightening is that they could make another sequel.

Save your money.

2 stars for nice try.",1400630400,5,3064,4.563071297989031
6251183,1,B00I4X8KXY,"This movie must have cost at least ten thousand dollars to make.  Felt like I was watching an old episode of The A-Team.  I got this at a Redbox for $1.25 and feel ripped off.  The story was as pathetic as the acting. Trust me, don't waste your time on this.",1399852800,2,258,4.019607843137255
6251184,2,B00I4X8KXY,Movie was disappointing but enjoy the subject matter.  Story and acting were inadequate and do not recommend buying this movie.,1399420800,,127,5.35
6251185,4,B00I4X8KXY,Plenty of action. The movie gives a good portrayal of what Seals do to keep America and its allies safe and secure.,1399161600,,115,4.2727272727272725
6251186,2,B00I4X8KXY,"While in the Congo saving informant Zoe Jelani (Aurlie Meriel) Seal Team 8 uncovers a secret uranium mine operation and unknown Farsi speaking buyer. The film then piles on more improbable aspects to create a second rate story that didn't begin to get interesting until there was less than a half hour left.

First we have the Bush-Cheney fantasy that tons of uranium can be mined and then transported without anyone noticing it. Then Team 8 has no back up. Nope, not even for yellow cake. Drone friendly fire-oops. It also took them several days to figure out that Zoe, who killed the general who was about to spill his guts about her and knows too much, may be something else. Who didn't see that coming? Villages dying from radiation poisoning from working in uranium mines...seriously? And when the general ask the girls to dance, they had zero rhythm.

The plot had holes you could fly a drone through. The dialogue was slightly better. There is plenty of mindless action done to a hip-hop sound track that seemed out of place. Not recommended.

F-bomb, sex, nudity (Aurlie Meriel  + swimming pool extras)",1398816000,5,1110,4.765625
6251187,1,B00I4X8KXY,"i must have seen a movie worse than this one but can't remember what. the stink in this movie wasn't limited, it was spread equally.

action scenes without any dialogue or with breaks, they pumped in the really annoying elevator music like you would expect to hear in a 1940's roy rogers western while he was on is fancy horse chasing after bad guys.

it's all a bunch of senseless shooting and killing and stupid dialogue; complete nonsense and really amateur like editing, and directing, and acting, etc...",1398816000,3,508,4.761363636363637
6251188,1,B00I4X8KXY,"I have not watched this, nor will I. Why? Strictly by judging this movie by its cover. Seal teams are not apart of the Air Force's Air Combat Command, which is the patch this ""seal"" is wearing on his sleeve. Don't even get me started as to the incorrectness of the patch even being on the sleeve. I wish more military film makers would take the small details a bit more seriously when it comes to this type of s***.",1398729600,4,415,4.2
6251189,3,B00I4X8KXY,"There is plenty of action, a small squad of US seals takes on an army in a story that gets more unbelievable as it gets on. Cannot anyone shoot straight against these seals?  A guy with a handgun beats many guys armed with submachine guns and grenade launchers?  After a while, it just starts getting too much.

The acting is okay. I did like Tom Sizemore performance.

The action scenes are alright.

6251192,1,B00I4X8KXY,This film does NOT do any justice to the U.S. Navy Seals. The plot is surreal and quite unbelievable. Whoever dreamed this script up was very desperate to get another movie out that capitalizes on the name of United States Seals.,1397520000,2,229,4.609756097560975

8639300,1,B00I4X8KXY,"Overacting and an obvious LOW budget. I should have just stopped watching it early in the movie when I saw (plain as day) that the ""SEAL"" firing the machine gun was firing a belt full of blanks.
