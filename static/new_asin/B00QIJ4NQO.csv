6870769,5,B00QIJ4NQO,"...and yet I have only watched the first episode, courtesy of YouTube!  When will this tasty little BBC gem of one-upsmanship (womanship, more like) and comedy of manners be released in American DVD format?  Please, make it soon!",1431388800,9,229,5.0
8691408,1,B00QIJ4NQO,"It's awful. This kind of Brit period comedy needs charming comic performers with perfect timing, and warmth, and Miranda Richardson and Anna Chancellor don't tick any of the boxes. Miranda Richardson, as usual overacts to a level that is close to incomprehensible babbling hysteria, and the two of them have zero chemistry together. It's amazingly bad.",1525046400,,352,5.303571428571429
8691409,4,B00QIJ4NQO,"Yes, it's a little over the top......but there are lots of my favorite British actors in it.
I found it to be a fun romp.

Some say it can't compare with the Scales/McEwan series, but as much as I enjoyed that version it became tedious at times too.",1517616000,,249,4.1875

8691411,1,B00QIJ4NQO,"It was from the UK and unplayable on our USA DVD's .. tried to return it, but would have cost me even more money to return.  Very upset that it was not clear this would not play on USA players.  Some code or other prevented playing. If it becomes available on something playable in the USA i would love to see it.",1487635200,2,313,4.032258064516129
8691412,3,B00QIJ4NQO,"Trying to get past my expectations from the books and the 1980's series.  This series is certainly beautiful to look at and I don't regret buying the DVD (using my laptop to watch the PAL format version), but at the moment I feel a bit disappointed.  I absolutely adored Geraldine McEwan and am missing her magic.  Maybe that's my problem.  Any true Mapp & Lucia fan will want to have this version anyway.  As I said, I'm glad I have it.",1472342400,6,437,4.345679012345679

8691414,5,B00QIJ4NQO,"I know the Mapp and Lucia books by heart and have seen the earlier series many times on VHS/DVD. This adaptation is wonderful! The writer has folded the pre ""Mapp and Lucia"" books in seamlessly. Integrating the Guru, Crimson Lake/Kingfisher Blue etc into the M&L rivalry. Miranda Richardson totally nails Mapp- a fresher version of Prunella Scales. And Anna Chancellor is a more modern (in the 1930's sense) Lucia than Geraldine McEwan. All in all a stellar entertainment which will delight any E. F. Benson fan. I do hope they film the rest of the books. I bought an all regions DVD player simply to watch this and it was a good investment.",1446336000,9,641,4.68141592920354

8691416,5,B00QIJ4NQO,"being a fan of the old series, it started out a difficult remake, recalling the iconic actors from the original, but after a while, my wife and i came to quite enjoy it, and are looking forward to a continuation of the original story in a hopefully, subsequent release.",1442620800,6,269,4.510204081632653
8691417,5,B00QIJ4NQO,"I was fortunate enough to see this entire series. I enjoyed it thoroughly. It stays faithful to the novels of E. M. Benson about Mapp & Lucia. These are two middle aged women who live in an English village by the sea, Tilling. It is set in the period of time between the two World Wars. Each of these women wants to be the Queen Bee of Tilling so they are in a state of constant battle readiness to assume that role over the other. Mapp was the Queen of Tilling until Lucia moved there from the town where she was Queen. There are a whole host of other delightful characters who surround these two. The actors do a great job in every role. It is hard for me to imagine that any hard core Mapp and Lucia fan would not want to see this.

There are such lovers of this work, including myself, that we all are going to compare this with the series of Benson novels as well as with the earlier tv series made in the 1980s. The novels and that earlier series were solid As. This is just as solid but you have got to put the earlier series out of your mind. If you start comparing the two while watching this one, you will not enjoy it.

It is a particularly rough task to compare Miranda Richardson, who now plays Mapp, with Prunella Scales who played her in the earlier show. They are both formidable in the role and it is probably the tougher role of the two. Mapp has mostly unlikable qualities straight across the board so it is harder for an actor to make her work comedically. But these two actors manage it.

Actors Geraldine McEwan vs. Anna Chancellor as Lucia: that is a draw in my estimation. I found both of their interpretations of Lucia just fine. Lucia has been illustrated for the books as either a red head or a brunette so that Chancellor's dark hair and McEwan's red hair make little difference to the character.

Steve Pemberton takes over the Georgie Pillson role from Nigel Hawthorne. I just loved Hawthorne as Pillson so that is very hard for me. Pemberton does an awfully good job nevertheless.

One thing this series does that the other did not is that it apparently is taking on all of the books or more of them than the 1980s series did. We have the guru from ""Queen Lucia"" in this series which we did not get in the earlier one. The writers simply transposed the action to Tilling and have Mapp and Lucia battling over the guru rather than Lucia and Daisy. I don't think anything is lost with that minor adaptation to the original novel. This way we also get to meet Georgie's sisters who are really something.

There must be another series planned because they certainly did not cover all of the novels in this first season.",1440547200,10,2646,4.346153846153846
