2249118,5,B0007Y08P6,No problem letting the kids watch these.  Absolutely best television show ever on the air.  DVD's worth every last penny.,1115164800,8,121,5.0
2249119,5,B0007Y08P6,"The Andy Griffith Show, of course, is one of the greatest sitcoms ever made.  While, I do not think most of the season 2 episodes are near their best, almost anything from this classic series (not including Mayberry RFD) is worth owning. Season 2 does offer Andy Griffith's favorite: The Pickle Story. Here is a brief summary of the 30+ episodes in this season:

Opie & the Bully: A tough kid keeps taking Opie's milk money.  Andy helps Opie brave taking a punch to the eye with good humor (with a little patriotism thrown in for good measure).  A little sugary.

Barney's Replacement: Barney thinks Andy is grooming anew man (Bob Rogers played by Mark Miller) to replace him as deputy.

Andy & the Woman Speeder: A pretty and charming big city lady (played by Jean Hagen) gets a speeding ticket and thinks she can outsmart the small town sheriff.

Mayberry Goes Bankrupt:  The town people are shocked when they find out they owe the downtrodden resident with the eye-sore shack a ton of money.

Barney on the Rebound: A pretty young con artist and her husband try to swindle Barney in a breech of promise suit.  Highlight: Barney giving the young, female stranger a police escort to the post office (just across the street) in front of a jealous Thelma Lou.

Opie's Hobo Friend: A ne'er-do-well vagrant played by Buddy Ebsen is a bad influence on Opie.

Crime-Free Mayberry: Andy and Barney are honored for achieving the lowest crime rate in the nation.  Meanwhile, the Mayberry bank is being burgled.

The Perfect Female: Thelma Lou tries to set Andy up with her cousin-a champion skeet shooter.

Aunt Bee's Brief Encounter: Aunt Bee falls for a traveling handyman and old codger Henry Wheeler.  Andy steps in before Aunt Bee gets hurt.

The Clubmen: Andy and Barney are guests at a meeting of the Esquire club, but only one of them is invited to join.  One of the many cases where Andy does practically anything to spare his friend's feelings.

The Pickle Story: This episode is Andy Griffith's favorite.  Aunt Bee is bent on beating Clara in a homemade pickle contest, but her family is afraid to tell her they taste like kerosene.

Sheriff Barney: Barney gets an offer to become the sheriff of Greendale, so Andy lets Barney be sheriff of Mayberry so he will get a taste of what it is like.

The Farmer Takes a Wife: Farmer Jeff Pruitt comes to town in search of a bride and fall for Thelma Lou (much to Barney's chagrin).

Keeper of the Flame: The meeting place of Opie's secret club burns down.

Bailey's Bad Boys: A spoiled, rich young man ends up in the Mayberry jail and expects his father to bail him out.  He then sees Andy forcing Opie to stand on his own two feet and begins to question his sense of responsibility.

The Manicurist: A beautiful young lady (played by Barbara Eden) sets up a manicure booth in Floyd's barber shop and the wives of Mayberry are outraged when they see their husbands lined up to be customers.

The Jinx: After a series of mishaps, Henry Bennett gets a reputation in town as a jinx. The more Andy tries to dispel the rumor the deeper the hole gets. Eventually, Henry decides it would be best if left town altogether causing the townspeople to reconsider their unsympathetic attitude.

Jailbreak: The state police bring a rough prisoner to Mayberry who is soon broken out of jail by his girlfriend on Barney's watch.

A Medal for Opie: Opie is confident he will win a medal for a race.  When he loses, Andy must teach him a lesson in sportsmanship.

Barney and the Choir:  Barney can't sing a lick [but no one dares tell him].  Andy solves the problem by convincing Barney he will sing his solo in a super sensitive microphone that he blast his voice unless he sings below a whisper.

Guest of Honor: The folks of Mayberry pick the first out-of-state driver to be the guest of honor on Founder's Day.  Of course, the guest turns out to be a convicted pick-pocket.

The Merchant of Mayberry: Andy and Barney help traveling salesman Bert Miller to set up a stand next to the local department store that is owned by the scrooge-like Ben Weaver.

Aunt Bee the Warden: The Mayberry jail is filled with moonshiners so Otis must serve his time at the Taylor's with a ruthless warden.

The County Nurse: Nurse Mary Simpson is trying to get all the farmers inoculated but the ring leader, Rafe Hollister, refuses.  Andy then uses a little reverse psychology by praising Hollister as a martyr for the cause against protecting one's self from rusty saws.

Andy and Barney in the Big City: While staying in Raleigh, Barney believes he is witnessing a man casing the hotel. Of course, Barney tails a man that turns out to be the house detective.

Wedding Bells for Aunt Bee: Clara convinces Aunt Bee that Andy is not getting married because he does not want to leave her alone.  Desperate for a suitor, Bee sets her sites on the unkempt dry cleaner Fred Goss. This episode marks one of the very few times Opie's mother is mentioned.

Three's a Crowd: One of the favorites. Andy explains to the ever-present Barney that he wants to be alone with new flame Mary. Barney, of course, concludes that Andy is planning to propose [how often did this happen in the series?] and organizes a party.

The Bookie Barber: A barber from Raleigh sets up shop in Floyd's shop.  Andy becomes suspicious when he notices the new barber always serving the same three customers.

Andy on Trial: A reporter hired to dig up dirt on Andy poses as a college student and Barney, trying to impress her, spouts about how poorly run the sheriff's office is and how much better job he would do.

Cousin Virgil: Barney's cousin is a clutz.  Barney tries to build Virgil's confidence by giving him tasks. When Virgil keeps failing, Barney gives up.  Leave it to Andy to discover Virgil's true abilities.

Deputy Otis: Otis has been writing his brother and sister-in-law using courthouse stationery while serving his drunken weekends in the jail.  When they decide to pay him a visit, Otis gets Andy and Barney to let him pose as a deputy.",1113868800,150,6035,4.614446529080675
2249120,5,B0007Y08P6,"One of the most beloved shows in television history, The Andy Griffith Show takes its viewers back to a simpler time of small town America, apple pie, and black and white television... The trademark whistling theme song is one of the most recognizable in history, and the duration of the show in syndicated reruns is unrivaled by its peers.

The Andy Griffith Show follows the exploits of the small town of Mayberry and its family values, no nonsense sheriff Andy. Widowed, and father to a small boy named Opie (Ron Howard), Andy is joined in Mayberry by his sidekick Deputy Barney Fife, his relative and housekeeper Aunt Bee (Frances Bavier), and a host of other eccentric characters.

But the show stealer is Barney Fife (Don Knotts) who plays the role of a sometimes incompetent, kooky deputy always in over his head. The onscreen dynamic between Griffith and Knotts is truly magical. Both men would go on to heralded careers in show business with Knotts starring in numerous roles, such as Mr. Furley on Three's Company, and Griffith as the title star of Matlock. Ron Howard (Opie) would go on to establish himself as one of Hollywood's most well-known directors...

The Andy Griffith Show (Season 2) DVD features a number of hilarious episodes including the season premiere ""Opie and the Bully"" in which a fellow schoolboy torments Opie, forcing Andy to give some fatherly advice... Other notable episodes include ""Barney's Replacement"" in which Barney comes to believe that Andy is grooming his replacement, and ""Sheriff Barney"" in which Barney is offered the job of sheriff by a rival township (a job he declines following Andy's offer to let Barney be Mayberry's sheriff for a day)... The season concludes with ""Deputy Otis,"" an episode in which the town drunk Otis (because he's written letters to his family on County stationary) has led his family to believe that he's a deputy in Mayberry...

2249121,5,B0007Y08P6,"**About the forced commercials on Disc One: On my DVD remote I merely pressed the >>I (next) button and skipped them one by one, it takes a couple of seconds but is able to be bypassed by my player. Hitting the MENU or FF won't do the trick though. Another easy way is if your DVD player has a ""Last Memory"" button; just before an episode ends or during the theme credits press Last Memory, and then turn the DVD player OFF. When you press ""On"" again, the player will resume at the end credits and from there you can select Menu:)**

This is when the series (almost) begins for me. I love the first season don't get me wrong (4 stars), but they seemed to try a bit too hard with the accents and the characters were just finding themselves, but I guess that's the way it's supposed to be. Then in Season 2 they ease the accents, the characters begin to form and all is almost there. This season has many more episodes I consider ""classic"" or ""near classic"" but we are not quite up to the Helen Crump ""era"" and to me THAT is the Andy I love.

Solid, solid, solid. I found many of my favorite episodes here and with this series in general center around Barney, many but not all. In later seasons, Gomer and Goober came along to fill some of the spaces but early on most of the humor fell onto Don Knotts who amply filled this area. Only a handful of the episodes in Season Two were flat or were over-wrought like the Alan Hale ""Farmer"" ep. or the unquestionably unlikely ""Guest of Honor"" episode. Still, to say this is a must have is an understatement as it is so nice to see the TAGS (30-45 second conclusions) of so many of these episodes that were long ago cut to sell you more of what you didn't need, not to mention the packaging which once again is just perfect. I could have done without the commercials on Disc One, but Paramount is a business I guess and as far as extra's the promo ""ads"" are ""interesting"" but repetitive.

Just remember, when Season 3 hits is when this series hits full steam, so buckle up!! ""That's CRUMP! C-R-U-M-P!""-Helen",1113264000,221,3211,4.7064056939501775

2249124,5,B0007Y08P6,"Hot dog, the second season is coming out May 24. My favorite episodes are ""Opie & the Bully"", ""The Clubmen"", ""The Pickle Story"",and ""Barney & the Choir"". However to me, this is the weakest of the 5 Black & white seasons(although it's still great). I think season 3 is the strongest. Season 3 introduced us to Ernest T. Bass,the Darlings,Gomer Pyle,the Fun Girls , and Helen. It also has many of my favorite episodes overall--""Convicts at Large"",""The Bed Jacket""(touching), ""Barney & the Governor""(Barney rivals Foster Brooks when he gets sauced),""Barney""s First Car"", ""Dogs,Dogs,Dogs"", and ""The Big House""(Rule#1, obey all rules).Can""t wait for all the black & white seasons to come out so I can finally see them in all their uncut glory.

2249163,5,B0007Y08P6,"I assume that this being the second season, that you now know what you have bought. Now you are ready for episodes 33 through 63. I also assume that you did not get your fix with just the first season.

For those people who are buying the second season before viewing the first, the Andy Griffith Show is unique in a sense that it started out fun and had all the standard encounters and stories that most TV programs had but it never deteriorate or got so left field as to lose its appeal. Every show is entertaining and usually carries a message.

A lot of other programs spun off form the characters that played in this series. And you always think that Opie Taylor (Ronny Howard) is always young. Everyone knows that they issued Deputy Barney fife ""1960-1965"" (Don Knotts) one bullet that has seen a lot of action in his pocket. Too many people to name here.

2249403,5,B0007Y08P6,"As one who grew up watching Andy Griffith, I thoroughly enjoy watching the first five season again ... and again.  It just never seems to get old.  I never really cared for the series after Don Knotts.  The magic in the show seemed to be a chemistry between Andy Griffith and Don Knotts that is quite rare.  Watching these episodes brings much laughter - it is no wonder that Don Knotts won several Emmys during his time on the series.  But the episodes also bring several tender moments.

There are many life lessons taught through these episodes, including the ever present theme of ""believe in others.""  In a world of TV today that seeks to tear down, destroy, ridicule and rule over others, a show where the main character spends time defending and protecting his bumbling sidekick, sometimes laying his own reputation on the line, is amazing.  And when Andy saved Barney's bacon and solved the problem, Andy would almost always give the credit publicly to Barney.  Not sure you'd see that in too many sitcoms today.  You can watch this show and feel good when its done.

The lessons for raising children should not go unnoticed. In one episode Andy gets upset with Opie who gets very mad at others because Opie did not win a race and is a ""sore loser.""  Andy teaches Opie that it's not about losing, but how you react that is more important.  Contrast that to what we teach kids today - everyone is a winner, everyone gets a trophy - there are no winners.  In today's world of finding someone else to take the blame or helping others find a way not to take responsibility, this series stands in stark contrast.  It teaches us to own our mistakes and failings while understanding it's not the end of the world and moving forward with the support of others.

It's amazing how much my young grand daughter enjoys watching Andy Griffith.  She enjoys the sophisticated kids shows of today, but she will ask if she can watch Andy Griffith, and then sit entranced by the show.

The quality of these DVDs is great, especially considering the technology that was used to originally record them.",1479600000,4,2090,4.617886178861789

The local folks are often mean to strangers, pickle competitions get personal, Barney's always suspecting people of committing crimes and is often talking about seeing other women while expecting Thelma Lou to be completely devoted to just him. And then there's Andy who often doesn't believe Opie (who always tells the truth), is frequently insensitive to his girlfriends (who keep changing), and is always picking on Barney in mean ways. It's also a very confusing town where neighbor Bertha becomes Clara in later shows, old Ben sells liquor at his store but then we find it's a dry county in later shows, Andy and Barney are cousins in the first two episodes (Season 1) but after that they're unrelated, Otis the drunk redeems himself in a few shows only to be a drunk again in the following episodes, businesses come and go, the size of the town seems to change, and many other inconsistencies.

On the other hand, there are also some good stories mixed in with the confusing ones and we are continuing with Season 3.",1474848000,,1052,4.78021978021978

Ron Howard's education in show business was from working on this show with Andy Griffith. The only real irritant is Don Knotts, who just grates on my nerves. His character's hubris and dopiness is supposed to serve as a foil to Sheriff Andy, I suppose, but I still can't like him. Most of the gentle humor still works, and sometimes I need to watch people being good to other people after so much so-called entertainment involving arterial blood and vicious connivance.",1445558400,,624,4.9523809523809526

I have been a prime member for several years now, and these shows were only available for purchase or rental. I own the Amazon Fire TV, as well.

Includes many favorite episodes such as the ""Pickle Story"", the second season is a must watch for the guest stars alone. Which include:Edgar Buchanan, Sterling Holloway, Bill Bixby, Buddy Ebson, Michael Pollard, and many more. I bought this season a few years back and still enjoy watching it today. Also, for the first of two seasons we get the original sponsor spots. Which are original commercials worked into the show to make the show longer. Some of them are pretty funny, and all of them are interesting. As a 17 year old, I can attest to the value of The Andy Griffith Show. It certainly resonates with all age groups.
ALSO: I've seen some reviews about people having trouble skipping the commercials on the first disc. I've never had that trouble in the three years I've owned it. Watched that disc about five or six times by the way.",1410220800,2,911,4.658385093167702

My wife, 10 years younger than me, did not key in to the significance until well into our marriage and has since become an ""Andyhead"".  It is truly wild to see it in perfect order on Amazon Prime.

2250478,5,B0007Y08P6,"I am a huge Andy Griffith Show fan. The series itself was simply great TV.

Andy Griffith himself had a bad reputation as being a mean, hateful man with a bad temper. As a matter of fact, there are two episodes in this season, ""Aunt Bee the Warden"" and ""the County Nurse"" in which Andy's hand is heavily bandaged. This was explained away as Andy having a brief ""tussel"" apprehending the Gordon boys, but in reality, Andy put his fist through a wall in his home in a fit of rage.

Andy and Aunt Bee never got along in real life but none of this ever influenced the show.

I would recommend this season to anyone who is a fan of nostalgic TV.

I personally own all of the Andy Griffith seasons and love them all.",1403049600,,710,4.198529411764706

Growing-up in a small town in TN, I relate strongly to the characters in this show, its stories and the morality this show reflects. When I watch it, it is like going home again. Although I moved with my family to a large metropolitan city in the North long ago (and have remained there) I tell people: ""one day I am going to live in Mayberry and be the sheriff."" I cannot think of a nicer place to live.

Almost every episode teaches you a life's lesson. The characters do it in a way that is neither preachy, or in your face. This is one of the rare TV programs that (for me) is consistently both funny and heartwarming. If you enjoy this program as much as I do, then please visit Mt Airy NC., Andy Griffith's birthplace. Every year they hold ""Mayberry Days"" to honor Andy, the show and the rest of those wonderful characters.

The characters are imperfect and all make mistakes, but mostly learn from them. It's not at all a preachy show, just one demonstrating how humans can work together to solve problems that arise.

Watching the show fresh with adult eyes, I thought the shows were much better than I remembered. The main actors were more mature and skilled than T.V. shows now, where everyone is relatively young and good looking.  They had more character actors back then.  Therefore, I feel the shows could have more depth than current shows, because the actors were more skilled, not less depth as is commonly thought.

(42) The Clubmen
(43) The Pickle Story
(48) The Manicurist
(52) Barney and the Choir
(57) Andy and Barney in the Big City

Season 2 has a couple of `clinkers' and a smattering of mediocre episodes, just enough to cost it a star.  That said, this is still one of the four top seasons of one of the best TV shows ever.

If you're going to collect them, I recommend seasons of `Andy' in this order: 4, 3, 5, 2, 1, 7, 8 and 6.  There's a noticeable drop off in overall quality after season 5.

2250661,4,B0007Y08P6,"It has been a very pleasant experience watching the first two seasons of THE ANDY GRIFFITH SHOW. The comedy tends to focus on the foibles of humanity, and has at times broke me up into guffaws of laughter. Don Knotts is simply priceless as the bombastic, bumbling Barney Fife, and Andy Griffiths provides an apt 'straight man'to his antics. In short, the initial three seasons of THE ANDY GRIFFITHS SHOW provide good, innocent humour in the setting of small town North America which was so prevalent in the early 1960's. As for the seasons after #3, I personally will be taking a pass, since I recall them as a gallery featuring rural rubes such as ""Gomer Pyle"" & ""Guber"", who serve as the butt of laughter at their odd personalities.",1350950400,,734,4.653846153846154

She has been looking for one particular episode forever and I finally got a little weary of hearing her trying to catch it on tv (she even called the tv station to see when it would air during a marathon), so I got smart and ordered the whole darn season.  It brings my Mom joy (Ok, I love them too), so everyone's a winner!  I know I can get her Season 1 and she would be thrilled as well.

2250665,5,B0007Y08P6,"I was born and raised in Germany and still live there. But in 2007 I got the chance to go to the U.S. for four years to work there for my company.

One day I was zapping through the channels and suddenly I stopped because I thought I had just seen ""Matlock"" as a young man. There he was, Andy Griffith in black and white and sooooo young. I wondered because in Germany he is only known as Matlock, who is grey-haired and old already. The Andy Griffith Show has never been published (aired) in Germany or anywhere in Europe as far as I know. I did't know that Andy Griffith had a career before ""Matlock"".

I was done zapping and watched The Andy Griffith Show for a while and I really liked it. Soon I set up my VCR to record all episodes. I was simply hooked! Of couse I bought all my favorite 5 seasons over Amazon already, I really don' t like the colored ones and I miss Barney there, just isn't the same anymore. I wonder if Don Knotts ever regret to part from the show?

I find it amazing that I became such a huge fan, I mean I didn't grow up in the States, I don't know anything about the Sixties and the American lifestyle and mentality back then, but to me it is the most wonderful tv - series for the whole family, a treasure, just timeless! I would move right into Mayberry if I could!

My stay in the U.S. was in the South so I got used to the accent very well, however I cannot share my obsession for this tv - show with anyone of my friends or family here in Germany because the Southern accent is just too difficult to understand for them and there is no German language (synchronisation) available and never will be. I understand about 90 % of what they are saying and I wish there would be subtitles available since we don't have CC in Germany. At least then I would be able to read the words that I don't understand and then get the meaning or look them up.

So you guys here are the only ones who understand my passion!

Unfortunately, Andy Griffith died last week, so I guess only Ron Howard is left.

  '''' R.i. P. Andy Griffith ''''

and thanks for hours and hours of your everlasting and never dying work that (now thanks to Paramount) will be in our living rooms as long as we live!

In less than 10 seconds we were watching the 1st episode!  No, the Menu button will not bypass them but the ""Next"" button certainly will!

The flaw was on the program called ""Opies's Hobo Friend"" toward the end of the show.  The DVD stopped running completely and we had to start all over which was time consuming because there is about 10 minutes of preliminary Ads for other
progams such as the Brady Bunch, etc.  The 2nd time we ran the DVD there was a momentary glitch, but it proceeded on to the end ok.  Otherwise the show is great.  I can't give it 5 stars because of this.",1337644800,,602,4.102564102564102

2250672,1,B0007Y08P6,"Ordinarily, I don't mind too many ads before a movie plays because I simply fast forward them most of the time.  However Season 2 of the Andy Griffith show, which I am now re-watching really bugged me, therefore I rarely play that particular disc anymore. At the beginning of the first CD were a number of long ads for sitcoms which were locked in and could not be fast forwarded.  Therefore to see the CD, one was forced to either leave the TV or sit through a whole bunch of grueling coming attractions or ads, until the series started.  Each one was rather long and I didn't like any of the shows that were advertised. In fact they were all pretty bad shows. I'm glad that most present day CD's either have a FF on such ads, or don't use them at all. Thankfully, they didn't do it again on the rest of the series. Perhaps they had some complaints.

I really liked the Andy Griffith show, and still watch it sometimes. But unfortunately, I have to skip the 2nd show because I hate those ads.",1327104000,4,993,4.32258064516129
2250673,5,B0007Y08P6,"Right from the opening few episodes of Season Two, you can tell Andy's character is not quite the same as Season One.  Andy Taylor becomes much less silly and exaggerated, going from the goofy bumpkin of the first season to a much calmer character, but still one that's hilarious and not above an occasional practical joke on Barney.  I've read somewhere else that Andy Griffith figured out after the first season that he should play the straight man to Barney, and I think that hits the nail on the head.  He doesn't lose his charm, his grin, or his country ways, but he's much less the joker than he was in Season One.  Classic episodes from this season include Opie and the Bully, The Pickle Story, Keeper of the Flame, Barney and the Choir, The Merchant of Mayberry (with Ben Weaver), and Andy on Trial.  No new characters are introduced, with Floyd and Otis returning from Season One alongside Barney, Opie, and Aunt Bea.  Mayor Pike and the original Ben Weaver appear in their last season, while Ellie Walker and Emma Watson do not return.  With Ellie gone, Andy's search for a girl is a common theme in this season, as he shows interest in Thelma Lou's skeet-shooting cousin, Karen, visiting manicurist, Ellen Brown, County Nurse Mary, and then a different Mary, the one Barney just won't let him spend a second alone with.  Since Helen Crump comes along in Season Three, this is really the only time in the series where you see Andy single for a long period of time, an interesting difference from other seasons.  Season Two is worth more than five stars, with 31 funny, entertaining, classic episodes of my favorite TV show of all time.",1313107200,2,1645,4.644827586206897

2250680,5,B0007Y08P6,"The second season of The Andy Griffith show is no disappointment.  It is an enjoyable escape into a simpler world of black and white.  It's wholesome, timeless comedy.

Opie and the Bully: Thirsty for milk, Opie hits on his loved ones for ""protection money"".  Andy realizes his son's poor predicament and teaches him the solution comes with a clenched fist!

Barney's Replacement: Andy invites a young, go-getter to be groomed as deputy.  Barney fights back by offering to clean up the town - but at a price.

Andy and the Woman Speeder: An attractive lady is arrested and asks for a public trial.  Buying off her witnesses, she humiliates Andy and found not-guilty.  Adding insult to injury, she exits Mayberry with a lead foot.

Mayberry Goes Bankrupt: Sometimes a man, who makes wax fruit for hats, deserves to lose his home.

Barney on the Rebound: Barney dates Thelma Lou.  Barney proposes to another woman.  Barney breaks his fiancee's heart and dreams.  Thelma Lou forgives Barney.

Opie's Hobo Friend: A poor mountaineer grooms Opie in the fine art of hobos.  Much to the chagrin of Andy.

Crime-Free Mayberry: J. Edger Hoover is so impressed with crime-free Mayberry, he sends a single representative to congratulate the Sheriff.  The news spreads so fast, one photographer bothers to show up.  Somehow, this complicated plot leads to the opening of the long, sealed vault of the Mayberry Bank.  Where's Barney?  He's too busy shopping for medals.

The Perfect Female: Ellie's out, a girl sharpshooter is in as the next candidate for Andy's squeeze.  Boy, is she not interested!

Aunt Bee's Brief Encounter:  Aunt Bee falls for a guy with soft hands, eating onion soup from the back of his truck.  She invites him to live with the Taylors and Andy breaks out the shotgun.

The Clubmen: An exclusive club validates their reasoning for exclusivity.  I am so embarrassed for Barney.

The Pickle Story: Aunt Bee's pickles are so bad, they can fuel rockets.  They're so bad, it doubles as pesticide.  Knowing its history of food poisoning, Andy and Barney distribute jars of them from Nova Scotia to Oregon.  They reverse plans to fix the County Fair contest by eating all the evidence.  My favorite!

Sheriff Barney: Charitable PR gives Barney the opportunity as Sheriff of crime-ridden Greendale.  Andy makes him sheriff for a day and Barney fails at everything he touches.  It takes a bribe of sweet potato pie, to a moonshiner, to keep Barney in Mayberry and spare the city of Greendale a disaster.

The Farmer Takes a Wife: An ogre drags his knuckles into Mayberry choosing Thelma Lou as a wife.  After a failed courtship, rumors have it the brute relocated to Hawaii.

Keeper of the Flame: A secret society is blamed for leveling a barn in flames.  Questionable Constitutionality of search and seizure costs a bitter man a jackpot.  Meanwhile, Opie's college fund is saved.

Bailey's Bad Boy: A man in a hurry is unable to leave Mayberry until he understands the lessons offered by a small town.

The Manicurist: Like magic, a beautiful woman steps off a bus into Mayberry.  She starts a business with questionable planning before it nearly collapses.  Andy cheers her up with a proposal for marriage.

The Jinx: Henry Bennett is well known as far as Raleigh.  A dark cloud looms over his head and bad luck shadows him and all near.  Andy works hard to prove there is no jinx.  He fails.  6 and 7/8th.

Jailbreak: When an SBI agent trusts Andy and Barney to keep a prisoner behind bars at the Mayberry jail, of course he escapes.

A Medal for Opie: When Opie's clairvoyant visions of glory betrays him, he becomes a jerk.

Barney and the Choir: The Mayberry choir is unable to hide from frog-mouth Barney Fife.  They contrive a plan involving a high tech microphone that doesn't really exist.

Guest of Honor: Items mysteriously disappear during Founder's Day celebration.  Even the chosen Guest of Honor is missing.  Andy solves the mystery with a final cigarette.

The Merchant of Mayberry: The Sheriff's office promotes and endorses a new department store threatening Ben Weaver's monopoly.  Evil Ben responds with a fire sale bringing an economic boom to Mayberry.

Aunt Bee the Warden: Otis is pushed out of his second home and sleeps over at the Taylor's.  Aunt Bee sees chores needing done around the house and makes Otis sweat his booze off.

The County Nurse: The state sends a government agent to ensure all citizens are vaccinated against the Swine Flu.  Hearing the horror stories, a lone farmer stands up against the machine and resists.  This stance threatens legal action if not violence!  (I may have embellished, a little)

Andy and Barney in the Big City: Don't stay at this hotel!  It's security detail is easily outsmarted by Barney Fife and the locks on the door aren't worth spit!

Wedding Bells for Aunt Bee: Clara's busy body attitude almost breaks up the family.  There was a reason no woman ever married Fred Goss.

Three's a Crowd: Mary is a hottie!  Her eyes can melt platinum to a boil.  Her voice could sooth song birds into an hypnotic trance.  She was all Andy's until Barney enters her life.  Bye-bye Mary.

The Bookie Barber: Floyd's business expands after decades of stagnation.  This until, Sarah the phone operator listens in and shares confidential conversations with law enforcement.

Andy on Trial: Barney finally admits he has big mouth!  But only after Andy's reputation is publicly tarnished in a newspaper article with Barney's quotes.  Barney keeps his job, under undisclosed circumstances.

Cousin Virgil: Barney desperately wishes to show the good in Cousin Virgil.  But he harbors danger and doom to all he comes near.

Deputy Otis: Drunk boozer Otis asks Andy to help fool his family by making him deputy.  Why not?",1263945600,3,5774,4.8559670781893

I have been a huge fan of the Andy Griffith show for decades and have always wanted what I call the definiitive Barney Fife collection.

2250690,5,B0007Y08P6,"CLASSIC SERIES! There are 31 episodes on five discs in this set which contains many classic episodes though not quite as many as the first season.
The biggest change for the second season is the lack of a romantic interest for Andy Taylor. Gone is Ellie Walker (Elinor Donahue) but not replaced; season two finds Andy dating different ones but none are more than for one episode.

Episode highlights include ""Opie & the Bully"" in which Opie must deal with a bully. Barney wants to interfere but Andy wants Opie to work it out so Andy tells Opie about the time he had to deal with a bully when he was Opie's age.
""Barney' Replacement"" has Barney quitting his position & becomes a vacuum cleaner salesman.
""Andy & the Woman Speeder"" has Andy arresting a female car speeder. While incarcerated she uses her charms to convince Floyd, Barney & Opie to change their testimony.
""Opie's Hobo Friend"" has Buddy Ebsen playing a hobo who influences Opie negatively.
""The Perfect Female"" has Thelma Lou setting up a blind date between her cousin & Andy. They seem to hit it off until the cousin betters Andy in a skeet shooting contest.
""Aunt Bee's Brief Encounter"" has Edgar Buchanan as guest star. He's a traveling handyman who courts Bee but Andy suspects that suspects he's less than ideal.
""The Pickle Story"" in which Aunt Bee makes some more of her horrible pickles.
""The Farmer Takes a Wife"" has Alan Hale, Jr. as guest star who's seeking a wife. He targets Thelma Lou which doesn't make Barney happy.
""Keeper of the Flame"" has Opie joining a secret club & gets the job of keeping the sacred candle. The place where they meet is on private property & the farmer hates them being there. When his barn catches fire he blames Opie.
""Bailey's Bad Boy"" has Bill Bixby as guest star who's arrested by Andy. Bixby threatens to have his rich, influential father to cause trouble for Andy.
""Barney & the Choir"" has Barney joiuning the choir though he can't carry a tune.
""The Merchant of Mayberry"" features Sterling Holloway as guest star as a traveling salesman who Weaver runs out of town because the salesman is selling his wares on the street without a proper building.
""Aunt Bee the Warden"" has Otis having to do his time at Andy's house because he can't be in the sames cell with Four moonshiners who think Otis snitched them out to Andy.
""The Country Nurse"" has the lovely Julie Adams as a nurse. She's there because not everyone in the area has had their tetanus shot. They start with Rafe Hollister who doesn't want the shot.
""Andy on Trial"" has Ruta Lee & Roy Roberts guest starring. Andy goes to the big city to arrest a big publishing mogul who didn't come back to Mayberry for trial. The publisher uses one of his female reporters to dig up dirt on Andy. Barney confesses that Andy is lax to the reporter who's posing as a college student. When Andy is put on trial for malfeasance Barney is the key witness against Andy. In one of Don Knotts' best performances of acting he defends Andy recanting elaborating on the evidence he gave to the reporter.

As a bonus feature this set has the original sponsor spots that the cast did at the end of each episode. The unique thing about the commercials is how they were tied into the episode.",1226188800,3,3234,4.564543889845095

His constant badgering of Barney Pfife was very over done.  I'd have to admit that if I was from the south  especially North Carolina, I would have been quite offended by the ""Andy"" character. The only redeaming quality of the show was the genuine comedic talent of Don Knotts, (the real reason we watched), and the other supporting characters.

and the plot wasn't always obvious. Don Knotts Andy Griffith and especially Ron Howard work brilliantly as the central characters.

Barney and Andy realize the mess they are in and when Barney tries to shoo off a fly and realizes the fly is dead after being on a pickle, well, that's just funny beyond words.

This is a must have set for Andy Griffith fans (and I'm a huge fan).

2250717,5,B0007Y08P6,"I'm so glad these DVD box sets exist, because they gave a twenty-something such as myself the opportunity to become acquainted with one of America's finest television programs...

The story is set in the fictitious little town of Mayberry, North Carolina during the early 1960s. Sheriff Andy Taylor (played by Andy Griffith) is a widower with a small son. He asks his Aunt Bee (Frances Bavier) to move in with him and Opie (Ron Howard) as housekeeper and surrogate mother.

Many of the storylines center upon Opie's childhood dilemmas and coming-of-age situations. While Andy is quick to discipline his son, he is also understanding of the gray areas a child might encounter, and no matter the outcome of a situation, he strives to enforce in Opie the need for kindness and truth.

Other storylines focus upon Barney Fife (played by Don Knotts) as Andy's cousin and the town's deputy sheriff. Thanks to Barney's false pride and need to appear all-knowing, Andy spends much of his time trying to straighten out various situations that might otherwise have never occurred. Still, it's apparent that Barney has a good heart, and his sense of humor more than make up for the trouble he often stirs up.

Mayberry also includes a number of unique residents, such as Floyd, the kindhearted but vague barber; Otis, the town drunk who is trusted to let himself into his cell as needed; and Barney's ever-patient girlfriend, Thelma Lou.

My main gripe with Season 2 is the abrupt disappearance of Andy's girlfriend Ellie Walker, a Northerner who recently moved to town to run her ailing uncle's drugstore. I know that the decision to remove Elinor Donahue had to do with a lack of chemistry with Andy Griffith; however, as far as viewers are concerned, Ellie was a major character in Season 1 and they want and deserve an explanation as to her whereabouts. Throughout Season 1, she and Andy are often together, and Aunt Bee even asks Opie how he'd feel about having her as a stepmother. Then Season 2 begins, and it's as though Ellie never existed. Andy avoids the drugstore altogether, and begins dating other women. How difficult would it have been to simply exposit that Ellie decided to move back home? Took a job in Raleigh? Whatever? Not hard at all, and it would have provided *some* sort of closure for her character.

Nonetheless, if you haven't ever seen an episode of ""The Andy Griffith Show,"" give this box set a try! You'll soon be searching for further seasons.",1164499200,6,2465,4.815602836879433

2250740,5,B0007Y08P6,I have enjoyed both the first and second season.  The DVD was of great picture and sound quality.  My favorite part about videos was being able to watch the entire episode without any cut-outs.,1122508800,,193,4.647058823529412
2250741,5,B0007Y08P6,"Whether you're a casual fan or a devotee who has attempted to collect all 249 episodes of the show, you'll probably enjoy the DVD ""Andy Griffith Show"" collections.

Strengths: DVD convenience; picture/sound quality; all episodes uncut (no editing for time slots or political correctness). You can watch all the episodes from each season of the show in their entirety and in any order you want. If you've ever taken on the challenge of video taping the reruns (let alone succeeded in doing so), it's easy to appreciate the user-friendliness of DVD. For the most part, the picture and sound quality is excellent. It should be remembered that the originals were shot on film that is now roughly 40 years old. I don't know anything about how this collection was transferred to DVD, but it's not of great concern as even the shots that show some age are an enormous improvement over anything you've seen before on TV. The clarity is great -- if you've seen the show so many times you know it by heart, the DVD picture quality will give you the added fun of playing with the ""Zoom"" and ""Pause"" buttons to zoom in on that framed newspaper article, or that license plate, or anything else in-frame that you feel like investigating!

Weaknesses: This is definitely a ""no-frills"" DVD set. The season 1 collection is just that. Just the episodes and abolutely nothing else. Season 2 does contain the original Sanka and Post cereals ads (and presumably Season 3 will as well). That's the only bonus material you'll find, but they are quite entertaining -- since I wasn't around when the show originally aired, I've never seen these before and they are a treat to watch. Some are amusing; some are delightful. The only quibble I have with their inclusion is that, while they are on the disc, they're separated from their corresponding episodes. In the original broadcast format, each ad was somewhat tied in to the storyline of the episode it went with, and you don't quite get the same continuity here. I don't have a fancy DVD player, so I can either watch all the episodes and then watch all the ads, or I can watch the episodes one by one and then go hunting for the ad that went with it. I'd rather they were more seamlessly included -- but as I said, that's a very minor issue.

It's a little disappointing, but not particularly surprising, that the sponsor spots are the ONLY special feature you'll find. No ""behind-the-scenes"" or ""cast interviews"" or anything. On the other hand, although I'd really like to see such material included on future season releases, shallow or poorly made special features are worse than none at all, in my opinion. I'm just happy to have the show on DVD (finally!). Diehard fans will not miss bonus features anyway if they pick up a copy of ""The Andy Griffith Show,"" by Richard Kelly. First published in 1981, it's a little bit dated now but still arguably the best companion to have if you're a serious TAGS fan.",1122249600,,2938,4.678916827852998
2250742,5,B0007Y08P6,If you are an Andy Griffith Show fan this is a must. I really liked the commercials that I have seen. I can not wait for the 3rd season that will be available in August.,1121990400,,169,3.857142857142857
2250743,5,B0007Y08P6,"The episodes on this box set are great, classic episodes.  Each one has its own luster and shine.  My personal favorite being ""Pickle Story"".  The unfortunate addition I mention is courtesy of Universal, who is not satisfied that you are buying a great series they have released on DVD, but also decides to add in excess of 5 minutes of ads for other TV shows.  You cannot skip the ads.  You must set through each and every obnoxious ad.  Thanks, Paramount.  One of the great greed kings.",1121990400,,488,4.540229885057471

I was disappointed, however, in the amount of previews on the first disc.  Each time you play the disc you must watch at least five previews of other shows.  There is the option of advancing through each of them but you still have to watch at least the beginning of each preview.  I would like to suggest the previews be part of the main menu.  Other than the preview issue, I am enjoying watching these classic reruns.",1121904000,2,533,4.29

I can't decide between seasons 1 & 2 which one is my fav.  I do know that season 3 has my 2 favorite episodes.  Convicts at Large and Floyd the Gay Deciever.

And the addition of original commercials is really fun and interesting. Up to this point it is 5 stars, but the addition of 20 minutes of commercials at the beginning of disk one is a bit much. There is no way to cancel or fast forward through the commercials for other DVD's offered through paramount. It seems to only be on disk one, but every time you watch it you have to wait through them. So really I would give it 4 1/2 but since there are no halves it gets a 4.",1118793600,4,577,4.026086956521739
2250751,4,B0007Y08P6,"For many years, we've been bombarded with cheap, poor-quality, often overly high-priced DVDs of ""The Andy Griffth Show"" from independent companies. Now, Paramount is finally giving us what we want...all of the episodes, presented in the best quality possible at this time. After the last release, the fans were upset that the promotional ""tags"" were cut from the shows, and Paramount listened and even put them into this collection. So what's the problem?

These days, most new TV shows, many of which are cheap reality TV, are getting great treatment on DVD, with lots of special features. Really, shows like Survivor and The Apprentice really don't nead a lot of supplementary material, especially when a great classic like this is getting none.

Paramount still isn't putting the least bit of effort into these releases-the art is slapdash and crude, and although there have been almost countless documentaries and interviews on the show, we are getting nothing. There have been several TV Land documentaries, several network reunion shows, and a wonderful made-for-TV reunion feature film (Return to Mayberry, though admittedly they are probably saving this for the last release or as a seperate DVD). There are probably thousands of promotional photos lying around at Paramount they could put into an image gallery. There are TV spots for the show they could put on the DVD, and they didn't bother putting the pilot episode (it was spun off from a different show, which I can not remember right now) on the first set...we get nothing.

I understand Paramount being hesitant to produce new special features for the DVD...actors like Andy Griffith probably aren't going to want to do audio commentary or interviews this late in the game for free. But the fact of the matter is that there is a WEALTH of pre-existing stuff they could easily put on this DVD.

Still, at least the price is pretty good, and you aren't going to find a better release of season two or one than we have on DVD now in this lifetime. Still, we fought for the sponsor spots earlier and Paramount listened. We should keep on fighting--it's not too late to improve the quality of later releases!",1118534400,3,2170,4.920765027322404
2250752,5,B0007Y08P6,"First, let us be careful to accurately define ""commercials"", because there are two different types on this DVD.  The first type is understandably found by many to be undesirable.  At the beginning of disk one is a seemingly endless stream of advertisements for other Paramount DVD sets; these are technically engineered so that you cannot fast forward through them, nor can you skip them by using the menu buttons.  So it appears that an obvious attempt has been made to force viewers to sit through these advertisements whether they want to or not, and of course most do not, especially more than once (after several minutes of playing around with the remote I was able to skip these advertisements by using the 'shuttle' button, that is, the one that lets you skip from chapter to chapter).  So although it is possible to avoid the advertisements, yes they are a pain, and it is indeed pretty tacky of Paramount to attempt to force these on us.

  However, the painkiller that more than makes up for this is in the other type of commercials included on this DVD.  These are the ORIGINAL CAST COMMERCIALS that appeared when the series first aired on network prime time.  In addition to being very rare and hard to find (I have managed to track down only a few on ebay or from private dealers), they are TOTALLY COOL, not to mention very creative and entertaining.  If you are a fan of AG, or just of good TV in general and have never seen these, you don't know what you're missing.

  Each episode of the Andy Griffith show (particularly in the first season) included a one minute commercial for the shows sponsor (Sanka coffee, Post cereals, etc) in which members of the regular cast (Andy, Barney, etc), as well as non recurring guest cast members, worked a plug for the sponsors product into the STORYLINE of that weeks episode. These are very creative and funny, and are very much a part of each episode (ordinarily I loathe, despise, and cannot stand commercials; however, these are of a different stripe altogether). They are truly delightful, like discovering a whole other part of the show that you never knew existed.  They even went to the trouble of remastering them to the same level of quality as the episodes themselves.  Believe me, the kind and generous inclusion of these rare gems on this DVD set more than makes up for the advertisement of other DVD sets on the first disk.  Buy this DVD for yourself, and buy copies for your friends and relatives, and hopefully Paramount will continue to reward loyal AG fans with the cast commercials from future seasons.  THANK YOU PARAMOUNT for demonstrating this consideration for your customers and AG fans the world over.",1118361600,9,2682,4.721030042918455
2250753,5,B0007Y08P6,"I thought season one was great and season two is even better! So beautifully restored, you can clearly see the freckles on Thelmalou's face! Man, what a crush I had on her! Some folks have been complaining about commercials and not enough extras but I think they're doing a great job with these collections by keeping it simple.

  When I went to the local ""Target"" store to get my copy of season two, there was only one copy left, which I grabbed! I also noticed that there were plenty of copies available of other  TV shows so I hope this is a reflection of just how well this collection is selling! I look forward to season 3 and 4!!!!!",1118102400,3,639,4.34453781512605
2250754,5,B0007Y08P6,"If you like good clean fun the Andy Griffith Show is just the ticket. Just purchased the second season and love it. I was a little apprehensive after reading about the commercials on the DVD. There are actually two sets of commercials on this DVD set. The first set on disk 1 is an attempt by Paramount to push its other DVD products. Fortunately you can bypass these even though some reviewers said they couldn't. The second set of commercials is an outtake of old commercials that contain the characters of the Andy Griffith Show. These do not play automatically and are part of the extras offered on the set.

 If you don't know what the Andy Griffith Show is about and you like good clean fun and hate political correctness this series definitely is for you. There are young boys wearing six shooters, pats on the behind, references to law abiding and God fearing citizens, good manors and honesty taught, friendships made, lost and made again, moral lessons and downright wholesome fun. The characters in the show will be long remembered by anyone who watches this show. It's like being with your longtime friends. It's nothing like the junk they make for TV today. This is probably the most loved TV show ever.

 I'm looking forward to the next few seasons on DVD which are suppose to come out at the end of this year.",1118016000,4,1324,4.5974576271186445
2250755,5,B0007Y08P6,"This is an outstanding collection. As for you people complaining about the commercials. WHO CARES!!! We finally have Andy on DVD. At a great price to I might add. I would gladly pay $1,000 and watch hours of commercials in order to own this great show. You people beat everthang you know that!",1117670400,,293,4.547169811320755
2250756,5,B0007Y08P6,"I don't understand the gripe of some reviewers of this DVD set...  Who cares if Paramount put some commercials on ONLY THE FIRST disc???  All you have to do is use the ""skip"" button to fast-forward through them.  I'm just happy to have the set and have it include the original sponsor spots.

this set is well worth the great price",1117497600,,331,4.377049180327869
2250757,5,B0007Y08P6,"""The Pickle Story"", ""Keeper Of The Flame"", ""Barney's Replacement"", ""Crime-Free Mayberry"", ""Barney And The Choir"", ""The Jinx"", ""Aunt Bee, The Warden"", and ""Andy On Trial"" are just a few of the standout episodes featured in this great 5-Disc DVD collection of ""The Andy Griffith Show: The Complete Second Season"".

This second year of ""T.A.G.S."" is really, really good. In addition to the episodes I mentioned above, there's also ""The Manicurist"", which is also one of my favorites. It features future ""I Dream Of Jeannie"" star Barbara Eden guest-starring as manicurist ""Ellen Brown"", who inadvertently stirs up a hornet's nest in Mayberry by just being her sweet (and ultra-fetching) self, causing a tad bit of jealousy among the wives of the barber shop-lounging men of Mayberry, who can't seem to take their eyes off of Ellen's obvious ... er ... curves. :-)

That episode also has Andy's terrific dialogue as he talks to the lovely fingernail-trimmer -- ""Nature has been good to you, Ellen. I mean real, real, REAL good! I can't remember when I've seen nature spend so much time on any ONE person"". (LOL!)

Luckily, the CBS censors weren't being too picky that week. Otherwise, that finely-tuned, roundabout sexual innuendo regarding Miss Brown's (Eden's) curvaceous shape just might not have been allowed to go over the early-'60s airwaves. :-)

Another very pleasing Season-Two 'Andy' entry is the episode called ""Wedding Bells For Aunt Bee"", which is one of the few tear-jerkers in the whole eight years the show was on the air. Aunt Bee becomes convinced she's hampering Andy's efforts to re-marry, so she decides she's going to marry the local dry cleaner (Fred Goss) in order to get out of Andy's hair.

""Wedding Bells"" offers up some fine acting by Frances Bavier (""Aunt Bee""), and yields one of the most truly heartfelt and tender moments of any ""TAGS"" episode (when Andy finally catches on and thwarts Aunt Bee's plan).

Like the excellent first-season set, Paramount Studios has again hit a home run with this second-year Andy Griffith DVD boxed set. The video quality is very good, with each of these 31 black-and-white episodes (which were shot on ""film"" and not ""videotape"") coming through crisp, clean, and clear. Just beautiful. Or, as Andy Taylor might say -- ""These shows look goooo-oooood!""

Video is the standard TV ratio (1.33:1), of course, just as initially shown on network TV back in 1961 and 1962. Audio sounds just fine through the Dolby Digital soundtracks used here (in 2.0 Mono; English only).

Unlike the first-season ""T.A.G.S."" set from Paramount, this Season #2 collection does contain some ""Bonus"" features -- all in the form of ""Original Sponsor Spots"" (i.e.: original commercial advertisements featuring the show's cast members).

And you might be surprised (pleasantly so), as I was, when you find out that nearly every one of these second-season episodes contains a different, original commercial ad (30 of the 31 shows have an ad included)! Very nice bonus indeed -- especially when considering the fact that Season 1 had no supplemental features at all.

Holy Mackerel! I hadn't even realized until watching these Digital Discs that Andy & Company actually filmed a totally-new and different commercial for the sponsor EVERY single week (at least for this second season of the series at any rate)! Can you imagine that?! I'll just be flat dogged!! :-)

None of these commercial ads have been ""integrated"" into the episodes themselves, however. To view them, you must select ""Original Sponsor Spots"" from the Main Menu on each of the five DVDs. There is, however, a ""Play All"" feature available for the Sponsor Spots; so you can watch all of them back-to-back if desired (there are five, six, or seven ads per disc, with each of them running approximately one minute). So, when you add 'em all up, there's approximately a full half-hour of bonus material on these discs! Not bad at all.

Products being pitched by Andy, Opie, Barney, and Aunt Bee include: ""Sanka"" coffee and various ""Post"" brand breakfast cereals (""They're goooooood!""). These advertisements are also ""linked"" to that episode's story line, which adds an extra level of entertainment value into these ""Sponsor Spots"".

These commercial spots also exhibit very good video quality too (pert-near as good as the episodes themselves, if not just exactly as good). There was obviously the same clean-up and/or restoration effort undertaken for these thirty commercial spots as was done for the full-length ""Andy"" episodes. Audio for all these sponsor ads is in Dolby Digital 2-Channel Mono.

Andy Griffith (as ""Andy Taylor"" in these ads) was a very good ""pitch man"" for the products he was endorsing. He makes me want to go and buy some Sanka coffee right now (""It's 97% caffeine-free, and you can drink as much as you want, any TIME you want!""). These are some of the best-written ""cast member"" sponsor plugs you're likely to ever run across. Really fun stuff here!

I applaud Paramount Home Video's TV-On-DVD division for electing to include a lot of these fun-to-see old-time CBS-TV commercials in this DVD set.

There are some other ""ads"" (of sorts) included on Disc 1 of this set -- those being: six different ""Trailers"" for other Paramount TV-On-DVD products (total run time of about 6 minutes; 6:10 to be exact). Only the first disc contains these DVD ads. I'm not thrilled about the fact that the ""Menu"" buttons on the DVD Player's remote control have been 'locked-out' during the playing of these trailers (which start up automatically when you load up Disc #1).

However, these trailers/ads CAN be very easily bypassed -- you're NOT ""forced"" to watch these six ads. To skip past them, press ""Skip""/""Chapter Advance"" (which is a remote button that has not, thankfully, been ""locked"" out) multiple times consecutively (six times precisely) to get to the Main Menu screen. A bit of a pain in the rump, true. But six quick keystrokes are better than being forced to watch the 6 minutes of DVD ads.

Other items, however, that appear when you first load up any of these discs -- e.g.: the Paramount logo screen and the proverbial FBI/piracy ""warning"" -- are NOT capable of being skipped quickly no matter what remote buttons you choose. So everyone is forced to wait until those things go by at their own speed. But those two things go by pretty fast; but it'd be nice if those, too, were skippable. But they aren't on this set.

I'm not wild about these DVD Trailers being included on Disc 1 (and the ""Menu"" button most certainly shouldn't have been disabled, IMO) -- but overall this is a very minor complaint, because this Andy Griffith set is fantastic in every (other) way.

BTW -- In case you're interested, the six TV DVDs being plugged on Disc 1 are: ""The Brady Bunch"", ""Happy Days"", ""Laverne & Shirley"", ""Mork & Mindy"", ""MacGyver"", and ""Charmed"".

To avoid the wrath of customers who hate these DVD ads more than Andy dislikes Aunt Bee's wretched pickles, my suggestion to Paramount for future ""T.A.G.S."" releases would be to place these DVD trailers in a separate section that can be accessed from the Main Menu (which is exactly how Columbia/Sony has presented ads of this nature on its DVDs). That way, the consumer can have the ""choice"" of viewing them (or not), rather than having the ads part of the automatic ""load-up"" each time you pop the disc into the DVD Player.

Here are some more of the particulars concerning this DVD boxed set..............

>> Number of Discs -- 5; All Single-Sided discs.

>> Episodes per disc -- Seven episodes on disc 1; Six episodes on discs 2-5. .... Episodes are laid out in ""Airdate"" order.

>> ""Play All Episodes"" option? -- Yes.

>> Chapter Stops included for each episode? -- Yes; 5 chapters per program.

>> Are the shows uncut/unedited? -- Yes; Running time per episode is between 25 and 26 minutes. All originally-aired ""Epilogues"" are intact on the DVDs. And the original ""Fishin' Hole"" whistling theme song is intact as well -- for both the opening and closing credits.

>> Menus -- Non-animated; No music; Main Menu doubles as the 'Episode Choice' Menu; A different background picture for all five discs (although why in the world a picture of ""Deputy Warren Ferguson"", who didn't join the cast until years later, has been used for the Disc-Three Menu is a bit of a mystery); Very user-friendly menu design, with quick response time when selecting from the menus; A ""Sheriff's Badge"" icon is used to navigate the various menu options.

>> Packaging -- The five DVDs are packaged inside three slim-style ""ThinPak"" plastic cases (two ""double-disc"" slim cases, plus one single-disc slim case). The three plastic cases then slide into a sturdy cardboard outer ""slipcase"" box.

This boxed set's physical ""footprint"" is really a space-saver. Those DVD collectors who don't like bulky TV-On-DVD collections should admire the dimensions of this set. It's just seven-eighths of an inch thick (approx.)!

I'm not real wild about the ""Andy/Aunt Bee"" (colorized) cover art used by Paramount for this DVD package. I think a better-looking front-cover image (or a series of composite pics) could have been used here. But, you can't have everything I guess. (I also have my doubts as to whether this cover photo of Andy is from the second season. I think it might be from a later season. But this cover-art matter is trivial and of very little overall significance.)

But, all things considered, I admire the look and design of this set's packaging a great deal. Each of the three slim cases features unique artwork, with Case #1 (which has Discs 1 and 2) showing us a picture of Andy and Barney drinking coffee; while Case #2 (which houses Discs 3 and 4) offers up a photo of Andy and Opie in front of a ""Kids Back In School"" sign (Opie, with schoolbooks in hand, doesn't look too pleased, which seems fitting here); and the third case (with Disc 5) depicts a guitar-playing Andy alongside one of his pre-Helen Crump love interests, ""Mary Simpson"" (played by Sue Ane Langdon).

There's an ""Apple Pie"" theme utilized throughout the packaging here, with the back side of each of the three plastic cases displaying the titles for each of the episodes contained within that case on a ""recipe card"" with the heading of ""Aunt Bee's Apple Pie Recipe"".

While the discs themselves feature a clever use of ""disappearing"" apple pie .... Disc 1 shows a picture of a nearly-whole pie (with just a single piece cut out of it); with discs 2 through 4 revealing less and less pie with each higher-numbered disc. By the time we get to Disc #5, the entire pie has been eaten, and all we see on this last disc is a picture of Aunt Bee's empty pie plate. A very charming and apropos disc design indeed.

More detailed episode information (including show descriptions and original CBS-TV airdates) can be located on the inside of each of the three cases. When a disc is removed from its holder, that disc's episode info is revealed underneath.

Overall, it's a first-rate, classy-looking, and nicely-done presentation for Andy's second season on DVD.

-------------------

Final Thoughts..........

The debut season of ""The Andy Griffith Show"" was a true winner (IMO), and this follow-up second year of the series is every bit as entertaining and funny as the first (possibly even a bit better). And it's hard not to marvel at the outstanding work done by the Paramount team here, as they have provided fans of this TV series with the best possible quality for these 31 shows by releasing a DVD boxed collection that sparkles in every respect.

These episodes look so good on Digital Versatile Disc that even Aunt Bee's ""kerosene cucumbers"" seem good enough to eat. .... Well, er, uh, wait a minute. .... I take that back. I'm not sure even HD-DVD could perform that Herculean task. LOL!",1117411200,43,11818,4.8895
2250758,5,B0007Y08P6,"Hey, I didn't see the paramount advertisements when I first got my set because I went right to some of my all time favorite episodes, Barney and the Choir, Andy on trial, the pickle story, Cousin Virgil (Michael J. Pollard who I met in New York nearly 30 years ago). I always like a good crab joke.

  I never seem to be amazed at how quickly human beings become spoiled. When season one came out, some of you were whineing about not having any extras or showing the old sponser spots. Now with season 2, Paramount gives us the sponser spots which I haven't seen since I was 9 and they are great. Now some of you want to return your set and are cussing out Paramount for putting the ads for other box sets at the beginning of disc 1. ( by the way, I quickly can skip thru the commercial by hitting my skip button on my dvd remote 4 or 5 times) For more than 20 years we loved the Griffith show in re runs on TBS and TV Land even though the episodes were all chopped up with commercials and one fifth of the show deleted. Then came the crummy dvds they sold at Wal Mart for 5 bucks with the scenes still missing and the wrong theme music.

  Viacom - Paramount has given us the complete second season with extras from their arcives. The best quality you will ever see, the complete episodes, priced fairly. What more can you ask for? For my money, 5 stars is not enough to rate this set! I appreciate it and good night.",1117238400,6,1418,4.156934306569343

Secondly, if they MUST put previews, WHY can't we at least fast-forward them?  I think it was pretty low for the company to make the previews unable to be forwarded through-- low!",1117152000,,490,4.7976190476190474

Of course, Paramount could have been nice and left the commercials off, but their main concern is making money, and lots of it.  The inconvience of spinning through the commercials (which takes me approximately 10 seconds) is nothing when compared to the rest of the DVD's content!  This is easily the best situation comedy of all time and has never stopped being aired in the nearly 45 years since it first ran on CBS.  This DVD will be highlighted in my DVD collection, just as season one is.  I especially like the added ""original sponsor spots"",  many of which I don't remember ever seeing before.  Does anyone know if these ""spots"" ran during the first season of the show?  If so, I hope they tag them on to the season three set along with the season three spots.",1117065600,3,889,4.50625

Maybe they could sprinkle the ads from the first season in with the others on the next few sets?,1116979200,4,268,4.5625
2250764,5,B0007Y08P6,Not only the full shows but Andy and the gang would do commercials for Sanka and other products. The commercials were shown at the end of the show and made reference to the epidode in some way . And here they are. Nice to see.,1116979200,4,226,4.044444444444444
2250765,5,B0007Y08P6,"This morning I bought this box set; the day it was released. My DVD player has been running all day. The second season of The Andy Griffith Show is one of the series' best.

This set is filled with episodes which have been restored flawlessly. Details in the sets, the shadows on the walls, wrinkles in clothing and everything are much more vivid than you could ever see on syndicated reruns.

A special added attraction are the delightful original sponsor spots. It's an episode in itsself  to see Rafe Hollister knowing everything about Sanka!

What you're getting for the price, this is a bargain! Can't wait for all the black & white seasons to be released on DVD.

I'll eat Aunt Bee's pickles!",1116892800,3,698,4.642276422764228
2250766,5,B0007Y08P6,"The only negative is on the first dvd.  You have to sit through six commercials of other dvd sets and you can't fast forward or go to menu either.  Oh well, as Calvin Coolidge said ""everybody complains about the commercials, but nobody does anything about 'em.""

The quality is great and the extras of original Sanka and Post Toasties commercials with Andy and the gang are fun to watch.  It's almost like having another epilogue.

Go ahead !!! Do it!!! Do it!!!!  Go buy the set, then watch Thelma Lou on TV,  just DO IT!!!!!",1116892800,,526,4.473684210526316
2250767,5,B0007Y08P6,"The Andy Griffith show to me was the last great sitcom. While watching the show, you feel as if you are resident of Mayberry. Of course the B&W episodes were the best because these are the ones that featured Barney. I hope that they will release all of the seasons on DVD in a quick manner. The release of season 2 today is especially bittersweet because we were all saddened to learn of the passing of Howard Morris, aka Ernest T. Bass. Although he only appeared in a handful of episode, we felt that he was always a part of that show. He will definitely be missed.",1116892800,3,566,4.299065420560748
2250768,5,B0007Y08P6,"At long last, The Andy Griffith Show is finally getting its due. I received Season One for Christmas, and it was (and still is) beautiful. The picture is as sharp as 'ol Andy's mind. It was a dream come true, in a manner of speaking, to finally see the greatest show of all time get the treatment it has deserved since DVDs were invented. And now we're being treated with another slice of sweet, heavenly Mayberry pie. Now, after this, we should have six more luscious servings to go. And the funny thing is, I'll never get stuffed.

But the only bad thing about these sets so far is the lack of extra archival bonus features. To me, stuff like that is fascinating to watch. And also some new documentaries would be wonderful as well. Not to mention commentaries by some of the original cast members like Andy Griffith, Ron Howard, Don Knotts & others, and the series' writers, as well as writers/historians like Neal Brower, Ken Beck, Jim Clark, Joey Fann and Richard Kelly. That would be incredible. And what I think would be interesting would be a documentary on all of the writers of the show (Aaron Ruben, Jim Fritzell, Everett Greenbaum, Harvey Bullock, etc.)

But, all in all, this is the most minor (albeit a bit lengthy) of complaints which will not stop me from going out and getting this the day it is released. Keep 'em comin', guys!

And lots of luck to you and yours.",1116806400,2,1381,4.516
2250769,5,B0007Y08P6,"...I personally rate the second season of TAGS a half-star higher than the 1st season, only because the characters start to come into their own a bit more.  Andy gradually loses his WILL STOCKDALE accent from NO TIME FOR SERGEANTS, and Don Knotts truly starts developing the legendary character of Bernard P. Fife in episodes such as 'The Pickle Story', 'Barney's Replacement' and 'Sheriff Barney'.  Other favorites from season two are 'The Manicurist' with Barbara Eden, 'Barney and the Choir', and 'Aunt Bee the Warden'.  Season three will truly be a treat, as the show really begins to hit its stride.  Regardless, I'll own 'em all before all is said and done (yes, even the color episodes).

Just remember:

Now I'm 22 and I still watch it almost every night at 10. I grew up in a small town in the south so I knew people like these characters, old country folks you can't help but love.",1116374400,6,351,4.0285714285714285
2250771,4,B0007Y08P6,"The Andy Griffith show is really quite unique once you think about it.  It was on the air for eight season on CBS never finishing lower than #7 in the ratings.  True, there was less competition in the early 60's but that's still a remarkable feat.  Don Knotts in one of the greatest and most underrated TV roles in history won five emmy awards for his supporting role of Barney Fife.  The show would spawn two successful spin-offs ""Gomer Pyle"" and ""Mayberry RFD"". This is truly an example of one of the great shows in American TV history.  I was too young to remember these as first run but thanks to repeats, I've come to have a great appreciation for this wonderfully funny show that emphasized family values so well.  One of the great things about TV shows of the 1960's is that they did so many more episodes than the standard 22 of shows today.  This second season of ""Andy"" features a huge 31 episodes in all.  I mean that's almost a season and a half compared to today's shows.

My favorite episodes were always the one's that featured Don Knotts prominently.  Barney Fife, as mentioned, is one of TV's all-time great characters played magnificently by the manic, nervous Don Knotts who I just loved as a kid in movies like ""The Ghost and Mr. Chicken"" and ""Shakiest Gun in the West"".  With that in mind my favorite episodes from season two are:

""Barney's Replacement""  Barney thinks that Andy wants to replace him as his deputy.

""The Club Men""  Barney and Andy want to join a fishing club but when Barney makes a pest out of himself the club only wants Andy and not barney.

""Sheriff Barney""  An all-time favorite as Barney is offered the position as Sheriff of another town.  Andy decides to show Barney just what he's in store for when he lets him be acting sheriff of Mayberry just for a day.

""Barney and the Choir""  Barney is a member of the Mayberry Choir..unfortunately he can't sing a lick.  Finally they give him a mic that is turned off with someone else singing in the background.

""Cousin Virgil""  Barney's cousin Virgil comes to town played by Michael J. Pollard who just can't do anything right, much to Barney's annoyance.  Look for Ron Howard's father Rance in a bit role as a Bus Driver.

One of the great things about shows from the 60's is the many great guest stars who were perhaps not known much at the time but would go on to become big stars.  In season two guest stars include:  Barbara Eden, Jackie Coogan, Buddy Ebsen, Alan Hale Jr., Bill Bixby, and Sterling Holloway.

Great show from a great period in American TV.",1115683200,10,2552,4.501089324618737

I have seen every episode through to the less funny end but I still get a kick out of it. How this show has stayed relevent and hilarious throughout three generations, even for california brats/punks (such as myself), is something truely spectacular. Even now this show is a staple in my family and, thanks to these DVD sets, it always will be.
