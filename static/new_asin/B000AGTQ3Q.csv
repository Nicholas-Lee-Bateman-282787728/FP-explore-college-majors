8078415,3,B000AGTQ3Q,"I really enjoy seeing movies from the 40's and 50's and was looking forward to viewing the four featured on this DVD.

It was an ok experience watching these once, but I wouldn't bother watching them again.

Rain with Joan Crawford is quite a ""racy"" movie, given the era (30's) that it was produced in. I didn't even recognize Joan Crawford at first, she looks very different from how she did in later years. I remember watching her movies from the 40's and 50's when I was a kid, with my mom.

The other movies on this DVD are a bit newer vintage. All of them have their ""moments"" but nothing really memorable here. Some of the vintage movies from this era (like Casablanca for example) I can watch again and again. Not the case with these four.",1400889600,,746,4.391304347826087

8078419,5,B000AGTQ3Q,"This DVD includes one of my very favorite movies (""Rain"") staring my very favorite actress (Joan Crawford). And I am was very pleasantly surprised because the ""Silver Screen Series"" DVD includes 3 other movies that are all very good and compelling, as well. This DVD was put out in 2005 by a company called Platinum Disc LLC.

These are the 4 movies included:
Rain - staring Joan Crawford
1932 / 76 mins. / black and white

Home Town Story - staring Marilyn Monroe
1950 / 61 mins. / black and white

Three Guys Named Mike - staring Jane Wyman
1951 / 89 mins. / black and white

Whistle Shop - staring Ava Gardner
1945 / 84 mins. / black and white

The cover of the DVD is very nice, although I don't think Joan would have appreciated taking second fiddle to Marilyn Monroe. But that's why I love Joan, because even though she never received the acclaim that a two-bit actress received, she still gave 110% to her public. BTW, be sure to take a look at the scan that I took the time to post of the back cover of the DVD and of the disc (which includes a color silk-screen picture on it).

According the the brief credits that roll before the main menu comes up, these movies have all been digitally remastered. I could not tell though. I own several copies of ""Rain"" on DVD as it's been released at least half a dozen times over the years (since it's in public domain and since it's one of Joan's most famous roles I suppose just about everyone wants to get a piece of the action) and could not tell much of a difference. Nevertheless, I thought the overall picture and sound quality of all the movies was at least good. One thing I did not like was that the company's name (Platinum Disc) appeared in the corner of the screen.

If you're looking for a DVD with a lot of quality movies at a great price then this is a sure pick.",1259971200,31,1827,4.278260869565218
