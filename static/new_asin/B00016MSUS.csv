1974394,1,B00016MSUS,"Poor story, worse acting, appalling film making.  This film sems to have been made to ""showcase"" the dubious talent of its maker and lead ""actor"".  I've seen hammers with more expression and talent.  Don't bother unless you're masochistic enough to sit through it.  Less enjoyable than chewing tyres.",1199664000,12,300,5.1875
1974395,5,B00016MSUS,"How gratifying was to see a film that is not just highly entertaining but also socially relevant with a powerful message about the need of letting go of our judgements if in fact we all want to live harmoniously in a world as diverse as ours.

This is independent cinema at its best!",1118361600,5,283,4.339622641509434
8007221,5,B00016MSUS,"An amazing story of conversion and redemption. I met Fr. Calloway and he has a beautiful, gentle spirit, now. God is good!",1496620800,,122,4.590909090909091
8007222,5,B00016MSUS,Good quality CD.,1477699200,,16,4.666666666666667
8007223,4,B00016MSUS,"It's sad that even living in the 21st century, we still prejudices. This is a story about a father that lost his wife and came to AmerKa to give his daughter a better life. I am not condoning his actions from the time he hit the girl on but I do understand why he behaved in the manner that he did. At the end, he saw no way out of his situation but by his action, it caused a reaction that sustained his daughter's future.",1431216000,,423,3.988235294117647
8007224,1,B00016MSUS,Not very interesting. Turned it off after about 15 minutes.,1429056000,,59,5.0
8007225,1,B00016MSUS,"And the story seemed like it was being written as it was being filmed. When a six-year-old girl is the most believable actor in a film, it's time to move on to a different movie.",1415404800,,178,4.114285714285714
8007226,4,B00016MSUS,"It was a good movie. What I like about it was how this family who lost their daughter was forgiving and took in the little girl who lost her father which is a postive massage to those who may have gone or is going through the same thing. This movie also shows a father's love for his daughter due to the sacifices that he was willing to make even risking his own life. There is a spirtual part to this movie ,which is very moving. It is a must see movie",1391904000,3,453,3.989010989010989
8007227,5,B00016MSUS,A compelling story line that touches on important issues... characters you care about that are portrayed by great actors... that's what makes a great movie and this is a great movie.,1377993600,2,182,4.903225806451613
8007228,1,B00016MSUS,"I cannot fathom people making money off of making movies about illegal aliens doing anything other than getting deported or first serving time for the incredible numbers of crimes these creatures commit when they enter our country for a ""better life"". Illegal aliens are a scourge in every respect. What part of ""illegal"" do people not understand?
While we watch our politicians pandering to these overbreeding burdens on our society, we are still waiting for the promised fencing to be built and for increased drone survellaince of our borders, a law that was promised to have already been completed and yet little work has been done.
What on earth is it going to take? The murder of a U.S. Senator or a U.S. Representative to get Congress to finally begin truly working on the promised protection that has already been passed? Innocent ""regular citizens"" are victimized every day by these lawbreakers. To consider them as anything but the felons that they are is incredibly stupid but then so is the reelection of the same liars that made these empty promises and signed them into law to begin with only to sit calmy by while inaction rules.
Though I find it difficult to wish harm on anyone I almost wish that the politicians that promised to secure our borders actually become first hand witnesses to the crimes a large proportion of these illegal aliens perpetrate every day. That would seem to be the only way to actually get these people off their backsides and secure our borders.
Pandering to the hordes of illegal ""immigrants"" by supplying them with BILLIONS of dollars worth of entitelements is not the way to maintain the sovereignty of our nation. SHOVEL READY JOBS is the way to get our border secure. The law, in part has already been passed, when is action going to take place?
These ""people"" shouldn't be the subject matter for movies. There is nothing entertaining about anything about these people. They are a scourge and if you have to make a movie about these people please show the truth of what they are doing everday to damage our country. Get out of your movie chair and contact your Representatives and demand that this flow of felons be stopped immediately!",1373414400,,2184,4.795755968169761
8007229,2,B00016MSUS,"Fell asleep twice, kept hitting the forward button hoping things would pick up; it never did. I would not recommend.",1367107200,3,116,4.85
8007230,5,B00016MSUS,"Gives a whole different aspect to crimes committed by illegal aliens-one that I never considered.  Superb acting by the main characters, the actress playing the six year old girl is incredible.  A new story line completely original and an excellent screen play.",1362441600,4,261,5.190476190476191
