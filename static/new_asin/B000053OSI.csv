1390429,4,B000053OSI,"Revelation of the Daleks was a huge positive surprise to me, as big as the disappointment of the awful Resurrection of the Daleks (It's easy to confuse the names, so beware). Written by the same guy, Eric Saward, this Dalek story is every bit as violent and grim as its precedessor, however with a few crucial differences.
  Revelation has a plot, with some nice black humor (two great jokes involving lost limbs) and memorable characters with good lines, played by charismatic actors. Especially notable are Kara (Eleanor Bron) and the killer Orcini (William Gaunt), a character funny and dignified at the same time.
  While Revelation of the Daleks is not perfect, it has enough memorable moments (like the doctor facing his own death) to make it probably the only Colin Baker-era Doctor Who story i would like to see again. Baker can be exciting and charismatic, if only they had given him more stories like this...",1024876800,,918,4.865384615384615
1390430,4,B000053OSI,"I was always busy when Revelation of the Daleks came on TV, so it was a real treat to finally see this one in it's entirety. Revelation was a bit over the top in places, the DJ especially. And killing Daleks with Rock and Roll???. The main problem I have with this story is that I wish that the identity of the Great Healer, later revealed to be Davros, should have been kept secret for longer. Brit-com fans will enjoy the perforance of Clive Swift, better know to us as Richard Bucket (or is that Bouquet?) from kepping up Appearances. Some of the special effects, particualarly the Glass Human-Dalek, really gives the show a boost.",1001376000,3,634,4.521739130434782
1390431,2,B000053OSI,"I remember sitting in front of my TV every night and watching Doctor Who religiously, which transformed me into a Tom Baker addict and completely biased me against any of the future Doctors.  It has taken over fifteen years and repeated viewings to realize that Colin Baker was excellent as the Doctor and was simply a victim of the writers.  I found the acting in this show excellent from all characters(with the exception of Alexi Sayle, who only gets my forgiveness because he was a Young One).  However, I watch these shows for the Doctor, and by placing him in a secondary role for the majority of the first act was infuriating.  The scene order just felt terribly out of place and it slowed down the pacing. I do not know if Eric Saward wrote the plot this way, but I think with a little editing and repositioning of scenes this could have been a really memorable episode.  I recommend this episode only if you are a hardcore Colin Baker fan.",994377600,5,948,4.52046783625731
1390432,5,B000053OSI,"I won't mince words. I believe that Eric Saward was the best Dr. Who writer. This is one of his weaker stories and it still manages to rate five enthusiastic stars from me. This is mostly due to Director Graeme Harper, who also directed The Peter Davison farewell story ""The Caves of Androzani"", another classic. The main characters aren't Peri or The Doctor, they are Davros, A.K.A. The Great Healer - with his new plans for universal conquest, Orcini and his squire Bostock- an Honorable Knight in exile, turned assassin, who seeks to regain his lost honor by killing Davros, Then there's the DJ, a nice and funny man who just knows too much of what's going on at Tranquil Repose. Then there are others on Necros with their own plans, schemes and problems, I don't want to give anything away, but each element of the story is interesting and takes center stage while it is told. There is a lot of death happening at this ""Funeral Home"", which seems appropriate, but much of the violence was edited out before the story was ever broadcast. Episode one should end with a statue of the Doctor Falling over as Blood drips out of the statue's eye. The blood was cut but the reference to the blood is left in at the beginning of the next episode. In the second episode, a hypodemic needle is stabbed into a character's chest. The sequence edited out was of the hypodermic emptying itself into the victim. The last edit was of the Doctor's last word, Where he's going to take Peri on the next adventure. We experience a freeze frame, but the word was Blackpool, which would lead into the next season's first planned story ""The Nightmare Fair"". We all know that Season 23 was cancelled and later changed into ""The Trial of a Timelord"". I should point out that these are not the edits that were made to this video release. Those edits are of the music that the DJ plays. The BBC didn't want to pay for the rights to reuse the music and so garbled it in some sequences and pruned others. I have compared my off-air recording to this video release and, fortunately, there is nothing lost because of this editing. Still, it's a shame that the story will not be seen in it's ""As Broadcast"" or ""As Filmed"" versions. Perhaps a future  DVD release will correct this missed opportunity.",983923200,4,2271,4.552567237163815
1390433,5,B000053OSI,"""Soylent Green"" and ""The Loved One"" meet Doctor Who! ""Revelation of the Daleks"" shows the strengths of both a 45-minute episode format and the Colin Baker era. Although, it isn't Eric Saward's best script, in fact, Saward does a nice job of aping a Robert Holmes script, with double-play acts from hell! Good thing the acting is top notch! It boast a wonderful guest cast that includes Eleanor Braun, Clive Swift, Alexi Sayle and William Guant to name a few. Though some might complain that there isn't enough of the Doctor or the Daleks in this story. But like ""Genesis of the Daleks"", ""revelation"" is a Davros story, trying to regain his power and control of the Daleks by recreated new ones from bodies left at Tranquil Repose. The DJ scenes are very odd for the program, but refreshing. Terry Molloy steals the show playing just the head of Davros in glass casing for more than half the story! Clive Swift as the Chief Embalmer is just wonderful. His lusting over Peri is quite exceptable unlike Mestor in ""The Twin Dilemma"". Looks great, sounds great, a must see and get!",983232000,,1076,4.668421052631579
1390434,5,B000053OSI,"The Doctor and Peri arrive on Necros, the 'planet of the dead', where there is a whole complex filled with people in suspended animation whilst the Great Healer works on cures for whatever diseases they are suffering from.
But before long the 'Great Healer' is revealed to be none other than Davros, sinister genetic engineer and creator of the Daleks.  Having been abandoned by the original Daleks, he is engineering replacements.
This is not only the best Colin Baker story, but also one of the finest Dalek adventures ever made.  There is a very grown-up feel about it with genuine suspence, sexual undercurrents and horror which is suggestive rather than tasteless.  The whole thing is filled with strong characters such as bounty hunters (a space-age knight and his squire), a superbly cold-hearted female villain and a futuristically-weird DJ.  Davros and the Daleks (with impressive new white casings) are at their dramatic best and the music and scenery are first-rate.  Watch for one partically memorable scene involving a glass Dalek.
Highly recommended.  Even if you dislike Colin Baker (though personally I think he was an under-rated Doctor who should have been given more time in the series), this adventure is still unmissable.",976147200,42,1242,5.154228855721393
1390476,5,B000053OSI,"Poor Davros, how can you take it? It was bad enough when everyone on Necros realizes all the people have been stolen from their tombs. It got worse when the Doctor arrived right at the most precarious moment of your scheme. Also, we can't forget about the time when Kara betrayed you and hired Orcini to assassinate you. But it was the last straw when Orcini released all your prisoners, and then came in and tried to kill your (spoilers) puppet self (spoilers). Could it get any worse? Of course it can, when the Doctor barges in at the last moment, (spoilers) Bostock shoots off your hand, and then the Necros workers bring in the Renegade Daleks to ship you away back to Skaro! (spoilers)

I liked Revelation of the Daleks a lot, it had a lot of great scenes, and the option to watch it with CGI effects is very nice. The first part moves a little slowly, but the second part, WOW! What a finale! I would recommend this video highly to anyone, but would warn that this is one of the scarier and morbid Doctor Who episodes. There are some gross scenes, and some very creepy incidental music.

It was very nice that in this episode, there was really not too much of the Doctor. Not that Colin Baker isn't a good actor, but it is just nice to get more of the villains and supporting actors then all the Doctor and Peri.

The costumes were really good too in this story. Although the Daleks were as rickety as any other story, the Glass Dalek was really good, and it was a really grotesque costume for Natasha's dad that had been turned into a Dalek. Lastly, I also loved the gross face of the mutant person from Davros' experiments in part one.

All in all there were flaws, and this isn't my favorite Doctor Who episode, but I still highly recommend it because of all the flaws I could see, they were all very minor and didn't really detract from the story in the end.",1416268800,,1869,4.362068965517241

1390478,5,B000053OSI,"After I watched the first episode of this story, I wasn't particularly enthralled. Sure, there were some brilliant standalone moments, but it just moved so slowly. Then, when I watched episode 2, I completely understood. Unlike many stories, this one took the time to develop three dimensional and morally grey characters, which makes it all the more devastating when many of them are killed off. I still stand by my opinion that it starts rather slowly, but the concluding episode is dark, thrilling, and downright brilliant. The production values are high, Colin Baker, Nicola Bryant, and Terry Molloy give splendid performances, and the vast supporting cast is one of the best in series history. If the Daleks weren't in this story, it would still be a spectacular character-driven serial, but the Daleks are just a bonus. 'Revelation of the Daleks' is a true classic, and one of my absolute favorites from the underrated Colin Baker era. If you're undecided about whether or not to purchase the DVD, I say go for it. You are guaranteed a great story, and the special features, while limited, are very good.",1398124800,,1110,4.9411764705882355

1390482,5,B000053OSI,"This is fun to watch. The fat disc jockey is ridiculous. The music is nice and corny. It's the mid 80's. The only Dalek story of Colin Baker (6th Doctor) He lucky enough to have beautiful Nicola Bryant as Perpugillim (Peri) Brown by his side. (Story 140) Mark of the Rani and (Story 143) Revelation of the Daleks are the only 2 interesting stories of the 6th Doctor. (Story 137) The Twin Dilemma is funny because of the 2 twin boys. Math geniusus playing space chess and high tech computers. Remus and Romulus.

(Story 138) Attack of The Cyberman is terrible. So is (Story 139) Vengeance of Varos. Sil looks disgusting.

Watch Revelation of the Daleks. Davros survived again. After what happened to him in Resurrection of the Daleks. I kind of learned that the bald headed professor is too picky and has the hots for Peri. The old professor with mustache wearing a wig. I heard that place is the future death and resting place of the Doctor. It was messed up that the old woman loved this professor and worked for Davros. Since this old man with the wig called the old woman ugly and rather travel with his mother. The old woman stabbed him in the chest with some poisonous needle and fell in floor. And the old woman got zapped by a single dalek.

The fat dj has a device to zap daleks. Unfortunately he lost his life and Peri was captured. The 6th Doctor finally have a talk with Davros. And some guy on that planet called another form of DALEKS in black design. I believe their the Supreme Daleks. I can't remember, due to my poor attention span. In the end, The 6th Doctor, Peri, rest of soldiers were saved. And Davros and his Daleks in white surrendered. And they all evacuated the building before it's about to explode.

A violent Dalek story. I havent' watch the 1st and 2nd Doctor Who Dalek story. 3rd Doctor had Day of The Daleks, Planet of the Daleks, Death to the Daleks. 4th Doctor has Genesis of the Daleks, so on. And 5th Doctor only has Resurrection of The Daleks. Weapons were cheesy. Turlough was smart to lead the Dalek fighters.

1390484,2,B000053OSI,"John Nathan-Turner was the worst thing to happen to Doctor Who until they began the new series! Revelation of the Daleks is hard to watch.

The introduction of Colin Baker was kind of the beginning of the end of the series, although his character later changed into a more humerous one that could be tolerated. This show is not too good. In fact, it's rather bad. Even the acting on this show is below par. I got the feeling I was watching Community Theater! The characters are talked up in the dialog but the actors portraying them don't live up to all the talk. There was no energy or drive in the acting or in the show in general.

The music, actually, is the star. We hear it blaring away even over the dialog as people are talking in hushed voices. The character's reactions to things are NOT believable! One's father is being turned into a dalek but the reaction of the daughter doesn't live up to this!

The show is also plodding and there is too much going on with too many characters and yet it feels like very little is accomplished or revealed. I didn't enjoy the DJ either, I neither found him humorous or interesting.

For such a low level story the extra features seem rather much. The weirdness of this storyline and some of the ones that came after this seem to be what the ""new"" series has embraced.",1363824000,,1316,4.403292181069959
1390485,5,B000053OSI,"This is one of my favorite Sixth Doctor stories. It has an interesting funeral-planet subplot which has a number of interesting characters aside from the Daleks and their plans.

The settings are interesting, and there are even deeper questions about life and death involved.

1390503,4,B000053OSI,"The Colin Baker era Doctor Who epsidoe entitled ""Revelation of the Daleks"" sees the Doctor and Peri traveling to the planet Necros or where it is more commonly known in the universe as Tranquil Repose so the Doctor may pay his respects to a freind named Arthur Stengos.  What worries the Doctor is that Arthur Stengos would never dream of placing himself in such a state on of all places Tranquil Repose.  For those who do come are not truly dead but at the last few moments of life where science or medicene can not help them and wait for a cure to save them.
  The planet is lead by a man called ""The Great Healer"" for it was him that was able to make Tranquil Repose what it is today.  While the Great Healer is a secerative person his liason and head of the Tranquil Repose facility Jobel prepares for a very special service for the galactic president who is placing his wife there.  While that is going on two people make there way deep into the vaults where the bodies are placed to find a body.  These two make a startling discovery that the body they have been searching is not there. Not knowing what is going  on the delve deeper into the vaults to find a laboratory and with all things embrioes growing into Daleks! They discover that the body they have been searching has mutated and still alive and turning into a Dalek to serve its master Davros.
  Davros or what's left of him has taken over Tranquil repose and has begun again with a new breed of Daleks a breed loyal only to him. Davros has also had a few set backs since he needed money  and has to deal with agents on another planet who want all the money for themselves and plan on having Davros killed by an assasin called Osini exlied knight of the Grand Order of Oberon and his squire Bostock.
  Meanwhile the Doctor and Peri find themselves in Tranquil Repose garden and discover a statue of himself. The Doctor doesn't understand and even stranger still he fears he has stumbled onto something far greater then he thinks.  Can the Doctor find out what Davros is up to?

In fact, I found it worth watching just for the characters.  Orcini and Bostock, the noble(?) assassins were priceless.  And Clive Swift oozes with icky smarm as Jobel.
To be honest, the guest characters are so strong that the Doctor and Peri are only vaguely necessary to the plot.  Always a good thing where Peri is concerned.

The rest is wonderful and the extras are nice.  Nicola Bryant and Terry Malloy have audio commentary on the DVD with Eric Saward who wrote the episodes and Graeme Harper who directed the episodes.

1390508,1,B000053OSI,"I try to be as fair as I can to the Sixth Doctor era, and I admit that I am biased against it.  I find Peri to be obnoxious and whiney, and I think Six is an emotionally abusive, badly dressed jerk.  However, they're not all totally bad episodes.  In fact, I rather liked Mark of the Rani, though mostly because of the competing villains.

But all things considered, this has got to be one of the worst Doctor Who episodes I've ever seen, and let me go over a few reasons why:

- This is a two parter (each part is 45 min, as opposed to the usual 24 min per part), and the entire main story takes place at a massive funeral home/cryogenic preservation center called Tranquil Repose.  And yet, the Doctor never even enters this place until the SECOND PART!  For the entire first half of the story, Six and Peri are literally just walking around trying to find the place, and then trying to find a way in.  The contrived cliffhanger, which makes no sense at all, involves a rather non-threatening chunk of styrofoam.

- A large portion of Revelation revolves around two wholly unimportant characters, namely the funeral director and his assistant who is infatuated with him.  With Davros interceding and toying with these characters to his own evil ends, this could have been a great opportunity for some intrigue, but instead these characters ultimately have absolutely no bearing on the main plot whatsoever, and I'm left wondering why Davros even bothered.  Is this what the great, maniacal Davros has been reduced to?  Eric Saward defends his script, telling us that this portion was largely based on one of his favorite books, but so what?  Does it have any place in an episode of Doctor Who?  Does it add anything to the story?  A resounding ""NO"" I'm afraid.

- The plot involving Stengos is so undercooked, they might as well have just left it out.  But as Davros explains, it was all part of his plan to lure the Doctor.  Sure it was...

- Genesis of the Daleks, one of my favorite episodes from the Tom Baker era, made great use of lighting and camera position to lend a menacing air to the Daleks and to Davros, and each had a wonderfully sinister introduction.  In this episode, the Daleks and Davros just kind of show up suddenly.  No introduction, no creepy atmosphere.  Again, a classic Who villain like Davros deserves much better than this, and I'm baffled that this episode was directed (clumsily) by Graeme Harper, who would later go on to direct some of the best episodes of the revived series.

- I've mentioned my feelings toward Peri as a character, but as a heterosexual male I must admit that actress Nicola Bryant is rather nice to look at.  In fact, given the hateful, belligerent attitude of Six, I often wonder if Peri's penchant for chest-baring outfits is solely responsible for keeping the series alive during what I consider the weakest period in Doctor Who.  Even so, I am denied even this carnal pleasure in Revelation of the Daleks, as Peri is wrapped up in a heavy coat for nearly the entire episode.  Fans of Peri's bodacious bod, beware.  You're better off watching Vengeance on Varos.

- The cryogenically frozen bodies at Tranquil Repose are kept informed about outside events (subconciously I suppose) by a sort of retro-American DJ, played by Brit comedian Alexei Sayle.  Now I'm sure this guy has been funny at some point in the past, but there's no evidence of any talent here.  His scenes, which frequently interrupt the narrative, go on far too long, and it's often difficult to even understand what he's saying in his overbearing imitation of American radio personalities.  On top of that, I wasn't even sure what purpose (if any) his character served until well into the second half of the episode.  Truly needless.

I will admit that the second part, involving bounty hunter assassins and the conflict between Davros' forces and the Imperial Daleks, was much more interesting than the first part, but it's too little too late.  I know, better than most people, that allowances must be made for a low budget show like Doctor Who, but even with that in mind, I'm afraid the negatives far outweigh the positives.  Thumbs way down for me.",1219795200,7,4181,4.665300546448087
1390509,4,B000053OSI,"Doctor Who, Daleks - Davros what could be better? A story with great sub plots and Alexi Sayle (not to mention Wiliam Gaunt and Eleanor Bron)make this one of the better Colin Baker stories and keeps on going right up to the end.

Colin Baker oftern had weak stories to play such as Trial of a Time Lord which took Dr Who to previously unknown depths; but always played the part with his own inimitable style. In Revelation of the Daleks he is at his best. For those new fans of the doctor you missed the best - for those of us who saw the first episodes in 1963 Colin Baker was one of the greats - buy this and see what you missed",1217980800,,630,4.080645161290323

I did not like Hartnell; I found Tom Baker much better in the role; Colin Baker falls between the two. I found him rather cold and distracted. The sets are better than either of the other two. The acting...feh. Not campy enough.,1196121600,2,329,4.238095238095238
1390512,5,B000053OSI,"Well, if the Daleks have a Genesis and experience a Resurrection, I suppose it only follows that a Revelation is in store, and besides, the sixth Doctor well deserves his chance to reestablish his credentials as their enemy. To do so though invites the very real risk of simply churning out a cookie-cutter Dalek plot in a perfunctory manner, and that is exactly what does NOT happen here. ""Revelation of the Daleks"" is an incredibly inventive and creative storyline, almost to the point of being weird--just when you think a twenty-some-year-old TV show is out of surprises, it goes and throws you for a loop with something like this. Of course, sad to say, it was precisely around this time that the show's future was cast in serious doubt, making the cliffhanger where the Doctor is disturbed at coming across what seems like his own gravestone one of those surreal moments where fiction seems to be mirroring reality.

The Doctor's not the only one to get the willies, though. There's a lot that's disturbing in this one, along with some pretty gross imagery both on-screen and off. Much of this has to do with the setting: the planet Necros, funeral home and cemetery to the galaxy. The nitty-gritty details of death, what it does to one's corporeal remains, and the nasty job of obscuring these details from the bereaved during funeral ceremonies (stuff we usually like to not think about) are always hovering around in the background and in the conversations of the supporting characters. But then we go one step worse with Davros using a portion of these corpses to genetically engineer a new race of Daleks loyal to him and using the rest to fund his research in that regard (How? Well, that's grosser than gross, but I won't give it away). Finally, increasing the funereal atmosphere is the extremely high body count, with people killing and getting killed at every turn, including but hardly limited to some old-fashioned extermination courtesy of two different sets of competing Daleks--even Davros gets his one good hand shot off in plain sight of the camera, poor guy.

Speaking of Davros, yes, he's still around overshadowing his creations (this is really his ""revelation"" rather than that of the Daleks, truth be told). I'm sternly of the opinion that he should've stayed dead in ""Genesis of the Daleks"" and only the intent to avoid beating a dead horse keeps me from knocking this otherwise fine story down a star on his account. Besides, given that like it or not his survival is by now a done deal, one has to look at how his character is used in this story, and it is actually integral to the plot and makes sense. Besides, he's a far more interesting character here than the ranting two-dimensional lunatic of ""Destiny"" and ""Resurrection"", more sinister actually and yet we get creepy little glimpses of his psychology as we didn't before.

Whatever one thinks of Davros, though, everything else about this one shines unambiguously. A great concept, a fine script, top-notch directing. There is a large supporting cast of different characters all interacting in different ways, way too many to list here and yet each one very vivid and distinct and memorable, each with a definite role in the plot and all brought to life by really excellent acting. Colin Baker is superb as the Doctor once again, witty and yet a bit pensive, eccentric and yet crazy like a fox, short-tempered and yet extremely concerned for the welfare of Peri--speaking of which, she's still annoying but less so in this one, and after more than a year Nicola Bryant's acting, while not stellar, has improved discernibly. Her chemistry with the Doctor seems plausible here, and her character's distinctive interests (as in botany and rock music) are highlighted so that she's finally more than just a pretty face for the dads (and teenage dads-in-the-making). Moreover, the sets are incredibly convincing: futuristic buildings with slate-grey pyramidal mausoleums in the background, tacky glitzy gold and marble funeral halls built on top of old stone catacombs littered with different and various votive images and religious icons--all just what you'd expect from such a planet and yet overflowing with just the right kind of moody atmosphere this bizarre tale calls for. And on top of all of that, we get treated to morbidly dark humor as only the British can deliver.

No wonder the BBC took Dr. Who off their schedule for 18 months after this story. Colin Baker was never good at playing The Doctor, and almost killed the show for good. And that stupid costume he had makes The Doctor look more like an idiot than anything else. Oh and Alexei Sayle? Not funny! I didn't laugh once. They do find some time to mention that Americans have such bad taste, but after this garbage story I'm wondering who really has bad taste.

The Doctor and Peri walk to Tranquil repose and it takes the entire 1st episode. They are attacked by one mutant in a pretty uninteresting fight sequence. The story turned into a confused mess of underdeveloped characters and ridiculous plot almost from the point the Doctor and Peri stepped out of the TARDIS. So save your money or buy Genesis or Resurrestion of the Daleks instead.",1155427200,8,945,4.5588235294117645

Thanks to the 2005 reinvention of the series, not to metion the amazing revamp of the Daleks, there is plenty of Dalek DVDs to choose from and get more sci-fi-satisfaction: The Daleks (from the 1st Doctor's Beginnings Set), Genesis  of the Daleks (possibly the best, see my review), Ressurection of the Daleks ( some great 5th Doctor moments).....",1154736000,4,517,4.733333333333333
1390525,5,B000053OSI,"The Daleks! Two words that genuinely strike fear into British children of a certain age, no matter how old they may be now! The `pepper pot' enemies of the BBC TV's heroic Time Lord - Doctor Who, made their debut in the second story ever broadcast from their long running serial and were so successful that they appeared and again and again in the subsequent 26 year run of the show and indeed made a stunning re-appearance in the new adventures in 2005. This pair of DVD releases from BBC Video celebrates two of their encounters with the Doctor, dating from 1975 and 1985. And they're both classics.

Genesis of the Daleks was the fourth of five stories broadcast in Tom Baker's first season as the fourth Doctor, albeit recorded fifth. It has to be said that by the time the mutant Skarosians met the Gallifreyan in this story, the Daleks seemed to have run out of steam. Their three appearances in the last three seasons starring the third Doctor, Jon Pertwee, were somewhat lackluster and certainly covered a lot of ground previously explored by writer and Dalek creator Terry Nation. Thankfully, when he submitted yet another retread of the Dalek tales, outgoing producer Barry Letts and his script editor Terrance Dicks, tactfully pointed out to Nation that it was all getting a bit tired and that perhaps a story about the Genesis of the Daleks would be more interesting. Nation leapt on the idea and came back with arguably one of the greatest stories in the entire Doctor Who canon. Genesis has been seen on the BBC five times over the years, a record for any Doctor Who story, albeit in two cut down versions on occasions. The full six-part adventure is re-mastered and released on DVD for the first time now in it's episodic format as originally broadcast in the late winter, early spring of 1975. It is almost a faultless story and the execution of the script beyond parallel. Indeed, although a fan of the Letts/Dicks era, I do wonder how it would stand up had they still been in charge when the show was made. It was left to new producer Philip Hinchcliffe and his script editor Robert Holmes to bring the show to the screen and this story goes a long way to proving why they are regarded as the show's most successful production team.

If you are a Doctor Who devotee, there are some niggling continuity problems to worry about in terms of the Dalek history that had been established over the preceding 11 or so years, but Nation has indeed done a great job in reinventing his malevolent creatures without too much disruption to their past storyline. The Daleks themselves play a relatively minor role in the story as the focus is on their evil genius creator Davros and his team of humanoid henchmen. The performance of Michael Wisher as Davros is truly outstanding and one of the finest and most chilling turns ever presented in the series. The regular cast of Tom Baker, Elisabeth Sladen and Ian Marter are simply superb and the guest cast dazzles. It is rare for everything to come together so perfectly in Doctor Who and Genesis is truly one of the best examples of such an occasion.

Revelation of the Daleks, made and broadcast in 1985 and starring Colin Baker as Doctor number six isn't quite up to the same standard, and will probably suffer in comparison to the earlier story, but when taken in context of Baker's short run as the Time Lord, this really is one of his classic adventures. Made as two 45-minute episodes and broadcast in March 1985 at the end of Baker's first season, alas the story came to air just after it had been announced that the next season had been postponed and the show was going to be off the air for 18 months. The BBC was blaming the overtly violent nature of the show as their reasoning for the cancellation, and this story does indeed highlight many of their concerns. But it is also a very humorous script, albeit darkly so; and again the performances and the production values do go a long way to raising it up in an otherwise mediocre season.

Davros makes a fourth appearance in this story, penned by script editor Eric Saward, this time played by Terry Molloy. Although Molloy turns in a good performance, comparison with the `original' Davros is inevitable and he may disappoint as a result. Colin Baker takes something of a back seat in this story, as do the Daleks themselves, which allows the assembled guest cast the chance to shine and indeed dominate. Clive Swift, Eleanor Bron, William Gaunt, John Ogwen, Hugh Walters and even the incomprehensibly bad Jenny Tomasin, really stand out in this story, with a neat cameo from Alexei Sayle almost stealing the show. Even the minor characters really stand out in this adventure. It's a shame that this story aired when it did. Despite ratings of over 7.5 million viewers (something David Tennant's much hyped Doctor is struggling to achieve), the earlier disappointments of this twenty-second season of the Doctor had rung the death knell loud and clear.

The extras for these two stories are as always superb. The six-part Genesis is contained on one disc, with commentary by Tom Baker, Elisabeth Sladen (Sarah-Jane), Director David Maloney and guest actor Peter Miles (Nyder). The quartet provide a very, very interesting and entertaining insight into the making of the show as does the accompanying disc featuring two lengthy documentaries. One covers the making of the show from concept to screen; the other is a potted history of the Daleks. There are also continuity announcements, a Blue Peter featurette, Photos and other PDF files accessible on your computer. The only minor (very minor) criticism I have is that the information subtitles that follow the storyline are somewhat repetitive of what features in the documentaries and the commentary and in a lot of cases are on screen so briefly, that hitting the pause button is the only way to read them. For Revelation, the extras include a commentary from Nicola Bryant (the Doctor's companion Peri), Terry Molloy (Davros), Director Graeme Harper and writer/script editor Eric Saward. Molloy is billed as ""Malloy"" on the sleeve. Oops! There's also outtakes and `in studio' footage from the recording, new CGI effects, continuity announcements, photos and soundtrack options. Full credit goes to BBC Video for such interesting and indeed extensive extras. These alone make the purchase worthwhile.

The Dalek stories that remain on the shelves are perhaps the least interesting from their canon, but if the folks at BBC Video can pull together the same quality of extras that they have for these two releases, they will be worth waiting for.",1151193600,8,6614,4.802458296751537
1390526,5,B000053OSI,"The heading says it all.  Too bad the next season would be Colin Baker's last.  He deserved more time on the show. If only I had a Tardis, I'd go back to 1986 and exterminate Michael Grade, but alas...  I agree with the reviewers who praise Alexi Sayle's performance as the DJ.  As Peri exclaims in her phoney American accent, ""he's greeeaat!""  Speaking of accents, most American accents on Doctor Who are very transparent. However, Mr. Sayle truly sounds like an American. The only detraction from this story is the annoying Tasambeker, played by Jenny Tomasin.  This may be a politically incorrect statement, but she looks and sounds retarded. Other than that, this is a wonderful adventure worth many repeated viewings.",1149638400,4,722,4.925619834710743
1390527,5,B000053OSI,"Revelation of the Daleks is a two part episode from 1985 that features Colin Baker as the Doctor.

The story begins with the Doctor and Peri arriving on Necros, mourning the death of an old friend. Little do the time travellers know that word of their friend's demise is a clever ruse to lure the Doctor into an encounter with some very old enemies.
For on Necros, everything is run by the Great Healer, who is making a fortune with his galactic funeral parlor and some rather sinister side business ventures. Clive Swift of Keeping up Appearances fame (known to fans of that british comedy  as Richard Bucket) appears as Mr Jobel, Caretaker of the funeral parlor, Tranquil Rose, who naturally takes a more than passing interest in young Peri.
But it is the Doctor who gets into the main action when a business partner of the Healer plots against him by hiring a well known assassin of the Grand Order to do  him in. The Doctor quickly learns the Healer is in reality his long running nemesis, Davros. Davros is using the bodies of the dead to further his new race of Daleks loyal to him alone.
But more than one betrayal awaits our heroes, and the Doctor is brought before Davros one more time, as Daleks begin desposing of those who are a threat to Davros'  cunning plans.

1390528,4,B000053OSI,"I'll be the first to admit that the 6th Doctor isn't my favorite and his stories weren't the best but 'Revelation of the Daleks' is one of the best of a fairly mediocre batch of stories (I'd put 'The 2 Doctors' as his best story). I always liked Colin Baker and liked the approach he took to the character but I just wish he had better material to work with. At least the 6th Doctor has shown some growth on the Big Finish audio adventures-check them out if you haven't already.

The thing that struck me the most about this story is what a minor part the Doctor plays in the events of the story-he's like a guest star in his own show. Still you can't complain when you've got Davros and the Daleks and some decent guest stars, in particular William Gaunt as the down on his luck knight selling his services as an assassin.

Amazing man and an amazing time in Who history! This is the pinnacle of Colin Baker's era, where the mix of comedy and horror which his era attempted right from the start finally fulfills it's promise completely. If you liked psycho Peri-choking post reneration Baker, grisly TV violence on Varos, hand crushing Cybermen and bad puns from the Doctor on Telos, and the canabalistic butchery of Vegetarians with a little help from Pat Troughton, then this trip to the biggest funeral parlour in the galaxy where people eat their own dead and your dead's head is inside a see though Dalek with brains popping out will make your day! Left unchecked, Colin Baker's era may have evolved into a work of art unsurpassed in TV history, if this story is any indication of the direction it was taking. Dark satire with slick style and wicked humour, this is the blackest, smoothest dose of Dr. Who ever. It is not for everyone and that's for sure, but what a shame we never got to see what came next. Instead, BBC head honcho Grade stepped in (he hated the show!) and the Trial of a Time Lord followed instead. Ah, well.",1085011200,5,1369,4.5465587044534415
1390530,4,B000053OSI,"The final story of the 22nd season of Doctor Who has the Time Lord dealing with his worst enemies, those Dalek pepperpots, only this time they have a really nice ivory and gold colour scheme.
The Doctor and Peri are paying their respects to Arthur Stengos, one of the galaxy's finest agronomists.  His body is lying in the Tranquil Repose on the planet Nekros (perfect place for a funeral planet!).  TR is a cryogenics repository where people with incurable diseases are suspended and later restored to life when a cure for their condition has been found.  At the same time, TR's vain and arrogant supervisor, Jobel is ready to make funerary history, as he has just finished the president's wife and is ready, with his staff to receive the president.  Jobel is played by Clive Swift, best known as Richard, Hyacinth's husband in Keeping Up Appearances.  He has a great line at the Doctor's expense.  After being insulted by the Doctor, who has survived a phony statue falling on him, Jobel retorts, ""If the statue had been made of stone I doubt if would've killed you.  ... It would take a mountain to crush an ego like yours.""
Then there's Grigori and Natasha, the latter Stengos's daughter, who break into the catacombs, where the vaults are.  She suspects her father's body has been stolen, and indeed it has.  But where's the head?  She and her partner find it, and it's being put to grotesque use.
However, that's not all the work going on at Tranquil Repose.  The turbaned Kara (Eleanor Bron) is in charge of a factory manufacturing a high protein concentrate ready to sell to developing planets at such a low price, their accountants are embarrassed.  Whatever profit she gains is being squeezed by the Great Healer, an alias used by Davros, creator of the Daleks and now master of a new breed of Daleks subservient to him rather than the Supreme Dalek.  However, not to worry-she has hired Orcini, a professional assassin and excommunicated member of the Grand Order of the Knights of Oberon to get rid of Davros, and he is dedicated.  He has an artificial leg with a faulty hydraulic valve, and rather than getting it replaced, he prefers the inconvenience as a reminder of his mortality and to keep his mind alert.  He's also conscientious, as he gives any fees he gets to charity.  Assassinating Davros is an honourary job he is willing to undertake.
Davros himself is aware of the Doctor's presence, but he has eyes and ears around TR.  He rants against Jobel, who refused his offer of immortality, and uses Tasambeker, played by Jenny Tomasin (Ruby from Upstairs Downstairs) a fawning and not too good looking female employee infatuated with him, as a loyal servant, and later, orders her to kill Jobel, who conspires with employees Takis and Lilt against him.  And he thinks the DJ, a prattling disc jockey, played funnily by Alexi Sayle, who pipes in announcements and 50's/60's music to the bodies in state, knows too much.
There is all sorts of violence here.  A leg is blown off one person, a hand off another, but Script Editor Eric Saward defended the violence as being realistic instead of the phony violence one sees in US action movies.  If you shoot someone's hand at close range, it gets blown off, plain and simple.
Saward had read Evelyn's Waugh's The Loved One, which takes place in a funeral parlour, where Aimee Thanatogenos, a crematorium cosmetician becomes infatuated with artiste embalmer Mr. Joyboy.  Here, Joyboy becomes Jobel, and Thanatogenos becomes Tasambeker.  Indeed, a line from Jobel on the president's wife also mentions the title:  ""she's a loved one who's passed on to pastures finer and lusher than those she knew in life.""
There are actually places like Tranquil Repose on Earth, but would they be economically feasible?  With overpopulation, future generations have no incentive to cure the sick from generations back, as they would be technologically and culturally out-of-date.  What could they do if cured?
A worthwhile story, given that most of the story dealt with the non-Dalek shenanigans going on in TR, but afterwards, it was clear that Doctor Who was living on borrowed time.",1078012800,12,4135,4.839488636363637
1390531,3,B000053OSI,"Even when I was 12 I knew there was something ""off"" about the Colin Baker years.  In the beginning I just wanted to watch ""Doctor Who"", so I never turned a critical eye to stories like ""The Twin Dilemma"" or ""Vengeance on Varos"".  I was only bothered by the nonsensical formatting of the episodes screened in the US: I didn't know that Doctor Who had been converted to 45-minute episodes, because they were still screened here in 25-minute blocks.  Each story from Season 22 had arbitrary cliffhangers (""Can you show us to this hacienda?"" ""Of course, it is this way"") mixed in with the ""real"" ones.  And that made no sense.
Through the years my individual opinions on the Season 22 stories have fluctuated.  I have ""Vengeance on Varos"" on my ""ugh"" list even though I loved it once, and ""Revelation of the Daleks"" was usually on the ""good"" list.  You had Daleks, and Graeme Harper directing, and a layered script with lots of action going on... what wasn't to like?
But tonight, I'm just wondering what the fuss is about.
Well, the direction is still superb, obviously.  Graeme Harper brings back welcome tricks from his previous story, ""The Caves of Androzani"" -- there's someone walking behind a hologram again -- but there's now expanded use of computer graphics, and a wonderful sight gag with the vertical hold in which the screen appears to start flipping.  The opening frames of the story show the TARDIS crash-landing on Necros, and the exteriors (a snowbound landscape with steam escaping from the water) are gorgeous.
Only towards the end does it start to look silly: suddenly, Davros's chair can levitate, and he can blast forks of blue fire from his fingertips.  The scene after that is totally incomprehensible, as a Dalek begins flying, exterminates two people, and then explodes into pixels for no good reason.
So this is, I think, a case of great direction crushing an empty script.  To be exceedingly reductionist, the supporting cast of ""Revelation of the Daleks"" is just a bunch of people with annoying voices, shouting at one another.  Every time Tasambeker the love-struck medical student raised her voice (""Meanwhile... find the intruders!""), I cringed.  It's neat that Kara, the greedy industrialist, has such great chemistry with Vogel, her administrative assistant from the John Waters school of acting, but it's all spoiled when another character has to peer into the camera and tell us they're ""like a double act"".
""Revelation"" is often compared to ""Androzani"", probably because they were both directed by Graeme Harper.  But consider this: one lacks the themes of the other.  There is no grand opera in ""Revelation"", pitting Morgus against Sharaz Jek.  There is no higher morality, of the Doctor trying to save Peri's life by finding the antidote.  There is no grand political bantering between Morgus and the President.  In ""Androzani"", the Doctor's presence served as a catalyst to change the motivations of the guest characters (Morgus, Jek); here, the entire story happens without the Doctor's involvement.  In ""Revelation"", Kara would still have been killed by Orcini, and the Skaro Daleks would still have arrested Davros, and Orcini would still have destroyed Davros's laboratory, even if the Doctor never walked into Tranquil Repose.
Maybe comparison to ""Androzani"" is unfair, but I'm still not convinced of the merit of what's left standing alone.  The tragic figure of ""Revelation"", Orcini, a disgraced space knight, prattles on and on about honor and noble self-sacrifice until he blows up an empty room (with a thousand unseen Daleks allegedly off camera).  So?  And the other incidental characters have been overpraised: Vogel's death scene is ludricous -- if the Daleks were truly scary, their death-rays wouldn't have left him time to scowl comically before falling.  Jobel's dialogue is some of the worst Doctor Who ever saw -- the TV series wasn't really about a mann who'd comb his toupee, or talk about nose picking, or lips meant for kissing.  Grigory (the definition of ""cipher"") is the most inebriated character in ""Doctor Who"" history -- he's even tortured with a whiskey hip flask, for goodness sakes!  This may have worked on ""Red Dwarf"", but not for the man in the blue box.
The best part of ""Revelation of the Daleks"" -- again, I'm going against popular opinion -- is the DJ.  Yes, he falls into the annoying-voice syndrome with everyone else in Part One.  But once he's introduced to Peri in Part Two, we see this DJ really is a decent guy.  Alexei Sayle even affects the best ""American"" accent we ever got in the show.  When he destroys a few Daleks with a ""highly directional, ultrasonic beam of rock and roll!"", it's a stand up and cheer moment, finally -- we're getting the self-aware humor that Jobel and Orcini so conspicuously lacked.  But when the DJ is exterminated, so is the story's moral centerpiece.  The only guest characters who survive are ones we really don't care about.
The Doctor's final lesson, that you can build an economy on flowers rather than corpses, allows ""Revelation of the Daleks"" to breathe again, to stand proudly with the lessons of, say, ""The Savages"" and ""Enlightenment"".  But by then, it's too late.",1072656000,8,5190,4.9378596087456845

7930139,4,B000053OSI,"Revelation of the Daleks is Graeme Harper's second turn directing Doctor Who after the acclaimed Caves of Androzani and this story has a similar feel in the story of the Doctor arriving on Necros where Davros has taken over Tranquil Repose where  cryogenically frozen bodies await cures to their diseases but Davros has other stomach-turning plans.

The directing is superb from start to finish. There are so many little touches that show Harper's competence behind the camera. One of my favorite is when Jobel is preparing workers for the receipt of the president's wife's body. The scene would be meaningless background usually but the way it's shot makes interesting and compelling.

The characters are amazing here. The DJ, Orcini, Jobel, and Kara could all be the most interesting charactern a good episode of Doctor Who. Having them all is really an embarrassment of riches. In the worst Doctor Who stories, you go back and forth between a wide variety of characters and situations you really couldn't care less about. Here, there's no character that's not interesting.

The story's tone is grim with lots of doses of black humor, which is appropriate as this is a story that's about Davros and there's no doubt that this it the second best televised Davros story ever. In both Destiny of the Daleks and Resurrection of the Daleks, Davros comes off as a very dangerous mad scientist. In Revelation of the Daleks, we see him as he was in Genesis of the Daleks, the most evil individual the Doctor has faced. The malevolence shows itself in how he gets rid of Jovel, and his callousness to the very idea of decency. He's the evil twisted mastermind behind it all, and he's one step ahead of almost everyone, but just like in Genesis, his arrogance proves to be his undoing.

I'm 300 words in before even writing about the Doctor which is one complaint many have against this story. The Doctor and Peri become one of a series of double acts throughout the first part and into the early part of the second. But the Doctor does show some signs of softening in a Season that was full of violence. He's comforting to Peri after the death of one of the characters and after she kills another who attacked the Doctor. He's very decent to Orcini and even manages some self-deprecating humor. He's superb in the confrontation with Davros.

Peri has a terrific scene with the DJ and you get a hint of homesickness and even a little joke about her accent.

On the negative side, there are a few details off.  Given that this was really a Davros story, the way Davros leaves is kind of anti-climatic. While there's a lot of death in this story, there's one particular death of a character who'd just blown up two Daleks that really seemed to be done just to create dramatic effect never mind if it made any sense. I also had trouble buying that the Daleks couldn't identify the Doctor because he regenerated.

Still, this is a solid story. It may be a little Doctor lite, but it has all the elements of Doctor Who at its best and serves to re-establish Davros as the Doctor's most malevolent foe.",1427760000,,3088,4.661764705882353
