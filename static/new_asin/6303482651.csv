661887,5,6303482651,"Pairing up two Doctors, one meeting his future, the other meeting his past, is an imaginative step.  After all, there was already The Three Doctors and The Five Doctors.  In that aspect, John Nathan-Turner must surely be commended.
The Second Doctor and Jamie try to convince Dastari, head of projects at a space station, to halt time experiments of a primitive time capsule, as the Time Lords are concerned about undue meddling in time.  The Doctor and Dastari argue, and then, Sontarans attack the station.
The Sixth Doctor and Peri, have just finished fishing for gumbeljacks, when the Doctor feels the effects of his second self dying.  He journeys to the space station, beholding the carnage wrought upon by the Sontarans.  They rescue Jamie and via a telepathic link with his second self, the Doctor takes them to current-day Spain, near Seville.  There, they have to contend with Sontarans and two Androgums (anagram of gourmand), the technically augmented Chessene and her cannibalistic counterpart, Shockeye.  Chessene plans to use the Doctor's symbiotic nucleus to program the Kartz-Reimer time machine and thus gain the power of time travel.
Classic Colin Baker lines?  ""When you ask a question, you should listen to the answer, otherwise you'll gain absolutely no benefit from being in my company.  It's in the province of knowledge to speak, and the privilege of wisdom to listen.""  To Peri: ""Small though it is, the human brain can be quite effective when used properly.""  In response, Peri mouths some profanity behind him in addition to that classic dirty look she fires at him.  In describing the aftermath of the Sontaran attack: ""ancient must heavy in the air, fruit soft, flesh peeling from white bones, the unholy, unburiable smell of Armageddon.""  His showing Peri smoking laser holes is reminiscent of Ben Kenobi showing Luke the damage done to the Jawa sandcrawler.  And his trying to use logic to figure things out:  ""But the there and then subsumes the here and now.  So if I was killed then, I can only exist as some temporal tautology.""
The Spanish location is a welcome change of pace.  I can imagine how much of the BBC budget was used, but with the inclusion of Patrick Troughton and Frazer Hines, it was well spent.  Two years after this story, Patrick Troughton would become one with the Matrix.
The Sontarans are taller here and different from their other stories.  They even have beards (!) and carry cool rifles. Clinton Greyn (Major Stike) was also Ivo in State Of Decay.  As Shockeye says, ""they always seem so tough and tasteless.""
Jacqueline Pearce plays Chessene as a calculating mastermind rational, calm in mind and beauty.  Carmen Gomez (Anita, that ""dark-eyed naiad,"") does wonders as a sweet and gentle human.
James Saxon (Oscar) has a wonderfully poetic line about moths:  ""moths are ladies of the night, painted beauties.  They sleep all day and rise at the sunset, whisper through the roseate dusk on gossamer wings and damask silk.""  Wow!  Upon seeing our heroes, whom he mistakes for police officers, he says, ""I can see from your raiment that you're with the plainsclothes branch.""  Plain clothes--Jamie, Peri, and the Doctor?  Yeah, right!
John Stratton enjoys himself as the twisted and hungry Shockeye, calling Peri a ""fine fleshy beast,"" describing human meat as ""so white and rancidly laird of the bone, a sure sign of a tasty animal.""  When Chessene tells him that Earth is overpopulated, he responds, ""By the time I leave it, madam, that may not be a problem.""
This is without a doubt Colin Baker's best story, aided by a great supporting cast, on-location shooting in Spain, set design, and a superb Robert Holmes writing.",1015027200,5,3682,4.943089430894309

661889,4,6303482651,"Nobody liked Colin Baker when he was the Doctor, including me, but he grows on you. I now think he was one of the most interesting of the Doctors, and in this story he's joined by the most slapstick of the Doctors, Patrick Troughton. The two play off each other well, and this excuses the glaring continuity revisions and whimpy Sontarans. The plea for vegetarianism implicit (barely) here is juvenile and hackneyed, but the scenes of Shockeye (a specimen of the Androgums, who are known for their indiscriminate desire to turn all edible species, including humans, into gourmet meals) lusting obscenely after flesh of a human for his cooking pans, are at once hilarious and gruesome. ""Pity it's not a jack,"" he says, carrying an unconscious Peri, and, ""Oooooh, I can just taste that flesh!"" to a retreating Jamie's back. Troughton excels, and this seems to drive Baker to great feats in competition.",1003795200,2,900,4.888888888888889
661890,5,6303482651,"Make that two:  The original title for the story was ""The Androgum Inheritance"" - and makes a more powerful title than ""The Two Doctors"" which is lackluster and vain.
The other bad point is that  the second Doctor is more like the 4th, being asked to meddle by time lord  superiors so he can keep his freedom AND tells his companions he's a time  lord!  The 2nd Doctor was on the run and kept himself a secret to Jamie,  yet here we have Jamie knowing it all...
That aside, this story ROCKS!  The Sontarans are back and in style.  Robert Holmes knows how to write  stories, particularly with aliens he himself created.  (the Sontarans are a  race of clones, bred to fight - Deep Space 9 took the idea and created the  Jam Heeder which were controlled by the Dominion.)
The actual plot is  impeccable:  Third zone governments set up an alliance to learn  technologies that the time lords possess, mainly time travel.  Dastari, a  scientist, augmented an androgum (a race of people moved by emotion and the  sensual, usually in the form of cuisine as presented here) to effectively  make her a genius.  In come the Doctor and Jamie who are appalled at the  idea.  Sontarans invade and take the Doctor captive, leaving Jamie  behind.
The sixth Doctor feels the pain of the 2nd being under torture  and sets to find him via information acquired during a mindlink.  He  discovers that Dastari is part of the 3rd zone plot, as are the  Sontarans...  they want to dissect the 2nd Doctor to get at a genetic  component which allows time lords to time travel.  Thanks to a fortunate  set of events, Chessene decides to merely augment the Doctor and turn him  into an androgum - to be a consort!
But wait, the Sontarans are actually  going to doublecross Dastari and Chessene...  who will win in the end?  And  will the Doctor and Peri become vegetarians after having to deal with  Shockeye, Chessini's underling, who is hungry to eat human meat as humans  are at the top of the food chain!
The acting, particularly by John  Stratton and Jacquline Pearce is exquisite.  The 6th Doctor is at top  notch.
The subplots are wonderful and are pure genius:  The political  intrigue, the combination of Doctors, Shockeye wanting to eat a human and  his reasons why, the Sontarans' trechary, Chessini, the idea of  augmentation, Dastari turning sides, everything.
The music is impressive,  too, particularly with the Spanish influence.
Best of all is the  locationwork in Spain.
I can overlook the bad introduction of the 2nd  Doctor as the rest of it is simply a feast for the eyes.  :-)",963532800,2,2570,4.654708520179372

I loved this episode back in the fifth grade  (that's going all the way back to 1985/86) and I love it just as much now.  The meeting with the Sixth and Second Doctor is nothing short of brilliant.  Patrick Troughtan (Doc 2) gives a perfomance that a bit closer to the First  Doctor than his character, but still retaining many of the quirks that made  his Doctor so charming. And the bits between the Second and Sixth are  terrific. Plus this episode features probably my favourite villians of all  time. The Sontarans!  And I think that this is their best (and sadly last)  appearance to date with what I feel to be their best costume design since  they were first introduced in ""The Time Warrior"".

Get past this plaint.  ""The Two  Doctors"" boasts a relentlessly inventive script, serving Sontarans,  cannibals, genetic engineers, fishing expeditions and captured moths  together in a semiotic feast.  And the Androgums -- feral, passionate,  haughty -- are one of writer Robert Holmes's most stirring inventions.  If  you're curious about the Colin Baker era, the Troughton in this might make  Baker's abrasiveness go down a little easier.  I think it's worth it in any  case.

662056,2,6303482651,"This particular DVD was going to be one of the last I was going to get of Classic Doctor Who. In the hundred-odd titles, this story ranks very low in my personal list. I saw The Two Doctors originally in its first run, and thought it a pretty good episode mainly due to Pat and Colin, and I tended to ignore the convoluted plot because I was a fan. Time has not been kind to this story. As others have pointed out, from a script standpoint it is absolutely impossible to fit in the Doctor's continuity, and from an entertainment point it is simply awful.

At this time of writing the review, The Two Doctors has gone out of print very recently (as the DVD catalogue is very quietly being withdrawn in favor of video streaming/download). Used copies are going for $300 while at least one third-party seller is asking $3700 for this DVD volume. Yes you heard right, $3700! For a story that was hardly worth acquiring at the original selling price (a steal at around $30). For the fan and completist I suppose it is valuable, but get this: you can get the story (no special features though), on Amazon for streaming and other venues for (legal) download. So it isn't like no one will ever be able to see or acquire it ever again.

My advice: Save your money; don't buy this DVD unless you can somehow get it cheaply and really want the special features. Find a legitimate alternative for viewing/buying this story. I may buy a download just so I have The Two Doctors, but won't get in a panic because the DVD is out of print. The DVD catalogue deletion is just going through the same situation as videotape did.

Note: The UK PAL DVD is still out there, but unless you have a Region 2 PAL format player you won't be able to view it.",1394409600,,1729,4.363354037267081

Like I said before, the multi-Doctor crossovers were always a must-buy for me & this was even better than I expected.  Although it was only 2 years before his death, Patrick Troughton was in perfect form as the 2nd Doctor.  And this was a great story, with good villains & a chessmaster-like 6th Doctor.  It wasn't 100% perfect; the death of Oscar was alright, but I hated the Doctor's line after it.  But still, at least 98% of it is excellent.  And I'm sorry, I don't mind it whenever the Doctor kills a villain.  He should do it more often, since that ensures that said villain will never harm anyone again.

While there the Doctor (Troughton) has come to Dastari to stop a few sicnetists working in the fields of space time. The very fields the Time Lords mastered eons ago. Dastari is upset but agrees and even indroduces his assitant an Androgum by the name of Chesene (played by actress Jaqueline Pearce) who has been gentically altered by Dastari himself. What the Doctor (troughton) doesn't know is that Chesene along with her servent the station cook Shockeye who craves to try human flesh have teamed up with the Sontarans. The Sontarans want the secrets of time travel and with it they need a Time Lord and the Doctor (Troughton) will do. Back with the current Doctor (Baker) He begins to feel as if he is in pain, a pain felt from the past.

662061,1,6303482651,"The most memorable Doctor Who stories all have one thing in common; they manage to mix suspense, drama and humor with seemingly effortless grace.  That is to say, they are almost totally dissimilar to The Two Doctors.  This three part yawnfest is nearly unwatchable.  Viewing this steaming turd, it's easy to see why Colin Baker was the least beloved of all the Doctors, although, in fairness, it's hard to imagine David Tennant, Tom Baker or even Lawrence Olivier salvaging this craptastic script.
 I won't even try to summarize the half-assed plot.  Suffice to say, the Doctors find themselves in conflict with two halfwitted Sontarans, a supposed supergenius drag queen,  an old man with a sword and the ringleader Dastari  (who worked previously as the lead singer for the Buggles).  It's all downhill from the word go.  Patrick Troughton spends most of his time strapped to a table while Colin Baker cowers in a stairwell and fails to rescue either Peri or Jamie from a cannibalistic old coot.
  The assembled villains possess all the menace of a cold bowl of porridge, yet our heroes spend most of the three episodes alternately hiding from them or running in terror.  Watching the Doctor cower in the next room, not once, but twice, while Shockeye prepared to butcher first Peri and then Jamie was just painful.  Given that Shockeye was an elderly git armed with a knife and a sword that he could barely lift, the Doctor's cowardice borders on the inexplicable.
 Putting two Doctors into one story demands a villain of epic proportions; instead, we get a ""genius"" scientist who not only leaves the keys to the Doctor's fetters within reach, but even makes a point of showing the Doctor where they are.  On top of this, the super-duper genius tries to make her escape in a time machine which she knows the doctor has sabotaged.  Idiocy, pure and simple.
 All this goes without mentioning the singularly amateurish makeup.  While the Sontarans are given decent appliances which allow them a limited range of facial expressions, Shockeye's makeup consists of some nose putty boils and poorly drawn eyebrows.  The word lame springs to mind.
 Unlike most viewers, I happen to enjoy Colin Baker's portrayal of The Doctor.  Despite being saddled with horrendous costumes, lackluster scripts and an annoying ninny for a companion, Baker makes a herculean effort to fill the screen and breathe life into the character.  Whereas others decry him as mean-spirited, I find him refreshing and mischievous.  Of all the actors who have played the part, I find him the most like the original Doctor, William Hartnell.  Still, I felt truly uncomfortable watching him try to save what I can only assume were supposed to be comic scenes.  I can not recommend this steaming pile of eel crap to any but the most dedicated fan.  Unless, of course, your idea of entertainment is watching the Doctor try to make Hamlet jokes while a hapless waiter bleeds to death on the floor.",1314057600,2,2960,4.881763527054108

Not only is Colin Baker at his best but we also get to see Patrick Troughton's 2nd Doctor back in action. He gets to stretch and be involved in scenarios that he never would have been able to in his own late-60s run. You're just expected to ignore the fact that both he and Frazier Hines are about 20 years older-looking than they should be, though I'm sure someone in Who fandom has concocted a rationalization for this. Once you get past that, his performance steals the show.  Since they're in sunny Spain, Colin Baker also gets to take off his idiotic frock coat for long periods of time which increases his Doctor's credibility by about 1000%.  The whole Androgum storyline is a riot and the Sontarans are back. Can't ask for much more than that.",1272585600,,859,4.5

I was a bit iffy about Colin Baker's Doctor at first (""Mark of the Rani"" was the first Colin Baker episode I watched); but the more I saw of his doctor the better I liked him - also, the more I saw of his companion, Peri, the better I liked her.  Everything flowed perfectly in this episode; there was nothing that could have been left out, nothing that seemed to be missing.  The characters were extremely well realized - especially Jacqueline Pearce's villainess.  In fact, I would say that her character was just about the most fascinating villain I've ever seen in any sci-fi show anywhere.  And Baker and Troughton's Doctors together was a near-perfect match; unlike the ""Three Doctors"" episode, featuring Hartnell, Troughton and Pertwee, which seemed to break down into too much bickering between Troughton and Pertwee.  Now to the music.  During the entire Tom Baker era, and almost the entire Jon Pertwee era, the Doctor Who theme lost it's ""middle eight"" - which, in my opinion, is what makes the theme great.  Without it, the theme is like one long crescendo going nowhere.  I've even come to enjoy the psychedelic theme from the Sylvester McCoy era simply because it, too, has the ""middle eight.""  Why anybody thought they could improve on the music as written by Ron Grainer and realized by Delia Derbyshire is beyond me.  At any rate, the loss of the ""middle eight"" has put something of a damper on the Jon Pertwee and Tom Baker eras.

I've never been one to be off put by the Sixth Doctors incarnation, but I admit that his views on the inability to eductae/domesticate an Andrigum was a bit shocking, though totally in line with his portrayal.  I was surprised to see Troughton's Doctor share the sentiment.  The story really moves along nicely, and the sequence of the Doctors in the restaurant is worth the price of admission.

662135,4,6303482651,"Let me start this review by saying that, though I gave it 4 stars, it was probably closer to a 3 stars.  I admit my bias in favor of 2 factors:  Patrick Troughton and anything Sontaran.  With that set aside, I defend the 3 star rating by making the case that this particular story, though vilified by some, has more positives than negatives.

Pros:  The Sontarans are back and look better than ever, though the collar
  on their spacesuits could have been given a little more attention.

  Patrick Troughton reprises his role as the delightful second
  Doctor (the one who influenced every one that followed into
  having a zany element to their character).

  Location filming in Spain is vast improvement over the usual studio
  bound look.

  Great cast playing well-scripted characters, brutal climax.

Cons:  As another reviewer noted, there seems little reason to have
  Sontarans in this story.  In fact, having been previously
  established as ""time-warriors"", there should be no reason for
  them to be extorting time travel technology.  Continuity blunder.

  Though called ""the Two Doctors"", they share precious little screen
  time and the audience is cheated out of some potentially great
  interplay between Troughton and Baker.

  I don't mind violent Who stories (Resurrection of the Daleks is a
  personal fav), but this one was rather disturbing.  A lot of com-
  plaints about violence in Who revolves around scenes taken out of
  context (such as the acid bath in Vengeance on Varos), but in this
  one, the normally warm and fatherly 2nd Doctor is practically com-
  plicit in a casual, cold-blooded murder (the truck driver) and
  this is never addressed in the script!  The murder and cannibal-
  ization of an old spanish woman is apparently never discovered by
  our heroes.  And I'm still trying to figure out what the whole
  knifing scene in the restaurant was about.  Perhaps ""just one of
  those things""?

  Story didn't justify having 6 parts.  Would have been a much
  tighter script with better pacing at 4 parts.

I had originally meant to write a more eloquent review, but in this case, I think it better to lay down ""just the facts"" as Sgt. Friday used to say, and let the reader decide.",1247961600,,2223,4.861035422343324

662137,5,6303482651,"I could probably write a novel about my tribute to ""The Two Doctors"" but I'll do my best to keep it short. My favourite two doctors from the classic series (and indeed, overall) are Patrick Troughton and Colin Baker. So it doesn't take a genius to work out that this story is my favourite all-time. Why? Simply of the fun that the story seems to have. It's as though everyone decided to take a holiday and make this story while they were doing so.

The result? A dark comedy would be best how I would describe ""The Two Doctors."" Robert Holmes's new creations, the Androgums, are best realised through him, as we hear about blood ties similar to Scottish clans like ""Franzine Grig"" or ""Quarnzine Grig."" Shockeye in particular, craving a human, and every time he manages to capture either Doc, Jamie or Peri, someone always interrupts him. You can't help but laugh out loud, reminds you of those stupid telemarketers who ring you just when you're about to have dinner.

The script is littered with one-liners, ones that just make you do a double take and laugh in surprise, from all sorts of characters, Oscar delivering some of the best, such as ""My father slept in a steel helmet during the war,"" What, just the steel helmet? ""Competent people, trained in the time of bandages,"" and when Doc 6, Jamie and Peri come out of the TARDIS and Oscar mistakes him for a policeman, ""I can tell by your raiment that you belong to the plain-clothes branch"" and the Doctor looks down at his outrageous clothing, along with Jamie and Peri, who aren't exactly in ""plain clothes."" Not to mention Doc 2 and Shockeye when Doc 2's been turned into an androgum and they discuss ""shepherd's pie"" which apparently is a cannibal dish!

Not to mention the TARDIS scenes, where Doc 2 and 6 abuse the machine in exactly the same way, The Doctor going through business cards ""Christopher Columbus..."" looks over at Peri, ""He had a lot to answer for!""

The difference between this and the other two multi-doctor stories is whereas ""The Three Doctors"" and ""The Five Doctors"" merely rode on an anniversary celebration (and thus barely have a storyto hold it together), ""The Two Doctors"" actually does have a story to it, and actually balances out both that, and the two doctors turn up by coincidence. People have complained about that being a weak explanation for them showing up at the same time. Uh, hello? It may be weak, but it's far more realistic than Borusa taking all five doctors from their timeline and then giving him enemies to fight, to weaken their chances of them getting what he wants (but that's another review) As Doctor 6 says, ""When you travel around time as much as I do, you're bound to run into yourself at some point""

And finally, the scene that everyone whinges and complains about (with such little reason to) Poor old Colin sounds so weary about it in the commentary, wonder what the count is on how many people have complained to him about it. I am of course talking about the Shockeye killing scene. I have no problem about it whatsoever. Come on, people, the Doctor was desparate. Shockeye chasing him with the strength ""to snap you in half with one hand"" What's the Doctor supposed to do. Just smile at him and say ""That's okay, kill me anyway""? And considering the Second Doctor used a machine to kill a Cyberman in ""The Invasion,"" The Fourth Doctor aged Sutekh to death, The Seventh Doctor manipulated Davros to wipe out an entire planet, the Tenth Doctor killed a Sycorax and on and on. I get the feeling people criticise Colin Baker's doctor simply for being Colin Baker's doctor. I would rather travel with the Sixth Doctor than the Ninth Doctor who let all the people down who were fighting to keep the Daleks at bay and then simply refused to use the Delta Wave because it ""made him a killer""

Overall, I wish I could give it six or seven stars, but five will have to do. Watch it as a dark, snarky comedy and maybe you'll get new appreciation for it.",1200614400,19,3962,4.5811001410437235
662138,1,6303482651,"I was really disappointed with this episode.  The writer, Robert Holmes, had been the script editor during the show's best times in the mid-70s, but this episode was basically tripe.  To start with, the plot was ill-conceived.  Sontarans, one of the show's best villains, were competely unnecessary to the plot - they added nothing.  Further, the Sontarans were poorly realized both in costume and in acting (much as they had been in 1978's The Invasion of Time).

I actually didn't mind the Androgums and their sanguine nature, but I think they were probably a bit much for the younger audience.

And then there were the continuity conflicts, which are my biggest problem with the episode.  The 2nd Doctor was never used by the Time Lords for meddling.  The Doctor had no contact with the Time Lords prior to the end of The War Games as that episode made abundently clear.  This use of the Doctor to do the Time Lords' dirty work didn't start until until the 3rd Doctor episode Colony in Space.  Further, the 2nd Doctor had never told Jamie he was a Time Lord, again as The War Games makes very clear.  It is therefore impossible for the Time Lords to have used the 2nd Doctor and Jamie to address their concerns with Dastari's time travel experiments and completley impossible for Jamie to know anything about the Time Lords or the Doctor's heritage.  Yet Jamie comes across as fully abreast of what and who the Doctor is.

A similar continuity conflict came up in Mawdryn Undead in 1983 with a complete re-dating of UNIT and the Brigadier.  It might be forgivable of a writer new to the series as in Mawdryn Undead, but it is completely unforgivable of a writer of Robert Holmes' history in the program.  More culpable than anyone, however, was John Nathan-Turner, the Producer of both episodes.  JNT did more to bring about Doctor Who's demise than any writer or script editor.  His decision-making on how to make and write the program was atrocious.  Why the BBC didn't replace him during the mid-80s hiatus I'll never know.  But The Two Doctors is a good example of why the program died a horrible death.

Any collector will want this episode in their library; I certainly have it mine.  But it is not an example of good WHO; it is rather an example of why WHO disappeared from the TV landscape for so long.",1199750400,6,2313,4.6339066339066335
662139,4,6303482651,"Being a longtime Doctor Who fan, I've always thought Colin Baker had the misfortune of being a very good Doctor but in an era with sometimes somewhat weak scripts which began to go downhill in the '80's and hit rock bottom with the McCoy era. I've seen Colin in other shows both before and after his time as the Doctor and he's always been very good. The best example of the somewhat weak script idea is this story which also features maybe my favorite Doctor and Jamie. The Second Doctor and Jamie look much older (Patrick should've coloured his hair) and their timing in the first episode seems a bit off but it's wonderful to see them together again and the pace does pick up soon enough. This is quite a fun story although the Second Doctor doesn't really have much to do except lying or sitting around while the others try to save him. However, the Colin's Doctor, Peri and Jamie do a very good job of running with the story. I understand some don't like the Sixth Doctor because of violence and sarcasm!?!?!? The Doctor Who stories always had violence in them, the Doctor could always be sarcastic, and the Colin era doesn't seem any worse than the others. In fact, it's some of these retorts that make this era for me and Colin gives the Doctor a life of his own. While given the talent in this story, it seems that it should have been a tad better but the only major problem with this story is that it could've been a little shorter and does seem paded in places.",1191456000,6,1471,4.391941391941392

662141,4,6303482651,"At the time this mini-reunion episode was conceived, the series was plagued with production / union issues, Colin Baker was given the short end of the stick so much so that come regeneration time he wouldn't even return for the transitional shots. Today, unhampered by these problems, Baker's 6th Doctor portrayal is much improved in the audio format currently being done by BIG FINISH PRODUCTIONS (some concepts of which have been borrowed by the new series compare 2005's ""Dalek"" TV adventure with Colin Baker's ""Jubilee"" audio adventure).

I remember the bittersweet rumors that the production for this one was to be set in NEW ORLEANS, but due to budget constraints the episode was ultimately shot on location in Spain. Oh, how cool would that have been to see the Two Doctors bounding from restaurant to restaurant in the FRENCH QUARTER!! As it stands Spain has a similar architecture and array of eateries, enough to serve the plot, such as it is. The second Doctor and Jamie (the namesake of the alias the Doctor uses in Tooth and Nail of '06)
are investigating ""unauthorized"" time experiments the Timelord deem dangerous, which in itself is confusing since at this point the Doctor is still on the run from his people (who ultimately catch and punish him in the 2nd Doctors final adventure War Games). Things go wrong and the 2nd Doctor may very well die there, if not for the temporal nature of the experiments taking place Doctors 3-6 might very well have ceased to exist.
The 6th Doctor and Peri find an abandoned Jamie who has seen this future, unless the Doctor's future self becomes involved.

Colin Baker (6th Dr.) and Patrick Troughton (2nd Dr.), have a great chemistry on screen, as the pair were family friends (Baker was college roommates with Troughton's son), although at times the arguments and jibes seem forced to mirror the abuse between Doctors in the original reunion show THE THREE DOCTORS and THE FIVE DOCTORS.

Some of the Doctor's tactics, let alone the overall whimsically cruel and dark mood of the latter part of the story, are disturbing. For example, the fight between the ""Gum"" and a limping flesh-wounded Doctor, to find the conveniently abandoned butterfly Cyanide as a weapon. Although the Doctor has on occasion wiped out armies of aliens (not to mention his own race in the current series) none seem as uncomfortable as this struggle for his own survival here.

Definitely a 6th Doctor story worth owned, if only for the history of the concept and the lovely Spanish locations, not to mention the return of the Sontarians and some great lines, like, ""Small mammals can be quite flavorsome...""

662244,4,6303482651,"You might get the idea that the creative staff behind ""The Two Doctors"" were augmented Androgums, for surely the presence of the second Doctor and his traveling companion Jamie is a bit far-fetched in this storyline and potentially superfluous to the overall plot actually, but who cares, because it's such a pleasure to again see one of the greatest Doctors ever teamed up with the latest of the time (Okay, granted, real Androgums would've included Zoe as well). It's a surprisingly good combination, too; in many ways Patrick Troughton's and Colin Baker's renditions of the Doctor are at opposite poles of the character's personality spectrum, and the resulting harmony of infrared and ultraviolet (some might say ultraviolent?) brings out the qualities of each nicely and gives each one a real presence in the story in a manner that one shouldn't take for granted. And you pretty much have to stand in awe of Troughton, who as an actor can perfectly fall right back into a role after nearly two full decades of doing other work.

Now as an adventure this one's pretty standard, though. We have the ever-militaristic Sontarans in an uneasy alliance with two Androgums, a newly introduced species and overall a lowbrow sort solely motivated by sensual pleasures and base drives (just picture if the Hobbits had somewhat malicious cousins)--this especially goes for Shockeye, a real butcher both literally (as a career) and figuratively as he goes through the story senselessly killing right and left while salivating at the prospect of tasting human flesh, that is until the Doctor gives him his ""just desserts"" at the end (a deliciously tasteless joke, granted, but I can't take the credit). The other Androgum, Chessene, is a bit more sophisticated, having been genetically augmented with a higher intellect by the scientist Dastari, but this latter day Eliza Doolittle ends up using her intellectual powers for the same base motives as before, only in a more clever manner. This unlikely and gradually unraveling alliance between the ascetically militaristic and the hedonistically dangerous is for the purpose of snatching the secret of time travel for nefarious purposes, and their capture and interrogation of the second Doctor to that end leads the sixth Doctor to their base of operations in Seville, Spain, where he must rescue his former self and smother the ambitions of the villains. A perfectly enjoyable science fiction adventure, but a bit humdrum considering that it was written by Robert Holmes, the mastermind behind some of the most creative and sophisticated ""Doctor Who"" stories in the show's history. His preachy hit-you-over-the-head vegetarian sermon at the conclusion is also unlike his usual urbane subtlety, especially considering that the ""meat is murder"" subtext was already readily apparent throughout the story to any but the dumbest clod of an Androgum. Oh well, sometimes even Homer nods off.

It's actually rather nice to see the Tardis crews end up in Spain. The location work is quite nice, with a wonderful old Hacienda in the countryside and beautifully quaint backstreets in Seville proper. Of course this particular location is in no way necessitated by the story per se, but then again hardly any of the overwhelmingly many stories set in England necessitate that location either (except for the obvious ""real life"" fact that the show is filmed and broadcast in that country). The only problem here really is practical: in terms of climate Spain is a lot hotter than England, and you can absolutely tell that the poor suffering blokes playing the Sontarans, covered in layers of thick rubber and leather and playing very active roles, are tenuous seconds away from a massive heatstroke. This makes them less than convincing as villains through no fault of their own. You did your best, guys! This Gatorade's for you!

Also a tad unconvincing is the Doctor and Jamie, likewise through no fault of their own. As with ""The Five Doctors"" they are visibly older, Troughton even more grey-haired and Frazer Hines no longer the strapping young twentysomething lad of yore. We're all supposed to make-believe we don't notice, but come on. And the second Doctor keeps referencing the fact he's a Time Lord and Jamie seems to know all about this, when the second Doctor actually tended to allude to his past and his identity only in the vaguest and most elusive of terms back in those days--partially of course because the character's back story had hardly been fleshed out to any degree in the late '60's; he was an interstellar man of mystery even to his own writers. So all this rings a bit oddly if you've watched the classic Troughton storylines (and if you haven't then by all means do so because you're missing out!) But again, it's such a pleasure to see them again, who cares about such nitpicks really. Just savor and enjoy the story for what it is, the closest thing to time travel we humans have so far: the nostalgia trip.",1186704000,,4968,4.990349819059108
662245,5,6303482651,"I have always loved Tom Baker's Doctor Who, but strangely enough when I decided to purchase Doctor Who on DVD it was this episode with Colin Baker & Patrick Troughton that I chose first. Given time, a new outfit, and support by the BBC, I think Colin Baker could have been a terrific Doctor. We will never know how good he could have been thanks to the BBC power struggles and stupidity surrounding the series in this time period.

Colin's doctor had a dry sharp wit which was a welcome relief after the blandness of Doctor Who #5. I also think that he and Troughton are excellent together in this episode and getting to watch Troughton, Baker & Hines all in the same episode was a dream come true for me. Though at the end it made me wish that Jamie could have stayed as #6's companion instead of Peri.

This is in some ways quite a gruesome episode of the series due to the cannibalistic subject matter. However, I found the Androgum chef Shockeye to be one of the most interesting/original characters to appear (far more interesting than Daleks IMHO). A very interesting episode with a good blend of humour and horror.",1184284800,3,1121,4.517241379310345
662246,4,6303482651,"""The Two Doctors"" is a two-DVD set packed with a lot of extras, which I really enjoyed watching.

The adventure itself, complete with its continuity flaws, is a good piece of pulp Sci-Fi in my opinion. You have two alien species conspiring to take over the universe while at the same time double-crossing one another, there are scientific experiments, explosions, time travel, and a variety of outlandish costumes.

But this one also reminds us of what was wrong with the Colin Baker years.  I happen to like Colin Baker's obnoxious, self-centered portrayal of the Doctor although most fans of the series do not.  The storyline moved around a bit too much.  First we're on a space station and then we're in Spain and there are extra characters thrown into the mix for no apparent reason other than to be killed.

The extras include a large chunk of raw, unaired footage, which I really like to watch because it gives the viewer a glimpse into the way the show was put together.  And then there's ""A Fix With Sontarans,"" which was a 7 minute mini-adventure created as part of another BBC TV show for a kid who won a contest.  Janet Fielding (Tegan) appears in that and quite frankly it shows me that Doctor Six and Tegan might have made a good team, the way they sparred with each other. I happen to be a Tegan fan, which is also not necessarily the opinion of hardcore Whovians.

This DVD is good for fans but may not be a newcomer's best introduction to the show.",1181865600,3,1464,4.5361216730038025
662247,5,6303482651,"I really liked this story when it first aired but after seeing it again for the first time in 20 years, I'm amazed at how much Patrick Troughton shines reprising his role as the second Doctor.

The story itself is very, very dark humored Vegan agitprop from Robert Holmes who wrote some of the very best stories, including Pyramid of Mars and Talons of Weng-Chiang.  But the the big reason to see this one is to enjoy the relish Troughton brings to his reprisal.

As an American born in 1965 I was in the wrong country and born too early to see Patrick Troughton when he helmed the series and the only way I really know him is from The Three Doctors, The Five Doctors, and this, the best of the multi-Doctor stories, IMO.

Everything just comes together and works here, from the invisible 40 scientists on the space station destroyed by the Sontarans to the beautiful filming locations in Spain.  Possibly the best story from the Colin Baker era.  Hard to say definitively until all the stories are out but very, very good.",1179705600,,1023,4.532608695652174

662249,3,6303482651,"When I first saw Colin Baker in The Twin Dilemma, I immediately fell for him.  He reminded me of the first doctor, William Hartnell, who is my all time favorite.  Like many others, I would always say Tom Baker (who was extraordinary), but I really enjoyed Hartnell the most.  Colin reminds me of him, in that he can be brusque, rude, sarcastic, and difficult.  This never bothered me.  The coat was a little silly, I'll grant you, but not the worst thing ever conceived.  Colin was the fall guy for poor writing and for needless violence.  This story, in many ways, exemplifies what was really wrong with the Colin Baker era.  The character, Oscar, is needlessly killed in a ridiculously harsh way, and it doesn't really serve any purpose other than ""let's kill him off."".  The character of Shockeye (great name, by the way) is a very interesting one, even though he is quite violent, killing Oscar, and torturing Jaime with a meat tenderizer.  The scenes that take place in Spain seem unnecessary.  And, yet, Baker is fantastic as the Doctor, and is well matched by Patrick Troughton's performance.  It was nice to see the return of a six part story, but it's rather ironic that this one is definitely padded, and when John Nathan Turner started as the producer of the series, he said he was doing away with six part stories because they were padded.  The overall story is pretty good, and it's wonderful to see Troughton and Frazer Hines as Jaime again.  Colin deserved better....",1157068800,4,1482,4.6937984496124034
662250,5,6303482651,"The 5-star rating encompasses the whole Colin Baker era, the most underrated in Dr Who history.  Colin Baker has the distinction of being the only Doctor not to leave the show of his own will.  In other words, he was fired. Michael Grade, BBC Controller at that time, took it upon himself to order John Nathan-Turner to replace Baker.  This was most unfortunate, as Baker brought a fresh, energetic approach to the role.  He relished playing the Doctor, even stating at one point that he intended to stick around long enough to break Tom Baker's record tenure.  This is a departure from the previous Doctor, who intended to stay on for only three years so as not to become typecast in the role.

The Colin Baker era is unfairly criticized for its undue violence.  While it has its violent moments, is it any more violent than the UNIT era (arguably the best era in Doctor Who history)? Or how about Genesis of the Daleks, which opens with a soldier in a gas mask?  If you want non-violent Who, watch the first several Hartnell stories. But even those contain scenes such as cavemen clubbing each other to death and daleks who ""EX-TER-MI-NATE"".

It took the Doctor six incarnations to finally get it. He understood that showing compassion for someone who's trying to kill you is ridiculously stupid.  He understood that it's kill or be killed. His ""uncompassionate"" nature has been targeted by clueless critics who can't distinguish between killing an innocent victim and killing a vicious killer.  The doctor's killing of Shockeye in ""The Two Doctors"" is a favorite target of these boneheads. I say if a murderous letch with the ""strength to snap you in half with one hand"", as the Doctor states, is out to kill you and have you for dinner, you do what you can to survive. Maybe these aformentioned critics would have rather seen the Doctor confront Shockeye, offer him a joint and sing ""Kumbaya"" to him like the pot-smoking hippies that these critics are.

So why was Colin Baker fired?  That question baffled me, until I read somewhere that Michael Grade was dating Liza Goddard, Colin's ex-wife, at the time. I fully understand now. A professional vendetta is very unprofessional of you, Mr. Grade.

Consider who followed Baker, and what kind of stories we had to endure (i.e. Crappiness Patrol), it was only a matter of time before the series was killed off for good.  Maybe they should have cancelled the show after Colin Baker was fired and spared us three years of 1-star stories, with a couple exceptions.

My opinion and I'm sticking to it. If you don't like it, or if you are one of those boneheaded critics, go ahead and exercise your only recourse by hitting the ""NO"" button if it makes you feel important. And heeere come the Crappiness Patrol apologists rating my review!",1147564800,21,2785,4.734989648033126
662251,4,6303482651,"Like most fans of the classic series of Doctor Who, I felt that Colin Baker was the biggest mistake evermade by the producers.  He single-handedly destroyed the best thing the BBC had going for it at the time.  Sure the effects were cheesy and the advent of new SFX technology betrayed the weaker production values of the show, but right up until the era of Colin baker and Nicola Bryant, the acting of the main characters kept the series going.

Nicola Bryant is whiney as Peri, and serves as little more than window dressing, very often wearing little and thinking even less (she remains one of the most visually apealing companions, right up until the brilliant casting of Billie Piper as Rose Tyler in the new series).

Colin Baker is brash and unlikable as the Doctor, styling the Doctor as a man of action on a crusade to save the universe thorugh sheer bravado.

The appearance of Patrick Throughton as the second Doctor brought together two of the most extreme personalities of the Doctor, and oddly enough, it worked.  The interplay between the two when they were on screen together was excellent.

The story itself is quite compelling, showing the jealousy of other races of the Time Lords and their ability to move freely in the fourth dimension.  It focuses on the desire of one of the Doctor's old enemies to acquire time travel ability for galactic conquest.

There are perhaps a few too many plot twists in this story, but the Doctor(s) manage to save the day, and the universe is safe from cruel domination.",1142899200,4,1523,4.695488721804511
662252,5,6303482651,"There's no way around it:  Patrick Troughton's was simply the very finest, most fully realized, portrayal of Doctor Who. ""Two Doctors"" marks Troughton's final appearance on BBC playing the Doctor; for this distinction alone, the DVD is essential.
The storyline is one of the best in the series, and, while the exotic (for BBC) Seville locale is of course unnecessary, Patrick Troughton and Colin Baker are quite marvelous in their differing incarnations of this most marvelous of all film or television characters.  (And after systematically destroying most of his best work, BBC certainly owed Troughton a few days in the Spanish sun.) Real standouts in the supporting cast are Frazer Hines, reprising his terrific sidekick work with Troughton as the stalwart 18-century Scot Jamie, and John Stratton as the chronically ravenous Shockeye.  Nicola Bryant is quite lovely as Colin Baker's ""American"" companion, Peri.  The plot involves a nefarious attempt by a lovesick Pygmalion-type scientist (Laurence Payne) and his artificially ""advanced"" creation (played very well by Jacqueline Pearce), conspiring (at first) with the bald, neckless, Telly Savalas-looking Sontarans.  They plan to take Patrick Troughton apart, molecule by molecule, to find the secret Time Lord ingredient which makes the TARDIS run (the operation requires that poor Troughton needs to be conscious, though paralyzed).  Some of Troughton's best scenes follow his temporary genetic conversion to a red-eybrowed, Jiminy Cricket-hatted binge-eater who gorges himself on a 12-course Seville meal with Schockeye. Baker's Doctor, with crucial assistance from Jamie and Peri, and from a holiday moth collector, manages to save his earlier self.  The two Doctors then go on to save the world from the predatory gourmand Shockeye, who had planned to consume most of its human inhabitants with relish.
I was surprised and delighted to see that Colin Baker's Doctor is quite engaging, though the contrast in skill and style with his earlier generation Troughton is decidedly in the Second Doctor's favor (despite the aging Troughton's need for a regeneration).  From the perspective of an American fan who only really discovered this superb series about a year ago, and after having seen (or in most cases, listened to, thanks to the idiot tape destruction policy of the BBC in the late 60s and early 70s) virtually all of Troughton's work, and that of much of the other Doctors, there is little doubt for me that Patrick Troughton is the definitive Doctor Who, for a thousand reasons.  His Doctor is always in actual and serious danger of death (or at least considerable pain and general unpleasantness, as in the ""Two Doctors"" experimental surgery), yet somehow manages to bungle or improvise his way out (and save the world, as usual) only at the last moment.  He rarely depends on ""deus ex machina"" solutions, but relies on his wits, as we ordinary mortals must.  His Doctor is a genuine ""human"" being, cowardly at times as well as heroically brave, quite vulnerable and quite flawed -- a human being who happens to have special powers and a fine mind.  His is a real flesh-and-blood personage.  While he's certainly funny (often hilariously so - there was no better slapstick Doctor when the situation called for it), he has a dramatic intensity, a life-or-death urgency, wed to very fine theatrical skills, that carries all before it -- lousy low-budget sets, sometimes less than inspired writing, weak supporting casts (with the very notable exceptions of sidekicks Jamie, Polly, Victoria, and Zoe), and general ""kid's telly"" BBC production values.  He sings the part in a way none of his other regenerations have quite been able to match.  (Such was his complete immersion in the role that he later told a reporter, quite seriously, that he had felt he had to give up the part or lose his mind to schizophrenia).
Scoring Doctor Whos is always a dangerous, highly subjective exercise, but based on what I've seen, here is my tally:  Troughton was the very best Doctor, with the great Tom Baker a close (but quite different) second.  Tom Baker's Doctor is invincible, virtually omniscient, never really in any danger, which is certainly one way to play this archangelic character (Baker is magnificent in almost everything, including especially ""City of Death"" with beautiful, doll-like sidekick Lalla Ward (whom he later married)).  Next is a tie between John Pertwee and Peter Davison.  Pertwee, hysterically funny and uncontrollable offstage, underplays the Doctor mightily, apparently in an attempt to restore some of the Doctor's original (William Hartnell) sobriety and dignity;  too bad he didn't let himself cut loose more often, as Tom Baker does. Davison is a bit too young (and handsome) for the part - more of a promising med student than a full Doctor.  Both are of course, wonderful, and no one would want to imagine the series without their very important contributions.  The same is true for the next rung of Doctors, Colin Baker and William Hartnell.  Baker, who is certainly animated in a delightful way, seems a bit more studied or less natural than some of the other Doctors, a little like the guy who had the lead in the high school play and then went on to more challenging things;  I don't know his work very well yet, however, and may well change my opinion with greater familiarity.  He's quite good.  Hartnell, who of course gets gold stars in heaven for being the first Doctor (and a very popular one, apparently, with 60s TV audiences), was perhaps just a bit too old and feeble to play the role, for the most part.  Many of the performances I've seen - including the highly regarded ""Aztecs"" -  seem ""phoned in"" and half-hearted, with Hartnell blowing lines and looking confused (some of this is no doubt the fault of BBC's thrift-conscious ""no retakes"" policy).  What Hartnell brought to the role that no one else has so far, is a very effective age, wisdom, and crankiness.  Richard Hurndall, who played the First Doctor in ""Five Doctors,"" actually out-Hartnelled Hartnell in this regard;  too bad Hurndall never again played the role.  As for Sylvester McCoy, I confess I've never seen one of his storylines (yet), and he might well be better than any of them, for all I know.
Of all the Doctors, Troughton has suffered by far the most from BBC's inane, shortsighted policies of destroying ""old"" shows, with only a handful of storylines now intact in video/ film format.  Other than a few saved episodes of the lost Troughton adventures here and there (well served in BBC's ""Lost in Time"" DVD set, which is most highly recommended), resort must be had to BBC's release, in CD or MP3 format, of the soundtracks from some of the greatest Troughton performances.  For those wanting to know this finest of all Doctors better, these are the best (and the not so best) in Troughton's era:
First Season (1966-67):  Power of the Daleks (just released in soundtrack plus off-the-air photo ""reconstructed"" format by BBC) - 10(+);  Highlanders (soundtrack only) - 9 (and introduced Jamie);  Underwater Menace (soundtrack) - 6;  Moonbase (video/soundtrack hybrid) - 8;  Macra Terror (soundtrack) - 9;  Faceless Ones (soundtrack) - 10(++) - one of the finest;  Evil of the Daleks (soundtrack) - 6/7 - overlong, but engaging (and introduced Victoria).

Even if you don't like this weird man-eating story, it was set in a beatiful setting -- Spain! The country side part of Spain! BEAUTIFUL! This would have be one of the most remarkable pieces of footage ever seen!

The commentary wasn't good, because they were criticizing the era too much. Colin was the only descent one who was making sense of the whole situation. We don't need any whinging and whinig on something that a fan bought from the shop thank you very much! If you didn't enjoy your era -- that's not our problem! Let the fans enjoy! People who actually loved Colin and all the other eras alike! That's the only thing that runined it. I gave it 5 still because I don't need Nicola telling me what to do! It wouldn't of have happened in 1985! I saw Jamie (can't remember his real name) who said (on The Mind Robber) briefly he was very fond of the opportunity to do the Two Doctors! And that's how people should remember the show!

Warning: It's a pretty weird and wild story, but it's definetly fun and enjoyable -- and that't the main thing.

Add to that the wonder that was Patrick Troughton and you have the best of all the multi-Doctor stories.  Finally, the story is long enough to suit two stars (the Five and Three Doctors are OK, but seem more like stunts to get ratings.)

Robert Holmes' dark edge comes back from the classic mid-seventies gothic era.  The wonderful Holmsian-Double-Acts, The Sontarans, and an odd twist on the theme of what is the difference between being a Carnivor and a Cannible.

For the casual viewer ... well, you might want to do some research.  If special effects are more important than acting and writing, then you should just buy something else.  Like a choice between a bowl of candy or a good well-rounded meal:  one is obviously more appealing than the other, but ultimately less satisfying.

I  for one  thought  Colin  Baker  got  a bad rap. The story itself was meant  for  New Orleans not  Spain and the  macrabe  nature  of  the  story fits New Orleans  better than  Spain. The aliens  would be  more recognized as a take  on  Zombies which is  a  wonderful concept  of magnifying  zombies as  a new super  race  being a bad  idea  so a  wonderful take on  blind leadership. There  are also some nice  homages like  the ""Madeleine Cluster"" which  Madeleine  was a character from Robert  Holmes  Second Doctor  missing  adventure  ""The  Space Pirates"" and the Spanish  music  a  nice  touch. The  story  would  have been less offensive if  the  Zombie  cannabalism was in the proper atmosphere but  it  sticks out  as going  too far  as  a form of gross out  than homage to  a culture where it was suppose to  be  shot  so some  of  the bad taste  comes  from  the homage  being out of context. As to acting everyone is  in top form  and the acting  is excellent. This  story is better  than  it  has  been  given  credit  for. Once  one  realizes why it  seems in  bad taste  it becomes less offensive. It  was also a nice bonus to see ""A  Fix With Sontarans""  which  although  short  was well done as were other  bonus features but  the ones  on filming  rushes  are best  left after watching the commentary which  some not  into  filming  sequences  may want to give  a pass on; best  for those  into that sort of thing. ""The Two  Doctors"" is better  than  it  is given credit  for  but the change in  setting does make  some of the story  seem in  bad taste and like all Zombie based ideas  not for everyone's plate  to  feast apon.

662336,3,6303482651,"BBC Video continues to turn out the quarterly releases of the Doctor Who back catalogue on DVD and the latest pairing brings two stories from the latter years of the series lengthy broadcast run. Although technically featuring stories from two different eras of Doctors (and featuring a third in a guest role) both The Two Doctors and The Curse of Fenric come from the very troubled final years of the show's 26 year run when even the fans found it hard to find favor with their hero's antics and the general viewing public made it clear that they could care less!

The Two Doctors was unfortunate enough to be on air when the show was famously cancelled by the BBC, albeit to return 18 months later in a revised and truncated format. Perhaps it is for this reason that this story is not that highly rated, but in all honesty it's more likely to be that the adventure was typically symptomatic of everything that seemed to be wrong with the production at this time.

The first six part adventure to be made and broadcast since 1978, this lengthy story was in fact broadcast in three double-length episodes at the beginning of 1985 in the first full season to feature the controversial sixth Doctor, played by Colin Baker. I've always believed that Colin had the personality and charisma to be a very, very fine Doctor indeed and had he followed Tom Baker and not Peter Davison, things could have been very different for him. As it is, his characterization was horribly misconceived, as was his truly appalling costume and he successfully alienated the very loyal and devoted fans of the show and the general public alike. By the time The Two Doctors was on air, one third of the audience had switched off from the start of the season and the BBC was naturally looking to see why. They blamed the violence enveloping the show and watching this story, they wouldn't be far wrong.

Written by probably the greatest writer ever associated with the show, the late, great former script editor Robert Holmes, this story had so many elements that could have made it a success, but was completely let down by some gratuitous violence, grisly, unnecessary deaths and far too complex a plot. Even the return of one of the show's most popular incumbents, second Doctor Patrick Troughton and his popular sidekick Jamie were unable to save the show. More's the pity since Troughton died the following year and this is hardly a fitting tribute to his contribution to the show.

When the program did make it back on to air in 1986 it was a shadow of its former greatness and although it staggered onwards for another four seasons, the death knell was never far away. The Curse of Fenric comes from the very end of the show's run and is possibly the greatest example of everything that was wrong with the production at the time. Essentially, from the very beginning of the series in 1963, the production team had always worked with their backs to the wall, with never enough time or budget to achieve what they were striving for, and yet, in 26 years, they'd always managed to find entertaining and popular stories that generally worked against all the odds. The Curse of Fenric was simply an unworkable mess. A good mess; a promising mess; but a mess nonetheless. It's staggering to think that a professional TV producer would pull together a script that was so incredibly complex and essentially unworkable under the show's format and then be surprised that the material couldn't be worked into the show's slot. It's only thanks to home video and DVD that we can now see the show how it was intended, which rather ignores the fact that it is a TV show intended for a much wider audience and not the select fans who will buy the DVD or Video.

The DVD set contains the four episodes as they were transmitted (itself a first for home video) plus a (second) attempt to restore all the deleted material and re-order the scenes to make more sense. Certainly it does just that, but I'm still baffled 15 years after it was made and I doubt it will ever truly make sense! Thankfully the writer has recorded a long explanation of how his story was meant to be. Thanks, but that doesn't and didn't help the viewers of BBC1 back in 1989! But as always with the Doctor Who DVD's, it's the extras that make these releases so worthwhile, regardless of the quality of the stories themselves. With the Two Doctors there are all sorts of goodies, including a great commentary from the main cast and director and all sorts of out-takes, behind the scenes information and (perhaps unwisely) a lengthy piece by the producer's ex-partner explaining at length how they unnecessarily set the story in Spain so as to get some fabulous vacation time for themselves. Oops! The Curse of Fenric commentary from Sylvester McCoy, Sophie Aldred and Nicholas Parsons is also highly entertaining and the extras on this two-disc set certainly prove most interesting, even it is all a bit long winded.

Doctor Who was never very good when it took itself too seriously. The fans love all the in-jokes and references to the past. But it hardly works for the general viewer who simply is baffled because they didn't see the story from last season that ties into this, or can't remember something from 10 years ago that drives the whole plot. Sadly, that's what Doctor Who in its final years was all about. At least these discs go someway to making it a little clearer!",1092355200,20,5415,4.658995815899582
662337,4,6303482651,"""The Two Doctors"" is the third and final multi-Doctor adventure, as Colin Baker's Sixth Doctor must travel to 20th Century Spain to save Patrick Troughton's Second Doctor from the hands of the Androgums, who want his symbiotic coding to give to the Sontarans so they can use their own time machine as a weapon against their mortal enemies, the Rutans.
The great plot of ""The Two Doctors"" is weakened by Robert Holmes' slightly rediculous script (A Surprise, since Holmes has been responsible for such greats as ""The Krotons"" and ""The Talons of Weng-Chiang""). The story suffers from such ludicrous touches such as:
-Shockeye's obsession with wanting to taste the flesh of a human;
-The Doctor's killing of Shockeye (which is more like the Terminator than the Doctor), and;
-The numerous scenes of violence, including a number of stabbings, Sontaran blood, and Chessene licking the Doctor's blood off her hands.
However, the great talents of Baker, Troughton and Frazer Hines as Jamie, the Second Doctor's Scottish companion, make up for a lot, and this adventure is good on that strength alone!
The DVD is great as well, with a humorous commentary and a great documentary on Robert Holmes.
Despite it's flaws, ""The Two Doctors"" belongs in anyone's collection of ""Doctor Who"" adventures!

662338,5,6303482651,For quite some time I have been reluctant to watch any Doctor Who stories that featured any other Doctors after Tom Baker. I was not happy with what I had seen with the 5th Doctor (Peter Davison). I thought I would give this story a try since it featured Jamie and the 3rd Doctor. I was glad I did! I enjoyed this story so much! It was chocked full of Doctor Who's magic sense of humor. Humor is what I think sets this series apart from most Sci Fi shows. I discovered that I actually enjoyed Colin Baker's version of the Doctor. Give this DVD a try if you were skeptical about the value of watching any post Tom Baker Doctor Who stories,1086652800,3,637,4.186991869918699
662339,4,6303482651,"Like many Whovians, I've always harbored a dislike for Colin Baker's portrayal of the Doctor. Abrasive, argumentative, and rude, it seemed as if this Doctor was a throwback to his original incarnation. While being crotchety seemed to fit the elderly William Hartnell and added to his charm as Doctor Who, in the younger Colin Baker the effect was rather off-putting.
However, I have to say that in retrospect, the lad was actually pretty darned good. I've picked up a few of Colin's adventures on DVD, and have come away with a new appreciation of his take on the Doctor.
The Second Doctor and Jaime visit a space station on behalf of the Time Lords. Some scientists have been tinkering with a time machine, and the Time Lords are concerned. However, the Sontarans attack and capture the Doctor and the prototype machine with the help of the station's director. They plot to use the Doctor's DNA to enable them to complete the time machine and travel in time. Enter the Sixth Doctor and Peri, who try to recapture the Second Doctor and save Time itself from the Sontaran warlords.
The story is rather inventive in ""The Two Doctors"", although the Spanish locations are kind of a waste since the show could have been shot just as easily in the UK. The installment was somewhat disappointing in that the cannibalism angle was never fully explained or exploited, and the 45-minute episode length works against the best concepts of the show. There also seems to be a spot of meanness (so common to the Colin Baker era), as one of the minor characters gets murdered pointlessly. The Doctor himself steps way out of character and takes a life in a somewhat glib manner.
Still, we have Patrick Troughton, and even in the padded parts, he makes the show a joy to watch. The villains are somewhat entertaining, as well, and the locations are pretty.
As for extras, there are two segments of raw footage (one in the studio, one on location), that give the viewer an idea of how the show was put together. Another segment recounts the difficulties encountered in finding suitable locations not only for the story, but for those interested in the industry. There's also a nice retrospect of Robert Holmes' work on Doctor Who, which is a loving tribute to the late writer by his co-workers on the show.
The best part of this set is the segment where a young Who fan gets his wish and becomes part of a new, mini-Who adventure with Colin Baker, the Sontarans, and Teagan aboard the TARDIS, complete with impressive floor effects. I love this segment for three reasons; first, it was very, very well-done work. Second, the kid proved to me that Colin's Doctor had fans, as evidenced by his costume, patterned after Colin's, and made ""by his Nan."" Third, and best of all for me, was Colin's Doctor talking smack to Teagan and pointing out what a mouthy, sour, pain in the neck she was. Teagan is the one companion that grated on my nerves to the nth degree, and one which I've always heartily despised, so full marks to whoever wrote the segment, and for Colin, apparently acting ""from the heart.""
Oh, and if all of that were not enough, let's not forget Patrick Troughton's second Doctor (along with companion Jaime) making a triuphant return to the series. That alone is worth the price of admission.
Overall, this is a surprisingly well-packed DVD for the Sixth Doctor, generally known as being the least-loved. If, like me, you never really cared for Colin Baker as the Doctor, you may want to try this one out. You just might change your mind.",1086220800,39,3531,4.687600644122384
662340,4,6303482651,"If memory serves me right, the TARDIS never materialized in Kitchen Stadium.  However, by the time the 2nd Doctor rattles off a list of unusual Earth recipes in Part Three of ""The Two Doctors"", and mentions Brillat-Savarin, and when Shockeye wonders if shepherd's pie contains actual shepherds... then it's surely no coincidence that the story's villain, Chessene, is wearing a metallic silver gown of the type often worn by Chairman Kaga.
""The Two Doctors"" is the best story of Colin Baker's abbreviated tenure as the Sixth Doctor.  The episode was written by Robert Holmes, one of DW's top scribes, and therefore contains literally pages of quotable dialogue -- and that's just in Part One.  The story contains the superfecta of ""Doctor Who"" tradition: the over-the-top villainness (Chessene), the quotable henchman (Shockeye), the duped human stooge (Dr. Dastari), and the prolonged gory death, complete with green ooze (Stike).
Not only that, but, being the longest ""DW"" story completed in the 1980s (not counting ""The Trial of a Time Lord""), there's a multi-layered plot which improves with age.  Consider that I'd always thought the reappearance of Holmes's own Sontaran enemies in ""The Two Doctors"" to be a bit of a time-waster.  With this viewing, however, I realized that both Sontarans are well-acted, with witty dialogue -- and, more importantly, their shaky alliance with Chessene allows for, as the Doctor observes, ""a double-double-cross"".  They don't waste time at all.  Indeed, by story's end, of the seven major guest characters, all but one are dead.  Similar to Holmes's previous script, ""The Caves of Androzani"", only a woman survives.
To call this the best Sixth Doctor TV story may come as faint praise, but it's impossible to overstate Patrick Troughton's importance to the affair, in his Second Doctor swan-song.  Strapped to a table for most of Part Two, Troughton still gets about 9 memorable quotes off in the first 9 minutes of Part One, and has a terrific turn as an Androgum gourmand in Part Three.  Also notable is that the story's climax is interrputed so that the 2nd Doctor and Shockeye can drive into Seville (Spain) for a lunch that costs, in 1984 terms, $233 US.  No-one pays the tab.
Also welcome is the return of old companion Jamie (Fraser Hines), who picks up the part after 15 years as if he hadn't missed a day.  Teamed up with the vintage cast, both the 6th Doctor and Peri (Nicola Bryant) are at their most appealling.  The best facet of Baker's tenure as the Doctor was his line delivery, and Holmes feeds him several zingers which he reads with obvious relish (pardon the pun).  Some great clowning, also, as the 2nd Doctor defends himself against Shockeye with a cucumber, and the 6th Doctor later brandishes a banana.
The addition to Time Lord mythology is interesting (and sets up the Time Lords as the selfish villains they'd become in later TV shows and books).  Less welcome for me was the 6th Doctor's sudden embrace of the ""healthy vegetarian diet"", although this part of the character would thrive for another 15 years; and his unsubtle dig at Christopher Columbus (who, if memory serves me right, is interred in Seville).  You can also tell that the Seville restaurant scenes were originally scripted for more food-friendly New Orleans, before budget concerns intervened -- witness how the 6th Doctor stages a mock arrest of his earlier self, by reading the Miranda warnings.  To quote the 2nd Doctor in Part Three... ""Oh, my giddy aunt.  Oh, crumbs!""",1068940800,2,3508,4.9573378839590445

This story features a full fledged return for Jamie McCrimmon, who does gets some nice action scenes is a great highlight.

The story also bolsters of the existence of Season 6B where the Second Doctor traveled time and space with an older Jamie in between the events of War Games and his regeneration into the Third Doctor.

Both Doctors had their moments, even though those moments weren't together. The Second Doctor was great on the space station in Episode 1. The Sixth Doctor also had a fine time on the space station in Part One and Two. Also part three has some very nice comedic moments and Patrick Troughton showed his acting versatility as the Androgum/Second Doctor.

The Androgums are not a bad concept for an alien species particularly for the purpose Robert Holmes created them for and could have worked well under the right circumstances.

Negatives:

There is a lot we could say but the biggest problem is tone and the inability to pick one. The middle of Episode 3 was a farce. The problem was it wasn't a farce at the beginning nor one at the end. Had it been a darkly comic story throughout would make sense, but instead this started off as a standard time travel issue with the Doctors previous self and then slowly turned into a farce with Androgums consuming impossible amounts of food, and the death of a character played for comic effect.

The another tonal problem was over message, which is delivered with all the subtlety of a jackhammer: eating meal is evil and everyone should be a vegetarian. With the Androgums being the biggest straw men argument someone ever thought of. (You don't want to be like a horrible man-eating space humanoid, do you? Then don not eat meat, you barbarian.) Writer Robert Holmes goes as far to have the Doctor announce hes going on a vegetarian diet at the end of the story which would be akin to having the Fourth Doctor endorse anti-tax politicians after the Sunmakers.

While I get that they were trying not to redo the five Doctors, its bizarre how little screen time Baker and Troughton share and the best they can do for working together is to cooperate on knocking a table over.  The rivalry between the Second and Third Doctors always made sense. Here, it really seems forced, as if its done for a substitute for actually developing a relationship.

The Sontaran design was horrible, with the biggest problem being they were too tall. With, Dastari his motivation for anything he does in the story is unclear including his decision at the end.  There was also little point to filming in Spain because the vast majority of the footage is mostly on a space station set, indoors, or around one house.

Overall, this isn't horrible, but its not good either and of the four multi-Doctor TV episodes, this one is probably the weakest. Still, there are some good moments and interesting ideas because even a weak Robert Holmes script is still a Robert Holmes script.",1427241600,,2938,4.716796875
