2664389,5,B000IZJQR0,"""1942: A Love Story"" stars Anil Kapoor and Manisha Koirala in the lead roles, with other notable names such as Jackie Shroff, and Anupam Kher. The setting is India in 1942, a rather volatile time when India was still under British rule and where there were basically two factions - the Indians that supported the colonialists and those that were rallying for liberation. In this context, a pair of young lovebirds find themselves torn apart by politics - Naren Singh (Anil Kapoor) comes from a prominent family and his father is a British lackey, whilst Rajeshwari (Manisha Koirala)'s father is actively involved in anti-British activities. The story focuses on the choices this young couple make and the consequences.

One of the highlights of this movie is the lovely score and the beautiful, poetic songs such as Ek Ladki Ko Dekha To, Pyar Hua Chupke Se, Kuch Na Kaho, and Rim Zim Rim Zim. The cinematography is beautifully done and the main actors deliver credible performances. This is another title I'd like to see released in Blu-Ray.",1273708800,7,1041,4.9147727272727275

8148073,2,B000IZJQR0,"Rented it locally a several years ago - enjoyed it with friends and loved the movie. Ordered a dvd for sentimental reasons.
Wish I had read the reviews. Thought ""Language: English, Hindi"" meant it had subtitles. The dvd box claimed it had subtitles. But, there were no subtitles.
Price was low enough, so passed it on to friends rather than going through the hassle of returning.
Will think twice before buying again.",1463788800,,417,4.805555555555555
