4124245,4,B003H8F3A4,"For those familiar with the AM for your week yoga DVD by Rodney Yee, you are in luck as I would say that this DVD is the next step up. There are 5 routines. They are faster, quicker and a little more demanding. I would say it is for experienced beginners and up. You need to know the poses and be able to move in and out of them quickly and correctly. The reason for only 4 stars is that there is no warm up sequence and this is absolutely needed for these routines. A minor niggle is there is no rest pose aside from where it is part of two sessions. Although the cueing may seem a little out of step with what is seen on the DVD it is very minor and does not stop your flow. I think that Rodney and his manner and presentation is brilliant and I would recommend this DVD.",1287532800,46,773,3.9615384615384617
4124246,5,B003H8F3A4,"Very clear instructions and balanced workout for beginners/intermediate beginners.  Some of the backbends are more challenging and may be better learned from a real life class. If you are mindful of your body though, you can ease your way into them, and this is a great product. Because of the length, I usually do the whole workout on weekends, and always feel great afterwards.",1286668800,3,379,4.921875
4124247,5,B003H8F3A4,"I love this DVD!  I love how it's broken up into 5 parts so you can mix and match or do them all at once.  I feel super bendy and centered when I'm done working out as well as at ease.  And it IS a great workout!  I alternate Pilates and Yoga during the week and between the two have developed awesome flexibility, my posture is great, my back no longer hurts, and all the wonderful core moves have sucked the ol' mom gut right back into place (I've had 3 10-pound babies in the last 9 years).  This is my new favorite Yoga DVD and I can't say enough good things about it.",1286496000,9,572,3.982456140350877
4124248,5,B003H8F3A4,"I've been practicing Rodney Yee's yoga dvd's for a few years now, and I had to praise this new addition.  Initially, I had imagined that this yoga practice would be similar to Power Yoga - Total Body Workout.  To me, that dvd feels more like a sprint where Ultimate Power Yoga feels more like a marathon.  This is probably because I do all 5 sections in sequence for a 90 minute practice.  Certainly, you could pick and choose and vary your workout as desired.  Being able to customize the practice (and enjoy a 90 minute workout on 1 dvd)  completely fulfills my needs.  I have to say, the workout is different for me than any other.  Rodney has really improved with age.  The transitions are very intuitive and the sequences are solid.  I would say that anyone could benefit from this dvd, regardless of their level.  Yes, beginning practitioners will need to work up to the backbend series, but there is much to be gained here.  I am happy to report that this dvd really infused my yoga with new vitality and mindfulness.  After I practice this, I feel more aware of my body than ever before.  I also feel incredibly strong, both physically and mentally, and renewed and relaxed.  If you enjoy Rodney's wonderful teaching style, you will find this a really great addition to your yoga practice.",1285113600,105,1297,4.602620087336245
4124249,5,B003H8F3A4,"I have many yoga dvd's (several by Rodney Yee) and I would have to say this is probably the best of all of them!  There are 5 different workouts on this, each with a different emphasis (core, back, all over strength, sculpting, and relaxation) and they are all very effective in doing exactly what they have been described to do.  I think this is a good workout for all levels, since he explains things so calmly and well, although a basic understanding of the poses is always the best thing.  As those of you who have his dvd's, you know you don't need to be looking at the tv screen to see what he is doing.  I feel this is almost a better all around workout than his Power Yoga Total Body workout.  Rodney is one of the best yoga instructors and I believe you can't go wrong with this purchase!!",1282953600,138,798,4.258278145695364

He keeps you motivated but isn't afraid to be quiet and let you relax to the music and just unwind from the day.  It is a great DVD that offers a lot there are 5 20 minute yoga practices that each focus on one thing (core, standing work, etc...).  I love the variety so I don't get bored.

4124304,5,B003H8F3A4,"I agree with a previous comment that the DVD itself will not serve well as a complete workout. The full length runs 95 minutes, with 5 sessions, each with its own sort of warm up and cool down. But it is very useful if I have limited time and want to try something specific. Like doing a sun series in the morning, the standing poses in the lunch break, or when I feel like trying some back bends. I use the restoration session as a cool down after Jillian's 30 days shred program, which is perfect and the time is just right.",1435190400,,526,4.166666666666667
4124305,5,B003H8F3A4,I love this dvd since it has 5 different yoga work out. Each one is short time period and I can choose what I want to do wanytime of the day. I do not think this is challenging for those who has been doing yoga a long time but I love it. I don't do yoga every day but I love doing yoga. I also do P90X power yoga once in one/two weeks and I love that dvd as well.,1431475200,,363,3.55
4124306,5,B003H8F3A4,I really enjoy Rodney Yee's videos.  He is extremely good at giving instructions that help you make the most of each and every pose.  His relaxed style really helps calm the mind.  I feel great after doing these!,1431388800,,212,4.526315789473684

4124328,5,B003H8F3A4,Great 20 minutes sessions that have very clear directions and flowing routines. I did 2 sessions a day while my arm was in a cast - the standing poses and restorative and because of yoga when my cast came off the doctor and his staff were amazed that my arm looked normal - as most arms have shriveled up after 5 weeks in a cast.

4124333,5,B003H8F3A4,"This is a FANTASTIC DVD! I have done yoga off and on for over ten years including Bikram, Ashtanga and Anusara. Awhile back I quit going to classes (too expensive) and began doing home workouts only, including cardio & yoga. I love this video, it is so simple, yet very powerful and relaxing, and is really a GREAT workout, especially if you do two or three (never done the whole thing because I don't really have the patience to work out longer than 45 minutes anymore. Oh well.
To those that say it is not challenging enough, I would disagree because the pace is pretty quick and most of the poses are just as challenging as you make them.....This is great unless you are looking for super advanced yoga (in which case I heard that his advanced video is pretty nuts) or hardcore cardio (In which case, why would you be doing yoga anyways?). But it does get my heart rate up at least. Rodney Yee's voice and guidance are so easy and simple I often do not realize how hard I really am working until the end and I'm sore and blissful. Seriously...I don't know what it is but this guy could probably lull me off a cliff....",1404864000,2,1121,4.368421052631579
4124334,2,B003H8F3A4,"Rodney yee is a good teacher; however this dvd is not at the level of challenge I expected from the title and content description.

4124337,4,B003H8F3A4,"So this DVD is great because it teaches step by step on the poses.  However, it can be intense I was sore the next day after doing it.

I also have the Am/PM Yoga and that is a 20 minute gentle yoga, great especially when you are still learning yoga.",1394582400,,324,4.03125

4124339,5,B003H8F3A4,i love that each set is 20 minutes and you and do as many or few as you have time for. A nice change of pace from the Yoga for Athletes by Rodney Yee (love that one too),1392076800,,169,3.473684210526316

4124351,2,B003H8F3A4,I kept Power Yoga and Yoga Burn that were done by Rodney Yee though. This one went way too fast ... I do yoga for the stretch and when folks have me flying through the postures it doesn't see to make much sense to me.,1391472000,,217,3.8444444444444446
4124352,5,B003H8F3A4,"I own at least five of Rodney Yee's DVDs for yoga.  He is a great teacher and clearly explains the proper way to do the poses.  And he constantly reminds you not to strain just do what you can - even a little is progress.  That is very true.  Over time I've been able to deepen the poses.  I can do some of his workouts with my eyes closed because I know what is expected.  I would recommend any of his DVDs, but this series is the level after the beginner's series.  And this DVD is essentially the Total Body Workout broken down into 5 workouts to do each day of the week.  I do this series and then I try the Total Body Workout to see how my stamina has increased.  There are a few poses in the Total Body Workout that are not in these and those poses help you move towards the next level of fitness.  I am devoted to practicing yoga for life.",1390953600,,846,4.0119760479041915

4124355,5,B003H8F3A4,"I am new to Rodney Yee and wanted some DVDs for my business travel.  Purchased this one and RY's intermediate yoga.  Great mid-level yoga DVDs.  I'm not a newbie but not advanced either. These DVDs are perfect- they challenge me while I'm on the road and that's what I wanted.  Great instruction and guidance on alignment.  Not yoga cheesy either.  I keep the yoga DVDs and a travel mat in my carry-on at all times.  Very happy with the purchase.

BTW- the hotels have been great at accommodating my request for ""room to do yoga"".  I just ask at the front desk when I check in and if the hotel is not at or near capacity, the staff is usually great at making it happen.",1388275200,,669,4.288

This is the first time I have ever heard of Rodney Yee and am wondering why!?  This dvd is perfect for me.  He is doing the yoga alone in a lovely ocean setting, quietly. He does not talk while doing the poses, but has his own voice dubbed in to give directions.  You can choose if you want simple directions, or detailed directions.  I find the simple is enough for me.  The poses flow quickly, but I don't have any problem keeping up or figuring them out with his instruction.  5 different sessions, each
15-20 minutes long.  I can't wait to do them all!!  The only drawback (and I won't rate it lower for this) is that you have to go back to the menu in between each session. Not a problem for me.  Love his style, voice and direction. Finally a dvd that I will use!",1365638400,2,910,4.142857142857143

I was looking for a second DVD to add to my yoga collection (the other one only has an hour long segment) and I really wanted something that was divided up into parts like this.

My only complaint is that they get the tiniest bit slow on occasion with some repetitive moves. For instances, I felt some of the standing back bends only needed to be repeated 3 times, not 5. But overall, this is a great video for targeting different areas and is a great workout whether you do all the segments or only pick a couple. They will stand alone fine. I also really like that you can alter how many audio cues Rodney gives, so once you become familiar with the sequence, you can minimize what he is saying and really focus on your own.",1362873600,,710,4.386363636363637

Yee provides excellent and clear instruction that a total  beginner can follow and metaphors that can deepen the practice of those who have more experience.

I own 8 other Rodney Yee yoga dvds and this one is equally the quality of all of his others.

I've actually never taken an actual Yoga class with a certified instructor, but feel that every time I play one of Rodney's videos that I've been through a full meditative, strenuous workout. Even the music in the background has a distinctly Eastern feel, and he shoots each video in a new secluded locale, so you truly get the feeling that you're indulging yourself in a one-on-one workout while on some exotic retreat, with a true master. I've been doing Rodney Yee's videos for years, and between his ridiculously perfect physique, and his soothing, confident voice, that I'll look in the mirror and look like Master Yee. Not happening, but it's a great goal to shoot for. You truly can't go wrong with any of his videos.",1331596800,2,747,4.753846153846154
4124399,5,B003H8F3A4,"I'm fussy about what I like in yoga.  In reading reviews, I realize everyone has their own style that they gravitate to.  I've tried countless yoga DVD's and pretty much kept going back to Bryan Kest Power Series and Janet Stone.  I've even tried a few of Rodney Yee's other videos but for whatever reason, didn't like them.  Well, NOT anymore!

Yoga/stretching had been put on the back burner for us because we already work out daily for 30-90 minutes and adding a 50+ minute yoga routine to that was almost impossible.  Enter Rodney Yee's Ultimate Power Yoga..... As I said before, I've tried some of his other DVD's but didn't like the flow or whatever.  I decided to give this a try because of all the positive reviews, and much thanks to all reviewers!  (One of the reasons I shop Amazon and give my 2 cents when I can)!

This dvd gets a solid five star rating from me.  The five routines are short (15-20 minutes each) which allows us to stretch almost every day, yet they can also be combined for a longer workout.  The holds are fairly long, and what I find exceptional is Rodney's cuing.  Even though it was my first time trying each routine, I didn't have to look at the TV to see what he was doing!!!!  That's huge for us.  We like to do yoga with no television picture, just ambient light for relaxation.

BOTTOM LINE: This dvd is not a substitute for a full yoga practice. But it's absolutely perfect for the following:

1) You don't have time for a full yoga practice, but want to maintain your flexibility. (Our situation at the present time).

2) You're a beginner and want to work at flexibility and yoga moves.  Or you just want to work on your flexibility. Period.

3) You already do a yoga practice and want to work on certain areas.  For instance, the ""Broadening Back Bends"" practice in the dvd is excellent if you have trouble with backbends.  I'm absolutely amazed how it loosens up my back in just 20 minutes!

4124406,5,B003H8F3A4,"I have been working out mostly with Rodney Yee's Power Yoga Total Body, and found the Ultimate Power Yoga DVD a very helpful DVD to alternate days with. This DVD has 5 parts ranging from 15-20 minutes which can be done alone or combined to make a work-out that you like. The first section begins on the mat and begins slowly with some abdominal exercises. Later in this section, stretches include cobbler's pose, open leg pose, and a stretch with your legs forward. As a general note, I find I need to do something to warm up a little to prepare for this stretching. I suggest anything of about 15 or 20 minutes to get the heart and lungs working prior to doing this DVD. I do tai chi before this. A great follow-up section to this is the second section. In this section, you begin in mountain pose and do basic sun salutations culminating in a sequence that includes forward folds, chair pose, back bends, downward dog, cobra pose, and warrior 1. I think this is a good work-out to leave off with if you are on the go and going to do things, but I feel that I personally need something else as I do my practice in the evening. This section kind of leaves you standing in mountain pose. At the moment I continue my routine by skipping the 3rd section because it moves too fast for me and does standing poses from side to side. The first pose after mountain pose I believe is the triangle pose. I am quite flexible in my forward fold, but find I need time and much more of a build up to do triangle poses properly - time which this section of the DVD does not give you. So, at the moment I don't not use this section. I skip to the 4th section, a nice section on backbends. Just be aware that it is building up to include the reverse bow -  but it does follow with some relaxation after to restore the body. The last section compliments this section well with slow standing stretches - simple forward fold, wide stance forward folds, and others, and ends on the floor with seated stretches (at this point you should be ready for these!) So in summary, even though I don't use the 3rd section yet, the other sections are a nice slow progression. The first 2 sections go well together, as do the last 2 sections. Or, if you have time for about an hour work out - sections 1,2, and 3 and 4 make a nice work out. Just bear in mind this won't include any standing balances (i.e. half moon pose, warrior 2, warrior 3, triangle, side stretch poses). Overall, a nice DVD - Rodney as always is a modest and unassuming male teacher - a great model for male students such as myself who want to see what the potential of the male body is. The audio options are full descriptions or shortened instruction when you become more familiar with the work-outs. Rodney narrates the entire DVD and demonstrates all of the lessons.",1313020800,14,2808,4.338403041825095

It doesn't hurt that the backdrop is on the beach of what looks like Hawaii (doesn't say on the jacket where, but I'd guess the Big Island).  Power yoga is the way to go for me over all the other types of yoga. This video, however, is especially my favorite because of how it's broken into 5 20-min. segments. If I only have 20 mins, I can cue in on which area I would like to focus for the day.  Or, I could do a whole 1.5 hours based on the menu set up.

However, if I skip the first 5 minutes of each section of the workout, it is quite good. He seems to take a little bit to warm up to it.",1301616000,5,349,3.8472222222222223
4124411,3,B003H8F3A4,"I really want to like this DVD because of the way it's divided into short segments. I liked the idea of mixing them up to do my own routine and having the option to do a shorter routine some days than others.

However, I don't find it challenging at all and really don't like the pace of the routines. Perhaps a beginner would like it, or maybe someone who has done other yoga styles and wants to see what power yoga is like? To put it in perspective, I am actually out of practice (since having kids 6 years ago) and trying to get back into yoga. I took power and ""hot yoga"" (not true bikram though) for 5 or 6 years before that. So it's not like I'm a yoga teacher or super committed yogi and I thought I'd need to start back into gradually, yet I still find this way too easy.

All of the routines start out so slow, it doesn't seem like power yoga at all and frankly it's boring and uninspiring. Then they reach a point where they suddenly switch to a faster pace that doesn't allow you to ""settle in"" or fine tune each asana at all before switching to the next one. Even in power yoga classes my instructors have always emphasized fine tuning each position if only for a few seconds. The Sun Salutations section is an example of this. He starts out with what seem like ""baby"" sun salutations and until about 13 minutes into the segment it is really slow; then suddenly the speed picks up and goes so fast you don't really have a chance to perfect your practice or get the full benefit (in my opinion).

There is also very little instruction along with each asana to help you fine tune, and no suggestions for making each pose easier/more difficult. So once you've done this video a handful of times, it can't really take you anywhere new.

Also, like someone else mentioned the audio and movement don't seem to sync up correctly. I thought it might be b/c I'm running it on my laptop, but if others have had the experience maybe not.

It's not really a bad video, but not what I had in mind at all and I'll be searching for something more challenging and with more emphasis on proper technique and modifications that will advance my practice.",1300924800,33,2147,4.330845771144278

4124413,5,B003H8F3A4,What I love about Mr. Yee's video's is that his directions are so clear and concise that you can follow along without peaking at the video to see what the heck he is doing.  And he doesn't fill up space with talk that is not directly related to what you are doing right this moment.,1297468800,,282,4.127272727272727
4124414,4,B003H8F3A4,"First off, let me say I am a fan of Rodney Yee, and have done his ""Power Yoga, Total Body"" workout everyday for almost three years. I was excited to hear of this release, but am a little disappointed. Many critics of PYTB stated the flow was too fast and the poses too difficult for beginners.  Apparently Yee listened to this feedback and developed ""Ultimate Power Yoga"" as a result.

I was a beginner three years ago and yes, PYTB was a very challenging work out. I started out by modifying poses, using blocks and straps, and little by little perfected each pose.  I lost 50 pounds using that work out, had more energy, and never had to change my diet.  No I'm not trying to review PYTB, my point is coming.  ""Ultimate Power Yoga"" draws most of the poses of its predecessor, but spread over 5 workouts.  He slows things down tremendously, almost to the point that his verbal instructions are ahead of the next pose.

So what am I basing my 4 star rating on?  My expectations were high on this release.  I wanted, like PYTB, a workout that was concise, a rigorous flow that worked the entire body, and a continuous flow that did not lag or stagnate.  When I read the description, it sounded like you could combine workouts without delay or having to use your remote, that you could program the workouts ahead of time.  This is not the case.

Beginners, and people who have a lot of time to do yoga, will like this release, but to get the ""total body"" effect, plan on doing 95 minutes.  To me, it has too many warm up poses at the beginning of each of the 5 workouts and this makes me cool down when combining them.  To its credit, I have incorporated many new poses into the PYTB workout and have developed a customized workout using both.  I am also going to add an evening workout using the first workout entitled ""Power Foundations"", a twenty minute set of floor poses that give you a good stretch.

  This DVD consists of 5 workouts which include:

1. Power Foundation (20 minutes) This routine will awaken your spirit and increase core stability for improved balance and stamina.

2. Strengthening Sun Salutations (20 minutes) Flowing sequence of Sun Salutations will help build strength and flexibility. (Alternate Audio Tracks)

3. Sculpting Standing Poses (15 minutes) Standing leg focused yoga poses will build power and alignment, (Alternate Audio Tracks)

4. Broadening Back Bends (20 minutes) Strengthen and restore the spine to its natural alignment as you improve range of motion and stamina. (Alternate Audio Tracks)

5. Ultimate Power Restoration (20 minutes) Relax and release built-up tension with a series of forward bends and slow, elongated stretches.

Am I being too tough on this release?  Possibly.  I struggled with whether to give it 4 or 5 stars.  Newcomers to Yoga will probably really like this.  Yee obviously listened to his critics by slowing things down and making poses easier to perfect.  For me, the challenge is not as great as PYTB, stopping to get to the next workout disrupts the flow, and the flow seems choppy in general during each of the workouts. PYTB now seems like the Readers Digest version of this release.  As mentioned before I did get new ideas on how to modify and mix things up a bit to customize my present workout.  Had I not discovered PYTB, I would be content with this release and probably be very happy.  If you are like me, and have time constraints in the morning and want a concise, rigorous flow with poses that work the entire body, go with ""Power Yoga, Total Body"", and use poses from this DVD to get more variety.

I do not want to discourage anyone from getting this DVD.  Yee's DVDs are the best workouts out there, imho.  The important thing is to do yoga.  I'm 52 years old and the benefits of yoga, for me, are too numerous to list. Yoga was my answer to my mid life crisis. Definitely cheaper than buying a red Porsche.
This DVD does deserve a place on your exercise/fitness shelf.",1296864000,79,3956,4.5934379457917265
4124415,5,B003H8F3A4,"There are 5 workouts, that you can do all together and one at a time.  It gives my workout a nice variety that each day is something different.  His voice is nice and calm and explains things so clearly that I do not stretch my neck trying to see what he is doing. It is easy to follow along.  He does such a nice stretch that my flexibillity has increased greatly in the one week I have been doing the video.",1296000000,,409,4.0246913580246915
4124416,5,B003H8F3A4,I'm a big Rodney Yee fan and after doing AM Yoga for your week for quite a long time I needed something more but with the same allotment of time. This is perfect! It's similar to AM yoga but as another reviewer stated it's like the next step up. If you like Rodney's style of Yoga and DVDs you will not be disappointed in this one.,1296000000,3,331,4.03030303030303
4124417,4,B003H8F3A4,"This yoga DVD would rate more like a 3.5, but there are no half stars.  I've done yoga for many years both at home with videos and at studio classes.
Pros...
-option to select specific 20 minute segments
-price
-includes a variety of poses
-fairly decent verbal descriptions of poses and good visual demonstrations of poses
Cons...
-he moves too quickly through each pose to fully feel the stretches",1295654400,2,399,4.782608695652174
4124418,3,B003H8F3A4,"I hate to disagree with everybody else's enthusiastic reviews but I do not feel that this dvd is as good as everyone says.  The workout is really nice.  It is gentle and at first I thought I was not going to get a good workout however when done I felt great!  It's everything else related to the DVD that I'm not crazy about.  The voice instruction does not really sync up with the workout.  It feels like there's too much talking in some spots then in others I feel I am instructed to move to a new pose way too early.  The workout just doesn't seem to flow with the dialogue.  I set the audio to minimal which is better...  And why are there credits after the first segment?  The DVD description also led me to believe that I could personalize the order of the workout.  If I can't do that, I wish I could elect to have the segments flow into another without stopping at the end of each.  I think I like Total Body Workout much better.  Sorry, I do love Rodney Yee's style and was so excited to get this DVD but disappointed.",1295481600,7,1027,4.183673469387755
4124419,4,B003H8F3A4,"I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 for its' misleading title, not because it wasn't a good basic yoga dvd.  I was expecting Power yoga since it's in the title but it's definitely NOT power yoga.  A good dvd for beginners.  I enjoyed it but felt unchallenged and I'm kind of a beginner.  Lots of stretching and makes you feel really good at the end.  Again, if you're looking for Power yoga buy a different dvd.",1295222400,,406,4.220779220779221

It was very different than the ""Total Power Yoga workout""  I must say I was very relaxed after I was finished with this one. I recomend this DVD to everyone!",1295049600,,327,3.9393939393939394

4124422,5,B003H8F3A4,"""Ultimate Power Yoga"" has five 20-minute workouts. The difficulty is perfect for someone who finds&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-M-Yoga-for-Your-Week/dp/B000YV1L4E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A.M. Yoga for Your Week</a>&nbsp;a bit too easy. The target audience is people who have done Yoga long enough that they only need a brief warm-up, know the basic Hatha Yoga positions (e.g., downward facing dog) and don't need the instructor to talk them through 5-minutes of guided Corpse Pose at the end of a workout. This workout is not intended for beginners (i.e., people who have done little or no yoga before).

The workouts on this DVD are each about 20-minutes long -- perfect for me to do at home in the morning, before going to work. The moves are not usually that difficult, but the pace, durration and combinations make these challenging workouts.  To increase the intensity, simply combine two or three into a 40 or 60 minute workout.  The workouts combine easily and gracefully into longer workouts. Now that I am used to them, the short warmups feel VERY appropriate to me, as do the short cool-downs.

The body emphasis has changed from A.M. Yoga. Here, there are a lot more backbends and abdominal strengthening work. This is very welcome to me, as I believe A.M. Yoga (which I did about 5 times a week for 6 months) was a bit weak in those areas. The workout emphases are:
- hip opening and abdominal strength (has the feeling of a warmup or easy workout for lazy days)
- sun salutations (builds from easy to hard, learn how to do them right, backbend emphasis)
- standing Yoga
- backbends (front of thighs, hips, spine)
- forward bends (surprisingly exhausting; then the second half has the feeling of a cooldown)

The overall ""mood"" of this tape is that Rodney Yee took a 100 minute workout and divided it into 20 minute segments that could be done in isolation.  The 100 minute workout (all 5 sessions) is probably better theoretically, but I don't have that much time all at once or, let's face it, the strength or endurance.

Highly recommended!",1294704000,5,2106,5.051873198847262

4124424,2,B003H8F3A4,I Love Rodney but this DVD is too easy. Its beautiful and graceful. His voice is terrific.  I spent more time looking at the lovely back ground.  If you are advanced or want to go deeper this is not for you. It is peaceful and if that's what you are going for then its perfect for you.,1294185600,6,285,3.982456140350877

4124427,4,B003H8F3A4,"I really liked A.M yoga for your week so I wanted to get this one since it also have 5 practices each focusing on a different type of poses. According the advertisement I thought there would be a matrix so you can play each segment in each order you want but there is no such option, you have to pick a workout you want from the menu. The first segment focuses on some core strength and some stretches but I found it to be good for a gentle warmup or even better - a cooldown, it's not much of a workout. another weird thing, there's credits after that first segment which made me think it was meant to be a closing sequence originally but maybe it's just poor editing. The 20 minute sun salutation is the only segment you could call power yoga since it is more fast paced than the others and does make you sweat. The rest of the practices are nice and slow paced and good when I actually don't feel like a power or vinyasa type yoga. In the standing poses segment there's warrior 3 and half moon, a nice addition to the very basic standing segment on the A.M dvd. I also liked the backbends segment which is probably the most advanced, some nice preparations and I liked that he added side bow which you don't often see in DVD's as well as camel, bow and 2 rounds of wheel.
The last restoration segment is made of long forward bends, first standing and then sitting. The disappointments - no matrix, no twisting postures, no inversions and no shavasana in all of the segments!!! but I still like it as a slower practice.",1288310400,8,1521,4.303135888501743
4124428,4,B003H8F3A4,"Newer yoga DVDs are offering the yoga practitioner the opportunity to personalize their practice by giving them segments of yoga asanas dedicated to a particular goal or part of the body. So if you want to focus on core strength, the dvd may give you a 10-20 minute segment you can play with asanas focusing on devleoping core strength. This dvd does this well and allows you to ""play all"" if you desire it. The only drawback is what if I want to focus on core strenth and flexibility in one session? I have to stop and manipulate the menu to go to flexibility after I'm done with the core strength session. Other DVDs already have this figured out by providing a ""matrix"" that allows you to set up your goal forthe day. Otherwise this DVD is very good but I still prefer Yee's Total Body DVD.",1288224000,7,793,4.401360544217687
4124429,5,B003H8F3A4,I enjoy doing yoga at home and have DVD's from numerous instructors.  Many are quite excellent but Rodney Yee has always been my favorite of all of them.  I have several of his DVD's.  This new DVD is now a new all-time favorite!  I love that you can choose any of the workouts or all of them if you wish.  He is such a calming presence with great music and amazing backdrops. I hope Rodney keeps making wonderful yoga DVD's.  I also prefer him instructing on his own without anyone else.
