This tape has wonderful action and great music, including the song by Toby Keith, ""Should have been a cowboy."" Still, don't feel you must be a cowboy to love this. I don't feel that way whenever seeing this. But any action fan would be greatly moved by this entertaining program. Your cowboy friends might like it a lot too. Buy this tape!!!",1268956800,,460,4.238636363636363
