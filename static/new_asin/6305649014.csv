7896076,3,6305649014,"Wanted is a likely made to go straight to TV movie made in 2000. It's your standard cool but troubled guy gets himself into trouble with people who want to do harm so hides out in a conservative place and by simply being there lifts the self esteem and changes the attitude of those there to be themselves, which therefore makes them better at their jobs. In Wanted that guy is a young greaser black leather jacket wearing type who is part of the underworld of some large city, he decides to ride his motorbike and tale a car with the underworld boss in it since the guy fobbed him off and didn't have time to talk to him. Spying on him he notices the boss is being held at gunpoint by the guy who turned the tables on him that he was meeting in an abandoned warehouse so tries to save the day by drawing his own weapon but this goes horribly wrong with him fatally shooting the boss. He must now flee or be hunted down by the boss' son and rest of the mob. For some reason he stops in the middle of nowhere and two young kids try and steal his car, when they flee from him one is bitten by a rattlesnake and since none of them know where the hospital is he drives the kid to their religious boarding school which the kids had been running away from. Simply by honking his horn as he drives up makes the school nurse run out and the kid is saved. Afterwards the nurse and priest thank the greaser, the nurse's boyfriend has just told the priest he's not going to paint a classroom wall and driven off. Greaser offers to paint the wall in return for food and board and minimum wage over the next couple of days since this is as good a place as any to hide out. However the nurse's boyfriend for some reason did a u-turn and is watching the outside of the school, he doesn't like the fact greaser is around his woman and shortly after tells greaser to move on. Of course Greaser sees this pathetic guy, laughs at his threats and tells him he's not going anywhere. To add to pathetic guys woes the nurse tells him she doesn't want to be in a relationship with him anymore. Pathetic guy is not going to just walk away from this and plans to have his vengeance on Greaser which he assumes will get his girl back.

These made for TV movies always have a cast of unknowns and an actor from a TV show that was big but ended a decade or so again. Wanted's TV show actor is Tracey Gold from Growing Pains, who plays the school nurse. Of course Growing Pains isn't a show that has been seen much since it went of the air. However fortunately for this movie time has given it a second draw card whose name can prominently be put on the DVD cover to entice you to buy it. The kid who got bitten by the snake was played by Justin Berfield who of course in the same year this film came out would appear on TV screens, in a new show that became huge, which was of course Malcolm in the Middle, where he played Reese. However his character in this one doesn't have a lot of screen time, and is only the younger side kick of the kid with most of the lines and interaction with the greaser character.

Making the main character a greaser type of course very much dates the film, even in 2000 it was probably a cool look that nobody who had moved on from the early 90's ever used anymore. Greaser is played by someone called Michael Sutton, he doesn't do a bad job but if he got typecast as this look you can understand why you've never seen him in anything else. The story doesn't bring anything to the screen you haven't seen in other similar movies such as Sister Act. Wanted does have a twist at the end but that just makes the whole storyline up to that somewhat implausible, and raises more questions when there obviously isn't time to answer them, when the movie should be wrapping up in the viewers' minds. Plus you're wondering the whole time don't schools have to background checks on anyone who they employ, I know it was a religious one and they liked to turn a blind eye to endangering kids back in those times, but even they would surely have had to have done a police check on someone who was going to be around kids.",1451520000,,4112,4.203797468354431

One can make a game out of guessing what the next line will be.  Every character is either a stereotype or archetypical - nothing real here to see.  There's the good guy in a bad situation, the struggle between older and younger priest on acceptance and discipline, the repressed, sexually/emotionally deprived woman returning to the small town after failing in the big city, engaged to the jealous, hotheaded, feeble minded beau from her youth, the unredeemable bad guys, two ""lost boys"" looking for a sense of family - they're all here, and none of them with even the remotest spin of something new.  From the first few minutes you can figure out exactly what will happen by film's end.  The story isn't entirely lame, but direction, acting (even from a cast with some talent) everything is thrown together without skill. As to the storyline, we've all seen it plenty of times before, for instance in ""Sister Act.""

This is also one of those films where inattention to small details show up in an even more glaring light.  (As example: the nurse and our hero drive into town but park several blocks away from their destinations (post office and hardware store) - yet both walk across empty parking lots for no apparent reason.  Or the passage of morning to night during a scene that seemingly should occur in no more than half an hour.  The movie is filled with that kind of stuff and then tags on an improbable denouement.
