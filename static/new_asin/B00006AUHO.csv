7966474,5,B00006AUHO,"My three year old loves Miss Patty Cake and we have several of her videos. This one is great and it teaches my daughter about the needs of others in the world, which helps me to tell her how incredibly blessed we are because God has given us so much! Miss Patty Cake is always happy and vibrant too. She practically oozes God's love and sings great. I enjoy watching these with my daughter. It gets her moving, clapping, and singing. She tells me, ""Come on Mom, let's dance!"" Of course, Miss Patty Cake is annoying to some people, but what do you expect for a video geared towards preschoolers! You have to be overly energetic to keep the little ones engaged!",1223856000,2,659,4.409836065573771
7966475,5,B00006AUHO,"I recommend this video for all children, my son loves watching Miss Patty cake and he even interacts and sings along with her, learning in the same time so much about creation. Miss Patty Cake did a fantastic job!",1168473600,3,213,4.487179487179487
7966476,4,B00006AUHO,"We got this video at an introductory price, and my daughter absolutely loves it. Miss Pattycake's enthuasism (although sincere) kind of grates on my nerves, but the music is wonderful. A few of the songs have hand motions -- a plus with children. Some of the concepts are a little beyond my 2-year-old's understanding (geography, etc.), however the video is educational. Miss Pattycake does a great job with teaching little ones about praising and thanking God. Also, the video is kind of short, but I think worth the small price.",1086048000,5,530,4.9
