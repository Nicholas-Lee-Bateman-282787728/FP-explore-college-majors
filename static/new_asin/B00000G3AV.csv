7908915,5,B00000G3AV,I love Pooh and so does my child. Now we can sing along to songs together. Im satisfied with my purchase.,1365724800,,105,4.0476190476190474
7908916,4,B00000G3AV,"very fun.. good colors, songs and dances... i gave only 4 stars due to so much time wasted at beginning of tape for ads, and previews and commercials.  actual movie is way less time then expected.",1354838400,,196,4.444444444444445
7908917,5,B00000G3AV,"I got this video when my oldest son (now 11) was three months old. It captured his attention right away. The fact that the whole video is made up of songs is what appeals to the little ones. They don't have to try to follow a plot, just sit and be entertained. Through the years, it gave me 25 minutes here and there to get supper going or do whatever while the kids watched. They watched it so often that it wore out, so I had to purchase another copy for baby #4. She's now 2 years old, and still enjoys singing along with Pooh!",1265155200,,530,4.057142857142857
7908918,5,B00000G3AV,Our 16-month child requests this video several times every day.  She requests this video whenever she sees a blank television screen or computer monitor.  She names the characters and dances the kicks with the chorus line at the big finale.  The adult in me wanted better animation and more traditional Pooh songs but the parent in me is just thrilled to see such joy in my daughter's face every time.,1005177600,2,401,4.7
7908919,5,B00000G3AV,"This video is by far my little girls favorite! (and we have lots to choose from) The story line is cute and they have included all the classic Pooh songs along with a couple we had never heard but soon came to love!  Our favorite is ""The Kangaroo Hop"" my daughter loves to bounce and sing along!  And even I catch myself singing the tunes long after we've played the tape!  One of those rare videos that you never get tired of! It's a keeper!!!",1004572800,,444,4.2
7908920,5,B00000G3AV,"Terrific. Well produced. Great music and dancing. Characters have distinct personalities, and they represent a wide variety of people. Most personalities are represented from wise to fun to obnoxious. Yet, they are always respectful and helpful. All children laughed and sang along. Kids really love Tigger. He's happy and easy to relate to. They liked the Kangaroo Hop and danced along. ""It teaches kids about sharing."" ""I liked when Pooh found his song."" One two-year-old watched it every day for two weeks. Ages 2-5.",1000252800,,519,5.190476190476191
7908921,5,B00000G3AV,"This Pooh Video Sing Along is perfect for entertaining kids.  My 2 year old daughter loves this and never gets tired singing to ""The Kangaroo Hop"", ""Winnie the Pooh"", etc.  The tunes are catchy and danceable.  In  fact, my daughter sings AND dances to the music!
My personal favorite is ""The Wonderful Thing About Tiggers"", fast and lively! I've almost memorized this song.
Recommended for kids 2 to 92!",971654400,7,403,4.797101449275362
7908922,5,B00000G3AV,"I purchased this video for my 20 month old son. He is in love with it. He would like to spend his every waking hour watching ""pooh"". We have purchased some of the other Winnie the Pooh series videos, but he  won't even sit through 3 minutes of them and cries until we put the Sing A  Song with Pooh video in. I'v logged on here now to purchase a new copy, my  sons love for the video has lasted longer than the tape could. Great Job  Disney!",936748800,4,441,3.977272727272727
