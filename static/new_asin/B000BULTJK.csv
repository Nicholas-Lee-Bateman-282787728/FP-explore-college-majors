8092957,5,B000BULTJK,"This is a great introduction to the band 3 Doors Down, as told by the band's founding members themselves, from their hometown of Escatawpa, Mississippi. Escatawpa is in the southeastern part of Mississippi, near the town of Pascagoula, Miss. & Mobile, Alabama. I used to live in Mobile, and I pasted through their home town area many times. It's very rural & country. One of the members mentions that Escatawpa has one post office about 50 churches, and ""One Red Light"". The band was formed in 1996. The genres they perform include: Hard Rock, Alternative Rock, Post Grunge, & Southern Rock.

The 4 founding members (from 1996) & current members in this dvd are:
Brad Arnold - currently lead vocals, & formerly played the drums also.
Matt Roberts - currently guitar player
Todd Harrell - currently bass guitar player
Chris Henderson - currently guitar

Later around 2005 they added the following member:
Greg Upchurch - drums
Note: He is not in this dvd.

It shows the original 4 members in boats traveling up & down the Escatawpa, River, and area bayous, and talking about gator hunting. They spent a lot of their time on the river, while growing up. And now, they enjoy spending time there, when they are back home from touring. The members grew up together as friends, and attended high school at Moss Point High. This dvd show lots of great home video footage of the members.

This band has had at least 6 #1 hits, including ""Kryptonite"", ""Loser"", ""when I'm gone"", and ""Here Without You"".

Also, included in this dvd are scenes of them performing on the U.S.S.George Washington, in the Persian Gulf. They are very patriotic, and very supportive of our troops.

Finally, the dvd includes the music videos of:
Kriptonite
Be Like That
When I'm gone
Away From the Sun
Loser.

If you like this band, you'll love this dvd. If you're not familiar with this band or don't know much about them, then this dvd is a great introduction to them.

To add a personal note, I'd like to mention that 3 Doors Down was the 1st band to perform at the Grand Opening of the Hard Rock Casino, in Biloxi, Mississippi, back on July 7, 2007, (7/7/7). Thanks!!!",1294099200,3,2138,4.667553191489362
