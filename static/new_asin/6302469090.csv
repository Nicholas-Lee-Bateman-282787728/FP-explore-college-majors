The audio is much slower than normal, it almost sounds satanic.  I searched everywhere and you can get the master collection set soon with  Fists, Game, and Return of the dragon.

476731,5,6302469090,"Although ""Enter the Dragon"" remains the most popular of Bruce Lee's films, ""The Chinese Connection"" is, by far, my personal favorite.  The film showcases not only Lee's remarkable versatility, grace,  and power as a martial artist, but his formidable acting skills, as well.  The fight scenes, as expected, are unforgettable (especially the two  nunchaku scenes), but Lee's inimitable intensity, charisma, and charm make the rest of the film equally enjoyable.  If you want to understand why Lee is a legend, ""The Chinese Connection"" is the perfect place to start your Bruce Lee education.",925689600,2,589,5.290322580645161

His second and final collaboration with Chinese Director of some little note, Lo Wei.  This is the movie that highlighted to the west the antipathy between China & Japan;  it contain the most vivid & emotive fight sequences; introduced the nunchuku to the western world; and made Bruce Lee an international star.  This kind of choreographed fighting (Kung Fu) had never or rarely been witnessed by the general public before & was a stunning & astonishing visual treat.  Surprisingly it had a great music score and although largely confined to sets still gave off the tantalizing flavour of the east.

The picture is AMAZING and Shout Factory corrected the muddy cyan transfer from their previous BD release! Words can't describe how AWESOME this picture looks!

The audio, still great and many choices to select, is the same from Shout's previous BD release. You have too many tracks to choose from. Bonus material is fine and included.

My only complaint is why Shout released the American title of ""The Chinese Connection"" whereas it should be the original title of ""Fist of Fury"", BUT Shout, being awesome as they are, have a reversible BD case cover, which has the original movie poster for ""Fist of Fury."" I flipped my cover!

The plot, like ETD, is very basic. Bruce comes back to his martial arts school to find out his teacher was dead! Not only that, he suspects was murdered and goes on a rampage to avenge his death!

What's interesting is that even though the film is fiction, the teacher was actually a real life person. That character was recently shown in a film by Jet Li called ""Fearless.""

476943,4,6302469090,"1972's ""The Chinese Connection"" features a young Bruce Lee as the leading student at a King Fu Academy in 1908 Shanghai.  The storyline is a simple tale of revenge, but in the context of a Shanghai dominated by Japanese and other outsiders, in which the natives are treated as second-class citizens, it resonated deeply with its original Chinese audience.

In the movie, Chen, played by Bruce Lee, returns to his academy to find that his beloved master, a famous martial artist, is dead.  Chen is stricken with grief, but learns from his fellow students that his master's death may not have been an accident.  Chen patiently but violently works his way back through the members of a rival Japanese school, looking for those responsible for the master's death.  Highlights include a many-on-one fight at the school, which Chen wins decisively, and a confrontation with a Russian martial artist brought in to deal with Chen.  Chen's willingness to stand up for his fellow Chinese forces the hand of the local authorities (including a police chief played by director Lo Wei), who are beholden to the Japanese.  Cornered at the end, the gallant Chen will be left with only one option.

The original Chinese is dubbed over in English, unfortunately resulting in dialogue that sounds like it was lifted from a high school drama.  Fortunately, the non-verbal qualities of the acting, including a touching performance by Nora Miao as Chen's love interest and some nicely choreographed fight sequences, carry the movie.  ""Chinese Connection"" is a Raymond Chow production, and a better than average representative of the early martial arts genre.

This movie is highly recommended to fans of Bruce Lee and of the early martial arts movies.",1190592000,,1729,5.031578947368421

Make no mistake about it because that's where the similarities end as ""The Chinese Connection"" is a far superior production in comparison to Lee's first film (originally titled ""The Big Boss"").  In ""The Chinese Connection"" Lee plays Chen Zhen a fictional student to real life martial arts hero Huo Yuanjia who was poisoned by Japanese in Shanghai during the 1930's.  Using this basic premise the film follows the super human exploits of Chen Zhen who seeks revenge for the murder of his beloved teacher.

""The Chinese Connection"" in many ways is the best of Lee's five films.  It is the film that really established him as a martial arts superstar but it is also the film that set him up as an icon in representing equality between the Chinese and Japanese people.  In undoubtedly one of the seminal events in Hong Kong cinema Lee proclaims ""we (Chinese) are not sick men (of Asia)."" This comment is made in reference to a sign that was given to Chen Zhen's school by some Japanese martial artists as a challenge to fight. After this declaration Lee's character proceeds to force his Japanese discriminators to literally eat their words making them ingest that sign with the offensive message. This scene was perhaps the first time on film that a actor of Chinese decent proclaimed an equal standing with the Japanese and certainly was not lost with his adoring countrymen.

After gaining a great deal of clout with the success of his first film Lee was able to demand more creative control with ""The Chinese Connection"" and he put this power to good use.  While Lo Wei receives an on screen credit for directing, it is Lee who is responsible for the direction of all of the fight scenes that he participated in.  In this role Lee introduces some groundbreaking techniques as it relates to camera angles and shot selection.  The centerpiece of this innovation takes place in a scene shot in a Japanese Dojo where Lee is surrounded by angry students. As the action commences Lee kicks nine of them without pause or edit in spectacular fashion rendering them helpless.  The scene is shot overhead which was a technique rarely used in Hong Kong films of this period but it gave a drama and tension that is palpable even after 30 years.

Lee's fighting style is direct and precise. There is no wasted movement in his approach to neutralizing an attack.  It is this economical approach to martial arts (honest expression of self) that has allowed Lee to remain relevant even in today's martial arts world that is heavily reliant on wires and special effects.  He is unequaled in every match up but brings so much intensity to his performance that it is impossible to take your eyes off of him even though there is little doubt as to how each encounter will end.  Watching ""The Chinese Connection"" is bitter sweet because while you can still marvel at Lee's unquestioned brilliance there is a sense of what might have been had he not died so tragically at the age of 32.",1130976000,2,3254,4.704225352112676

476975,4,6302469090,"Bruce Lee's second blockbuster kung fu film ""Jing wu men"" (1972), is arguably his best movie and captures Lee at his most lethal, charismatic and heroic. Set in turn of the century Shanghai, Bruce Lee is the Chinese kung fu school's most promising student (Chen), and he returns home to find his Sifu (or Master) has died. A very upset Bruce refuses to accept his teacher's death, and his suspicions are further aroused by a hostile visit by members of the local Japanese Bushido school bearing a banner insinuating that the Chinese are the ""sick men of asia"".

Suffice to say, that getting on the wrong side of Bruce Lee is like sticking your hand into a hornets nest, and Bruce is shortly dishing out retribution against the bullying Japanese with his stinging fists and spinning kicks. Produced on a rather modest budget by Golden Harvest Productions, ""Fist Of Fury"" relies on a relatively simple plot line, however Lee demonstrates during the movie his acting depth and that he is equally capable of playing a lethal avenger, a broken hearted pupil and even a grinning, buffoonish telephone repairman. The film was also the first time Bruce showed off his prowess with a pair of nunchuka.....how many people after seeing this film ran out and bought a pair of nunchuka, and then proceeded to clobber themselves black and blue trying to imitate Lee's whirling technique ?

When ""The Chinese Connection"" aka ""Fist Of Fury"" was released in Hong Kong in 1972, it had an even greater box office impact than Lee's first kung fu spectacular ""The Big Boss"". Once again, Chinese film fans flocked in their thousands to see this handsome, virile and athletic Chinese actor who wasn't afraid to say he was proud to be Chinese, but more than that, he throttled his Japanese adversaries and made them respect him and his Chinese kung fu. And when Bruce goes strolling into a park and is denied entrance due to a sign saying ""No Dogs or Chinese Allowed"", he vents his anger on mocking Japanese students, and then splinters the sign with a leaping front kick. It's interesting to note that Bruce Lee had a similar effect on Chinese audiences, in much the same way that ""blaxploitation"" films of the same period hit the right note with African American audiences. Jim Brown, Fred Williamson and Bernie Casey were very similar to Bruce Lee....good looking, hard hitting tough guys who didn't take insults lying down, and they took a stand and fought back. No wonder highly popular kung fu and blaxploitation films often turned up on double bills across the USA in the mid 1970's !

There is also an interesting story regarding the USA release title/s of Bruce's first two kung fu films. After the huge success in 1973 of ""Enter The Dragon"" in the USA, National General released Bruce Lee's three prior kung fu films, but there was a mix up in the titles. Bruce's first big success was ""Tang shan da xiong"" (1971), about an ice factory being used for heroin smuggling, and with the success of the Gene Hackman film ""The French Connection"", it was decided to release Bruce Lee's film about crooked drug dealers in the USA as ""The Chinese Connection"". However, somehow the prints of ""Tang shan da xiong"" and ""Jing wu men"" were mis-labeled, and ""Jing wu men"" was mistakenly released in the USA as ""The Chinese Connection"", and ""Tang shan da xiong"" was released as ""Fists of Fury"".

( I agree...it's very confusing ! )

The DVD on Amazon with the red tinted cover is unfortunately the Region 1 CBS/FOX non-widescreen version, dubbed with English voices and only presented in Dolby Digital 2.0 mono.

HOWEVER....over many many years, I've purchased and owned numerous versions of ""The Chinese Connection"" aka"" Fist Of Fury"" on VHS, LD and DVD....thus I think I've come across the finest example of them all. Media Asia / Hong Kong Legends have released a Special Collectors Edition DVD that is just jammed full of fantastic features. First off, it's a digitally remastered razor sharp print in 2.35:1 Anamorphic Widescreen, secondly the soundtrack is presented in Dolby Digital 5.1 Audio for BOTH the dubbed English language version, plus it includes the original Cantonese soundtrack. WOW....those kicks and punches now reverberate through my surround sound system with real cracks and thuds. ( Most other versions are either mono only, or Dolby Digital 2.0 mono ! )

There's also a wonderful audio commentary by martial arts practitioner and cinema guru, Bey Logan, which is both informative and entertaining, an animated biography showcase, the HK & UK theatrical trailers, and four photo galleries. Plus to cap it all off, there are recent interviews with two of Bruce Lee' s co-stars from ""The Chinese Connection"" aka ""Fist of Fury"", Tony Liu and Max Lee. To the best of my knowledge, the Media Asia / Hong Kong Legends version is only available in Region 2 and Region 4 DVD, however that's no issue if you have a multi zone DVD player. So, if you want to see Bruce Lee's finest film, in its best presentation to date, then definitely hunt down the Media Asia / Hong Kong Legends DVD release...it's readily available on the Amazon UK website.

The English dubbing is immediately off-putting and most of the acting is just so-so, but never have I seen Bruce Lee act with such intensity in his fight scenes.  His acting is the best by far, especially when he is on the run and acting in disguise, such as the goofy telephone repairman.  As in most of Lee's films, there's also some female ""skin"" scenes thrown in, which is never a bad thing.  But watch this movie and take note of the super-intensity Lee exhibits in the fight scenes, which may indeed have its roots in Chinese-Japanese racism (a reality, but fading with new generations.)",1103414400,3,768,4.503597122302159

The acting consists of expressions of incredulity, sneers, grimaces and befuddlement all delivered with intense ineptitude by all of the cast.

The plot only works if you ignore what you're seeing.  Of course most people prefer to live this way so I suspect that's part of this movie's appeal.

Consider:  Bruce Lee's character arrives at his master's funeral in such a crazed state he's only prevented from digging the man up by being whacked over the head with a shovel.  Next he starts a fight with a rival school which has the political clout needed to close his master's school down.  Later, when he discovers the people who killed his master he murders them, thus eliminating any chance of getting his school out of trouble.  Lee's association with his master's school is so disasterous that by the end of the film the school is wrecked and many of his classmates are dead.

There's also a nasty taint of racism that can't be ignored.  The villians are Japanese and they're brutal, lavicious and criminal.  To help us determine which orientals are the bad ones most of the Japanese sport bad Elvis haircuts and sideburns.  One even wears thick, round spectacles once the trademark of every Japanese villian.  The chief Japanese villian has a mustashe of such preposterous dimensions it almost begs to be twirled.

The fight scenes are fun, though utterly unbelievable. After many years of martial arts training and sparring I cringe at the idea of Lee's carefully choregraphic dances being considered ""fights.""  Bruce Lee spends far too much time holding poses so we can see his muscles while his opponents politely wait for someone to step forward to be the next one to get kicked in the face.

476986,4,6302469090,"Reviewing Bruce Lee films is not easy. On one hand, you have a legend of martial arts who is a good actor. On the other hand, you have terrible scripts, horrid supporting acting, TERRIBLE voice dubbing, and just odd little tidbits that hurt the film. If you go into these movies with the right frame of mind, I think everyone can enjoy them. I can see how some people can be turned off by them, however. I mean it's not like Bruce can fight all 100 min.
Like his first film (Fists Of Fury), this movie is basically about revenge. Bruce comes back to his martial arts school to find his teacher has been killed and a rival Japanese school is responsible. His school prides itself on avoiding conflict as much as possible and only fights when it has to. He, on the other hand, wants to avenge the death of his teacher and teach the bad guys a lesson.
Like I said before, the acting is pretty much terrible with a couple exceptions. Bruce and his leading lady have some nice, romantic parts that are watchable. But, like his other Hong Kong films, it's all just there to give Bruce an excuse to kick some ass. And that he does very well.
One of his most famous on-screen fight scenes takes place in this movie. He literally takes a whole Japanese kung-fu school on by himself. And wins. He also fights a sword-wielding bad guy with just his hands and feet. He fights a huge russian (His name is actually Robert Baker and was one of Bruce's students at the time) that can bend steel pipes with his bare hands. I think you get the idea. The fight scenes are better in this movie than they were in Fists Of Fury. This is the one that amazed people and really started the Bruce Lee phenomenon. Highly recommended for any martial arts fan and essential for any Bruce Lee freak, like myself.

477008,5,6302469090,"The Chinese Connection may well be Bruce Lee's best film.  It certainly showcases the full range of his acting and martial arts skills.  His character displays a number of intense emotions as this story unfolds, but most importantly Bruce Lee gives us a number of impressive fight scenes.  Lee's performance here is perhaps most memorable, though, for the disguises that Lee's character adopts in the second half of the film.  His appearance as an old man selling newspapers is impressive, but who can ever forget his portrayal of a goofy, bespectacled telephone repairman?  There are just all kinds of great and quite memorable aspects to this film.
The story takes place in Shanghai around the beginning of the twentieth century, with plenty of tension to go around between the occupying Japanese authorities and the Chinese citizens.  As the film opens, we learn that the venerated ""Teacher"" of a Chinese martial arts school has been poisoned.  Chen Zhen (Bruce Lee) arrives just in time to see Teacher's body laid to rest, and this throws Chen into such an emotional maelstrom of grief that he jumps onto the coffin and struggles to bring Teacher back.  At the memorial service, a delegation of folks from the local Japanese martial arts school come to disrespect Teacher, his students, the school, and China in general.  Chen, out of respect for Teacher, manages to hold himself back from giving these guys the beating they deserve, but he soon decides to make his way to the Japanese school and prove just how wrong their charges of cowardice were.  A series of increasingly violent reprisals then takes place between the two schools.  While Chen works to personally avenge the death of Teacher, the Japanese demand his arrest and threaten to shut down the Chinese school.  With both parties resorting to increasingly extreme measures, no one comes out of this conflict unscathed.
The Chinese Connection really starts out like gangbusters.  The emotional drama is intense from the very beginning, and it is quickly followed by two impressive panoramic fight scenes.  The scene wherein Chen takes on the whole Japanese school single-handed is just incredible; Bruce breaks out the numchuks for this one, and he really puts on a show with them.  The big fight between the students of both schools isn't quite as impressive, lacking Bruce's presence, but there's still something exhilarating about watching dozens of men and women going at it tooth and nail.  Aside from a few murders, the martial arts action takes a backseat during the middle parts of the film, but of course no Bruce Lee movie can end without a conclusive fight between the big boys.  Chen has to take on not only the Japanese ace but Russia's most capable martial artist as well.  At times, decisive moments in the fights are shown in slow motion, which works effectively to make the action even more impressive.  At one point toward the end, we see the classic shot of Lee's hands moving so quickly that he appears to have sprouted the extra appendages of a Buddhist icon.
As is the case with Fists of Fury, the conclusion of this film is not the stuff fairy tales are made of.  Many tragic events take place in the latter half of the film, and the whole thing ends on a rather sad note, yet the conclusion strikes me as both noble and just.  If you've never seen a Bruce Lee movie, I really think The Chinese Connection is the best place to start.  The movie grabs you by the throat at the very beginning, showcases Lee's incredible talents for both martial arts and fight choreography early on, and sustains your abiding interest until the story ends.",1064966400,,3628,4.827140549273021

Fist of Fury (The Chinese Connection US title) is the best Bruce Lee action movie because it is virtually non-stop action but is one of his early works and so looks a little aged but this certainly does not distract from some of the most awesome martial arts ever committed to celluloid.
The plot in this early Lee movie is actually coherent and is based on an old Chinese story about a martial arts student who avenges his masters murder by poisoning during the Japanese occupation of China. Cue various set pieces involving a furious Bruce Lee who sets out to do away with anything that stands in his way... and he does. Fight scenes involve Bruce Lee tearing apart two Samurai training schools - with a great nunchaku fight scene, a massive sixty-plus martial artists battle sequence inside another school (you have to see that! - they are fights going on everywhere!) and the end showdown with a Russian fighter and Japanese warlord which has some fantastic technique switching from Bruce Lee and by far the best kick and follow up punch move you will likely ever see anywhere again.
Even though Bruce Lee is not anywhere near his peak with his technique this is the Lee movie that you should be seeing in order to understand why America wanted this guy for future films like Way of the Dragon (Return of the Dragon US title) or Enter the Dragon. You will also love the animal sounds he makes to distract his opponents (chickens of all things!).

477012,5,6302469090,"This is one of Bruce Lee's best films.  His somewhat darkened film Fist of Fury was pretty good too. Interestingly people who talk about his skills truly don't understand his skills.  I'm not sure he was the best but he was a pretty amazing martial artist and a rather charismatic actor.  I beleive his style(s) would be different today because he was an ever changing person in his philosphy and improvement of skills.  People who know anything about fighting know what I am talking about.  There were elements of jui-jitsu where Bruce almost gets armbarred on the floor and bites the guy to break the hold or else his arm is broken.  His actualy fighting look quite different than what he does on screen but there are aspects of what he does for real that is on screen.  You can see him put it altogther going from fighting stlye to fighting style and that was his true point was to adapt to the situation.  He was showing that there were no rules to fighting from eye gouge to biting (your standard street fight/dirty fighting showing that a street fighter has a right type of thinking in a fight and uses everything as a weapon), wing-chun (very strong at in close fighting and speed plus reflexes), to jui-jitsu (on the ground fighting), to American boxing (where he jabs the Russian in the face about 5 times without a single response from his opponent, he even jukes the fakes so nicely you wonder where he comes up with the stuff.  He usually enters with a kick if you notice and then pops the guy (Russian again) with a mean 7 hit combo of punches to the body and face.  But he shows that you don't stop smashing the guy even when he's out of range of a punch and finishes with a kick.  Then he switches it up and jukes with a rushing lead right up high and nails the very confused Russian with a side kick to the body.  Everytime the Russian comes in he pops him with something be it a kick (usually a side kick because it has the longest range for your various attacks, front kick has a long range but it's more of a push kick then a bludgeoning type kick like a side kick)or jab or hook.  If you analyze it like this you begin to see what he is saying not with words but with what he's showing you with action and the audience has missed this.  And what he's trying to say is that be creative and don't fall into a style but use the styles strengths and mix it up when you do fight.
As for the story, there is one other movie that did a remake off of this one.  It was done by the now famous Jet Li, called the Fist of Legend.  The story is exactly the same and the actor names are completely the same.  The only true difference in the films were action.  Jet uses a much flashier action style and it is rather intense.  The only difference is that Jet interestingly enough takes a completely different fight style which encompasses more kung fu philosophy than anything.
Really it sets in a time period where Japanese took over China during World War 2 I beleive.  Where the Japs dominated some regions of China.  The tale takes place where there existed a legend.  Neither movie Connection or Jet Li's Fist of Legend explain the plot terrible well as is because it's an action film anyhow.  But the Legend Hero Chan-Zen comes back because he hears of his masters death.  Right off the bat the Japanese hate the Chinese by proving that they are better at everything including Kung-fu, except there is a problem Chan (Bruce Lee) is back and whips the Japs like he was just warming up.  Then it escalates bigger problems by the Japs taking revenge and plotting to rid of the school because they fear Chan and noone comes close to having the skills to beat him.  This leads to many deaths due to Chan's emotion running wild and kills some Japanese and of course they want revenge by putting him in jail or execution because they cant take care of him through martial arts.  Of course Chan finds out that the Japs actually plotted against Chan's master and poisoned him to death and made him weak for the fight and died during a combat fight using kung fu and of course lost to a Japanese fighter.  Chan goes crazy and starts mauling everyone in his way which leads to a surprise ending or different ending.
I loved this film and of course his many others.  It's too bad when he started gaining fame and the love of the people with his brilliant on screen charisma that he then died so soon.",1059004800,,4400,4.357843137254902

477015,5,6302469090,"I grew up watching Bruce Lee movies, and this one has my favorite fighting scene: Bruce Lee's first battle with the entire Japanese martial arts school.  Although this is by no means the most intense fight scene, it is impressive because it shows Bruce Lee taking on about 20 guys at the same time.  This is much more realistic than many other martial arts movies because they do not attack him one by one after surrounding him (which has become the standard for most martial arts movies); I know from my own experience that if one is surrounded by more than one opponent, they will definitely not attack him or her one by one.  The dub job is horrible, but it is extremely entertaining; I could not stop laughing at it!  It is highly unlikely that an entire male cast would have speaking voices similar to that of John Wayne.  The story itself is somewhat touching, since it deals with the Japanese imperialism and prejudice towards the Chinese; however, it is the campy elements as well as the impressive martial arts action that make this an instant classic.

If you stick with the Fox (20th Century) version , you can't lose. Once again , this version comes off as a cheap bootleg copy without any extras (commentary ect.).

This movie , in particular , has the famous back yard brawl (hint's of Muhammad Ali's boxing influence on Mr. Lee are prvalent , here), and the dojo fight scene (with the num-chuck's). Plus , you get to see Bruce go undercover , as a nerd and an ending that is very special, because it never happens in any other Bruce Lee movie. His ""Hollywood"" charisma and intense acting skills have improved tremendously from his previous roles, and his presence is as hallucinating and electric ,as ever. Based on the fact that it is a great, Bruce Lee film , is the only reason I gave it three stars.

477040,3,6302469090,"By the early 1970's, Bruce Lee had become a major martial arts star in Hong Kong.  One of his early films, FISTS OF FURY, showcased Lee's considerable fighting skills which unfortunately were overshadowed by his equally considerable lack of both experience and persona.  With his next film, THE CHINESE CONNECTION, Lee has clearly made considerable progress on his learning curve to be a major star in cultures other than his own. There is much to praise in TCC.  Lee plays Chen, a young disciple of his martial arts instructor, whom he identifies by the simple honorific of Teacher. Lee returns from a journey only to discover that Teacher has died from some unspecified cause, which he is sure is a result of foul play from a rival Japanese martial arts school.  The bulk of the plot is dedicated to a continuous collective battle between Lee and the many representatives of the Japanese school.
  In TCC, actor Lee and fight choreographer Lee learned well that he is the reason why people bought tickets to see a movie that by the standards of the time was considerably inferior even to Hollywood's worst efforts. Lee is onscreen in nearly every scene.  Director Lo Wei wisely allowed Lee to show other aspects to his personality other than those that connect to fighting.  Lee shares several tender scenes with his girlfiend, who, even through the still atrocious dubbing, manages to convince the viewer that her affection for him is real. Lee even projects several stark scenes of Brando-esque emoting of a range from grief over Teacher's death to sullen acceptance of personal responsibility for the deaths of his schoolmates. But it was not the introspective Kwai Chang Caine Lee that Hong Kong fans bulled their way into the packed movie houses.  It was the athletic, spinning reverse kicks, nunchaku driven Bruce Lee that they came to see.  And Lee did not disappoint.  Most of the fights of interest relate to one of two sorts: the one-on-many scenes in which the bad guys form a circle and get punched and kicked out in turn and the far more interesting one-on-one confrontations between Lee and a highly skilled opponent.  Lee has a battle with a Russian boxer, Petrov, who is no pushover.  Petrov actually lands a number of his own blows which knock Lee to the ground before he himself is flattened.  One of the major differences between the earlier FISTS OF FURY and THE CHINESE CONNECTION lie within the evolving persona of Bruce Lee, who played essentially the same character in both.  In the former movie, Lee fights but killing his opponent is a means to an end.  In TCC, killing becomes the sadistic end.  Lee punctuates this unnerving change in his psychological (de?)evolving, by his habit of killing then stringing up his beaten foes as stern reminders to his Japanese competitors that this Bruce Lee is no subservient Charley Chan type.  Lee ends TCC in a blaze of glory as he presumably dies charging single-handedly into the combined rifle fire of his enemies.
  Watching Lee act in both FOF, TCC, and the later ENTER THE DRAGON allows the viewer to trace the gradual evolution of a major martial arts superstar.  In them, we see pretty much the same man at different parts of his life.  Lee seems to say in all his movies that life is a constant flux, and that viewers who see Lee as a fixed icon tacked like an unchanging star in the sky have missed the point that Lee, with all his power, his charm, his skills, is essentially like all of us.",1024963200,2,3470,4.729235880398671

477043,5,6302469090,"Well, I'll be one of many to say it...the sound for this version of Bruce's timeless classic truly [stinks]!! Wow, Fox sure does not know how to remaster a great film. Anyways, the original name for this film is Fist of Fury (not Fists of Fury, which is the replacement name for The Big Boss). Now that the confusion is out of the way hopefully, this is about Chen (Bruce) who comes back to his martial arts school to find his master suspiciously dead. Japanese own the territory, and Chen suspects a murder. He finds out that a Japanese official was behind it, and fights his way to confront him. Thin plot, but the fighting was way ahead of its time. This is the beginning of what everyone remembers of Bruce. His amazing technique and the power that he puts in all of his attacks are mindblowing. Hands down, he is the best realistic fighter to be caught on film. What version to get?? Definitely not this one for the sound is completely mono and only an English dub is available. If you can play Region 2 PAL dvds, then the Hong Kong Legends version entitled Fist of Fury is the one to own. Awesome remastered sound (5.1 dbd Chinese and English) and video (shockingly clear) and uncut. There is also a DTS version which is pretty hard to find, but plays on any dvd player. I can't say much for this one, but DTS for an early 70's film can't be too much better than dbd 5.1. There is also a standard HK version of this film as well, which is still way better than this Chinese Connection release. Just look for the film titled Fist(not Fists) of Fury and you got yourself a classic. This film is such a classic that Jet Li did the infamous remake of it called Fist of Legend, which is probably my favorite martial arts movie of all time. This film is essential for any martial arts collection, and I urge all of you to own it. Actually, all of Bruce's films are a must own...Big Boss (Fists of Fury here in US), Way of the Dragon (Return of the Dragon here), Enter the Dragon, and Game of Death...Way of the Dragon (or Return) was my favorite, check out my review on that and check my other HK reviews too...Hope this was helpful.",1017878400,9,2133,4.335

477078,1,6302469090,"Now any bruce lee fan will tell you that this film is actually called fists of fury, the title ""the Chinese Connection"" was actually meant for the film ""the Big Boss"" (called by the company who did the american DVD ""fists of Fury"") as it had drug references and was around the time of ""French Connection"". But the titles were accidently swapped before the theatrical release.  This was all later fixed and the appropriate titles were given to the appropriate films when they were released on VHS in the 80's, this is also reflected in the far superior, dual language (and on occation Dual DVD) UK versions of Bruce Lee's films, which were done with much consideration to Bruce Lee fans and included plenty of extra's to go through.
I bought ""the Chinese Connection"" (fists of Fury) on DVD in Sydney expecting that the title was the only problem with the DVD. Soon after watching 15mins of the film and searching everywhere for something other than the play and chapter selection options i took the DVD back and exchanged it for a Bruce Lee documentory.
When i got home i went here to amazon to see what the international versions were like, after finding out that what i had bought was exactly the same as what the american public had to put up with i searched the UK site and found highly polished versions of all Bruce Lee's movies on DVD, i have already order 4 of them.
Anyone who considers themselves bruce lee fans should ignore these disgustingly lazy 10th rate DVD's, as they do nothing more than insult Bruce Lee, it is clear that the company in the U.S producing these versions is interested in nothing more than churning out these DVD's as fast as possible to make a quick buck.

Rightfully so, for this is Lee's best movie.  He plays Chen, the top disciple of a revered kung fu master, recently killed under mysterious circumstances.  Chen's spirit burns with a sense of duty, a desire for vengeance and an indomitable will to uphold the pride and rights of his people in a time where they are treated as second class citizens in their own land.  Lee truly showcases his talent as an actor by bringing his character to life with such a wide range of emotion and depth.  It totally overshadows his role in Enter the Dragon, where his character is little more than a subdued killer who gets to spout a few lines of philosophy.  As for the fight sequences, Lee's characteristic fury is never as intense as it is here.  This is also the first time Lee breaks out his infamous nunchakus.  The storyline is somewhat simplistic (as is characteristic with all films of the genre) but it is still extremely heartfelt and symbolic if you understand the feelings  and sentiments of Chinese people at the time.  But even if you don't, the raw power of Bruce's performance along with the gritty, unorthodox fighting should win over any fan of the genre.  In character and creativity, the only other Lee film that could match this one is Return of the Dragon.

It was released as FIST OF FURY in the United states (notice, no ""s"" on the end of ""FIST"").  That is what this video is.  Don't buy it thinking that you are getting the BIG BOSS.  You're not.  I've also seen the CHINESE CONNECTION confused with RETURN OF THE DRAGON that was originally released as WAY OF THE DRAGON.  Ugh!  Luckily, Return of the Dragon is a standard title now.  Those described above, however, will trick you--even when buying Amazon videos.  Be careful--look for the date of release and read the reviews CAREFULLY!",978048000,5,913,4.339285714285714

It has a pristine widescreen transfer and comes with 5 audio tracks (English, Cantonese, Mandarin and two audio commentaries in English and Cantonese). It also comes with 8 different subtitles.  Plus it has unseen footage from Game of Death and five trailers for all of Bruce films. What's really cool about the trailers are that they are the original HK versions.  This DVD version blows away every other release of this film. This is the only way to buy this movie if you don't want to be disappointed. Also, the soundtrack has been remixed in 5.1 Dolby Digital using the original soundtrack.

When Bruce goes to the  Japanese school to ""return"" the gift brought for his teacher,  that is one of the best scenes ever, plus later he takes on, barehanded,  the same... teacher with a sword.

But it's true, Jackie Chan was a stuntman in this movie and  even doubled for the main bad guy in the part where Bruce did a flying side  kick that sent him out a door!  Well, anyways, onto my review.  This is one  of my most favorite Bruce Lee movies because it's actually based off of a  true story!  It might be offensive to Japanese people though, because the  movie takes place at a time when the Japanese were prejudiced against the  Chinese (note the ""No Dogs or Chinese"" sign that Bruce kicks down  if you watch the movie).  It was an innovative movie to me, because it was  the first Bruce Lee movie that had his famous ""WATTAAHH!"" scream  and the first movie where he used the nunchukus.  It was also the only  movie where he kissed a girl.  Sure, the plot is your typical ""You  killed my master..."" type of plot but it's still a classic, 'cuz at  the end, the hero dies.  I was kinda shocked the first time I saw the  famous scene where Bruce Lee's character, Chen Zhen, does a flying side  kick and gets gunned down by angry Japanese.",965088000,5,1125,4.282296650717703

477157,1,6302469090,"How do I hate this disc? Let me count the ways, starting with The Chinese Connection.
1) The video was horribly pixelated and blurry. It looked as if someone took the videotape version, played it on a television, and used  a video camera to copy the movie. 2) As it was, the print they chose was  covered in scratches and dust. I've seen bootlegged copies of movies that  looked better. In fact, this movie looked better when I saw it broadcast by  my local UHF station before cable TV. 3) If that weren't bad enough, the  sound played at a slower than normal pitch, making everyone sound as though  they'd taken steroids or something.
Now for Fists of Fury. 1) The print  that they used suffered from an annoying red tint which made eveyone and  everything look orange. 2) The video on this side wasn't pixelated like the  Chinese Connection side, but it was just as blurry. 3) The audio was  terrible on this side of the disc too. Though the pitch was correct, the  sound was muffled, making everyone sound as though they were talking  through several layers of gauze.
The disc was completely unwatchable, and  I couldn't wait to get it back into the NetFlix mailing envelope. Bruce Lee  fans worldwide should take up a collection to have the people responsible  for this disc hunted down and brought to justice. For good measure I played  this disc in two different players (my JVC XV-M555 three disc changer, and  my new PowerBook (FireWire) with DVD-ROM) with the same result. As for  features, each side has text on Jeet Kune Do, Lee's style of fighting, on  the production of the movie itself, and a trivia game. On the Chinese  Connection side, however, the trivia game is has two glaring errors. The  second question, about the 20 minutes of original footage of Lee in Game of  Death, is repeated in the third question, but the answer has no relevance  to Game of Death. The fourth question is about Lee being an expert Cha-Cha  dancer. If you give the correct answer and select ""True"", you get  the ""Incorrect"" screen. If you choose the incorrect answer,  ""False"" you get the ""Correct"" screen.",952560000,13,2103,4.631436314363143

I have had the privilage of seeing its  complete version by Rank Video itself a couple of years ago but sadly In  the last few years many videos are the censored versions where the  nunchacku fight scenes and certain other high impact action sequences have  been nicely cut.
What puzzles me more is that the Censors did not care  about the semi nude dance which appears in  the movie but on the fight  scenes. In my opinion rather then releasing the censored versions they  should not release it at all. If they just cut the semi nude scene well its  understandable but then instead very strangely the certain core elements  have been censored.
Which in other words is like insulting the movie  title. It is fist of fury but there is no fury as a result of censorship and  newcomers to Bruce lee will fail to understand the uniqueness of the late  martial arts Master.
But I can say in its uncut version even a non  bruce  lee fan and a non martial arts person will be thrilled to death! at Lee's  speed and potential showing what all the motivated martial arts man can do  and what limits and heights of technical skill and power he can  accomplish. Real skill and not magic tricks.
The chinese connection(aka  fist of fury) is even today clearly outstanding in the martial arts  movies.

This is also the movie that catapulted Lee to superstardom in China. The  scene in front of the park when Lee smashes the board that says ""No  dogs or Chinese allowed"" into pieces with a jump kick made the Chinese  audiences go crazy with enthusiasm.
