8285139,4,B001BXNADE,"This Biography presentation of the Green River Killer Gary Ridgway was very interesting and well done.  It provides an overview of the crimes, the victims, and interviews policemen and prosecutors who worked the case.  The beginning is especially chilling as they show how the first several victims were found in the Green River near Seattle, and the police finally admitted they had a psycho on their hands.

The documentary also explores the background of Ridgway and speculates about why he became a serial killer and how he got away with it for so long. In the end he killed at least 47 young women, but probably quite a few more.  It's also noted that Ridgway was bland looking and didn't do anything out of the ordinary (when not killing).  He was married, had a good job, and kept a predictable schedule.

The documentary does fall a bit short explaining how he managed to kill so frequently and also why he wasn't caught sooner. I've read from other sources that there were several suspects in this case, with Ridgway being one of them. But there was insufficient evidence to tie him to the cases. Overall I recommend the documentary but you'll need to read one of the many books on the GRK to find more in-depth details.",1370304000,2,1229,4.666666666666667
8285140,3,B001BXNADE,"The murders by Gacy, Dahmer, Bundy, and others happened more than one decade ago.  However, watching this documentary reminded me of when this was in the news recently.  Its newness may hit close to home for many.  Ridgway killed more than 40 women, tragically beating the approximate 30 victims of Gacy.
This work does leave me with questions.  On the one hand, the work says the killer had a low IQ, but yet he killed for two decades without being caught.  The work said his co-workers wondered if it were him.  Well, why didn't they go to the police with suspicions?  If he killed prostitutes, did sex workers in Washington State organize to fight the killings or get police to respond more effectively?  The work says modern DNA evidence finally trapped him.  I don't recall the work saying how police had the killer's DNA on file for a match.
There is talk about necrophilia here and sensitive viewers may want to be careful in watching this.  When one victim's father says he forgives him, the killer teared up.  I think many viewers will do the same.
There seem to be similarities with Ridgway and Jack the Ripper as they killed female prostitutes, but the work doesn't seem to connect the two.",1222560000,5,1201,4.644549763033176
