7554402,5,B018TA0TR6,What a great movie. Western with a hint of horror. I really enjoyed it.,1456963200,4,71,4.142857142857143
7554403,1,B018TA0TR6,"What this movie proves is that the person responsible for writing the synopsis did an excellent sales job. They draw you in with a simple but rare Western, dressing up the description. In truth, the movie looks like a college project, clumsy and roughly finished. If there was an editor, they failed. The script does not build a connection to any character and the plot gets duller as the characters are killed off. Long on promise, this movie never delivers and, in fact feels unfinished. Do not watch this if you are jonesing for a Western, do not use your time if you need entertainment with some depth or Rodriguez- type action. Actually, if you are stuck in a Doctor's office and the magazines are all dated five years ago and contain nothing of interest for the average reader, the muzak is driving you up a wall and you need to kill nearly two hours, this would still be boring and feel like a waste of your time. The best thing about this movie is the cover art.",1467763200,3,970,4.455056179775281

7554435,5,B018TA0TR6,"Made with Old School Spaghetti Westerns in mind, this film definitely took me on One Hell Of A Ride like no other movie I have seen!! From the very beginning, Kill Or Be Killed kept the anticipation levels very high and continued doing so through to the very end. From the Truly Authentic ""Look And Feel"" of the Old West, this film really captured what it set out to do and this one is a Must-See for any fan of classic westerns(like myself) who are looking for something with a Very Unusual, Dark and Unexpected Twist, which had me on the edge of my seat not knowing what to expect next...and it also included a nice touch of everything else in the process!! Great Movie---Highly Recommended!!!",1457827200,6,695,4.523809523809524

7554437,1,B018TA0TR6,"This is a terrible movie.  Nonsensical, disjointed, waste of time and money.  I would give it negative stars if I could.  Do yourself a favor and pick a different movie to watch.",1457740800,2,178,4.5
7554438,2,B018TA0TR6,"I can appreciate the homage to spaghetti and old gritty westerns,  but I had to stop watching 15 minutes into it just for the acting.

The dialogue delivery was clumsy to watch, it sure looks the script had something going though.

Where's that refund button?",1457740800,6,259,4.711111111111111
7554439,5,B018TA0TR6,Great movie!!,1457481600,,13,6.0
7554440,2,B018TA0TR6,Mostly boring  not very well directed. Acting was so so.  Plot at first seemed decent then just meanders for the whole middle. It picks up at the end but by then I was struggling to keep interest. A movie that could have been better but I'm sure budget was a concern.,1457481600,4,267,4.215686274509804
7554441,5,B018TA0TR6,Fantastic western with a horror edge. Really a fun ride.,1457481600,2,56,4.7
7554442,4,B018TA0TR6,"Back in Texas, post Civil War, a group of outlaws lead by Claude ""Sweet Tooth"" Barbee (Justin Meeks) spring a gang member and have designs to grab hidden gold in Galveston, about 500 miles away. Upon going there, the gang numbers increase as they leave a trail of blood. The film is about their journey...and then suddenly they realize someone is hunting them.

This was an interesting western using lines like, ""put some space betwixt us."" The opening credits had ""Spaghetti Western"" written all over it, but this was close to grindhouse with all the killing and blood. At times it seemed they were spoofing westerns. It does have some mild humor, and what the heck was that Dutch guy doing?

I wasn't able to figure out the killing until they explained it. One character was named Tom Nixon (Larry Grant Harbin) but as far as I can tell it was not supposed to be real life outlaw Tom Nixon.

The film is a blend of grindhouse and western and not a great film as a single genre, but entertaining if you try not to make it into something it is not. Doesn't require as much genre blending as ""Gallowwalkers"" to enjoy.

The producers claim the film takes place in 1900. ""The Eyes of Texas"" which was performed in this feature, was written in 1903.

Guide: No swearing. Brief sex, brief nudity.  2-3 stars for most people. I enjoyed it a bit more.",1457136000,10,1344,4.510288065843621
8742928,3,B018TA0TR6,"WARNING:  contains spoilers!
well...one hour and 43 minutes sure felt like double that time, as this picture moved in a slow manner where time just stood still, instead of creeping along! LOL...however:  despite what is basically a garage production movie, acting talent wise, and sound wise, actually settles down into a road movie where you are not sure if you are dealing with the supernatural on top of everything else.

The Protagonist, a totally worthless scum of a violent criminal, keeps having these weird dreams of an Indian with fire in his eyes knocking them off one by one. Then , when he awakens, sure enough, another one of  them has bitten the dust. At one point, I almost considered that he himself was the culprit without realizing it, but no, instead, it was two demented young brothers, twins,  of which absolutely no explanation is given as to why they have trailed this band of robbers and of course, no explanation of how they were never sighted and were able to sneak up and kill off a bandit at a time without anyone awakening.

Then there is a persistent lawman who somehow foolishly thinks that he is going to bring these cut throats back to justice, and of course he just becomes another one of the endless bodies popping up, or should I say, down , in this movie.

For whatever any budget restrictions they had, they certainly had a great make up artist as there are many bloody scenes of a nature that even I had to turn my head away from.

The intensity of this movie does ratchet up, despite the mystery, and that is why I gave it 3 stars...I wouldn't blame anyone who bailed out on the first act, but a warning to anyone checking these reviews before watching it:  force yourself to get past the first 30 or 45 minutes and at least you will then see why I didn't give it zero stars.",1521590400,,1815,4.492401215805471

8742932,2,B018TA0TR6,The most wanted men in Texas  are on a ride across five hundred miles of badlands to recover a fortune in hidden loot from their most daring robbery. But Barbee and his crew aren't the only coldblooded killers riding the range. With a large dead or alive cash bounty on their heads they begin a hard journey driven by greed becomes a feverish race to survive. They had to break one guy out of jail to get a map he was holding to find the money. A bunch of nonsense happens and then more nonsense. I am pretty sure I napped a some point....such a bore-fest! The acting wasn't bad and the dialog was forced but it was still not worth the time.,1475712000,,641,4.211382113821138
8742933,1,B018TA0TR6,"It takes a lot of people with a range of skills to make a film. Here not one single one of them was minimally competent. The script is as bad as it gets, the direction is worse and it seems they held auditions only for the worst actors in the known universe. Everyone has some kind of cornball, wrong, totally unconvincing and really annoying accent. Nothing makes any sense at all, from the fake distant thunder sounds to the tinny toy guns, the implausible food they are eating...........there is way too much competition for ""worst movie in the world"" but this turkey is up there.
