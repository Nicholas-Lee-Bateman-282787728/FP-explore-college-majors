8220854,5,B000W0655M,"I have loved this movie since I first saw it in the theater in the 80s.  Two great actors, set (unusually) in Naples, interesting story with a characteristic Neapolitan fascination with death and with life, friendship, romance, family, and fantasy.  There is a nice music score behind it all.  Unfortunately, it is not readily available as a DVD that will play in the US.  I have a VHS copy, and recently watched it as a free offering on Kindle through Amazon Prime.  Perhaps the title, but it has never gotten the attention it deserves.",1423526400,3,537,4.670212765957447
