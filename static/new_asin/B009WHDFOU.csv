5370294,2,B009WHDFOU,"This is definitely not one of those comedies you let the kids watch, unless they're a young adult, then maybe. There is sexual references, drug content and nudity.
It's still as funny as Scary Movie, spoofing some of the latest things around, like Youtube. I found that new and entertaining as these movies usually only poke fun at other films.
I laughed quite a few times, but was grossed out a couple times too. All-in-all it was a typical ""stupid-funny"" movie, if you catch my drift.

5370295,4,B009WHDFOU,"If you are looking for a serious film this is not the film to watch. However, if you are looking to have a great laugh over many of the characters that you have been seeing in many other popular films over the last year or so, this is definitely a movie to watch. I have to say that I have watched movies like this in the past and always get a kick out of watching how the writers and directors put together such a mashup of a movie. You have to be able to take the movie with a grain of salt and know that you cannot take it seriously to truly enjoy it. If you can do this though you will see some of the amazing comedy the that writers have put forward in the movie. Some of the writing is definitely brainless humor, but for me that type of humor is sometimes exactly what I need to just forget about the cares of my day.",1357603200,,824,3.940119760479042
5370296,5,B009WHDFOU,"I have seen and the film is just ridiculous in a good way. Takes potshots at all the serious ""characters"" from a number of films like Tattoo Girl, Lincoln, Dark Knight, the Paranormal movies as well as one of my favorites Donald Trump. Its stupid like most mashups but thats what makes it funny. As long as you don't take it seriously ( its not for film snobs),  its worth the price of admission.",1355616000,4,396,4.351351351351352

I tend to err on the generous side with reviews, and I'm pretty good at suspension of disbelief, but it just wasn't happening with this film.  The attempts at ""adult humor"" were painfully lame; and the comedic perspective was ostensibly meant to be in the same vein as Scary Movie, Airplane, and Police Squad, but without a modicum of anything that could spark a laugh.",1425772800,,439,4.544303797468355

5370307,5,B009WHDFOU,"I loved it, despite few minor mistakes in this comedy-horror movie! ""30 NIGHTS OF PARANORMAL ACTIVITY WITH THE DEVIL INSIDE THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO"" is an nerve-biting, wild but weird ride..... A new family -- consisting of the two first-time new parents, a rebellious Gothic stepdaughter Liz who has fallen in love with her new neighbor (an horny axe-wielding president spoofed from ABRAHAM LINCOLN: VAMPIRE HUNTER) and a young partying baby son Jonah -- who can't seems to stopping filming themselves, ended up with a happy good ending. Although I really wanted to see more of these minor characters, such as the hilariously erratical brothers [Ghost Brothers,  which could be an illegal fake company]. Not me! Idon't really care if you reviews have to be always negative every time we have seen a parody film like this like millions of times before, like how you hated Vampires Suck and Disaster Movie....",1391385600,,916,4.9869281045751634

5370310,2,B009WHDFOU,"Someone was saying they thought this movie was way better than Scary MoVie (5) so I figured I would check it out as Scary Movie 5 I thought had decent bits, but still came off as the worst in the series. This one here had such potential with the very opening scene of a skittles parody. I had seen that on Youtube before, but I thought if that is the opening scene, what's to follow will be awesome. Unfortunately, it wasn't. After about the first 30 minutes, the funnier stuff just started going down hill. There is a couple of laughs, for me particularity the urination scene, but then the rest of the jokes where just typical stupid slap stick PG 13 gags mixed in with a whole heap of WTF moments that borderlined on slight humorous to just plain dumb.

Will we ever see the likes of a truly great parody film like those of the past, from Jim Abraham and the Zucker Brothers or the genius of Mel Brooks? Or do we just accept that only one those guys is still making parody films, and sitting back letting someone else do most of the work? When will parody films shine bright again? I have not given up all hope. But this movie can only be described as the typical ones of late not by the creators of all the ""(insert title here) movie"" apart from the Scary Movie franchise. It's better than the ""(insert title here) Movie"" but does not hold a candle to classics like Airplane, Spaceballs, Hot Shots, Naked Gun etc..",1377216000,,1418,4.350943396226415

5370318,1,B009WHDFOU,"ZERO STARS.  Nothing.  Nada.  (amazon needs a zero star rating)

Being amazon I am restrained from using certain language when describing movies (or in other reviews).  So, where I'd normally use a naughty word I will use the word spaghetti;  reading what I'm going to say will be more enjoyable than watching this movie...

This movie is a piece of spaghetti.  The writer is a worthless hack spaghetti.  The director should go back to spaghetti-ing llamas (there is a llama in this movie btw but it's not funny because this movie was written by an unfunny worthless piece of spaghetti).

Here you have a piece of spaghetti movie that's supposed to be a parody of other movies which should be pretty easy to make if you're funny.  I mean, parody means you can use whatever movie characters you want (it's protected free speech) in whatever situation you want without being legally responsible (maybe the ip owners should look into suing studios for the use of their characters in unfunny movies...)  Unfortunately, the worthless pieces of spaghetti that made this movie are unfunny spaghetti-s.  Who the spaghetti would make a PARODY movie and make it unfunny?  Absent all funniness.  I get all types of humor and this movie has none.  No dry humor, no environmental humor, no slapstick, nothing.  Spaghetti this movie!  Spaghetti it in the spaghetti!

Oh and whoever at FOX who decided this piece of spaghetti was anything other than a piece of spaghetti should be fired...out of a cannon into the moon.

DO NOT RENT, OWN, WATCH, or even curiously look at the packaging (in store) this movie...you have been warned.

SPAGHETTI!  This is piece of spaghetti!",1361750400,,1657,4.863799283154122

This ""spoof"" is levels beneath that.
Watching the movie was like a chore and I forced myself to watch it as punishment...seemed fitting.
Every stupid thing in this movie is like a bad joke and your just waiting for the punchline and then move on to the next.
Only problem is they're all awful.
If you want to make a spoof and only have one or two good jokes, for the love a God please get more jokes before making the movie.

5370325,1,B009WHDFOU,"Craig Moss may be the single most untalented writer and director that ever lived, as evidenced by 30 NIGHTS OF PARANORMAL ACTIVITY WITH THE DEVIL INSIDE THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO, the latest in low-brow Horror spoofs that is a disgrace to the art of filmmaking. Moss takes on everything from the ""found-footage"" genre to Storage Wars and other lame pop culture references, posing only the most basic and expected humor to an increasingly irritated audience. When the idiotic attempts at parody fail, Moss falls back on what he knows best: crude sex and fart jokes. Moss selfishly allows the awful cast to make complete fools of themselves on screen, ensuring their availability for his next project (should anyone allow him to work again). 30 NIGHTS OF PARANORMAL ACTIVITY WITH THE DEVIL INSIDE THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO should serve as an embarrassment to all parties involved in its creation, but especially to French Stewart, Peter Gilroy, and Tyler Phillips, who are most likely to face public ridicule for their performances. Without needing to see another film, 30 NIGHTS OF PARANORMAL ACTIVITY WITH THE DEVIL INSIDE THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO should be voted ""Worst in 2013.""

Frankly, I wished I played Russian Roulette with all six bullets instead. Hey, I love stupid gags and chuckle at tasteless humor, but I felt like I needed a shower after this one.  I think the biggest disappointment of this movie was the direction that French Stewart's career apparently has taken, because he is a geniunely funny guy. Instead, he takes a small role in 2013's biggest dud. I'm not sure if it's a bad combination of movies to spoof, horrible writing, or both, but the end result was non-stop unfunniness.  I have to wonder when the reveal to the actors, crew, director, and editors were as to how bad this script was.  My recommendation - avoid at all costs.

5370330,3,B009WHDFOU,"This is another multiple movie spoof. The main movie that is spoofed is ""Paranormal Activity 3"", considering the role of the pool crawler. If I claimed I got every spoof and pop culture reference, I would be a liar. The movie starts out with found footage of a man who killed the cast of ""The Artist"" in 1989. Clearly this is a spoof of the multiple anachronisms that have popped up in the Paranormal series. Fans of Adele and ""The Black Swan"" be forewarned as they are not treated kindly.

The humor is course and crude for too much of the film. It ruined what good scenes and satire the writers came up with. Early in the film they have multiple camera men shooting from different angles etc. Later in a scene we see the director. Again spoofs of the absurdity of these films. In addition to movies being spoofed, TV shows are spoofed as well as pop games and Internet porn.

Being hip to pop culture is a must to enjoy this film. If you enjoyed this feature, you might want to catch ""A Haunted House.""

8544688,1,B009WHDFOU,"It starts out for some reason, with a guy and a hot chick having sex.  It shortly turns into a Skittles parody or something, with the guy shooting a load of candies that they call Pittles.  Okay a little snicker.  Then it focuses on some reality show called Storage Battles.  It features 2 hostesses who paid $1200 for something inside of a public storage unit.  What they find is, a very poor parody of singer Adele doing a parody of Rollin' in the Deep filling them in that they just bought a small rug.  Ignoring her, they search around the place only to find a cliche' ""found footage"" VHS.  So they decide to play it in hopes to find something interesting.  As a result, the actual movie starts first showing a 911 call in early 1989 with some demonically possessed caller shouting the Subway five dollar foot long jingle and then through other weird voices, after some gross out details confesses to killing the cast of some movie called ""the Artist"".  Years pass and the possessed guys beautiful and incredibly smokin' hot daughter goes to Italy where for some reason he has been sent to seek mental health.  After some really unfunny insanity and weirdness, her father(played by 3rd Rock From the Sun's French Stewart) contacts some sexy call girls and asks his daughter to leave.  More years pass, our sexy main character meets a guy on one of those male bachelor reality shows, they get hot for eachother right off, and more years later they get married and have a little girl.  Still more years pass and they're daughter is a moody goth teenage parody of  that freaky reporter chick from ""the Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"".  Also, they had another child who's just a baby and not at all important to this movie.  Also, there's their sexual deviant gardener and some unexplained British ghost.

To sum it up, there's just nothing that's funny in the slightest about this movie.  All of the so-called attempts at humor are nothing more than random and misplaced at best.  The daughter having a crush on Abe Lincoln, who just happens to live next door for example neither featured him as president nor as a ""Vampire Hunter"".  The stupid scenes where the security cameras pan around to feature random jokes such as: a llama with a part hat on, a mariachi band, and the ghost quickly redecorating the rooms didn't even make sense.  The stupid multiple edits of the ghost forcefully dragging the main character down the street just to buy some snack of some kind from a convenient didn't make any sense nor was it funny at all.  Worst of all, you don't even get to know who this annoying ghost is and why he is even there.  Being forced sexually by a ghost is definitely not funny.  Having the gardener dress up like Nina from the Black Swan just served no purpose at all either.  The scene were they parody that insurance icon, Mayhem was a little funny, I'll admit.  The idiot reality show ghost hunting brothers were not only damn annoying but their behavior was just too juvenile to laugh at. And you guessed it, when they didn't have any other sort of unfunny jokes to display, they sunk so low as to institute an occasional fart joke.  The storyline is pretty non-existent for the most part, every joke in this travesty of a movie is poorly timed, doesn't make sense, and is more for reference purposes than actually being funny and relevant,  the nudity is good, but there's not much of it, the actors are talentless and dry, the humor is delivered in an earnest and deadpan fashion rather than silly, and above all, this movie is completely forgettable.

I didn't much care for Ghost Team One, but at least that movie tried and at times was funny.  I've never felt such a shear lack of desire to laugh at a comedy in my life.  Even the weakest of the sequels from the Scary Movie franchise tried harder than this steaming pile of crap.  If you want a good laugh, do yourself a favor and neither watch this turd nor rent it for friends or family.  You'd be much better off avoiding this exercise in comedic futility like the plague.",1441497600,4,4042,4.563106796116505
8544689,4,B009WHDFOU,"This is the first new parody movie that has come out in a long time that I have actually enjoyed.

It was funny, it had characters in it that weren't just walking stereotypes or complete morons, it parodied current movies, and a number of them were actual GOOD movies which was a nice change.  It parodied Girl With the Dragon Tattoo, Batman, Exorcist, Abe Lincoln Vampire Hunter, Paranormal Activity 1-4, and even the reality TV show ""The Apprentice.""

However I am not sure what the goat or the turkey was from.  And the part with the Hunger Games joke was kinda a throw away gag that I felt really didn't belong in this movie.  It didn't add anything to the movie other than to remind you that the Hunger Games came out a few years ago.

It's a good parody movie and it doesn't take itself too seriously.  If you like these types of movies, you should check it out! :-)",1426896000,,872,4.37888198757764
