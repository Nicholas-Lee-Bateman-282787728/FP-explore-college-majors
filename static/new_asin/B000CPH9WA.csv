8100011,3,B000CPH9WA,"This is just a very basic beginner course in learning the trombone. Glad it wasn't much money, since he may not even continue with it.",1393027200,,134,4.4
8100012,2,B000CPH9WA,"This is not what I hoped it would be.  I should have read the fine print.  This dvd proclaims itself to be ""The ultimate self-teaching method.""  It tells you have to assemble and maintain your instrument, how to produce sounds, how to read music.  It gives you a chance to play songs with a ""backup band.""  Does that sound great?  Sure it does.  Do you think you can legitimately do that in 22 minutes of instruction?  Ah...nope.  Yes, this DVD, this ""ultimate self-teaching method,"" is 22 minutes long.

This would be a great thing to pass out free with a new trombone.  But it's not a self-teaching method.  I imagine that the average buyer will be as disappointed as I was.",1255046400,6,676,4.4958677685950414
8100013,4,B000CPH9WA,"Perfect if you decide to take on Trombone.  You will get the necessary info to get going right away, and playing in no time. It even shows you how to assemble it, it starts that basic.  Walks you through step by step.",1144022400,6,217,4.142857142857143
