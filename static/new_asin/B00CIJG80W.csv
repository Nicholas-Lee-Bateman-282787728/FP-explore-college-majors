5722884,5,B00CIJG80W,The production value and old footage is outstanding. I brilliant insight to the band that started the NWOBHM and what we now call Speed and Thrash. They were it before anyone. And after 35+years of doing they are still going strong today. Total respect and admiration for these guys. If you don't know about this band then you truly aren't a metal head. And if you do know about this band and don't buy this DVD you a damn fool!,1378080000,,428,4.3625
5722885,4,B00CIJG80W,"The Gallagher brothers could have been SAS warriors. Instead they chose to play music. Awesome choice .I personally think the 1st 3 from Raven are Epic. Unfortunately due to clueless label owners and  a bad decision by the boys,their style changed after All For One. This dvd if properly manufactured would be a 5 star product. Unfortunately as the first reviewer stated ,,there are playback issues. You basically have to manually hit on your remote each chapter. I could not watch dvd in one press of play button. Shame because there is some great footage here. Not of the best picture quality by 21st century standard but much of stuff was recorded with 1980s tech. The company that released this must do the mighty Raven a service and correct the playability issues,which is why me gives only 3 stars. A fan should not have to pay $$$ and get a product that you basically have to play each chapter individually to watch dvd. Defect only occurs on disc One. Disc two is issue free. Wish Rob Hunter would rejoin band .I think it is awesome when a great band keeps all original members throughout their whole career. I would totally dig playin drums for Raven. Totally under appreciated band,but to those in the know,,Raven = Mighty Force..",1376784000,3,1240,4.714285714285714
5722886,5,B00CIJG80W,3 man band that were crazy!!!  MUST HAVE!!  These guys till rock today!!!!!!!  Must see these guys live great show and John plays a 12 string bass like a guitar!!,1376611200,,162,4.333333333333333
5722887,1,B00CIJG80W,"I don't know what to think.

I'm on my 2nd DVD now, and having the same exact issues. The menu is all off! When you try to navigate through the menu options some option are highlighted and at other times you have no idea were your cursor is. You think you are playing the movie but once it gets to chapter two, it stops and brings you right back to the main menu. I've also attempted starting from other chapters and get the same results.

I've tried playing it on my desktop & laptops, I've tried on multiple DVD players in my home and having the same issues with the menu navigation and playback.

Very frustrating mainly because I'm a huge RAVEN fan, so getting my hands on not one but two copies and not being able to watch it from beginning to end it killing me.

I would assume there is an issue with the production of the DVD's or at least that is my feeling.",1375142400,6,866,4.167664670658683

8582050,3,B00CIJG80W,"More of a rockumentary than anything else.  Too much filler and not enough killer (noise).  Supposedly 3 hours of the story of Raven.  Endless interviews with John Gallagher and others about their history, recordings, tours, etc.  Could have used some judicious editing and a lot more music.  The concert videos are annoying because the author/editor/producer of this video decided to splice together different vintages of the band doing each song live.  The picture quality on these concert videos goes from horrible to almost DVD quality all during the same song.  I've never seen this done before and I own at least 100 DVD's and Blu-rays of concerts, music videos, rockumentaries, etc.  The 2nd DVD in the box supposedly has 5 different versions of each song on the track list.  I think that is the blending or splicing of 5 different vintage of the band doing the same song.  It wasn't palatable on the 1st disc where the songs are edited for length/time.  I guess you could say at least they are not edited (but still spliced) on the 2nd disc.  I could not watch every minute of the first disc and I could not watch/listen to all of the 2nd disc.  I just grabbed my copy of the All Systems Go Neat Anthology of Raven and rocked out like these discs should have.  Very disappointed.",1502323200,,1287,4.662222222222222
8582051,4,B00CIJG80W,The only reason it's not 5 stars is the menu buttons do not work as they should. The video itself is pretty amazining!! Raven are a true hard rock band. No pretentiousness at all.,1453248000,,179,4.294117647058823

8582053,4,B00CIJG80W,"An intersting doc LOADED w/ old footage and the like. Very long (over 4 hours), always a pus. Fan or not, you will enjoy this DVD. A must addition to the collection!",1408406400,,165,4.1875

8582055,4,B00CIJG80W,"I really like Raven and this dvd is pretty good. lots of old footage so if your a fan of the 80's stuff this is for you. yeah, you keep getting sent back to the menu after each chapter and it is a little ""low budget"" but if your a Raven fan you will ignore the flaws and want to see it because it is interesting. I bought this last year so I don't know if they fixed the menu issue.",1396742400,,382,3.728395061728395
8582056,5,B00CIJG80W,A great behind the scenes look with awesome live performances from Raven. These guys know what metal is all about!!,1392768000,,115,4.8
8582057,5,B00CIJG80W,"First off, like the other reviewers here, the copy I bought of this DVD has some technical glitches: namely, at the end of each ""chapter"" of the DVD, it goes back to the DVD chapter screen and you have to manually start the next ""chapter"".  It is slightly irritating, but it is a minor irritant and certainly not a reason to not purchase this DVD.  Also, I got this in Summer 2013 when it was first released, so maybe the newer copies of this if you order now have been fixed.  I hope so.  I'd hate to see a minor glitch like this ruin the success of such a cool product.

Unlike the documentary about their fellow metal contemporaries ANVIL, this DVD looks to have been made in-house by the band themselves.  Unlike the ANVIL documentary, it isn't a feel-good story that will appeal to the great unwashed public who have never heard of the band.  Instead, this is a fantastic, all-inclusive history for fans of a great, in some ways under-appreciated British metal band who were part not only of the early 80s UK NWOBHM scene, but also prime movers in the early-mid 80s US thrash scene when they moved to the US and hooked up with Megaforce Records and, ultimately, major label Atlantic.  The DVD touches on their whole history, from their late 70s genesis in Newcastle, England through the NWOBHM years, their early 80s tours with bands like Accept and Metallica (who opened for Raven on their first US tour), their polarizing mid-80s albums on Atlantic, and the post-Atlantic years with drummer Joe Hasselvander.  There's a whole lot of previously super-rare live footage from the early 80s onward (the second DVD is all-live footage), lots of interviews with band members John, Joe and Mark, as well as journalists like Ron Quintana and Brian Lew, fellow musicians like Lars Ulrich, Udo Dirkschneider, Lips from Anvil, etc., producer Michael Wagner, and many others.  Bottom line, if you're a Raven fan (which I am), this DVD will give you hours of entertainment.

Criticisms?  It is maybe a bit-over long and unfocused which, again, if you're a hardcore fan like me, matters little, but the viewer who doesn't know the band or the casual fan may get a little overwhelmed.  The fact that entire songs are placed in the middle of the ""story"" kind of detracts from the documentary portion, and is unnecessary given that the 2nd DVD is all-live footage.  Further, putting in footage from the 90s or 2000s when the ""story"" is still in the early 80s breaks up the flow of the film--there's obviously enough ""contemporary"" footage to have made this unnecessary.  Also, it's too bad that original drummer Rob ""Wacko"" Hunter wasn't interviewed for the film -- he was a big part of the band until he left in '87, and his perspective would have been valuable. Finally, the sound for some of the interview footage, especially (ironically) the interviews with bassist/singer John Gallagher, is much lower than the rest of the film and requires a lot of futzing about with volume levels while watching the DVD.

All minor quibbles: this DVD is a great, all-inclusive film about one of the most crushing and bizarrely under-appreciated heavy rock bands ever.  An absolute essential for fans of this great band.",1385942400,4,3200,4.768115942028985
8582058,4,B00CIJG80W,"A poorly documented band with little history on video is finally in my hands! It actually reached me on my birthday! The quality is a little on the ""meh"" side, the menus seem like they are thrown together, sometimes the video skips too and the audio mix is not the best but Raven is one of the most monumental and influential metal bands in history. I was only 5 or 6 when they toured with Metallica on the Kill em All for one tour and tore up the stages of Roseland and Lamour in NY so until I get that time machine this video will have to do! A must have as a historical document for all the nu-metal kids to show them where the big boys hang!",1379462400,,645,4.046875
