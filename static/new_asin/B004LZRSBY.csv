4428285,5,B004LZRSBY,"As a child of the 80's this is a great DVD. I was a fan when ""Take on Me"" came out. They made one of the best music videos of all time. However I never got the opportunitly to see them live. So the DVD will have to do. What a great Blu-Ray DVD. Amazing video and audio quality. It really makes your HD TV and Blu-Ray player shine. Its just about the best DVD as far as quality that I own. If you are a child of the 80's I don't think you will be disappointed if you purchase it.",1306886400,,478,3.742574257425743
4428286,5,B004LZRSBY,It was an excellent final show.  Morten's voice was better than I've heard it in a while.  They all really made the effort to make this last show a good one.,1306800000,,157,4.032258064516129
4428287,5,B004LZRSBY,"The quaity of this blu ray disc is the best I have ever seen.
THe music content is great for any Aha lovers.
I highly reccomend this to everyone.",1306800000,,145,4.0344827586206895
4428288,5,B004LZRSBY,"Amazon shipped this last weekend to my place.  I have been playing the blu-ray on a daily basis since then.

First off a-ha delivered a picture perfect performance.  Morten's voice is amazing through out the whole show.  They played all their big hits from the 80's, as well selections from their last 4 albums (2001 and onwards).  A total of 20 songs.

The Blu-ray is shot crystal clear.  Unlike U2's Rose Bowl Blu-ray, this one is actually shot in 1080p.  There are no blurry, or grainy shots, seems like these Europeans know how to a shoot a good concert.

The sound is also really good.  Two options, either Stereo 2.0 channel or DTS-Master HD for those that have sound systems capable of handling that.  You can hear every instrument and vocal harmony very clearly.

All in all one of the best blu-rays that I have ever seen (I have a huge collection at home, from Rush to U2).  I was sad after the show, since I probably will never ever get to see this amazing band live.",1305331200,,977,4.451977401129944
4428289,5,B004LZRSBY,This is the best concert dvd I have ever seen. 2 full hours of pure musical enjoyment. I'm sorry that there won't be any more concerts from a-ha. They will be missed.,1305244800,,166,4.21875
4428290,5,B004LZRSBY,"I received my BluRay copy of a-ha's ""Ending on a High Note"" last week, and have watched it straight through multiple times now.  As a life long fan, this has been a long time coming.  It is such a breath of fresh air to find a region free a-ha DVD here in the states.

This beautifully filmed concert experience is a must for any music lover.  It looks and sounds amazing!  The band have never sounded better- which is sad, considering this is their last outting as such.  I was fortunate enough to see them in NYC last May, and this DVD really brought much of that experience back to me.

Every song is a gem- from The Sun Always Shines on TV, to Take On Me.  For those of you to whom the rest are unfamiliar, you will not be disappointed.  This is truly a concert experience.  If you thought that these guys were a ""one hit wonder"", your jaw will drop at the throngs of adoring fans that descended upon Oslo for this show from all over the globe.  It is heartwarming.

Get the BluRay- you will not be disappointed.  And then go ahead and get ""Minor Earth, Major Sky"", ""Lifelines"", ""Analogue"", and ""Foot of the Mountain"".  Then you will realize what this amazing band has been up to for the past decade or so, and what you have been missing all these years.  :)",1304899200,28,1262,4.265822784810126
4428291,5,B004LZRSBY,"I received my blu-ray copy in the mail today (I'm actually watching it right now) and am blown away by the sound and picture quality.  A-ha sound as good, if not better, than they have on any of their studio albums.  I should have watched the whole thing before I wrote this, but I'm already 100% satisfied :)

The stage, background, crowd... everything is perfect and visually stunning.  The arrangements of familiar classics are fresh and unique, without losing the well-loved sound of the originals.  I can't remember if the product listing includes the full track listing, but it's a wonderful mix of the old and new.  Of course I have favorites I wished were included, but I'm a die-hard fan and 20 songs could never be enough!

Okay, I just watched the bonus features.  Not a lot to speak of, but still a very touching (if short) look at how A-ha has effected people all over the world.  I wasn't expecting a wealth of bonus features, and for the price I am absolutely MORE than satisfied.  A must-have for every A-ha fan!!",1304640000,9,1029,4.573770491803279
4428292,5,B004LZRSBY,"A-ha's final concert in Oslo is beautifully shot and sounds amazing. The band never sounded better and Morten's voice is just beautiful, he absolutely sounds amazing on this! I am so sad the band is coming to an end... it seems to early! Their albums in the 00's-10's were their best and what a shame the US only knows Take On Me!

Lot's of energy in this concert. They do play all of their known favorites here. Twenty songs and close to two full hours long, wish I could have been there for this HISTORICAL concert.

This DVD helps bring this show to your home. If you have not seen them LIVE then you should certainly feel this experience!

4428306,5,B004LZRSBY,"A bittersweet moment of highly accomplished artists transitioning in one amazing way to other musical and creative ventures. A band that never truly got the respect they deserved in America...and this makes me sad for America. Those who enjoy this amazing live show should make sure to pick up the solo works of Morten Harket, especially his latest, Brother.",1401235200,,358,5.084745762711864
4428307,5,B004LZRSBY,"I'll always love <3 more than half of A-ha's album versions of their songs :) .  Concert wise, I think A-ha has come a long way from the 2002 DVD of 2001 Live At Vallhall. Morten Harket closes his eyes so much (in most of his past live performances), I don't know if he was sleepy, bored, too shy, like a choir boy singing ""Take On Me"" or (talk about) ""The Sun Always Shines on TV"" :( , and Pal Waaktaar and Magne Furuhomen wanted to rock-out but are just too prim and proper to do so. I mean for me, more than half of their songs are adrenaline motivators, but prior to ""Ending on a High Note"" their interpretation renders me like Superman near a Kryptonite :( gravity pulling me to the ground.

Sweet surprise ! :)  In the end, they began to come around :)  Love it <3 :)",1400976000,,773,4.099337748344371

4428309,5,B004LZRSBY,"This is a legacy worth adding to your Blu-Ray concert collection.
  The Hi-Def picture and lossless sound were reference quality.
  Sound selection was very good...of course, you can't please everyone.
  (I would have liked to have seen them perform one of my personal favorites, ""Velvet"".
 A-Ha was overlooked in the U.S., but is much more than ""Take On Me"".
  Take a minute to explore the songs on A-Ha 25 Greatest Double CD.

4428318,2,B004LZRSBY,"If you're not already a devoted AHA fan, this won't make you one. Video and audio quality is good however the band's sound is extremely processed and monotonous. I suspect the appeal of the singers is attributable to their looks as they don't really have all that much stage charisma.",1375401600,2,284,4.7
4428319,4,B004LZRSBY,"This was a wonderful, nostalgic visit to some of my favorite A-Ha songs. (I saw them in concert on their first visit to America when Hunting High and Low was released.) My only quibble was that, for me, there were way too many closeup shots of Morten's tongue and Pal's whiskers and wrinkles in the first half.  The videographers could have created more flattering shots that wouldn't have been so distracting, unless they were actually trying to show them warts and all. Quibbles aside, this was a good video in which the performances kept getting better during the course of the concert,  and worth watching again.",1373500800,2,616,4.80188679245283
4428320,5,B004LZRSBY,"The Final Concert, ""Going out on a High Note"", is the perfect description of this concert. I never got to see them live in the 80s so this was my chance to see them and hear the. Although they are most likely in their 40's they still had the energy and emotional connection to their fans with their music. Plus they can still sing, especially the lead singer with his high notes. I highly recommend this Blu Ray concert,",1372118400,,420,4.329113924050633
4428321,5,B004LZRSBY,"Well listening to the start I thought Morten sounded a bit croaky, and was a bit concerned but after the first couple of songs he got stronger and stronger and by the end of the concert he sounded at his best! Fabulous performance from all of the band, particularly loved the drummer, he was great :)

Very sad I wasn't there and this was there last concert, perhaps another one day? I hope so :)

Quality of this is awesome! Video and Sound quality amazing",1371686400,,457,4.364705882352941

4428326,5,B004LZRSBY,"""Ending On A High Note: Final Concert"" is a brilliantly played performance that showcases powerful music harmony among the band members. ""The Sun Always Shines On TV"",  ""Manhattan Skyline"", ""Hunting High And Low"", ""Butterfly Butterfly (The Last Hurrah)"", ""Foot Of The Mountain"" and ""Take On Me"" were some of my favorite performances of the concert.  There is a complete listing of the concert songs on A-ha's storefront website from playdotcom.  ""Ending On A High Note: The Final Concert"" is best for those who like at least three songs by A-Ha and/or  pop music spanning from the 80's to the early 2000's.",1352160000,,606,4.97029702970297
4428327,5,B004LZRSBY,"After seeing the concert I realized that it's been a long journey since Scoundrel Days.  Morten's face shows the long way and so does it's voice, however the passion and love for the music is still much there.  This disk is a summary of memories and would be much appreciated for the people who's been along the way.  If you're a fan then it's a must.",1346371200,2,351,4.287878787878788

That was rather disappointing. As for the concert, the music and performances, they were simply fantastic. I was amazed actually, because the music and performances seemed so flawless. This is quite a moving DVD if you have been a long time fan of a-ha or ever been touched by their music. Yes, it is aptly named. They did absolutely end on a high note.",1345161600,,520,4.158415841584159
4428329,5,B004LZRSBY,"I like many people here in the U.S. missed out on a-ha for the last 25 years.  Hunting High and Low was the first album I ever bought, sadly, it took me until now to rediscover them.  This is definitely one of the top five concert blu-rays that I own.  The only one I would definitely put ahead of this is Queen Rock Montreal & Live Aid (that film is incredible in itself considering how long ago it was shot).  Jeff Beck Live at Ronnie Scott's is a great concert blu-ray, but comparing that to this concert is like comparing apples to oranges.  The performance here is stellar.  All the band members are at the peak of their game.  The sound mixing is excellent.  Stage setup and visuals at the concert are incredible.  Cinematography and visual mixing is excellent.  Can't give this enough stars.  Now I'm going back and buying all the albums that I missed out on!  Hopefully a-ha will see how much they are missed and somehow see to unretire at some point (30th anniverary tour?), and hopefully make one last visit to the U.S.A. for all the stupid people like me who missed out on them all these years...

As an aside, when I first heard the song ""We're Looking for the Whales"", the song sounded so fresh, I thought it must have been from one of a-ha's last albums...I was shocked when I found out the song was on the album Scoundrel Days...a 26 year old album!!!

I've also come to realize one of the factors in a-ha deciding to retire is that for someone Morten's age to continue singing all those impossible high notes...it just can't be done forever...",1335916800,9,1559,4.443661971830986

Of course, I bought this DVD the day it came out, and am not at all disappointed: sound and image are both excellent. I consider it my best music dvd, together with....Live at Vallhall by.... A-HA !",1321574400,2,433,4.228915662650603
4428336,5,B004LZRSBY,"A-ha's ""Ending on a High Note: Final Concert"" is a very pleasant concert, aurally and visually.  The band and the audience are polite, pleasing, and gracious.

The stage has three huge and sophisticated high tech backscreens, displaying constantly changing images.

Techno pop elements are on most of the songs, including their hit ""Take On Me"".  That is the only song which I and probably most people know, here in the States.  Their overall sound is delightful and has a nice feel to it.

A-ha has been around for about 25 years, and all three original band members look fairly fit and lean.  In addition, there are two new people with the band.

Audio options are PCM Stereo and DTS MA 5.1.

Here is the song list.
1. The Sun Always Shines On TV
2. Move To Memphis
3. The Blood That Moves The Body
4. Scoundrel Days
5. The Swing Of Things
6. Forever Not Yours
7. Stay On These Roads
8. Manhattan Skyline
9. Hunting High And Low
10. We're Looking For The Whales
11. Butterfly, Butterfly (The Last Hurrah)
12. Crying In The Rain
13. Minor Earth, Major Sky
14. Summer Moved On
15. I've Been Losing You
16. Foot Of The Mountain
17. Cry Wolf
18. Analogue
19. The Living Daylights
20. Take On Me

At 20 songs, and about one hour and 48 minutes, this concert is long.

of spectacular in blu-ray.
In this emotional performance, it is clearly seen that the band gives

4428340,4,B004LZRSBY,"This is a nice concert but one can't help but feel that A-ha was right in their decision to retire.  25 years on, it feels like I just bought my first A-ha album last week...but time has flown.  As I watched Morten, Mags and Pal in close-up, I realised that an era had come to a close.  If their faces were anything to go by in this show, it was time.

Despite delivering the hits, I could almost sense the fire and passion smouldering even as the boys played the right songs and hit the right notes.  Part of it felt a little funereal.  They seem melancholy in this show somehow, only cracking a smile now and then.

A-ha has never been less than professional. Yet, despite their tight musicianship, a strange repression of passion in this final act seemed to permeate as one song played after another.  No longer young exuberant pop-meisters, the trio looked decidedly more worn but still cut a striking sight.

So this was a modest and polite farewell - not about striking a high note. For a band that's delivered many emotive pieces, they kept their feelings in check.  Goodbye A-ha.",1319414400,3,1087,4.5
4428341,5,B004LZRSBY,"I've been an a-ha ""fan"" for over 20 years. And I say a ""fan"" because what I've heard from them was 3 or 4 songs. I bought this disc because a) is a bluray, and b) it has The Sun Always Shines on TV (my favorite). The whole show is amazing, the voices, although not the same as 20 years ago, are great also.

4428343,5,B004LZRSBY,"I just finished watching the blu-ray of their farewell concert. It was tremendous, with each song a burst of memories and emotion flowed through me. I admit some songs brought tears to my eyes. They sounded great, like when I saw them in California in 1985, I believe. Highly recommended!",1312675200,,288,4.78

4428345,5,B004LZRSBY,"I ended up having to purchase this somewhere else. I get so mad when the advertise a DVD and it arrives in PAL format. Amazon quickly refunded my money and paid for the shipping. This turned out well as where I did buy it from sold it for less than half price of what Amazon wanted for it.

I did talk to customer service at Amazon and they know they have a problem with the PAL discs being offered with NTSC discs they need to separate the two

The concert is fabulous, even better than Live at Valhall which is also a very good one to own. I am proud to be of Norwegian heritage.",1308441600,,581,4.043478260869565
4428346,5,B004LZRSBY,"Just finished viewing the performance. It is amazing and mind blowing with the evergreen rich vocals of Morten backed by powerful synth of Magne and Guitar by Waaktaar Savoy.
This group has been one of the sensations in the area of pop music. From the lyrics to the rich vocals of Morten the group always touched the chord of your inner self. Being a die hard fan of A-ha it is sad that we won't hear the group any more, but for those who only savoured rock music, it is time you guys purchase this item and soak in the music.
Wish the group stayed little longer......

4428347,5,B004LZRSBY,"a-ha's Ending on a High Note tour concludes in beautiful Oslo.  If you are an a-ha fan, this video is a must have!  All the hits are represent and a-ha interacts with the audience, sometimes you can see the emotion in the faces of the band as they address the crowd in what is being billed as their last concert ever.  The production value is high here and needed as a-ha are a sonically dynamic band and the audio quality is great while the visual resolution of the BluRay is very sharp.
If you are a fan, this is a great buy!",1308182400,,527,4.147058823529412
4428348,5,B004LZRSBY,"I was not an ardent fan of a-ha.  I only knew their most popular hits before this.  This concert blew me away, it was fantastic both visually and in sound.  I loved many of the songs even on the first listening.  The only bad thing ... now I'll have to go to the stores to get their albums.",1307836800,,290,3.9482758620689653
4428349,5,B004LZRSBY,"The best way to view the bands final concert (other than being in Oslo last Dec. 4) is on blu-ray.  While the NTSC dvd in the ""Deluxe Edition"" is extremely poor quality and is missing the documentary and photo gallery, the blu-ray looks sharp and has both extras.  I just wish the blu-ray came in an edition (like the dvd) with the 2 cds included.",1307318400,,347,4.323076923076923
4428350,4,B004LZRSBY,"I enjoyed watching this vid from a-ha's goodbye tour. I was able to see them in New York City live last May 2010 and enjoyed seeing the bigger and better show they provided their fans in Oslo.

Vid and sound quality were tremendous. The extra's (even though not enough) were great.

If I had any gripe, I wish they had made a companion cd to include all their videos from over the years.

Does anyone out there know of a good blu-ray version of where I could get their vids?",1307318400,2,474,4.2444444444444445
