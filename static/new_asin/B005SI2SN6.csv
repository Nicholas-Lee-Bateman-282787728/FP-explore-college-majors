8485131,4,B005SI2SN6,"This was a pretty good introduction to thinking about, and creating voices for puppets and vent figures.  My main issue is that  the main instruction portion was filmed in front of an audience, and time is taken up with the audience (all at once) trying to produce examples of the various voices that Liz is describing.  I'd like to see a similar video with perhaps ONE other person practicing the voice, so that the nuances could be clearly heard.  It would even be good if it were longer time-wise and just a lecture and demonstration of how to do the varied voices.  It is worth the price,however, because I really don't know of any other similar DVDs or videos out there that touch on the topic of voices.
Glad I bought it,",1418169600,,727,4.4772727272727275
