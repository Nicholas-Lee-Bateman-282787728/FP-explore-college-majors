8760873,5,B01FJ3FR14,"This is probably the best adult movie made since The Opening of Misty Beethoven. It's filled with subtle commentary on the predictability of both sexual and narrative plots that drive almost all of today's porn. Although there is plenty of sex in this movie, this is not a jerk-off flick. It's the best attempt to make a real movie with adult performers and hard core sex out there. The sex scenes actually follow and support the narrative arc of the film, getting progressively more intense as it develops, ending with an incredibly tense and hot dungeon scene. Great cinematography, subtle scoring, relevant topic. But definitely more of a romantic movie.",1527033600,,657,4.9818181818181815
8760874,2,B01FJ3FR14,"I wanted sooooo badly to enjoy this movie. I heard rave reviews about it on all of my favorite podcasts. I had a movie night with my husband and girlfriend to screen it. They were both bored to tears. I couldn't get past the new age music that played too loudly over all of the sex scenes. And the pacing was way too slow. I fully appreciate the mission here and I believe in the message of the movie, but I just didn't enjoy the execution at all.

The one enjoyable scene was the basement scene! That was super hot! Also I loved Nina Hartley and Reid Mihalko.",1509667200,,560,4.185185185185185

8760876,4,B01FJ3FR14,"Wander the Internet or your neighborhood and it's clear: throughout our culture, much of what was true 20 years ago is not necessarily the case now. Our relationships, romantic and otherwise, are in many ways beginning to reflect these new realities. Set against the vivid, natural beauty of Northern California and San Francisco, Marriage 2.0 follows a couple (India Summer and Ryan Driller) on their search for personal freedom, emotional and sexual bliss within the context of an honest and committed modern relationship. What makes Marriage 2.0 a different kind of relationship movie is its frankness; for all the pleasures of open relationships, jealousy and vulnerability do not magically disappear. This love letter to San Francisco - the cultural epicenter of the alternative relationship movement - suggests that the ideas of growth, novelty, and sexual adventure can exist within a millennial marriage. Marriage 2.0 tells a story both timely and universal. In the company of its diverse and storied cast including: Ryan Driller, India Summer, Andre Shakti, Mickey Mod, Sadie Lune, Dylan Ryan, Beretta James, Daisy Ducati, Christian Wilde, Juniper Gold and erotic cinema legend Nina Hartley; accompanied by many luminaries of the sex-positive community, including Carol Queen, Emily Morse, Reid Mihalko, and noted TED speaker and author of the NY Times best-seller Sex At Dawn Christopher Ryan, we are invited to celebrate a modern redefinition of the committed relationship - as a dynamic springboard for adventure, where unfettered physical and emotional intimacy can fuel our passion while strengthening the bond with those we love.",1492041600,,1644,5.450980392156863
