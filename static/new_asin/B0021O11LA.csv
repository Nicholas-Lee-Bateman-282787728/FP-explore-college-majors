3841180,4,B0021O11LA,"Ghosts in a house is a serious business if they interrupted with a couple's intimacy and damaged young husband's reputation and career, especially.

The rest is a fun as producers explored social aspects of homosexuality and its application to a recent French environment.",1375574400,3,272,5.325581395348837
3841181,4,B0021O11LA,"This film (in French with clear English subtitles) is a fun way to spend a 'snowed in' evening in front of the TV. It's not challenging, it is rather tacky (but in a funny way) and is based on a novel idea - young couple buy run down house and he discovers it's 'possessed' by five poltergays from the 1970s. It's not scary (but then doesn't try to be) it is funny; albeit in a clichd way. It won't be everyone's cup of tea, but is an unchallenging way to wind down after a long day at work. (It took me a week to get 'Boney M's ""Ra Ra Rasputin"" out of my head - but every time I found myself humming it I was smiling at the memory of the movie - maybe That's Scary!!!).",1269302400,6,670,3.9338235294117645

8349375,3,B0021O11LA,"It is funny and original, but a big print warning:  It is French and the English subtitles are slightly off.  Why only 3 stars?  I thought the ending was flat and weak.  It was if the money had all been spent making the first 3/4 of the movie and they had only 30 minutes left to film the ending.",1407369600,,296,3.9661016949152543
