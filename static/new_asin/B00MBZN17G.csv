The main character Seamus is an adoring character that keeps finding himself in troubling situations albeit mostly from his own poor choices. This movie does a good job of keeping things moving quickly from one scene to the next keeping you interested throughout the film, and it is not for the faint of heart as there is some...well, raw scenes. But overall a fantastic indie film that enjoyed start to finish, well worth the price.",1406851200,,605,4.663551401869159
8671566,5,B00MBZN17G,"Pu Pu Platter is an over the top comedy movie of 2014, and is finished filming in 2013. It's for sure one of the funny movies to watch. It might contain many crazy scenes and improper languages, but after all we weren't trying to be proper nor we were trying to pass judgment on any type of characters. We portray them like we  would see them in the real world. We don't sugar coat them and we don't vilify them.

Like the character in the Pu Pu Platter uncle Tommy played by Andy Brosseau, a Vietnam veteran, who is a little out of touch, a satyr with Asian fetish, and is also an uncle of those who love him and accepted him for his craziness. His innocent suggestions often sent people to their death or jinxed them into a tar pit, and he felt deeply cursed. In real life, we've seen characters like uncle Tommy over and over, who's constantly said the wrong and awkward things, and often with bizarre behaviors. He's never meant to embarrass or hurt anyone, he's just being himself, and that, as the result, led him to be blamed. As funny and misfortune as uncle Tommy is, without his comical characteristic, Pu Pu Platter wouldn't be one of those funny movies to watch. We hope that you like uncle Tommy with a big open heart and see him through your humorous eyes.

Pu Pu Platter is made by a group of dedicated artists, we have learned so much in this process, and humbled ourselves through the journey we took on. We hope that Pu Pu Platter will be your choice of funny movies to watch.",1406851200,,1494,4.347670250896058
