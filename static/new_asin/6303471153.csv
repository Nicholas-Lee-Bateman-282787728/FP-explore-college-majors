664488,4,6303471153,"Richard cracks me up, and he leads a great workout. His routines take a  little time to learn, but once you have them down, they're fun! This  routine has the advantage of interval training. He does one song at a lower  intensity, then cranks it up for one song, and drops back down for the  next. This continues on through the good long workout. Someone who is new  to exercise would be better off using his Blast Off or Sweatin' to the  Oldies tapes to start. But when you're ready for nearly 40 minutes of  sweatin', this is a fun routine! (Beginner to Intermediate would be my  recommendation)",965001600,6,597,4.462962962962963
664489,5,6303471153,"I just recieved Disco Sweat today and tried it for the first time and it was wonderful. Richard is so inspirational. Tears came to my eyes as I worked out with Richard and his friends because he really makes you feel  like you can do it.  I weigh 243lbs and have lived a seditary lifestyle  since I became pregnant 3 1/2 years ago. I began to hate how I looked and  felt with all of the extra weight I gained, but Richard has given me the  inspiration I need to get moving and keep going. I strongly reccommend this  tape for anyone who needs that extra push. You won't regret it.  :-)",955929600,3,585,4.169642857142857
664490,5,6303471153,"I love Richard Simmons! I've loved him since I was just a wee lass and being a lucky enough person to get this disco sweat video I have really benefitted. Going from 398 pounds to 250 really was a big step for me and I  think that I owe Mr. Simmons my sucess! Thanks to him, I am one disco  master mama and a boppity boo bop boppin' fool.

664491,5,6303471153,"I own all 3 Sweatin' to the Oldies videos and just received the Disco video.  This is Richard at his cheeziest - but also at his most motivational.  I did it for the first time last night and the 70 min. FLEW.  I'm 50 years old, just a bit (15 lbs) overweight, a bit arthritic in my  hip joints, etc. etc. but instead of complaining I'm stretching, breathing,  and flinging it about in the privacy of my home in sweaty abandon with  Richard cheering me on.  When I leave for a busy day at work I'm primed and  ready.
Just ordered the toning video and can't wait.  My advise is get  the video, get off your duff and get healthy!",951696000,8,627,4.15

Anyone can start getting physically fit with this video and without all the annoying super fit people laughing at your fat jiggling!  If I can do it anyone can.  Sure, Richard is cheesy, but he makes it fun--you can always laugh at him!  Plus  at the end you see the people and how much weight they have lost and it's  inspirational. The best part is the people's outfits and the cheesy DJ.  The music is great, no pulsating techno! Give ol' Dick a try! And  remember.. You had the munchies, now its time to do the crunchies!",948672000,24,575,4.308411214953271
664493,5,6303471153,"Richard Simmons is to the horizontally challenged what Bill Parcells was to the New York Jets.  He is such an awesome motivator and coach thatI wish I could hire him to be my personal trainer. Now when I started this video I  was weighing in at 375 lbs.  I was hating life and hating myself.  After 3  weeks of intense training with Richard I am now weighing in at a svelte 360  lbs and boy do I feel great.  Whenever I get the craving for a piece of  cake or a hamburger or 3 I just grab the video and pump up instead.  Some  advice: Buy as many copies of this video as possible an put them all over  your kitchen.  Put them in the pantry, in the bread drawer, in the  fridge,...just everywhere.  This way when you want to eat you will see  Richard there smiling at you and saying ""get up off your duff and work  out and be beautiful"" ...you won't eat again.  Put one in the oven and  microwave as a second wave of defense just in case you actually do get the  food and attempt to cook it.

664495,5,6303471153,"This tape gets me up and going, and it's so much fun. The songs get stuck in my head all day long. I like the moves - it takes a while to learn some of them, but once you do they're not difficult, and I think there's a good  mixture of repetition and variance to not make the tape get too boring.  This is my favorite of the 3 Richard Simmons tapes I have (Disco Sweat,  Sweatin' to the Oldies 2, and Tone & Sweat), and I hope he makes a  Disco Sweat 2 soon (and if you do, Richard, can I be in it?). - Anne",920073600,,507,3.710280373831776

I have gone back to the older concept of exercise, such as music I have always loved, and a program that is fun, exciting, and easy to do.  Nothing to learn or remember, just follow the group of Richard's class, listen to music, and sweat if you want to or don't sweat if you don't want to.",1489622400,,421,3.988095238095238

I like the fact there is men and women of all shapes and sizes, not just pencil thin girls. And it doesn't take long to learn the routines. I also really enjoy working out with Richard Simmons, he is so upbeat and he just makes me want to be a better me. If you want a hard core routine this is not what you are looking for but if you want a routine that you can easily follow along to this is the one.

He's quirky, slightly weird, and totally unique.  He brought his own brand of caring to the weight-loss industry and connected with a lot of people.  If you're like me, you don't want to be trying to follow people who have reached and exceeded their weight loss goals while you're still trying to achieve yours.  On the video, Mr. Simmons always surrounds himself with people who are real and those who look like the rest of us.",1467849600,4,607,4.583333333333333

If I actually could learn the steps and do them before he changes the moves I think it would be fun.  In order to get into this routine, I would have to watch it for a few seconds then pause it, practice, go back to play for a few seconds, and pause it again to get the moves, etc.  I'm just not up to that.  When I want to exercise, I want to exercise the whole time.  The music is good however.  I want to do it.

However, I had to stop the DVD after 10 minutes and switch over to one of my tried and true ones (Jessica Smith and Leslie Sansone are my favorites).  The moves were not difficult at all, but there is little to no direction, a lack of buildup with the moves, and the choreography feels very chaotic (hard to follow).  This was very disappointing, as I was hoping for a really fun workout to include in my rotation.  Sorry, but I won't be attempting this a second time.",1457827200,2,583,4.321100917431193

I enjoy the encouragement that Richard Simmons gives in his workout videos and the music is pretty awesome! Plus I love that some of the people in his workout videos are not all stick thin and they all have unique shapes and body styles. I like the intro and then the dance off at the end where everyone dances down and they share who they are and how much weight they've lost.

Simmons doesn't give a lot of instruction, but it's pretty easy to follow along, and easier, I imagine, if you've had even the slightest hint of dance training. I definitely get a mild cardio workout from this (I'm in my 20's and in pretty good shape, so it's not exactly intense exercise for me), but it's a fun way to shake up my exercise routine.

I saw that the DVD is indeed available and sold from the same company and fulfilled through Amazon.

665183,5,6303471153,"I found this one fun.  Even though I'm not crazy about disco music, I enjoyed this workout.  It was fairly easy to learn, probably partially because he explains more in the later ""Sweatin'"" discs I've tried.  The disco music is pretty low-key and ""mainstream"", so it should be tolerable for most anyone who, like me, doesn't particularly like that genre of music.",1398470400,,363,4.82258064516129

665185,5,6303471153,"This a great video, but it is 72 minutes long. It is perfect for me because it gives a good workout, but it's not too high impact and it has some stomach crunches at the end for cool down time.",1398211200,,193,3.85

It is hard to follow the routines and the music I was expecting to be more actual Disco melodies by original artists.  I suppose if you watch it enough times (more than 50 in my opinion), you will get the knack of it and be able to follow along with Simmons but I would not have bought this if I had know there were no original artists in the songtrack of this DVD.

I do not do exercise classes as frankly, the people in spandex and slim bodies intimidate me.

Not only are the people in the background just like ""me"", (meaning not a size 0 with perfect hair and makeup - and no offense to size 0's out there), but they are working hard to lose, just like most who've bought this DVD.  Don't let the description of dancing,fun,etc., fool you.  It is a long video (at least approximately an hour of cardio) and at the end there are dozens and dozens (MANY!) of various abdominal exercises. While I've got a collection of other exercise videos, this is by far the most fun and the most effective. I almost forget how much actual work I'm putting my body through until I'm done. This video, without a doubt, helped me lose 50 lbs., along with watching my food intake.  The thing is, I would do this video and it made me feel so good about myself and what I'd already accomplished (did it in the AM), that I didn't want to ""blow"" my diet the rest of the day.  If you are a 60's child like me, like the disco music of the 70's, and like to dance, you'll love this video. It just made me want to keep dancing. Also, the results were fantastic!

I HIGHLY recommend the 3 mile express walk! I'm 33 and have lost 13 pounds so far with a healthy diet and the WATP video!",1380844800,,455,4.364705882352941

The workout starts with a short warm up song to get your heartbeat up, and then moves into a slower song for  some stretching before you really get to the sweating. There is one high intensity song that, believe it or not, was a little hard to keep up with on my first attempts. The other songs/segments are fast paced without being too overwhelming. Simmons also provides a decent amount of entertainment with his cooky personality, and also motivates the viewer with kind words. The workout is over an hour long, and it ends with a cool down number and floor work that is based on doing crunches for your abs.
The reason I'm giving it 4 stars is because some of the workouts have odd moves that don't seem very beneficial, and don't really go to the beat of the songs. Other than that, it's a great workout that is fun and not too hard.",1378684800,,1090,4.240384615384615

Well, after severe boredom from my other dvd's I bought a bunch of Richard Simmons dvds.  This one is my favorite.  It has great 70's music and is just plain FUN. It has some high intensity songs, too which is great for a mix. I don't stop and wonder how much longer is left in this one like I did with a very popular walking instructor (and I had a bunch of of hers).  There is not enough time for boredom. You are constantly doing something ""fun"".  It doesn't matter if you look silly, the point is moving!  It's my favorite out of about 8 of his dvds.",1368662400,,657,4.09375

I remember being happy the people featured in the workout were of all sizes and it really motivated me to continue.  Most workouts I had tried before had extremely buff people (which I found intimidating as I was just starting on my journey) or the workouts were too high impact. When I couldn't keep up or get it right, I was discouraged.

Richard may not be some people's style, but he always seems to say something encouraging just when you need to hear it and that keeps you going. Are the moves the most exciting in the world? No, but they are easy to learn, you'll get your heart rate up and after a few viewings, you'll have it down.  I also like that we are able to see the what the progress has been for the people who join him in the workout because aat the end of the dvd they list the names and pounds lost.  That was more motivation for me.

As my exercise needs changed over the years, I've added many other exercise systems,  but at least once a week I will still spend time with my old exercise friend Richard.",1367280000,,1114,4.197183098591549

I remembered this DVD from over 10 years ago ( when I was able to move a heck of a lot more) and knew that I would enjoy this enough to have me feeling good while not risking as much injury and still getting a decent workout.  It is not one of these ten minute intensive workouts that I have literally injured myself with.  This is about 45 mins of fun movement with some great music and "" Richard Simmons"" which means you are going to smile. In the end, you have some ab workout, it is a good amount, you are going to get to this point and realize that you are not just frollicking around!

It makes me feel so much more comfortable when I can workout with people who are normal rather than people who look like they workout for two hours everyday and don't eat anything but salads. It really is a great DVD and if you want something that can work for beginners and those who are fit choose this DVD.

Of all my Richard Simmons Videos it is my least favorite, it is the one I pull out when I have exhausted all the others and need a change so about once a month. The I will survive part is way overboard. I mute it because even though the dancing is great Richards speech is enough to make me want to scream so i dance in silence while he does his crusade. I do this for stress relief not to get more stressed out listening to someone screaming about survival.",1351296000,,595,3.966666666666667
665602,5,6303471153,"I first came across Disco Sweat while working with a special needs girl in Austin.  She was in a children's theatre program and loved to dance.  I found the VHS at Half Price books, and after doing it once, I thought ""omg Elizabeth would love this.""  So on a rainy day when we couldn't play outside to get all her energy out, I brought the tape with me.  Before I knew it, we were doing it together 2-3 times a week.  She LOVED ""I Will Survive.""

Then a few weeks ago, I was getting bored with the elliptical at the gym and wanted to do something entertaining.  So I ordered the DVD on Amazon, and fell in love with it all over again.  All my fit friends like Insanity and P90X, but I'm just not that type.  I really need to be encouraged as I go along, and no one does that like Richard.  At the point during ""Give It Up"" where I always get the most worn out (and where other people probably do too), he says, ""Just keep trying, that's all.""  I know it's just a video, but that positive reinforcement is uplifting every time I work out.

Another thing I like is that none of the other dancers (except that black guy with the muscly arms) were intimidatingly fit.  Normal people.  BBWs gettin' their freak on.  There are women that have to be at least 250 lbs, one might even be closer to 300, and they do all the moves seemingly effortlessly.  They may be overweight, but I bet they're in better cardiovascular health.  And Richard himself isn't some huge bulky guy or a beautiful woman in shorts and a sports bra.  When you get past the clothes, he looks pretty normal.  Look closely, though, and you'll see he's got some serious muscle.

In short, I love everything about this video.  I love that it's supposed to be 70s themed but you can tell it was from the 90s.  I love the lady in the DJ booth whose only job was to hold up the ""How are you feeling?"" sign.  And yeah, I like hearing that I'm a special creation.",1347321600,4,1919,4.225895316804408

I love the music and the dance moves on the dvd.  My favorite tunes are:  ""Boggie Fever"", ""You Make Me Feel Mighty Real"" and ""Born To Be Alive"".  Richard incorporates a standing toning segment and abdominal crunch routine.  I like the fact that he has a cool down at the end of the aerobic segment and one at the end of the adbdominal crunch routine.  If I decide not to do the crunches, I have cooled down enough at the end of the aerobics.  I usually complete the abdominal work because Richard is most encouraging in this segment.

In my opinion, Richard is a triple treat in all those aspects.

As far as this DVD routine goes, I haven't been able to get past level one yet; I've been in a bit of a health challenge for several months so for me and my somewhat limited abilities at the moment this is a serious workout. I rotate this with other exercise and I am looking forward to going further with Disco Sweat in the coming months.

The disco songs are fun and familiar. The moves aren't too hard to follow and if I get lost I just march in place for a moment to catch up. I found it easiest to watch one particular person in the crowd that was doing modifiers of the moves and to try to keep pace with him/her. This is nearly an hour long from start to finish so you can break it up into more manageable sections or do the whole thing if you're able to. Richard keeps the energy high by by giving positive shout outs to you the whole way.

If you like kitschy and over the top sparkle gym shorts on your fitness cheerleader you will LOVE this DVD.

The only way the class knows what to do is they've practiced it a million times.

I first stumbled across this videotape at my church's annual rummage sale and was intrigued. I knew Richard Simmons was a famous fitness trainer of the stars, but I wasn't sure I could handle his grueling exercise regimen. However, after seeing some of the featured tracks I knew I had to get it. Disco music is my specialty, and I love working out to those amazing tunes. (As a matter of fact, my membership at 24-Hour Fitness was once revoked when I snuck my Donna Summer LP into their sound system. Turns out records won't spin on the modern CD players, and management didn't like Donna Summer. Double oops!!)

Anyway, I've been ""sweatin"" to this VHS for over six weeks now and the results have been Disco-Tastic! I've dropped 12 pounds, and more importantly, I know all the lyrics to ""Boogie Wonderland""! I've been trying to learn that song for a long time. (The band members never obliged my requests for the complete lyrics.) I also learned how to point in the air like John Travolta, which I had always been too afraid to attempt - until now! I'd recommend this VHS tape to ANYBODY who wants to improve their figure and enjoy themselves at the same time.

CONS: Some of the moves too complicated/risky, not enough hits from KC and the Sunshine Band, controversial exercise shorts",1296691200,5,1473,4.75

There is basically no intro, no instructions or time allowed for you to get the steps down. I haven't done alot of workout videos, so that's why i figured I'd go w/ Richard Simmons'.
The DVD jumps right into a routine without any breakdown of the steps at all, so you don't even know what's coming next. I guess you're just supposed to flounder until you get them down. Also, the warm-up isn't until after the 1st routine which seemed a little off to me...
It did get me to work up a sweat, but It frustrated me more than anything since I could barely keep up with the routine changes.
You also need quite a bit of room to do the steps, so my living room was barely adequate. I'll try it again of course, but if you are uncoordinated and need something with step by step instructions, then this might not work for you.",1263600000,2,892,4.315476190476191

I was really disappointed.  I pictured myself dancing to some good disco.  I even checked out the songs in the photograph on Amazon.  Good songs.  Unfortunately, you can't hear them for all the yak-yak he makes.  I don't care for group videos, prefer personalized instruction  - should have realized.  All that notwithstanding, I could have lived with the video if it had made me sweat.  No challenge at all.  I'm not in that great of shape, but I can do much, much more than this.  Maybe for people who are seriously overweight and need a place to start, to get them motivated, this video would be perfect, but it didn't do anything for me.  The only thing about it that I would recommend is the abs section at the very end.  But that's just because my abs are so out of shape that I have no endurance.  They're just crunches, but they keep coming at you fast and furious.

He makes the routines fun and interesting and is so encouraging! Always telling you ""Don't give up! You can do it!"" And just when the routine becomes faster and more intense, he puts your fears to rest by telling you to 'just do the best you can!'. I have lost over 85 pounds in the last few months and I have done it with Richard's help! If you are like me, going to the gym and working out in front of tons of people does not sound like fun. I can do this in the comfort of my own home and let me tell you, it is quite a workout! What I have noticed with Richard's videos is that you can really do it at your own pace. The moves might seem easy, but if you really work and put a lot into it, it is an excellent form of exercise. I have had this DVD for weeks now and have only done the first 45 minutes! The entire DVD is around 75 minutes, so I am looking forward to more, new routines! The songs are great and you'll have them stuck in your head all day. And what I also love about this video is that there are REAL people behind Richard doing the moves with you! Not thin, skinny people, but real people who are struggling with weight just like we all are!

His exercise videos refreshingly include a wide cross-section of people w/ various ages, shapes, weights--a wonderful touch!

Here's why Richard Simmons aerobic tapes are the best available:

*  Imaginative choreography that is fun to do

*  A live band with talented singers reinterpret the hits (This is true of many but may not be true of all of them).

*  Real people doing the moves, some at high intensity and some at low intensity

*  Richard's understanding of the challenges of being overweight and getting in shape make his encouraging words meaninful and genuine.

*  If you love to dance, it hardly seems like exercise.

It takes a few viewings following along to get all the moves, but once you do, these tapes are very fun and effective.  The end section that shows how many pounds people have lost is very encouraging.

Richard has a high energy personality that is perfectly suited to lead aerobics and encourage people, however some people find this enthusiasm irritating.

666252,5,6303471153,"I had been looking at these DVDs for over a year, trying to decide if I wanted to buy one or not. And I am glad I did!

This one has 70s tunes, is set on a disco dance floor with a DJ in between tracks to tell you what the dance will be (warm up, high intenisty, low intensity), and is justplain fun!

- I like the way that the dancers are of a large range of size. Some are really rather big, some are quite thin. I also love the way that they are all good movers. The danccers all change places so you can see them all

- Richard does not really call the moves. The first 2-3 times you do it, are very VERY confusing, but that is ok. Because then you get it

- It is low impact (no jumping etc) which is great for those with knee troubles

- the workout is longer than a lot of the ones I own (45-50 min as opposed to 30min) but if you are short of time, just miss a song or three and fit it into the time you have

- for me, there is too much ""woo!""ing and the like. And I don't find Richards little comments inspiring. They do however, make me laugh, so I don't view them as a negative.

basically, I really liked this, and I ordered a few more, which I will hopefully enjoy just as much.",1203120000,5,1192,3.821138211382114

+Happy, entertaining vibe from Richard and everybody on the floor. They are really having fun and Richard is cheering us all on.
+These are REAL people on the screen--variety of races, male, female, big and small. No troops of leotarded twig-girls.
+Plenty of variety and more exercise than I can handle at the moment and I walk almost every day.
+Moves are easy to scale down or up, so you can keep the feet low or put 'em in the air a little higher if you are so darn fit!

Now I'm 23 and I've gotten fat and wanna lose weight so I decided to exercise again. Since I love dancing so much (I was a dancer in my skinny years lol) I tried those hip hop dance workouts but non can make me really SWEAT without aching my body! The moves are fun yet cheesy and looking at 'large' people dancing in the background energetically motivates me even more because if they can do, so can I! Unlike all other workout videos that I own, they have skinny dancers and I couldn't follow their hardcore workout when I'm fat and heavy.

Unfortunately I own the VHS version so the picture is grainy and looks like it was shot with a cheap camera, and sound is quite bad...but still bearable. I'm so happy there's a DVD version now.

Some people that complaints about Simmons not instructing the steps and such, chill. After you workout a few times, you'll get the steps and you won't even realize it. For me, I didn't have problems at all because I'm a dancer but even if I wasn't, it's still not that hard to follow because when you've 'mastered' the steps you wouldn't want to listen to Simmons instructing over and over again like you're a beginner. You just wanna keep grooving and sweating and just keep going!

666517,5,6303471153,"I always watch my exercise tapes/DVD's through first before I try them. I remember Richard from 'way back, but this was the first time I'd seen him in action in decades. Cute routines and happy, real-looking people just dancin' around and having fun. I just couldn't wait to give it a try myself.

When my husband got home that night, I asked, ""Remember disco?"" and he did the John Travolta pose and started grinnin'. ""Come on in here,"" I urged, and he joined me for a truly entertaining and energizing hour or so. We laughed and sweated and got some good exercise.

Yes, the songs are choreographed, but it is nothing that you will find impossible. No, I doubt if you will pick up the steps the first time through, but personally I would not want to do a routine that is that easy. There are some neat little moves here that neither of us was familiar with and which we will add to our repetoires.

I like that you can pick the individual songs you want from the DVD so you can practice. I did not find it at all annoying that Richard was singing along with the songs, as I was doing it, too. It was truly inspiring when the individual dancers were showcased and the amount of weight they had lost was revealed. Wow. Staying fit and healthy makes you feel like dancing.

I do have to agree with some of the other reviewers: the guy who introduced the songs seemed out of place and, at times, annoying. I didn't understand his purpose in the program. The crunches section also seemed like a bit of an afterthought, although they were, in and of themselves, a nice little toning routine.

When I found my OLD VHS version about a week ago I started working it again and was surprised that I remembered most of the moves. I think the wonderful thing about this workout is that there isn't a lot of talking and explaining during the routine. You just dance and have fun. I have videos where the instructor is blabing all the time and they stop to walk around and see what everyone else is doing. Richard gives encouragement, sings, & jokes but he never stops working with you. That's what I think makes a good workout. And to see so many other overweight no-names who are energized and excited just helps me be more determined to continue.

666688,5,6303471153,"This video is not for you if you don't like dancing, have no rhythym, or have two left feet, but if you DO like dancing, you will probably love this. True, Richard does very little to explain the moves to you, but I think that's a good thing because it means once you do get the hang of the moves, you don't have to sit through explanations as you watch the tape and can just get right in it. Also, the challenge of learning the routines was what got me hooked at first--I'd master one song, then go on to the next, and so on. All it takes is a little practice and repetition and once you've got it, it's lots of fun! None of the routines are too tricky. People of ALL shapes and sizes, including some very heavy people, are dancing away, which is encouraging.

This workout is long (if you do the whole video) and is guaranteed to work up a sweat if you are overweight and out of shape. But it's never so intense that you feel you just can't go on. Also, having the DVD divided into segments means you can choose to do the full video, or just a few of the routines, according to your needs. When I have time I do the whole thing start to finish, but on busier days I can just do 3 or 4 of my favorite routines and get a decent workout. The stretch routine at the very end is soothing and feels GREAT after the workout.

Anyway, I know some criticize this video for not doing enough to explain the moves, but I really don't find this to be a problem--if you like dancing and are coordinated you will catch on and enjoy yourself. I recommend this tape as a great motivational workout for anybody who likes dancing and disco music, and who needs to get fit.",1092441600,38,1655,4.1526479750778815

666819,1,6303471153,I ordered this video because I am a BIG woman and in dire need of exercise. It is impossible to try to keep up with this video. Definitely not for a beginner. No warm up and I have no idea how these women keep up. Waste of money.,1084233600,11,229,3.7916666666666665
666820,4,6303471153,"This video is fun. I had a great workout. I kind of added my own little tae-bo moves into the kicks and leg-raises  when I felt that it wasn't working me hard enough. I prefer the Blast and Tone, 80's  Blast off, and 60's Blast off over this one. Mainly because you work-out harder in a shorter amount of time.:) This video is a great one to have in your collection. The crunches are great.",1080950400,6,390,4.1866666666666665
666821,1,6303471153,"I'm amazed at the 4-1/2 stars for this video, as it was the worst of all I have bought.  Simmons doesn't tell what moves he's going to make, and only repeats them 2-3 times, so I was always playing catchup.  Meanwhile, he sings over the background music, ruining the one redeeming value!  The bizarre cinematography is often focused on one person's face, or knee, etc., so that the exercise isn't visible at all.  I much preferred the ""Crunch"" series, especially Cardio Salsa, which I purchased at K-Mart.  They explain the exercises, warn you when a change is coming, and I actually could follow along the first time.",1080345600,17,618,4.738317757009346
666822,5,6303471153,"I am not a real big fan of excercise.  I have to admit that ""Disco Sweat"" has made something I dread more fun.  I enjoy the music and Richard makes it fun.  One really does work up a sweat.  Even when the sweat is dripping off the body, one cannot stop the workout.  You just want to continue.",1056672000,19,293,3.9827586206896552
666823,4,6303471153,"This routine takes about 50 minutes, and that's 50 minutes of full-on, nonstop exercising. So don't fall into the trap of thinking that this is a piece of cake! It's a serious workout. But it is fun, fun, fun -- the songs are great, the dance steps are NOT difficult after the 2nd or 3rd try (and I'm a pure klutz), and Richard is funny and campy and utterly charming. It's hugely inspiring to see the other dancers, of all imaginable shapes and sizes moving through the routine; I especially loved the ending credits, where each one comes on and shares how much weight they've lost. Very motivating. Try this one, but be prepared, it's not for your light-workout days unless you're very fit. If you're a beginner or intermediate and want to give yourself a push, this is a fun way to do it!!",1053302400,186,792,4.468965517241379
666824,5,6303471153,"This is my first Richard Simmons workout.  I bought it figuring I'm either gonna love it or hate it. I was pleasantly surprised! There are so many things that I like about this workout!  I love the music, all the songs chosen are geared towards positive self-esteem and self-acceptance. Richard Simmons is friendly and encouraging, not overly-enthusiastic as I would have expected.  I liked that people of all sizes were working out, and everyone had wonderful energy! There are a lot of toning moves mixed in with the aerobics, which I wasn't expecting at all, such as plies for your legs and fly aways (I think that's what they're called) for your arms. Granted this workout isn't designed to give you a beach body, but it will give you basic muscle tone and improve your aerobic stamina.  All the moves are low-impact, but can easily be adjusted to higher impact for those who are in better shape.  This workout is a lot of fun and completely enjoyable!",1048204800,114,956,4.700598802395209
666825,5,6303471153,"Richard has done it again.  This workout is very good.  He keeps you motivated by telling you that you can do it and you will learn the steps.  The people don't all whoop and holler every second either which is nice.  A great workout, one of my favorite tapes!",1046131200,8,260,4.244897959183674
666975,5,6303471153,"I used this tape a few years ago and just recently found a copy of it again. It is fun enough to do over and over, even every day as I do. It is a trick to get used to the moves the first few times you do it, but once you get the hang of it it totally flows. Richard takes you through a series of highs and lows so that just when you feel you're about to break, he calms you down a bit; then by the next song you're on fire again and ready to kick it up! It is a long workout, and that too takes time to get used to, but as such it is very effective. Recommended to anyone who wants to lose weight, especially those of us who are VERY overweight and hate excercise!",1046044800,12,665,3.723404255319149
666976,5,6303471153,"What I like about Richard Simmons - and this video - is that he makes exercising more like fun than work.  I personally can't get very motivated by the ""work"" and ""feel the burn"" mantras.  Good for the moderately unfit.  Unlike Tae-Bo's basic workout, where I wanted to quit after 15 minutes, I can do this one all the way through!  Highly recommended.",1045008000,7,352,4.5396825396825395
666977,4,6303471153,"Okay, so the introductory videos like ""Sweating to the Oldies"" aren't cutting it for you anymore. You aren't sweating enough.  You need to move on up to a dvd or VCR tape like Disco Sweat. Are the moves easy? No. Will it take awhile to catch on? Of course. But you still can move along with the catchy music as you learn more complex steps. You will sweat. You will get conditioned. I have been working out since April and lost nearly 20 lbs. so far. I think the key is to vary your exercise, so try this tape a few days a week. The other days try something else (I suggested something by Gilard). I agree that Disco Sweat is a bit silly at times but it is worth the money. Good luck! As Richard says ""Just Do the Best You Can...""",1028246400,4,730,4.104895104895105
666978,5,6303471153,"This DVD was realy enjoyable and very effective for beginners/intermediates...I really did work up a sweat doing it! I didn't find the  choreography overwhelmingly complex-something anyone could pick up by the second time doing it. It would be nice to be able to check your heart rate (he just uses the exertion scale) but other than that,I thought it was great!",1027814400,7,362,4.934426229508197
666979,2,6303471153,"I did not like this tape.  First, I found the production quality to be inferior to other Richard tapes that I own.  The dancers whooping and hollering overshadowed the music.  That was particularly off putting to me.  The moves were more difficult to follow than in other Richard tapes.  I would suggest Richard's ""Sweatin' to the Oldies"" series rather than this tape.",1027296000,5,368,4.870967741935484
666980,5,6303471153,"I was never really into Richard Simmons, but I bought this tape because it had real songs on it instead of that bland electronic non-descript stuff that a lot of exercise videos use.  Now I love Richard Simmons!
Some of the moves are so cheesy (the classic John Travolta pose) that I was laughing too hard to continue for a second.  It's silly in parts, but that's what makes it so fun.
Most of the people in the video are REALLY large, which makes me feel like if they can do it, I can do it.  Everyone seems to be having a really fun time, and Richard is so encouraging.  He keeps me going when I'm getting tired.
It's also low impact (well, pretty much non impact), which is much easier on my feet and knees.  I found the moves pretty easy to catch on to.  This is a great tape if you're out of shape and just getting into an exercise routine like me.
Some reviewers talked about Richard not cueing on everything, but I like this better as after a couple times through the tape you pretty much know what to do, and you have to listen to it over and over again so you don't want someone saying go left, go right, over and over again.
I only do about 20 minutes of the tape at a time right now and plan on working up to more.  I will definitely buy more Richard Simmons tapes after having such a good experience with this one.",1019347200,10,1327,4.1400778210116735
666981,2,6303471153,I BOUGHT THIS EXERCISE TAPE BECAUSE I LIKE DISCO MUSIC.  I FOUND THE MOVES HARD TO FOLLOW DUE TO LACK REPITIOUS INSTRUCTION OF RICHARD SIMMONS.  HE WOULD JUST GO INTO THE MOVES WITHOUT MUCH PRACTICE.  I HAVE TRIED IT THREEE TIMES AND I FEEL IT WAS A WASTE OF MY MONEY.  I DIDN'T BUY IT TO LEARN DANCE.,1016150400,7,301,4.137931034482759
666982,5,6303471153,"I own many exercise videos and I have to say, Disco Sweat is one my favorites. In this video Richard really gets you motivated and gets you moving! The movements are easy to follow and Richard guides you through the video every step of the way. One thing I really like is the way they alternate high and low intensity intervals. The music is great and really makes you want to get up and dance! If you're looking for a workout that's fun yet challenging then this is the one for you!",978566400,3,483,4.260869565217392
666983,2,6303471153,"I'm very happy that Disco Sweat has helped a lot of people. I'm glad that some of you are able to use this and get a good workout and feel good about yourself. I bought this video in hopes of finding the same thing, but unfortunately found this exercise video to be (sorry for the harsh word) trash. First of all, when I first popped this video in, I thought I was watching an adult movie! It has a very home-made production to it. The sound is awful. The music sounds like it is coming out of a boombox backstage. But most of all, Richard does not instruct us as to WHAT he is doing. He just does his own moves and we have to watch and try to imitate. He changes the moves so often that I get lost and don't know where he is going or what he is doing! I can fumble around my house making up dance moves for free.
The thing I loved about this video is that it DOES have people of all sizes doing the exercises with Richard. They're not all beautiful models. I'd like to see that in more videos.
End thoughts: poor production, poor sound quality, poor exercise technique instructions, hard to follow. Sorry but this did not work at all for me.",978566400,4,1142,4.148648648648648
666984,4,6303471153,"I've used several of Richard's videos and this is by far my favorite. The music is fun and easy to dance to, and the video does a good job of alternating high and low intensity intervals. It took awhile to catch onto all the moves, but once you've done the tape a few times, it's a breeze. Richard is a little cheesy and always includes a dance with some goofy ""acting"" moves, but at the same time he is very encouraging and motivating. I'm convinced that he was upset with some of the people in the video because he goes a little overboard with the crunches at the end of the tape, but once I had done it a few times, they became easier. I've been using the tape for two weeks, combined with changing my eating habits, and I've already lost 10 pounds! Give it a try! It's really a lot of fun!",975196800,2,793,4.1558441558441555

7848777,5,6303471153,"Always loved Richard Simmons tapes, or CD's.  They're a great work out for loosing weight and keeping in tone.  I started out with Sweating to the Oldie's back in my 40's. I'm now 72 and still doing them. Really like Disco Sweat because of the floor work out. I have, I think every tape he ever made. Richard always give verbal support which I love, saying ""you can do it, I knew you can"", and when you finally get there, you can't help yelling out ""Yea Richard, I did it"" thank you thank you. He's fun to workout with.  Also I like, he shows all type of people do his exercises from fit to definitely overweight, which helps you get the attitude, if he/she can do it -- then I can. The first 2 weeks are the hardest. But!  Every morning I got up an hour earlier, and made myself do the workout. By the second week I was looking forward to it, and found I had more energy and a better attitude.",1523750400,,894,4.1502890173410405

It took me a few times to learn the moves, but once I did, fughet about it! lol - and I like that I can adjust my own movements as to how I'm feeling, so sometimes, I do the movements lightly if I'm sore or feeling under the weather, but most times, I'm giving it my all!
