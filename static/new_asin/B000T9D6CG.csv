2895212,5,B000T9D6CG,"I fell in LOVE with Yellowstone in the winter,by watching this video. I first saw it on PBS, I was totally enthralled with the snow, the cold, the scenery,the wildlife...everything about Yellowstone in the winter is amazing! It's truly breathtaking!!
You cannot watch this video and NOT want to go there in the winter! I know I want to go...ASAP!
I recommend it - if you love beautiful scenery, wildlife, national parks and it is a just a peaceful & fabulous place to visit",1258934400,2,473,4.642857142857143
2895213,5,B000T9D6CG,"I Xcountry skied Yellowstone for a week in 2002. It is an amazing place to be. Imagine an icy night as Old Faithful steams to light of the full moon, elk crossing your path on a wooded trail, moose off into the deep woods and buffalo, coyote, swans on the river... Not many people are as privilaged to see this amazing treasure and when I saw this video I got to see it again. It was sold out and back ordered the first time Nature put it out, so I kept it on my list and bought it when it was available. Christmas in Yellowstone will fill you with wonder and make you want to protect this amazing place.",1242172800,7,604,4.084033613445378

2895217,4,B000T9D6CG,"""Christmas in Yellowstone"" captures the beauty of the quiet time at America's first national park.  While Yellowstone receives more than 3 million visitors annually, few brave the elements when the temperature drops to single digits - or worse.  Few, that is, except for the residents of the park.

Here you'll see how some of the animals who live here deal with winter - whether it is a red fox hunting in the snow, the eternal battle between wolves and elk, buffalo getting a steam bath, or a mother grizzly hibernating in her den, this program gives an inside look into their various coping strategies.

Also interspersed throughout the program is a mini-profile of nature photographer Tom Murphy, who is shown here working and camping out overnight in the park.  Yes, in the dead of winter!  Seeing the windy conditions when night fell, I'm probably not the only one who said ""better him than me...""

Four stars.  From the mountain chickadee to the grizzly, this was a captivating look at Yellowstone in winter and the creatures who call it home.",1195862400,25,1050,4.826815642458101
2895218,4,B000T9D6CG,"would have ""loved it"" if not for little advertisement halfway through the film, ....won't be buying another pbs nature video.",1434758400,,125,5.3
2895219,4,B000T9D6CG,"If you have ever been to Yellowstone, you will long to go back.  If you watch this video, you will want to go at Christmastime.  However, I would not recommend sleeping outdoors in a lean-to!!",1423785600,,192,4.457142857142857

2895225,5,B000T9D6CG,"Finally a beautiful view of nature with no ""private"" activity and no camera people hinting at hunting while filming to the point that animals almost need to oblige them. Look forward to giving it as a Christmas gift to ""family.""  A balanced and delightful film of nature and the living things that reside there.  The cat watched the entire video without moving because it was peaceful and good.",1410652800,,394,4.779411764705882
2895226,5,B000T9D6CG,"Who wouldn't like to traipse through Yellowstone in the winter and see all these splendors in reality?  Linda Hunt's fabulous narration adds so much to this beautiful film.  And Mother Nature does the rest.  A must watch for those of us who reside in the southwest where there is no snow, or frolicking fox and otters to watch,",1403913600,,327,4.603448275862069
2895227,5,B000T9D6CG,I love this Nature show. The photography is outstanding. Love the naration. A glimpse into Yellowstone in middle of frozen winter. Loved the history facet of John Colter,1401408000,,169,5.071428571428571

2895240,5,B000T9D6CG,"This is visually the most stunning dvd I've ever purchased. It can be viewed (and loved) by all ages. The scenery and video-tography was 'art' quality, and the music and sparse narrative mesmerizing. We watched it over and over through the holiday, and it will be a beautiful, centering - almost spiritual offering to be shared for many Christmases to come.  Thank you for all who worked on this beautiful film.",1390176000,,411,4.788732394366197

2895246,5,B000T9D6CG,"I watched this every time it came on TV--I finally decided I wanted my own copy to enjoy again and again. A beautiful film, with great narration by Linda Hunt. The segment with the photographer out in the backcountry on snowshoes, and spending the night in the snow was awesome! Highly recommended for outdoorspeople and nature lovers alike.",1357603200,,341,4.896551724137931

2895258,5,B000T9D6CG,"I had watched this on cable tv more than once, and recorded it the last time - kept the recording for almost a year.  Decided that if I could find it for sale as a DVD I would buy it.

2895260,4,B000T9D6CG,"I did like this tape, but it's not the one I had seen on the PBS Nature show several years ago.  It is shorter, but is nicely done and narrated.  The one I was looking for showed more close ups of the animals in the coldest stretches of winter, like the bison with those big snow beards and real slow music that showed how everything slows down in winter.  But, I still would recommend this tape.",1331251200,,396,4.184210526315789
2895261,5,B000T9D6CG,A great video! Living not far from Yellowstone I've visited the Park many times in the summer but this video presented a whole new world to me.,1329609600,,143,4.333333333333333
2895262,5,B000T9D6CG,We have enjoyed watching this video of Yellowstone National Park.  The presentation both informationally and pictorially are very well done.,1325116800,,140,6.0
2895263,5,B000T9D6CG,This was recommended to me by a gal who has never been to Yellowstone but has ejoyed watching this several times.  My husband and I traveled to Yellowstone last year so I gave it to him for Christmas.  Everyone enjoys watching it.  It focuses on the Park in winter with many scenic views and the wild animals that live there.  Don't worry about Bambi getting eaten by a wolf as none of that kind of food chain action occurs.,1299974400,3,424,4.329113924050633
2895264,4,B000T9D6CG,"I had purchased this along with Yellow Stone Wolves, and it has the entire Christmas in Yellowstone on it, so I purchased this one for nothing, Was very disappointed that this was recommended as there should have been some kind of flag stating that the other DVD has both on it. And since I opened both I am stuck with it, so even if you don't like wolves now get the other DVD for the monies worth",1293753600,5,398,4.181818181818182
2895265,4,B000T9D6CG,This is a truly beautiful video that really captures the atmosphere of Yellowstone in winter.  It is shot in various parts of the park and shows different animal residents of the park in winter.  The narration is almost like poetry.,1266278400,2,232,4.775
2895266,5,B000T9D6CG,"The Christmas in Yellowstone DVD was everything that your listing stated.  It came before Christmas.  Thanks for your immediate shipping.  The DVD was excellent in every aspect, story, filming, music, narration.  I am thoroughly enjoying it.  I've visited Yellowstone in the summer; so the DVD took on more meaning to me.

Thanks for your attention.",1264032000,,349,5.254545454545455
2895267,5,B000T9D6CG,"""Christmas in Yellowstone"" is a one-hour documentary about the Yellowstone national park in Wyoming. It contains great footage of otters, elk, bison, wolves, coyotes, swans and a very inquisitive fox. We also meet nature lovers, people who celebrate Christmas at a hotel in the national park, and a photographer who insists on crossing Yellowstone on skis in the middle of the winter. The movie ends with a hibernating grizzly, almost sinisterly waiting to wake up from its slumber.

Frankly, there is very little action in this documentary. The wolves do try to attack elk and bison, but fail both times. The coyote comes looking for a wounded otter, but never finds him. And the bear, as mentioned, is hibernating...

Still, ""Christmas in Yellowstone"" is worth watching. It's a meditation more than a documentary. It wants to convey the atmosphere of the place, rather than bombard the viewer with a lot of information. I think it succeeds eminently well. Besides, most of us have seen enough action packed documentaries about wildlife already. I was pleasantly surprised when the wolves failed in their quest to attack the bison, or when the coyote never managed to find food. Most other documentary film makers would probably insist on including the usual hunts and killing sprees. It was also quite entertaining that the only ""dangerous"" animal was a perfectly ordinary fox, which ran right at the nature photographer Tom Murphy!

If you want an authentic look at a wintery Yellowstone, ""Christmas in Yellowstone"" is perfect. But if you absolutely want to see a lion attacking a wildebeest for the nth time, you might want to check out something else...",1261699200,9,1658,5.043795620437956
