4099369,5,B0039YAL6M,"In spite of its understated title and cover - MUHAMMAD & LARRY is really an essential insider's look at the tragedy and twilight of Boxing's most charismatic greats Muhammad Ali...as well as one of its least loved champions, Larry Holmes.  This is a landmark film for anyone who is an Ali fan or who has followed his career.  The documentary is also for Larry Holmes fans as well - because it reveals a side of both men that most have never seen and most take for granted - namely that Ali was just a great fighter and Holmes was the workmanlike champion.

Almost everyone looks back at Ali's last defeats and just think that he got old.  As this documentary points out, the truth was much more insidious.  Ali was damaged goods and those close to him had an inkling of his deterioration.  But in spite of being Angelo Dundee, etc - as it goes in boxing, the lure of money is too good to resist.  Everyone around Ali needed their paycheck - but this film is not about that.

What make this film work is the tremendous archive of Ali and Holmes training at the time.  Like When We Were Kings - the cameras were close and spent much time with the two, and catches intimate, candid comments by both men.  Interestingly, the oft-maligned Holmes ends up having the last word of this film, and proves to be surprisingly eloquent and likeable.  We wish Ali would've had something to say, but he vanishes quietly without a trace.  I would've made the ending stronger, but in spite of this, Muhammad and Larry is a must-watch film for any boxing fan.",1293321600,,1541,4.464285714285714

8392521,5,B0039YAL6M,"While the subject of ESPN Films 30 for 30: Muhammad & Larry is  the 1980 championship fight between Larry Holmes and Muhammad Ali, that is not the primary focus of the film.  Instead, the film is a study in contrasts between two of the greatest heavyweights to have ever stepped into the ring.  In fact, the only thing Holmes and Ali seemed to have in common is that they were both genuinely nice guys who also happened to be tremendous fighters in their primes.

The majority of the film is spent showing the months leading up to the fight.  Ali's training sessions are filled with onlookers laughing at Ali's jokes and cheering his every move.  Ali spends time hamming it up with spectators, performing magic tricks for children and posing for pictures with devoted fans.  He also gets in the occasional sparring session (if you want to call moving slowly around the ring while absorbing blow after blow from his partner sparring).  Ali has difficulty even working the speed and heavy bags.  He struggles to put any sort of combination together during any of his workouts only landing the occasional slow jab or weak body blow.  Ali's skills are in evident decline here and these sessions serve as a harbinger for what lies ahead when he steps in the ring to face Holmes.

Speaking of Holmes, his training sessions could not be more different than Ali's.  He trains in a small gym with only a few onlookers.  Holmes is shown to be an Adonis in his prime, and every punch he throws during his sparring sessions sounds like a club hitting a mattress.  Holmes also appears quiet and introverted compared to Ali's bluster and braggadocio.  He appears almost embarrassed to be involved in the fight at all given Ali's condition.  He is faced with the ultimate no-win scenario here: refuse to fight and tarnish his lagacy as the guy who ran from the Champ, or fight and beat the tar out of (and possibly kill) an old man who has no business being in the ring anymore.  You feel for Holmes when he recounts how fans reviled him for thrashing their beloved Ali.

The retired Holmes and Ali share as little in common now as they did then.  Holmes is largely forgotten (running a small gym in his hometown) and living a modest but comfortable life.  He has his mental faculties intact and seems content except for bitterness about never gaining the recognition he deserved.  But hey, at least he can drive himself around town.  Ali, on the other hand, is possibly the most famous man in the world and certainly immensely wealthy as a result.  It's hard to tell how much of his brain is still working, though.  He speaks in slow mumbles and is barely able to walk.  His play boxing sessions with fans are painful to watch.  It's like watching a zombie attempt to fight.  His fame and legacy are indelible, but the viewer is left wondering which of these men has won in the match of life.",1308614400,,2878,4.581213307240705
8392522,3,B0039YAL6M,"This is the 4th film released in the ESPN series 30 (stories) for 30 (years, 1979-2009).  This is a good film, telling the sad story of the last hurrah of the ""Greatest"", Muhammad Ali.  While a good film, it could have been so much better (3 of 5 stars) had it addressed the central issues of the fight between Ali and Holmes.  Essentially, the film brings together a collage of interviews and film clips that led to the build-up of the Ali-Holmes 1980 fight.  Interspersed are interviews with the central characters from the present, namely, Dr. Ferdie Pacheco, Angelo Dundee, Larry Holmes, and Holmes's wife, Diane. Only Dr. Pacheco addresses the central issue of this film: why was a spent and ill Ali allowed to fight the champion Holmes?  Pacheco addresses this issue, but in my view, he does not express it strongly enough.  This fight should have never taken place - period.

The film quickly reviews how the (mis)match developed through brief clips of Ali regaining the championship for the then record third time against Leon Spinks (9/1978), followed by his retirement. Ali had lost the title to Spinks seven months earlier, a travesty in itself, as Leon Spinks was an Olympic boxing champion (1976) who only had 7 professional fights.  Ali announced his retirement from boxing, and in order to crown a new champion, Larry Holmes and Kenny Norton fought for the title the same year, with Holmes pulling out a win in a magnificent fight.  Ali was restless and bored in retirement, and like all former champions, the lure of the spotlight, the cheering fans, and of course, BIG money, inexorably led him back to challenge Holmes for the championship.  In Ali's case, the film makes it clear he already needed the money, just two short years into retirement.  Eight million dollars for Ali (two million for Holmes) was too much to resist.  The fight was signed, but before Ali was allowed to fight, the Nevada State Athletic Commission insisted Ali had to pass a neurological exam at the Mayo Clinic.  At the time the results of the exam were not made public, but clearly, deficits were present in Ali's neurological system, apparently not enough to call off the fight, and too early to call it Parkinson's Syndrome. The film clips leading up to the fight clearly show an unenergetic Ali, slow of foot, slurred speech, a remarkably placid Ali, with the beginnings of the deadpan facial mask so characteristic to those with Parkinson's.  Ali was clearly in the early stages of a neurological disease, and it was evident to everyone around him.  Yet, only one person, Dr. Ferdie Pacheco, Ali's personal physician, had the fortitude to declare that the fight should not take place.  Pacheco had resigned as Ali's physician several years earlier, as he saw the physical decline in Ali's skills and refused to be a part of any more fights that would damage the man he loved.  Ali's trainer, Angelo Dundee, who had been with Ali since the early 1960's, is interviewed in the film, and as his manager, Dundee did nothing to prevent the horrible physical beating that his friend was to endure.  He unfortunately went along with the charade that Ali was a worthy opponent for Holmes, when in fact; he knew the opposite was true.  Dundee declines responsibility for the beating, stating he could not stop Ali even if he resigned as his manager.  Let's be  frank, as much as I'd like to give Dundee a pass on this matter, clearly, he knew Ali was severely compromised, knew he did not belong in the ring with Holmes, and yet allowed the fight to continue 10 brutal rounds until Ali was brutally and helplessly beaten.  In my opinion, Dundee in good conscience should have not signed on to the massacre he knew was going to happen, and at the very least should have stopped the fight early on to prevent the beating Ali endured.  But Dundee did not stop the fight until signaled to do so by Ali's spiritual manager, Herbert Muhammad, who controlled everything Ali did.  Herbert Muhammad pulled all the strings in the background (much like the man behind the black curtain in ""The Wizard of Oz""), and he needed Ali for the money Ali brought him.  I also take fault with referee Richard Greene, who had the responsibility to stop the fight once he saw Ali was helpless against Holmes.  Holmes indicated to Greene throughout the fight to stop it, as Ali was defenseless, but Greene inexplicably did nothing.  There is plenty of blame to go around, and Ali himself is to blame as well, but his handlers certainly should have prevented this fight from happening and did nothing.  They were complicit in the slaughter.

Holmes emerges in this film presentation as a man still haunted by the legend of Ali.  Holmes was a great champion in his own right, he dominated the heavyweight division from 1978 - 1985, but even so, as a man now in his mature years, he still seeks the acclaim he feels was denied to him by the legend of Ali.  Holmes is certainly one of the most successful heavyweight champions ever, having invested his earnings intelligently and prudently, yet, clearly, despite his comfortable life, he comes off bitter that he was not recognized by the boxing establishment for the true champion he was.

This 30 for 30 film is certainly gives us in the 21st century a glimpse back in time to the close of the Ali legend, but unfortunately, in my view, the film does not take to task the Ali entourage that allowed this travesty to take place.  Just as the fans sat in stunned silence during the beating of Ali by Holmes, so too, his handlers were also silent in preventing this match from taking place.  Ali deserved better from the people who loved him.

What makes this film so fascinating: we know what Cassius Clay was like as a young fighter - erstwhile King of the World (as captured in David Remnick's classic&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/King-of-the-World-Muhammad-Ali-and-the-Rise-of-an-American-Hero/dp/0375702296/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">King of the World: Muhammad Ali and the Rise of an American Hero</a>), fists a blur and mind razor-sharp.  And we know all too well what life has become for the Muhammad Ali of today.  But what was Ali like in the middle?  Answer: Watch this film.  It absolutely catches Ali at the point at which life begins to turn for him.  You take note throughout of the slowness of his speech and action.  That's brought home forcefully by a interview with Angelo Dundee in which Dundee recounts urging Ali not to do the Larry Holmes fight, telling Ali that his speech and movement are slowing down.  He makes his case plaintively: You don't need this.

Of course, Ali (being Ali) didn't listen.  His reward: a savage beating at the hands of Holmes, a fighter then at the peak of his powers.  Who can forget the SI cover that following week with a beaten, swollen, battered Ali slumped in his corner?  It has stuck in my mind indelibly for 30 years.

The Maysles brothers' film also captures the vibrant personality of Larry Holmes both then and now.  Always in the shadow of Ali during his career, Holmes emerges in this film as the anti-Ali: a gladiator living his post-ring days with his intellect and impish love for life firmly intact.",1294876800,,3570,8.186046511627907
