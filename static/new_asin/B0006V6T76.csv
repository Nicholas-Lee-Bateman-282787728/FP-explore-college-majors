8043540,5,B0006V6T76,"I was a little suprised when I watched this DVD. I saw the true beginning of the whole series and a definite change in the mood of the whole story. This was the turning point, the DVD that revealed all the secrets of the coordinators and the true intentions of Zaft. This is where the whole war began, the truth behind the scenes. The Gundam series is a truely thoughtful and excelent series. This is the DVD that tells all and is a good start to wrapping up the series. Gundam Seed is a true masterpiece.",1115510400,4,505,4.270833333333333
8043541,5,B0006V6T76,"Truly one of the best Gundam series so far and this dvd is proof of that, full of action, drama, suspense, etc... As the curtain is about to fall on the series the tone has certainly changed for all the series and the characters themselves. This is one dvd worth the purchase allthough i obviously recommend buying vol 1-8 so you can understand to its fullest and now why people herald it as one of the greatest gundam series.",1111449600,2,426,4.405063291139241
