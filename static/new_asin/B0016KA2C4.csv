3157487,2,B0016KA2C4,This NIA tape did not provide the workout experience I hoped for.  Too many beating drums and rapid pounding rhythms.  I prefer the soothing music with constant motion.,1298937600,10,168,4.964285714285714
3157488,5,B0016KA2C4,"I normally would never use the word joy and exercise in the same sentence, but with Nia, that is not true. Nia makes exercise effortless and fun.",1287360000,17,145,4.407407407407407
3157489,5,B0016KA2C4,"NIA is an awesome way to exercise.  I was looking for exercise that was more like dance, joy and having fun.  I was introduced to this technique through a NIA Jam event at my church.  How wonderful men and women alike can enjoy this exercise, and those of all ages, you just adapt each movement to what you body can do now.  The movements are not rigid as in body building, the movements are flowing and awakens the spirit and the heart.  You begin to love your body no matter what shape.  As you do the movements you are in JOY and LOVE flowing with the movements.  You won't go wrong getting into this exercise technique.",1274659200,14,623,4.318965517241379
3157490,4,B0016KA2C4,The Nia workout is a great workout!  I am a runner who completes 16 to 20 miles a week. The Nia workout is a great cross training workout for me.  It has benefited the parts of the body running does not hit.  I enjoy the work out very much and look forward to more Nia workouts.,1274227200,11,278,3.9285714285714284
3157491,5,B0016KA2C4,"NIA Unplugged is an amazing DVD...I hesitate to label it a fitness workout because it is really a mind, body, soul session.  Although, don't get me wrong...you will sweat!  I am the person who disliked aerobics and working out in a group session but NIA has changed all of that for me.  I have become quite addicted to my NIA classes in Portland, Maine to the point that I am buying NIA dance tapes to do at home as well.  NIA will take you away and you'll forget your worries and problems while you laugh, dance, and feel very sassy at the same time:) Go for it...take the challenge and transform your life while moving your body in ways you never thought possible!

3157492,5,B0016KA2C4,"Nia was new to me when i began classes a few months ago.  Nia is a fun way to exercise.  A combination of Yoga, martial arts and dance you can make it as intense or relaxed as you like.  The basic movements are easy to pick up.  This DVD is fun to watch and difficult not to join in with.  The drumming keeps the rhythm easy to follow.  The Rosas are obviously fit and flexible and look as though they are enjoying their routine.  As do the people behind them.  The movements are easy and you have time to learn them before moving on to the next move.",1260230400,31,551,4.037037037037037
3157493,5,B0016KA2C4,"Well this is by far the best ""fitness"" dvd I own, it changes completely my way of doing sport, believe me i tried many program fitness...",1244160000,10,137,4.3076923076923075

3157495,2,B0016KA2C4,I don't really feel like a get a solid workout - even if I do the whole hour-long program. It is just too new-agey and free form for me. I'm not a dancer so this just doesn't have enough structure for me.,1389398400,3,204,3.880952380952381
3157496,5,B0016KA2C4,"I wasn't sure what to expect from the Nia Unplugged DVD, after only seeing a few short videos on it online. I have some Zumba DVDs, which I love, but Nia is awesome in a different way. I love the freedom in the Nia movements. You never feel as though you're doing something wrong.  Though there are moments in the DVD where I feel like Goldie Hawn in the movie Housesitter (the aerobics scene,) for the most part it's an extremely non-judgmental work out.  Love the percussion in this DVD. Having just the extremely talented drummer providing music, really keeps you focused on the dance aspect of Nia.

The only thing I should mention is that you have to get past some of the more over-the-top moves by a few of the Nia dancers, as it does make you think at first that this is too ""new agey"" and corny to be taken seriously.  After a few times, you really tune them out, and enjoy the experience without the distraction.  It's definitely a calorie-burner, and probably best for someone is has been fairly active recently.  The nice thing is that you can always modify it if you're not feeling quite up to the whole DVD and all of the moves. Because Nia is more free-form, you can easily modify.",1358726400,4,1195,4.433789954337899
3157497,5,B0016KA2C4,I love the nia workouts!!  The body flows with the music and it is an exercise in listening to the body and letting it direct you.  The music of this dvd is a bit primitive and it is so easy to move to.  The warm up and cool down leave you well relaxed and feeling good - also feeling like you have had a good workout.  I find this workout easy to come back to.,1328227200,,361,3.7733333333333334
3157498,5,B0016KA2C4,"This is a liberating and effective workout. Not your typical exercise dvd, you become part of the ""class"" and just follow along. I found the drums motivating and the movements full of variety. I worked to my own capabilities, and the options really allow you to approach your own limits. I work out early in the morning, well before the roosters get up, and it's fun to pour my heart and soul into a dance experience that nobody will see, but that will benefit my body and mind.",1323648000,5,478,4.443181818181818

3157500,5,B0016KA2C4,"I had never done a Nia class before getting this DVD and i haven't been very active lately, but I was able to do this whole routine on the first try and I'm no spring chicken.  It's not like exercise at all but more like tribal dancing with some martial arts, tai chi, and cha cha thrown in.  All of the muscle groups get a good woorkout, including good stretches, and a lovely cool down with a short meditation at the end.  Not once do you get down on the floor and thats okay with me.  My body was SO sore the next day so big thumbs up!  I love the drumming in the background and the softer flutes at the end.  It is packaged in an unsealed paperboard folder.  I contacted Nia to see if this was how it was packaged because I didn't want to support bootleggers, and they confirmed the packaging.

3157502,5,B0016KA2C4,"My daughter and I have several exercise dvd's to do our daily cardio.  Nia is a enjoyable different exercise.  You mirror the dancers.  It is relaxing yet stimulating.  Anyone can do it.  The dancers are young and old, fat and skinny, men and women.  You don't feel intimated by a skinny white drill instructor who can bend her body into positions you will never obtain.  The music of drums is great.  The dancers are wearing different clothes and seem to be having a great time.  It is a terrific video.",1315699200,4,504,4.511111111111111

I can't believe that something that is so much fun and creative can be such a good workout.  They've got the arm movements, the squats, the lunges, the kicks, and what's more--for me these workouts lift my mood when I'm feeling down.  The great thing is that I don't feel like I'm exercising, I'm just enjoying myself.",1311724800,7,480,4.3

8262899,4,B0016KA2C4,"I'm assuming this is one of the very first DVDs from Nia because it's so unlike the other two (Santana & Opal) I have. I'm not saying it's not good but it's definitely different! It's all drums and really a very good workout but it doesn't feature Debbie's voice-overs which I've come to enjoy. And the workout itself is done with the viewer mirroring Debbie and Carlos instead of watching Debbie from the back and in the mirror. For this reason, I was confused! Could just be me but I prefer the later DVDs' approach to leading the workouts.

I'm not sure if the older DVDs are being retired. I haven't heard back from Nia's office regarding this and I'm hoping when I do, I'll get the answer I'm looking for. I would LOVE to buy Cadence and Aya for certain. If anyone has either of these and would like to sell one or both to me, please let me know at catzenjammers at hotmail dot com.",1424649600,,887,4.311377245508982
