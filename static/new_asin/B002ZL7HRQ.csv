8649454,5,B002ZL7HRQ,"Fun fun fun! Loveable characters and an enlightening story for everyone in the family. Brilliantly combined puppetry with live action performances makes this a fun movie to watch. The film is based upon one of the live shows at Martin's Fantasy Island Amusement Park on Grand Island, NY.
Spend a night with your kids and watch this movie... satisfaction guaranteed!",1262995200,2,365,5.1
8649455,5,B002ZL7HRQ,Having enjoyed the Fairy Tale Theater show at Martin's Fantasy Island for the past few years-it was a joy for my children and myself to be able to bring a part of it home with us.  The characters are unique and the combination of puppets with people was very different.  My 2 boys have watched the movie so many times I may need to order another copy.  The acting is very good and the fact that is was all done using Green Screen makes it even more impressive.  Very enjoyable  for kids (and adults) of all ages. I highly recommend the movie.,1260057600,3,542,4.2745098039215685
