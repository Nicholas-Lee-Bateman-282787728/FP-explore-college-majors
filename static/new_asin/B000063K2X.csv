7959603,4,B000063K2X,"Ignore the naysayers that call this dvd ""disappointing"". It was very funny and while it is rare and high priced now, I strongly recommend picking this one up if you can find it in the $10-15 range. It isn't worth more than that,however.",1135036800,7,236,4.511627906976744
7959604,4,B000063K2X,"My son and I really enjoyed this DVD.  It's full of bizarre plays and bloopers. We had a good laugh over some of them and the ""rewind"" of the DVD player was put to good use.

However, I was a little sad that it didn't present marvelous or incredible defensive performances.

I hope MLB will in the future come up with a DVD with the incredible wizardry of Ozzie Smith, Fred Lynn or Brooks Robinson.",1116028800,,398,4.28
7959605,3,B000063K2X,"We've worn out an old ""This Week in Baseball"" bloopers tape from about twelve years ago. This ""ultimate collection"" is not as good as that single 45 minute special.

There's quite a bit of filler material. The ""characters of the game"" segments are pretty lame and too long. And some of the best bloopers of all time are missing. I remember one off the earlier tape in which a foul ball turned on the sprinklers - it was screamingly funny, but is not to be found here.

It's not terrible. Bloopers can't help being funny, and there are some good ones. But you need to really like bloopers to pay this price. Total run time is only 90 minutes, and, as I said, there's some filler even in that.",1097712000,3,691,4.348837209302325
