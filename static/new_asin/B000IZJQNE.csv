There are so many crimes that can be punished outside the prison walls and save the American tax payers and the Federal Gov. all the money that it cost for people behind bars. A friend of mine was incarcerated for over 3 yrs. because he refused to pay the IRS because of all the money they were spending for their own pleasures. My friend has a doctorate and owned a  treatment center for 11 yrs. for addicts.  He witnessed many people loose their homes, businesses etc. which made him very angry. He could have continued to work and pay the IRS back as he is currently doing.  SO WHY MUST I ASK WAS IT NECESSARY TO INCARCERATE HIM. On another note there is absolutely NO REHABILITATION.
People are labelled as Felons and can't rent apartments, get jobs etc. when they are released. Therefore forcing alot of them to go back to what they know best just to make money to live.  Something has to be done about alot of the crimes that can be punished outside the prison walls.
THANKYOU Diane Sawyer for reporting on this subject matter.",1425081600,,1187,4.553990610328638
