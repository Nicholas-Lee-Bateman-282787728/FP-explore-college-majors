2162325,1,B00062IZLI,Poor audio quality and very poor picture quality. Some scenes in dark settings are barely visible at all. It looks as though someone simply recorded a broadcast of this program on their TV and then transferred the home recording from VHS to DVD.,1483920000,,245,4.72093023255814

2162340,2,B00062IZLI,I did not like it - I ordered it for my 3 year old grandson and it was just too old and dark.  I was unhappy.  He had no interest.,1479168000,,130,3.3
2162341,5,B00062IZLI,I loved it.  Just as strange and surreal as I wanted a live action version to be.,1478736000,,81,3.764705882352941

2162384,2,B00062IZLI,Just an OK version of this classic with low budget special effects that are so out dated. Prefer to watch Tim Burton's version which blows this film away on all accounts!,1466208000,,170,4.516129032258065

2162388,3,B00062IZLI,There were some parts that were really well done and easily understood. In other parts the dialogue did not come across as clearly. It is as if I need to watch and listen again to catch it all.,1465689600,,193,4.105263157894737

2162407,4,B00062IZLI,"This is one of the best screen treatments of Alice in Wonderland ever. It has a very impressive cast and tells the story very well. Unfortunately, the many DVDs available tend to have dull, washed-out color.
  The great thing about this streaming version is that the colors are bright and strong. It's good to see Wonderland's true colors.",1464393600,,339,4.827586206896552

2162424,5,B00062IZLI,"This is the only film version to get Lewis Carroll's  masterpiece right. Disney's  animated version from the 1950s is nothing like the book, and now they're new version directed by Tim Burton  is even further from the book. If you want to see a movie that gets Lewis Carroll's story correct, see ""Alice's Adventures in Wonderland"", the 1973 British film adaptation  of Lewis Carroll's literary masterpiece. Even the characters and costumes are made to look like John Tenniel's original illustrations.  The only deviation from the book is a few songs that were added but they are great, and the lyrics totally support what's going on in the story.",1463097600,,646,4.944444444444445
2162425,2,B00062IZLI,It's was not cartoon but pretty accurate movie,1462752000,,46,4.875

2162441,2,B00062IZLI,"Seriously creepy 1970s version of the classic, complete with weird music, hokey costumes, dated special effects and positively sepulchral pacing. If you enjoyed the recent Disney version with Wiaskowsa and Depp, this will have you sleeping in under 2 minutes.",1462406400,,259,5.5
2162442,3,B00062IZLI,I absolutely hate this weird movie.  But my 3 year old daughter loves it,1462406400,,72,4.142857142857143

2162444,1,B00062IZLI,Old.. Low quality,1462233600,,17,5.0
2162445,1,B00062IZLI,"miserable waste of your time. I suppose this might have been entertaining in 1972...perhaps if you were smoking something (??). I like how they advertise Peter Sellers and Dudley Moore's name when they in fact have rather small parts. Other than that, very droll dialogue in a movie that was very obviously shot on a sound stage. (you won't be wowed by any special effects or costumes here)",1462147200,,390,4.75
2162446,1,B00062IZLI,Given the fact that I have seen the newest version and anticipating the upcoming version to hit theaters.. I can't mentally bring myself to watch this version. It was too slow.,1462147200,,176,4.709677419354839
2162447,4,B00062IZLI,Old fashioned film making with strong art direction - with a bit more musical aspirations than most Alice versions,1461628800,,114,5.052631578947368
2162448,3,B00062IZLI,It was ok. Just way too much singing.,1461456000,,37,3.75

2162450,5,B00062IZLI,"A classic, very well done! It is still as enjoyable as when I first saw it! It is from 1972 and our children and I enjoyed it together in the 80's. It is a mellow version as those days would have it and not too old to be bored with it!  Try it, you will see what I mean!",1461024000,,270,3.5762711864406778

2162463,1,B00062IZLI,This movie was creepy. My 8-year-old shut it off.,1461024000,,49,4.555555555555555
2162464,5,B00062IZLI,Best adaptation of the novel that I've seen so far. It actually sticks to the book rather than picking and choosing scenes from Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass and mixing it all together.,1459382400,,205,4.722222222222222

2162513,2,B00062IZLI,"Does not compare to its double, the ""American"" version directed by Harry Harris starring Natalie Gregory. It may have great actors but their cameos don't help a film that crawls or songs that aren't catchy.  The ""American"" vsn., the one I grew up with,  not only keep things moving at a clip with big stars from both sides of the pond, but the songs range from short reprises to full songs, ballads or production dance numbers, that can stand on their own.

If anyone finds this film remotely interesting or entertaining, I strongly recommend the Harry Harris version and its sequel Alice Through the Looking Glass.",1455667200,,615,4.783018867924528
2162514,1,B00062IZLI,"I read the reviews, and thought this would be an enjoyable version of Alice in Wonderland.  I stuck it out as long as I could, and then just stopped watching it about half-way through (I think).

2162718,3,B00062IZLI,"I'll leave the story & artistic reviews to the others who have covered it nicely. This is a review of the different DVD releases known to me as of 2014.

THE (OK) VERSION: ""SCREEN MEDIA"" February 16, 2010. Cover has a green illustration of a blonde Alice, from behind, walking into the woods (funny, since the movie's Alice, the book's Alice and the real life Alice Pleasance Liddell were chestnut-haired! Blame Disney!). Current Amazon price (new) $5 or (used) $2.

With ""Screen Media"" being the most recent release I assumed it would be the best quality. WRONG! This is simply a re-packaging of Screen Media's earlier release, this time released to coincide & cash in on the mega budget Johnny Depp film that came out in 2010. This DVD is so bare bones it doesn't even have a menu, and the minute the movie & credits are over, it kicks you out of the disc and back to your DVD player's home screen haha.

The Screen Media quality? Sound is a little sketchy, but passable. Picture quality is decent--a slight picture improvement over some earler releases--but it's still 4:3, cropped on the left & right, pan & scan. The pan & scan isn't as bad as you might expect; I only noticed it being obvious (abrupt) in a few spots. The real distraction is the full frame cropping. This is one of those movies whose lavish sets and magnificent props absolutely scream for widescreen, and I can only imagine how it must've looked in theaters when the print was fresh. The original was shot in Todd-AO 2:35 which must've been just spectacular.

Alas, almost all the DVD versions are cropped down to 4:3, and I don't know of any legal Region 1 (USA/Canada) versions that are widescreen. So if you're a regular schmoe with a regular Region 1 player and too stupid to hack it region-free like me, then this is, I guess, the version to get.

#1 BEST VERSION: ORACLE ENTERTAINMENT Region 2 (Europe). The cover shows a grey scene of Alice sitting in a long underground corridor looking at the white rabbit. Amazon price (new) $99 or (used) $41. No, that's not a typo. Can you believe it?

The Oracle version is supposedly widescreen letterboxed (NOT anamorphic, meaning it won't fill your widescreen tv unless you zoom in). If you're a borderline psychotic Alice fan then, sure, it may be worth the price tag. But me, I'm holding out for a Blu-ray in the next few years, so I'll remain begrudgingly quiet with my version above.

#2 ACME-TV VERSION: Possibly a bootleg, was sold by an ebay user ""acme-tv"" who was banned. Price unknown. If you can find one of these floating around, they're supposedly almost as good as the Oracle in terms of picture, sound slightly superior, region free.

#3 SCREEN MEDIA (the one I bought, see above)

#4 PLATINUM DISC Don't even bother. This version is marginally better than a 40 year old VHS.

My advice is to go with Screen Media for now. And kick & scream like bloody hell for someone to digitally remaster this classic film on Blu-ray. Good luck!",1400198400,,2969,4.616698292220113

2162740,3,B00062IZLI,"The production as a whole comes across as song-y and dance-y, with rather flea-bitten costumes for the non-human characters.

On the very minus side, though, it wipes away almost all of that attentive mind of a child, baffled and fearful of the grownup world, knowing at the same time that she must find her place in it.

2162744,4,B00062IZLI,"Although it's hard to justify the 33 versions of ""Alice in Wonderland"" that are out there, this one no doubt deserves preserving.  It an all-star British cast with costumes, choreography, and acting that are played close to the book as I remember it (from some 60 years ago).  The songs and film score, moreover, are by the revered John Barry (whose lush, romantic orchestrations are admittedly excessively florid and overblown, even for a Victorian dreamscape).

The primary problem is the inferior resolution of the image which, though very likely deemed ""acceptable"" 15 years ago, has in the age of digital all but disqualified the film from satisfying any one but the more studious spectator.  As an adult who can play whatever role the author/narrator/film director requires of him, I'm able to measure the visual and sonic images against those still residing in my imagination from a half century ago. Consequently, the film works reasonably well for me--with the moments of whimsy, fear, fascination, curiosity, and grotesquerie (e.g the baby's transformation into a pig) capable of arousing within my adult-child spectator's mind the director's intended effect.

For the more sophisticated and younger viewer, this one would best be passed up until a master-print falls into the hands of someone with the means to restore it.",1365552000,,1333,5.210280373831775

The fact that the film is still in active DVD circulation in English, French, Spanish, Greek and Hungarian after all these years is most satisfying for me in my late years.",1354665600,,512,5.333333333333333
2162773,4,B00062IZLI,"My only grip with Alice's Adventures In Wonderland is that the actress Fiona Fullerton looks too mature for her age.  The writers should have decided on somebody who's younger looking, however this is understandable given the time period- back in the early 70's it seems Hollywood writers always went with the girls who looked mature for their age.  Nowadays this wouldn't happen.

As for the movie, well it's really confusing but in a delightfully adventurous kind of way.  I really don't know who these highly unusual animal costume characters are that Alice meets along the way but they offer really good, hummable theatrical-type music so I don't mind.  I guess technically this *is* considered a musical, even though it's more like a musical combined with a play-like adventure through the woods for innocent Alice.  There's a song that plays about 23-minutes into the film with lyrics about Mary and Mabel that's *really* awesome.  I like the exchange of vocals between Alice and the uh, rabbit-headed guy, hehe.  It's true that the things in the background such as the trees, mushrooms, fences, and grass look really dated.  I don't really care though- this is 1972 after all.

Sometimes I wonder if this film is trying to copy the Wizard of Oz as far as a young girl stumbling upon unusual characters and looking for a specific destination/answers.  The similarities are there on several occasions.  I also wonder if all the drug references that I've been reading about are true.  For example, Fiona's character eating one side of a mushroom to make her short, and the other side would make her tall.  Hmmmm..., haha!

I guess another minor complaint is how the Alice character just immediately FALLS into this world of weirdness right away with very little in the way of building up to it.  I believe the current Alice In Wonderland movies correct this problem.  I also don't understand how people who are able to follow this movie are supposed to be smart enough to become scientists and mathematicians.  What?  In what way?  Overall, a nice little adventure for children.",1354406400,,2082,4.911174785100287

*To be sure, there are a couple of parts left out and a few things added, but (for example) the Tweedle Brothers often show up in Wonderland (although they should be part of Looking Glass), and they were very good here.
*Many of the human characters look exactly like the Tenniel drawings, and the rest (including Alice)--as well as the animals--very closely resemble them.  The animal costumes were not spectacular, but they worked well enough (especially for the level costuming technology available in the early 70s) and the movements of the ears on the White Rabbit and March Hare were perfect.
*The sets were very rich and detailed (what could be seen of them), and the direction and choreography were high quality.
*The sound was fine once past the credits, and the performances were very well enunciated.

2162776,5,B00062IZLI,"This is one in a series of reviews that will eventually be posted for every Alice in Wonderland title available on Amazon. When the Tim Burton rendition of AIW with Johnny Depp was due out in 2010 I thought it might be a good time to go back and watch the benchmark Walt Disney production from 1951, which I saw -or assumed I saw- as a child. It was a chance to get reacquainted with the many varied characters from the story as sort of a warm up for the Burton film. Upon viewing the Disney classic I was astonished to realize that I had likely never seen more than a few clips (at most) of that beautifully rendered Alice in Wonderland. So much seemed brand new. Nor did I have a memory of ever seeing any other ""Alice"" production. Then I realized that I had never read the book! Wait a minute. Where then did my memory of the Alice story come from? The curiosity sparked by that question ultimately led me over the next two years to accumulate every version of Alice in Wonderland still in existence. Well over 40 by the way!

This general commentary continues over in the review sections for both the 1951 AIW production from Walt Disney (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Alice-in-Wonderland-Masterpiece-Edition/dp/B0000TG9E2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Alice in Wonderland (Masterpiece Edition)</a>) and the 2010 production starring Johnny Depp (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Alice-in-Wonderland/dp/B001HN694K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Alice in Wonderland</a>). As these are the two most well known Alice's, rather then attempt to add yet-another-review for those two films, it seemed like it might be a more fun use of the provided space to muse a bit on the popularity and remarkable longevity of the story spawned by Lewis Carroll in 1865, as well as to share with you a bit of what I picked up while watching these 40 or so renderings of Alice in Wonderland. All other Alice productions listed by Amazon have a specific review for that title.

Review of this 1972 version...
This is flat out one of the best ""straight-forward"" tellings of the Alice in Wonderland story. I've been viewing the Alice movies available on Amazon in chronological order, and the entry viewed before this one was a TV production of ""Through the Looking Glass..."" showcased as a musical (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Alice-Through-the-Looking-Glass/dp/B0031REQH2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Alice Through the Looking Glass</a>). Yecch. What a relief it was to replace the memories of that eyesore with this quality production.

This is one of the few ""Alice"" movies named after the actual title of the book, ""Alice's Adventures in Wonderland"". The accurate titling is a harbinger of what's to come, as this production is steadfast in sticking to the actual dialog of the book. I kept pausing the movie and looking up the matching passage in the book, finding it quite accurate, the dialog often corresponding to the text of the book word-for-word.

Having said that, even this film does not include every one of Alice's encounters. So far I've yet to see a production with the pigeon and the egg segment, and this film is no exception. Also, the writers couldn't help but to throw in the Tweedledee / Tweedledum passage from Carroll's sequel.

But this movie works. Sixteen year old Fiona Fullerton steps up to play a great Alice. She can sing, she can dance, and she may well be the prettiest Alice to date. She can also act, emoting genuine reactions to her fantastical environment. The best part; she looked like she was actually having fun interacting with the creatures of Wonderland.

The film has one of those rare openings that portrays ""our"" Alice as the actual Alice Liddell that inspired Lewis Carroll to write down the story he made up for the Liddell girls on a boat ride down the River Thames. The movie opens on that fateful boat ride.

The special effects are also worth noting. They are not at all ""in your face"" like so many digital effects of today. When Alice grows and shrinks it simply looks like she is REALLY growing and shrinking. They also did a nice effect on the hall of doors that gives the impression the hallway stretches to infinitely.

The movie is filled with famous actors. Unlike some films where the ""famous actors"" sort of showboat their way around the set, these fine artisans disappeared so far into their respective characters as to be mostly unrecognizable. Worth noting is Peter Sellers making a return visit after playing the King of Hearts in the B&W 1966 British version with Anne-Marie Mallik. This time Sellers is deep undercover of makeup as the March Hare. Next to him most of the time is Dudley Moore playing the Dormouse. They play off each other very nicely. Then there is Ralph Richardson playing the caterpillar. This is a part that requires just the right actor and Richardson doesn't disappoint (he would go on to play God in `The Time Bandits' a few years later and nail that role too). Perhaps a lesser known actor to some, Michael Hordern, plays the Mock Turtle. This particular sequence is a must view, as the Turtle, the Gryphon and Alice dance it up in an unforgettable way.

The croquet sequence is good too. It's always interesting to see what kind of job they do dressing the King and Queen of Hearts. Here too a great job was done costuming all the players.

So, at this point in history, 1972, I think we have one of the best contemporary, live action, straight tellings of the Alice in Wonderland book, which is highly viewable for adults and kids. This is one for the collection. (and yes, the movie is not in good shape. This is one Alice movie really worth restoring!)

2162799,5,B00062IZLI,"A lovely, teenaged Fiona Fullerton, of wistful countenance, but with expressive eyes that light up beautifully at mirthful moments, has the title role in this 1972 retelling of Lewis Carroll's classic tale.
 Directed by William Sterling, and scored by John Barry, the latter of whom was at the height of his popularity at the time, it's soft cinematography style is typical of movies of that era.
 It begins on a serene day as Alice and her sisters, Edith(Pippa Vickers) and Lorina(Victoria Shallard) are being rowed on an English lake by Lewis Carroll(Michael Jayston, who had co-starred with Fullerton in ""Nicholas and Alexandra"" a year earlier) and his friend, Duckworth(Hywel Bennett). In his sharp, precise, and very distinct diction,  Carroll begins to narrate the tale of Alice, and draws their attention to a White Rabbit (played with diffidance, distraction, and excellent comic timing by Michael Crawford, who would later don another white half-mask as ""The Phantom of the Opera"") scurrying down a hole.
 Soon the adventure begins as a curious (and curiouser) Alice finds herself falling down the hole, chasing after the White Rabbit, and  encountering a bevy of strange characters along the way, including a Mouse(Davy Kaye) a Dodo(William Ellis), Guinea Pig Pat(Freddie Earlle), Bill the Lizard(Julian Chagrin), a second Guinea Pig(Mike Elles), a Caterpillar( Ralph Richardson) who invites her to eat a growth- altering mushroom, Tweedledum and Tweedledee(Freddie and Frank Cox), Fish and Frog Footmen(Peter O'Farrell, Peter Trigger), a Duchess( Peter Bull)with a baby that will turn into a pig, an irate cook who makes a mess and uses too much pepper(Patsy Rowlands), and a grinning Cheshire Cat( Roy Kinnear).
  Stumbling upon a mad tea party, she encounters a Mad Hatter(Robert Helpmann, in a role that is a far cry from that of the intimidating child catcher in ""Chitty Chitty Bang Bang""), who gets some of the most outrageously funny lines in the film, Peter Sellers' March Hare( a role which really put him in his element), and Dudley Moore's Doormouse.
 Disenchanted after that encounter Alice travels on to meet the 2,5, and 7 of Spades(Dennis Waterman, Ray Brooks, and Richard Warwick), and the King and Queen of Hearts themselves(a hostile Flora Robson contrasting sharply with a mild and amiable Dennis Price).
 After a seaside frolic with a Mock Turtle(Michael Hordern), and Spike Milligan's nasal sounding Gryphon, Alice attends the trial of the Knave of Hearts(Rodney Bewes), who is on trial for the theft of the Queen's tarts-- trial presided over by an Eagle( Ray Edwards),with a Monkey, Squirrel, Lory, Magpie, Frog, and a Duck(Stanley Bates, Melita Manger, Angela Morgan, June Kidd, Michael Reardon, and Brian Tripping respectively) serving as jurors.
 Frequently aggravated by the lack of logic displayed by those around her, Alice's outspokeness earns their ire, and while they call for the decapitation of their  young guest, who in every sense of the term has outgrown them,  the ordeal ends mercifully and quickly enough, and soon Alice's world is serene again.
 Viewers may feel enchanted by this retelling of Carroll's tale of logic, in which  a young girl holds her own in an uncertain world,and discovers herself to be bigger than her adversaries.--A 1970s take of an 1865 story that can still be relevent in the present tense.",1334188800,,3366,5.197781885397412

2162806,1,B00062IZLI,"Alice in Wonderland has probably been turned into movies more than any other children's book.  Every decade sees at least one version made for TV and one theatrical production.  This version was a made-for-TV musical, and includes a cast full of famous actors and actresses.  But this does not help, as the movie falls flat on numerous counts.

For a TV special made in the early 1970's, the set design, visual effects, and costume design are lackluster and needs improvement.  For example, Tweedledee and Tweedledum look like they are wearing fat suits.  The mushrooms, trees, and other set pieces clearly look like plastic molding.  Even the falling leaves in the outdoor scenes fall straight down like they were made of plastic instead of being real leaves that drift to and fro in the air.

The acting also needs improvement.  The character of Alice looks and talks like an adult woman, which totally defeats the essence of the story.  And her acting is so contrived.  For example, when she falls down the hole into wonderland, she does not seem worried at all, and instead gives the viewer a commentary of her thoughts and apprehensions.  The cheshire cat has no personality, and the mad hatter does not seem any more crazy than anyone else in this movie.  All in all, a horrible movie.",1269043200,,1291,4.787330316742081
2162817,4,B00062IZLI,"Fiona Fullerton is surrounded by a gallery of British character actors in this 1972  musical film adaptation of ""Alice's Adventures In Wonderland.""  Yes, I will add my voice to the chorus of Amazon customers who rightfully say that the quality of the picture and sound on the DVD release leave much to be desired. The picture on this Screen Media release is clearer than my old VHS copy. Still, this version deserves a quality restoration. Having said that, having this ""Alice"" on DVD is better than not having it at all; and my review will now focus on the film itself:
  This version begins on that famous Summer's day in the 1860's when Charles Dodgson/Lewis Carroll (Michael Jayston)  took Alice, Lorina, and Edith Liddell on a boat ride on the river. As he begins to tell the story we now know as ""Alice In Wonderland"", Alice falls asleep. Suddenly, the very real river-bank she  was resting on is replaced by an environment of over-sized flowers. Thus, the fantasy begins shortly before Alice falls down the large rabbit-hole. By including this perfect preface scene with Charles Dodgson, director/screenwriter William Sterling clearly shows that his intention is to be faithful to the original book. For the most part, he is successful. Other film-makers have failed to recognize that, while Alice's adventures are a pointed satire on Victorian society, the point of the book is really to have no point at all. Therefore, they force Alice must learn a lesson or, as in the case of Tim Burton's disappointing 2010 film (which disregards Lewis Carroll almost completely) she must go on a life-saving mission. Sterling, on the other hand, is smartly content to let Alice's adventures be whatever they are; or whatever the viewer wants them to be.  The film features appropriately surreal/theatrical sets. The tone of the film, like the book, alternates between being whimsical and weird, and murky and nightmarish. Nearly every chapter from the book is included; with the addition of the popular characters  Tweedledee and Tweedledum (Frank and Freddie Cox) from the 1872 sequel ""Through The Looking-Glass"". The film runs 95 minutes, but still drags in spots. The scenes involving the Duchess (Peter Bull) and the Gryphon and The Mock Turtle (Spike Mulligan and Michael Horden) could, and should, have easily been omitted.
  Fifteen year old Fiona Fullerton makes Alice genuinely curious, and she more than holds her own on screen in a large cast that includes Michael Crawford (""Hello!, Dolly!"", ""Barnum,""  ""The Phantom Of The Opera""), Ralph Richardson (""Long Day's Journey Into Night""), Robert Helpmann (""The Red Shoes,"" ""Chitty-Chitty Bang Bang""), Peter Sellers (""Lolita,"" ""The Pink Panther""), Dudley Moore (""10"", ""Arthur"", ""Santa Claus: The Movie"") and Flora Robson (""Fire Over England,"" ""Wuthering Heights"").
The songs by John Barry and Don Black (including ""Curiouser And Curiouser"", ""You've Got To Know When"", ""The Last Word Is Mine"", and ""The Pun Song"") may not find favor with all viewers, but they are completely in keeping with Carroll's whimsical word-play in the book. In the ""Curiouser and Curiouser"" department, the DVD cover picture shows Alice, seen from behind, as a womanly blonde. In the movie, Fiona Fullerton's Alice is a teen-age brunette. The DVD has NO extras, interactive menus, or booklet.",1268179200,,3320,5.14100185528757

I thought I was watching someone's videotape as filmed through a webcam!  It's THAT bad!  VHS videotapes look much better than this.  Not only is the resolution less than standard VHS, the movie appears to have been transferred from a second-generation VHS copy that suffered water damage; lots of video noise, flashes, uncountable noise artifacts, you name it.  It is unfathomable to me that a company could pass this off to the public and actually ask money for it.  The movie is good, but this DVD is terrible!  Stay away from the ""Screen Media"" release of this DVD!

JUNE 2010 UPDATE

I recently re-purchased this movie through Amazon.co.uk.  Though I must warn potential buyers of this new ""Oracle Home Entertainment"" March 2010 release that this version is a Region 2 PAL DVD and will not play in most U.S. DVD players.  (However, there are several work-arounds to overcome this limitation for those who are video savvy.)

The image quality, as well as the sound, are tremendously superior to the old Screen Media release!  Furthermore, the Oracle release is the original 2.35:1 aspect ratio -- not full-screen pan & scan.  However (and to my disappointment), this new widescreen release is NOT anamorphic, but rather, 1.33:1 letterbox widescreen.  Still, the image quality is so much nicer that even when magnifying the picture to fill a 16x9 television, it's far, far superior to the Screen Media version and now a real pleasure to watch.

If there will ever be an anamorphic widescreen and clean release of this film, I don't know...but I'll continue to hold out hope.",1266192000,,1925,5.0
2162821,5,B00062IZLI,"You can tell from the scene of a beautiful rowboat, on an english country stream, with Micheal Jayston (of Casino Royale, and Tinker, Tailor, Solder Spy fame) and Hywel Bennett (also of Tinker,Tailor) commandeared by 3 beautiful young ladies on a beautiful summer day. It becomes dreamlike.  John Barry's score is enchanting and strange and dreamlike as well.  The songs are short and never drag, but add to the mood, like something you might humm for a minute from a musical as you remember some scene or somebody you love.  The sets are JUST RIGHT for the book and very much faithfull to the books original.  Enchanting.  And with greats of english cinema like Flora Robson, Roy Kinnear (remember ""Help"" and ""I should have been in Vivisection""), Dudley Moore (10, Cook and Moore), Peter Sellers (pink panther,The goons show, Henry Orient), Micheal Hordern, Spike Milligan (The Goons Show, The Three musketeers), Peter Bull (captain of the Louisa in African Queen) on and on.
  Fiona Fullerton is very beautiful and sings very well and feelingly.  But I would say that what dominates is an english sense of the absurd and love of puzzles and John Barry's score.
  I bought 3 versions (sad I know) of USA released DVD's and they were are garbage.  I liked them in a way because the 4x3 blurry representation kind of felt dreamlike in a way.  But when I bought the UK released widescreen version which is fairly clean and does show the very widescreen film version I was quit happy.  Well the $100 USD DVD player I just bought at Walmart if very basic (cannot remember where it was on two DVD's and fails to talk to the TV without prodding) it does play all regions and so plays this (I thought I would only play on my laptop) at 720p (upscaled).
  This version will fade before the 2010 release, but will come back in 3 years to crush it into non-existance.  Why is a story book still so good for children and adults? Because it has been perfected over 6000 years.  Do you know what a doormouse is?  It is large like a small squirrel. It has a long bushy tail. It has large eyes for night and you see it sleeping in the eves in Europe.  But you cannot know.  Why is CGI awful, because it is perfect for 13 year old boys and men who have minds that cannot grow further.  I work with computers but I do not want them telling me stories.
  Great sense of the material, great actors, enchanting music, intelligence will win over cartoons every time.",1266105600,,2445,4.531963470319635
2162822,3,B00062IZLI,"So far, this is my favorite version of Alice on film. Why? The answer is simple: it stuck to basics. Rather than change up the story, it stuck mainly to the story in the classic book by Lewis Carroll. Okay, instead of Alice and her sister together on an outing, they have Carroll and his friend Duckworth taking the three Liddell sisters boating, and the Cheshire Cat's scene was dropped (though a publicity photo suggests it was filmed), and the Tweedles appear, the only nod this movie makes to ""Through The Looking-Glass."" Overall, these changes are forgivable.

Peppered with little ditties and songs, this movie feels like it should be a family classic. It boasts many stars, and there is even plenty of humor in the script, and you'd find yourself hard pressed not to chuckle at some of the Mad Hatter and March Hare's wisecracks. (""Who walks like this? ... I do!"") Some may be unimpressed by the idea of the Wonderland characters as just people in costumes, but really, prior to CG and advanced animatronics, how else could it be done? And considering Alice's adventure is just a dream, it looks appropriate that she views these odd creatures to be similar to herself.

This is an obscure film, but I feel a large problem lies in how it is viewed today: on home video. In the United States, all copies are horribly cropped (or in the case of the credits, stretched) fullscreen that look very dirty, the sound also being terrible.

The best home video edition is available only in the UK, and that still leaves a lot to be desired: while it is in widescreen and does look clearer, it is not anamorphic, but ""matted,"" meaning the black bars at the top and bottom of the screen are part of the video, and the transfer is not a sharp image, in fact, some parts of the image often look pixelated and there's some flickering going on.

Seriously, this should get a High-Definition transfer so people can enjoy it without being distracted by poor image quality.",1265155200,,1961,4.626436781609195

James Bond soundtrack musician John Barry wrote an excellent score, and Fiona's singing compliments it well, adapting the nonsense rhymes of Lewis Carroll to music. I much prefer these older versions to the modern remakes.

2162826,5,B00062IZLI,"I feel some of the other reviews here are unjust and over exagerated. There were two places in the film that in total lasted maybe about five minutes where the sound was distorted, but not badly since you could still understand the characters clearly (ex. one area had a warpy vhs noise and the second had a bit of low static). The costumes were well selected, but I felt a better job could have been done on the rats and the lizard (you can see a gap where the costume ends on his face). This version follows the book well, though it left out a favorite qoute about the taste of the liquid in the first scene that she drinks from the ""drink me"" bottle. I also felt that the British accents in the movie enhanced the film. I recomend this to fans and people who aren't overly critical of films.",1173484800,,794,4.264900662251655

As another reviewer mentioned, the DVD itself is unimpressive - the chapters are, as near as I could tell, either random or simply timed, without regard to content. If this production is a familiar favorite from your childhood, it may be worth something (unless the DVD transfer is as disappointing as it seemed to me); if you're looking for something new, look elsewhere.",1166572800,,785,4.737226277372263

That said, this DVD transfer is basically UNWATCHABLE. It's not clear what source they used for the transfer, but there are TERRIBLE audio pitch problems throughout the movie, with wow and flutter horribly apparent. This is particularly problematic for a movie like this with a significant orchestral and vocal score. If you have any sense of pitch, you'll find yourself pulling your hair out listening to the off-key strings! The video quality is pretty horrible, as well--worse than standard cable.

Unfortunately, the audio track is terrible. The is by far the worst audio track on any DVD I have purchased to date.

In spite of this, the songs and choreography are first-rate. This is not a musical, but a significant part of the story is expressed through song and sometimes dance.

Most notable in this production are:
(1) Dudley Moore, whom you will probably not recognize as the Doormouse;
(2) the Mad Tea Party, which is very well done;
(3) the songs and dance with the Gryphon and Mock Turtle, which are very, very well done;
(4) and, best of all, the song between the White Rabbit and Alice, ""The Last Word Is Mine,"" where he mistakes Alice for Maryanne, Mabel and a number of other girls.

2162842,5,B00062IZLI,"ALICE'S ADVENTURES IN WONDERLAND is a lush and lavish musical version of Lewis Carroll's book, with a haunting score by John Barry.  The cast reads like a Who's Who of British acting talent.

Alice herself is played by a teenage Fiona Fullerton, a charming musical theatre performer, who gives the role a spirit and wonderment which is perfect for the character.  Michael Crawford plays the White Rabbit, with other key roles  filled by Sir Robert Helpmann as the Mad Hatter, Peter Sellers as the March Hare, Dudley Moore as the Dormouse and Dame Flora Robson as the Queen of Hearts.

The score is quite haunting, in particular Alice's ""Curioser and Curioser"" and the final number ""The Me I Never Knew"".  John Barry's score has become quite admired over the years, and copies of the original soundtrack LP have been known to fetch large sums of money.

If you can, try to see the film in it's original Todd-AO/Super Panavision 70 proportions.  My DVD is presented in the original aspect ratio (though lacks 16:9 enhancement).

The previous editions were VERY shoddy - yet the film is so great that even those were watchable despite the fading colors and graininess. This new (2005) edition has had the colors brought back which really is nice. The graininess could still use some work though and it would be REALLY WONDERFUL if a major studio would buy the rights to this film and do a proper restoration. There is also music and an important scene that were cut from this film - two songs never made it to the theatrical release and one scene where Alice meets the Cheshire cat in the tree was cut before the original release - a very curious thing to do as that was a very popular scene in the book! It would be great if the next DVD release of this film could have a proper restoration AND ALSO include some special features. Many of the actors in this film went on to become major stars (ex - Michael Crawford of Phantom fame) Special features could include the deleted scene if it still exists and the original soundtrack recording as well as some interviews with the stars - like what has been done for Chitty Chitty Bang Bang and Willy Wonka.  Don't expect any special features on this edition - there aren't any -- more surprisingly there is NO MENU at all - Bare bones, but still a classic and important film for Alice lovers - much more reminiscent of Lewis Carrols books and characters than the Disney film!",1107648000,,1497,4.47985347985348
2162845,4,B00062IZLI,"This is one of the absolute best musical film versions of the classic tale.  Fiona Fullerton's Alice is delightful and believable and very true to the Alice envisioned by Lewis Carrol. The sets are beautifully done and are truly reminiscent of John Tenniels original illustrations. The adaptation does pull in Tweedle Dee and Dum - originally from the ""looking Glass"" sequel - and it rather curiously does away with the Cheshire Cat in the tree scene (which actually was shot but for some reason wound up on the floor of the edit booth!!) but all in all it is very true to the original text of the book and even incorporates some of the original poems into songs that work wonderfully! The bad news is that the colors in the master this was taken from have obviously started to  deteriorate- a common problem with films of the late 60's and early 70's - and it is grainy like an overused videocassette version!- Most companies spend a bit of time digitally repairing these problems before mastering them to a DVD -- this was aparently a BARE BONES ""digital remastering"" -- still -- the fading colors and sometimes blurry focus add an additional dreamlike aura if you can get past the idea that DIGIVIEW  REALLY CHEAPED OUT!! Still, it is a very inexpensive DVD so don't pass up this chance to see the movie now - then write to Universal - who is the current owner of this film and start crying for a TRUE REMASTER!!! Who knows, maybe someone will actually realize what a GEM they have here and give it the treatment it deserves!

2162862,2,B00062IZLI,"So, Alice's Adventures In Wonderland has been released on DVD.  That's the good news.  The bad news is that the print is so bad, I've got a ten-year old video taped from a TV with a faulty aerial in better shape!  So, only get this if you are desperate (it is cheap) and even then think twice and do without it.
The company concerned is Platinum Disc Corporation of La Crosse, WI, USA, and may God have mercy on them for having the nerve to put this out for public consumption. It's pan and scan, unsurprisingly and appears to be region free.  Pity the whole thing wasn't!  It's such a shame that it's not a decent transfer as it's an excellent film. In fact, I was quite surprised to find so much music not on the original Warner Brothers soundtrack LP.
The film itself is still delightful viewing, with Fiona Fullerton giving a very self-assured performance for one so young. And she, at least, is recognisable.  I suppose the drawback of employing some top actors and actresses in a film of this nature is that disguised as many are, it could be almost anybody!  But always good to see Peter Bull (The Dutchess) and Michael Hordern (The Mock Turtle) in any production.
So, definitely worth seeing but maybe wait for a better transfer to DVD.",1053648000,,1244,4.502222222222223

But anyway including all the recent versions I have seen of this film this still stands out in my memory as the best version made of Alice. Not entirely accurate but still very good from what I recall. I can't stand the Disney version and not one of the ones done from the 1980's to now were any good either. The only other good Alice film IMHO is Dreamchild about the original Alice (Hargreaves) coming to America to accept an honoray degree for Dodgson on the centeniary of his birth. A wonderful film that dealt with her 60 year or so memories of Dodgeson.
Anyway I think I also recall they did a version of Looking Glass as well but I can't find anything about it. I would love to see a re-release of a GOOD copy of this film and if they did make Looking Glass, that one too!",1040256000,,874,4.177514792899408
2162864,3,B00062IZLI,"Lewis Carroll's Alice's Adventures In Wonderland has been adapted to the stage, television and silver screen so many times, its fairly easy to lose count. This 1972 adaptation is really no exception. To be fair, this version vastly sticks closely to the origanal book but the silly, syrupy songs don't quite blend into Carroll's origanal ethos of the famous story. There were intentionally dark undertones in the book as though you were drawn into a childs nightmare but there has barley been any screen version that has captured the true spirit of Wonderland apart from a spooky, modern-day re-telling of the familiar story by Jan Svamkmajer in Alice (1988).
In this version Fiona Fullerton makes a pleasantly bland Alice in a somewhat confectionary telling of the story. With its uncomfortable transistion to the DVD format, the sets seem even more shaky and unreal. The cardboard-like sets seem far more suited for a theatrical production and it often loses the feel of its intended effect. If only more work had been put into the sets this might seem a lot better. On saying that what the film does often encapsulate is a dreamy, hazy-like feel and at times coming close to the origanal vision of Carroll. The film is engaging at the beginning which follows the enchanting scenes of Alice waking up in a giant, story-book garden. Its there where she sees the white rabit (played by Michael Crawford) and follows him into a dark tunnel. Its here where the adventure begins as she falls down a large rabbit hole into the whimisical, topsy-turvy world of Wonderland. These effective sequences work well and the music is masterful and hauntingly atmospheric. However once Alice reaches Wonderland the film is something of a hit and miss affair and at times its pace is a little tedious. Still there are some points of interest and lovers of the story will most likely deem this to be one of the most satisfactory film version made. There are plenty of other famous British actors/esses on show here with Dudley Moore playing the Doormouse during the amusing Mad Hatters Tea Party sequences, Ralph Richardson as the Caterpilla, Dame Flora Robson putting in an effective performance as the Queen Of Hearts, Spike Milligan as the gryphone, Peter Sellers as the March Hare, Dennis Waterman as one of the pack of cards painting the roses red, Robert Helpmann as the Mad Hatter, Michael Hordem as the Mock Turtle, Michael  Jayston as Sir Charles Dodgson (Lewis Carrolls real name - Jayston is in the opening sequence telling Alice a story on the riverbank which is where she falls asleep and the adventure begins) and Patsy Rolands taking the role of the Duchess's demented, plate-throwing cook to new heights.
The film was widely criticised and regarded by some as an unadventurous adaptation. Contrary to that the film could be praised for being such a loyal and faithful adaptation though like most other versions it tends to draw segments from Carrolls sequel, Alice Through The Looking Glas. Fiona Fullerton at this point was being promoted as the new Julie Andrews (though wasn't) but this did little to ignite the films fortunes and overall Alice's Adventures In Wonderland proved to be a relative failure. That year also saw the Roald Dahl book, Charlie And The Chocolate Factory (retitled Willy Wonka And The Chocolate Factory) adapted to the silver screen which won favourable reviews and was a big box office draw in comparison to this. To make matters seemingly even worse, Peter Sellers caused a minor stir by criticising the film himself before it had even opened at cinemas.
Still on the whole the film has some enchanting moments, some great playing from a capable cast and an often masterful score that helps build the intentionally edgy and atmospheric feel to Alice's adventures and on pushing some of its blatant shortcomings aside and focusing on more of its merits, its defintley worth a look and fans of the story will undoubtedly be enthralled.",1038009600,,3962,4.922272047832586

I was not prepaired for how wrong I could be.
It basicaly looks like they struck this copy from a mutilated 16mm projector print. The print has bad sprocket damage which causes the image to shake on the screen. It seems like they used the bulb from an easy bake oven to project this print. To call the picture muddy would be a compliment. All the life and color has been sucked out of this film.

Lewis Carroll's spirit, imagination, humour, wit, song and dance, and lunacy are all captured in this wonderful film. The only thing I would criticise about this production would be the choice of casting the actress Fiona Fullerton in the role of Alice: she's far too old, and perhaps too sexy for the role of an innocent little girl who fell down a rabbit hole.

2162880,5,B00062IZLI,"I'll echo the words of the previous reviews regarding the exquisite artistic quality and integrity of this film, and will also echo the extremely dissapointing DVD of what is truly a classic film.
If memory serves me correctly the film grain always had a bit of a soft look to it, but this particular publication of the film is longing for some sort of salvation from a major studio or film preservation society.  The DVD appears to be a duplication off of an old 3/4"" broadcast video tape, which itself was a done from either a very poor 35mm film print, a 16mm reduction print, or a contact print from a secondary or tertiary negative.  What's even more heartbreaking is the fact that a few seconds have been cut from the film; two or three lines of dialogue between Alice and the Mad Hatter, and a few frames of the musical sequence where the Deck of Cards first enters the garden.
All in all, regardless of the technical problems with this DVD, were I to reccomend a photoplay of Alice in Wonderland, it would be this one.  There've been some criticims of the music and ""wooden"" sets and the cardboard feel for some of the scenes in Wonderland itself, but one must remind oneself that it is afterall a children's film.  And I suspect the ""cardboard"" feel was intentional to give the film a story book essence.  And in my personal opinion adds great character to the movie.
My one distinct childhood memory from seeing it in the theatre was noting how utterly gorgeous and talented Fiona Fullerton was (and presumably still is).  It's truly a delight to see her and the movie again.  We can only hope that some wealthy movie mogul will come rescue this film before it is lost entirely.",1004572800,,1688,4.551155115511551
2162881,4,B00062IZLI,"I first saw this production on network TV back in the mid 70's when I was 7 or 8 and the my clearest memory of it was how much of a babe Fiona Fullerton was. Seeing it again at the age of 33, the quality of the film betrays its age, yet still maintains a timeless aura.
The film starts off well, with a feel and look that stays true to my visions of the Lewis Carrol tale. I thought Alice's drop down the rabbit hole, the great hall of doors, and the pool of tears were all very well done. Though the sets are obviously play-prodution quality, they still work for me. John Barry's score is excellent and adds a hauntingly beautiful touch that, I'm sure, Carrol would approve of.
As far as performances go, the film does seem a bit top-heavy with talent. Indeed, this production has more ""Sir's"" than King Arthur's round table, and unfortunately, as with some other ""all-star"" films, the overall product does not necessarily equal the sum of the parts. Though some actors do live up to their reputations (Peter Bull and Peter Sellers are delightfully mad.), several notables seem as lost as Alice. I was rather disappointed in particular with Sir Ralph Richardson as the caterpillar and Dudley Moore's doormouse is extremely forgetable. I am at a loss to explain why his face adorns the VHS cover. All babeness aside, Fiona Fullerton does a solid job, especially considering much of her dialogue is spoken to herself. My only complaint is she seems to be having a little too much fun in some of the scenes, which detracts from the surreal undercurrents of the tale and negates any conflict which might arise.
As with other productions of the Alice stories, I found this one contained certain incongruencies from scene to scene. The film can't seem to decide whether it's merely a children's tale or a darker venture into something else. The mad hatter's tea party, for instance, is completely brainless, with only Peter Seller's march hare bringing any insanity or intrigue to the scene. On the other hand, the chaotic mayhem in the Dutchess' house might very well give children nightmares. The quantity and mood of the musical numbers, however, does suggest that this film was targeted at younger audiences.
I suppose an eternal debate will continue over whether Carrol's stories purposefully contained deeper themes or were simply meant to be innoccuous fairly tales. As for this production, it succeeds in capturing a part, if not all, of the strange world of wonderland.",1001894400,,2473,4.766899766899767

Horrible picture quality (reminds me of a reel-to-reel projector) and only slightly better sound.  It's a shame too.  I remember this little gem of a musical from my childhood.  I was about 6 years old when it came out.  For me, Fiona Fullerton became the definative ""Alice"".  She really is wonderful...with that lilting little voice.  In fact, the entire cast stands out.  I love every minute of it.  I hope this gets re-re-released someday with total restoration in widescreen and dolby-whatever!  I'll buy it again.  In the meantime I'll watch this version regardless of how crappy it's presentation.  I do think I will avoid any DVDs by Platinum Disc Corp.  Do I smell somebody looking to make a quick buck?  At least I expect the picture quality to be better than a bad EP VHS recording!  I'd be interested in knowing if the quality of the VHS is better.  Anybody?
Anyway, DVD gets 1.5 stars...the movie itself is 4.5 stars (if you didn't grow up with this sort of thing then avoid this movie at all costs.  For me, ""Alice"" is up there with Wizard of Oz and Willy Wonka and The Chocolote Factory).  By the way, children should love the manic pace.  It's a blast!
Another note:  watching this I was reminded of the shows I used to watch at the time.  Sid and Marty Krofft (Pufnstuf) and so forth must have been inspired by this...or the other way around.",980985600,,1473,4.559386973180077
2162894,3,B00062IZLI,"This 1972 version of Alice's Adventures In Wonderland is unbalanced, hazy and ponderous, and does a far better job of capturing the essence of Lewis Carroll's fiction than any other film I've seen.  Except Caligula.
This movie relies largely on a cast of VERY established UK actors (Flora Robson as the Queen of Hearts, Peter Sellers at the March Hare and Ralph Richardson ... my absolute favorite even though he only has about four lines ... as the Caterpillar) and contains some of the most haunting music ever written by John Barry. The sets are beautiful, the costumes and makeup creepy/cool and the script in most ways adheres to the books upon which it is based.  As if I know what I'm talking about.  Amazon reviews are great!
As for the DVD transfer, it's crap.  Looks like someone taped it off TV with a camcorder and posted to YouTube.
But it's worth buying just to see Peter Bull nail the Duchess (not as dirty as it sounds).",980726400,,936,4.586826347305389
2162895,4,B00062IZLI,"When I first saw this film as a child, I was captivated.  Even as an adult I'm still enchanted by the whimsy of Wonderland.  This film isn't like the more commercially successful versions, but it's worth adding to your personal library!
Fiona Fullerton is a charming Alice.  Most other versions of the film shows us a very young Alice.  I don't think any other Alice could have portrayed the character quite like Fiona.  She's a bit older, but possesses the ability to act the part very well, something I don't think many younger actors could do.
The musical sequences are at times breif and essential to the story.  The film is rather old, and transfer to video was rather poor.  There's some very conspicuous flaws in the video, but despite this, the story is just as wonderful and magical as ever.  For a low budget and a superb cast (Dudley Moore, Ralph Richardson, et al) ""Alice's Adventures in Wonderland"" is a delight.
The sets were not extravagant, but very well done.  Some of the backgrounds reminded me very much of ""The Wizard of Oz"".
I'm glad to have found this version of ""Alice in Wonderland"" since it was the first I'd ever seen.  It will always be the version I compare others to, and despite the fact that this isn't a more commercially successful film, it won me over heart and soul.",972432000,,1302,4.573275862068965
2162896,3,B00062IZLI,"I first saw this seventeen years ago when i was just four years old and absolutley loved this nonsense fantasy-adventure classic. Now years later it perharps is slightly dated with its cardboard sets which seems more suited for a stage production. However it boasts some good effects (for that year anyway).
This is very faithful to the Lewis Carroll book and also draws from Through The Looking Glass. It begins extremley well where Alice follows the white rabbit into the tunnel which leads to her falling down the rabbit hole. This particular sequence which begins with her waking up in a giant garden is made effective from its haunting, atmospheric score which remains chilling throughout, creating the dark and often frightening image Lewis Carroll intended it to be. This is one of the few filmed versions that comes close to capturing the true spirit of Wonderland. On more than one occasion its pace is a little tedious and slow moving and the vast majority of the songs don't work. Never the less i would say this is one of the best  filmed versions i've een, especially given to its cast which includes Dudley Moore as the doormouse, Spike Milligan as the caterpilla, Ralph Richardson as The Mad Hatter and Dennis Waterman as one of the cards and of course a young Fiona Fullerton as Alice who is engaging in her role. There are many sequences which work well including Alice following the rabbit down the rabbit hole and the sequence in the forest when the storm brews and a giant crow emerges from the dark sky. This is where it draws close to capturing the dark and frightening vision of Wonderland as intended by Carrol and as said before the score helps create that essential atmosphere for a film/story like this.
This live action version of Alice's Adventures In Wonderland was generally poorly received by crtics and although this indeed is not brilliant its still good and entertaining with many high points in the film. Very much recommended to fans of this story.",970704000,,1985,4.7871720116618075
2162897,5,B00062IZLI,"This British film version of the Lewis Carroll classic ""Alice's Adventures in Wonderland"" is without a doubt the most faithful adaption to date!  (except for the addition of the Looking-Glass twins,  Tweedle Dee and Dum.). A surperb cast, lead by the talented Fiona  Fullerton, who makes a splendid Alice, is supported by some of Britain's  finest actors as the inhabitants of Wonderland; Sir Ralph Richardson as the  hookah-smoking Caterpillar, Michael Crawford as the ever-tardy White  Rabbit, Dame Flora Robson as the head-hunting Queen of Hearts and Peter  Sellers and Dudley Moore as the mad March Hare and his sleepy sidekick, the  Doormouse. The American popularity of he last two mentioned actors is why  the film was shown overseas here in the United States. Miss Fullerton may  seem a bit too old for the title role, but I don't think a child actress  would had enough scope to play Alice so well. (If you don't think so,  imaging if Sherley Temple won the role of Dorothy in ""The Wizard of  Oz"". YIKES! ), but I digress. The musical score is beautifully  haunting and so is the final song ""The Me I Never Knew"". This  song and ""Curiouser And Curiouser"" are the only two songs that  really stand out. Most of the other songs are corny little ditties with no  sense of what the characters are thinking or feeling. The sets look like  cardboard cut outs at times and the fast speed photography during the  Lobster Quadrille and quick cut shots at the mad tea-party look campy and  thus the overall British feel of the movie is lost. Despite all my negative  insights, I found this film version of ""Alice"" filled with the  wonderful, whimsical flavor that only Lewis Carroll himself could have  provided. A must see for all fans of the famous book.",964051200,,1755,4.73841059602649
2162898,5,B00062IZLI,"Very, very similiar to the score in ""Somewhere in Time,"" this beautifully haunting score to this wonderfully English movie is another of the great masterpieces written by the legendary John Barry, who brought us  the scores to Born Free, Dances With Wolves, Out of Africa, Chaplin and  co-wrote the James Bond Theme.  It supplies a delicately nostalgic and  quaintly victorian backdrop to the most faithful adaptation of Lewis  Carroll's book that I have ever seen.  A cavalcade of great British talent,  Ralph Richardson, Dudley Moore, and Peter Sellers among others, dressed in  character and performing many of the same painfully awkward and introverted  jokes as any of the very best Monty Python skits.  ""If they lived in a  treacle well, I should think they would be very sick!""  ""So they  were - very sick indeed!""  If you liked the movie ""Somewhere In  Time"" mixed in with the most ribald and perplexingly human  comedy of  Monty Python, go back somewhere in time with Lewis Carroll.

Her charm and wit arethoroughly in the nature of Lewis Carroll's delicious use of the English.

That is its main selling point. On the negative side, the characters at the bottom of the rabbit hole appear ludicrous and grotesque rather than charming and endearing. The costumes look like they have been bought at a cheap second-hand store or to be leftovers from a tawdry costume party. The makeup is garish, and children may find it frightening.

8037397,4,B00062IZLI,"I appreciate how close this production stays to the book, aside from the songs, which I skipped through. I noticed huge continuity problems between what must have been considerable lengths of time between filming some scenes. I'm only halfway through but have been jarred by Fiona Fullerton's change from being an innocent young teen with untweezed eyebrows to being an older teen somewhat gussied up, and then back to the more innocent version. I much preferred the younger version. Also the animal character's costumes go from partial to complete covering depending on when they were filmed? They started out with complete facial coverings and then some were only partial. And I believe the colors were richer in the later filming. So, some rockiness in the production but very impressive acting and I enjoyed it overall, probably mostly because I love the story. I very much enjoyed the scene in the Duchess' house but was concerned for the crying baby. They would not put an animal through what they put babies through in filming.
