5324693,3,B009FN0XD2,"This production offers serious Sherlockians relief from several problems that have plagued them for many years.  There are few `Americanisms.'  Most of the actors have proper, if `regional,' British accents and the script is reasonably free of obvious anachronisms.  Locations have a gritty, non-spiffed-up look and many of the characters and extras look like real people, not idealized Victorian stereotypes.

The movie begins during the latter stage of `The Blitz' in December, 1940 London.  An aged Dr. Watson asks his resident nurse to accept a manuscript and additional verbal notes about ""...his greatest and least known accomplishment.""  When the nurse asks ""Who is he?"" Watson replies, ""Sherlock Holmes.""

This tale opens in the English Channel, in 1882 with the destruction of an English transport returning ""The Queen's Shilling"" from the West Indies.  The actual method of its destruction is one of the unresolved points in the movie.  Various devices are never explained nor are their abilities described in any detail.  In essence, the viewer is shown only the effects, never the means by which those effects are achieved.  If that is satisfying to you, then you will probably enjoy the movie, as will most children.

Eventually, we are introduced to Sherlock's brother, retired Detective Inspector Thorpe Holmes, who was severely injured seven years before in line of duty while pursuing criminals with his then-partner, now-inspector Lestrade.  The story line is hard to follow, but is self-consistent and makes some sense in retrospect.  One must accept that the villain is a scientific genius and his inventions can perform in convincing fashion.

There remain a number of irritating anomalies.  Watson's 1882 office telephone is a 1940's model.  Inspector Lestrade seems to go about armed in contradiction to standard British Police practice.  The actor playing Sherlock (Ben Syder) is two or three inches shorter than the actor playing Dr. Watson (Gareth David-Lloyd).  The `monsters' are all treated as constructs, but no effort is made to detail their capabilities or inner workings.  The whole subject is simply left to the villain's marvelous medical discoveries and techniques.

The final events contain several severe contradictions as regards who is where and how they got there.  Time, distance and locations seem to be ignored in the entire sequence of events leading up to the climax.  Characters are moved around with no concern as to how they traveled from one place to another.  It is possible that there are explanations, but none are offered in the cut I saw.

5324694,4,B009FN0XD2,"...Sherlock Holmes versus giant monsters? Steampunk body armor? Spring Heeled Jack as the villain? It's a low-budget film that's at least as much about setting Buffy the Vampire Slayer into Victorian England as about the Sherlock Holmes character. As a movie, how is it though? Well, not bad, it's kinda fun, but you have to be willing to stomach the low-cost production (which shows all the way through), some rather campy acting (sorry guys!), and a ridiculous plot. But it is fun!

Negatives:
- Fundamentally dishonest in coming to market with a big Hollywood version of Sherlock Holmes in the theaters (and both versions have steampunked up Victorian London)
- Cheap, cheap, cheap

Positives:
- It's fun and funny
- Much in the tradition of Peter Cushing, Dr. Who, Quartermass, and Hammer Studios
- Do you like Buffy?
- Enormous monsters being fought by Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson (think of it as a reincarnation of the Godzilla vs. INSERT CREATURE HERE movies)",1262908800,65,969,4.938650306748467

The best part of the movie was Gareth David Lloyd as Watson.",1376611200,,355,4.0
5324702,4,B009FN0XD2,"There is a good reason they call this studio Asylum. These people are completely nuts. Except that they know exactly what they are doing. The budget for this entire movie was probably less than craft services on one of the RDJ travesties. They are kind of like Ed Wood without the delusions of grandeur. Try listening to the commentary.
Let me make it clear that I am intimately acquainted with the canonical Sherlock Holmes and despise works that are not respectful to the character. So the early photos showing an elfin Ben Syder were not promising. However he is no further removed from the image of the tall, lean, well groomed canonical Holmes than is the short, rumpled Robert Downey Jr. After all this is meant to be a knockoff of the RDJ film. With regards to the characterization I would say that Asylum is actually closer to the mark. In the scene where he walks off, announcing that if they hurry they can catch the seven o'clock train back to London and leaving the rest of the group still panting from their exertions in saving Watson, he nails the character as well as anyone I have ever seen. And I have a vast DVD library including everyone from Arthur Wontner to RDJ. So while I would not put Ben Syder in the league of Basil Rathbone or Peter Cushing he is at least as good as the absolutely wooden Charlton Heston.
Gareth David-Lloyd is possibly the best Watson I have ever seen and I would love to see him cast in the role in a truly canonical version of the stories.
Now as to the dragon. How could anyone not love a claptrap dragon made up of scrap metal and whatever was around the house? Notice that on the control panel is an inverted meat grinder. When Thorpe pulls back on the handle the dragon shoots a firebomb out of the near tail section. So yes I do love a fireball farting steampunk dragon.

As a Sherlock Holmes movie, it tried, but was marginal.  I think it was the actor who portrayed Holmes, he was nowhere near up to the standards of others who have played Holmes.

5324707,2,B009FN0XD2,"This is a cheap science fiction story - the kind told many times - and not a Sherlock Holmes type tale, the kind that Sir Arthur Conan Doyle wrote. It focuses upon Holmes investigating a sea wreck caused by an attack by an underwater giant prehistoric animal and the murder of some people by a dinosaur.

True, Holmes makes broad deductions from small items, such as a stone, and he has a side-kick, Watson, who once served in the army and is not too bright, but this is where the similarity ends. Additionally, Ben Syder who plays Holmes lacks the wit and force of the traditional Holmes, although he does fly in a zeppelin to save England and does fight a robot. Worse of all is the identity of the villain. Traditionalists will be surprised and appalled.",1341187200,3,757,4.525547445255475

You can not be seriously doing this!""

5324709,3,B009FN0XD2,"OK, so maybe this ""Sherlock"" is really named ""Robert.""

Maybe he never says Sherlocky things like ""Elementary, my dear Watson,"" never wears a double-brimmed cap, and is built like a one of those little lawn jockey guys who hold the lantern.

So maybe there's a giant, metal dragon, dinosaurs that walk around and roar and that's about it, a kraken (!) for no discernible reason and some flying creatures that appear in the trailer but I don't remember actually showing up in the film.

So maybe this Sherlock (sorry, ""Robert"") never actually deduces anything, never solves a mystery, never uses a magnifying glass to look at a clue. Maybe all he does is fly around in a hot air balloon and fight a guy in a metal suit that producers must have thought looks cool like ""Iron Man"" but is more humorously reminiscent of some 1950s B-movie robot.

Let's say all of this is true. Because it is. Does all that necessarily make it a bad movie?

No! Absolutely not! I mean, yes! Absolutely so! I mean... I mean...

I mean, it's really hard to think now that this movie has turned my brain into Dippin' Dots.",1327017600,2,1098,4.548223350253807

5324711,5,B009FN0XD2,"Wasn't sure I would like this version but.....it didn't SUCK. The actor who portrayed Sherlock Holmes seemed miscast at first, seriously who could EVER fill Basil Rathbone's shoes, but he grew on me as the movie progressed. Same with Dr. Watson. It was nice to see him portrayed as someone who wasn't quite the 'buffoon' that Nigel Bruce played it.

Although the story line was simply implausible, a dinosaur, giant octopus, fire breathing dragon and a robot woman, wreaking havoc on London all in the name of REVENGE...the movie was non-the-less VERY entertaining. The acting is what made it worth watching. It left me hoping there would be another movie in the making. Not sure what they could come up with the next time though. I'd say it was worth your time to buy this and give it a go.",1311638400,2,791,4.65
5324712,4,B009FN0XD2,"If your idea of Sherlock Holmes adheres only to a strict visualization of the stories as written by Doyle then you aren't going to like this movie.  But if your Holmes has a little wiggle room to be young or old, manic or calm, brooding or almost affable, then you might look upon it as a guilty pleasure. I will dwell on the positives.  It moves quickly so we were never bored.  The chemisty between Holmes and Watson is well done. Their relationship is close without being slashy.  Much of it takes place outdoors, eliminating the claustrophobic feel of limited funds for sets. The music is lively, pleasant. There's a lot of humor, especially in the banter between Holmes and Watson. And well, yes, there's a dinosaur, and other assorted mechanical monsters and contraptions (think Wild Wild West movie) if you like your fantasy on the surreal side. I liked it. It's got a heart, as another reviewer noted. I would much rather see a sequel of this than one of the Guy Ritchie film.",1309305600,2,984,4.605714285714286
5324713,1,B009FN0XD2,"I'm a fan of steampunk. Almost all kinds of steampunk. So a well-executed steampunk retelling of Sherlock Holmes is something that I would normally look forward to...

... unless it was from the Asylum, peddlers of cash-in abominations like ""Transmorphers"" and ""Almighty Thor."" Yeah, I made a noise like a strangled squeaky toy when I saw that.

So guess what kind of quality you get in ""Sherlock Holmes,"" which tries to spice up the canonical Holmes mythos with a ""lost"" tale of robots, dinosaurs, dragons and a giant octopus. The ridiculous sci-fi elements might have actually been entertaining if the acting weren't wretched, the story weren't as holey as moth-eaten lace, and it had a decent Sherlock.

The story is told by a dying Watson during the Blitz: strange animals like a giant octopus and a very small T-rex are popping up around England, and Holmes decides that they must be artificial (since the T-rex stole mechanical components).  Somehow this ends up leading them to the Victorian urban legend Spring-Heeled Jack, a person very close to Holmes whose revenge scheme may destroy all of London.

""Sherlock Holmes"" is painful to watch, all the more so because it actually could have been fun in a stupid way if a FEW things had been done right. The entire premise is a ridiculous hodgepodge of everything the Asylum thought would be ""cool"" -- monsters, robots, Spring-Heeled Jack, and a steampunk ""Iron Man."" And, well, it could have been fun.

Buuuuuttt.... they do everything spectacularly wrong. The direction and cinematography are pretty clumsy and sometimes amateurish, the comic relief is PAINFUL, and the story is brain-meltingly stupid (so... Holmes somehow kept the entire story a closely-guarded secret, even though it involves ships, factories and PARLIAMENT being destroyed by robot monsters?!).  And since this is the Asylum, the monsters are about as convincing as Chinese street dragons, but less fun to watch.

But the biggest problem by far is Ben Syder. Who is Ben Syder? Well, you probably have never heard of him, because this is his first, last and only role in ANYTHING. And I can't imagine a LESS convincing Sherlock Holmes. Syder is short, weedy, thin-voiced, hyperactive and completely lacking in charisma, like an annoying cousin who keeps dragging you into bad situations.

For some reason, Dominic Keating and Gareth David Lloyd -- both of whom have been in other movies and TV -- are stuck as the perpetually exasperated Watson, and the sleek Thorpe Holmes (yes, a Holmes brother we never heard of). Both look pretty miserable, and neither really tries that hard.

This ""Sherlock Holmes"" movie is probably the only one in existence that makes Guy Ritchie's look subtle and faithful to Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's writings. It could have been fun steampunk schlock, but is too pitifully inept to manage it.",1305504000,7,2846,5.023354564755839
5324714,4,B009FN0XD2,"Mousey? Oh, I get it. Holmes should be played by Hulk Hogan, Brian Blessed, or Tor Johnson. So what if this film was made to capitalize on the Downey flick? Ben Snyder is a thousand times better as Holmes than Downey's Iron Man/Bruce Lee/rock star travesty. Sure, I admit the movie had a thousand faults (for example, mercury poisoning from seafood was unknown in 1882), but it was fun. At least I was going ""ha ha"" (or ""yawn"") every few minutes rather than ""Eccch!""",1300579200,3,466,4.559523809523809
5324715,5,B009FN0XD2,"Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's iconic character Sherlock Holmes has been on screen since the days of classic serials right up until the modern era, but never like this. Written by Asylum partner and acclaimed 2010 Moby Dick scribe Paul Bales, the film opens in 1940 amidst the German blitz of London. An aging ""Professor"" Watson is on the verge of death, and wants to commit to history the true secret of Sherlock Holmes and how he saved London from unspeakable (until now), unimaginable destruction. Cue the flashback.

It's 1882, and in the English Channel a clipper ship carrying precious cargo finds itself under siege from a large, tentacled creature. Not the typical start to a Sherlock Holmes story, but that's part of the brilliance of this script. While the creature-context may seem out of place for a detective story, it isn't out of place for the source author. Doyle, after all, also wrote creature fantasies, the most recognizable among them being ""The Lost World,"" which has been the basis for no less than half a dozen films, including the second Jurassic Park and a certain Asylum monkey movie.

But back to the actual story: ashore, Holmes (Ben Syder) appears to a younger Watson (Gareth David-Lloyd) mid-autopsy to announce their summons to investigate the attack on the clipper ship. Holmes' acumen is quickly illustrated when he frees up Watson's afternoon by visually surmising all evidence any autopsy would have revealed. So let's see...smug, off-handed, unintentionally-condescending intelligence? Check.

So off go the original dynamic duo to a hospital where the lone survivor of the kraken attack, a midshipman with more than a quarter century before the mast, is emerging from his coma just as Holmes and Watson arrive. Nice touch here: when Watson bends to examine the midshipman, the tentacle-look to his stethoscope visibly freaks out the sailor. This is followed by his account of the attack, the what of it all, which Watson is quick to skeptically dismiss as shock manifesting as delusion. Holmes, of course, finds something in the midshipman's story worth believing, and so the investigation continues.

It's here another neat twist of plot first manifests itself: seems Holmes has an older brother he hasn't seen for seven years who's reported to be back on the London scene, and something about an embarrassment of some sort that resulted in said brother's full-paralysis. But this is just a quick hit, and the story moves on...

In London's seedy East End (Whitechapel-area, Jack the Ripper's hunting grounds), a young, naive virgin goes to visit a lady of the evening - appropriately named ""Mrs. Pinchcock"" - but this illicit tryst is unfortunately interrupted by the appearance of a ravenous dinosaur. Yep, that's right, you read me correctly: a dinosaur (at this point, my half-asleep wife muttered from the couch, ""Wait, why is there a dinosaur?"" Why, indeed, my love? Because The Asylum has learned a secret long known to purveyors of the fantastic: everything gets more interesting when a dinosaur enters the scene. Think about it, any movie you can name - Battlefield Earth, Annie Hall, Chariots of Fire; as great as they are, they'd be better with even one dinosaur thrown in for good measure. You know I'm right.)

So, just to catch you up, there's now a kraken and a dinosaur, and we're maybe half an hour in at this point. Awesome? Check.

Back to the bickering co-dependency of Holmes and Watson over breakfast and the morning newspaper. The story of the devoured virgin is there, and naturally captures Holmes' attention. The two take the customary perambulation for thought, which itself is interrupted by a hysterical and hysterically-high-pitched old man screaming nonsense about a monster in the woods. But it isn't nonsense, oh no. Cue dinosaur chase.

No spoiler to say our protagonists survive this scene, and it only fuels Holmes further, so he retreats to his experiments while Watson is called to see a patient, a wheelchair-bound man (Dominic Keating, a sort of British Jurgen Prochnow) attended by a beautiful young woman, his ""niece."" He requires medication for his many painful ailments, including the potent narcotic morphine. Watson is hesitant but eventually concedes, due in part to a shine he takes to the girl. He starts to make evening plans with her but Holmes cock-blocks him with an invitation to the East End to further investigate the findings of his analysis of the boy-monster(dinosaur) murder.

Our characters all now firmly in place, the rest is spoilers.

Okay, so that's a lot of plot, but believe me when I say my assessment doesn't do justice to the tightly-crafted twists and turns and melding of myth and literature this script accomplishes. Ultimately, I found this to be a thrilling film that hit on a cerebral, adrenal and even comical level.

One of the ways Sherlock shines and sets itself apart from other Asylum films was its lavish style, courtesy of the eye of director Rachel Lee Goldenberg. Each scene was replete with hue, texture and ambiance melding together to form a sepia-style, Burton-esque fantasy London, opulent in its steampunk-design that melds the worlds of Doyle, Jules Verne, and the recent filmography of Robert Downey Jr. into the perfect setting for an intelligent, action-packed sci-fi spectacle comparable in enjoyability - to me, at least - to its Hollywood tie-in. Aiding this effect are assured performances, atmospheric locations, accurate and fashionable costumes - I'd dress like either of these guys any day of the week, but I'm odd - astounding art direction, intense, well-designed and believable FX and a pulse-racing score. The script was inventive, respective, labyrinthine and familiarly comfortable, and easily the most engaging Asylum script of the year, with the possible exception of another Bales' project, a certain aforementioned whale movie. Goldenberg's direction was intense, exhilarating, ambitious and as such successful. Sherlock is the second film Goldenberg has directed for The Asylum, the first being Sunday School Musical. Her next project is the Asylum-family venture 1st Furry Valentine.

As for the performances, Ben Syder - for whom this is the only credit listed on IMDB - plays the famed sleuth as dismissively deadpan and admirably foppish, as though a brilliance such as his was to its bearer a frightful bore. David-Lloyd as Watson is the perfect counterpart to this, placidly skeptical and pointlessly loyal, a true sidekick.

Overall, and I know I'll get comments like I did when I made a similar declaration about Monster/Cloverfield, but I enjoyed this film more than I did the recent Hollywood version; for all their reinvention of the character, Ritchie and Downey turned him into a sort of lampoon of himself, too self-awaredly self-destructive and reckless for the legacy's own good - he's not a Victorian Indiana Jones, after all, but that's what Hollywood would have him. The Asylum's character feels just right, a balance of tradition and innovation that maintains the integrity of Doyle's hero. Syder may not have the swagger or smarm of Downey, but Sherlock Holmes isn't about swagger - he isn't a Victorian Shaft, either - he's about acumen, subtlety, and in those regards, Syder triumphs. A truly unique Sherlock Holmes experience awaits here, oddly appropriate for its liberties, and all-in-all, just plain entertaining.

5324716,1,B009FN0XD2,This in all liklihood is the worst movie I have ever seen.  It looks like it was made in a high school video project; the effects are cheesy and low-budget.  This has nothing to do with Sherlock Holmes and appears to have been created just to exploit the success of Robert Downey's movie.  Dreadful.,1296259200,6,299,4.5
5324717,4,B009FN0XD2,"I can best sum this movie up as the Holmesian equivalent of Sharktopus.

If that sentence makes you shudder, for heaven's sake, go watch some Jeremy Brett, because Holmes purists will last about ten minutes before becoming very, very shouty. If it makes you perk up a little and say, ""Oh yeah?"" then read on.

Everything that can be wrong with a movie is wrong here. The budget is so low that Holmes and Watson get one suit each, and the whole thing appears to have been filmed on the grounds of a large dairy farm. Holmes canon is taken out back early on and shot, like Old Yeller, and it's not a clean kill. I would, in fact, bet money that the screenwriter has never read a Conan Doyle story. There's a dwarf rubber prostitute-eating T-Rex. There's a rubber Kraken -- heck, maybe it is Sharktopus, the lighting's not that great -- that surely cost more to construct than it earns from robbing ships. Did I mention the rubber Kraken robs ships? The rubber Kraken robs ships. I'm still not sure what the T-Rex is for. The historical details are weirdly, hilariously wrong -- London's East End, for example, appears to be both subterranean and lit by masses of candles, like a Sting video. Holmes is teeny and Watson is tall, and their Baker Street digs are within walking distance of a scary forest. There is a climactic aerial battle between a mechanical dragon, piloted by Holmes' evil brother Victorian Iron Man, and a heli-balloon. And Gareth David-Lloyd gives a good performance.

After 15 or 20 minutes, the whole thing becomes so improbable, wrong, and bad that it turns entertaining, and even endearing. I watched it at a big girls' slumber party, and we went from dead silence to delighted incredulity to rolling with laughter. (""It's terrible,"" said one friend, ""but it doesn't hate life."") I suspect a little alcohol might improve the viewing experience even more, but alas, we're all lightweights. I also suspect we'll watch it again.",1286150400,40,1947,4.720588235294118

You see, no one *tries* here.  The dialog isn't just sloppy, pointless or moronic, it's boring.  The plot makes no sense and things happen because they have a CGI scene of it, maybe from another of their ""films"" so they'll move the plot to include it.  The acting is -- well, some isn't all THAT dreadful, but it's strangely cast, not very ""Victorian"", oh --  and a good number of the ""actors"" are just stage hands or friends mumbling lines, and the story gets so absurd that they must become cartoons, pushing their shame and realization that they're ruining their careers deep down, so now we all feel bad.

You'll know you've been had the moment they walk through the museum they've rented, babbling filler, watching shots that were cheaply cooked on a computer wondering how video stores could rent things the neighbor kid could do better.  It's not a real film.

This is made by a company called ""Asylum Films"".  They are known as the ""let's make a knock off in two weeks for pocket change"" film company that has dozens of other titles, most designed to trick consumers into thinking they're buying the REAL famous film that's out when it's this: the least amount of effort and money to turn a profit.  Look for the label, and put it back.  Asylum Films (and their Christian co-company that hawks religious films -- maybe no one cares if those don't make sense) should be shut down by Studios in that you have minimal expectations for even a really bad movie and these guys just ripped you off.  They've been doing this for a dozen years and are filthy rich.  Don't support their con.  Even a fake Prada Bag holds things before ripping apart, leather smelling like rotting horse flesh, the ink smearing.  This is a box claiming a fake bag is inside, but it's only an old paper bag, and it is infected by the plague, and I won't tell you what's inside but flies are all over it.

Asylum Films don't even try.

If you want to read more . . . The special effects are good to above-Asylum-average.  Some of the plot points are ridiculous, and some require more explanation.  However, fans of Sherlock Holmes can fill in the blanks and appreciate the extra references regarding Holmes.  Holmes is both intelligent and heroic . . . and possibly a recovering drug addict.  Watson is not a bumbling idiot but is instead a doctor and everyman.  Watson is not subservient to Holmes but his equal.

5324722,1,B009FN0XD2,"I had hoped ""Can Holmes save London from dinosaurs?"" would be a rip-off of a Professor Challenger tale with Holmes replacing Doyle's other series character.  No such luck.  The dinosaurs turn out to be robots created by a previously unknown brother of Holmes who also cured himself of paralysis by gadgetry that would cost a small fortune today, and now seeks revenge on ex-partner Lestrade.
Somehow Holmes knew this early on from staring at something on the ground.
  There's no denying the ending is exciting, but it has no place in a Sherlock Holmes film.  It's also is too similar to the one used in the far superior ""Great Mouse Detective"", which really was a cartoon.
  I don't care if the producers were looking to cash in on the recent theatrical film or not.  I only care if the film is good or not.  This one is not.",1272672000,15,826,4.527027027027027

I was curious about the dinosaur raptor on the case picture (looks like it was lifted from Jurassic Park), but, since I hadn't seen the movie at the theater, figured it must be something I hadn't seen in the TV commercials.

Shame on Asylum for making a buck on fools like me - and shame on me for falling for it.

THIS IS NOT THE DOWNEY THEATRICAL RELEASE - THAT ONE WON'T BE AVAILABLE UNTIL 30 MARCH 2010.

And shame on Hastings for putting this in the ""new release"" section.

I've definitely been punked!

As for the movie itself - (maybe this is a spoiler but...) robotic dinosaurs and mechanical women in Victorian England!  Times were grand, but not this movie.  Guess it was okay until the raptor arrived, then my interest steadily declined.  The actor how played Holmes was utterly miscast - 'mousey' has been used to describe him and that's an accurate description.  Watson was the only decent character (and actor).

I usually think of the old Basil Rathbone's version of Sherlock Holmes and think of stuffy acting on both his character as well as Doctor Watson but I was pleased that this was different.  The dinosaur took me aback but I did say ""unexpected!""  Gareth David-Lloyd was brilliant and a great actor, the guy playing Sherlock had to grow on me.

It was fun, delightful, interesting, nicely paced and all around brilliantly well done. It was a great good time.

5324730,1,B009FN0XD2,"How ""off"" can a production get from a target?  Well, if you're making this Sherlock Holmes film, I guess that we were lucky they spelled ""Sherlock Holmes"" correctly...

I actually WANTED to like this movie.  I bought it sight unseen and without even any description of the movie (Amazon didn't provide one).  I'm a Holmes fan and can find things to like about most productions.  I thought that the opening sequence (Watson during the Blitz in the 1940s about to relate an untold Sherlock Holmes tale) was done well and set the tone perfectly.

But then it went downhill.  Fast.

You have a Sherlock Holmes who is...well, MOUSEY.  He certainly doesn't fit any idea that I've ever had for the character.  Holmes wasn't the vibrant soul pushed to solve crimes that you might expect.  The screenplay take all sorts of liberties with the Sherlockian history giving Holmes a different brother - a policeman who was paralyzed by a bullet to the back while breaking up a bank robbery with Lestrade as his partner, and (spoiler alert) Sherlock isn't Holmes' real name because who would pay attention to a detective named ""Robert?""  There is even a hint that it was Watson who started Holmes on the path to cocaine addiction.

The acting was fairly wooden, and the script plodding.  That only made the pain last longer.

If there was one bright spot, it was the characterization of Watson.  Well done.

All in all, it wasn't worth the watching.  Something better just forgotten and move on.  Don't buy this.  If you feel the need, just rent it.  Save your money for pretty much ANY other Holmes movie.",1265587200,43,1591,4.712727272727273

A Movie well done & worth mentioning !

Must admit the DRAGON and BALLOON fought for my attention,Great fight sequence.
There is even a reference to IRONMAN or is it SPRING HEEL JACK...Loved this touch.

The visual look and tone seems to be a low budget effort to take advantage of the current steampunk craze.  Nothing works here. The story is lame. The special effects are preposterous.  The acting pathetic. This movie is a waste of time and money.  If you want some Holmes action, wait for the much better Robert Downey Jr. movie to come out.",1264636800,5,505,4.781609195402299
5324733,4,B009FN0XD2,"I love this kind of movie. Just a tiny bit hokey, but earnest with great chemistry between the actors.

Sherlock Holmes doesn't disappoint. Ben Syder and Gareth David-Lloyd work well together as Holmes and Watson, alternating between affectionate and snarky.

The Welsh locations double well for Victorian London. The scenery is often breathtakingly lovely.

The plot is interesting to say the least. There's a moment about three-fourths of the way through that had me reaching for the subtitle key (which there aren't any) to see if I'd heard it right. It was explained in the end. No, it wasn't a dialog blooper, and was pretty funny when the punchline was delivered.

Yes, there are monsters and some of the plot is pretty far fetched. But there are also some genuinely harrowing moments and clever dialog.

Enjoy.",1264636800,11,817,4.977941176470588
5324734,4,B009FN0XD2,"I got to admit I was really looking forward to this one but the trailer left me a little worried on the effects and on the acting fronts. First let me just say again, no one dare call this a rip-off when there has been many Sherlock Holmes movies made way before the theatrical title even came out so this is just another take on the master sleuth. I managed to go see see the big budget film in theaters mainly because I am a fan of Downey Jr. and now after sitting down to this film I got to say for entertainment purposes this film was much better. Sure it doesn't have the star power or amazing effects the other has but it has other things that make it much more fun. Like for example the villain has a iron suit he uses to walk in, there is a giant octopus and a very cool giant mechanical dragon, how awesome is that I ask you? So getting back to what I said earlier, I was a bit worried yes but after seeing the the film I got to say the acting was very good for the most part and the effects were good as well considering the budget and were only used to enhance the story for the most part which was not only a smart idea but it never over took the story itself. Filmed on location in Wales which really gave the film the look it needed, the scenery and settings were breath-taking. You have to take and judge every film for what it is and as far as this one goes I got to say I had a great time watching it and hope The Asylum decides to do a sequel at some point. Easily one of their better films filled with action,adventure, fantasy and humor. If you enjoy Sherlock Holmes I suggest giving this one a shot. The Asylum seems to just get better and better with their effects and the story here is a perfect match as well. The DVD comes with a ""Making of Featurette"" which gives you a good look at behind the scenes the obstacles they had to face while attempting to get this shot in two weeks time.

Sherlock and Watson are miscast and the special effects are horrible. While I will give props to the storyline for being different than most Sherlockian fare, The Asylum should've thrown a few more bucks towards this production, instead of rushing it out to capitalize on the Robert Downey Jr movie (which I know is what they do).

8541032,4,B009FN0XD2,"Call me crazy but I really like this movie a lot. Sure, it's from the Asylum Studios but their spin on the legendary character is pretty good. The story is a little wonky and farfetched when it comes to a dinosaur also being in the movie but hey, it's make believe, just go with it ok? The acting is pretty good too. Actors within this movie only have to be good enough to convey their emotions and to interpret the story the way it was written. You really can't take this movie too seriously and obviously nobody is going to get an Oscar for this movie either. However, even though the film is now 5 years old and this being one of Asylum Studios early releases, the special effects are pretty decent too. To me, even if the film had a bigger budget, they wouldnt have to go all out on the CGI. With a smaller budget and the low tech computer graphics that they used for the film, it was just enough to get the job done. Again, people can do so much when given more but the big challenge is getting big results with little resources. Not over the top, but it was what they needed. Overall, I really liked the movie. I like the cheesiness that came with it. To me, these movies never get old. This one was right up my alley.
