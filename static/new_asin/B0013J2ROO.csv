8251222,4,B0013J2ROO,"I saw it for the first time in Paris during the three-day moviefest.  It was captivatingly simple and totally charming. For three years, I looked for this movie I could play in the US.  There is nothing special extraordinary sophisticated or particularly outstanding in this film.  People live apart, meet by chance, get involved in each other's life and become fulfilled as a result.  The magic of the film is in believing it!",1279497600,3,427,4.808219178082192
8251223,4,B0013J2ROO,"Another romantic comedy from Audrey Tautou that capitalizes on her charm in ""Amelie"". The movie struggles along to build to a crescendo moment and never manages to climax. Furthermore, it winds up the storyline abruptly and with a bit of too much closure. Still, this is a sweet romantic comedy, with a nice little punchline in the end.",1241740800,4,336,4.810344827586207

8251225,5,B0013J2ROO,"This is a charming, funny yet poignant story of unexpected but believable friendships between several people that will leave you in a happy place. If you liked ""Amelie"", you'll love this one too, maybe even more so.",1207785600,4,215,4.837837837837838
