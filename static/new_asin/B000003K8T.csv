1178428,5,B000003K8T,"One of the more clever episodes in the Star Trek universe; WHY is Paramount witholding the video tape? Is there some exploitive agenda involved to make the fans grovel and pay through the nose? Is there some  vendetta with the writers, the actors, the fans? Is there anyone from  Paramount that can confirm or deny this officially?

1178429,5,B000003K8T,"I taped this program when it was first on and I've since worn out the tape watching it.  They should release this on DVD with a ""making of"" reel and the TOS episode!
I'll have to enjoy the VHS 'till they do.",996105600,,207,3.9285714285714284
1178430,4,B000003K8T,"Actually, Worf said ""They are Klingons and it is a long story... We do not discuss it with outsiders."" I wouldn't hold my breath for an explanation. I found a VHS copy I recorded when the show originally aired. Can't believe it's been sitting in a box all this time! It was a great episode and I am SO stoked to be watching it now....",994291200,,334,4.153846153846154
1178431,5,B000003K8T,"I've seen this as a gift box set including the original episde, the DS9 episode, and a tribble. Great idea, I thought, but where's the DVD version? C'mon Paramount - I'm waiting to buy.",991353600,,185,4.470588235294118
1178432,5,B000003K8T,"This is one of my most favorite DS9 episodes ever.  I was laughing constantly as Sisko and his crew encountered Kirk and the Enterprise crew.  I marveled constantly at the flawless integration of the DS9 crew into the old footage.  I couldn't tell!  I would definitely classify this as a ""fun"" episode.",988416000,,302,4.75
1178433,5,B000003K8T,"Over 30 years ago, the Original Star Trek series produced an episode that continues to be a favorite among fans even today. ""The Trouble With Tribbles"" was a silly episode with lots of humor.
30 years later, the producers of Star Trek : Deep Space Nine (the best series of the modern Trek era) created this wonderful episode...""Trials And Tribble-ations"". Using footage from the original episode, the crew of the Defiant go back in time to save Kirk from a vengeful Klingon.
This episode has many fun moments. The best one is when Bashir, O'Brien and Odo don't recognize the human looking aliens as Klingons. ""Those are Klingons?""
A great episode and a fiting tribute to the original. Definitely better than Voyager's tribute episode with Captain Sulu.",984355200,,752,4.929133858267717
1178434,4,B000003K8T,"This is an excellent episode...but is indeed available, at least in New Zealand.  Back during Christmas of 1999 I saw a PAL version of this episode--not to mention all other DSN & Voyager episodes except what was then the latest season--for sale in New Zealand bookstores.  They weren't pirated, but legit, above-board, Paramount tapes.  I'm happy for Kiwi fans and don't want to spoil their good fortune, but why not make these tapes available in the US?  Ratings?  Shame on Paramount for behavior worthy of a Cardassian!!",972777600,,523,4.9655172413793105
1178435,5,B000003K8T,"A genuinely humorous episode, T&T takes an extremely simple idea and  turns it into a rare comedy success for Star Trek. The almost complete lack  of plot seems irrelevant compared to the terrific sense of fun  that is  generated - a very refreshing contrast to DS9's general mood.  It's full of  great one liners, ""Forrest-Gump-like"" special effects and, most  importantly, it's a fitting tribute to the 30th anniversary of the  franchise.",965692800,2,440,5.098591549295775
1178436,5,B000003K8T,"Actually, you can purchase this video.  It's part of a set which includes  The Trouble with Tribbles and a Tribble Toy.  I think they aren't releasing  it as a single to force people to buy the special set and pay three times  as much.  The Ferengi would love Paramout!",965433600,2,269,4.387755102040816
1178437,5,B000003K8T,"I saw this epsode on tv and loved it , It was well done and a gret mix of the old and new i would buy it if paramount rereleased it ... The trouble with tribbles is my favorite tos episode and to mix it with the deep space  nine crew was a great twist to an old favorite",964224000,,270,3.5762711864406778
1178438,5,B000003K8T,"I saw this episode on TV and loved it! The blending of the classic ""Trouble with Tribbles"" with the newer DS9 series was brilliant! It would appeal to Star Trek fans both new and old.  Why this one has not  been released for sale on video is beyond me!  It would certainly sell  numerous copies!",959385600,2,295,4.3090909090909095
7902632,5,B000003K8T,"For the Star Trek fan, the ""Trials and Tribblations"" episode of Deep Space Nine is a must-have. It mixed footage from the original Star Trek seamlessly, creatively and innovatively with DS-9. A must-see!",1339113600,,203,5.181818181818182
7902633,5,B000003K8T,"Sooner of later what was happening in the movies with ""Zelig"" and ""Forrest Gump"" was going to make a move to the small screen, which is as good an explanation for the fun of Episode 103 of ""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine,"" ""Trials and Tribble-ations"" (Story by Ira Steven Behr & Hans Beimler & Robert Hewitt Wolfe, Teleplay by Ronald D. Moore & Rene Echevarria, ""The Trouble With Tribbles"" written by David Gerrold, Aired November 4, 1996).  The ""Defiant"" return from Cardassian space with the Bajoran Orb of Time along with Arne Darvin (Charlie Brill), a Klingon who has been surgically altered to pass as human (gee, doesn't that sound familiar?).  Darvin uses the Orb to send the ""Defiant"" and its crew back over a hundred years to Deep Space Station K-7 where the U.S.S. Enterprise, Captain James T. Kirk, commanding, is in orbit and suddenly we find ourselves in the classic original ""Star Trek"" episode, ""The Trouble With Tribbles.""
Darvin turns out to be the same spy that was caught by Kirk poisoning the grain shipment.  Darvin wants to change history by killing Kirk, so Sikso, Dax, Bashir, and O'Brien dress up in period uniforms and search the Enterprise for Darvin.  Meanwhile Odo and Worf, check out the space station.  Granted, the interaction between the two casts consists more of cuts than using computers to insert the DS9 gang into the original ""Star Trek"" episode, but that does not take away from the fun, and there is a lot of fun to be had in this episode.  The best moment is when O'Brien and Bashir join Odo and Worf at the station bar when the Klingons show up and start baiting Scotty and the Enterprise men.  The other three all stare at the Klingons, then at Worf with his all those ridges on the top of his head, and then back at the Klingons with their smooth brows.  But to their questions about what happened, all Worf will say is that Klingons do not talk about it with outsiders.  This may well be the funniest moment in ""Star Trek"" history (my second choice would be Captain Picard's Shakespearean monologue when he is trying to win Lwaxana Troi back from an amorous Ferengi).  Dax mooning over Kirk is not half bad either.
Clearly ""Trials and Tribble-ations"" is a unique crossover episode for the ""Star Trek"" universe, and fortunately there was no attempt to duplicate it with a similar project.  Actually, since you can make the argument that not since ""The Trouble With Tribbles"" has there been a ""Star Trek"" episode that was so totally in the spirit of fun, that ""Trials and Tribble-ations"" is just the big cosmic wheel coming full circle.",1072828800,4,2576,4.676991150442478
7902634,5,B000003K8T,"All I can say is Tehcnology has come a long way. In watching this episode of Deep Space 9 I was enchanted by the possibilities of what we can now do.
What was never real is now real, what could never be thought of before can not only be thought of but made into the illusion that is reality.
None of this makes sense? Watch how a early 90's (1994)show, cast, sets, props, costumes and more physically combine with the cast, sets, props and costumes of the Mid 60's (1966)s. Avery Brooks (In 1994) is acting with William Shatner (In 1966) and never ever having been on the same set and over 30 years apart.
The story in this episode is simple but effective, but the details in recreating the original Eneterprise sets, cistumes, props and even the Model itself was expertly done. (Probably better then they did it back int he 60's!) I got to believe the cast and crew had a great time on this one.
This is a must for every Star Trek fan - even if you did not like Deep Space Nine overall. It was my least favorite of the Star Trek incarnations - a little too dark for me. But watching Odo, Work, Kira and especially Dax interact with the oridinal Star Trek series crew is well worth it.
Bravo! - Buy this and watch it with the original series episode ""Trouble With The Tribbles"" and see technologically and creative film-making at its best!",1023753600,2,1339,4.36
7902635,5,B000003K8T,"oF THE TWO BOX SETS I HAVE PURCHASED, THIS IS PROBABLY MY FAV ONE, BECAUSE IT GIVES YOU EPISODES FROM CLASSIC STAR TREK AND ds9.

7902636,5,B000003K8T,"One of the most popular original Star Trek episodes is ""The Trouble with Tribbles"".  So, when it came time to celibrate Star Trek's longevity, the people in charge of Star Trek: Deep Space Nine decided to incorporate ""Trouble with Tribbles"" into a new episode.  The result was ""Trials and Tribble-ations.""  It is amazing to see Captain Kirk (TOS) ask Chief O'Brien (DS9) who started the bar fight!  Or to see Captain Sisko get Kirk to sign a work-order.  But beyond the technical aspects, the writers of this episode managed to keep the humor and charm which made ""Trouble with Tribbles"" so fun. One such element being when Sisko and Dax are looking for the booby-trapped tribble and are tossing the ""OK"" ones through an open hatch on onto Kirk!  This is without a doubt my favorite DS9 episode (even if my review is bad).",1012348800,,822,4.673611111111111
7902637,5,B000003K8T,"DS9's 30th anniversary tribute to the franchise is the usual timecop routine of travelling back in time to preserve history, Forrest Gumping Sisko and company into the single most popular TOS ep ""The Trouble With Tribbles"" (and a little bit of ""Mirror, Mirror"" as well).  Arne Darvin, the human-looking Klingon spy, learned about the Cardassians' return of the Bajoran Orb of Time and uses it to take the Defiant back to Deep Space Station K-7 to assassinate Kirk and restore his lost honor; Dax provided the greatest humor with her desire to reexperience the era and her commentary on Spock, Koloth, and McCoy.  Great attention to detail was paid to the reconstruction of the original sets and makeup effects, to the point that Walter Koenig stumbled onto it while at Paramount on unrelated business and wanted to shout ""Keptin!""  The visual effects were excellent: exterior shots of the Enterprise and K-7 were much better looking than the original footage, and they were able to seamlessly remove people from the original footage and replace them with the current actors.  This even added extra humor to some scenes: when Kirk sits on the tribble and looks around the bridge for an explanation, Dax gives him a shrug when he turns to her at first.  The ep also comes close to explaining away the Klingon makeup differences between then and now.",1011139200,,1347,4.890350877192983
7902638,5,B000003K8T,"The whole Worf-lavender thing was comical.  Plus, we got to see the best episode from the Original series put into the POV of a better (in my opinion) series.  It was one of those really, really good episodes that if you missed it on television, it's a good idea to buy it.",1004832000,,273,4.230769230769231
7902639,5,B000003K8T,"This is definetely one of the best Star Trek episodes ever made.  It appeals very well to new fans and old ones, no matter which series you like best.  It's great to see tribute payed to the old show, and the way it is done with the DS9 characters is just as good.  When Sisko meets Kirk is probably one of the classic moments of all Star Trek.  If you like DS9, I definetely suggest this.  But I also suggest it alot if you like the original.  It is exciting to see the old sets and uniforms recreated, and to see the new characters interacting with the old in scenes you'll recognize.",999820800,2,586,4.1875
7902640,5,B000003K8T,"The newer Star Trek series have had more believable characters than the original series but the ability to combine an episode of the original series into one of the newer series by way of computer imaging and digital remastering makes this a 5 star attempt.  And on top of that, Dax makes such wonderful observations regarding the characters -- especially the beautiful backhand she delivers regarding Kirk's sexual appeal versus that of Mr. Spock and Dr. McCoy!  Excellent!",996969600,,474,5.064102564102564
