8514308,4,B000Q0B0I0,"This is a great classic movie.  Some great old style skiing is shown.  Dick Barrymore plays some outrageous characters in the film.  The ski scenes from Iran are impressive.  Makes me want to see diplomatic relations re-established. I would love to ski that mountain.

The ""Nervous Muscle"" is awesome.  I have never seen anyone else tailwalk skis like he does.  Great entertainment for the whole skiing family.",1345766400,,410,5.029850746268656
