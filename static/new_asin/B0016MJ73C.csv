8263224,5,B0016MJ73C,"Out of all the Martial art Essentials that make up this collection as a whole,this is in my opinion the best of the Best LOL literally.

Every movie on this set is a sure-fire hit though it isn't technically six films with five of them being movies and the 6th being a documentary. The documentary is really good although dated. I'm not going to break down every movie on the set but just know most of them are available to watch for free on YouTube so you can be smart and check some of the titles out there first and then if you'd like you can come back here and buy this set.

Highly recommended and a must-buy for Kung Fu fanatics",1516752000,,634,4.188524590163935
8263225,4,B0016MJ73C,"I bought this collection for 7 Steps of Kung Fu.  This score is only for that film.  There's missing frames in it.  It skips over some parts during the fight where that girl in red is captured by Little Tiger and his master.  I have a different copy of the film where this does not happen.  It also has some parts where the English dub switches to Chinese (Mandarin?) but there are no subtitles available.  My different copy has this problem too.

Lastly, like the different copy that I own, it has some parts cut out in the very beginning of the film.  It's not a fight scene but I've seen an old VHS released by Ocean Shores that contains this scene.

So, it would have been 5 stars if not for those missing frames.  I expected the English dub problem to happen on this release too but the price was so nice at about $4 bucks that it was a must buy.",1420329600,,851,4.1656441717791415
8263226,5,B0016MJ73C,"Six movies in this volume and for anyone who enjoys old school martial arts the first feature ""Top Fighter""  is enough to make this purchase worthwhile. Top fighter is about the history of Martial Arts. The story is told by showing bits and pieces of some of the best fighters in martial arts films while the narrator guides you through it. Top fighter also provides details about the lives of these great fighters. It also includes ""7 Steps of Kung Fu"" and Super Power which are two of my favorites which I already owned. Fearless Dragon is also one of the better battles in martial arts films. So if you needed one great reason to own this volume it is because Top Fighter can be your guide to know what other films you will like because it is an index of various fighters and fighting styles.",1409011200,,795,4.445205479452055
8263227,3,B0016MJ73C,Volumes one and two were superior in scope.  Volume 3 three lacks any box office bonanzas.  The films are only adequate.,1372809600,,120,4.666666666666667
8263228,4,B0016MJ73C,"True to the name, three of the films in this anthology - namely Fearless Dragons, 7 Steps of Kung Fu and Call Me Dragon - aptly reflects its namesake - it is indeed martial arts essentials and best of the best as it contains unparalleled fight sequences, i.e. to say, some of the best fight choreography ever captured on film. However, it needs to be said that the impressive fight sequences only come towards the end in the final fight scene. Life on the Line, though is better than average and the other two films are not worth the time it takes to watch. Having said that, be aware that like most anthologies featuring more than two movies, the picture and sound quality is less than satisfactory. Overall, worthy to have in your collection.",1370908800,,744,4.559701492537314
8263229,5,B0016MJ73C,"When I saw the title Fearless Dragons on the box, I was reminded of a Chinese martial arts film I rented back in the late 80's.  It was in beta format and was entitled Fearless Dragon (not Dragons).  According to the text on the back of the box, the exteriors were filmed in Ulan Bator with the interiors shot at a HK studio - definitely not Shaw Bros. or Golden Harvest.  This was an independent production.  I remember nothing about the stars, writer, choreographer, director, or production company, but I do vividly recall several scenes.  One scene I'll never forget entailed the villain's assistant, an exotic Chinese woman with exceedingly long eyelashes, who drowns several - three, as I remember - babies in a lake in an attempt to get the villagers to tell her superior where the hero was hiding.  The scene was very convincingly executed, and I can only conclude they used robotic babies, as they were moving their arms and looked very real.  I'm certain they didn't kill real babies for a stupid movie, but it did look authentic.  My girl friend was so disgusted that she left the room.  The final battle of the movie consisted of some very grisly deaths with plucked eye balls and man's nose chewed off.  This was definitely a movie I'll never forget.",1361577600,,1263,4.648648648648648
8263230,5,B0016MJ73C,I watched some of these at a friend's house the other week. I loved it so much that I had to order my own copy. This whole thing is so cool. Its gonna look awesome with the rest of my DVD collection.,1226188800,2,199,3.761904761904762
