2765490,2,B000NDJGTK,"It's never a good sign when filmmakers can't figure out what to call their films.  This one was originally marketed under the name of ""Fast Track"" (the defunct title also shows up in the end credits -- whoops!), indicating that it's about the hijinks to be found in the corporate zeitgeist.  Then the name was changed, ostensibly to draw focus to the alpha male struggle that makes up much of the plot.

Such card-swapping doesn't make much difference.  This movie, by any other name, would smell just as stanky.  Zach Braff, donning a personality as interesting as acetate, plays Tom Reilly, a recently fired chef who gets a job at his father-in-law's advertising agency.  Also employed there?  His wife's sorta-kinda-ex-boyfriend, Chip, who also happens to be a passive-aggressive wheelchair-bound jerk.

So, let's see ... the advertising milieu means lots of commercial gags, we have an upwardly-mobile careerwoman stuck playing homemaker in suburban Ohio (""Look at all the white people,"" Tom says when they first drive into town), Tom is working for his father-in-law (a wealth of material there, even if it is dusty), and look at that cast!  Zach Braff, Amanda Peet, Jason Bateman, Charles Grodin, Mia Farrow, Donal Logue, Amy Poehler, Fred Armisen, Paul Rudd, Romany Malco.  I love all those folks!  On paper, this looks like it has the potential to be a great movie.

Maybe they should've written some more stuff on that paper, though.  Like a coherent plot, or funny jokes, or creative character struggles, for example.  Instead, we have pratfall after pratfall, lots of ""cripple jokes,"" and a kid who can swallow an entire hamburger without chewing once.

Braff and Peet play it straight to an entire cadre of wack-jobs (Sofia attends New Age Baby Classes where moms ask their infants for permission to pick them up; Tom's co-workers toss around a pretend ""teamwork"" ball and aren't allowed to say ""I'm sorry"" unless in writing), but none of these weirdos is given much room to stretch.  Of all the talent in the film, only Grodin's father-in-law Bob comes the closest to making an impression.

It's not his fault.  The script needs multiple doctors.  Chip sabotages Tom every chance he can get, but instead of calmly explaining his predicament to his family and friends, Tom pulls the classic screwball comedy move of fighting fire with fire, making himself look jealous, insenstive to Chip's handicap, and pretty much crazy.  I'd even accept this turn of events if Tom's responses were a little zanier than, for example, stealing Chip's yogurt or (very very) poorly concealing a camera beneath a tented magazine.

These are really bad ideas, both for revenge and for a movie.  The makers of this dud should've done more than just tinker with the title; they should've retooled the whole thing, preferably with the help of the comedically proven cast.",1181174400,23,2861,4.991561181434599

2765831,1,B000NDJGTK,"Okay. Unlike many others who hated this film with a passion for its (obviously unexpected) Dark Comedic Theme, I actually SAW the Trailer for it, knew what to expect, and it delivered. On that note, the thing that turned me OFF about the film, was its BRAZEN, OVERLY EXTENSIVE and ULTRA-AGRESSIVE Apple Product Placement. Every single Laptop (and there WERE MANY) was an Apple Laptop, and it's more than obvious that the director/filmographer MADE CERTAIN to have all camera angles (containing a Laptop/Laptops) wide enough so that the Logo shows. I know Product Placement isn't anything new, and that many companies partake in it (Best Buy was mentioned in the film by Charles Grodin's Character and an In-And-Out Burgers bag was held by Zack Braff's Character, for example), but THAT WAS ABOUT IT for those two companies. They didn't DRENCH the film in shameless plugs for those two Brands as they (and SO MANY OTHER FILMS) did with Apple Laptops. This may not be an issue to most people (I'm willing to bet that, in fact, IS the case), but for me... Enough is enough! I can only take the overindulgence of that companies products in films. I refuse to watch any film where I see multiple products of theirs in the Trailer. I don't care how much I may like the actors involved or how interesting the story may seem. I've read about Apple aggressive Marketing Strategy and how it's only growing more and more aggressive with time (semi-understandable considering that their competition has surpassed them severely a few years ago), but... Wow. Just... Wow.  Apple knows no bounds when it comes to stooping low and the desperation of overly-done Product Placement. Tim Crook & Company should be ashamed, but.. If it's effective, I guess that's all that matters. Oh, well. 

The film itself, as I've said, delivered on what was shown in the Trailer. Anyone who's a fan of all 3 of the main Actors (and/or Actress in Amanda's case), should know what to expect. I can relate to Zack Braff's Character in the film, because I'm also one who has a 'knack' for sniffing out fake/deceptive/backstabbing people/co-workers/classmates and I'm NOT afraid to speak up and call them out. I'm very much satisfied with the end. Also, stay tuned for an Extra Scene that comes up Mid-End Credits for an additional laugh that further drives the films' end deep into the outfield and over the wall!

Jason Bateman was his signature sarcastic self and always does that well.  Amanda Peet's performance fell in between the two.  I'm glad it was only 90min b/c I would have had a difficult time stomaching the rest of the movie.

2766244,1,B000NDJGTK,Zack Braff is great but it feels like he's in the bizarro world throughout the movie. It's just very awkward and uncomfortable at times how everyone is against his character and no one realizes that he's the only normal one and everyone else is nuts!!! Batemans character is obnoxious and way way to over the top to be even slightly believable. I wish it was better with the stellar cast but the writing was just crappy.,1433116800,,420,4.5394736842105265

Zac Braff is mostly sympathetic and Charles Grodin and Jason Bateman shine a bit but the rest of the very talented cast is mostly left to fend for themselves without much to do Plus it really isn't as funny as it should be. The subject matter is passive-aggressiveness in the office workplace and that has to be handled better than it is here or it just reminds each of us of our daily hellish existence. The movie runs out of steam in the third act and then just folds up and puts itself away. Not worth seeing again and not worth paying for.,1430438400,,570,4.238532110091743

Jason Bateman plays a rather dislikable character, Zach's nemesis, but it provides quite a bit of comedic material. It actually reminded me sometimes of Dumb and Dumber, however I liked that Zach's relationship with his wife was kept more on the realistic side. It was a good balance to the crazy stuff.

2766587,3,B000NDJGTK,"I've always thought that Justin Bateman doesn't get the kudos that he deserves.  He has nearly perfect comedic timing, and that is rare; he comes in at the right time, he speaks at the correct speed, and he ends on time too.  You don't see this very often anywhere, unless you perhaps watch a really good stand-up comedian, already comfortable in his craft.

But when you make a film that so unashamedly rips off another -- ""Meet the Fockers,"" anyone? -- then even someone such as Mr. Bateman can't save it.  It didn't take me very long to realize that I'd seen this film before, that this one was just repackaged with slightly different characters, but it was the same.  And surprisingly, this one might be even more mean-spirited than the film from which it ""borrowed.""  (OK, stole.)

When you go dark with comedy, there is a very fine line between becoming nauseus or becoming nauseated.  I think that the Ben Stiller movies pushed the envelope there, but for the most part, I still mildly liked them, probably mostly due to the oddly-strong comedic chops of Robert DeNiro.  Here, Charles Grodin -- whom I love by the way, and wish would make more films -- reprises that role and, while surely not doing as well as Mr. DeNiro, isn't a complete disaster either.

But I did really like the child character here, the one that can eat a hamburger in one bite and then one swallow.  Every good quirkfest needs this quirky character, and while I might argue that this film is not very good, it does follow this rule, at least.  But I have no idea what his name is; he didn't even seem to get supporting credits, which is really a shame -- and a crime.  In reality, he might have been the life of this lifeless party.

I'm going with a 3 today, mostly as I got a few laughs, and the ""kid"" character was very funny, once again.  I could easily go 2.  But I will still have to give at least a mild pass on this film, even though Mr. Bateman is in it, and even if that ""kid"" is in it, and recommend the ""Meet the Parents"" series instead.  If you only want to become mildly nauseus.",1425340800,,2074,4.3733681462141

2767265,3,B000NDJGTK,"I was surprised by how funny it was.  Jason Bateman played a rather creepy role and I enjoyed it as he usually plays ordinary nice guys.  This is not the ""best"" comedy you will ever see, but was a good movie to view on a ""do nothing"" Saturday night.  Not all the jokes landed but enough did to make it rather enjoyable.  Zach Braff brings most of the humor.  You will not recognize Amy Adams.  The downside of the movie was the typical New York City point of view that the Midwest is populated with backward idiots.  Hey Hollywood, bet Manhattan has a lot of ""white"" faces, too.  That particular comment was not appreciated.  And, no, I don't live in Ohio.",1415923200,,656,4.355371900826446

2767407,1,B000NDJGTK,"This movie was terrible, I love the actors but I regret watching it. What is the message of this movie? I am still not sure... It's OK to be a stay at home dad or if you live in NY you would hate OH, or is something else? I love comedies and usually there is a message behind all the funny jokes. I didn't find this movie very funny either btw. Unfortunately I also found it disturbing that the guy in it ended up being the stay at home parent. If he couldn't be committed to a job, how is he going to be committed to raising a child? Have you ever met a good parent that is not a responsible person? I think this movie was about promoting the traditional gender role switch in our society, I honestly don't know if there was anything else in it. Probably not the best message for a comedy",1413936000,,789,4.064102564102564
2767408,2,B000NDJGTK,"Wanted to like this one!  I'll watch anything with Jason Bateman. He's sort of the new Greg Kinnear, maybe? Enjoyed Amanda Peet's performance. The surprise was a compelling Crinkly Smile Dude turned in by 80s legendary character actor Charles Grodin, who showed big scary teeth every time he recited an outrageously silly, meaningless business affirmation that made me laugh like The Office, early days.

But what happened here? I watched part of it 2x to try to figure this out, and see if the problem was my mood.

What never worked for me was the incredible volume of stacking too many heavy non-stop gags with elaborate set-ups that failed to matter. So after a certain point, I found myself no longer tracking funny bits, just reacting to the next setup, and the next, but with no payoff. So ultimately, I didn't care. I think you could say this kind of gag barrage combined with intense self-commentary works great with 45-minutes of TV with short sequences broken by commercials, and it can work with improv. But it didn't work for me in this movie.

What's more fun than the premise  *all these characters are extra-weirdly flawed, and completely unaware of it* -- which of course makes them whack while attempting normal? So of course the misfit theme, it was compelling enough to start. Too bad  it all got drowned by concrete-shoes full of endless looping setups and (otherwise great!)non-stop physical comedy, chained to exhaustive selfie-angst comments by The Ex's nice guy loser hero.",1413936000,,1498,4.924603174603175

As far as I can tell this was a vessel to display why Zach Braff is terrible.  It's like there was a Chip in real life and he sensed he could sabotage Braff's career.  ""Here, just be in this movie.  Nooo, don't worry about the lack of development or that you have no redeeming qualities, it'll work out in the editing.""

As for the character he played, there was absolutely no reason to root for him or pull the audience in to have a desire for him to succeed.  The only reason to not despise him is he's portrayed as the protagonist, and Bateman's character (another great performance by him) is even worse.

As far as Braff's acting, he is weak and has a sort of I-won't-enunciate-anything-I-say delivery.  It's like he's constantly talking to a small puppy.  It becomes almost grating watching this many minutes of that back to back.

I'm not even a person who doesn't like Braff, but I think this movie turned him in my mind.  I will not be rushing to click play on anything else he's supposed to be the ""lead"" in anytime soon.",1412035200,,1194,4.481481481481482

Now, as far as Zach Braff's character goes, it's very similarly written as his character on Scrubs, JD, was written. So, if you like the funny, and awkward moments of his on Scrubs, you will love this movie.
Jason Bateman's performance in this movie actually made me think more highly of him as an actor because of all the practice and such he had to have with the wheel chair, and his natural talent for physical comedy. Great Movie.

Totally worth the three dollars, and I also purchased an additional copy of it to send to my sister who is stationed in Japan with a new baby and is very similar to Amanda Peet's character-go figure, my sister's name is Amanda too, and a husband similar to JD's character, she's the adult, and he's the grown man with the fun and little kid mentality.",1300060800,,1089,4.31219512195122

2767559,1,B000NDJGTK,"When a film stars a slew of respectable actors and or comedians and or celebrities you kind of hope and pray that the film is going to be good; right?  You hear the name Jason Bateman and you think of that subtle humor that coats his serious tone and you get kind of excited about what he'll do with his role.  You hear the name Amanda Peet and you recall her scene stealing work in `The Whole Nine Yards' and dream of her capitalizing on that shining moment of brilliance.  You hear the name Mia Farrow and you think `OMG, ACTRESS' because she is, like, the definition of one.  You hear the name Zach Braff and you think of `Scrubs' and the fact that he carries that show on his shoulders with his spin on the whole `man-child' theatrics.  You hear the name Amy Poehler and you think of her hilarious SNL skits, or Amy Adams and her dynamic knack for creating layered comedic characters.  In less rambling terms; you see all those names on the front of this DVD and you expect a sleeper hit.

If you expected that then you would be DEAD wrong.

The film is barely funny (I thought MAYBE one or two scenes were funny) and in the end it is insultingly predictable and somewhat (ok, a lot what) preposterous.  It was like the filmmakers (screenwriter, whatever) got stumped by his own formula and decided to just throw every possible logistics he attempted to create out the window.  I mean, the whole character that is Chip is a complete waste of time and energy, and that character was handed to Jason Bateman!!!

WHY?!?!?!?!

Yuck; this movie is so incredibly stupid I want to beat my face against a wall for wasting the time reviewing it (not really, but almost).

Anyways, I don't even know if it's worth the time, but I'm bored so get a whiff of the plot.  You have Tom and Sophia who are married and in love and have a baby.  Tom can't hold a job, and Sophia (who has a successful legal career) has decided to put her career on hold to raise their new baby.  Tom, recently jobless, accepts an offer to work at an add agency with Sophia's father.  The agency is weird and eccentric (unbelievably so) and so obviously Tom is out of place.  Then Tom meets Chip, a wheelchair bound middle aged jerk who once slept with Sophia and (creepily) makes his affections known for her every way he can.  Surprisingly (or should I say, clich&eacute;d-like) no one by Tom even notices all the blatantly obvious ways with which Chip proves himself a total creep.

Of course, the whole world loves Chip, Tom comes inches from losing his wife, and then instantaneously the world realizes Chip is not what he says he is, he gives up his charade without even a fight and Tom is the world's biggest hero.

He played the cripple card to the hilt and made everyone feel bad as he tried to manipulate the (insert expletive here) out of everyone.  The ending and other scenes just didn't feel right.  That said, it's worth a look.  MY GRADE: B minus to B; WHEN WATCHED: 10/05/2010.",1286409600,,553,4.525252525252525
2767561,1,B000NDJGTK,"I'm looking at the reviews online and it appears to be a great divide to how this movie should be rated. The positive reviews sound as if the people seen a different movie than I did (which, I guess, in editing and such, could be true).
Tom is an underachiever, working in jobs until he gets fed up and quits. When you see the way the boss treats the workers in his current job, you can completely understand and sympathize with him. Sofia, his wife, is not only a successful lawyer but pregnant. Sofia's plan is to be a stay at home mom while Tom supports the little family.
Of course, this doesn't go well. They move back to Ohio, where his father-in-law gets him a job at the advertising agency where the father-in-law is employed. And what better than having your wife's exboyfriend, a ""handicapable"" man, be your mentor at the new job.
You can probably imagine some funny scenarios, but the writers didn't seem to have that imagination. You know where you're going with this movie, which can be good, but this movie is not worth the journey. Nobody except Tom is likable. And Tom seems more pathetic than likable.
There's a little side story of how Sofia gets into a ""mommy and me"" sort of group where they have some different views on baby raising. Sofia talks about breast feeding, but the costume designers didn't take into account the effect breast feeding has on a woman's body - a larger bust.
But I stopped watching the movie about half way thru it and fast forwarded to the end. The end is predictable, all the cliches are said and it gets neatly tied up in the last scene. No discussions of ""why did you listen to your ex instead of me?"" or ""Maybe this wasn't such a good idea, anyway"".
Unless you are really a fan of Zach Braff or Jason Bateman, I'd advise you to skip this movie.",1283040000,,1795,4.425981873111782
2767562,2,B000NDJGTK,I have always enjoyed anything that Zach Braff touches. His charm and wit has always created wonderful movies and t.v. episodes.

Story may have worked better with just a couple dating instead of a married couple who just recently became parents. The story lines did not seems to flow together.,1279756800,,489,4.632183908045977
2767563,3,B000NDJGTK,"The Ex (directed by Jesse Peretz) is a romantic comedy that induces a few chuckles but ultimately doesn't do its talented cast justice.

Tom Reilly (Zach Braff) is a slacker who can't find a career he loves. When he loses his job as chef the day his wife, Sofia Kowalski (Amanda Peet), has their baby, he is forced to move from New York City to small town Ohio. He reluctantly takes a job at an ad agency where her father (Charles Grodin) works. He meets Chip Sanders (Jason Bateman); a self-absorbed creative consultant who knew Sofia in high school and has an unhealthy crush on her. Tom must learn to survive in the corporate world and against Chip who becomes a rival at work and in his personal life.

The humor is average at best. There are a few moments that are funny but most of the writing lets the cast down. Zach Braff, Amanda Peet and Jason Bateman are talented comedic actors. Even they cannot save this movie from its own mediocre writing.

Braff's character is very one-dimensional. He does redeem himself when he his taking care of his son but most of the time he acts like a screw up who can't get his act together. The ending is promising for his character, though. It makes me believe he might finally get some thing right. But I'm not holding my breath.

Chip Sanders is as evil of a corporate rival as they get. He is sadistic, cruel and there are no qualities in his personality that compels me to like him. I feel this also makes Sanders appear one-dimensional. It would be interesting for him to reveal anything that garners sympathy.

Amy Adams, Fred Armisen, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd are all delightful actors that pop up in the movie. Poehler was great. She leaves me wondering why her character doesn't show up more. She is hilarious with the lines she is given (as are the rest of them). Any excuse to give Poehler more lines and air time would make me happy.",1256256000,,1890,4.466666666666667

There he's made subordinate to an old flame (Donal Logue) of his wife (Amanda Peete) who has been living as a pretend paraplegic in a wheelchair for sympathy. Logue's objective is to drive Zach out of the company and take back up with Amanda; en route he sabotages Zach's new ad campaign idea, and Zach accidentally starts a fire destroying the tape with the compelling ad approach just when it's needed most. To make matters worse, the kid in the ad decides he's not going to record it anymore. The resulting stress causes Zach and Amanda to break up.

Fortunately, despite several additional klutzy moves, Logue exposes himself as an impostor, and goes off to a supposed new position in Barcelona that Zach fakes a job offer to him from. The good news is that Zach's promotional tape is recreated after Amanda talks the young lad into it, Zach finds his calling and starts his own ad agency, and he's reunited with Amanda.",1254096000,,1089,4.666666666666667
2767565,1,B000NDJGTK,"Biggest problem with `The Ex' is that it tries to be a comedy movie but unfortunately all its jokes are highly predictable.  You can sense the punch line as soon as the scene starts.  Too much stress (and most of the `funny' moments) are between Jason Bateman and Zach Braff and movie fails to utilize the comedy timings of Amanda Peet (as evident in `Whole Nine Yards' movies) and Amy Adams (Enchanted).
After spending almost 90 minutes with `The Ex' it still feels like an episode of a regular sitcom.  It looks like filmmakers decided to put together this amazing ensemble cast (Zach Braff. Amanda Peet, Jason Bateman, Mia Farrow, Amy Poehler, Amy Adams and even Paul Rudd) and then just tried to create a script around these characters.  End result was pretty pathetic.
Overall, I think Jason Bateman did a pretty good job with his character.  Amy Adams was amazing in her small role.  One highlight of the movie was Paul Rudd (who was there only for a single scene) and he was simply amazing.  His few minutes of appearance were more memorable then over an hour of Zach Braff.

And yet, ""The Ex"" is not great; it is not even OK, but instead is a lifeless dud.  The first scene sets the mood - an awful, clunky bit of exposition that doesn't even rise to the level of bad TV comedy.  This is bad news, given that Braff is the star of one of TV's best comedies, and Peet was fantastic in the underrated comedy/drama ""Studio 60"".  It just gets worse from there.  I think I was 10 minutes into this before I even chuckled.  The cast tries gamely to work with the terrible script and nonexistent direction, generally to no avail.  Grodin and Farrow fare the best, perhaps because their years of experience has taught them how to deal with clueless directors.

The lighting and camera work are public-access-TV level bad.  I know because I have made movies for public access TV.  I had something on the order of a benjamin to work with.  I don't know how you get the same look with millions of dollars behind you.

The funniest bits of this movie are in the blooper reel in the special features - where the actors actually get to exercise their talents for comedy without being shackled by horrible writing and nonexistent direction.

As an aside, I didn't buy the crazy moms' group in Columbus, Ohio, until my wife reminded me that her best friend (who happens to live in Columbus) had virtually the same experience as Amanda Peet.

It's a shame, as the movie has some funny moments, but it's negated because it's so irritating! Zach Braff plays a likable guy who has no backbone and that is only the tip of the iceberg.

2767570,2,B000NDJGTK,"Writers David Guion and Michael Handelman and director Jesse Peretz must have called in a lot of favors when they made ""The Ex,"" for how else to account for the presence of Zach Braff, Amanda Peet, Jason Bateman, Charles Grodin, Mia Farrow, Amy Poehler, Fred Armisen, Paul Rudd and Amy Adams in as slight an indie comedy as the one they have manufactured here?  And ""manufactured"" is definitely the operative term in this case, for ""The Ex"" feels contrived and phony from the get-go.

After he gets fired from his job as a chef in an upscale Manhattan restaurant, Tom Reilly (Braff) moves with his wife and infant son back to her hometown in Ohio where he gets a job at the same ad agency where his father-in-law (Grodin) works.  One of the employees, Chip (Bateman), an old flame of Tom's wife, Sofia (Peet), tries to sabotage Tom at every turn, undercutting him at work and trying to rekindle the romance between Sofia and himself.

""The Ex"" fails on a variety of levels, but the primary one is that, while it is supposed to be a satire of small town, middle American values, most of the characters - with their New-Age quirkiness and bohemian eccentricities - seem as if they'd be more at home living in some converted loft in Soho than on a tree-lined street in suburban Ohio.  The setting of ""The Ex"" doesn't feel like Anyplace, USA; in fact, it doesn't feel like anyplace, period, except maybe the fantasy world of two overpaid Hollywood screenwriters.  Add to this an assortment of unappealing and unappetizing characters, a tendency towards sitcom-level humor and plotting, and an over-reliance on heavy-handed slapstick and sight gags, and you have one of the major comedy disappointments of 2007.  Braff is definitely a talented actor, but ""The Ex"" is a career path misfire that should be mercifully forgotten.",1197417600,4,1820,4.795527156549521

Amanda Peet is apparently in love with her husband, although she sends out no emotional signals other than her dialogue.

When he tries to get Wesley's help and assaults him, no one but a child abuser could continue to root for his character.  Jason Bateman who was in ""The Break Up"" and ""Mr. Margorium's Wonder Emporium,"" is also one of the worst villains by trying to score points by faking paraplegia, apparently successfully according to the plot.  Charles Grodin looks so much like Amanda Peet that she must have been adopted.  Mia Farrow doesn't do much in this film, but is more interesting that most.

2767575,2,B000NDJGTK,"As much as I love Zach Braff and Amanda Peet, I really thought this movie was a bust.  I would have given it 1 star except for the two of them.  This is a very dark ""comedy,"" and most of the movie is rather depressing as Braff goes from one predicament to another.  You feel sorry for him rather than wanting to laugh.  Jason Bateman's character is really too diabolical for a comedy, and the constant pratfalls are just not funny.  The movie seems to miss its beat somehow.  The concept is sort of cute, a guy whose boss just happens to be his wife's ex, but the movie is more like a foray into an evil and disturbed alternate universe than the side-splitting hilarity I was expecting.  I would not recommend this movie.",1189123200,37,721,4.335820895522388

2767579,4,B000NDJGTK,"I love Zach Braff. Tis the reason my anticipation to see this film was so high. Garden State and The Last Kiss were both amazing movies but I wanted to see him play a character like JD from Scrubs. You know, the kinda wacky, really funny, guy. Enter The Ex.

In no way is this the greatest or funniest movie you'll ever see, let's get that straight right now. And honestly, your enjoyment of this movie will probably be based solely on whether you like Zach Braff or Jason Bateman since they're the primary characters. Everything about this movie is predictable, there's no surprises and I think that that's one of the best things about The Ex. It doesn't try to be something it isn't. However, there isn't that tired 'boy gets girl/boy loses girl/boy gets girl back' scenario which is a good thing.

Tom (Braff) and wife, Sofia (Peet), move to Ohio after their son is born to try and start anew, thanks to a job offer from Sofia's dad. That's when Tom meets Chip (Bateman), a handicapped guy who is gonna be acting as his mentor at the new job. You can guess what happens next and probably be right.

The thing that keeps The Ex funny throughout is far and away Tom and Chip's fued. I'm sure that's why everyone who heard about this movie wanted to see it, and it's just as funny as I thought it'd be. Now you may think differently. Past that, there are some memorable scenes, but only fans of the actors in it are gonna remember this film. Worth the money though.",1188000000,34,1465,4.398523985239852

2767582,1,B000NDJGTK,"Zach Braff, Jason Bateman and Charles Grodin have all been funny on many an occasion.  This film just isn't one of them.  The film does nothing that the viewer does not expect from the previews and has two, maybe three chuckles in it.  It is neither ""Outrageously Funny,"" as Bill Bregoli from Westwood One put it, nor does it contain any ""off-the-wall go-for broke zaniness"" as another reviewer put it(See the DVD cover.).  Overall, it is a story that holds the viewer on edge, waiting for the insanity and laughs to ensue.  Unfortunately, as the end credits role, we may be happy to see the villain get his just desserts, but we find that we didn't laugh much on the way.

2767583,2,B000NDJGTK,"Amusing bits of comedy daub the relatively unoriginal ""The Ex"", which marks director Jesse Peretz' first real Hollywood outing in years. Aspiring comedian Zach Braff portrays a just-shy-of-likeable character that is surrounded by slapstick circumstances and eccentric personas. While the film manages to entertain with a few outrageous gags and peculiar characters, the lack of an original storyline or any unique comedy forces an overwhelmingly mediocre result.

Tom Reilly (Zach Braff) is happily married to Sofia (Amanda Peet) and they're about to have a baby. But the day Sofia gives birth, Zach is fired from his job as a chef. Having a trend of being unable to hold down a job, he convinces Sofia to move to Ohio where he can finally accept a job offer from her father Bob (Charles Grodin). Immediately upon being hired, he meets Chip Sanders (Jason Bateman) who knew Sofia during college. A rivalry starts, and the two struggle to outdo one another at work, frame each other for various screw-ups, and fight for the attention of Sofia and Bob.

Has Hollywood completely lost its ability to devise an original story? It would seem so, as the impertinently titled ""The Ex"" is a confirmation to the unimaginative muck that is continually being churned out. With its banal plot, the events and circumstances that befall our hero also seem peculiarly commonplace. It appears that as each scene unfolds, we're reminded of a similar happening in a different film; as if ""The Ex"" is comprised of stolen tidbits from a dozen other better movies. While some of the jokes and antics are still humorous, even the slapstick feels recycled. The lack of an original story shares the film's downfall with its pathetically predictable characters and resolutions.

Most of the cast are incredibly eccentric and individualistic, but this tends to annoy half of the time and allow for utter predictability the other half. Playing out like clockwork, each of the characters simply falls into place and they go through generic motions. Adding very little amusement to the grand scheme of things, we're left with the classically contemptible plot sorely sticking out.

The acting all around is mediocre at best. Zach Braff seems uncomfortable in his role, and his lines are delivered with uncertainty. The script doesn't give anyone much room to shine, but Zach makes us think he'd rather be somewhere else. Whether the role was written with him in mind or not, he simply doesn't fit. It's a bad sign when the supporting actors are more entertaining than the leads. In this case, the supporting characters leave a longer lasting impression, but only because of their incorrigible annoyingness.

The funniest bits of the film are completely irrelevant slapstick, or abrupt out-of-nowhere gags that don't tie into the story in any way. They are add-on segments that exist solely for laughs. And because of this extramural way of inciting audience interactivity, the PG-13 atmosphere hurts the film. The jokes are stunted and underdeveloped - and while they needn't be repulsive or raunchy, they suffer from their own concern for keeping the subject matter immoderately appropriate.

The unoriginality of the film leads it to ruination. Fans of Zach Braff might be entertained, but only because of his presence. The acting falls short, not that we expected much, and the humor is ill-contrived at best. Overall, the film screams of mediocrity like several other recent filmmaking attempts that beg to be left alone in the corner of the video rental store.

2767584,3,B000NDJGTK,"After the massive successes of Garden State and Scrubs, Zach Braff became a household name. Studio execs deemed him officially capable of headlining a movie, but apparently he just can't do it successfully. The Ex only took in a meager $3 million at the US Box office, and that's with costars like Amanda Peet (Saving Silverman, Something's Gotta Give) and Jason Bateman (Arrested Development). Not to mention a supporting cast that includes Charles Grodin, Mia Farrow, Donal Logue, Amy Poehler, Amy Adams, Fred Armisen, and an unmentioned Paul Rudd cameo. The film was released theatrically on May 11th, and now only three months later (August 21st), it's already making its DVD appearance. Even in our 21st century, fast-paced world, that's quick turnaround. With a track record like that, audience expectations can be set pretty low.

What's interesting, though, is that The Ex doesn't live down to low expectations. It's got a solid cast, a solid story, and some pretty decent comedy gags. The three leads (Braff, Peet, and Bateman) are all known for superb comedic timing and deliver in every scene. Braff and Peet connect as a believable couple, the plot never feels stagnant or unoriginal, and the laugh out loud moments just seem to keep coming. Paul Rudd appears early on in a hilarious cameo as Braff's peevish boss, and the tone is set for the movie to take off. Charles Grodin, best known as the father in the Beethoven movies, makes a triumphant return to the screen after a decade-long hiatus. For the next hour or so, comedy fans will be wallowing in the heaven of unexpected laughs and outrageous gags as Bateman, Braff, and Peet expertly deliver the comic goods.  The film seems to be heading for an equally clever finale when suddenly everything is derailed: the comedy train breaks down and the story is lost... so what happened?

Here's a quick plot breakdown: Braff is a chef. Peet is a lawyer. They're married. They live in New York. Peet is pregnant. Braff gets fired. They move back to Ohio where he works for her dad's ad agency. He discovers that his coworker (Bateman) is obsessed with his wife and trying to sabotage his job. He fights back. Hilarity ensues. Curtain.

Not exactly the easiest story to market. The trailers make the film out to look like a slaphappy husband vs. ex-boyfriend in a wheelchair comedy mash. Unfunny clips that don't appear in the movie are thrown in, entire scenes are played out, and yet the audience still isn't sure what they're going to see. To be fair to promoters, The Ex doesn't exactly lend itself to easy marketing.  And it seems like the producers may have realized this 3/4ths of the way through production. After about 70 minutes, the story suddenly hits fast forward and everything happens at once, ending the movie at a mere 80 minutes, and leaving the audience feeling like they got treated to the quickest wrap up in film history. The three alternate endings, alternate opening, and slew of deleted scenes included on the disc speak volumes to the way this film must have been picked over and processed by the studio. The opening scenes are poorly filmed and almost feel like a different film and the same can be said for the finale. But the hour or so in between is built entirely in the world of hilarious light romantic comedy.

In all the bloopers, and even on IMDB, the film is still listed as Fast Track. And it seems that this project got fast tracked off the studio lot and into theatres before director Jesse Peretz, former bassist for The Lemonheads, was ready to let it go. Then again, maybe he never had much interest in the film to begin with, or maybe writing team David Guion and Michael Handelman didn't give him enough to work with. As the Tootsie Roll Pop commercial states: ""The World May Never Know."" Whatever the case, The Ex is a clear example of a first-rate comedy getting pounded down into a quick mindless 80 minute studio writeoff. For audiences looking for 80 minutes of light-hearted, surprisingly delightful, comfortably off-color comedy, look no further. Just don't expect the beginning, middle, and end to connect.",1187308800,,4119,4.802538787023978
