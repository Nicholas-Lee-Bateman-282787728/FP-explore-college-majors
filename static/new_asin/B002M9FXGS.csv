8373688,5,B002M9FXGS,"For Spencer fans this is a great movie to add to the collection, along with the first Piedone movie as well as Flatfood in HongKong.  This movie begins in Naples and ends up in Namibia (South West Africa at time of filming).  The flow of the movie is its outstanding feature, never pausing or relenting on following the storyline and theme.  Little Bodo, Spencer's tiny sidekick in the movie is adorable and steals many scenes.  Naturally, Spencer's Barney Fife like deputy adds ridiculous humor and frustrating turns to the scenes as he does in all the Piedone movies.  The audience finds Spencer piloting his own 'plane, and as usual, being extraordinarily resilient and resourceful in all situations.  A really good addition to any Spencer movie collection.",1309564800,2,760,4.992063492063492
8373689,3,B002M9FXGS,"Piedone l'africano - FLATFOOT IN AFRICA (1978) with Bud Spencer
(real name, Carlo Pedersoli), is a European cultural milestone, at
least in cinema and comedy is concerned.

Anyone having resided in any of Roman-influenced countries in the
1980's and earlier, will have seen a litany of these comedies
playing at the theaters, most often with Terence Hill and not just
Bud Spencer, and other ones, such as Bruce Lee, and a number of
American productions from a decade earlier.

Indeed, this work is categorized as a comedy for kids and
teenagers, but also as family entertainment, as nothing is remotely
offensive to anyone, whether it's language, behavior,  scenarios,
etc.

The quality of the filming is over and above what is required from
professionals in the business, still holding up very well in 30
years later, and is an important ingredient in maintaining the
audience's interest.

The story, although loosely weaved as occurring between Naples, IT
and Johannesburg, South Africa, is not a liability.

The lighter moments  occur naturally and precisely because they are
not over-rehearsed, overdone or isolated, work very well time and
again.

For the audience with a greater taste for adventure and letting
loose, Spencer, playing a detective investigating an international
narcotics smuggling operation in crates of various commodities,
infiltrates a diamond operation open pit mine and a series of
scuffles ensue. Type-cast as a tough guy, Spencer's body to body
combats, of all types, executed to perfection, without any
computerized animation often seen in modern studios.

As is often the case with B-movies, the backdrop also serves as a
time capsule, as various filming locations  are shown, ranging from
restaurants, downtown nightlife, port container offloading cranes,
the dunes seen in some parts of South Africa, etc.

Finally, not be overlooked, is the use of animals to underline
lighter moments, such as a parrot sounding a phrase the outcome of
which is the bad guy dropping a weapon, or chimpanzees applauding,
ostrich's observing gunplay, etc.

This one has replay value, and the soundtrack's goal, as well, is
to change the mood of the audience, as well.",1271376000,2,2183,5.241379310344827
