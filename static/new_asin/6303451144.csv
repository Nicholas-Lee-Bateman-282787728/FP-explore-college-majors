647359,5,6303451144,"I am so very ""fond"" of this movie !  I was seven when I first saw The Legend of the Lone Ranger. Me and  my brother watched it over and over and over again, we never got tired of it. Thus the entire aspect of the movie,  especially the soundtrack and narration stir up pleasant memories of my  childhood, sounds strange I know but because we'd get it out every so often  from the video club, until I was about ten, I grew to know it so well.
I  won't bother to explain what the movie is about because the other reviewers  have done that already but I'd like to add that this is more of a  children's movie than an adults movie, adults can certainly enjoy it too  but that depends on weather or not adults want to put away their cynical  side for the duration of the movie.
I saw the Lone Ranger as an adult a  decade later on TV, when I was in University far away from home and I  really had to smile, it was comforting in a way to see and hear the story  especially the beautiful scene where the Lone Ranger tames Silver. This  movie got trashed by critics but SO WHAT. I have watched some so called  Oscar worthy stuff and thought to myself :""What utter nonsensical garbage ""
This is a movie that I know I can let my children watch one day. I was  at such an impressionable age at the time that I watched this movie it  single-handedly instilled alot of respect in me for the Native American  people.  That's a very worthy achievement.",955238400,16,1437,4.16
647360,4,6303451144,"How would you like being asked, in your first film ever, to star in a re-make of a beloved television classic, to suffer through the disjointed efforts of six (count 'em, six) modestly talented screenwriters, to have  your own voice dubbed, and to be harrangued during filming by a former  television star who played your role in the 1950s? If Klinton Spilsbury had  been short or ugly, the critics would undoubtedly cut him more slack. His  career never recovered from this piling on, but two scenes in the film  could well one day be seen as classics. See the film and you'll immediately  know which two.",949795200,7,606,4.669811320754717

  PLOT SUMMARY:

  ""A FIRERY HORSE, A CLOUD OF DUST, AND A HEARTY HI-YO SILVER. THE LONE RANGER. WITH HIS FAITHFUL INDIAN COMPANION TONTO, THE DARING AND RESOURCEFUL MASKED RIDER OF THE PLAINS, LED THE FIGHT FOR LAW AND ORDER IN THE EARLY WESTERN UNITED STATES. NOWHERE IN THE PAGES OF HISTORY, CAN ONE FIND A GREATER CHAMPION OF JUSTICE. RETURN WITH US NOW TO THOSE THRILLING DAYS OF YESTERYEAR. FROM OUT OF THE PAST COME THE THUNDERING HOOFBEATS OF THE GREAT HORSE SILVER. THE LONE RANGER RIDES AGAIN!""

  In the Old West, legends loomed larger than life. And none more so than the Lone Ranger. Orphaned as a child, John Reid befriends Tonto, an Indian boy. Years later, Reid returns to the West as a lawyer devoted to brining justice to the lawless land. However, the murderous Cavendish gang that killed his parents wound him in an ambush that leaves his Texas Ranger brother dead.

  After being nurtured back to health by Tonto, Reid dons the now-famous mask to pursue justice anonymously. So when the Cavendish gang kidnaps President Ulysses S. Grant, it leads to a reckoning between them and the ""Lone Ranger"" in this big-budget, action-packed western epic saga.

  Trivia: John Hart (Lucas Striker) spent 1 year (1952-1953) behind the mask in the classic TV western series ""THE LONE RANGER"" (ABC-TV. September 12, 1949-September 12, 1957)",944438400,8,2268,5.767080745341615

647572,3,6303451144,"Well this film sure receives its share of damnation. Seems mostly to be regarding the dvd transfer, but if it wasn't a blockbuster you have to expect minimal care to go into it.
I'm no die hard Ranger buff or Western religioso, and have always found the film to be enjoyable. Moves along at a nice clip and everything seems all-around 'sufficient' enough to not make me want my time back after watching it.
The picture quality I wouldn't by any means call atrocious, but maybe some folks in this superficial fast food culture we're in just can't handle anything short of HD. At any rate, I've seen worse. I'd recommend to someone who isn't uptight about everything to watch it at least once.",1474502400,2,691,4.580645161290323

647678,4,6303451144,"The movie its self is one of my all time favorite from my youth. The cover however was torn and the case was cracked. I've waited forever for it to hit DVD and thought it would never reach Blu Ray as it didn't sell well for whatever reason, so I didn't put up a fit over it it is what it is I guess.. Its weird that they dubbed his voice maybe if they just let him act it would of done better. I think the story fits really well with the original material and was entertaining both when I was younger and today. I don't see what anyone could possibly want more of? He's the Lone Friggin Ranger for crying out loud. People say it took too long to reveal him well what about that pile of dung Johnny did? It was just silly all around but everyone loved it because it starred him. I'm sorry, but the drunken/dumb act is worn out...!",1464393600,,829,4.060975609756097

647874,1,6303451144,"The script is boring, the direction is terrible, and the very few action scenes are on the
order of a D. W. Griffith two-reeler. There was an interesting idea in bonding the Ranger and
Tonto as kids, but that's the only successful aspect. Christopher Lloyd, so picturesque as the
crazy dude in the TV series Taxi, is an empty shell as the villain. One of the worst films of
all time.",1446076800,,383,4.408450704225352

647876,4,6303451144,"This version was the best movie about the Lone Ranger ever made. Great story with fine acting. I believe it was originally a made for television movie that was made into a DVD. The picture quality at the very beginning is a little rough, but it gets better quickly.  It features great acting by Christopher Lloyd and Merle Haggard does the background commentaries for the second half of the movie and sings the theme song at the very end. The only thing I don't like about this movie is that it really drags when the Lone Ranger is trying to train Silver, his horse. It lasts for a long 10 minutes.",1445385600,,598,4.387387387387387
647877,4,6303451144,Great film in the Lone Ranger franchise. Highly overlooked because of the off production nonsense. I remembered seeing this as a kid and enjoyed it.,1444521600,,148,4.96

647881,5,6303451144,"For those of you who watched the movie when it came to screens in 1981, this is nostalgia. And those of you who were fans of the character know his prowess with guns, explosives, disguises, legal knowledge and languages. All of that is seen here in this movie where the Ranger and Tonto rescue President Grant and bring down the Cavendish Gang. Unlike too many iconic characters whose comic origins were screwed up by Hollywood script tampering, THE LEGEND OF THE LONE RANGER did a faithful job with the story and characters of the frontier West.",1443312000,,546,4.697916666666667
648042,5,6303451144,"This is a great movie adaptation, the story is good, well written, flows nicely, the acting is great. My only complaint is the volume quality, which is a bit low, I have turn the volume up a lot to hear it well. This Lone Ranger movie is far better than the 2013 remake.",1442966400,,270,4.113207547169812

648046,5,6303451144,"My opinion, this movie brings back very good memories for me. Compared to the latest version (Johnny Depp) The Legend Of The Lone Ranger is a cult classic! I will not argue with other people who say Clayton Moore IS THE LONE RANGER, they are 100% correct. I like the plot, the script and the surroundings of the movie. You appreciate it towards the end when the gates explode of the Cavendish hide out, and the Calvary storms a head with the US Flag waving high, with Silver and Scout at the head of the pack.  Great to finally see it on Blu Ray (fantastic picture AND in widescreen). 5 Stars.",1439942400,2,593,4.342342342342342

648051,4,6303451144,"Actually much better than the Johnny Depp plays an Indian version (which appropriately tanked at the box office and with critics). It's hokey, but so was the TV series, which made it fun to watch.",1437782400,,196,4.628571428571429
648164,5,6303451144,One of the most underrated movies ever. And 100 times better than that mess Jonny Depp foisted on us.  This version is about a real hero.  Klinton Spilsbury and Michael Horse make a great team as the Lone Ranger & Tonto. So happy to have this on widescreen Blu-ray.  John Barry's score is also wonderful.,1437696000,4,304,4.490909090909091
648165,4,6303451144,"Aw, come on! It's not Macbeth, it's the Lone Ranger! Give this film a break and a viewing. It holds true to the Clayton Moore/Jay Silverheels TV show and then some.",1437523200,4,164,4.32258064516129
648166,3,6303451144,"I bought this film, not because it is a good film, but because it contains some of the worst acting and dialogue of any version of the Lone Ranger legend.

648307,1,6303451144,"So this has now been released on blu-ray, presumably in an effort to make the more recent Johnny Depp/Armie Hammer LONE RANGER look good. Which, to be fair, it really does. Star Klinton Spilsbury (whose lines had to be dubbed by another actor) never worked in a film again, though I remember hearing Bo Derek had planned to co-star him in a film - but that was scrapped when this one, and her Razzie-winning Bolero both bombed. The director also never directed another film, though he was successful as a cinematographer and directed some tv episodes. Michael Horse (Tonto) and Christopher Lloyd (Butch Cavendish) both went on to bigger and better things, though 'better' couldn't have been difficult. The most memorable thing about this movie is that it was the subject of a joke at the Oscars: ""the scene where Tonto sticks his ear to the ground and says, ""Kemosabe, I can hear six people coming to see this movie, tops."" Do yourself a favour and don't be one of them.",1429315200,,970,4.678362573099415

I know in the description full screen but when there is no other buying options you buy what there is and full screen is very disappointing in this day and age, Second the picture and sound quality is that of bad VHS transfer with a very grainy and gritty picture and  where in one scene there was massive digitization, It's like Lions Gate just took a bad VSH copy and made a bunch of bad DVDs, As for Specials features there are none not even a trailer.

What many of you may not know, is there was a huge controversy with the film producers and Clayton Moore.
Clayton was still making guest appearances as the Lone Ranger, and the producers who had bought the rights to the character, wanted all attention on their film and Klinton Spilsbury.  They prevented Clayton from appearing in public  wearing his mask.  He was Parade Marshal of the West Allis Western Days, and appeared in costume, but wearing dark sunglasses instead.  While the Legend Of The Lone Ranger isn't a terrible movie, it is far more believable than the over the top, ridiculous action scenes in the Johnny Depp film.  But to me (in my 60's) Clayton Moore will always be my choice for the Lone Ranger.",1404604800,,982,4.5141242937853105

The print is distractingly bad and it is pan and scan full screen. The film has enough wrong with it without detracting from it further with an inferior presentation... I just don't understand why Lionsgate didn't at least dig up a decent print - no one is suggesting they restore the thing but at least give us the correct aspect ration etc. It's a shame because the movie holds find memories for a lot of people who saw this growing up. If this didn't get a decent treatment when the Disney film was released last year it likely never will. Based on the lackluster performance of both LOTLR and last years LR I would say that this character may never rise to prominance again - so it would be nice to get this film in a decent print so we can enjoy what there is...

As to the film itself? Strange movie. Definitely not a good film but interesting. You had to have seen this as a kid to be able to enjoyt it. Watching this for the first time as an adult would be a mistake. Just the idiotic rhyming voice overs is enough to drive you away. Not to mention Clinton Spilsbury, how poorly he pulls off the cotume, and how badly his lines are dubbed. How boring Christopher Lloyd is as Cavendish. How outlandish the plot is. The fact that the Lone Ranger is only in the film for 25 minutes or so - the rest is origin story - and not all that captivating origin story... just an odd film and not a very good one BUT if you saw this as a kid go for it - but just know that the print and presentation stinks",1403654400,,1651,4.175548589341693

Clayton rarely if ever appeared in public unmasked after doing the series. During the time of the court injunction Clayton appeared in mask-shaped sunglasses.

649044,3,6303451144,"It had been many years since I had seen this movie, but it was just as I had remembered it: the things that I liked about it were still just as good, and the things that I liked it in spite of were still just as bad!

First the bad: much of the dialog in this movie is awful - really, REALLY awful! And even worse than the dialog is the monologue (voice-over narration). Klinton Spilsbury got really bad reviews for his performance as the title character, but I think that part of what he got the blame for were the lines that he was given to deliver. His character was not one that I could develop much interest in, much less attachment to, and Tonto (Michael Horse) was not much better. The movie made some attempt at being respectful of the Native American Characters and Culture, but they still came across (to me at least) as being very Anglo-fied (although in fairness, this was still the 70s, and Hollywood's portrayal of native peoples was still, shall we say, in the early stages of its evolution.)

What saves this movie for me, and in fact makes it one that I enjoy watching, are the supporting characters. Jason Robards' portrayal of President Grant was interesting and believable, without being heavy-handed, or taking himself too seriously. I enjoyed Christopher Lloyd as Butch Cavandish (the primary villain), probably now more than I originally had. Lloyd does quirky, psychotic villains as well as anybody, and brings some subtle depth to what are otherwise two-dimensional characters. Again, he doesn't take himself too seriously, while portraying a character who very obviously does! These two seem to have done much better in the lottery for dialog writers among the movie's seven (!) credited writers.

I'm sorry both this movie and the new one with Armie Hammer were so poorly received. They are both terrific in their own way.

Bowling for movies is the brain flower (a new term I just coined) of me, just your average dude, who has taken on the heavy task of developing a system to accurately score Hollywood magic.

While this system has everything to do with home entertainment it literally has nothing to do with bowling.

The Legend of the Lone Ranger - we unfortunately own the DVD

What the movie is about:
People familiar with the radio and early TV show will recognize the story of the left for dead but nursed back to health by a native american fellow who becomes the masked man nobody (even people close to him) seem to be able to identify.  If you're not familiar OH BOY don't make the mistake of owning this miss-fire - do yourself a favor and watch the original campy TV show.

What I like:
Literally NOTHING - this movie is the first movie I have reviewed that I couldn't find SOMETHING to like.  It was simply terrible from start to finish.

What I didn't like:
The script is terrible, the plot twists are predictable, the acting was so bad they had to DUB OUT the lone rangers voice and use another actor, the quality of the picture suggests the soft lens was much loved but come on now - it looks like a 6th generation VHS copy, and it drags on forever before the credits finally roll and put the story out of it's misery.

649275,4,6303451144,"for starters, any way ya slice it, ""legend"" is an overstatement. the film is actually pretty understated and low-key. there's nothing wrong with that, but it no doubt surprised some at the time, not least of which because the film was probably made in response to the epic Superman films. by modern standards the plot is pretty straightforward and un-gimmicky.
(interestingly, the recent Lone Ranger film, starring Armie Hammer and Johnny Depp, is being largely criticized for going to the other extreme of being too epic, of too much happening.)
and of course there's the fact that film bombed, to say the least. it got a few ""razzies."" although to be fair, one of those, declaring the theme song ""The Man In The Mask"" worst original song, was all too deserved.
but for all that, the film is a more pleasant experience than it's reputation would lead you to believe. it's ""star,"" Klinton Spilsbury, may not quite measure up to Clayton Moore or Brace Beemer (from the original radio series), but he's still just engaging enough to get the job done. the major stigma, the inherent black-eye on the film, seems to be Spilsbury, based mostly on the fact that he never appeared in another film. that's actually kind of shame, because Spilsbury did have some degree of talent. it's not that he hurt the film any, it's that he lost the Hollywood lottery.
he's aided by a pretty good cast. his Tonto is played by one Michael Horse, who works pretty well once you get passed the lack Jay Silverheels-esque spoonerism. Jason Robards, in what effectively adds  up to a ""special guest star"" role, is a creditable if unremarkable Ulysses S. Grant.
one John Hart briefly appears as a newspaper editor. Hart's claim to lasting fame - as dubious as Spilsbury's - is having played the backup Lone Ranger on the tv series for a year whilst Clayton Moore was having a salary dispute. although i daresay some will cease to find that particularly cool when they inevitably start to wonder why Clayton Moore couldn't put in a similar appearance. well as it happens, one Jack Wrather, who owned the property at the time, and Moore were having some legal issues, and Moore was forbidden to have anything to do with The Lone Ranger until they were straightened out.
(some might ask the same question about Jay Silverheels. given that he'd just died, i'd say it was health issues in his case.)
the oddest bit of casting is Christopher Lloyd as the Ranger's nemesis, Major ""Butch"" Cavendish. not only is this a rather radical reimagining, converting the character from rambunctious ""owlhoot"" outlaw to discreditted Army officer, but Lloyd is cast against type, to put it mildly. the man best known as ""Reverend"" Jim Ignatowski and ""Doc"" Emmett Brown will no doubt shock some in the role of such an understated, almost Machiavellian antagonist. but don't let anyone tell you he's not up to the task. i've heard that every actor has abilities and characterizations they probably won't have an opportunity to display, particularly those who manage to get typecast. Lloyd's performance here demonstrates the all too literal truth of that assessment.
by an interesting twist of Fate, the film is a bit of a milestone. as originally conceived on radio, The Lone Ranger was every bit the ""man of mystery"" and as such given no secret identity whatsoever. it was gradually, over a handful of years, that they developed the backstory of the sole survivor of an ambushed posse of Texas Rangers, and how their leader just happened to be his elder brother, with a son named Dan Reid out there somewhere. this turn of events couldn't help but force the surname Reid onto our hero, but primary writer Fran Striker insisted, so as to retain at least some degree of that original mystery, that he never be given a first name. so it was from this movie that he finally received a ""given"" Christian name, although it's rather a drag that they'd hand him a bland, prosaic name like John. oh, well.
to summarize, it's another case of the major recurring theme in my reviews, the critically panned commercial failure of a film that turns out not to suck after all. i'm beginning to think i'll never run out of 'em...",1375142400,9,4168,4.764868603042877

649278,1,6303451144,"Actually, the full name, ""The Legend of the Lone Ranger"" is too cumbersome... Like many other elements in this classic misfire, everything is too cumbersome. The music is awkward, the dialogue is absolutely dreadful and the voice-over is in verse (?!?). Only one statement in the script resonates with me: ""In Texas, robbers are outlaws; in Washington D.C., robbers are elected."" This tells me nothing much has changed over the years.

Scripted by a committee chaired by Ivan Goff and Ben Roberts, this cringe-worthy mess was directed by William A. Fraker (Lots of TV)...may their names go down in infamy....

Here are the on-screen culprits/victims (take your pick):
  * Klinton Spilsbury is John Reid/Lone Ranger, the idealistic lawyer who wants to see Justice brought to Texas. (This is Spilsbury's only film. After it wrapped he went to Europe, did some modeling, then became an acting coach in Vancouver, B.C.)
  * Michael Horse (Lots of TV and voice work) is Tonto, Reid's friend and blood brother since childhood.
  * John Bennett Perry (""Independence Day"") is Captain Dan Reid, our hero's brother. He feels he is fighting a losing battle...and he is.
  * Christopher Lloyd (Lots of TV and voice work) is Butch (short for ""Butcher"") Cavendish, the bible-toting villain of the piece.
  * Richard Farnsworth (""The Straight Story"") is Wild Bill Hickok, the well-known gunman riding in the presidential train and playing poker with the president.
  * Jason Robards (""Magnolia"") is President Ulysses S. Grant, who comes campaigning to Texas.
  * Juanin Clay (""WarGames"" she died of a heart ailment at age 46) is Amy Striker, the idealistic young journalist who has attracted the attention of our hero.

There is a startling amount of profanity, along with deaths by hanging, shooting, stabbing and a firing squad, so the PG rating surprises me, but then again, maybe the MPAA decided no one would go see this black hole, so the rating wouldn't matter. And it IS only 98 minutes long!

Nominated for numerous Razzie Awards and a winner for Worst Actor, Worst Script and Worst New Actor, we'll just let the work speak for itself. It's clear that Klinton Spilsbury is handsome, personable and charming, so it's sad to see that in his first (and only) time out the gate he got mixed up with this bunch. I lived in the same hometown as Spilsbury when he was a child, so I had to have this in my collection; I got it from Amazon.",1374192000,2,2425,4.844660194174757

649281,4,6303451144,"I've read so many reviews saying that Legend Of The Lone Ranger is horrible that I was actually starting to believe it. I hadn't seen it since the 1980's when HBO would show it all the time so I decided to watch it again. Much to my suprise it's still just as cool, respectful and loyal to the Lone Ranger as I remembered it being.

I just saw the 2013 Disney version, the original 1949 Enter The Lone Ranger and The Legend Of The Lone Ranger all in the same week. This movie is very cool, and in many ways it's my favorite of the three versions. It has a tight 1:40 minute runtime with the first hour entirely devoted to John Reid growing up and eventually losing his brother, while the final 40 minutes give you 100% pure Lone Ranger and Tonto in action. Beatifully shot by Lazlo Kovacks (Easy Rider) with all the epic scope and sunsets you would expect from a western. Many of the scenes in this film were VERY similiar to the new Disney version (did Gore Verbinski or the writers watch Legend Of The Lone Ranger recently?).

It seems most of the venom towards this film comes from ""Baby Boomers"" who never got over Clayton Moore being sued in 1981 by the Legend Of The Lone Ranger's production company. Move on. This is a much tighter and less campy movie than the 1949 or 2013 version and gives you the version of the Ranger that every kid wants to be. He's an amazing shot (he uses his guns a lot), looks great in the costume and brings swift justice to Cavendish and his gang. Tonto is awesome in this as well and he definately looks the part. When the William Tell Overture kicks in for the first time (about 60 minutes in) and the Ranger and Tonto go riding off to find Cavendish, I feel like I'm 12 years old again. Those kinds of scenes are pure cinema and the reason we go to the movies in the first place (the Tonto rescue is also a fantastic moment).

This fullscreen version is ""ok"" but so much of the amazing cinematography is cropped during the pan & scan process. The resolution on this dvd is MUCH better than vhs quality (as some claim) but it certainly doesn't do this film justice. The Dolby mono sound is tolerable at best when cranked up.

649392,3,6303451144,"I was 7 years old when this movie came out.  An ardent fan of the Lone Ranger, this movie was shear delight to me when I saw it for the first time back in the early 80's.  It was only once I was an adult that I learned what a terrible flop it was at the box office, and how generally hated it was among critics and fans.  I am surprised by the passionate spewing of projectile hatred people are so intent on launching on behalf of this film.  I would like to go on record to say it is NOT as bad as others would lead you to believe.

THE GOOD

The setting.  The locations are breath-taking.  Westerns at their best showcase the rugged American natural frontier like no other film genre.  The Legend of the Lone Ranger is no exception.  It is simply beautiful.

The tone.  Unlike the new Disney film, this version of the character stays faithful to the sober, heroic depiction of the Ranger we love from Clayton Moore's days in the mask.  The film depicts a realistic, grounded world with brutal, gun-slinging villains that the Lone Ranger is tasked to tame while holding to a higher ideal.  The writers also remain fairly true to the original character mandates that were established back in the radio days.

The cast.  With the exception of Klinton Spilsbury (ironically the Lone Ranger, himself) the cast really shines.  Michael Horse gives what I believe to be the strongest presentation of Tonto to date - with all respect to Mr. Silverheels and no offense to Mr. Depp.  Horse portrays an intelligent, well spoken brother to the Lone Ranger, as opposed to the somewhat subjugated sidekick of the TV series.  He plays the conscience and guide for the Lone Ranger.  Christopher Lloyd is wonderful in any part, and brings a rather strange dignity to the otherwise savage character of Cavendish.  Jason Robards makes a fantastic President Grant.  The scene between Lloyd and Robards is absolutely wonderful.  It should be noted that while Klinton Spilsbury brings little depth to his part, and though his over-dubbed voice makes him sound like he's always in the other room, he certainly looks the part. And one must give him credit for that.  His is a commanding looking Lone Ranger.

The action.  If you are a fan of a good old fashioned western shoot-out, then you should be pleased here.  There is plenty of gun-play with six-shooters, rifles and shotguns.  The action pieces are well staged, which include fantastic stunt work featuring none other than ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" veteran Terry Leonard.  It's an action packed romp to be sure.

THE BAD

Klinton Spilsbury.  Klinton Spilsbury's performance ranges from weak to simply awful.  He often looks like a cardboard cut-out in his scenes.  Michael Horse easily steals the screen from him (without ever even trying).  Thankfully for Spilsbury, the part of the Lone Ranger doesn't require a lot of expression.  It's the only saving grace in his performance.

The story.  The story hits all the important points about the origin of the masked rider without giving him a compelling problem to deal with.  He has barely had time to get sweat marks on his mask before the entire conflict is resolved and the credits are rolling.  There just needed to be more plot development after the introduction of the Lone Ranger.  The movie lands right at the one hour mark before we see the mask and then there are scarcely 30 minutes left of his adventure.  It's just out of balance.  His journey to becoming the Lone Ranger is engaging, so the hour doesn't drag along, but the film would have benefited from a little more expansion after the one hour mark, pushing it toward 2 hours instead just under 100 minutes.

The narration.  This is as atrocious as it is unnecessary.  While the filmmakers appear to be going for the old cowboy poet approach, it simply comes across as insulting to the audience.

Conclusion.  Having said all of that, I still really enjoy this movie.  I had the opportunity recently to watch it with my 13 year old daughter who also thoroughly enjoyed it, so it's not just the nostalgia talking.  With all its flaws, it's a fun way to spend an hour and a half.  I hope that if nothing else good comes from the new Disney movie, that we'll get a proper 16x9 blu-ray release of this film.

649396,4,6303451144,"I remember The Legend of the Lone Ranger from my childhood vividly.  I also remember the controversy surrounding the film and why, to this day, it has remained mostly forgotten and buried and seldom seen on cable or anywhere else.

The controversy stems from the fact that producer Jack Wrather had filed an injunction against actor Clayton Moore who portrayed the original Lone Ranger on television prohibiting him from wearing his mask for public appearances because they were afraid it would cause confusion and take away from the hype surrounding their film. Moore was forced to change his costume and wear wrap-around sunglasses instead of the trademarked mask.  This outraged a LOT of Baby Boomers who grew up watching the Clayton Moore&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Lone-Ranger/dp/B00005UWA8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Lone Ranger</a>&nbsp;TV show and were loyal fans who vehemently boycotted this film.  As a result, the film was a critical and financial box-office bomb.

The other thing I remember vividly about this film was how violent it was for a then PG rated film (this was still 3 years before the PG-13 rating was instigated).  I will never forget the brutal massacre of the Texas Rangers by Butch Cavendish's outlaw gang in the canyons.  It was very graphic and very Peckinpah-esque.

And I loved it.  It was my introduction to the Masked Man and Tonto.  I must have seen it at least 6 times in the theater that summer.  I was 9 years old and innocently naive to the controversy this film had caused.  I had all of the action figures and horses that were produced by Gabriel Toys and the movie sparked my interest to watch the Saturday morning Lone Ranger&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-New-Adventures-of-the-Lone-Ranger-and-Zorro/dp/B000XUF6MY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The New Adventures of the Lone Ranger and Zorro</a>&nbsp;cartoon produced by Filmation.

It also features Christopher Lloyd in a rare dramatic role as a diabolical villain and also one of the more memorable John Barry (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dances-with-Wolves/dp/B0001CCY7E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dances with Wolves</a>) scores I've ever heard.

Who was that Masked Man anyway?  Well he was played by Klinton Spilsbury but his voice was badly dubbed over by actor James Keach, brother of actor Stacy Keach.  Incidently, Spilsbury never acted again after this film was his one and only starring role which was met with such critical disdain as well as his reputation for being mostly combative with cast and crew on-set.  Tonto was played by Michael Horse known mostly from the popular cult television program Twin Peaks.

After decades of being seemingly forgotten and buried I am amazed that this film was finally released on DVD but after reading some reviews of the poor transfer I am not surprised at all that this film has been given such a shoddy transfer.  I am hoping interest in Disney's new Lone Ranger movie with Johnny Depp will spark at least some renewed interest in this film and perhaps a possible Blu-ray release but not very likely.  If you have any curiosity about the Lone Ranger at all after seeing the new film, it's worth watching at least once.

Fraker's lame western ""The Legend of the Lone Ranger"" with a wooden Klinton Spilsbury cast as the Masked Man. Spilsbury is a tall, lean gent with a strong chin and a dashing profile, but he radiates little sense of presence. Not only is this western an origins epic establishing the genesis of the Lone Ranger, but it is also an abduction opus as the hero must rescue President Ulysses S. Grant from Major Bartholomew 'Butch' Cavendish (Christopher Lloyd) who captures his train. When he see the Lone Ranger the first time, he is
an adolescent named John Reid who saves a young Tonto from a gang of killers. Later, when he has grown up, he visits his brother, Captain Dan Reid, and they ride off in pursuit of the gunmen that hanged a newspaper publisher (John Hart of ""The Lone Ranger"")in Del Rio, Texas. The ambush at Bryant's Gap is staged with gusto. Flying wagons filled
with explosives cut the Rangers off in the pass and prevent them from escaping while Cavendish's army of riflemen cut them down. Cavendish is no longer an ordinary outlaw but a former U.S. Army officer court-martialed and turned out of the military. This movie died at the box office partially because of a misguided public relations campaign that stripped the original Lone Ranger Clayton Moore of his mask. Particularly objectionable is the reliance upon a balladeer (country singer Merle Haggard) to provide musical narration. Basically, Haggard tells us what has already happened. The finale with the Lone Ranger and Tonto infiltrating Cavendish hidden fort is explosive stuff. The screenplay includes historical figures like Buffalo Bill Cody, Wild Bill Hickok and General George A. Custer. Jason Robards is good as Grant, but the story is formulaic. If you didn't know any better, ""The Legend of the Lone Ranger"" might make a tolerable rainy day movie. Michael Horse plays Tonto, but the two generate no sense of camaraderie. ""Your sins will be paid for in the fires of hell,"" proclaims Grant when he sentences Cavendish to prison. He could have been referring to the idiots who took away Clayton Moore's mask and came up with this oater. Stacy Keach's younger brother James dubbed Klinton Spilsbury's dialogue, but not even he can cry ""Hi, Yo-Silver"" with any enthusiasm. I grew up watching Clayton Moore and Jay Silverheels ride across the small screen as well as the big screen in ""The Lone Ranger"" and ""The Lone Ranger and the Lost City of Gold,"" and both of these outings surpass this technically gorgeous looking sagebrusher.

Micheal Horse is splendid as Tonto.  The supporting cast, including Juanin Clay as the Ranger's romantic interest Amy (who's given the surname Striker in a tip of the hat to Fran Striker, the writer who had the most influence on the character over the years), John Perry as the Ranger's older brother, the doomed Texas Ranger Captain Dan Reid, Jason Robards as President Grant, and particularly Christopher Lloyd in a chilling performance as Butch Cavendish, are all fine.  The photogrpahy is beautiful.  It's a wonderful rendition of a familiar story.

All of that said, it must be admitted that Klinton Spilbury is a disappointment as the title character.  While he looks the part, he simply hasn't the charisma of past rangers like Moore, Brace Beemer, Lee Powell, Robert Livingston, and even John Hart (who makes a cameo appearance in this film as Amy's uncle, the editor of the local newspaper).  And apparently his voice was so inappropriate it had to be dubbed.  It's no accident that this was the only movie he ever made.

But the rest of the film is so good, it carries Spilsbury.",1341187200,,1564,4.794776119402985

649561,1,6303451144,"The REAL Lone Ranger, if you grew up in the 1950s-'60s, was played to the hilt by the immortal Clayton Moore. Moore's ""faithful Indian companion"", Tonto, was played by the equally immortal Jay Silverheels, an actual Indian. Both were great actors who made the roles their own.

NEITHER ACTOR APPEARS IN THIS BAD RE-MAKE MOVIE. DON'T BUY IT.

In 1978 Jack Wrather, who had been the producer of many Lone Ranger TV/movie projects with Clayton Moore in the title role, gained the legal rights to the Lone Ranger character and planned a feature film with a younger actor.

In 1979, Wrather obtained an injunction to stop Clayton Moore from appearing as the Lone Ranger in public, VERY much to fans' displeasure! Wrather anticipated making a new film version of the story, and did not want the value of ""his"" character being undercut by Moore's appearances. Also, Wrather did not want to encourage the belief that the 65-year-old Moore would be playing the role in the new picture. This move proved to be a public relations disaster. Moore responded by changing his costume slightly and replacing the mask with similar-looking wraparound sunglasses, and by counter-suing Wrather. He eventually won the suit some 18 months later, and was able to resume his appearances in costume, which he continued doing until his death in 1999.

Having grown up with Clayton Moore as *THE* Lone Ranger, I was there and can tell you myself how absolutely furious my fellow Americans were when Clayton Moore was prevented from making a living due to the injunction and this movie. It was the subject on every talk show for weeks! You see, Americans who'd met him understood that Clayton Moore the person was every bit as good as the Lone Ranger character he portrayed. Beyond that, he was a kindly old man then, just trying to make his living as he always had. The whole thing stunk of unfairness, and everyone could see it.

This movie absolutely bombed at the box office, losing 6 million silver bullets...er, dollars. Then, Clayton Moore won his counter-suit. Everybody cheered over that, especially when Jack Wrather apologized for the whole mess he'd created!",1324684800,3,2142,4.906077348066298

649656,5,6303451144,"Most people seem to think this is one of the poorer Westerns around, but as a long-time watcher of the Clayton Moore original, I think it more than does justice to its ""father.""  John Reid (Klinton Spilsbury), orphaned in an outlaw raid at the age of 10 and taken in by friendly Indians, returns to Texas in the fall of 1875 after having been raised by an aunt back East.  A lawyer determined to fight for justice--probably a natural outcome of his parents' murder and the fact that his older brother Dan (John Bennett Perry) is a captain in the Rangers--he is chiefly moved by one thing: that he knows the West is ""where he belongs.""  When the local newspaper editor (John Hart, who intriguingly, played the Ranger himself in his younger days) is murdered by the gray-hooded outlaws led by Butch Cavendish (Christopher Lloyd), John joins his brother's posse of Rangers to track down the killers and is caught in a vicious ambush at Bryant's Gap.  Afterward, barely alive, he's found by his boyhood friend Tonto (Michael Horse), who helps him to heal, and at last reinvents himself as the ""Masked Man"" who rides for law and order.  When he learns that Cavendish has designs on the person of President Grant (Jason Robards), who's coming to Texas on a hunting trip, the new-minted Lone Ranger has to move fast.

Baby-boomers who grew up on the TV version of this story will be intrigued by the way it has been matured for a new era, while still keeping itself from the kind of gratuitious sex and violence so prevalent in post-Production-Code movies.  It's a harder-edged film, with more shooting (and killing) and a ""blow-to-hell-and-gone"" sequence that rivals that of Rico Fardan and his friends attacking Raza's hideout in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Professionals-Special-Edition/dp/B0007MAO0C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Professionals (Special Edition)</a>, and it has something of the real hot-and-dusty feel of the Old West.  Lloyd--surprisingly young-looking and coolly rather than crazily maniacal--plays Cassidy as a thinking man's outlaw, clearly educated, appreciative of the finer things, insane (of course) yet aware of the need for stability and order in the new lands, intelligent, cold-blooded, ruling by sheer force of personality (he doesn't carry a sidegun and is only once seen with a rifle, yet he strikes fear into hardened desperados); his organization reminds you of some of those in the classic series&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Wild-Wild-West-The-Complete-Series/dp/B001CQONOA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Wild Wild West: The Complete Series</a>--it includes a sheriff (Matt Clark) and a Ranger (David Hayward), and as John Reid gets closer to the truth it discovers his progress and has a key witness shot down by a never-seen ambusher.  Spilsbury's Ranger is a complex man with hints of moral ambiguity; asked if he's ""here to save the President, or to get Cavendish,"" he can't answer; with Butch in his power he comes perilously close to cold-blooded murder.  Even Tonto has little reason to love the whites--at the time he discovers the Gap ambush, a recent raid on his village has cost him his wife and child.  Robards does a nice turn as Grant, showing both the side of him that drank a bit too much and the cool-under-fire veteran soldier.  The movie even dares to suggest a romantic attraction--naturally doomed--between John and Amy Striker (Juanin Clay).  And there's a great climactic scene in which Grant's guests--among them Buffalo Bill (Ted Flicker), Wild Bill Hickok (Richard Farnsworth), and the soon-to-be-martyred General Custer (Lincoln Tate)--come charging into the Cassidy stronghold (*after* the Ranger and Tonto have softened it up for them!) with plenty of whooping and shooting and flags flying.

The studio enforced an extraordinarily stupid PR move forcing Clayton Moore - an elderly actor in 1980 making a small living with public appearances as the Lone Ranger, the role he made famous - to ""ceast and desist"" from wearing the trademark mask. The legal snafu made headlines and hotshot filmmakers became international villains. Did it not occur to them Moore's appearances served as free publicity for the upcoming movie? Anyway, the film was a major bomb at the box office.

The casting of unknown Klinton Spillsbury in the lead, a man without a smidgen of acting experience and possessing the stoic presence of a Macy's mannequin, didn't help. Spillsbury has never worked again, so it's probably cruel to rub his face in the dust. But after watching the film (and he appears in just about every scene), it must be said his stiff portrayal sucks the film dry. Producers later dubbed his dialog with the voice of actor James Keach. Didn't casting directors listen to his voice before signing him to what was, at that time, a major role? The peculiar dubbing further contributes to an unusually lifeless performance.

""The Legend of the Lone Ranger"" is a movie update to a popular 1950's TV series, a formula that struck gold in 1978 with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Superman-The-Movie/dp/B000059Z8J/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Superman - The Movie</a>. That film also cast an unknown in the lead role, in this case Christopher Reeve, but at least he had prior acting experience. In fact, Spillsbury bears a slight resemblance to Reeve, but just lacks charisma, presence and ability.

The film was directed by William A. Fraker, the talented cinematographer of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bullitt-Two-Disc-Special-Edition/dp/B0008ENHTE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bullitt (Two-Disc Special Edition)</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Looking-for-Mr-Goodbar-VHS/dp/6300216853/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Looking for Mr. Goodbar [VHS</a>] and more recently&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tombstone/dp/6304711905/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tombstone</a>. Joining forces with Laszlo Kovacs, an equally gifted cinematographer, they created what is surprisingly one of the most beautiful Westerns ever made. Multiple shots show the Lone Ranger and Tonto as silhouettes on the horizon framed by the setting sun. A stagecoach robbery is filmed amidst the extraordinary vistas of Monument Valley. An ambush in a canyon where black-clad villains line the rocks firing rifles, is breath-taking in quality. Even the concluding dramatics where everything but the outhouse is dynamited, possesses great visual flair.

I like the pulp story they've written, where villain Bartholomew Cavendish, a sort of fiendish combination of John Chivington and Sam Houston, plans to kidnap President Ulysses S. Grant and force him to sign over Texas as an independent nation. But the casting of Christopher Lloyd is ill-advised. Largely a comedic actor with buggy eyes and cartoonish scowl, he lacks the necessary intimidation for such a role. Jason Robards has an extended cameo as Grant and is terrific, as usual, breathing life into a film desperately in need of acting chops.

""The Legend of the Lone Ranger"" explores the origins of the masked crusader, known as John Reid during his formative years. Before the credits have barely rolled, young Reid's family is murdered and he spends the following decade living with Tonto and the Indians. Since this film takes place in Texas, one is to assume Tonto is Comanche or Apache. Dedicated childhood chums, Reid and Tonto sit next to campfires while listening to tribal elders discuss the importance of dignity and justice in the English tongue. Reid's uncle, a Texas Ranger, arrives to take him home, eventually sending him to college to become a lawyer. When Reid returns, Bartholomew is a mighty powerful presence, lynching the local newspaper editor and massacring Reid and the Rangers in a canyon before leaving them for dead. Naturally, Tonto (well played by unknown actor Michael Horse, but with little to do) appears out of nowhere and returns Reid to the Indian village to heal and learn the way of the gun.

Reid, burning with vengeance, decides he must wear the storied mask so he cannot be recognized by Bartholomew, which seems odd considering the caped villain was standing on a canyon edge hundreds of yards away without a clear look at our hero. Eventually the Lone Ranger and Tonto are riding very quickly across the plains to the chords of William Tell Overture (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/25-Thunderous-Classics/dp/B00004Y6SQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">25 Thunderous Classics</a>), shooting guns out of people's hands and spurring their storied horses with forced dramatic flair (""Go Silver!"" ""Go Scout!"").

The beauty of ""Superman"" was that while it retained nostalgic touches of its origins, writers cleverly reworked the more dated aspects to give it a modern aura. ""The Legend of the Lone Ranger,"" if anything, embraces the corny origins of its material, stubbornly refusing to acknowledge modern audiences. The film stumbles between cartoon fantasy and dusty grit, unable to decide whether its for kids or adults, with several scenes coming off as laughably dated even for 1981.

Matters are not helped by the apparently post-production idea to have Merle Haggard (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/40-1-Hits/dp/B0001I2BWG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">40 #1 Hits</a>) sing a theme song, a terribly clunky tune having zero appeal. The mistake is compounded by having Merle narrate the film with endless passages of unnecessary description. Who comes up with these ideas? The heavy use of William Tell Overture further contributes to the film's overall cornball infusion. Perhaps a touch early on, providing a link to the Lone Ranger tradition, but then filmmakers should have distanced themselves from that archaic touch. For multiple reasons, ""The Legend of the Lone Ranger"" never clicks, unable to overcome disastrous miscalculations, barely rising above the level of a made-for-TV film, albeit a pretty one.",1260662400,,6643,5.992623814541623

649662,2,6303451144,"The early Eighties saw a slew of Westerns greenlit by studios, many hoping to ride on the coat-tails of the anticipated success of Heaven's Gate (who knew it would become a by-word for box-office disaster?) - The Long Riders, Cattle Annie and Little Britches, Barbarosa and this attempt by Lew Grade's ITC to start a new screen franchise. On paper it wasn't without promise. Legendary cinematographer William A. Fraker had directed the excellent Lee Marvin-Jack Palance Western Monte Walsh, while co-writers Ivan Goff and Ben Roberts had written a number of James Cagney films (including the classic White Heat) and William Roberts had written the wonderful comic Western The Sheepman as well as contributing to The Magnificent Seven. It even boasted a John Barry score.

The result was a massive and critically reviled box-office disaster in its day - it ran a single week in a handful of UK cinemas - not least because of one of the greatest PR fiascos in film history when the producers outraged America by taking out a court order to stop original Lone Ranger star Clayton Moore from wearing his mask at charity events. The stink was so great that even the same producers' Raise the Titanic grossed more. So, a quarter century on, is this little-seen, never revived Western really that bad?

Not exactly: it's just not very good, slow and pedestrian for much of its running time. It takes nearly an hour of drawn-out backstory for John Reid to don his mask and become the Lone Ranger, and once he does, he doesn't exactly do much. Indeed, there's little action in the film - a stagecoach robbery at the beginning, a good canyon shootout in the middle and a lot of explosions at the end. Unfortunately, it doesn't find that much interesting to fill in the gaps with.

Part of this is down to the leads. Klinton Spilsbury is inoffensive but defiantly unmemorable as The Lone Ranger - I've got furniture with more personality - while Michael Horse's Tonto fares little better. Jason Robards phones in his performance as Ulysses S. Grant, the great Richard Farnsworth has nothing to do as Wild Bill Hickok and Juanin Clay's romantic interest is dropped no sooner than she is established. Only a restrained Christopher Lloyd makes an impression as the evil Butch Cavendish.

Today the film is more interesting for its very obvious influence on the plot of the so very much better The Mask of Zorro - as in Martin Campbell's film, the hero adopts a mask and a disguise to avenge the death of his brother at the hands of a disgraced officer who plans to turn his province into a small country. There's even a scene between the Lone Ranger, disguised as a priest, and his romantic interest in a church confessional, a la Zorro. But what's missing here is the panache: everything is workmanlike and uninvolving. Even John Barry's score, hampered by Merle Haggard's unfortunate title song and some persistent rhyming narration, seems to be just going through the motions.

It's watchable and it's certainly not the war crime contemporary critics made it out to be, but it's still a missed opportunity.

To me, there's something fascinating about the concept of an actor making his film debut as the leading man in a major film, winning a Razzie award for the lousy performance, then never starring in a movie again.  To this day, no one really knows where Spilsbury is, what he's doing, or if he's even alive.  Rumor has it he was difficult to work with, and Wikipedia states that there is a rumor he was working at Subway for awhile!
Well, he had his 15 minutes(actually more like 98) as the iconic Lone Ranger in the 1981 bomb, The Legend Of The Lone Ranger-a movie considered so bad that it was swept under the rug and pretty much forgotten about.  Even people I know who are into westerns are surprised to learn that a Lone Ranger film was made.  Is it really as bad as it's reputation?  No, of course not.  It's got it's moments, but I thought it was more boring than anything.  The film shows how John Reid becomes the Lone Ranger, following him from his childhood where he meets his lifelong friend, Tonto, up to the moments he slips on the black mask(which is almost an hour into the film).  Reid comes back to his hometown, now as a lawyer, and finds himself tagging along with some Texas rangers as they go out after the evil Butch Cavendish and his gang.  Reid is the sole survivor of the massacre of the rangers by the Cavendish gang.  The gang manage to kidnap President Grant(Jason Robards), giving Reid the opportunity to kill two birds with one stone by saving the president and getting his own revenge.  So now, teamed up with his buddy Tonto and his newly acquired horse, Silver, Reid dons the mask and outfit and becomes The Lone Ranger.
Like I said, the movie is a bit on the boring side.  It's not nearly as epic as it would like to be, and the friendship between Reid and Tonto isn't fleshed out enough(though they try).  Tonto is played by Michael Horse, who folks may remember as Deputy Hawk in Twin Peaks.  He's easily one of the best parts of the film.  In fact, his character is played out as equal, if not superior to Reid.  Christopher Lloyd is great as the cold Butch Cavendish.  Is Spilsbury as bad as they say?  Nah.  He's wooden, but I've definitely seen worse.  He looks quite a bit like an American Fabio Testi.  The movie also has a musical type narration by Merle Haggard, which is unintentionally humorous, but amusing nonetheless.
All in all, this film isn't as bad as they say, but I doubt it'll make your top ten westerns list.  Now if we could only track down Klinton Spilsbury!",1236988800,30,2699,4.448065173116089

Let's look at some of the good things it has.  1) John Reid is made out to be a lawyer starting his practice rather than just a Texas Ranger along side his brother.  2) Jason Robards gives a performance of Grant that is believable.  3) Christopher Lloyd's Cavendish is not just an outlaw.  Here he is an ex Union Army officer and he runs his band like a western day Godfather.  Moreover Butch is only a nickname, his given name is ""Bartholemew"". 4) Collins, the double agent is more convincing, on radio I hear he was a half indian scout, here he is more the line of Benedict Arnold. 5) Michael Horse's Tonto speaks normal English even among his tribe while those who came before him did ""injun talk"" (even if they could speak normally when not acting like Silverheels or Todd). 6) For a time, John Reid has a love interest which makes you think that you may see more of Amy at a later time.  It doesn't happen, but the idea is what counts here.  Alright I agree, Merle Haggard's poor rhymes in his narration could have been improved, but they did help tell the story.  As for John Barry's music, it's not Dances With Wolves, but still lively to keep you awake for the whole 1 hour and 40 minutes of the movie (the recording of William Tell however aka the main theme during the fight scene at the end is first rate).  Finally you do see, the human side of Reid at the end.  The radio show and tv show made him out to be someone who would just fight for justice and would NEVER take a life, but you see here in the end that he was ready to take Cavendish out as revenge for his brother's death.  It shows that for a minute, his old self was still there.  It's when he realizes that he would be no better than Butch himself that he spares him, and thus now the code we all know the masked man lives by is established.  So look at this way, is the movie a turkey, YES.  Is it a movie to be ignored, NO. There are many people were around from 1980 to the present who never knew ""the legend"" and this does tell a reasonably accurate version of it.  It's taken nearly 30 years for hit to hit DVD, my advice, buy it and keep it with your rare treasures that come and go on DVD.  The chances on us seeing its like again are rare.",1229299200,9,2821,4.154411764705882

I thought the movie was a good retelling of the origion story and that it gave John Reid/Lone Ranger more of a human feel and that I could relate with him. I know that others didn't like the film, but I can still watch the film and feel like a kid again with it.

Also, they did absolutely NO remastering of this at all. I could have done just as good of a job recording my VHS copy to DVD.

649772,2,6303451144,"When I saw this movie as a kid (it hit movie theaters in 1981), I loved it. Saw it a few times. Wanted to be the Lone Ranger for awhile afterward, and bought all the accessories: Book, twin cap pistol set w/ hat and mask, action figures of our hero, Tonto, even Butch Cavendish (the movie's villain). So the movie was great for me back then. Still an enjoyable trip down memory lane for me having just seen it a few hours ago, but pretty laughable from the adult standpoint of looking for quality and high production value in a western. That's the first caveat.

The second caveat is that the DVD quality itself is barely decent--looks as if it was copied from a used VHS recording. I was actually shocked that Lionsgate agreed to put out such an inferior product on DVD. As it is, it's overpriced.

Beyond that, this movie is a mixed bag from the standpoint of filmmaking. Overall, it reminds me of one of those 'Saturday Afternoon Western' things you might have caught on TV in the late '70s. Seeing it again 27 years later, I'm surprised it even made it to the big screen (but you could say that about alot of films). Directing is okay, dialogue is bad, casting is decent: Christopher Lloyd is good, if underutilized, as the villain Cavendish, while Jason Robards (in what amounts to a cameo for him) plays an almost tongue-in-cheek President Ulysses S. Grant. (My favorite line of his, when he's talking to General Armstrong Custer: ""Give up your seat [for some dignitary] or I'll send you to Montana."" Priceless!) Our hero himself is played by some no-name, Spilbury, who offers a ruggedly handsome version of The Lone Ranger, and whose voice apparently was dubbed over by Stacy Keach, though that is not really in issue in the movie. Tonto is stoically well played by Michael Horse. The film score is by none other than John Barry (of 'Dances With Wolves' fame, among many others)--and of course, the famous William Tell Overture by Rossini, that people have come to recognize as The Lone Ranger theme.

PLOT SYNOPSIS:

In the beginning, we see the origin of The Lone Ranger (aka John Reed), including his boyhood in which he saves Tonto's life, sees his family killed by outlaws, and spends some time with Tonto's people before being taken custody of by his older brother, Dan, who is a Texas Ranger. Here also, we see Reed and Tonto become literal blood brothers, with Tonto calling him 'Kimo Sabe.' Then fastforward twenty years or so to when Reed is now an attorney and has returned to the Texas town of Del Rio to practice law--and where his brother is now Captain of the Rangers.

Following the murder of the town's crusading newspaper man (whose daughter, Amy Striker, is Reed's love interest), Reed accompanies his brother and other Rangers in a pursuit of the outlaws who did it--from the infamous 'Cavendish Gang.' Losing the trail in a canyon and betrayed by one of their own who is now working for Cavendish, all the Rangers are ambushed and killed, with the exception of Reed (thus, the Lone Ranger) who is found by Tonto and taken back to his native people for care.

After a full recovery, during which Tonto introduces him to silver bullets and the famous white horse Silver, Reed becomes The Lone Ranger and sets out to avenge his brother's death, accompanied by Tonto. From there, the main adventure element involves our hero and his trusty sidekick setting out to bring Butch Cavendish to justice. Along the way we see a train hijacking, explosions, shootouts, and of course the famous line, ""Who is that masked man?"" at the end. In short, all the legendary elements of this story are present in this film, which makes it a faithful--if rather pedestrian--rendering. It does take itself seriously, however, which allows the audience to do the same.
********************************
I think this is a movie that young kids would enjoy even today. And adult fans of The Lone Ranger looking for an updated (as compared to the old-time TV show), full-length origin-story, will find this fairly entertaining.

For those other adults looking for a quality western they can sink their more discriminating teeth into, and who aren't necessarily fans of The Lone Ranger story, better look elsewhere. Peckinpah's 'The Wild Bunch' and 'Ride the High Country,' Eastwood's 'Unforgiven,' Costner's 'Dances With Wolves,' and Kasdan's 'Silverado' are all great.",1220659200,4,4370,4.803191489361702

To clarify this is NOT widescreen; this film has been modified to fit the screen.  Had Amazon listed this properly, I probably would not have purchased it as I'm much of a cinema purist and would have preferred a full widescreen theatrical presentation (black bars and all) ... there are sections of the DVD transfer that are extraordinarily grainy, which is also a disappointment as I'm sure it couldn't have cost the studio that much to clean this up a bit.  Still, having been one of the few folks who comfortably admit to seeing this in its original theatrical run (I saw it several times), I'm glad some version of this is finally available on DVD.",1220313600,3,827,4.612244897959184
649837,4,6303451144,"I really enjoyed seeing this movie again, but was terribly disappointed in the quality of the DVD. Apparently the DVD is only available in full screen format, instead of widescreen. As a result the movie appears bleary, grainy, and poorly cropped. No wonder people have a tough time enjoying this show. I can only hope that someone, someday will be able to release this movie on DVD in widescreen.
As for the movie itself, I think it does an excellent job in the retelling of the Lone Ranger Legend. Of the many movie remakes based upon old TV series that I have seen over the years, I certainly rank this movie as being above average. Growing up as a kid in the 1950's, I had the pleasure of first listening to the Lone Ranger on radio, then watching the TV series, and finally seeing him in a full-length color feature at a local theater. Actor John Hart, who has a minor role as newspaper editor, Lucas Striker in the 1981 movie, originally played the Lone Ranger in the TV series, before Clayton Moore took over and became so widely identified with the role.
In 1981, the movie remake of The Legend OF The Lone Ranger got a bad and I felt an unfair rap even before it was released. The trouble stemmed from a dispute between Moore and the studio when Moore insisted that despite being 70, he should still have the lead role in the movie rather than being replaced by a younger actor. Moore made matters worse by insisting on wearing the legendary Lone Ranger mask at all his public appearances without authorization from the studio, which legally owned the trademark to the mask. After the studio took Moore to court and won, Moore further played on public sympathy by wearing dark wrap around sunglasses, since there was a court injunction forbidding him from further wearing the mask. As a consequence, overly zealous Moore fans went out of their way to boycott and bad-mouth the movie. I think there are still some fans today, especially Moore fans, who are still unwilling to give the 1981 movie a fair viewing as the result of this controversy that happened so many years ago.
By the way, since the TV series made a point of always keeping Moore's appearance disguised, or hidden behind the mask, fans can see what the man actually looked liked as an undisguised villain in the serial, Radar Men From The Moon, or it's remake, Zombies of the Stratosphere.
Finally, I like the soundtrack from the 1981 movie scored by John Barry. It was originally released as a LP. I really wish someone would re-release it as a CD.",1220313600,3,2524,4.586283185840708

I loved the Lone Ranger as a kid but the biggest problem with this movie (among many) is that actors/characters just take themselves WAY too seriously. When you read that all of Klinton Spilsbury's lines were dubbed (by the actor James Keach)and he never did another film after this you can see why. The Tonto character isn't bad but they had to throw in some 80's 'politically correct' dialogue into this film which kind of spoils the whole thing. To be fair how can you make an intersting hero out of the Lone Ranger in modern times, when he only wounds bad guys when he uses his gun? Watching this film you realize the reason a lot of movies take a long time to be released on DVD is they're lousey movies to begin with.",1219968000,7,778,4.372413793103449
649839,1,6303451144,"First of all, indeed -- amazon.com has the reviews section wrong.  Most of the other reviews are referring to the old television show, NOT the 1981 movie starring Klinton Spilsbury.

Now that we have that out of the way, there's little else to defend about this movie.  Klinton Spilsbury (who looks like a more chiseled version of Rick Springfield), just isn't very good in the part.  Admittedly, his voice was dubbed by actor James Keach, and I think this makes his performance even more wooden.  It's way too monotone.  I would love to hear Klinton's real voice some day.

The movie does have some saving graces.  John Barry's score is absolutely terrific (the Waylon Jennings ""songs"" are quite the opposite though -- any time his one man ""Greek chorus"" comes from the speakers, it's flat out embarrassing).  Jason Robards is quite good (although with limited screen time) as Ulysses S. Grant).  Christopher Lloyd is actually pretty good as the bad guy (although I don't know how people SO familiar with his ""Taxi"" character could not laugh when they saw him in this.

What makes this a one-star review is the HORRIBLE DVD transfer of this film.  It literally looks like they took a VHS copy and made the DVD out of it.  It's 2 channel Dolby Digital (and sounds as flat as could be) and the picture is 4 x 3 and not formatted for 16 x 9 screens.  It's embarrassing.

This movie gives all of the credit of creating the Lone Ranger to Tonto, even to the point of using a silver bullet, as the Lone Ranger could not shoot straight without silver in the bullets.  In the end, even Christopher Lloyd as the bad guy couldn't save this movie.

649910,4,6303451144,"So many BAD reviews.
I was surprised.

This movie ""bombed"" because it made people angry, and the film was subsequently boycotted on principle, but NOT BECAUSE IT WAS A BAD FILM.

As some reviewers suggest the main actors performance was so bad he never worked again! Wow. That's an uneducated and lame remark. The main actor probably never worked again partly because of the films lack of success. Which I've already noted had nothing to do with the actually quality of the film from a technical standpoint. The film industry is harsh. That's life. There are many actors who have only done one film, good or bad, for reasons aside from talent.

Okay so ... the way the film producers treated the original Lone Ranger, Clayton Moore, was disgusting. Yes. Google it, I'm sure you'll find the whole story.  I'm sure people who want to stay faithful to the original ACTOR, not necessarily the original character of the Lone Ranger, may choose to give this film a bad review thinking somehow that vindicates the situation.

Whatever.

You know, I don't know what to say about that. I saw this as a kid, long after the Lone Ranger Radio show, long after the TV series. Perhaps the original TV series was not available on VHS at the time I saw this? Or maybe my family couldn't find or couldn't afford VHS tapes of the original at the time they came out. All I know is my Dad and my Aunt grew up with and loved the original, but THIS is what we had access too in the 80's.

I saw this as a little kid & barley remembered it. I just found the VHS tape the other day and sat and watched it with my Aunt. It was a fun flick. Good action. Good acting. Hey...Christopher Lloyd is in it. He plays a very convincing bad guy.

Is it as bad as the Clayton Moore fans would have you believe?
NO :::::::Absolutely not:::::::

In fact I don't know what Moore fans think they have to gain from giving the film such poor reviews. Clayton Moore died in 1999. Do you give all of John Hart's movies a bad review too, just because he replaced Moore for a year when the TV show entered into a salary dispute!?

Bottom Line-------> This was a pretty good movie and if it will explain the legend of the Lone Ranger to another generation, a generation perhaps not interested in a 1930's radio show, or a 1950's Tv series ... and that gets another generation hooked ... don't you think that's was Mr. Moore would want? For other generations to know and love a character he spent his whole life portraying?

I do.

I'm pretty sure that Clayton Moore would be quite happy that someone my age is a Lone Ranger fan. That my sister who is almost 20 years younger than me is a Lone Ranger fan. Even if the producers of this particular film treated him like dirt. I'm sorry of the 'die hard' fans of baby boomer generation find the films ::mere existence:: to be an abomination.

649916,2,6303451144,"The early Eighties saw a slew of Westerns greenlit by studios, many hoping to ride on the coat-tails of the anticipated success of Heaven's Gate (who knew it would become a by-word for box-office disaster?) - The Long Riders, Cattle Annie and Little Britches, Barbarosa and this attempt by Lew Grade's ITC to start a new screen franchise. On paper it wasn't without promise. Legendary cinematographer William A. Fraker had directed the excellent Lee Marvin-Jack Palance Western Monte Walsh, while co-writers Ivan Goff and Ben Roberts had written a number of James Cagney films (including the classic White Heat) and William Roberts had written the wonderful comic Western The Sheepman as well as contributing to The Magnificent Seven. It even boasted a John Barry score.

The result was a massive and critically reviled box-office disaster in its day, not least because of one of the greatest PR fiascos in film history when the producers outraged America by taking out a court order to stop original Lone Ranger star Clayton Moore from wearing his mask at charity events. The stink was so great that even the same producers' Raise the Titanic grossed more. So, a quarter century on, is this little-seen, never revived Western really that bad?

Not exactly: it's just not very good, slow and pedestrian for much of its running time. It takes nearly an hour of drawn-out backstory for John Reid to don his mask and become the Lone Ranger, and once he does, he doesn't exactly do much. Indeed, there's little action in the film - a stagecoach robbery at the beginning, a good canyon shootout in the middle and a lot of explosions at the end. Unfortunately, it doesn't find that much interesting to fill in the gaps with.

Part of this is down to the leads. Klinton Spilsbury is inoffensive but defiantly unmemorable as The Lone Ranger - I've got furniture with more personality - while Michael Horse's Tonto fares little better. Jason Robards phones in his performance as Ulysses S. Grant, the great Richard Farnsworth has nothing to do as Wild Bill Hickok and Juanin Clay's romantic interest is dropped no sooner than she is established. Only a restrained Christopher Lloyd makes an impression as the evil Butch Cavendish.

Today the film is more interesting for its very obvious influence on the plot of the so very much better The Mask of Zorro - as in Martin Campbell's film, the hero adopts a mask and a disguise to avenge the death of his brother at the hands of a disgraced officer who plans to turn his province into a small country. There's even a scene between the Lone Ranger, disguised as a priest, and his romantic interest in a church confessional, a la Zorro. But what's missing here is the panache: everything is workmanlike and uninvolving. Even John Barry's score, hampered by Merle Haggard's unfortunate title song and some persistent rhyming narration, seems to be just going through the motions.

It's watchable and it's certainly not the war crime contemporary critics made it out to be, but it's still a missed opportunity.

On the plus side, though listed as 4:3 fullscreen, the UK DVD is actually letterboxed in the full original 2.35:1 widescreen ratio. No extras, but the reasonable price and the decent widescreen transfer helps compensate.",1163203200,5,3266,4.8969258589511755

For this reason I've never seen it and never will. The producers will not get a dime from me ... EVER.",1158451200,6,417,4.5

650011,3,6303451144,"Granted, this film could have received better treatment if Clayton Moore had been treated a little better. Now that he has passed, let's look at it from another perspective. It actually was a better than average flick. Spilsbury's acting was a little amateurish. Over-dubbing his voice really showed a lack of confidence in his abilities. It's time to release it on DVD so a new generation can express their opinions.",1130716800,11,417,4.9714285714285715
650012,1,6303451144,"I remember this bomb coming out in the early 80's. At first it sounded like a great idea. A retelling of an American classic with the help of modern movie techniques of the day.
There was a bit a of a back lash over the treatment of the original ""Lone ranger"", Clayton Moore. The movie studio had threatened legal action if Moore continued portraying him self as the real lone ranger. (Moore was performing at children's hospitals as the Lone ranger for sick kids.) To many Americans Clayton Moore was just that; the one and only lone ranger. I had always felt that the studio could have done justice to both the fans and legacy of the lone ranger if Moore had been treated better. Maybe even a cameo in the new movie. How ever this was not the case, and many of the viewing public stayed away in droves. Also the story and acting were weak. There is a very good reason why the lead actor playing the lone ranger only made one, and only one movie in his life. All this added up to a big box office bomb, and rightly so. I personally I'm glad the studio lost big money after the way the real Lone ranger was treated. You don't treat an American icon that way.",1129939200,5,1158,4.2681818181818185

I saw this movie several times when on first run, back when the nearst 1st run house was 45 miles away. People cheered when he first wore the mask and ""that"" song came through the speakers, laughed at President Grant's threat to Col Custer to send him to Montana, marveled at Christopher Lloyd's villain Cavindish and Michael Horse's dignified Tonto.

After seeing the movie I saw the televised review by two ""Windy City"" reviewers and was amazed at the inaccuracy of their description of several scenes. It made me wonder if they'd bothered to watch the film.

 Some have even described it as ""Hoaky"", if dignity, devotion, and duty are hoaky we need more hoaky. This film is one you can enjoy with your parents or your grandchildren and it's time for it to be available on DVD inn the USA.",1121385600,30,888,4.566037735849057
650014,5,6303451144,"I've heard highly negative comments about this movie for years, but I saw it recently and adored it! It's 'corny', but that's the beauty of it. I just had to own this. I just wish it were on DVD instead of only on tape. I'm a true Lone Ranger, Western, and Superhero fan. I have no qualms about putting this movie next to my other Ranger videos starring Clayton Moore, Bob Livingston, and John Hart. The Legend of the Lone Ranger isn't perfect, but none of my favorite films or heroes are. There are moments in this movie that really thrilled the kid in me and I found them very touching. That may sound 'corny', but it's true. I'd love to own this on DVD. Anchor Bay would be the perfect company to put out a special edition of this film on DVD.",1113177600,11,746,4.223776223776224
650015,1,6303451144,"When hapless young man's family is brutally murdered by the notorious villain Butch Cavendish (Christopher Lloyd), an Indian named Tonto (Michael Horse) takes the child under his wing. As the boy regains his health and his wits, he assumes the new identity of The Lone Ranger (Klinton Spilsbury) and vows for justice and revenge. However, his words are not his own: James Keach's voice was dubbed over Spilsbury's. Even Silver's whinnies were supplied by the Foley crew - the shame! An inauthentic treatment, all 'round.

650016,5,6303451144,"Just as the other reviewers have said, I watched this movie first when I was 12. And I was so moved and touched by the beautiful scenery, romantic and heart-thrilling music, and especially the image of Tonto (Michael Horse), through which I know there is a nation called Indian and immediately I have develped a respect for such a noble race. From then on I began to search what is the name of the theme music and then I know it was Rossini's William Tell Overture, and thus I developed a passion for classic music. Inspired by Tonto, I began to bury myself into books at libraries to find information about Native Americans, till this day when I am 29. I careflly kept the movie introduction cut from newspapers, the cinema tickets and posters collected from my classmates and everything related with this movie. Also inspired by Tonto, I choose English as my major at University and my graduation thesis in about the Native American image in westerns. I am never, never tired of watching this movie which I have watched again and again and again, and each time I was deeply touched again and again. I fill so lucky that after so many years I find somebody speaking the same language with me here (for so many years I have not found a person with the same feeling about this movie with me arround), and I do thank Michael Horse who have so successfully interpreted Tonto. From 12 years old till today, when I was lacking of confidence, when I felt upset, I am thinking of him, praying to get power and stability, and I do get them. I cannot imagine what my life would have be without knowing Tonto (Michael Horse). This experience changed my life so much.",998438400,14,1656,4.523333333333333
650017,5,6303451144,"The 1981 version of ""The Legend of the Lone Ranger"" is one of the best, and most beautiful, motion pictures ever made.  I first saw this movie when I was around 3 years old.  I loved it then, and I continue loving it to this day.  I don't even usually like westerns, but this one just happens to be on my top 10 list of favorite films for all time.
From young John Reed's witnessing of the tragic killing of his parents by outlaws, through his transformation into the Lone Ranger, and, finally, his rescuing of President Grant from the stronghold of the vile Butch Cavendish with the help of his faithful companion Tonto and trusty steed Silver, this cinematic masterpiece is completely successful in its attempt to relate the early adventures of the legendary Masked Man and his struggle to bring law and order to the Old West.
Along with an excellent storyline and a well above average cast, including Christopher Lloyd as outlaw Cavendish, ""The Legend of the Lone Ranger"" features an incredible musical score composed by maestro John Barry - a musical genius and ""legend"" in his own right.  Aside from the film's instrumental music, the film's theme song, ""Man in the Mask"", sung by Merle Haggard, is easily one of the best vocal performances ever from a feature film.  The bits and pieces of story narration heard throughout the film, also vocalized by Mr. Haggard, are also exciting and very well written.
Another one of the movie's many highlights are the locations chosen for the film's scenery, which really allow the viewer to feel as though they've actually been transported back in time to the Texas of the late 1800's.  Particularly exciting is the magnificent view of mountains and desert which accompanies the exciting chase and robbery of a stage coach toward the beginning of the film.
Don't listen to critics like Leonard Maltin, ""The Legend of the Lone Ranger"" is truly a wonderful & timeless piece of story telling that can be enjoyed by anyone, young and old alike.",989971200,10,1985,4.755813953488372
7847288,2,6303451144,"15 year old me thought this was a good movie when it was released, the 50+ year old me thinks it's pretty awful.

The voice dubbing is pretty obvious.  The story doesn't know if it wants to be a kid's movie or a ""serious"" action movie and falls flat because of it.  The video on the blu-ray looks like there's a piece of gauze over the camera lens; I don't remember if the original movie was like that or not.  If it was done on purpose, it's really annoying.

Save your money and pass on this one.",1524441600,,498,4.092783505154639

7847295,4,6303451144,"Haven't watched this movie since it was first in the theaters . Seeing it again,it was actually better than I remembered. Sadly,over the years,its been put down as being dreck .Mostly because of the limited acting range of its star, Klinton Spilsbury. ( Hey, its the only acting job he was ever hired for .)  He was supported however,by an excellent cast in Jason Robarts,Christopher Lloyd and Michael Horse. John Hart,who played the Lone Ranger for one of the 50s televsion series,has a role here as the publisher of the local newspaper. Excepting the scene where Tonto tells the Lone Ranger that silver bullets would make him shoot straight (better ), the script is actually pretty good. Much better that the Armie Hammer movie that came decades later. Yes, this Lone Ranger was worth the purchase price and was watchable.",1502323200,,824,4.885714285714286
