8267170,1,B0017T0Z12,"This (Michael Wolf Exposed) REEKS of the Disinformation that comes out after sighting or other reports by credible people (Airline/Military Pilots, Law Enforcement people and others who should be considered NOT NutCases).  Suddenly there are many reports  like ""I saw it too, then they beamed me up and we went to Saturn and everyone there is peaceful and Angels and Etc.  So much Disinformation that is patently false or insane that any CREDIBLE information gets mixed in and it all just becomes NOISE and is dismissed out of hand.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Michael-Wolf-exposed/dp/B0017T0Z12/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Michael Wolf exposed</a>",1380931200,,688,6.297872340425532
8267171,1,B0017T0Z12,"I can tell you right now,  if this book Dr. Wolf wrote is fake I will eat my hat !  I make a living out of pointing out liars  and this Man is who he says he is !  Don't listen to these people  if they are real  then they only got second hand information if that !

The books procedes went to a non profit org. set up in his Sons name that was killed .  This book is right on the money with the current ET assesment and this Man is in the know if ANY was ever .  This book was written before any of this information was main stream  he could not have known  especially if he was mentally chalanged

You can tell the Man is a Genius and is one of a kind and you can easily see why he is in the position of number two in charge of the ET cover up .

His facts match what I know from those  ""in the know ""  and they have certainly never read a copy of his book  this is an attack on Dr Wolf  take it from someone in the know,  and someone that knows a liar  and Dr Wolf is not a liar .

It's a fact that when you defect and  come out,  that ""they"" can reduce your past to nothing ,  and when you read this book you can easily see your looking at an edjucated Man  not some mental patient  as some will have you think,  they don't want this book to get any notoriety  ! save your self the 10 bucks and put it toward  The Catchers of Heaven  and see what the real story is .

Just look at his ""tags "" to sell this CD at a price everyone ""should own one "" at  those are your Penn and Teller  typical gov. disinformation specialist would add to get this seen !  Now after seeing this  I'm ever more convinced Dr Wolf is the real deal  (corso-junk science-gullible, roswell, bs )  why and who in the world would use those as tags to get their CD sold ?  wheew wee folks !  This is  scary  they are never going to disclose  anything !",1249257600,15,1825,3.76
8267172,1,B0017T0Z12,"I find it very interesting that folks always come out with a ""truth"" about a controversial figure, such as Michael Wolf and others AFTER their  demise. Where were your ""truths"" when he was alive? Why should anyone believe you now when you did not debunk him while he was among us? This is why it is so hard to put any credibility on your revelations. You remind me of the many folks who went on the ""Philip J Corso Debunking World Tour"" AFTER Mr. Corso passed away. That's like showing up for a New Years Eve party on New Years Day... too little and much too late. Get a real life guys, seriously.",1241136000,15,597,4.283185840707965
8267173,5,B0017T0Z12,"It is so good to see that someone with credibility has finally set the record straight. I tried to refute some of the proponents of the Michael ""Wolfe"" Kruvant mythology but was brushed off as being a government agent trying to hide the truth. The truth is that during the period from 1969-1976 I was Michael's friend and for some of the time his next door neighbor on Sumner Street in Hartford. At that time Michael was unemployed and was under treatment for psychiatric problems. While he was very intelligent and well read, he had no college degrees and certainly held none of the positions at universities or with the government that he  and his supporters later claimed. He was very imaginative and a creative guy. Despite his difficulties, he was a genial and charming man and I can see how he could pull the wool over the eyes of the lunatic fringe who wanted to believe that there is a massive government conspiracy to cover up UFO visits to this planet. He had never married or had children when I knew him and was not interested in women. I left Hartford in 1976 and had no further contact with him and was dumbstruck to learn a couple of years ago that he had written the book, Catchers of Heaven, and that people actually believed his claims and his phony biography.",1240272000,2,1278,4.532467532467533

Does this supposedly expose something re: Michael Wolf?  Why has it taken so long for this ""truth"" to come out?  Why should I spend the money?  Tell me.",1208304000,10,288,4.549019607843137
