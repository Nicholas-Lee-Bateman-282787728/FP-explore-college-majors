All of these CCC cartoons are well done, but this is one of their favorites, right along with Francis - Knight of Assisi, Francis Xavier and the Samurai's Lost Treasure, and Columbus - Adventures to the Edge of the World.  Each video takes about a half an hour.",1209513600,,354,4.348484848484849

7796849,5,156814010X,I bought this to teach my daughter about St. Patrick's Day.  She enjoyed learning the real the story.  We watch together often.,1398556800,,127,4.7272727272727275
7796850,5,156814010X,"I love this video.  I have taught 2nd grade catechism for many years, and I show this every year.  The kids love it, and I love it.  After I show it, I give them each a little guardian angel lapel pin to remind them that their guardian angel is always with them.

Today I showed it to my nieces who are 4 and 8, and they, of course, both loved it.  The older child asked me some very thoughtful questions throughout, opening the door to a provocative spiritual discussion.

I think the DVD is beautifully done.  The story itself is clearly inspired by angels and the songs are lovely.  It does a good job of explaining the nature of angels (which I also call spirit guides) and that they work in wondrous and sometimes mysterious ways.  It is a great opportunity to teach about St. Michael the archangel, the great protector.  I like the way they explain the voice of an angel as being in your ""heart,"" not a voice the way you hear it in this dimension.  I love how the hardened hearts of men who had been making bad choices are changed, as well.

I would advise anyone considering teaching their children about angels/spirit guides to watch this quality DVD with their children, and use it to open up discussion about God, angels, free will, etc.",1384646400,,1247,4.421052631578948
7796851,1,156814010X,"I was excited about this DVD because I want my children to learn about their guardian angel but as soon as I watched it I was very disappointed. Two children in the story start fighting. the boy is a bit rude and has nothing positive to say throughout the story. One of the thieves is calling the other one names....
A good Catholic story about a guardian angel should reflect love and peace...I don't recommend this movie.",1362182400,2,423,4.5064935064935066
7796852,4,156814010X,"These movies are not always quality productions, but my little boy (now 3) really likes this one. He loves the songs and is really attentive when watching it. What it has done is allowed a story for me to be able to talk to him about his guardian angel.",1323648000,5,253,4.183673469387755
7796853,2,156814010X,"I was very disappointed in this DVD, and I have the opinion of a 4 year old to back me up.  It was not at all what I expected for young children.  I watched this with my grandson, and I was very surprised to hear words like ""stupid"" and ""brat"" in this film.

The story tells of two thieves, who rob a jewelry store, and then lose the jewels.  One bracelet accidentally ends up in the hands of a little girl, who places it on her pet rabbit.  The thieves follow the family on vacation attempting to retrieve the bracelet.  In the end, the thieves do help save the little girl and her rabbit when they are in danger; but I think that in addition to words that should not have been included in a Christian children's animated film, it is also a little frightening for very small children.",1250121600,6,785,4.23489932885906
7796854,3,156814010X,"This is a fun, well-done story, but it's not one of my favorites among the wonderful inspirational cartoons published by CCC of America. It really doesn't show a guardian angel helping someone, as I thought it would; instead, it discusses guardian angels, and then shows a person helping a little girl who is in serious trouble.  We are left to presume that that person who helped had a change of heart and was inspired to help because of a guardian angel, but that's not at all obvious, especially for children.",1209513600,7,512,4.688888888888889
