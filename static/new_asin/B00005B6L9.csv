7936884,5,B00005B6L9,"My older sisters and I watched this movie as kids when our aunt brought it over and we thought it was hysterical! We mentioned it every now and again and I had been looking for it ever since. I found it on amazon and got it for my sister. I thought maybe it wouldn't have stood the test of time but it did. It's a very funny, sweet movie.",1418860800,,338,3.9130434782608696
7936885,5,B00005B6L9,"I first saw (and loved!) this movie as a high schooler and even now in my 20s it's still one of my favorites. It is lighthearted and fun - perfect for watching with a bowl of ice cream in your PJs, not with a date or film afficionados. As a few reviewers mentioned, this is basically the foil of an Olsen twin picture-perfect international adventure. The movie focuses on two normal-to-slightly-dorky best friends in a small town whose lives are turned upside down after they find a magic ring at the local antiques shop (run by a charmingly kooky Kathy Baker). My favorite aspect of the movie is that it is SO relateable, with the fantastical twist of the magic ring thrown in. The girls are NORMAL - their biggest woe at the moment is not having dates to the Spring Fling dance, they have to deal with orthodontists and strict parents, and they're just all-around nice girls. The movie is incredibly family-appropriate but still very fun and enjoyable for kids and adults. Watch it - you will love it!!",1297814400,3,1004,4.583333333333333

7936887,5,B00005B6L9,"This movie is very funny.  There IS a lot going on in the background (as the other person wrote) so watching it again is lots of fun.  I recommend this for teens and adults, too, who want to watch a clean movie about some hilarious situations these young girls get into.",1206144000,2,270,4.2745098039215685
7936888,5,B00005B6L9,"I mean it. I have now lived a complete, fulfilled life. I couldn't have lived a more fulfilled life if I worked in a fulfilling factory instead of a Nike shoe factory in Moscow, Russia. I haven't had this much fun since I got that girl at the fireworks stand in so much trouble.",1047254400,3,278,4.166666666666667
7936889,5,B00005B6L9,"The perfect antidote to Mary Kate and Ashley Olsen! This one of the sweetest, cutest, funniest movies I've ever seen for the 8-14-year-old set. The humor is sharp without ever being mean-spirited, and there's always something going on in the background, which makes repeated viewing rewarding. Even adults will find plenty to love about this one! No violence, a couple of extremely mild double-entendres (so mild that they went right past my 10-year-old daughter), wonderful performances by young and seasoned actors alike. The two girls are natural and just darling, and Kathy Baker and Ron Silver turn in marvelously nuanced performances as a pair of lonely, slightly flaky star-crossed lovers. Fun, fun, fun. Buy it for the preteen girl (or enlightened boy) in your life!",1029456000,6,774,5.2
