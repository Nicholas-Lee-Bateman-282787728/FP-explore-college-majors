157004,5,0792841840,"Ive never laughed out loud so hard and for so long as I did at the final bowling match up between McCracken and Munson. THE HAIR....THE HAIR, at the end of that scene, my face hurt, my stomach hurt, I was in tears.  Bill Murray is pure comedy genius.  The entire cast is great.  If you ever just want to forget about all your problems for a bit and laugh, I mean truly laugh out loud, please watch this film.  This is not just a dude film.  I also love The Big Lebowski.",1516838400,,470,4.010752688172043

157008,4,0792841840,"Woody Harrelson, Randy Quaid and Vanessa Angel team up for this comedy hit. ""Kingpin"" tells the story of Roy Munson, a professional bowler until one fateful night when he swindles the wrong people. As punishment they grind his hand up in the ball return, forcing him to use a prosthetic hand and a hook. Down on his luck and behind on his rent he notices a naive Amish man who has mean bowling skills. Through manipulation he persuades him to enter a tournament in Reno. Along the way they pick up Claudia (Angel) an attractive woman who knows more about hustling then they do. But, after they reach Reno pressure and tension build when they encounter Roy's nemesis Big Ern (Bill Murray)

Thankfully, Paramount has offered both cuts of this film. There is the original theatrical cut (not seen since its original VHS release) and there is also the extended edition MGM only offered on DVD. Paramount's release of the Rysher film is the best I have seen it look in HD, albeit grainy but mostly clear and a vast improvement over the 480i transfer from '99. The only con is no delete footage even though it can be seen in the theatrical trailer, so here is hoping that another release comes out with this deleted footage.",1511395200,,1218,4.612903225806452

157035,5,0792841840,Kingpin is one of the funniest films ever. I've seen it 3-5 times and it's still funny to me. The performances are fantastic and it feels like every scene is filled with jokes. It's movies like this that make me feel nostalgic for the good old comedy days of the 90s era. It's not often that a movie is consistently funny like this one is.,1500768000,2,339,4.230769230769231

157037,3,0792841840,I cant help but laugh every time I watch this.  Woody Harrelson stars a bowler who mostly goes around  hustling.  He finds an amish bowler who he trains.  Randy Quaid has one of his best roles playing  the naive amish  who Harrelson is is showing as much about the world as he is bowling.  Vanessa Angel whose name fits her in this. I don't think I knew who she was before this.  And I have never seen her in anything else where she looked like this.  Bull Murray shows up as a champion bowler whose hair ends up stealng the movie.  When I saw Zombieland.  I kept waiting for them to make a reference to this but they never did.,1499731200,,628,4.15
157038,4,0792841840,"This may be Bill Murray's last great performance. I dare you to try not laughing when he's on screen. And he's barely in the movie.

Kingpin is a great comedy about bowling that may have run into the bad fortune of being released shortly before The Big Lebowski, another bowling movie that's become a cult classic (the Coen Bros., who directed Lebowski, experienced a similar situation in 1990 when their excellent gangster film, Miller's Crossing, was upstaged by Goodfellas; both movies were brilliant, one just got a little more attention). Kingpin is also directed, interestingly enough, by a team of brothers, the same guys responsible for Dumb and Dumber and There's Something About Mary (Mary was the movie that brought these guys the respect they deserved for Kingpin). This is a good movie to own on DVD because a.) you can pop it into the DVD player every few years and the jokes will still work and b.) it's the kind of movie ruined by censorship when it's aired on commercial television.

This kind of comedy, a mixture of gross-out humor with melodrama, has become the standard in Hollywood. Nobody does it quite as well as the Farrelly brothers were doing it in the late 1990s.",1497225600,,1191,4.776699029126213

I wish I had let divine intervention be my guide, as there were obstacles in place (not Amazon's fault) that  prevented me from getting this.

I WISH I HAD TAKEN THIS AS A SIGN.

I give myself credit for my disdain for the lead actors not interfere in my buying it, but I tossed $10.00 out the window.  Lesson learned.

(Characters weren't believable, story was equally unbelievable and stupid.  The worse of it was, NO part of it did I find FUNNY.  Worse picture they have made....must have been conceived like one reviewed said when the writers were on drugs.)",1489881600,,709,4.653225806451613

157152,4,0792841840,"Kingpin. The ultimate movie about bowling. The ultimate movie about a bowling whiz who loses his hand in a bowling accident. Quite some time later, or many movie-time seconds later, the whiz finds himself challenged to an epic bowling tournament by the new champ of all bowling champs played by Bill Murray, a hoot to watch, a joy to witness and the perfect reason why this movie is neither forgettable or bland. So, to prepare and most certainly win against all odds, he gets help from the most unlikely sources, such as an Amish whiz-man, played by Woody Harrelson of ""The People Vs. Larry Flynt"" as well as Haymitch in ""The Hunger Games"" franchise and ""Zombieland"" and the girlfriend of a certain millionaire, who abuses our two intrepid heroes and a whole lot of others. Then, it's all smooth sailing for our gang of heroes. Or is it? After all, there's that pesky yet all too important bowling tournament coming right up. Directed by the Farrelly Brothers, who were coming from ""Dumb N' Dumber"" and shortly before they made ""There's Something About Mary"", it is quite delightful with the way the plot moves and diverse, with its inclusion of Amish people and the girlfriend of a millionaire who's fed up with his abusive behavior towards her and our heroes. Plus, it's smart for casting Bill Murray in a role that'll most certainly make you root for him and the Empire he represents. That alone makes this worth watching.",1425254400,,1426,4.754032258064516

157356,5,0792841840,Good comedy,1416355200,,11,5.0
157357,4,0792841840,"More than the Big Lebowski, Kingpin is an off-kilter, warped romp that is classic Farrelly Brothers' oddness across a rack of moral lessons buried to not seem preachy. When Woody Harrelson has his bowling ball-tossing hand fed to a ball-return after ""hustling"" some local hustlers -- and set up by a smarmy if pernicious fellow bowling champ played by Bill Murray -- his life of promise unravels.
Reduced to selling supplies to bowling allies, it is a chance meeting with Randy Quaid, playing an Amish bowling savant, that sets Harrelson back on the road to winning bowling championships again. A seamy underbelly, a hot girl, a double-cross that gets double-crossed and the emergence of Quaid's good-to-the-core Amish young man into the realm of temptation and sin provide ample room for high jinks, jokes and pratfalls. And in the end, the ending is anything but what you'd expect.
To laugh, to root, to think about what really matters, how bad guys some times finish first and the reasons to keep following your dream, ""Kingpin"" is an unlikely jewel. But it has the quirky performances, the excessive gags and the characters that are over-the-top that have give this unheralded comedy its luster.
The soundtrack, too, is a gem. Classics and '90s pop come together seamlessly in a collection of musical cues that reinforce so much of what's taking place on the screen, but would be just as satisfying without the film to bolster the songs.",1416268800,,1441,4.934156378600823

However, there is not very much bowling until the end of the movie, and the film gives bowling a poor image.  Most of the bowlers shown appear pretty dumb and unsophisticated.  A lot of the humor is pretty crude.  The acting is probably pretty good, in that we really disliked Bill Murray's character, and we supposed the character depictions of the other people in the film were pretty much what the author and director intended.  The story ending makes one feel a little better about the plot, but I think the same story could have been told without making bowlers and the industry look so bad and without some of the crude humor.",1398556800,,757,4.529411764705882

157448,5,0792841840,"I can't believe how many times I've heard people saying they've never seen it. Peter Farrelly has stated that the movie was under marketed and released the same time as the 1996 Atlanta Olympic Games.  But if you do watch it what you get is probably one of the best comedic sports films ever. It's brilliantly cast, Woody Harrelson is just a natural really.  Yeah he might always play a guy who's a little left of center, but in this he's just a man who's been pushed down over and over and he's given it up. Randy Quaid(who is insane) plays a down to Earth but misunderstood and sometimes to him not as respected Amish man. Roy Munson(Harrelson) notices his bowling talents and decides to get his life back through Ishmael's(Quaid) skill.  Along the way they meet up with Claudia(Vanessa Angel) who basically helps the boys because she's trying to scheme both. The entirely film is nutty, and what's most impressive is unike Dumb and Dumber, the jokes here are way more subtle.  The humor is truly earned and it never feels forced. Plus Bill Murray as Ernie McCracken steals every single scene and improvised just about every single line.

If you really like Dumb and Dumber, or Forgetting Sarah Marshall,  The Forty Year Old Virgin. Humor that doesn't have to have all it's guts and tricks given up just so you don't have to think then this is for you. Make it happen because this is truly a lost gem of a film.

Harrleson learns a hard lesson and becomes a bum. Randy Quaid enters as an Amish protege after years pass and hilarity ensues.

Woody Harrelson plays a young bowler who puts his trust in the wrong person and pays a huge price, as a result.

Bill Murray plays an aging veteran who sees in Woody a threat to his now dwindling career, and will stop at nothing to keep Woody from taking his spot as the country's most elite bowler.

Randy Quaid plays a nave, Amish bowler (yes, I said ""Amish"") who Woody thinks can be the next big thing. Woody tries to hitch his wagon to Randy's star and the comedy ensues.

When Kingpin (1996) came out, I saw it in the theater.  It created a lot of buzz in the bowling world.  There was even a PBA tournament named after it (the 1996 Kingpin Classic, won by Jess Stayrook).  This movie is funny.  It stars Bill Murray, Randy Quaid, Woody Harrelson, Vanessa Angel, and Chris Schenkel.  Cameos are made by some professional bowlers, such as Mark Roth and Randy Pedersen.  While the movie is funny, it also didn't do anything positive for bowling's overall image.  Many felt, as I did, that it was another setback for the sport of bowling image-wise.  But.......whatever.  Who cares.  It doesn't matter now.

McCracken tempts him into running a scam that gets poor Munson so roughly handled that his bowling hand is torn off (non-explicitly), replaced by a hook, which he covers with a grotesque rubber hand. More than a decade later Munson's name is synonymous with failure. While on a futile trip to sell bowling supplies, he encounters Ishmael (Randy Quaid), an Amish youth who secretly practices bowling. A million-dollar bowl-off in Reno against the hated McCracken makes Munson go to extremes (like trying to pass as Amish) to enter Ish in the tournament. But Ish isn't as good a bowler as first thought, and that's just the beginning of their travails. After an altercation at a mobster's private alley, they flee with the tough guy's sexy moll (Vanessa Angel), who competes with Munson to control guileless Ish's destiny",1343692800,,964,5.069182389937107

157520,5,0792841840,"I am writing this review because I am shocked. I am shocked because I see a caption from some moronic half-critic saying that this movie is bad. They also drew up a comparison with ""the Color of Money(hello: lame!)"" and the other 2 movies that Farrelly brothers made before and after this one and made it seem that this one is the lesser.

I am guessing that this person liked Top Gun and didn't like This is Spinal Tap.
This is another item I am willing to review because it never get's old. I can never watch it enough to get sick of it. Fine, maybe I don't require CGI, budgets, correagraphy, tears, or tears and brain-damage from watching Ashton Kutcher. Or some other half-actor that is supposed to be some kind of iconic entertainer. Sorry to Ashton Kutcher if I hurt his feelings but he does give people brain damage and make them want to cry for being in the same universe.

Ehem... Now that I am done rambling about absolutely nothing let's move on to reviewing this delicious DVD.

I liked the VHS version because they cut out some completely unneeded seens but those same seens are actually good and add to the humor and character development. They sometimes add to the vomit development as well.

This movie is probably in my top five favorite movies including Tom Jones which is also constantly extinct.

The more people try to mold everything in entertainment to what's real and mold themselves to unreallistic expectations in real life they become dumb and mean. In turn that makes more new things that suck come out and saturate our means of entertainment and attention spans. To put it more clearly TV and radio are filled with a lot of crap. Unvirtuous things like sex and money which I agree are great but mean absolutely nothing without some kind of plot. I admit there is still some good out there. I am rambling about nothing again. I apologize.

...catches you off guard with simple, yet clever humor with a great plot and cast that cannot be beat. It is also somewhat of a pioneer in sports comedies that came in the following years. I recommend this movie to all because it is fun, has a great soundtrack, and does mirror real-life situations with an imaginitive perspective and humor that leaves a feeling of serenity so you don't get whiny like me.

There's my review. Good, simple things always die and bad things always attract the simple-minded. Maybe I'm a jerk but so is everyone else and I hope you enjoy it. Oh, yeah and this movie is really entertaining as well.",1237507200,,2497,4.572706935123042

157522,2,0792841840,"I've never been a huge fan of the Ferrelly brothers (they surely aren't the Coen's) but this film starred Bill Murray (or so I thought) and I just love him so I had to watch it at least once.  Truth be told, Murray is hilarious here in every frame he's in, but sadly he's just not in enough.  Woody Harrelson, and to a lesser degree Randy Quaid, are funny in their own rights here, but neither of them can truly carry this film and it isn't really until Murray comes onto the screen that my attention was gotten and I found myself fully amused.

`Kingpin' tells the story of Roy Munson, a young guy who quickly rose to the top of the bowling world due to his dynamic skill and training.  When he makes enemies with the greedy Ernie McCracken he finds that all is not fair in love and bowling.  After an altercation that leaves Roy without his bowling hand he slips away into obscurity.  The love of the game has not left Roy though, and when he catches a glimpse of the Amish Ishmael Boorg and sees his raw potential for the game he offers to manage him.  Thankfully Ishmael's family is in dire need of some quick cash and so he agrees to allow Munson to train him for an upcoming tournament.  Along the way they face some difficulties, and when they finally make it to the tournament they have to face McCracken.

The truth of the matter is that `Kingpin' only works some of the time.  A lot of the gags fall short, especially after a repeat viewing.  Woody Harrelson had a good year in `96, but that was due to his Oscar nominated performance in `The People vs. Larry Flynt', not this underwhelming comedy.  His performance isn't bad, but I just feel that the overall material is too weak to really sustain the audience.  Murray is really the only standout, mostly because his delivery is so naturally funny (thanks to his adlibbing just about everything he does).  When McCracken is on the screen I am in stitches; but when he leaves I am bored.",1218153600,,1948,4.389972144846797

I have yet to meet someone who didn't think this movie was absoluteley hilarious, but according to Tom Keogh (who?), it ""doesn't work at all"" and ""isn't funny at all"". Who picked that guy? Do not listen to him.

This is one of the funniest movies that you'll ever see, full of laugh-out-loud slapstick as well as a myriad of more subtle, creative jokes that will just crack you up. Its so funny and so enjoyable its basically guaranteed to put you in a good mood, and I can't imagone anyone thinking it's not funny, unless their name is Tom Keogh. Its an excellent sophomore effort by the Farelly brothers, following the enormous success of the insanely funny Dumb and Dumber, and it has their trademark style imprinted all over it (downtrodden protagonist, stunning hottie, crude gags, cheerful rock soundtrack). But rather than relying almost entirely on the comic genius of Jim Carey, this movie spreads the funny almost equally amongst its stars. Woody Harrelson as the cynical, alcoholic bowling has-been Roy Munson, and Randy Quaid as his naive Amish prodigy, are a pure joy to watch, and Bill Murray gives one of the funniest performances of his career as Roy's perfectly evil worm of an arch-nemesis, Ernie McCracken (""Big Ern's got a heart of gold, Bob"").

This film kind of flew under the radar and didn't recieve as much attention as the Farrelly flicks that came immediately before and after it (Dumb and Dumber & Something about Mary), but its at least just as funny. In fact, in my opinion, the Farrelly brothers have not approached this level of funny since. Sure, Something About Mary was very funny, but it is much more dependent on the crudeness of its humor than on the funniness of its chracters and script. And each Farrelly movie that has come out since then is for the most part forgettable. There are way too many hilarious moments in Kingpin to list here, so many that there are a few you might not even notice (""What're you doin' there, Mr. Munson?"" ""Flossin'."" ""Flossin? Where'd I get Munson from?""). But trust me, if you watch this with your friends, you're stomach muscles will hurt from laughing and you'll be quoting its jokes amongst each other for years to come. I'll leave you with this:

  ""I took the liberty of milkin' your cow for ya. Took a while to get'er  warmed up, she sure is a stubborn one."" (sips from the pail of milk)

157532,4,0792841840,"Kingpin is a classic comedy about a washed-up bowler named Roy Munson (Woody Harrelson), and his young Amish apprentice, Ishmael (Randy Quaid).  It starts out with young Roy as a child, learning how to bowl.  Once he gets into his twenties, he becomes a professional bowler, and everybody loves him.  He begins to hustle people at bowling alleys, pretending he is a terrible bowler with his accomplice Ernie McCracken, (Bill Murray).  Though Bill Murray is not mentioned as a main character, he is simply hilarious and vital to this film.

 During a hustle gone badly, Roy finds himself in a bad situation.  The guys he was hustling at the bowling alley end up finding out about his scam.  In return, they put Roy's right hand in the ball return at the front of the lane.  His hand gets amputated, and his bowling career comes to abrupt halt.  It turns out that his so-called friend Ernie McCracken had him set up, in order to take his place in the bowling alley.

 Roy ends up an alcoholic salesman who sells bowling products to the local bowling alleys.  He is poor, and can barely afford rent, but then he meets Ishmael, an Amish bowler that he ends up coaching to stardom.  Everyone in the movie is great, but Bill Murray as Ernie McCracken is a comical genius and easily one of the funniest characters I have ever seen in a movie.

 Filled with classic scenes of comedy, all of the actors play their roles to a tee.  Woody Harrelson plays a great bald, burnt-out loser whose luck cannot possibly get any worse.  Just when you think his life is completely in shambles, he discovers Ishmael, and convinces him to go on a bowling tour.  Having an interesting tour of the country, the Amish farmer has quite an experience living a whole different lifestyle.

 Directed by the Farrelly brothers, who brought you Dumb and Dumber, you can expect a well-directed comedy with countless punch lines.  Being a very underrated comedy, I am surprised this film is not more popular.  Overall, Kingpin is a classic comedy with great actors and is well worth purchasing.",1144886400,,2059,4.674094707520891

Kingpin is the most hilarious and underrated Farrelly brothers comedy made! It's a story of a has-been bowler named Roy Munson, played by Harrelson, who had lost his hand after his so-called pal Eddie McCracken, played by Murray, runs off and leaves poor old Roy to the gang of bowlers who just got nailed by the duo. Years later, Roy has become a drunken, out of shape, bald headed loser who discovers an Amish farmer, played by Quiad, who can bowl like a pro, and takes him around the country in his car to hustle and win the bowling championship against his arch-enemy McCracken himself. The movie obviously lampoons such past films as The Color Of Money, with a funny spoof on Indecent Proposal, which starred Harrelson also, which features a cameo by Chris Elliot.

The movie is not to be taken seriously at all. It is, however, the funniest film made by the Farrellys, and that's just my opinion.

Then again, I've never seen a bowling-based movie I didn't like, so maybe I am biased.  I'd estimate that about half the people I've asked say they don't like this movie.  Most of them twist up their face as part of their reply, to emphasize perhaps the level of their distaste.  Reminding them of the classic Mrs. Robinson inspired scene that ends with Woody Harrelson puking over the toilet (very convincingly by the way) for what seems like several minutes, has never suceeded in changing a single mind.  The other half seem to love this movie as much as I do (I get similar polling results when I inquire about the 3 Stooges).  If you like good slapstick, you will love this movie and probably find yourself watching it again and again, chuckling at work over whatever bit is tickling you at the moment.

Seventeen years after the accident, Roy sees a possible way out of his problems, Ishmael, an Amish bowler.

Randy Quaid is equally funny as Amish bowling prodigy, Ishmael Boorg.  Bill Murray steals every scene he is in as Ernie ""Big Ern"" McCracken.

There are so many funny lines and so many memorable moments.  Vulgar, disgusting... and hilarious all the way through, ""Kingpin"" is a comedy treat that stands out from most of the comedies of today.
Roy Munson was a bowling legend until a hustling gig gone wrong ended up taking his right hand.  Now, Munson is an alcoholic mess who can't even afford his rent.  Everything seems to be a giant downward spiral for him until he sees somebody who has the potential of becoming the next great bowler that he could've been.  That person he sees is Ishmael; a person of Amish decent that secretly goes bowling without his family's knowledge.  Munson knows that with this Amish bowler under his watch that they can turn the bowling world upside down...or at least do their best not to ""Munson"" it all up!
I absolutely love this movie.  It is hilarious and clever at the same time.  There are sick and vulgar gags, to be sure, but I don't see them as overly gratuitous or annoying.  They work for what the film is trying to accomplish.  There are many, MANY moments were I am laughing out loud hysterically.  Woody Harrelson  is terrific as the alcoholic mess, ""Roy.""  Randy Quaid is also a joy to watch, as he always is.  Yet, I must admit that the man who simply steals the show without breaking a sweat is Bill Murray.  He is brilliantly funny and outrageous in the most subtle of ways.  He's always the showstopper without trying too hard.  I loved everybody in this movie, but I have to admit that Bill was the one who I was the most impressed with, and he makes the movie what it is.  The script is extremely funny and takes the comedy to a different level.
The DVD is poor when it comes to special features.  It'd be great if they would releases a special edition of this movie, as it is extremely popular.  The great thing about this movie is that it's not PG-13 anymore and now has an R-rating, which includes footage that was not included in the original theatrical version.  The picture and sound quality is more than satisfactory.  The DVD includes both widescreen and fullscreen versions.  Commentary from the Farrelly Brothers and the original theatrical trailer are included as well.  I wished more was included, but hopefully a fully-loaded special edition will come out sometime in the near future.
""Kingpin"" rolls strikes every single time when it comes to delivering laughs and a great script.  While the gags can be a bit disgusting and vulgar at times, they are not gratuitous and they end up working in the movie.  If you're looking for a comic gem that is unlike any other comedy that is out there, this may be the one for you.  A five-star movie all the way!",1070668800,28,2828,4.568588469184891

I may have been the only one laughing out loud when I saw this in the theater. I remember at least two people walking out sometime during the show. No matter because for me, this ranks as one of the the most brilliant and unique comedies in a long, long time.
The Farelly Brothers, who would return to us in such top form with ""There's Something About Mary"" give us an insane twist on the comeback-kid story.
Woody Harrelson is Munson, a washed-up former bowling protege who finds a way out in Ishmael, a simple Amish farmer with exceptional skill on the bowling lane. Munson sees the kid as a tool for revenge, for money, for fame -- all the things that were denied him (largely by the hand of his ruthless rival, deliciously played by Bill Murray in one of his funniest supporting roles).
What follows is a practically non-stop series of gags, satire and slapstick that are brilliant in their timing and effect. The Farrelly Brothers give us no mercy as we follow Munson and Ishmael on their journey. But the jokes, many of which border on the surreal, never seem gratuitous.

157550,4,0792841840,"In a rare instance of the UK getting a movie before the US, Kingpin was a surprisingly pleasant discovery on a Saturday afternoon back in the sunny July of 1996. It has since gone on to be one of my favorite comedies and showcases Bill Murray's evil, sarcastic humor at it's finest.

Woody Harrelson is Roy Munson a young, up-and-coming bowler who falls foul of 'Big' Ern McCracken (simply by beating him). Ern executes a cunning revenge on Roy which results in the loss of his precious bowling hand. Flash-forward 17 years and Roy is living a truly grotty life and is a complete and utter loser. His hustling attempts fall flat and it looks like he's destined for a future of failure until he meets naive Amish 'boy' Ishmael, who just so happens to be a bowling prodigy. Roy and Ishmael team-up and head to Reno, Nevada for a big bowling showdown with the diabolical 'Big' Ern.

Part road movie, part profound life journey, Kingpin is probably the most mature Farrelly Brothers movie and certainly their best effort so far. The script is just jam-packed with brilliant dialogue and gags, and Ishmael (or 'the kid' as they keep calling him despite the fact that Randy Quaid was 45 at the time of filming) may just be the sweetest character of all time and may even rival Cousin Eddie as Quaid's funniest role. But it is Bill Murray as 'Big' Ern who steals the movie and runs away with it. Apparently he just threw the script away and decided to ad-lib, and you can tell. He keeps the rest of the cast on their toes and enjoys himself way too much. His Unified Fund TV commercial is comedy gold.

It may well be one of the most underrated comedies of all time, but Kingpin is a far superior film to the likes of There's Something About Mary or Me, Myself & Irene. It's lack of success or popularity is not a reflection on its brilliance.

The DVD looks horrible in 2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen with Dolby 5.1 sound. Why is there not a Blu Ray yet. This DVD hit the shelves less than two years after the format hit the streets. Blu has been around for 5 years now and we're STILL waiting!",1038960000,5,2086,4.452879581151833
157551,4,0792841840,"Oh! This could have been a 5 star movie! If they had just kept the levels of humor above vulgar slapstick this could of been a real masterpiece. Well the offensive slapstick aside, this is a really good tape. Though I suggest parents screen it before they let their children watch it. Well, that said, this is a really good movie that does not rely on special effects. There is a really good story with characters that can speak to us. We may argue that what happens to Roy (losing his hand) is his own fault, but in a way he represents all of us by twisting the rules to get ahead. He is a great creation in that he is a faulted hero. We certainly won't see him as blameless, but we can understand his actions, and he goes through an interesting moral development. Ernie McCracken is very, very, bad. But he carries a charm that makes him likable despite his evil nature. Stanley is the same way. He is really fierce and brutal, but he also carries a charm that makes him more fascinating than repulsive. Ishmael is well handled (for the most part). In a world of under the table deals, and corruption, his untainted innocence is touching. (Especially if we consider the fact that most people who bowl, are doing it for money. While Ishmael wants to bowl to save his home and Ahmish family.) I know some Ahmish reviewers were somewhat offended by this movie, but in all honesty, this movie actually made me interested in learning more about the Ahmish and their culture.

157555,4,0792841840,"(Anyone with a low threshold for gross-out/toilet humor, STAY AWAY!)
""Kingpin"" is a highly underrated film that tragically remains unseen by many people. There are two reasons for this:
1) It's a film about bowling.
2) It's a gag-filled comedy starring Woody Harrelson, a good actor in his own right but one who just doesn't have the kind of audience-drawing power of, say, Jim Carrey.
But don't let these factors fool you. Woody and bowling are a odd coupling, but it does wonders up on screen.
The strength of ""Kingpin"" lies in its characters. All three of the main protagonists undergo individual arcs that are completely believable and relatable to the audience. Vanessa Angel's street-smart but wanton sex cat develops into a charming woman. Randy Quaid's Omish oaf matures into an adult and makes a name for himself. And Woody Harrelson's Roy Munson changes from a one-handed, past-prime, deadbeat, ex-bowling-champion to a decent human being.
Of course, great characters are nothing till great actors bring them to life. And what a cast! Woody Harrelson, a highly underrated actor, gives a stand-out performance. Bill Murray? Forget about it. This guy's the king of witty, understated, visual comedy. And geez, who would have ever thought Randy Quaid could be this funny? Displaying excellent comic timing and delivery, Quaid surprised me as much as Jeff Daniels did in ""Dumb and Dumber."" Unfortunately, ""Kingpin"" does have a weak spot: Vanessa Angel and her less-than-stellar acting voice. But this is only a small distraction. She manages well and has great chemistry with the other two leads.
I firmly believe this is the best film the Farrellys' have made so far. Sure, ""Dumb and Dumber"" is funnier but it's a film that has no impact (which is fine since it's a goofy comedy). Sure ""There's Something About Mary"" is more romantic (in a twisted sort of way) and made tons of money but it's a film that's too harsh and over-the-top. ""Kingpin,"" on the other hand, makes you laugh and causes you to care about its characters - about the hero of the story, in particular. Roy Munson starts off truly dispicable and pathetic, but ends up charming and appealing. He gains much empathy in his quest to become a ""winner."" And when he goes up against Murray's Ernie McCracken in a bowling showdown (which, by the way, is as tense as any other showdown in the world of sports), you are there with him, aching and hurting and hoping he'll win. And he does become a winner. Just not in the way you'd expect.
Truly, the ending of ""Kingpin"" is the Farrellys' finest hour of storytelling: they fall into a screenwriting pit (how will Munson be redeemed?), defy both cliche and expectation, and come out on top with a moving, poignant and highly satisfying ending. You will be hard pressed to find another comedy bearing so much heart while retaining its witty humor.
As for the DVD itself, it features a R-rated cut of the film that includes added scenes, which admittedly, do not really add or take away anything from the overall movie. Just some raunchier material. And there's the commentary from the Farrellys, which is amusing but random, spotty, and not very informative. Obviously, this disc is not brimming with extras but can't complain with the cheap price. You'll also notice the DVD has both widescreen and full-screen versions of the film. Normally, I only watch widescreen because there's no cropping. But take note, this film was shot in super35, which basically means it was shot in full screen and matted to cover the top and bottom (some directors, like Cameron and Verhoven, are known to shoot in this format). Widescreen crops the top and bottom. Full-screen shave a little off the sides. So take your pick.",1018310400,2,3722,4.87223974763407

157566,4,0792841840,"The primary purpose of this movie is to garner laughs, even at the expense of believability and reality.  Nevertheless, ""Kingpin"" holds a certain visceral appeal that is not necessarily related to humor and that ""Dumb and Dumber"" and ""There's Something About Mary,"" two other Farrelly Brothers movies, while also funny, do not have.  Maybe ""Kingpin"" has - dare I say it? - heart.
First, the laughs, of which there are plenty.  In the tradition of ""Airplane!"" this movie is spilling over with gags and also in the tradition of that seminal movie, some of the gags are funnier than others.  A couple of the weak ones: the urinal scene, the s**t storm.  The wince inducing one: poor Buttercup (what is it with the Farrelly Brothers and animals?).  The funny ones however more than compensate.  My personal favorite is the depiction of the drunken, down on his luck Munsen done to ""It's a Beautiful Morning."" by the Rascals.  I can never hear that song in the same way again!  The jokes are audacious but not mean spirited, suprisingly enough.
Then there are the characters!  Bill Murray as Big Ern McCracken is a comedic classic, a character of unprecedented arrogance and unctiousness.  The directors were wise to let him ad lib.  The landlady is wonderfully grotesque.  Stan, the psycho boyfriend, deserves kudos just for the way he pulls money out of his pocket.  Those shady characters in the bowling alley the night Munsen loses his hand.
Second, the heart, or the je ne sais quois, or whatever. I guess it has to do with the main characters, Roy and Claudia for being downtrodden but still kicking, Ishmael for his naivite.  Even though the movie never passes up a chance to exploit Roy's prosthetic hand for a laugh, I felt sympathy for him. He actually is a three dimensional, evolving character. You want him to succeed even as you laugh at his expense or at Ishmael's expense when Roy corrupts him with non-Amish ways.
The movie is shot in a lovely way what with the rolling bucolic farmlands as Roy, Claudia, and Ishmael wend their way to Reno.  The generous use of rock and pop tunes interspersed with the original music paces the movie nicely.
It is these ingredients - characters, scenery, music, not to mention a strong plot - that bolster the movie several notches above 90 or so minutes of mere laughs.
[A few words about the DVD itself: I bought it because it contains footage not previously shown but I wonder about the wisdom of including it in the movie itself. Some of the extra gags did not seem to fit. They struck me as jarring.  Perhaps if I had seen it in this way first. My major complaint is that the footage I really wanted to see, that which is shown in the trailors, was NOT included.  Ah well.  It's still worth owning.  One nice little feature enables one to watch the movie while listening to the directors' commentary throughout.]",993168000,5,2863,4.676646706586826

157569,5,0792841840,"By far the best and funniest of the Farelly Brothers films, the overlooked Kingpin features a lot of laughs and a truly excellent soundtrack. Woody Harrelson plays Roy Munson, a once promising bowler whose career is cut short along with his right arm. Randy Quaid plays Ishmael, an unworldly Amish man whose one vice is bowling. After being down and out for several years Munson convinces Ishmael to enter a $1 million winner take all bowling tournament in Reno. Roy and Ishmael hustle their way across the country from Pennsylvania. Along the way they hook up with the beautiful Claudia played by Vanessa Angel. Bill Murray plays top professional bowler Ernie McCracken. McCracken is a total scumbag who is largely responsible for Munson's misery.  This movie is loaded with laughs with most gags hitting the mark.  By the end of the movie, if you have any heart at all, you will find yourself rooting for Roy and Ishmael.  My only complaint is that the home version contains added scenes that were best left edited out of the movie.",983404800,7,1034,4.797752808988764
157570,4,0792841840,"Peter and Bobby Farrelly set ""Kingpin"" in Scranton, Pennsylvania, where a washed up bowler with one hand(Woody) who hasn't found major success in 15 years finds a promising Amish striker(Randy Quaid). Woody does whatever he can to get Ishmael to bowl with him, including disguising himself as an Amish. Ishmael leaves home for the money that is promised with a victory of a bowling tournament, which will give him the money needed to prevent foreclosure of his Amish ranch. The cast is very well attached together, with Bill Murray as the rival between Woody and him, and Chris Elliot as a gambler. It is classic Farrelly Brothers' with a lot of raunchy, but hilarious quips. It isn't as funny as ""There's Something About Mary"" or ""Me, Myself and Irene"" partially because the leading females in ""Mary"" and ""Irene"" are more likeable, whereas Vanessa Angel was the biggest mistake for this movie, with her annoyingly arrogant and unfunny presence.

157573,3,0792841840,"I'm an ardent fan of the Farrelly brothers; they make FUN films.  However,  this sophomore entry is easily their weakest.  This could be attributed to  the lack of Farrelly involvement in Kingpin's screenplay, and the entire  film would generally be a waste if not for Bill Murray.  This man, given  the proper role, is the funniest supporting actor I have ever seen  (Caddyshack, Rushmore, etc.), and is responsible for this film's truly  funny moments.  The rest of the film consists of weak gags combined with  half-hearted attempts to make you care about the characters they abuse with  the aforementioned gags.  This combination was successful in Dumb and  Dumber (because it was actually funny), but not in Kingpin.
Definitely  watch Kingpin (if only for the Bill Murray segments), but don't purchase it  without viewing first...",968457600,,835,5.119402985074627
157574,4,0792841840,"The Farrelly Bros. have proven themselves to be inspired comic directors  that have enormous talent even if their idea of humor is crude and raunchy.  Their short career has been filled with ups and downs starring with `Dumb  and Dumber' which is so-so, then `Kingpin', which is probably their best,  followed by `There's Something About Mary' which has a softer side and a  larger audience and then the Jim Carrey misfire `Me, Myself & Irene'.  While `Mary' is often thought of as their best, `Kingpin' is in a lot of  ways better and has a higher LPM (laughs per minute) average. Quite  possibly the funniest movie of the 90's, I'm not saying it's the best  comedy, just that it's the most constantly funny. Woody Harrelson is  hilarious and so is Randy Quaid as bowling Amish (?) Ishmael. Bill Murray  is hilarious and steals almost all his scenes. Vanessa Angel is the  super-sexy Claudia, she is the typical sexy female presence that the  Farrelly Bros. seem to need to round up the cast, in order they are; Lauren  Holly, Vanessa Angel, Cameron Diaz and Renee Zellweger. As for the typical  `hair gel' joke we've come to expect from the Farrelly's, this time it  deals with Roy `milking a bull' and drinking the `milk'. The film is filled  with these jokes that are still hilarious even after repeated viewings. It  also features a great soundtrack with songs from Goldfinger and other  modern bands. The `bowling sequences' are well made, nicely edited with a  great soundtrack, with a heavy dash of humor and exciting as well. Roy  loosing the tournament and avoiding the typical ending was a great move and  heightens the originality level, which is very high. Peter and Bobby  Farrelly are very talented comedy filmmakers and some of their films (at  least 2) have become instant comedy classics. If they're lucky they might  be considered the `Mel Brooks' of their generation, not because their humor  is the same (it isn't, Brooks is better), but because they are fearless and  original filmmakers that revive the comedy genre every decade or so.

It's 1979 and Ocelet Iowa is Roy Munson (Woody  Harrelson) territory. When it comes to knocking down the pins, Roy-boy  moves like a leisure-suited Fred Astaire and throws the strikes when they  count. He bowls the pro circuit until Ernie ""Big Ern"" McCracken  (Bill Murray)--the skunk of the tournies, the guy with the worst hair since  Shatner--leaves Roy to get his hand lopped off by a bunch of  pinheads.
Downtrodden, drunk, and sinking low (and I mean it literally)  to pay the rent, Roy discovers a naive forty-year old Amish farmer named  Ishmael (Randy Quaid) and figures he can make him into a bowling  thoroughbred. On the road to Reno and a million dollar payday, the odd  couple picks up well-proportioned Claudia (Vanessa Angel) and proceeds to  pack their trip with enough gross-out humor to keep you gassed-up for  life.
Made by the Farrelly Brothers, Kingpin hits a few of its marks on  the bull's eye. Roy's time among the simple people provides some of the  nastiest/goofiest moments. But then, too much crude and rude and not enough  fun and ny wreck the gross-out get-down.

The Farrellys are easily the most talented comedic  directors in film today.
Onto the DVD itself.
The deleted scenes in  the DVD aren't that great and in some scenes are no more than the addition  of one or two lines of dialogue.  I really didn't laugh much at all while  watching them.  They also seemed to change it from 12 minutes to 4, but  after seeing the 4 minutes, I can see why.  However, the widescreen format  is great and the commentary is also pretty good.

I feel the casting was done just right and I think Woody Harrelson and Randy Quaid fit the roles just right, possibly even better than Jim Carrey and Chris Farley who were rumored to be potential choices for the roles. The film is a ""dumb"" comedy in the vein of ""Dumb and Dumber"" and relies on gross gag humor but I don't feel as if it's overdone in this film as in others in this genre, possibly to keep the PG-13 rating. Adding Bill Murray as the antagonist was great casting and helps spark the film. I gave this movie three stars for the genre it's in. No, it's not a brilliant comedy or anything close to groundbreaking humor but it gets the job done for the crowd and fan base it is intended for.  Instead of most comedies where jokes are thrown in here and there or worked up, Farrelly bros. movies treat each scene as a skit. Overall, good comedy for it's time. Although I personally like the casting choices I wonder if the film would've done much better in the box office if they would've  chosen Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels (still hot off of Dumb and Dumber).",1525737600,,1152,4.378504672897196
