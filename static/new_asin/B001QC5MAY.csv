8335340,1,B001QC5MAY,"Series One was worth five starts easily.  It was one of the funniest, most biting satires I have ever seen.  However, never in the history of television has a program jumped the shark so quickly.  By Series Two, the edge has gone and so have the laughs.  The brilliantly demented Mr. Gormsby has been reduced to a loveable eccentric who spreads good in the world.  The acting is still top notch, but the show relied on Gomsby's madness and with that softened away, there is not much left.  By the time we see the right-on leftist teacher Steve fall down a cesspit due to student hi-jinks and climb out covered in feces, we could be watching any witless movie made for teenagers.",1251590400,3,678,4.516393442622951
