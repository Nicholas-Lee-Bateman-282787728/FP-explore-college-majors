8642366,4,B00IINRB58,"Very funny British stand up comedy here as Russell Howard takes his one man show to Bristol and packs in pretty much everything inside a 90 minute set. Russell is obviously at home on the stage and controls the room very well. He is able to go the extra mile partially because you the audience are already big fans so he can take some chances. The audience interaction is excellent and the show is obviously very rehearsed but also very much bristling with energy.

There is very little topical humour here which helps it travel well and also prevents it from going out of date. The bonus features on the disc are basically just some skits that weren't in the main show and so don't really add any insight - there is no 'big reveal' style of behind the scenes stuff here.

To be fair it should be mentioned that there is a slew of bad language here and a goodly chunk of it is based on sexual comments and commentary. Just in case that's an issue for any prospective buyer. But outside of that this is very funny stuff where we get discussion on a whole range of social topics and self-deprecating 'Englishness'.",1514246400,,1112,4.446078431372549
8642367,5,B00IINRB58,You can never go wrong with Russell Howard. If you like Russell Howard's Good News you will definitively like his stand-up shows. And he always have a lot of heart in his shows too.,1450569600,2,181,4.352941176470588
