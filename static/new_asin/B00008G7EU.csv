I admit normally this would be frustrating and a problem, however when you start to get it it is so rewarding. This show is so good it creates a desire to have a deeper understanding of the world and does not feel like a chore at all. And trust me, I hate learning new things.
When you can explain the difference between Keiki and Renrin, and why they are named what they are, you are winning!",1357862400,,541,4.161904761904762
7982977,5,B00008G7EU,"This series was an awsome anime. It will be a great injustice if this series does not continue from Chapter 10. The story was Eloquently told and has alot more to be said before

 it is finished.",1125792000,2,195,4.243243243243243
7982978,5,B00008G7EU,This is the best anime ever.  But there have been no new releases since volume 10 for a long time now.  I HOPE THIS IS NOT THE LAST VOLUME!!!  DOES ANYONE KNOW IF THERE ARE ANY NEW RELEASES PLANNED?,1125792000,,198,4.0256410256410255
7982979,4,B00008G7EU,"When Youko comes to visit the King of En along with Rakushen, they are told that the King is not in. They find him by the graveside of someone named Atsuyu, a person En refers to as ""his other self"". What follows is the backstory behind this cryptic reference. Twenty years after En was enthroned, a frustrated provincial lord named Atsuyu believes, along with most of the Royal Court, that their relatively new king is useless. They think the king is more interested in visiting brothels and gambling than ruling the kingdom. Even his Taiho, Enki, doesn't have confidence in him. When Enki is deceived by an old acquaintance and taken hostage by Atsuyu, King En might just show his true mettle.

These last episodes run parallel to the tests that Youko has just overcome in the previous episodes. A new ruler having to prove themselves and assert their authority over a doubtful court. Every character in this anime has complex motives and sometimes commit evils in order to do good. Or people with the best of intentions end up condoning horrible crimes. They are full of love, envy, jealousy, mercy, kindness, etc. All earmarks of true human beings. I have never seen anything like this anime, except in great works of literature. It was a long journey through 10 dvds but it was a unique and rewarding experience.",1120521600,4,1317,4.751091703056769
7982980,5,B00008G7EU,"Sigh... the end has finally come for an excellent and beautiful tale.  After many haroing adventures, Youko's quest has ended with one last lesson to learn. The story's plot ended as well as any can with so many questions and yet many others answered.  However, it still ended with a quiet dignity and finality that is hard to find.  There was no climactic battle, no triumphite music; just a shot of Youko (with Rakushun by her side), smiling her soft smile, reasuring us that everything will be OK.

I, like another reviewer, would like to thank Anime Works for bringing this beautiful tale to America and doing such a great job with the English dubbing. Its so sad that the series was ended with 20 episodes left, however I am grateful that I found such a wonderfully thoughtful tale.  I recommend this DVD and the entire series to everybody.",1112832000,5,845,4.644295302013423
7982981,5,B00008G7EU,"It's been a long road, both for Youko (the lead character) and the fans. We've waited patiently for these volumes to be released and here they are. An end to a glorious series that any anime fan should consider as essential. Complex characters that drive a story that has almost as many layers as Dune. An onion like plot that has yet to be fully peeled yet satisfies those with a desire for great story telling. Don't let this jewel pass you by. Special thanks to Anime Works for bringing this beautiful series to these shores.",1111449600,7,528,4.510416666666667
7982982,5,B00008G7EU,"Finally America has released the last volume of The Twelve Kingdoms. Its been a fun ride but unfortunetley it ends now folks. They don't really leave you on a cliff hanger... the 5 episodes that compose this story come full circle with everything... its just that you can tell more was supposed to come after this. The project got abandoned for reasons i don't know and has the possibilty of picking back up one day, but i doubt it would be a TV series again. Maybe a OVA or movie if anything.

bottom line, get this if your a fan, but if you can't deal with lack of closure... this one is gonna be a tuffy for you!",1110758400,6,615,4.211864406779661
