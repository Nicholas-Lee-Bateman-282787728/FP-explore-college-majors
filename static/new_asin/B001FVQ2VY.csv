8392766,1,B001FVQ2VY,My son and I tried to use the cogmed program and the practitioner we used was no help at all. This is just a scheme to take high fees from people seeking assistance. We used local neurofeedback training and it was much better. Tell me how many people with attention have the self discipline to keep up unsupervised training that shows no immediate value. DOnt waste your money.,1397260800,16,377,4.5588235294117645
8392767,1,B001FVQ2VY,"At a particularly low point in the school year and desperately seeking help for our son in managing his ADHD, we shelled out $1500 to a psychologist who prescribed Cogmed Working Memory Training, a web-based training system.  We were skeptical but vulnerable enough to give it a try, the theory being that improving working memory will transfer to improvement in focus, ignoring distractions, planning, and completing tasks. It turns my stomach that I didn't do research or request a trial period.  I admit I was totally suckered. By Training Day 2 (of 25) our son informed us he hated the program, and he continued throughout the entire training period pleading with us to stop Cogmed.

As we found after purchasing the program, searching online for verified efficacy data on ""Cogmed"" routes you to websites for psychologists who market Cogmed but it is difficult to find any scientific information on it.  On top of feeling cheated about the entire concept, we also experienced technology issues with the web server, with the DVD, with the limited Cogmed/Pearson tech support.  In the end, the last sessions were freezing so much I don't even know if the final data was complete.  By that time my husband & I felt so scammed and Cogmed was such a dirty word in our household, we didn't even care what the psychologist claimed the training data were revealing.

After the training period, the psychologist asked us to complete a Cogmed rating sheet, which is so general that it implies behavior improvement must be attributed to Cogmed. (No free text option to mention that our son switched medications and we made dietary changes, as well, during the same period he did Cogmed.)

Save your money.  Save your household from increased stress. Save yourself from false hope.  I don't see anything harmful about working memory exercises, but you could probably find some free brain games that would be more engaging and just as useful.",1339718400,35,1933,4.938271604938271
