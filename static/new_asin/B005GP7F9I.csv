4693042,4,B005GP7F9I,"""The Topp Twins: Untouchable Girls"" is a biographical documentary crossed with a concert film about Jools and Lynda Topp, identical twins who are, apparently, the biggest thing in New Zealand comedy. The twins are in their 50s now, but they have been activist performers since their late teens. Jools plays the guitar. They both sing, usually folk or country-western. They do characters and stand-up. Their performances are tinged with political activism, combining music, comedy, and politics in their own idiosyncratic blend. Comedy writer Paul Horan points out that ""yodeling lesbian twins"" should not work ""on paper"", but they do. Their candid, down-to-earth, fun demeanor endears them to people who might normally be turned off by their message.

A recent concert by the twins runs through Leanne Pooley's film. I'm not sure why, but Jools and Lynda related their lives and careers in this concert, asking people who had made a big impression on them to join them on stage. Their parents, brother, and friends were in the audience. So this is a good launching point for a documentary about their lives, as we can observe their style and hear their story in their own words. There are also interviews with the twins, with colleagues, interviews with the twins in character, and archival footage of their personal and professional lives. Not surprisingly, the Topps are a major force in gay rights in New Zealand. This is a conventional documentary, but perhaps that is the best way to introduce the world to the unconventional Topp twins.

The DVD (Kinosmith 2011): Bonus features are a theatrical trailer (2 min), 9 deleted interviews and deleted scenes, and a featurette entitled ""Beginnings"" (24 min). This offers additional information about the twins' childhood, including more interviews with their admirably sensible parents, their brother, fond memories and several funny stories recounted by the twins. No subtitles.",1323734400,,1929,5.239482200647249
4693043,3,B005GP7F9I,Charming (though a bit reverential) look at these groundbreaking and door opening twins. The filmmaker wisely cuts away from the subdued and ordinary framing concert at every opportunity using the music as a backdrop for the sister's fascinating history. I would love to see the Topp Twins tour with a reunited Romanovsky and Phillips.,1323302400,,335,5.222222222222222
4693044,5,B005GP7F9I,I love the Topps Twins.  However it is often hard to get stuff in the US by them since they are out of New Zealand.,1321228800,,115,3.6
4693045,5,B005GP7F9I,"Leanne Pooley's 2009 award-winning documentary about New Zealand's Jools and Lynda Topp, billed as the world's only yodeling, country-singing, twin lesbian comediennes (though they prefer to be known as singers who are funny), has just been released on DVD.

The documentary profiles the Taurean twin sisters (born May 14, 1958 in Huntly, located in the Waikato region of the North Island of New Zealand); real cowgirls, who grew up singing to the cows on the family's dairy farm near Huntly.

Patriots with particular political passion for social justice and nuclear disarmament, Lynda and Jools left home at 17 to join New Zealand's rough equivalent of the United States' erstwhile Women's Army Corp.  Reflecting on their New Zealand military service ""before it was integrated,"" Lynda describes the three-month training experience as ""sort of like a pajama party with guns.""

Natural-born entertainers, the twins' harmony singing and comedic bent resulted in their developing a cast of characters including Camp Mother & Camp Leader, Raylene & Brenda, and the cross-dressing Ken and Ken.  But the sisters don't flaunt their sexuality so much as embrace it and, as a result, they have a worldwide, mainstream appeal.

As Comedy Writer Paul Horan says of the Topp Twins, ""On paper they should not work.  On paper they should be commercial death.  But they totally deliver to the audience time and time again.""

In their native country, the Topps have used humor to both make a point and defuse controversy when they assert their penchant for activism.  Such was the case when the twins dealt with their government's position on gay rights: ""The law had said it was illegal for consenting adult males to engage in sex.  But it was an injustice.  We felt like it was an injustice.  We said one day they'll make a law that includes the lesbians.  We need to step up to the plate and we need to make sure we're part of this homosexual law reform bill.""

Needless to say, they were.  As New Zealand Prime Minister Helen Clark recalls, debate on the bill ""polarized the Parliament... I think the Topps being so proudly who they were helped make the issue seem a more mainstream one...  It had real people associated with it.  Good people- like the Topps.  And that helped carry the day.""

When cameras are not capturing the Topp Twins singing, as they are positioned on the front lines of numerous political demonstrations for their favorite causes,  Joolie and Lynda are seen clowning around, most famously during their Great New Zealand Gypsy Caravan Tour.

But life is not all joy, even for the joy-filled Topp Twins (who, for instance, demonstrably inform audiences that ""Yodeling is all about hip movement."")  Should there be any doubt about that, or the fact that the camera never blinks, ""thanks"" to archival film Pooley took full advantage of access to footage of Jools going through chemotherapy for breast cancer.

Untouchable Girls, titled after the Topp Twins' song of the same name, has won more than 20 Best Documentary awards.  Non-rated and running 84 minutes, the film has been screened at over 80 international film festivals, winning the Cadillac People's Choice for Best Documentary at its North American premiere during the Toronto International Film Festival.

4693046,5,B005GP7F9I,"There is something about Topp Twins: Untouchable Girls that is bigger than you think. Maybe even bigger that it ought to be... but bigger nonetheless. There is something grand about this film, and there is something magical about Jools and Lynda Topp and the lifelong career they assembled.

From a comedy perspective, there are scenes in the film that will leave you laughing on the floor...(sheep coloring? doggie doos?)... and that's great! But Jools and Lynda Topp are undeniable characters that rival anything you might have seen in vaudeville, anything you may have experienced in political activism, anything you might have seen at the local music house and then some. Jools and Lynda Topp are country...Jools and Lynda Topp are rock & roll. Jools and Lynda Topp are comics and characters. Jools and Lynda Topp are open lesbians and Jools and Lynda Topp marched to a drumbeat they developed... and the fans followed from down under to the U.K to the U.S.A. ""Untouchable Girls"" captures all of their multiple layers, and their layers were not simple personas that they put on like masks for the sake of the show, but layers that these sisters lived by and allowed their audiences to see vividly.

If the Topp Twins were American, Untouchable Girls would be an American story of living your dream and finding success. Oddly, despite the accents, and despite the New Zealand locale, when you watch Untouchable Girls you feel America all over it even though it's not there but for a glimpse. The film tells a world-wide wonderful story of inspiration, of music, of laughter, of activism, of politic and of course... of incredible yodeling.

Jools and Lynda Topp had natural guts, and this film does, too. I loved it!",1316995200,8,1719,4.900343642611684

 We had first seen this film in NZ several years ago, and were captivated.  We were happy to be able to buy it with a format that works for our US DVD player!  We look forward to watching it many more times, and introducing our US friends to the Topp Twins!",1498003200,,432,4.3375

These two zany women are once in a lifetime delights! I'd love to see them live but I guess I'd have to get on a plane. I can see why New Zealand calls them a National Treasure! I need to find more footage of them.",1470441600,,344,3.7916666666666665

8472032,5,B005GP7F9I,"What a delightful show. I had never heard of the Topp Twins, but now that I've seen them, I want everyone to know about them. These farm raised lesbian twins, born in 1958, have made a grand life out of having fun. They are unabashedly silly, unexpectedly talented free spirits, who's voices blend ""like one voice in stereo"". One wouldn't think that 2 lesbian twin political goofy gals would win over a country, but they are clearly as beloved to New Zealand as Elton John is to England. I just ordered their TV series and can't wait to see more of them!",1375488000,,554,4.4411764705882355
8472033,5,B005GP7F9I,"I enjoyed learning about these two women very much.  They are extremely funny and in touch with their audience.  What they champion happen to be similar beliefs as mine so that makes them all the more likeable.  Their actions reflect their commitments and they don't participate in movements because they think it is good for their career but because they truly believe.  Their love of life and people shines through in this documentary.  Their story will make you laugh, cry and rejoice.  Their love of life and the changes and challenges it presents are inspirational.  Not only is this informative but entertaining as well.  Highly recommended and a documentary you can watch several times and still enjoy.",1372032000,,709,5.0
