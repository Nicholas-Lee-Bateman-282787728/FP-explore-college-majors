8758712,4,B01EGQPATY,"This is taught compact movie.  Good ensemble cast and great premise in the script.  It seems that the world revolves around this little motel/restaurant/gas station in the middle of the desert.  Reminiscent of ""Petrified Forest"".  Represented by heroes, cowards and the ilk.
A very nice surprise.",1474675200,,296,5.369565217391305
