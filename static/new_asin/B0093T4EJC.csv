8535412,5,B0093T4EJC,"TCM and IMDB offer glowing  reviews but catch themselves then  cast a few weak belated criticisms - so what, it is a 1958 movie after all?! ... Even the subplots ( the architecture, history, generation gap and nationalism ) are powerful bonuses  to the wonderful and humorous drama, irony and pathos with a slight twist at the end.  Any clichs professional critics may have noticed were likely pioneered here and over copied later. It's an eye opener to a past era with dramas we still face today. Mifune aptly balances both the pre-WWII machismo and a deep sensitivity often missed by average movies.",1475798400,,601,4.805825242718447
