8061908,3,B0009JFD2M,"Overall, not bad.  Superman consists of the first three episodes of the Superman animated series, retelling the origin of Superman.  Other than the introduction to that series, it's nothing new to Superman fans, who are better off buying the first season if they are into it.  However, it'll definitely work for kids at an hour long.  Batwoman is a brand new movie from the Batman animated series team, although the animation is different from the original series.  Story wasn't bad, although not the best from this team.  However, it was original enough to be enjoyable, and was definitely worth the watch.  Extras are nice too, especially the highlight on the voice talent, which is a great extra for any cartoon on DVD.  Overall, while I would suggest not buying either separately, I felt this combination was worth it.  Keep rockin' in the free world...",1120694400,2,857,4.895833333333333
