8115123,5,B000EWDFHE,"The Western, one of Gary Cooper's greatest movies, is based on the life and times of the legendary Texas hanging judge, Roy Bean, played by Walter Brennan (who by the way won an Oscar for supporting actor for his role in movie).  A ""must see"" (or have) if you are a Gary Cooper fan...full of action and set in a time of turmultous conflict between settlers and cattlemen.  I guarantee that you will enjoy this movie.  I purchased this DVD and enjoyed the entire process of obtaining it thru Amazon and viewing the DVD on several occasions. Recommend it to any western and especially a Gary Cooper fan.",1367712000,,601,4.546296296296297
