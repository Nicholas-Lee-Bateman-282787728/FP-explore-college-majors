1633394,4,B00005NG04,"This DVD is fueled by the power of discovery. The attractively designed DVD menus offer no information, and the viewer must click on graphics to decipher the many tricks or treats within. And there are plenty! The only criticism is the well-worn, scratched version of Bert I. Gordon's ""Tormented"" (great spook show material). Otherwise, you can spend hours unlocking this disc's secrets.",1008547200,2,387,5.258064516129032
1633395,4,B00005NG04,"For creepy, nostalgic Halloween fun this disk is hard to beat!  Not only do you get a copy of ""TORMENTED"" (in itself worth the price of the disk) but HOURS AND HOURS of spook-show fun from the 20's through the 70's.
""TORMENTED"", starring Richard Carlson, was released by Allied Artists and is an underrated classic.  You may be tempted to draw some similarities between ""Tormented"" and ""House on Haunted Hill"" which was released by the same studio several years before.  The look/feel of the two movies is similar in several respects.
The many classic ghost-show trailers look and sound great, and are classically atmospheric.  The short gimmick film ""MONSTERS CRASH THE PAJAMA PARTY"" is great, silly fun.  When we showed the disk for the kid's Halloween Party, we ""recreated"" the gimmick by having a guy in a mask emerge from a door near the TV, look around the room menacingly, and then ""kidnap"" one of the youngsters and take her back into the room -- all timed to the screen action the way it might have originally played.  Then, once order was restored, we settled down, put on our 3-D glasses and watched ""Asylum of the Insane"".  ""Insane"" appears to be a home-made movie (fun with the movie camera) except that it is in 3-D (anaglyphic process).  Anaglyphic 3-D is not a great process, but the 3-D of ""Insane"" was surprisingly good in places.
I loved the ""soundies"" too.  ""Soundies"" are the forerunner of the music video. Soundies were short musical films which featured popular songs and performers. They date from the era when going to the movies was a complete entertainment package. The soundies on this disk are all ""spooky"" in theme.  My favorite one features a skeleton in high heels.  One small note of concern, the soundies on the dvd, like other popular entertainment of the era, may not be considered politically correct by todays standards.
The DVD has too many treasures to write about all of them, but I especially want to mention the four short ""amateur"" take-off's of  classic Hollywood fright films.  The shorts appear to actually have been made in the 1920's and 30's using home movie equipment.  They are all quite good, surprisingly so.  It's almost like coming across  8mm. home movies that an unknown major director might have made at age 15.
The only criticism I have of this disk is that the material presented on it is relatively without context.  Part of the problem has to do with the menu options.  Although exploring the menu is fun the first time out (like prowling through a haunted house) subsequent viewings render it annoying rather than cute. Also, I found that I craved information about what I was seeing.  For example, who was responsible for the four black and white shorts, and how did they come to be made.  Who are some of these forgotten performers in the soundies, what's their background.  What's the origin of the film ""Asylum of the Insane""?  The lack of context makes the odd juxtopositions odder still as we jump hither and yon between a major Hollywood production and someone's home movies.
With a little imagination, this is the perfect Halloween Party disk.  It should be a family favorite for many Octobers to come.
Recommended co-features: 13 Ghosts (original film in it's new ""Illusion-O"" DVD), House on Haunted Hill (original vers.), Matinee', Terror in the Haunted House (Rhino) and Popcorn (Buy a bag - go home in a box).",1003968000,13,3385,4.798275862068966

Indeed, this DVD release deems the earlier ""Intermission Time - Spook Show Edition"" video virtually worthless.  My one and only regret is that the animated menu screens are likely to baffle many a viewer who attempt to navigate about without any visual guidance other than the faintly highlighted outlines of various ""spooky"" images. In other words, there aren't any words... just retro Halloween-style images... to indicate what to click on.  Aside from being frustrating, my worst fear is that many of the DVD's offerings will go untapped by the viewer unless they closely consult the packaging.  Aside from that, this is a fascinating document of a form of entertainment destined to soon become not even a living memory among most of us.",1000684800,,901,5.026845637583893
1633399,5,B00005NG04,"Something Weird's ""Monsters Crash The Pajama Party Spook Show Spectacular"" is one of the most enjoyable DVD I now own. They perfectly exploit the medium by making every one of the nearly four hours of rare spooky shorts, trailers, and features ""Easter eggs"" that you discover by clicking your way through a haunted house. I don't know where they dug some of this stuff up, but
it's priceless and quite addictive. Alright, so the 3-D short consists of a bunch of kids in rubber masks stabbing at the camera, but it does work. This is one of the most lovingly prepared disks I've seen. I can't imagine a classic horror fan not being delighted by this one.",1000339200,9,653,4.589743589743589
1633418,4,B00005NG04,"When I was a kid, I remember going to the local movie theater, and watching a movie where the film suddenly stops.  Monsters and gorillas come out from behind the curtains, and run into the audience, grabbing screaming girls.  The movie then resumes and quickly ends, to be followed by a feature-length horror movie.  I thought that cinematic curiosity would be a lost film.  Much to my delight, I discovered that ""Monsters Crash The Pajama Party"" (1965) was that same featurette.  Filmed on a shoestring budget, the acting was wooden, the dialog was almost indecipherable, and I loved every minute of it!  None of the multiple bonus features are listed in the menu, so you have to scroll around to find the Easter eggs containing them, which only adds to the fun.  One of the bonuses is the feature-length movie ""Tormented"" (1960).  Co-written and directed by the legendary Bert I. Gordon (a/k/a Mr. Big), it's an entertaining horror/melodrama, with outdated ghostly special effects.  Unfortunately, the video quality is not very good, with lines, scratches and jump cuts.  Considering all that's packed into this DVD for a very low price, it's definitely worth buying.",1454544000,3,1170,5.015544041450777

1633420,4,B00005NG04,"""Monsters Crash the Pajama Party,"" well, this DVD is something else alright. It's a celebration of the good ol' days of Halloween and spook shows. The main feature ""Monsters Crash The Pajama Party"" is about 25 minutes or so long and is ridiculously cheesy. The other feature promoted on the cover is ""Asylum of the Insane"" which is a 10-15 minute clip of 70s kids wearing weird monster masks and stabbing at the camera with various objects. Let's be real here: the 3D sucks though.

There's also a THIRD feature, the 1960 film ""Tormented"" that is hidden on this disc. It's longer than the main presentation and actually, a legit movie.

Included on this disc is also tons and tons of special features, including various clips of random ""spooky"" stuff, a ride through a 1960s carnival ""haunted attraction"" and a long detailed essay on how to put on your own spook show. One of the best features is old, rare footage from the 20s, 30s, and 40s of short films, as well as ""soundies,"" which were musical numbers from various television programs and promotions at the time.

The DVD itself is the best part. NOTHING is labeled and all this stuff is hidden. Part of the fun is clicking on various things in the menu and seeing what comes up.

1633429,5,B00005NG04,"As I look at the reviews posted by the less than satisfied customers I can't help but laugh. What where you all expecting?

""Monsters Crash the Pajama Party"" was an interactive movie from 1965; before VHS existed. In those days, and many before it, there were events called ""The Midnight Spook Show"". While the film would play, actors dressed as monsters and characters from the film would appear and interact with the audience. It was the gimmick of the times that hasn't translated to the modern age of cinema; for better or for worse. Unless you attended one of these Spook Shows, you wouldn't figure out what was going on whilst watching it. That being said, it wouldn't have made ""Monsters Crash the Pajama Party"" any better. It's a bad movie plain and simple, but that's not the point of this DVD.

The special features and Easter eggs are the highlight of the DVD and the main reason to own it. I, like most, have never heard of ""Monsters Crash the Pajama Party"" and for good reason. I first learned about it in the 3rd season of Cinemassare's ""Monster Madness"" and it perfectly summed up what's so great about this little DVD. It's a tribute and collection of vintage Halloween everything; a Spook Show Museum one could say. So when people complain about it, I am genuinely curious to know how they discovered it. Did they just happen to look at it and buy it without looking it up? Even if you did a Google search, the DVD section of its wiki page is made mostly of Cinemassacre.com founder James Rolfe's take on it. A little research beforehand people?

This is a great DVD that's perfect for Halloween and a blast to go treasure hunting through the unmarked menus (which many dislike). That being said, there are a couple things about the DVD I'm a little disappointed by. This appears to be a reprint as there are changes from the 2007 originals. Instead of two pairs of white 3D glasses, there is now only one with pointlessly added colour. And they still don't have temples. Great job guys. It also doesn't have the original booklet. Though that is disappointing, I think most of it was added in electronically on the main menu. I prefer physical stuff but at least I have something. On a final note, the DVD cover is no longer the same. Though Amazon shows the old one, on the DVD I got today, it no longer has the ""Bonus"" and ghost with the ""100% Spooky"" sign in the bottom left. And the DVD logo is no longer on the bottom which is actually a good thing.

Many people have complained that the unmarked menus and overall content is a mess and a joke. I for one love this kind of chaos and the old fashion cheesiness. James Rolfe said it best, ""It's a haunted box of chocolates; you never know what you're gonna get.""",1413849600,3,2732,4.490945674044266

Unlike all other SWV DVD's, this whole disc is like one big easter egg. There are four seperate areas which houses all sorts of zany, spookshow related material. Each area contains a couple of easter eggs.

There's an enclosed booklet that gives a detailed account of the traveling spookshow era. Also, there's two seperate commentary tracks featuring Dr. Evil and Dr. Jekyl. Both are veterans of the spookshow circuit and give a pretty colorful account of the happenings of the time. Dr Evil has a rather strong Southern drawl.

There's a bunch of media related material and how to's on how to stage your own Spook Show. It's interesting to get a taste of the times when you read the detailed intructions. One of the promotions back then was the giving away of a ""dead body"". Also, the primary means of advertising back then for these shows was radio(along with promo cards in the lobby of movie theaters/intermission ads).

Also included are a couple of ""3D"" glasses to view THE ASYLUM OF THE INSANE. I really do appreciate Something Weird bringing back this piece of obscure cinema/stage history.

1633446,5,B00005NG04,"Gear up, this is a long one.

I bought this disc a few weeks ago, but I only recently had the time to sit down and watch it. First of all, you must understand that I am crazy about this sort of stuff. I am too young to remember when midnight spook shows played across the country, but I love getting my hands on anything having to do with them. I love the cheesiness and the spin that promoters would put on these things, and wonder what it would have been like to actually sit through one.

So after reading all these negative reviews, I confess I don't understand their frustration. People's first complaint: the lack of a menu. Another reviewer got it when they said that it's supposed to be like finding your way in a haunted house. Click here or click there, you never know what it's going to be! I loved finding all the icons on the DVD and figuring out where stuff was hidden. If you have a decent memory or just write down the location of your favorite features when you find them, it's not a big deal. I guess some people want everything handed to them easy, including DVD features. Me, I love the idea of an entire disc of easter eggs. It's a different experience every time, which is the idea behind the old spook shows. Get it?

Second complaint: the Something Weird Video logo at the bottom right on nearly every feature. This is justified, as one of the major reasons we buy DVDs is so we don't have to watch movies with a TV station's ID covering a fair portion of the screen. However, I stopped noticing it after about the first 10 minutes. I'm not easily bothered, but I can see why this would upset other people. As someone above me noted, there are times when it's nearly invisible and times when it sticks out like a sore thumb. Hopefully SWV will correct this in future releases.

Third complaint: the quality and artistic merit of the content. Are you kidding me? The whole point of this disc is that it's a time capsule to a long-forgotten, incredibly cheesy era of American theater. The quality shouldn't be considered here, we should be thankful that Something Weird gave us so much on one DVD! Sure, the ""3-D"" feature may be somebody's home movies, and the technology may not translate well to television (although really, did you expect it to work all that great anyway?), but I was thrilled to have it along with the two pairs of classic 3-D glasses. One by one, here's what I think of the content:

The hypnoscope opening - I loved it. It got me in the mood, just like it was supposed to.

Monsters Crash the Pajama Party title feature - To the reviewer who said it was unwatchably bad, you're wrong. Sure, the extended opening bit with a gorilla acting out the parts of everyone involved in the making of the thing gets a little boring, but the show itself has wonderfully bad acting, pointless sound effects (does a university professor's office always sound that windy?), and many moments of unintentional hilarity. I laughed several times and enjoyed it immensely. Besides, it's interesting to see a relic from the ""live monsters grab a girl from the audience"" days.

Asylum of the Insane in 3-D - Boring, overlong, and cheaply made, but hey, free glasses!

Spooks-a-poppin' Trailer Show - I absolutely loved this feature. For some reason, I can't get enough of drive-in intermissions and spook show trailers. I was sad that I got only 45 minutes. Sure, a few images and themes pop up over and over, but if you're like me, you'll be fascinated by the eerie music and the outrageous claims that all these hucksters made to draw in crowds. Fascinating.

Spooky Musical Soundies - Charming, odd, and one of the most entertaining inclusions, these things play like ancient music videos. And who doesn't love a dancing skeleton in heels?

Horror Home Productions - These clips are some of the more interesting bits on the disc, and it's a shame that there's no information on them included anywhere. The musical accompaniment by Something Weird band The Dead Elvi fits the images and the mood nicely.

Don't Be Afraid of the Dark educational short - A random thing to include, but it's worth watching for its time capsule appeal and insight into our earliest PSAs.

Spook House Ride - A home movie kind of clip showing the sights inside a carnival haunted house. Cheap and charming.

Drive-in Werewolf - The guy's muttering as he ""transforms"" had me howling with laughter, but the clip is cut short. Seems to be added as an extra purely for extra's sake.

Stills Gallery - 300 rare posters and lobby cards tracked with radio-spot promos from the time. Very cool to look at, but a click-through option would have been nice. The feature rumbles through each picture at its own pre-set speed.

How to Put On Your Own Spook Show - Informative and useful, for me anyway. A step-by-step guide to pulling off a few simple tricks.

Tormented feature - a 72-minute film from 1960 with predictably lousy acting and story, although the direction hints at occasional greatness. A few scenes are genuinely impressive.

Secrets of the Spook Show enclosed booklet - A great read, and short enough to be read in a few minutes. Jim ""Mad Doctor"" Ridenour shares his story of how he became, as those in the business called it, a ghostmaster.

There are other hidden snippets scattered about the menu. They're mainly there to fill up space (in fact, two of them are shorter clips of material found elsewhere on the disc), but a few are so unexpected and strange that I laughed upon first discovering them. In any case, they add to the DVD's surreal nature.

As stated above, those who reviewed this disc negatively either didn't understand what Something Weird was going for with their execution, or got hung up on mostly trivial issues. While I've never had the opportunity to attend a real live spook show, I believe that this disc accurately presents the strangeness, randomness, and humor that characterized so many of them from the 30s to the 60s. There are some things that could have been done better, but hopefully, Something Weird will correct them in the next Spook Show Spectacular, which I'm hoping very much they make. I recommend this DVD highly, and hope that you enjoy it as much as I do.",1238716800,8,6212,4.6105072463768115
1633447,4,B00005NG04,"OK, so if you're thinking of buying this, you're probably already a fan of schlock horror, or know someone who is. This is a fun DVD, though I doubt you'll be returning to it over and over again. The bizarre menu system is part of the allure, I would say - I get the feeling they were trying to replicate the experience of fumbling your way through a haunted house, not knowing what will turn up next. Some of the extras are literally a few seconds long and will have you going, ""Huh?"" A skull that says ""Cool it, baby"". An ape operating a movie camera. A decapitated ghost head spooking her (I assume) ex-husband. In places, it's like they swept the cutting room floor and threw them into this DVD, as the connections are tenuous at best. '3D' home movies, silent amateur horror productions, old Halloween jazz numbers, a government information film for children telling them it's OK to be scared... It's all here.

That said - I like it! I see this as a fun DVD to throw in to 'scare' the kids at Halloween (there's no gore that I found), though depending on their age, they may see it as more humorous than scary, in a post-ironic way. (Little kids might find some of the rubber masks too frightening though.)",1235692800,4,1212,4.434977578475336

Terrific trailers, shorts, ads, 3-D, & a cool feature w/ Richard Carlson certainly provide loads of bang for your buck. It all comes together to provide an excellent example of those live spook shows of yesteryear. The menu, which some have complained about, is a gas. It is set up to lead you through a haunted maze where you don't know what will pop up around the next corner. For me, this is Something Weird's finest hour. Hours of fun are provided with superior quality presentations of dated material. One from the vaults, I must recommend it to all horror fans.",1207008000,8,705,4.693548387096774
1633449,4,B00005NG04,"because there sure are alot of crybabies reviewing this one! ;)

something weird video, as they frequently are, completely and totally misunderstood and undervalued.

that's a real shame.

""monsters crash the pajama party"" is an idea. it's an inside joke. it's a lifestyle. you're either in, or you ain't.

the TOTAL JOY of this dvd is that you get LOST.

you're looking for one thing, and you end up someplace else. you watch things two and three times, totally confused and baffled that you uncovered the wrong egg- and it's a rotten one.

tell me that you get it. please.

you are in the funhouse, and you are totally LOST. that is the whole point.

point the zapper and get lost. enjoy the ride. some of it is brilliant, some of it sucks, but, hello........ when you went to a triple feature, that is what you got! if you went to the drive-in..... that's what ya got! a mixed bag, some of it mint, most of it cut all to hell- but always a good time.

bon appettite!",1191024000,4,969,4.398876404494382
1633470,1,B00005NG04,"Let me begin by ANSWERING where to find the menu:

This disc doesn't have one! HOWEVER if you look this title up on the Internet Movie DataBase, and go to the discussion board, a frustrated fan and viewer has posted a painstaking (and if you have tried to watch this DVD even once, you will understand how much trouble he went through), illustrated page-by-page guide to navigating the hidden menu items.

He posts a written description of each page, the icon and what it leads to and a puckish description of what the clip or feature is.

Now, as to the DVD itself, I would give this disc NO stars at all if I could simply because it has the ABSOLUTE WORST menu concept of all time: multiple, ""Easter Egg"" style pages with no words and no indication of where to find them until you -often accidentally- highlight or click them.

That said, I actually thoroughly enjoyed the content (once I could find it). The retro charm of the teasers and promos of the bygone 20-60's reveal something of the innocence of those times, as well as the less sophisticated promotional techniques.

I have to admit that the 3-D home movies were utterly lame and were probably included just because they were there and somebody said ""Why not use the 3-D as a selling point?""

Not to be overlooked, however, is the old home movie footage from the late 20's-very early 30's of some teenagers doing their own version of London After Midnight. This was a pre-Dracula vampire movie -now lost- but the historic value of seeing this period spoof of it is considerable.",1188000000,6,1541,4.605839416058394
1633471,4,B00005NG04,"This DVD is a mishmash. A low-rent theatrical short here, a trip through a carnival haunted house there, some still shots of old spookshow posters in between. In fact, ""Monsters Crash the Pajama Party"" is nearly impossible to describe. It's not a feature film, though there is a feature (""Tormented"") included somewhere on the disc. Nor is it primarily about the title segment, a short monster/comedy flick starring a bunch of college kids and a mad scientist. Instead, it's almost as if the entire DVD is made up of extras. But what a great collection of extras it is! For one low price, you get monsters, happenin' 60s co-eds, horrible narration, REALLY bad acting, a bit of 3-D, a guy in a bargain-basement gorilla outfit and a whole lot more! Watching this disc feels like channel surfing in a world in which the Cramps run all the TV stations. It's like watching snippets of movies made by people who...well...wish they could make better movies. The result? It's absolutely, over-the-top brilliant; a patchwork of lowbrow cinema that will leave you wondering, ""Where the heck did this stuff ever play??""

My only complaint about this disc (and I'm docking it a whole star for this) is that it's REALLY hard to navigate! The viewer is pretty much left to just stumble onto various scenes by trial and error. It's an amazing collection of clips and snippets overall, but this thing should have come with a map.",1109203200,41,1413,4.790983606557377
1633472,1,B00005NG04,"This DVD is so hard to navigate, it's nearly unwatchable, and extremely frustrating. The viewer is promted through a series of arcade-type mazes and must click on pictures within each scene to view chapters.  Chapters aren't named, so even getting to ""Monsters Crash the PJ Party"" feature is major undertaking. In two chapters, ""Monsters Crash..."" shows while an old radio show plays over the feature.  In two others, the viewer is shown still clips of instructions that are meant to pull off a gag stunt on a city-wide basis - - ""How to Bury Someone Alive,"" and something else.  Neither stunt would fly in todays modern scene.  Instructions could probably be found on the net in 2 minutes, while getting to them via the DVD would take more like 50 minutes.

I used to think Director Ed Wood's ""Plan 9 Form Outer Space"" was the worst movie ever made, but ""Monsters Crash the Pajama Party"" has given me pause for thought.",1102118400,2,920,4.6894409937888195
1633473,4,B00005NG04,"...especially those who love horror films or Halloween. Sure the material is cheesy;it's supposed to be. This DVD is the most fun I've had where searching for contents is concerned as virtually all items are in the form of horror easter eggs. The only quibble I have is that some of the actual hidden easter eggs should have been unseen material, as opposed to quick clips of material already on the disc. The kind of DVD I would probably view and have fun with a few times a year. Worth it alone for all the classic horror artwork featured in most of the material...",1088035200,2,567,4.461538461538462
1633474,3,B00005NG04,"I chose the title of the review based on one thing only: it was the most entertaining line from the entire DVD. I am a big Something Weird fan, and almost always love their work, but this time I have to make an exception. This DVD is really pretty boring, except for the drama of 'Tormented' and the lowbrow comedy of 'Monsters Crash The Pajama Party'. Since 'Monsters Crash The Pajama Party' was selected as the title for the DVD, let's begin there. The story is basically this: five sorority pledges stay in a haunted house and fall victim to the resident mad doctor (we know this because ""Mad Doctor"" is emblazoned on his lab coat.) There is much wackiness foisted on the audience over the next 30 minutes, including men in gorilla suits, women in chains, a werewolf in polka dotted boxer shorts, a laser cannon that seemingly has no point, and police detectives summoned to investigate it all because of a noise complaint. The film ends in absolute mid-action when a monkey bangs a gong, and it's suddenly over; no climax, no denouement, nothing. The best part of the film are some fairly entertaining credits done with guys in gorilla suits at the opening. It is campy fun that is timed just right at 30 minutes; any more would be pushing the limits. Besides 'Tormented' this is easily the best thing on the DVD.
Seemingly out of place to me on the disc is 'Tormented' a feature length psychological drama of love torn asunder in a lighthouse by Bert I. Gordon, who for once uses characters of normal size. 'Tormented' is well made and fairly creepy, and therefore not really in keeping with the rest of the DVD, which is thematically tied to spook shows of the 1920s to 1960s. I like 'Tormented,' and that (plus some funny camp value points from 'Monsters Crash The Pajama Party') is what brought this DVD up to three stars for me.
Now that I have discussed the good, let's turn to the bad. In any discussion of the bad features of this DVD, the logical place to start is the index. This DVD has the worst designed, most irritating and utterly pointless index system I have ever seen. Some people seem to like the 'hidden Easter egg' charm of this index, but most people will hate it. Let me explain. The index has no words, merely symbols like a bat or a headstone to select the features. This means that there is absolutely no way to find what you are looking for other than by random chance. To further aggravate the viewer, there are multiple sub-menus of index functions, meaning that the search is even more aggravating than it even sounds. I will never watch this DVD again for that reason alone.
There is a short feature, wholly inappropriately titled 'The Asylum of the Insane'. It is in 3-D, and (very cheap) glasses are provided, but it doesn't really matter, as the 3-D does not work on a television, but gave me a big time headache (or perhaps it's the content that did it...) This movie is not terribly horrifying inasmuch as it consists of ten minutes of some kids throwing a football around, an old guy doing yo-yo tricks, and a some teenagers in Halloween masks poking baseball bats and hatchets at the camera. To exacerbate the 'horror', there is the bonus of no sound, so it's really a silent movie of a Saturday afternoon with some adolescent boys. It is the most utterly pointless piece of celluloid ever exposed to the light of day.
There are scads of other, unrelated things, like some bad horror shorts from the 1920s to 1960s set to the tune of ""Little Jack-o-lantern"" sung by 'The Dead Elvi'. There are some amazingly boring audio tracks superimposed over random other things like stills and spook show art (this gets tedious...there are 300 stills in this section), there is a ride through a fun house, something called 'Chased By Monsters', that I never grasped it's reason for existing, and it's all introduced by the amazing 'Hypnoscope,' an effect used much more effectively by Ray Dennis Steckler in 'The Incredibly Strange Creatures Who Stopped Living And Became Mixed Up Zombies.' There is also a documentary named 'Don't Be Afraid', about fearing darkness, but honestly after looking over and over through that stupid menu, I could never find it, so I really can't tell you anything about it.
This DVD was supposed to be fun. Instead, all I felt was 'Tormented'.",1085356800,11,4303,4.64089121887287
1633475,4,B00005NG04,"This was great fun, and if you are a theater historian, look no further-the booklet, trailers, and ads alone are worth the price of the package.  Its hard to believe how big spook shows were from the 20's-60's, but forgotten now-the booklet was a great read!  But the menus are a nightmare when trying to find a favorite section-you'll probably have to make notes and tuck them in the case, like I did.  The logos are a pain as well, but I've seen this material pirated, so SW has their reasons.  Enjoy!",1070409600,4,503,4.434782608695652
1633476,3,B00005NG04,"First off, 99% of the people out there should skip this DVD. The movies are awful, and the 3-D does not work very well on TV. But if you are interested in the traveling spook shows (also called ghost shows) of the forties and fifties, then this DVD is a goldmine. A couple great interviews with ex-spook show performers, lots of poster art, trailers, and old instructions on how to make some of the effects. Getting to all of these features requires some bind clicking, but that is part of the fun. It's like finding secret doorways in an old house. If you have no interest in the bygone ghost shows of the middle part of the last century, then, by all means, steer clear of this DVD.",1068768000,4,684,4.3515625

It's a treasure hunt through a haunted house that you experience by clicking your remote control. There are tons of Easter eggs here with theatrical featurettes and promos a-plenty! Of course, the 30+ minute farce MONSTERS CRASH THE PAJAMA PARTY is so bad, it makes Ed Wood look like Spielberg. This is a loving ""retro-mentary"" on the old spook shows that movie houses used to present live onstage with a horror feature; magic shows, monsters, ghosts in the audience and scads of ghoulish fun all meant for the kids! There's no friggin' way any theater these days would have the guts to do this stuff without worrying about getting reprimanded by some activist group.

1633478,1,B00005NG04,"I was so excited when I bought this disc. I felt different when I first watched the first hour of it.
  First of all, it's hard to get to the different parts of the disc because of the invisible icons on the menus.
  Second, the ""SWV"" logo is so very annoying when watching most of the features.
  Third, it looks like someone just threw some home movies together and put them on this DVD.
  The 3-D short is very misleading. It shows some kids throwing a football around and wearing masks stabbing at the camera with knives.
  I had to fast forward through ""The Monsters Crash the Pajama Party."" It's a lousy film that shouldn't have been released. It makes the Monkees TV series look good.
  I thought that this would be a good DVD, since this is the same Video Company that released the psychedelic double feature DVD ""Mondo Mod"" and ""The Hippie Revolt."" Boy, was I disappointed with this turkey.
  I urge all of you to avoid this disc. The only thing spooky about this DVD is the money that will be missing from your wallet from buying this false advertised bomb. I guess I could use this DVD as a mini-Frisbee.",1024272000,5,1115,4.401960784313726
1633479,3,B00005NG04,"This DVD package overall was a big letdown. Some of the Spook Show content is interesting, mainly the coming attractions trailers and poster/still gallery, and the Monsters Crash Pajama Party short is good for a few cheap laughs. But most of the rest of it, other than the feature Tormented (which almost seems thrown in as an afterthought), is utterly dispensable. At least I think so, since there is no background material or context given as to what most of it is or what its significance might be. That's maddening enough, then add to that the fact that nothing is listed by name in the menus; if you're looking for anything in particular, you have to randomly click around to find it, hoping to remember where you found it last time. Apparently other reviewers found this ""fun""; I found it merely tedious and frustrating. Then Something Weird adds insult to injury by plopping their (crappy-looking) logo in the lower corner of all the ""extras,"" annoying the viewer/consumer even further. SW obviously doesn't ""get"" DVD; we don't want to pay twenty bucks to have to sit and look at corporate logos; yeccchh!! And I had always thought they were a pretty cool company.
OK, to be honest, I bought this disc partly just to get a halfway-decent (I hoped) copy of Tormented anyway. (Was this flick shown a lot at 1960s spook shows? Again, no context or information as to why it's on this disc.) While no classic, Tormented is schlocky fun, and interesting if only to see producer/director Bert I. Gordon (creator of such squeaky-clean SF fare as Attack of the Puppet People and Earth vs. the Spider) working in sleazy ""Adults Only"" mode. Richard Carlson, usually the whitebread hero in these things, also plays against type as a philandering creep, a jazz pianist who allows his well-stacked mistress Vi (Juli Reding) to fall to her death after she threatens his upcoming marriage to Meg Hubbard (Lugene Sanders). Gordon inflicts his annoying daughter Susan (she gets second billing!) on us as Sandy, Meg's daughter, compensating somewhat with some cool modern jazz on the soundtrack. Sharp-eyed (and -eared) TV addict viewers will recognize the faces and voices of blind Mrs. Ellis (Lillian Adams) and Frank Hubbard (Harry Fleer) from their bit parts in hundreds of other movies and TV shows. Some of the ""special effects"" (e.g. the footsteps) are inexcusably cheesy, and the attempt to make seaweed an object of horror fails miserably. But I love the surreal (and fairly well-done) sequences of Vi's disembodied hand and head haunting Carlson, and B-movie veteran Joe Turkel (The Killing, Blade Runner, Cycle Psycho, The Shining, etc., etc.) is a scream as the jive-talking slimeball blackmailer. All in all, plenty of cheesy, trashy fun for bad movie aficionados.
Unfortunately, SW Video again underwhelms with the quality of the source print. Although the grayscale, sharpness, and detail are acceptable, if unremarkable, there is nearly-constant light to moderate speckling and spotting, recurrent light vertical scratching, several messy reel changes, and a number of annoying jump cuts, particularly during the finale. At least they leave their stinkin' logo off the feature! Right now if you want this movie on DVD it's this or Madacy's Drive-In Double Feature version (which I have not seen but can probably be assumed is even worse based on other discs of theirs I have seen). This is probably the better deal even at the higher price since you get the Spook Show stuff with it, but it's hard to endorse purchase of this disc, considering all its flaws, unless you're really dying for the content. Four stars for the movie Tormented, three stars for the Spook Show content, two stars for the disc design, authoring, and overall quality. Note to Something Weird: pick up a few recent  Anchor Bay or Image releases and see how DVD is done.",1010188800,8,3846,4.953560371517028
