I suppose that was a true story other wise it might had had a better ending, how sad, the people should have been hung themselves!  I would love to have it but not for $22.98.",1263859200,,342,3.985294117647059

419886,4,6302034922,I have been a fan of the stage for several decades and have seached high and low for a copy of this production. I saw it on ebay several times for hundreds of dollars but finally it has been made available to all. If you are a lover of great stage performances than this dvd is for you. It has been missing from my collection far to long. You see the late great Jack Lemmon at his best (on stage) and a young raw Kevin Spacey (he even has hair) working togther on stage. Then add Peter Gallagher and Bethel Leslie and you have some of the great stage performers of our time. I missed this one live - don't know how - but still kicking myself. Great to see it on DVD for generations to enjoy.,1130284800,7,691,4.0510948905109485
419887,4,6302034922,"Jack Lemmon is brilliant in this 1987 television production of Eugene O'Neill's 1940 play as the patriarch of a severely dysfunctional family, James Tyrone--a former actor and now an emvbittered man in his 60s. His wife, Mary, played quite well by Bethel Leslie, is a morphine addict. His older son, Edmund, is consumptive but says he has ""a bad cold"". And his younger son, Jamie, is hard bitten, cynical--a chip off the old block. Jamie's bitterness echoes his father's in another way--he's a failed actor.

Edmund is played by Peter Gallagher. It's a little off-putting to connect a man with consumption to an actor with such a strapping frame. In spite of that, Gallagher does do a good job. The only somewhat false note, unfortunately, is supplied by Kevin Spacey as Jamie who turns in a somewhat one-dimensional performance. His cynicism comes through, but he doesn't shake that. Even when his lines indicate he's softened a little, trying to convey that he does in fact have some sympathy for his brother or his father, it still sounds aggressive. This was near the start of his professional acting career, so perhaps it's understandable.

The production itself, however, is first-rate. The director, Jonathan Miller, startled audiences by staging the play in such a way that there is often overlapping dialogue. This happens most often when two members of the family are arguing with each other, which is decidedly realistic. In an extremely intriguing one-hour audio interview that comes as a bonus on this DVD, Miller talks about this technique of overlapping dialogue. He is a brilliant man--both a medical doctor and a stage/opera director--and listening to him is a real pleasure.

There is also a one-hour audio interview with Kevin Spacey. Nowhere near as captivating as the interview with Miller, it is still of interest, particularly when Spacey recounts several anecdotes about his relationship with Jack Lemmon, who he considers a mentor.

The overlapping dialogue technique startled not only the audience, but also critics, many of whom lambasted Miller for this. After all, the playwright is O'Neill, an American institution. But personally, I think Miller did a terrific job. It's somewhat difficult to listen to endless dialogue from a dysfunctional family; this technique of having the characters talk over each other is exactly what dysfunctional family members would do in real life and it juices up the proceedings, makes the audience sit up and pay attention. I think it's perfect.

In fact, when you see and hear Long Day's Journey for the first time and you realize it was written in 1940, you realize just how far ahead of his time O'Neill really was. The substantial spate of plays and films that have been staged, produced, and released since that time with a dysfunctional family as the theme have testified to exactly how prescient and attuned the playwright was to the real core of American life--life as it's lived day to day in the home.

This is a brilliant play with a marvelous production. Lemmon is phenomenal; Leslie is great. Gallagher is very good and Spacey gives it a good try. Were it not for the somewhat weaker elements, this would be a five-star rating.

Still highly recommended.",1127606400,16,3230,5.014925373134329
419888,4,6302034922,"This is a wonderful interpretation of O'Neill's transcendental autobiographical work. The cast is fine, but a less ""performed"" example of Long Day's Journey into Night does exist. The 1962 film by Sidney Lumet actually succeeds more as a drama and as a glimpse into a tortured reality. It is hard to explain. It's like seeing Shakespeare acted out instead of embraced and performed. This newer cast acts the story. The Lumet cast lives the story. They breathe it. They are not actors cast in a show. They are the O'Neill family. Even the filming itself becomes an active part of the Lumet experience. Is buying this version a mistake? Absolutely not. I would just simply recommend taking a look at the Lumet version before deciding.",1118966400,16,732,4.864
419889,5,6302034922,Jack Lemmon rules in this great landmark theatrical production. It's a must see!!!,1117065600,2,82,5.384615384615385

419891,5,6302034922,"One of Eugene O'Neill's finest pieces of work, this play illustrates the friction between a demanding father and his sons, as well as the devastating effects of illness, both mental and physical, that afflict the family.  Jack Lemmon, quite possibly one of the most charming and versatile actors in American cinema, creates a superb patriarch in James Tyrone.  The underappreciated Peter Gallagher (American Beauty; Sex, Lies, & Videotape) also plays against type, portraying the fragile and sickly Edmund.  Kevin Spacey is wonderful (but isn't he always?)as Jamie Tyrone (James Jr.).  What makes Spacey so especially good is that he doen't overact in a role that is incredibly meaty (and could tempt lesser actors to do so).  Bethel Leslie also stars as Mary Tyrone, the mother attempting to cope with the intense pressures around her, and paying dearly for it.  Thw whole tape is heartbreaking.  This was a great adaptation.  Too bad the cassette's so ...expensive!",1013385600,8,967,5.193548387096774
419892,5,6302034922,"This is the way Eugene O'Neill wanted this play performed.  Its presentation on video still leaves one feeling as if you are watching O'Neill in the wings directing every move.
This is clearly Jack Lemons's very best role, and Kevin Spacey's first clear indication that he is a superb dramatic actor.  It also has Peter Gallagher, who seems as comfortable in musicals as in this demanding dramatic role.",1001376000,5,403,4.911764705882353
7820509,5,6302034922,"This is the best version of Long Day's Journey Into Night that I have seen.  Jack Lemmon's acting is perfect.  There is a stage set, the lights are low and the subject is depressing.  Somehow the play is not depressing.  In this version you are captivated by the superb dialogue. I had seen this on You Tube and asked for it as a birthday present.  The relative gave me the movie version with Katherine Hepburn.  I watched the DVD and it was not as engaging as Long Day's Journey Into Night starring Jack Lemmon.  I know I won't watch the Katherine Hepburn movie twice, I imagine I'll watch the version with Jack Lemon at least once a year from now on.",1501545600,,652,4.338842975206612
7820510,2,6302034922,"The lack of stars is not due to the material.  The play is one of the greatest in American Theater - the direction of this production, however, is utterly horrible.  Jonathan Miller decided that it might be thrilling to have characters talk over one another's lines, I suppose in an effort to ""jazz up"" the drama, to heighten the tension.  All it does is distract from O'Neill's beautifully riveting dialogue.  Imagine if Miller tried the same thing with, say, Hamlet, so that in the bedroom scene of Act 4 Hamlet and Gertrude spoke their respective lines simultaneously.  Make sense?  Of course not.  Now O'Neill is not Shakespeare but his text should garner the same respect as any other dramatist.  I do not fault the actors who do the best they can (yet Lemmon, true to form, hams it up with all he has - there's never a moment when he's in camera range that he isn't muttering, gesturing, raising his eyebrows, scratching himself, etc. - Jesus Jack stay still for a moment will you!).
  But the constant yelling back and forth at each other while others are yelling over them is shameful to the play and the playwright.  Please avoid this production if you love the play and believe, as I do, that ALL of O'Neill's lines should be heard.  I would recommend either the Olivier or the Richardson version - the latter gets the slight edge as Jason Robards essays Jamie in that production.",1467331200,,1390,4.628571428571429

7820513,3,6302034922,"Much as I love Jack Lemmon, he does not possessed of (or at least call upon) nearly enough voices for this role (see Olivier's and Ralph Richardson's versions, instead), while Bethel Leslie appears to have only the one: unbearably shrill. Gallagher and Spacey provide all the class in terrific performances matched only by the 1962 Hollywood version featuring Jason Robards and Dean Stockwell, still the champ among those readily available for purchase.",1442016000,,453,5.305555555555555
7820514,5,6302034922,"Yes, it's almost 3 hours long. Yes, it's just 4 chemically altered characters alternating between yelling at each other and doing pages-long soliloquies. Yes, they never leave the single set. And you know what? It's amazing. This is literally master class in acting. Eugene O'Neill is a tough slog, but it was totally worth it to see these 4 inhabit the roles. Don't try to compare it to the 1962 Katharine Hepburn film version... this one is like going to the theater, without having to leave your couch.",1414281600,,505,4.75
