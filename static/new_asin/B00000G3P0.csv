1216156,5,B00000G3P0,"This is the first Sesame Street video I bought for my 20 month old. She loves it, and I enjoy watching it too. The song, ""This Little Piggie"" is hillarious.  It keeps her attention and I have even noticed her starting to sing along and dance too. We have watched it many times and my daughter does not seem to have lost any interest. It has been such a hit I am looking for other Sesame Street videos to add to my collection.",997747200,4,425,4.120481927710843
1216157,5,B00000G3P0,Actually... it's all of them!  And this video has them!  The whole Sesame Street gang takes turns singing famous childrens songs - perfect for short attention spans and energetic toddlers.  I highly recommend this tape not only for its entertainment but also for it's educational value.,973900800,7,286,5.173913043478261
1216158,5,B00000G3P0,"What makes this video so good? 1.  Elmo!  who needs a better reason?  Not my 17 month old daughter!  Ok, maybe the parents need more reasons... 2.  Lots of classic kids' tunes! 3.  Teaching counting backwards from 10 to 1 (lots of times!) 4.  For those of you who haven't figured it out yet, The Alphabet Song, Twinkle Twinkle, and Baa Baa Black Sheep use the same melody. (I'm ashamed at how old I was when I figured this out!) 5.  A Bob Dylan wannabe singing Old MacDonald on the radio at the beginning.  (this had my 40-something sister and me in stitches!) What, you need more reasons??? How about it's good, CLEAN fun in video and relatively inexpensive?  Or that, as with just about anything Sesame Street, it appeals to a wide range of age groups with short segments, constantly changing?
Not convinced?  Ok, buy it yourself--you'll see!",973209600,44,844,4.597315436241611
1216159,5,B00000G3P0,"The premise of this tape is that Elmo has been asked to do a ""Top Ten Countdown"" on the radio, so all of the sesame street characters want to be sure that their favorite song is included in the ""Top Ten.""  As Elmo travels around Sesame Street, each of them sings their favorite song to (or with) him.
Our two year old is mildly interested in Sesame Street but she seems to really enjoy this tape.  The music is lively and there's enough going on to hold a toddler's attention.  The tape contains several classic children's songs such as ""Row, Row, Row Your Boat"", and ""I've Been Working on the Railroad.""  Throughout the tape, the concept of counting down (from 10 to 1) is repeated either by Elmo or a couple of short cartoons.  Overall, I highly recommend this tape.
The only negative comment that I have is that the first several minutes of the tape contains ads for other Sesame Street tapes.  I find this to be annoying because you have to fast-forward through them each time you want to play the tape.  If they have to include them, I wish that they'd put them at the end of the tape.",971049600,88,1090,4.366336633663367

1216161,5,B00000G3P0,"This video taught my 20 month old daughter how to sing the alphabet song!  She marches around the house singing her ABC's, thanks to Telly.  The rest of the songs are non-annoying; I would highly recommend this video.",960940800,,217,4.684210526315789
1216162,4,B00000G3P0,"This is a nicely structured video that gives Mom and Dad a break from ""Rubber Ducky,"" ""Elmo's Song,"" and other Sesame Street classics.  My 21-month-old son really enjoys hearing his favorite Sesame  Street characters sing songs that his mommy sings too, like ""Baa Baa  Black Sheep"" and ""Row, row, row your boat.""  It also throws  in a nice counting lesson.",953596800,3,356,4.866666666666666

If you are like me, I am sure you will remember singing these same songs when you were young. The songs are more of the traditional fun songs you learn like ""Baa Baa Black Sheep""  and ""She'll be Coming Around the Mountain"".

I wanted to get him a video but has never really watched sesame street. The few times he has watched Sesame Street he becomes disinterested fast. He loved Sesame Street Live and some other sesame street shows when he went to those and since they do not sell the videos of those, I was looking for something similar to that. This is nothing like the shows (I did not expect to be, but I thought the singing would interest my son). He likes the video - its definitely not his favorite thing (he would much rather watch the sesame street live videos on youtube). I think for $5 its a good buy.",1468972800,,704,4.423076923076923

There's lots of cute song and dance numbers with Muppets and kids, all built around timeless classic kids songs.

The ending has a cute switch as well.

At 13 months he not only watches the DVD, but also dances and sings (a few words) along. The reasons we couldn't give more stars are the ads, the picture quality, and the fact that these are just clips of parts of each song.

The minute the DVD came on and he heard the music, he stood up and just stared at the TV screen.  This DVD had his attention 100%.  His eyes were glued to the TV.  He didn't move or blink.  I knew he really liked it.  He started smiling and moving to the music.  He is almost 3 now and to this day, HE STILL LOVES THIS DVD.  Whenever he comes to visit, he'll say, ""Grandma, ELmo, Elmo.""  I'll ask him, ""You want to watch Elmo?""  He'll say yes.  He'll watch the DVD several times a day.  So by now, he knows the words to a lot of the songs, like ""Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star"" and ""Baa Baa Black Sheep, Have You any Wool"".

1216697,3,B00000G3P0,"Most DVDs my toddler has (Baby Signing Time, Yo Gabba Gabba) start automatically after commercials/trailers and loop. This makes it so that the parent doesn't have to stand by the TV for 2-3 minutes to press ""play"" on the DVD player, and then have to do this 25 minutes later when my toddler wants to re-watch it. Unfortunately, this DVD doesn't have that usable set-up suitable for youngsters who I don't trust with the remote. My toddler doesn't watch a lot of videos, but when he does, it's not because I feel like babysitting a DVD. We watch these Sesame Street/Elmo DVDs less just because the set-up/menu is rather annoying.

I was expecting that the video would cover Sesame Street favorites, but it covers more traditional children's songs (like those Barney and Friends would cover): Twinkle Twinkle Little Star, I've Been Workin' on the Railroad, etc. It's done in a cute-ish/mildly annoying way, but it isn't a way to introduce my child to the show and songs I grew up loving.",1377475200,,986,4.766081871345029

We love Elmo in our house and this dvd was a great addition to our collection.  But my only complaint is that I don't think the title is accurate.  It should be called ""Elmo learns to count backwards from 10 to 1 while singing a few songs"".  I was disappointed that this show didn't have any guest appearances and that the focus was all about counting.  Which is great, I just feel that the title is misleading.

I was in the shower singing it. I'm humming songs under my breath while waiting to check out groceries. Yes, it's short. I'm a TV Nazi so I don't mind.

Granted, the songs on this video are not my favorites. Many of them are nursery rhymes, such as ""Baa, Baa, Black Sheep,"" or ""classics"" such as ""Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star,"" which don't really hold my interest.  But my son enjoys them. In addition, the Count does a cute number called ""These Old Bats"" (instead of ""This Old Man""), and the Oinker Sisters' rendition of ""This Little Pig Goes to Market"" is just wonderful.

My biggest complaint, and it's not much of one, is that the musical plot is really a numbers plot centering around counting backwards from ten to one. Obviously, my 18 month old isn't ready for that and it doesn't hold his interest at all. Had I realized this ahead of time, I might not have bought this particular video. But I consider this mainly my fault for not researching it properly (the reviews on Amazon, for example, make this plot very clear).",1168214400,50,1071,4.567708333333333

1217022,4,B00000G3P0,"This is an excellent video.

I used to loathe Elmo.  His squeaky voice and sudden dominance of Sesame Street made me long for the old days of an unseen Snuffleupagus and a mean-spirited Oscar the Grouch.  Never did I expect to find him not only enjoyable but the most well-rounded character on Sesame Street.  It probably helps that my kid turns out to love the little red monster.

The story begins with Gordon and a cadre of kids and Muppets fixing a bike and listening to the Bob Dylan-esque DJ on the radio.  After a rousing rendition of ""I've been working on the railroad"", the DJ announces Elmo's Top Ten Countdown to be aired later that day.  Zoe asks Gordon what a ""Top Ten Countdown"" is and Gordon mistakes Elmo's countdown for a musical countdown.  The misunderstanding continues until the end when it is revealed that Elmo is simply counting down from 10 to 1.

As the story unfolds, Elmo tries his best to find a quiet spot where he can practice before the show.  Unfortunately, everyone on Sesame Street wants to get their favorite song played on the radio, so they find ways to seek him out and sway his opinion towards their song.

The Count, in a straightforward and pushy manner, disregards Elmo's pleas for privacy and sings ""This old bat"" (a reinterpretation of ""This old man"") up to verse Five.  Snuffalupagus, who appears to be suffering from some sort of severe depression and acts passive-aggressively when Elmo tells him that he's too busy to sing, manages to get Elmo to sing ""Row Row Row Your Boat"".

Later, while Elmo is hiding behind some boxes to practice his counting, Prairie Dawn just happens to be in the area with her singing troupe ""practicing"" their song ""John Jacob Jingleheimer Schmidt"".  Prairie Dawn, who seems to be a posterchild for A-type personalities, puts the pressure to Elmo in the way that only an overbearing pastor's wife can.  Elmo stands around dazed for half the song because he doesn't seem to understand the words.  When he finally does catch the tune, he throws himself into the song with abandon.  He also realizes that the tune lends itself well to counting down from 10 to 1, and he practices his counting to the rhythm of the song.

He peeks in on Big Bird's nest to see if he can find a quiet place to continue practicing his counting, but Big Bird has also heard about the Top Ten Countdown and is hard at work prepping his Birdkateers for their presentation of ""She'll be coming 'round the mountain"".  Elmo just can't catch a break.

During all this hiding and seeking, Telly is trying to determine his favorite song.  He starts off thinking that the Alphabet Song is his favorite, but is unsure as he is also very fond of Twinkle Twinkle Little Star.  Just as he is about to decide on Twinkle, he bumps into a black lamb who greets him with ""Bye bye, Telly"" ('bye' is pronounced 'baa').  Telly unwittingly falls into the rascal's trap and responds with ""Bye bye, black sheep"", and his confidence in his favorite song wavers again.

As Elmo is about to go on the air, everyone on Sesame Street gathers around the main square to hear the radio.  Telly, with favorite song in hand, arrives last and is disappointed that he can't present it to Elmo.  Instead, he decides to present it to everyone else.  The ""Alpha-Baa-Baa-Twinkle"" Song.  Prairie Dawn, sitting at the piano, curtly quips ""that's weird"".  What follows is a butchering of the three songs that needs no mention here.  It's apparent that no one liked it, but Gordon, nice guy that he is, tells Telly that he thought it was pretty good.  Everyone else, in a 180 degree turn, suddenly agrees and praises the song when just two seconds earlier they were making disapproving looks.

Then Elmo counts down.  Everyone listening joins in at Gordon's urging.

The real stars of this show are Gordon, who keeps everyone civil and friendly, Telly, whose constant waffling lets us hear three great songs, and Elmo, who despite being put upon by everyone on Sesame Street, throws himself wholeheartedly into every situation and still manages to count down perfectly on his radio show.

My kid can't get enough of Elmo, and his positive attitude and willingness to speak his mind have changed my mind about him.  I totally recommend this video.",1139270400,12,4255,4.6796769851951545

You should note however that the DVD features mainly popular children's songs like Twinkle Twinkle, She'll Be coming Round the Mountain, Baa Black Sheep etc, NOT Sesame Street originals. Also since the story line is based on Elmo doing a ""countdown"" on the radio, the DVD repeatedly counts backward from 10 to 1, so if you have toddlers who are learning to count you may or may not find this to be a beneficial thing, becasue it may confuse them or help them depending on your child.

My next problem is that the DVD is very old. The audio is chalky. The audio quality sounds as if they took an old video tape and digitally recorded it (as opposed to 'digitally remastered').
There is no menu and no chapters. You can't fast forward to the actual movie, you have to manually forward the movie. It's as if they took an old VHS tape and put in your DVD player. One would think that Sony could invest $20 in software to make the few adjustments necessary.

1217130,3,B00000G3P0,"The title says it all.  Whomever did the DVD transfer spent too much time playing with the video portion.  The audio blares and distorts from the git go and doesn't calm down.  Someone forgot how to use a VU meter.  I guess it's OK for kids because they can't tell, but it's the worst audio I've ever heard on a DVD disc.",1016236800,3,321,4.129032258064516
1217131,5,B00000G3P0,"Of all the Sesame Street DVDs that we have, this one is definitely my daughter's favorite.  Though she is only 15 months old, she now sings bits and pieces and hums the tune to several of the songs on here.  When my husband and I try to watch a DVD, she will run over and grab this one and shove at us to put it in so she can watch it.
Unlike some other Sesame Street DVDs, this one actually has somewhat of a plot.  Everyone on Sesame Street thinks that Elmo is going to do a top ten countdown of his favorite songs on the radio, so they all spend the entire time trying to convince him to use their favorite song on the countdown - turns out all Elmo wants is some quiet time so that he can practice his top ten countdown (all he is going to do on the radio is count backwards from 10 to 1.)  The songs on here are some favorite kids' songs - I've Been Working on the Railroad, Baa Baa Black Sheep, The Alphabet Song, Twinkle Twinkle Little Star, Row Row Row Your Boat, She'll Be Comin' Round the Mountain, John Jacob Jingle-Heimer Schmidt, etc.  If you only purchase one Sesame Street DVD, this should be it!",1015200000,205,1111,4.125
1217132,1,B00000G3P0,"I purchased ""Sesame Street - Kids' Favorite Songs"" (part I and II) on Amazon and both the DVDs are in the return box now for the following reasons:
- The songs are performed mostly by Sesame street characters and adults. Kids come and go in some songs, but the songs are not performed by children. My daughter doesn't like characters alone, so she didn't even watch the first song completely.
- There is a lot of talking. I wanted a video with just songs and only songs.
- Since the songs are performed by characters, they are not as musical as the ones performed by children. In some cases, the lyrics are hard to understand because the characters sing too fast and loud.
My daughter wants to watch other children sing and play and learns a lot from it. That is where this DVD set disappointed me. The quality of the DVD and the production are up to Sesame street standards.
In summary, if your kids like Sesame street characters, they would love this video. For me, these DVDs are going back and will be replaced by ""Cedarmont Kids Sing-Along Songs 3 Volume Set"" by TimeLife videos.",1011657600,21,1084,4.50761421319797
1217133,5,B00000G3P0,"My 21 month old daughter is a Sesame Street fanatic and has been since about 12 months old, when she got this tape.  Not only do I love the beginning song (which sounds like Bob Dylan) but all of the songs on this tape are old favorites: ""I've been working on the railroad"", ""Twinkle, twinkle little star"", and my daughter's favorite, ""She'll be coming 'round the mountain"".  In other words, if you are looking for a tape of Sesame Street songs, this is not the tape for you.  Yes, this is a S.S. video, but the songs are kid's favorites, sung by the characters on the show.  When I first popped in the tape, I was expecting ""Rubber Duckie"" and the other cute songs from the show.  However, this is not the case, but is NOT a disappointment.  Sesame Street fans will love singing and dancing along to the video, which is adorable and will be played in your house for a long time.",1010793600,64,879,4.329268292682927
