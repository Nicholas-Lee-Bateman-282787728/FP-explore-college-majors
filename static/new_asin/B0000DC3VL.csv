1923368,5,B0000DC3VL,"The fool who thought the cops should let the bad guys go left out a VERY important piece of information-- no one died but the robbers, but they showed they were willing to kill indiscriminately.  Cops are even allowed to shoot men like this in the BACK-- because IT SAVES FUTURE VICTIMS!
The cops who faced down AK-47s with .38s and shotguns WERE heroes, no two ways about it.  If you can't accept that, move to France.
This is one of the best made for TV cop movies ever made.  Well acted, authentic, and semi-documentary without being stiff or unimaginative.",1076803200,5,560,4.58
1923369,5,B0000DC3VL,"other reviewer says taking down heavy armed bank robbers endangered people.  letting them go could cause a car accident when they escaped.  when they took the mask off the guy who was trying to shoot himself, the hole looked like the guy did shoot himself, though i'm not sure. the action was very good. I'm suprised this was a made for T.V. movie.  The action is kind of like the first scene of Swat with more blood, a lot longer, and just a lot better.",1073088000,5,454,4.317647058823529
1923370,4,B0000DC3VL,"This movie is a hype for the L.A. Police Department. It hypes their heroism. The police officers were hero's, but they also the ones responsible for the shootout. Having fully known the Gunmen were armed with Full Auto AK-47s they decided to engage them openly on the street with Pistols instead of waiting for proper back up.

 Having spent done 2 tours in Vietnam with the 1st Marine Exp. the two things I remember are 1) The Sound of a RUSSIAN AK-47, and 2) that when I'm out gunned, I call in Support. Instead of allowing SWAT who is armed and trained to take down these types of criminals. The John Wayne's of the LAPD created a shootout which resulted in this film. We spend millions in tax dollars on Helicopters, unmarked cars, tracking equipment, and to make our SWAT teams the best in the world. Yet gung ho patrolmen need M16s now?

 Never once in the Film do they tell you that SWAT couldn't get to the Bank, because the Patrolmen had blocked off the FreeWays creating traffic jams. This film also does not show that the L.A.P.D left one of the bank robbers in the street. He was left to bleed to death for 1hr and 4 Minutes. The Police said they thought he was wired with booby traps, yet in the real videos of the Shootout, a Dozen officers beat and strip the robber of his weapons/equipment. This was nothing more then a street justice  execution by the police. Which the L.A.P.D. was sued for. None of this was in the film.

 The film also does not show that after Emil had surrender the SWAT team continued to fire on him. Which can be seen in the real documentary ""North Hollywood Shootout"". It also flat out lied about how Larry Phillips died. In the movie, they show a police detective shoot him before he can commit suicide. In real life we watched live on the news as the man shot himself.

 For entertainment, this movie was done well, for those who do not care about what's hidden from them, you'll enjoy it. I gave this movie 4 stars, because although It had some major mistakes, and important information left out. It was done rather well, those of you who want to watch it just for the shoot out action, you will love it. Those who watch it for information will not.",1072310400,7,2193,4.408415841584159

1923415,4,B0000DC3VL,"I admit to having very low expectations for this movie. It seemed like the sort of cheesy direct-to-video fare that clanks out of the Hollywood sausage machine like...well, so many sausages. And lets face it, Michael Madsen and Mario Van Peebles are precisely the sort of stay-busy actors who will work on any project so long as the check clears. So you can imagine my surprise when I found 44 MINUTES not only better than I thought it would be, but a highly entertaining movie in its own right.

44 MINUTES is the story of the infamous ""North Hollywood Shootout"" which went down outside the Bank of America in North Hollywood in 1997. Two professional bank robbers, Emil (former UFC fighter Oleg Taktarov) and Larry (Andrew Bryniarski) walk into the bank just after it opens on a February morning, planning on being out with the loot in under eight minutes, which is the LAPD's normal response time to a robbery. Unfortunately for them, two police officers who happen to be driving by, crusty Vietnam vet Harris (Ray Baker) and his rookie partner Bobby (Douglas Spain) spot them going in, and call out the cavalry, including world-weary detective Frank McGregor (Madsen), deeply religious street cop Harry (Van Peebles) and troubled, edgy SWAT leader Donnie (Ron Livingston). When the robbers emerge, they find themselves confronted by 40 cops. But as the cops are about to discover, the advantage in numbers doesn't mean anything when the bad guys are packing AK-47s with 100-round magazines and wearing military-grade body armor from necks to knees. As Livingston's character quips, it's a question of ""firepower vs. willpower""...and may the best men win.

If that sounds like a really truncated description of a movie, just keep in mind that 44 MINUTES is essentially the big gun battle in HEAT minus all the character moments, story arcs and, well, the plot. Although each of the good guy characters has a story-arc of sorts, the real character is the battle itself -- what happens when forty cops take on two robbers who are essentially on God mode with infinite ammo. It's about the combination of shock, horror, heroism and improvisation-under-fire that made this street fight one of the most notorious -- and in some ways, glorious -- cops vs. robbers battles in American history. And on that level it delivers. The dialogue is occasionally stilted and TV-moviesh, there is a cheesy moment of redemption for a Latino gangbanger at the end, and the documentary-style cuts occasionally ruin the suspense by letting us know that certain characters live to the end, but as a straightforward action flick, 44 MINUTES works well. Madsen, who has spent almost his entire career trying to struggle out of the dark shadow of Mr. Blonde, is surprisingly likeable as the burnt-out detective who rediscovers his passion for the job under fire, while Ray Baker is quite effective as the seen-it-all training officer who realizes he hasn't quite seen it all yet. Oleg Taktarov, one of the pioneer fighters of the UFC back in its ""human cockfighting"" days, is also unexpectedly good as a Romanian immigrant who is living a perverse, Tony Montana-style version of the American dream.

44 MINUTES is not the greatest movie you'll ever see; it's not even the greatest direct to video movie you'll ever see. But it more than hits the targets it sets for itself, and makes for 103 minutes of adrenaline-pumping action which has the added advantages of being both inspirational and exceeding the (very) modest expectations you probably had for it.",1427328000,2,3535,4.957841483979764

1923420,3,B0000DC3VL,I watched this movie on YouTube. It looked pretty scary. Quite a few times I'd wonder where was Blue Thunder when needed. Two particular characters caught my eye. One was the dog-walking girl wearing a pink tracksuit and a white crop top. She called in after the two maniacs barged into the bank. She was among the several wounded civilians. What kind of dog was she walking? The other was a news reporter who was reporting while the gun battle was in progress. She wore a dark outfit with a natural-colored blazer. Who were the two actresses who played them? I hope someone out there has more information.,1419897600,,606,4.62037037037037

1923485,3,B0000DC3VL,"Since Emil and Larry had apparently already killed a driver from a bank car in cold blood and now faced arrest by the police, they certainly knew they were at least going to jail for life. No doubt about that. So, once they realized they were surrendered by a lot of cop cars, they began to shoot.

I simply didn't understand why the regular officers did not wait, let them go away from the bank, away from civilians, all the while calling SWAT. Only after that, they should have engaged. But, no: seeing all that cars around them with pistols pointing at them, Larry and Emil obviously decided to go all with a bang. And, once the first patrolman was hit, there was no question about this: both of them would never have a proper judgment. (I'm not saying that they deserved one! 'm just voicing my opinion).

Anyway, Larry committed suicide and some soures say that Emil was, on purpose,left to bleed in the asphalt for more than one hour. (I think that was due to the chaos and to ambulances having to help so many wounded innocents, simply there was no resource for him - bad luck).

As a movie, it's clearly intended to glorify LAPD officers, but that's not a sin, because that's what really happened, a lot of officers were decorated. The acting was very good and solid and, for what I've read about the subject, it seems it was a reasonably faithful presentation of the facts.",1192752000,,1382,4.49800796812749

1923489,4,B0000DC3VL,"Watching '44 Minutes' is a strange experience to me. It begins with semi-documentary touch with the grainy images and the actors talking to the camera, but once the bank robbery happens, suddenly the made-for-TV film begins to look like the violent shoot-outs in `Heat.' Lots of bullets fly in the air, making huge holes in the bodies of the cars, and many people are gunned down in the street, police officers and civilians alike. Suppose someone tells you this is made for television, and it would take some time before you believe what is told.

Perhaps before the day February 28, 1997, story of '44 Minutes' would be almost unbelievable. Two robbers armed with AK-47s and covered with body armor go into the bank, and open fire on the outmatched police surrounding the building. The only way for the police officers to fight back is to shoot the head of the criminal, but shooting the moving target is extremely difficult. And as you see, standard 9 mm handgun is not the best choice to do that.

Though Michael Madsen, Ron Livingston and Mario van Peebles all give solid acting, it is the skillful editing and intense gunfights that are the most impressive in the film. The tension of the life-threatening situation is heightened by the good sound effect that conveys the firepower of AK-47s though the use of shaky camera would divide the opinions. Though some (including me) would say the shaky camera brings realism to the film, others would say it is only annoying.

Unfortunately, the characters do not have much time to tell us about themselves. It is understandable that we see no so-called character development as the film is based on the recent events and the real-life people, but the portraits of the LAPD officers here often look like those of the police dramas on TV. The script of Tim Metcalfe gets sometimes flat when it tells of the background story of each character, or Michael Madsen's character who does one thing to keep the loud party-giving neighbors very quiet. It is funny, and I like that scene, but well, is it true? I don't think so.

I don't know anything about the accuracy of the film, but as far as the heroism of the police officers are concerned, the film is a success with one of the intense and realistic shoot-outs I have ever seen recently. But with a less conventional and more detailed approach to the characterization of the brave officers, '44 Minutes' could be much better.",1141084800,13,2423,4.734597156398104
1923499,4,B0000DC3VL,Very good movie about the true story of the worst shootout in the history of Los Angeles.  Very good cast and a lot of action.,1140480000,3,126,4.04
1923500,4,B0000DC3VL,"The whole story was written pretty close to the real incident with intention obviously to glorifying the LAPD, which, in hindsight, should have handled the whole situation much better rather than looked stupid:

1. Instead of containment, should have used some high tech gears to track the the robbers and allow SWAT to take over. This would have saved so many cops and many other citizens.

2. Stupid cop comment on citizens legally buying rifles: ""I cannot believe they just let people buy these.."" A real cop would have known that it is the Second Amendment which allows us to bear firearm. In fact, in 1997, the ""Assault Rifle Ban 1994"" was in place and did not allow any civilian to buy any of those rifles unless the rifles were made before the ban. The cop's job is to enforce the law, not to say how stupid the law is.

3. They keep referring the M16 as a machine gun. It is not, nor is it a ""high powered"" rifle. Many may even feel the M16 is a baby rifle only a little more powerful than a .22. The civilian version is semi-automatic, not a ""machine gun"" which wasn't even available to civilian because of the ban. Another thing is ""armor piercing bullets"" - most ""regular"" rifle rounds can penetrate Level IIIA body armor, the best armor worn by personnel. There's nothing special about the AK47 rounds the bad guys were shooting. Almost anything shot from any rifle is armor piercing unless the recipient is protected by a rifle plate.

4. Obviously written by gun haters, the anti-gun attitude and pro gun control have polluted this movie, but it unintentionally tells people how stupid the gun control is. Criminals don't obey the law but we do. This leaves us with no weapon against criminals firing ""machine guns"" at us. The two perps got their automatic ""machine guns"" (AK47 full auto) with very little effort, while law abiding citizens like you and me were forbidden to have them, not even the semi autos.

Compare this incident with ""Texas Tower Sniper Charles Whitman"" where many citizens pulled out their own rifles, started to shoot back and eventually killed the gunman. Their heroic effort minimized how many people had to die in the hands of the madman, Whitman. It wouldn't happen in CA with their gun laws.

FYI, those who buy firearms from stores are actually the ultimate good guys as they must go through criminal background checks first. Bad guys just buy guns from the black market illegally; they don't give a crap about the law to begin with which is why they are the bad guys.

Again, the movie is not too bad, but with little character building. For those who want to learn a few things, hope my points help you.",1136073600,9,2649,4.611464968152866
1923501,4,B0000DC3VL,"This was an excellent film that did a most decent job of telling the story and showing the ""Heroism"" of the LAPD in handling this situation... I worked for the LASD and knew several LAPD officers who were present... It was handled in the best way possible at the time regardless of what the ""media"" and ""other"" so-called experts stated... It truely is amazing when you read about others ""knowing more"" than the Law Enforcement community that has to handle these situations EVERYDAY... ""Arm-chair Quaterbacking"" what they know nothing about is a favorite passtime these days of  many in the media and ""others""...
This was a GREAT movie and did justice to the retelling of this incident... The LAPD does an EXCELLENT job each and everyday and are all Heroes keeping the city safe for those who'll never understand the sacrifice...",1135036800,2,828,4.872340425531915

1923503,3,B0000DC3VL,"On February 28 th 1997, the LAPD was in a true front of War facing two weak of mind but full loaded weapons guys who decided to steal a bank with heavy arsenal.

The film is told in documental style with interesting flashbacks about the different protagonists involved in this unbelievable fact.

Splendid camera handle though the movie tends to lack intensity at the same level the time runs. So instead a climax wer are before an anticlimax.

Good entertainment but do not search any more beneath it.",1122336000,,502,4.681818181818182
1923504,2,B0000DC3VL,"The tag headline on the DVD box reads ""The most intense shoot out in LAPD history""....unfortunately, the same cannot be said for this weak and slow moving dramatization.

Many persons would be quite familiar with the notorious 1997 incident at the Bank of America branch in Laurel Canyon, Los Angeles when the ""High Incidence"" bandits finally met their match against dozens of LAPD officers in a ferocious gun battle lasting approximately 44 minutes.

This 2003 telemovie is closely based around the events of that day and stars Michael Madsen, Mario van Peebles & Ron Livingston as three police officers caught in the maelstrom of bullets roaring from the bandits gun's. Now, with such gripping source material to work with, three decent male leads and lots of firepower you would anticipate a fast paced, dynamically acted recreation right ?......WRONG !

The disappointing ""44 MINUTES"" never really kick's into high gear and since the character development of the three lead roles is so minimal, viewers don't feel any real affinity for their struggle against the homicidal bandits ( played by ex-Ultimate Fighting Championship contender, Oleg Taktarov plus Andrew Bryniarski...seen as ""Madman"" Kelly in ""Any Given Sunday"" ). Director Yves Simoneau primarily treads down the well worn path (originally started by Sam Peckinpah ) of utilising slow motion cinematography of the incessant gunfire, spent rounds bouncing around on the pavement, grimacing cops & police cars being shredded to pieces. However, the film editing is quite boring, so there is no real zest or excitement whilst bullets are flying in all directions, and the LAPD are trying to halt the carnage. Additionally, any tension build up in the film is regularly dismantled by having the main actors talking to the camera (in character) every 5-10 minutes saying how scared they were that day, or that they didn't think they would survive.

The script writers & director should have decided earlier on whether they were making a testimonial documentary, or an action movie...because it ultimately fails on both fronts.

For my money, if you want to watch more suspenseful, well acted (and action packed) telemovie's based on real life crimes, seek out the gripping ""In The Line Of Fire: The FBI Murders"" starring David Soul & Ronny Cox....or ""In the Line of Fire: Manhunt in the Dakotas"" with Michael Gross & Rod Steiger"".",1096070400,7,2390,5.149484536082475
1923505,4,B0000DC3VL,I love this movie they did such a good job with the weapons and special effects it looks real. The only thing i didn't like about this movie and why it didn't get 5 stars is because i would have liked to see the real footage in the special features section but not every movie is perfect. This is a great movie and is worth the money!,1095465600,6,334,4.0
1923506,4,B0000DC3VL,"First of all I want to thank Vince for serving and protecting....you helped to stop a couple of raving lunatics with Machine Guns and we are very grateful.  Second,  if Vince says its not completely accurate,  so be it.  Frankly though,  even a sub-accurate depiction of the most intense shootout in Los Angeles history is jarring enough.  2 guys with automatic weapons,  body armor,  and using armor piercing bullets.  I mean,  is there anything more terrifying?!?!  I doubt it.

  So again,  thank you Officer Vince,  and check the movie out.  Itll jar you for sure.",1092441600,2,568,4.810526315789474
1923507,4,B0000DC3VL,"I was one of the Detectives involved in this incident...I was there for the entire ""44 Minutes"" firing both a handgun and then a shotgun when I ran out of 9mm ammo.  I found the movie to be off on acuracy but as entertainment it was great.  I must admit the sounds of the automatic weapons fire did bring back memories and get my heart racing a bit.  As to some of the comments by other reviewers about suspect #2 being allowed to ""bleed out"", that was not true.  He died of numerous gunshot wounds shortly after being taken into custody. The LAFD rescue team, who were already busy treating a detective with an AK-47 neck wound and the elderly man who was shot when suspect 2 was stealing his Jeep truck, didn't fill out a R/A slip with the time of death.  A second R/A unit arrived about 20 minutes later and completed a slip using that time as the time of death, which made it appear he laid there over 20 minutes, dying...Additionally, the jury did not come back with a verdit for the family.  The family did not recive an ""out of court"" settlement either.  Suspect #1 did commit suicide at the same moment an officer's round struck him.  FYI-Some little known facts-The majority of ""officer shooters"" were detectives, all were males, and ""old timers"" on the job.  All of the 18 of us out there that day received the Medal of Valor and 10 of us from that group received America's ""TOP COP"" award in Washington DC in October 1998...It one day of many, February 27, 1997, that made me proud to be and LAPD Detective.",1092268800,60,1518,4.392857142857143
1923508,5,B0000DC3VL,"Usually when you hear the phrase ""Made for T.V. movie"" you'd groan. No need to for this picture. This is an amazingly exciting and informative movie on the two men who tried to rob a Bank of America branch located in North Hollywood during 1997. This film shows how the would-be bank robbers took control of the bank with ak47s and how the police brought these thieves down. It even contains real footage of one of the men cimmiting suicide and the other being shot down (this later caused a court case where the man's family sued the LAPD for supposedly letting him die in the street from his wounds).",1091750400,8,602,4.4818181818181815
