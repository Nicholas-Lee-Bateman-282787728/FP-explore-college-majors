2181347,5,B0006B3UE6,"I saw one episode of this on Bravo and was hooked.  However, since they didn't sell it here in the US and my lousy cable system doesn't offer Bravo, I just bought the PAL version in early 2005 - and it was worth every penny.  Of course, not everyone has a PAL DVD player and TV, so that option isn't for everyone, unless you can handle watching it on your computer.  (The PAL version unlike this NTSC one is region-free.)

Regardless, I brought it home, and watched one episode with my wife - not being too sure if she'd like it or not.  Suffice it to say, we were up until 3am watching both DVD's.  I have since lent the discs to three other friends who all had the same ""problem"".  It's hard to stop watching until they get to NYC (sorry for the spoiler, but they do actually make it through alive. :) )

It was merely the closest thing to a ""perfect"" reality TV show I've ever watched.  Highly recommended.",1129766400,8,909,4.238372093023256
2181348,5,B0006B3UE6,"Outstanding DVD.  It inspired a friend to embark on a similar ride and he has been out a over two months so far.

If you can't wait for the USA DVD release in NTSC.  You can order the PAL DVD (from Amazon.co.uk) and play it on your PC.",1129334400,6,235,3.8541666666666665
2181349,5,B0006B3UE6,"Have had the priviledge of seeing this DVD and it's a must see even if you are not a motorcycle fan. Two friends with a dream they made come true. Lots of interesting characters. Air is a bit blue at times, nevertheless a great production",1129248000,6,238,4.311111111111111
2181350,5,B0006B3UE6,This series was so much fun to watch and not only was it entertaining but inspiring - how people can overcome great odds to survive and push forward. Charley and Ewan are to be commended for following through with their dream when most people would have quit.  I highly recommend this series!,1129248000,,292,4.615384615384615
2181351,5,B0006B3UE6,"As a novice motorcycle rider married to a life-long one, I know many of the ups and downs of travelling by motorcycle.  This video shows it all - the joys, the trials, and let-downs.  There are places where Ewan states his misgivings about situations they get into that echo my own when I've been in situations where I felt my skills weren't adequate.  They both summarize it well at the end of the day when the challenges have been met and they are off the bikes until tomorrow.  I doubt if many folks will travel like these two did, but this video serves to inspire people who wish to take a journey of a lifetime on a motorcycle.

Cool video.  I never would have gone that far on a motorcycle!",1129248000,12,696,4.315384615384615

2181367,3,B0006B3UE6,Not been able to watch. My fault for not understanding that PAL in the description meant that the format is European and doesn't work on most US DVD players.

If you remember this is entertainment TV and not reality you can enjoy it.
If you are watching it to see Ewan you will like it.

2181412,4,B0006B3UE6,It was great fun. I enjoyed the preparations.... thats the exciting part! Two friends on a once in a lifetime road trip on motorcycles is great. Where do I sign up? I do agree that we all could have gotten closer to the people and cultures as they travelled through these remote areas. This could have easily been included in the many episodes instead of their family reunions which I wish I had fast forwarded through. The followup is not as fun and doubles up on the home movie family get togethers and even includes Ewen's wife on part of the African ride which changed the whole tone of the trip. Skip that one.,1430006400,,615,4.4035087719298245

With his bank account he could make the time but I'm sure he wouldn't do it without a massive support team and sponsors anyway.

It takes what Mondo Enduro and Tiera Circa lack, and adds the badly needed and well-executed aspect of professional editing and filming.

Same trip, but with no-name, average guys (though, let's be honest, Ewen McGregor is only KIND of known, and his buddy might as well have been introduced simply as ""the annoying friend"").  A third guy (Claudio) rode almost the whole way with these two guys, and he seemed friendlier and more interesting than the others combined, yet he was ignored, overlooked and blamed for just about everything that went wrong.  Not to mention they always had a fall-back plan (and were not afraid to utilized it) by getting help from their entourage of vehicles and men that planned the trip for them, as well as followed along the way.  This was nothing more than a couple of friends who wanted to take a trip, but didn't want to pay for it, and it's evidenced by completely overlooking the culture, native people and landscape that they traveled across.  Another annoying aspect is McGregor's ""anger"" that some local people killed a bear for its coat and organs to sell.  Typical privileged millionaire trying to force his beliefs on others.  Of course, he wasn't too proud to deny himself their kindness in escorting his ass across part of the country in their trucks.  Very disappointing.

The flick has all the makings of a great movie. Adventure, Friendship, (even a hit of love) Scarey and definitely funny.
These two guys are so down to earth and real that you really feel their excitement and fear, you laugh with them and worry for them. They should consider themselves lucky to be such good friends as it's not an easy thing these days.

I'm a motorcycle rider myself and when I heard of this series decided to check it out (a long time after it was released). Well, I'm now a life-long Ewan McGregor fan, not just because of his acting, but because of who he seems to be as a person. His focus on assisting UNICEF is most inspiring. This is a fantastic adventure story of a group of people riding on an incredible journey across the world. The scenery, the people, the challenges, the can-do attitudes of Ewan, Charlie and the support crew all make this an epic story. I can't say enough about how interesting it is, and how inspiring the attitudes of the riders are. They meet challenge after challenge with a can-do, positive attitude that is inspiring. I mostly despise celebrity types and actors, but after watching this series think I'd love to spend many days riding and camping with Ewan McGregor and Charlie Boorman because they're just damn good people.  It will never happen, but should they ever wander across the mountains of northern New Mexico, I'd be pleased to sit by a camp fire with them.",1379289600,,1145,4.558252427184466

It really comes through that this is a trip they wanted to do and they planned it as a TV series to make it possible for them to just ride and have fun, which is wonderful. Both Ewan and Charley are interesting and fun to watch and their interactions is that of old friends. I found myself frequently pausing the series so I could go for a ride myself.

A lot of people who ride, especially people who like touring by motorcycle, have a tough time explaining to other people exactly what it is that drives them to look beyond the dangers of the road. This movie does a wonderful job of capturing all of the reasons, and I think that's why it speaks to many people who don't ride, similar to Che Guevara's book, ""the Motorcycle Diaries."" It shares the challenges and anticipation of planning, the joy of embarking on the adventure, the simple pleasure that comes from seeing new places and cultures and meeting strangers, the struggles on the journey, and the happiness of a homecoming. If you are an adventurer, or if you like tales of adventure, it's a wonderful way to break from reality for a few hours.

It was really funny, intense, and inspiring.  Even my wife who has no interest in motorcycles couldn't wait to watch the next episode.  Amazon lists it's rating as PG but I was surprised at the number of F-bombs throughout the series.

Perhaps they should have done this trip before starting families. Take the wives, if they could have handled it. If you're going to be selfish and plan to leave your families behind for so long, stop complaining about how much you miss them.

But the ""star"" and his (unknown) friend AND their motorcycle-mounted cameraman AND the SUVs following with all manner of back-up gear spoil any concept of ""roughing it"" through the trials of riding around the world on a motorcycle. Yes, they did have to deal with the cross-border corruptions/paperwork entanglements of the third world. Yes, they had their share of motorcycle tip-overs and even an SUV tip-over. But the whining and ""in their face"" amateur camera work gets old in about 10 minutes. In this movie, the ""trials"" of riding around the world are mostly limited to the annoyances of being a ""Hollywood Star"" who wants to ride through town without suffering tendonitis from signing hundreds of autographs in Mongolia and Russia.

It is clear that Ewan and Charley share a great love of motorcycles. The BMW GS1150 Adventure bikes do seem rather fragile at first, but they did see a lot of action on rough terrain.

I was particularly taken by the lives of the people stranded in the more remote parts of Russia by the collapse of the USSR. Their tenacious attempts to live a normal life in the barrens of Siberia was amazing.

2181536,5,B0006B3UE6,"I love this program and recommend it for anyone who has been swept up by the intoxication of travel.  McGregor and Boorman really capture their passion and excitement to experience the countries they pass through.  They don't shy away from showing their frustration or feelings of defeat when the road gets really boggy and hard to ride by motorcycle.  Because their backup vehicles are not really with them, they cannot depend on the vehicles when they get into rough patches.  They have to rise to the occasion and make it work.  They camp out in some of the most spectacular places on earth and always seem to appreciate their surroundings.  The ride in Mongolia is amazing and when they get to the Road of Bones and its rushing rivers things get pretty interesting.

I also love that Ewan McGregor, though famous and wealthy, just seems to relax and let the viewer see his experience in a real and honest way.  There are plenty of egos who would have allowed their fame to color how they come off in the program.  After an episode of the show, you forget who he is and he just becomes another traveler you may meet along the way.  The show becomes about the trip which is why I was watching in the first place.

So few of us can take off three months or have the funds to safely plan such a wild endeavor.  And as a woman who loves to travel (and loves traveling by motorcycle), off-road adventures into the backwoods of Siberia are sadly not an option.  I'm so glad that these guys chose to document their trip so we can experience their travels with them.

Their trip is jam packed with adventures of all kinds from gun toting mafia in Ukraine, raging rivers on the Road of Bones in far east Russia, to bike accidents on the roads of America. It's a test of character, endurance and machine as they cross every terrain imaginable.

There are many reasons to love Long Way Round including the chemistry between Ewan and Charley, seeing heavy duty motorbikes in action or the idea of an epic adventure. I personally enjoyed seeing the project from inception to completion, watching as they pulled together their team, drew up their route and set off on a task they were unsure of completing. There's an innocence to this trip that their later adventures perhaps missed.

Easily the best version of Long Way Down is the Special Edition and is worth the additional cost. The extra footage pads out the show to give it a more complete, less rushed feel.

Good thing I Christmas shop early, because although Amazon *indicated* the ""Long Way Round"" DVD was in stock when ordered, it took over a month to arrive.  Apparently, it was not in stock.

2181543,3,B0006B3UE6,"Long Way 'Round.... paying for stuff.  This show is great, if you like motorcycles and a little adventure.  What you may not like is reflecting on the show's realism, and the sheer expenditure that was made for these wealthy movie stars to do this trip.  Ewan McGreggor, for instance, is going to have a constant multi-million dollar revenue stream for the rest of his life, over Star Wars alone.  Yet, most of what these guys got for this trip was paid for by sponsors, wanting to get their products on TV.  So, the star power exerted on this show allowed these guys to do an unheard of trip around the world, for nothing or almost nothing, out of pocket.  Great advertising space for the sponsors, though, as the BMW adventure bikes have exploded in popularity since the show's release.

Sure, movie stars live a glamorous life, but these guys didn't seem skilled enough to be deserving of a trip like this.  I'm sure that's what added to the entertainment and adventure, but gobs of money were poured into training for the trip that you or I will likely never be able to afford.  Not to say that realism or being deserving of something is ever what we see on TV, but this show tries to make this sort of trip look feasible to the semi-common guys.  It's not.

All in all, it's television, so realism or budgetary considerations can't really be made.  That said, after spending the last 10 years as a skilled motorcyclist, it was kind of difficult to watch this show without some envy for the thousands upon thousands of dollars that were showered upon these guys for this trip, even though they're wealthy movie stars.

Oh, and the show's intro and theme song was really pop-gooshy-sticky.  It should have been Tom Petty's 'Learnin' to Fly', or something a little more motorcycle-worthy.",1252886400,,1790,4.659235668789809

They deal with borders, sleep in strange places, eat strange foods and don't speak the languages. They have help (bribes, staff, fixers, etc.)and 2 follow vehicles that are usually out of camera view.  We watch them navigate country ""roads"" and cuss, crash (tip-over), fix bikes, get stuck, cross rivers, make cameos at UNICEFs and say ""tarmac"" a lot.  In fact they often appear to be amateur motorcyclists.

There's no witty Anthony Bourdain city history and food lessons or insightful Samantha Brown 'places to visit' guidance, but only a few whispered tidbits.

As a bonus, the series shows us the kindness and sharing spirit of many people, their homes and environments. And, if not for the locals' mechanical adeptness and hospitality, Ewan and Charlie and Claudio (3rd biker/cameraman) couldn't have brought back video of these beautiful people and places for us.

It's a standard road trip from Alaska to NYC.

Some can't miss parts are the Russian river crossings in giant, all wheel drive trucks, not hillbilly redneck big but full out Brutalist Communist big and the guy with an AK-47 in one hand and a guitar in another.

2181563,4,B0006B3UE6,"A friend who had recently returned from a cross-country (USA) bike trip loaned me this.  Knowing I enjoy bikes (riding for over 40 years), he thought I might like it.

About 20 minutes into it, I was ready to quit.  The two main characters (Ewan and Charlie) struck me as goofie, inexperienced, self-indulgent ""movie types"".  All the silliness was almost more than I could take.

On top of that, I was amused (and disappointed) to learn of the extent of their travelling support -- they were basically accompanied by an entire crew, including a doctor, in several 4WD vehicles.  Adventure, I wondered?  Yeah, right.

But I stayed with it, almost forcing myself because my friend was so enthusiastic about the film.  And after a while, I began to warm up to it.

Ewan and Charlie are no patsies.  Although they had a full support team, they mostly rode alone (with cameraman Claudio -- an immensely likeable guy -- on a separate bike), with the support vehicles and team well behind them.  Watch these guys repeatedly dig their bikes out of mud and muck in the middle of literally nowhere...watch them sleep in rough and unknown conditions night after night...go with them into strange and a bit frightening situations over and over...see the repeated breakdowns, broken bikes (including frames), accidents, injuries...and see the overall good spirits they maintained through it...well, I think you have to respect them for it all.

It would obviously not have been possible to film this journey without a crew.  Probably it would not be possible to even do it without some support, at least not in four months. So we would not have the benefit of ""going with them"" any other way.  For myself, I very much enjoyed the footage of Mongolia and other obscure parts of the former Soviet Union.  Amazing images that tell so much, I think particularly to those of us with some knowledge of the history of the region (my undergrad degree was in Eastern European history).

I think the most telling thing for me was that by the time it was over, not only did I respect these guys, I actually liked them.  :)  I didn't at the beginning.  But their goofy attitudes, juvenile jokes and silly behavior finally got me laughing with them.  I decided they'd be fun to hang out with.  Or ride with.

Favorite moment: When the wives and kids join them just outside NY is definitely the most touching moment (I think they must have moved the camera away to protect Charlie, the big lug, from footage of himself crying :) ).  But I really appreciated the footage of children in Russia and Mongolia, and I enjoyed the visit to Orange County Choppers, and the guys escorting Charlie and Ewan into NYC.  The whole film was very enjoyable, overall.

I held back on giving it five stars really for one reason: I would love to show this movie to my children (6 and 4), but the fowl language makes it impossible.  Maybe to some it's part of the ""charm"" and ""real life"" aspect of the film, but I can't get beyond the fact that I find it offensive when people use the ""f word"" about every 30 seconds.  Other than that, it's an enjoyable film and I will probably watch it again.",1207440000,,3148,4.623423423423423

2181569,5,B0006B3UE6,"This movie is fantastic!  I am into motorcycling and reading so I checked out the book from my library and read it to find out what the deal was.  I had heard thru the forums that it was decent but that it was really about two rich guys who are handed the best of everything and then whine their way across the world.  NOTHING could be further from the truth!  If you are looking for a Travis Pastrana video, and all the stuff he does, then this video is not for you.  However, if you are looking for discovery and adventure, humans being thrown into situations that are not of the norm for the western civ, then you'll probably love this video.  While I originally started in on this for the motorcycling, I found that the human element was what carried the film.  I watched the first episode, stopped, went and got my wife, we sat down and watched it again.  I knew she would love it as well for the real life of it.  She ended up loving it and wouldn't let me watch the rest of it without her.  She cried in a few places and especially at the end.  (Don't worry no one dies)  I don't do drama shows or drama movies.  I also despise reality shows.  But I am fascinated my real people doing impossible things.  That's where the ""whining"" comes in.  Charlie and Ewan are real people doing incredible things.  Their experiences would tax even the toughest adventurer. They didn't whine so much as, they didn't edit out the painful reactions of their adventure.  And they shared the fun moments as well as the painful ones.  Yes I own it now and I'll own their other two, Dakar and Long Way Down.

Great commentary, incredible footage of these very remote and infrequently shown areas of the world.

Do wish they spent more time in North America. Most of the footage was through Asia (I know it's a big continent), but after they got over to Alaska, they seemed to just skip right over to New York with only a couple stops. More than likely it's because the roads were so much better they could do it in three or four days vs. the multiple weeks to get through Asia.

Still loved this DVD set. I've watched it straight through (in one sitting) 3 times now. Loaned it out to friends who also love it.",1196899200,,777,4.272108843537415

This trip was all captured and sent as a reality tv show, but it's no ordinary tv show. Like Ewan and Charlie said in this tv / documentary, they didn't want to commercialize it, they just wanted to have an adventure and have there be cameras that just happen to be there. It's really funny, it's terribly interesting, it's beautiful, it's frustrating for them, it's perserverance for them. They wanted to visit somewhere they don't understand. And from almost being shot down by some friendly mafia to having a lovely conversation with a lovely old woman with whom they didn't understand in language but converse with through tone and talking with their hands, they got that adventure.

Instead what I saw was nothing but pampered spoiled celebrities who did nothing but whine and complain as to how hard it was for them to slum it in other people's countries and homes.  It made me sick.

Spoiler alert - This DVD wasted way too much time observing preparation of Mr. McGregor, Mr. Boorman, and crew.  It was pathetic when they threw a baby fit that they did not get the motorbikes that they wanted.  It was wrong that they got a free trip, filming, and promotional items, when they can easily pay for it themselves, just because they are actors.  Their egos were way out of line with the Russian consultants.  It was absurd that they paid off the boarder guards and were not arrested for bribing them in the first place!  Charlie accidentally splashed gas into Ewan's eyes.  The producer (I think that was his title.) said that this could be the end of the trip, if not then a serious delay, with no regards to Ewan's safety, wellbeing, or eyesight!  I got so tired of hearing Charlie complaining about the roads and the mud.  He said that if you planted explosives there you still couldn't destroy the road as much as it's destroyed.  He had no compassion for the people who have to live there and actually use the roads on a regular basis....and that was just disk one. I could not stomach it any longer to even watch disk two.

Seeing the trials and tribulations of two movie stars (ok, one star and another actor) was great because it put a personal touch to Ewan and Charley that I doubt many others would have seen if they didn't know them personally.  Watching them work together with Russian truckers to make the Road of Bones passable made them both appear more human as they did the manual labor that few associate with Hollywood actors.

It's real life adventure, and things get fustrating, they get angry at times, and as such, the ""F' word is used.  I'm glad it wasn't ""bleeped out"" as it would have made the entire story very dull.  Some others thought getting a planning committee, a dedicated building for planning and having  support vehicles were all hollywood ""big buck"" creations.  If it wasn't filmed (taped) like it was, the viewer would never have shared in their adventure.  (Those who DV tape their own motorcycle adventures know all too well the effort it takes) They had money to support the trip, so sit back and take the journey with them.  Just don't plan to watch it all at once.  It's a long journey around the world and it takes time.  Try a couple chapters at a sitting.  During the trip, they go on detours to different unique places along the way, and this really breaks up the constant riding of bikes, therefore most adults will enjoy the trip.
My wife and I are both bikers and enjoyed it so much that we waited for our upcomming anniversary to watch the final two chapters.  We just didn't want their adventure to end! We'll watch it again, it's a keeper.

Unfortunately they aren't up to much as guides, so the majority of exotic Kazakhstan, Mongolia and far-Eastern Russia goes past with little comment other than brief uninformative exchanges with the bemused locals and generic tourist comments like ""wow its so amazing..."". With a bit of research they could have added some information to fill out the background, maybe got locals to tell stories, or something. Even the camera work spends a large proportion of the time focussed on the two travellers instead of taking in the scenery.

(One of my bicycles cost twice as much as my old Kawasaki factory road racer!) But watching this adventure reminded me of all the fun that motorcycles used to be when they were all like that Russian motorcycle that they bought for their videographer.

They had a lot harder time of it in Asia because they were riding those behemoths. My guess is that if they'd used the 650 cc BMW's that they originally trained on they would have had a great deal better time of it. Because they were riding inappropriate equipment it made the BMW's look a lot lower quality than they really are. There's horses for courses and they brought a Goldwing to a motocross.

I really liked this series and I don't say that about a whole lot of productions. It really takes me back.",1172275200,,887,4.469135802469136

Like buying a book for a blind person. Nice Christmas gift. Thanks.

While this is a great documentary, and Ewan and Charley are great fun, I was deeply disappointed that this DVD has no closed captions for the deaf (or anyone else who likes captions). If you buy this and you are deaf and/or if you plan to watch it with someone who is deaf, your heart will just sink the floor when, at a time when virtually every major release on DVD has closed captions, you pop in the DVD and can't seem to get the captions to work. You scour the DVD box over and over because you just can't be convinced that the litte squared-off Q symbol for captions is not there. Finally, you come to believe your eyes and what they do not see--no Q, and no captions on the screen. It's like buying a book with all the pages in the middle missing. And yet you paid full price!

I wonder if the new version when it comes out will have captions. I wonder also if deaf people and others who want captions, and full expected that they were included in the price of the first one they bought, will get any kind of refund, or will they have to pay twice for what they thoguht they were getting the first time round?",1168560000,4,1661,4.220125786163522

2181629,4,B0006B3UE6,"Many people dream of round-the-world trips but few are ever able to take them. Be it time or financial constraints, the barriers are often broad and appear unwieldy. So many times we have to experience the rest of the world vicariously via magazine articles or, in this case, a documentary.

LONG WAY ROUND was the brainchild of actor Ewan McGregor (STAR WARS) and his longtime buddy Charley Boorman (ON EDGE), two men with a passion for motorcycling. One day they decide to give this round-the-world idea some wings by mapping out a course across the globe ...but instead of traveling by plane or rail, they decide to do it using two BMW motorbikes.

Preparation for the trip starts months in advance as transportation is arranged, passports collected, boarder crossing ensured, and training of the two riders takes place (CPR, first aid, exercising, motorcycle training, Russian language classes, etc.)

The trip begins in London, England and ends 115 days later in New York. The trip starts out well enough, with adequately paved roads and quaint villages. But the further east McGregor and Boorman travel, the less biker-friendly the way becomes. Smooth asphalt quickly gives way to pitted asphalt, then divot-riddled asphalt, then into dirt roads. Once into Mongolia, anything resembling a sustainable thoroughfare becomes completely blurred by bogs, riverbeds and stretches of absolute nothingness.

Difficulty of traveling aside, the two bikers meet some of the most incredible people. Ewan McGregor being Ewan McGregor, he is initially seen as a hero, a movie-star bringing notice to these otherwise unnoteworthy locales. Police escorts pop-up out of nowhere and guide Ewan and Charley into small townships where parties await them in their honor. But, again, the further east our two journeymen head, the less this happens. In and out of Mongolia, they soon head up into Siberia where they encounter The Road of Bones, a stretch of road built by slave labor during Stalin's tyranny (many a dead slaves body rests somewhere beneath this road ...or so it is said). No one knows who Ewan McGregor is here.

Pushing themselves to the limit, the two slush through wetlands, river crossings and some of the worst roadways in the world. Even a support crew that follows them has great difficulties, one time crashing their vehicle and nearly killing some of the passengers.

Arriving 115 days later in New York, many viewers will breath a sigh of relief for Charley and Ewan. The intensity of the trip is well-spent on the audience, helping the viewer feel the pressure and difficulties of the route. But it also helps us see that what is often said to be impossible is, in fact, possible if you apply yourself hard enough. That and the exposure to the myriad of other cultures makes this documentary a strong film.",1163721600,16,2817,5.0214132762312635

The first couple of episodes are a little slow as Ewan and Charley go through the trials of getting the expedition setup.  What I was impressed with though was the amount of organising, planning AND training they did for the trip.  This wasn't about two guys who got it into their heads they could ride across the world and just set out the next day.  They did off-road bike training, BMW mechanical training, first aid AND survival training.

Once the pair get on the road is when the interesting content of the series shines.  Daily video diary's and their shadow camera man gives us full doses of their every experience.  They stayed and dined with such a broad range of people including mafia with their guns, and Mongolian nomads in their yurts

So many times I know I would have given up and turned back, and on a couple of occasions they almost did.  Bike problems, navigation problems, advice problems, RIVER problems, sometimes it was all a bit too much.  But with a support crew rendezvousing at key spots and their pride to show KTM that it could be done they kept pushing forward through incredible challenges.

I don't want to go to the extent that these two did with their adventuring, but buying a cross tourer and heading for Australia's red centre has become mighty appealing.  Even if you're not into bikes, this series is intensly interesting and well worth a look at a landscape that 99.9999% of the world's population will never see or experience.",1159574400,3,1701,4.552631578947368

Finally got the US copy. FINALLY got to see the segments I missed. I still love the movie myself, but unfortunately can't really watch it with my kids because of the slightly-more-than-occasional use of the F-word. The naked butts are tolerable, but the F-word screws it up for family viewing. Wish I could have bought a censored version. Never really thought much of it when I saw it on TV. I'm still giving it 5-Stars because it still a great story and video. Just not for kids.",1147046400,16,648,4.594827586206897
2181655,5,B0006B3UE6,"Since I decided to pass on the book that sounded like a bad scripted movie trailer - I mean how many problems are you going to encounter with a support crew following you as you ride on brand new BMW motorcycle following a route that you mapped out!

In any case, I purchased the DVD as it would give me a better glimpse of the journey. Sad to say that the first disc is rather boring having to sit and watch Ewan and Charlie overact as they don't get their way with some of the potential sponsors. But just when you're ready to give up on this film disc 2 changes all that!

Germany, Czech-Republic, Slovakia are essentally stepping stones to the Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Mongolia and Russia segments of the film.

I should add that being from Poland myself I understand some Russian, and I found it particularly humorous that Ewan and Charley were totally clueless when trying to communicate or even understand the language. In one scene an older gentlemen asks Ewan to join him for a beer and Ewan and Charley think he wants to cut Ewan's beard (Piwo pronounced pivo means beer in ALL the Slavic countries!)

Aside from the lack of language skills and appreciation of Russian hospitality that Ewan and Charley find suspicious (and frankly most Americans would as well!) the film really has several emotional moments. (The Russian saying that 'having a guest in the house is like having God in the house' is sadly missed by everyone in this film including the filmcrew!).

However, along the route the visit to the UNICEF office in Kiev, Ukraine to see all the children there still affected from the Chernobol disaster from exactly 20 years ago will bring tears to everyone eyes!

From there the film gets better and better as Ewan slowly comes to the realization how shallow an actor's world can be sometimes!

The scenery and river crossings in this film are like you being there - really amazing how these Russian truck drivers think this is just normal driving!!!

All the superlatives that you've read in the other reviews even though they claim 'I loved this film' don't give you a personal insight of how great this movie is, but it is my hope that my review has persuaded you in making a decision to see this film.

I will buy the 10 episode DVD version as well when it becomes available later this year.

How many movies can you say that about?

I know of only three in my life - The Blues Brothers (1980) Breaking Away (1979) and Cinema Paradiso (1989) Italian version",1145404800,8,2476,4.579185520361991

What he and Charlie Boorman set out to do was utterly fantastic. Ewan often pointed out the similarities between more developed countries and the lesser countries. ""Are we any better? No, we're not. We're all different, yet the same. We all love our children, we all need to eat and we all need a place to sleep.""

Charlie and Ewan set out a goal and they made it. They also made me a biker fan. Now I'm taking the course to get my licence!

2181661,3,B0006B3UE6,"I have a love-hate dilemma with this docu made for TV special for several reasons. As a enormous fan of Ewan McGregor, the principle of a trip to experience the world seems a great notion, however, there is more to this story than simply two blokes out for a lark on bikes. This much touted adventure for the extreme sports fans as well featured the star and his best friend, actor Charlie Boorman, on BMW motorcycles on an around the world vacation.

Because of Ewan's star power, the pair are able to offset the cost of this adventure by hiring a television producer and charming companies to donate their equipment and services including two enormous BMW touring cycles, 4x4 SUVs, security equipment, camping equipment, designer duds for biking, tools, toolboxes, and the list goes on and on. They also had a contract with Bravo TV and a book deal in the bag. This is hardly a living off the land excursion, but an expedition that might turn into the ill-fated McGregor- Boorman Party.

Most offensive perhaps, is the statement that the adventure was to raise awareness and monies for UNICEF charities for children, not to profit McGregor and Boorman. Whether this is true is never revealed and if funds were raised for the organization, it's not disclosed, however, the television commercials and internet exposure was worldwide, much to McGregor's surprise. He doesn't seem to understand how expansive power of the web worldwide and is constantly complaining about undo press coverage infringing on their annonimity although much preparation had been undertaken on their behalf to ensure their safety through host countries.

Throughout the two discs set, McGregor and Boorman provide reality TV one-on-one interviews with their personal diaries of the day's activities. It is an informal discussion, usually provided after the pair have settled in for the evening and are about to retire. The humorous quips and obvious friendship and respect between McGregor and Boorman keeps the situation light, but as the conditions of the road deteriorate, so do the spirits of the star.

While Boorman struggles to remain healthy and keep the pair on the road, McGregor is at the mercy of his own off-road inexperience, away from wife, kiddies, and his security blanket, it is his own inability to be of tougher stuff that is exposed. He whines, they both whine, and when it becomes almost intolerable, they meet situations and people who live so far below their upper middle class standard and pampered lifestyle it becomes obscene to complain without their seeming hypocritical.

Although invited to share the food and homes of numerous kind folks along the way including Mongolian nomad herders, and other working class individuals, the experience of seeing the world as they've never known it is still trying for Ewan.  It is only when the pair is exposed to the remains of the soviet block countries is there the beginning of any reality check for the pair. Children dying of radiation exposure from Chernobyl, abandoned street urchins living under the streets to survive the cold, and nomadic herders are so foreign to McGregor he is at times embarressingly childish and unprepared for the reality of such hard lives.

Only when the pair reach the United States, Alaska, through Canada, and into the northern states to NYC do the pair seem to relax among English speaking, cell-phone toting, westerners like themselves. But, it is during the hardship of the Road of Bones that McGregor seemed to finally grow up and with that experience under his belt, his entry to New York is a decided letdown.

I enjoy the two personalities, but the premise of how the other half lives has an uncomfortable aura of such western privilege in the face of poverty that it makes for uncomfortable watching through most of the series.  Language is the least offensive of this documentary, the four letter words are actually refreshing.  It was the sense that into the world rides the prince of BMW-land, with kit, mate Charley, and camera crew in tow.  Just keep on truck'n, sir Ewan.",1142121600,15,4068,4.9676470588235295

It is what it is... and engaging tale about the adventures of two friends who decided to make a long-lived dream actually happen.  Forget that they are two celebrities, (yes, Charlie Boorman is a successful actor too) and just enjoy watching the chemistry between two real friends, the challenges,  the beautiful landscapes, the people they meet along the way... and the bikes!

This series draws you in because they direct a lot of their dialogue to the camera, so you are right there with them through the laughs, the border delays, the mechanical problems, the exhaustion, and the dreaded `Ball-Soup'!

The extended 10-episode DVD is basically the same, with more footage about the trip preparations and the prep-crew, and more of the US portion of the journey which US audiences may find interesting.  The visit to Orange County Choppers has also been extended.  However, having seen both, I would say that the original 7-episode DVD is still my personal favourite.

We both ride Harley's and I also indulge in Dirtbikes, but nothing over 650cc's.  I really like noticing the gradual differences in the physical characteristics of the people they meet along the way, as they travel ever further east.  Their sense of humor is sometimes self-depricating but always hillarious.  I can't help but wonder if things wouldn't have gone smoother with smaller bikes though?

The DVD is an excellent value in human nature, not to mention human geography, and we both highly recommend it to anyone.

2181674,4,B0006B3UE6,"There is lots to love about the story of Ewan McGregor and Charlie Boorman's amazing trip around the world on their BMW motorcycles. The trials and hardships that made the journey so memorable are well depicted, and the honesty with which they allowed their own fears and disappointments to be shown, along with the joys and delights of such a trip, make this a sort of everyman's adventure story. The two come across as likeable sort of chaps, sometimes in a bit over their heads, but with the fortitude to keep going even when the going was incredibly hard. In that sense, the story is beneficial as a sort inspiration to the rest of us to persevere when things get difficult.  The scenery, especially in Khazakstan, Mongolia, and the Russian Far East, is spectacular. It definitely instills a bit of the old wanderlust in the viewer. The fact that the trip as used to benefit and showcase the work of UNICEF (one of the United Nations few actual successes)is appreciated as well. About the only complaint that I had was the more or less constant use of unnecessarily crude language. It added nothing to the story, and instead provided an irritating and disappointing distraction.  Both these fellows obviously have the intelligence and ability to use alternate vocabularies.  Sadly, they chose not to. Otherwise, I loved the series, and have watched it several times.

From the planning of the trip and the training and negotiations with the sponsors to the funny report between Charlie and Ewan this show is a can't miss. Also you get great motorcycle footage and you get to see and learn a lot about different cultures and countries that they travel thru. And believe me this is not a liesurely ride on the tarmack the boys time and again wonder if they are in over their heads when they reach Mongolia and up into Russia/Siberia. They go from making 400 to 500 miles a day to 25 miles a day the roads and terrain get so bad. There are even times when pushed to the breaking point the boys are almost ready to break down emotionally from missing their loved ones and from shear exhaustion.

Ewan and Charley go around the world and not only discover new lands and people, they discover life and the effect that motorbikes can have on you during a journey. This version that just came out, is the full version I watched on Bravo. So if there is more to come in 2006 like the other reviewers are saying, than that will be an even bigger treat.

  If you're motorcyclist this is the documentary for you. Me and my best friend Matt watch this show all the time. Over and over. We watch and we get into the spirit so much, that we go an ride on our motorbikes. This show makes you dream and dream big. It gives you the excitment to go and get on your bike and enjoy what the world has to offer.

 Charley Boorman and Ewan McGregor have truly made a cult classic motorcycle documentary. This will be passed down to generations of motorcyclists and dreams will become reality.

 ""However, riding a bike isn't just about going flat-out fast. It's also about taking your time, steadily eating up the miles, cruising the highways, letting the road take you whereever its going and not worrying about the destination, just enjoying the journey."" ---Ewan McGregor---

 Truly one of my favorite quotes from the book Charley and Ewan put out(Long Way Round). When you ride, live by it like I do. Motorcycling has changed for me because of this documentary. When I ride my bike, it is......well...you'll just have to ride for yourself. Motorcyclists, you won't be disapointed.

What a wonderful opportunity to show first hand the beauty of other cultures--their people, their traditions, and their architecture. What a wonderful opportunity to show our children the incredible extent of the humanitarian hand of Unicef--all of these things, using the attention grabbing excitement of an extended journey on motorcycles--this DVD had all the potential to be an unforgettable and amazingly fulfilling educational experience for my children, if it were not for the constant uneccessary use of vulgar language, jokes, and nudity.  The American release of this DVD would not qualify as anything less than an ""R"" rating.  This, given the amazing opportunity to enrich and teach the little minds in our home, is a great disappointment to me. Were the few laughs they may have gained from the adult audience worth the loss of impact this DVD might have had on a young generation in developing their opinions of the vast world and the peoples and organizations in it?  Next time guys, be a little less self-serving.  Feel the reach of the journey in the larger sense.",1135728000,12,1189,4.984848484848484
2181698,4,B0006B3UE6,"This is the two-CD, 7-episode version.

The UK version is PAL-encoded with no region restrictions. PAL means it probably won't play in your normal DVD player.

There is an option if you want NTSC encoding and Region 1: buy it from canada. Amazon's .ca store has the 10-episode version, and the price is very reasonable (though about double this, once you pay for shipping).",1135641600,8,373,4.8125

2181700,4,B0006B3UE6,"Quite a fun cataloged romp through the vast hinterlands as two mates (and a cameraman) take off on loaded down BMW scoots from England and scamper across continents to end up in NYC...this series does a good job of cataloging the trials and tribulations of the journey, including broken frames, torn muscels, and having a camera prodding your ever wakings...it also did a bang up job on the preperation needed for this kind of an undertaking...it however falls a bit short in the department of expansive scenary shots, and focuses a bit much on the lads, not the journey in total...the same could be said of asking for a reduction in the amount of perilous feat documentation by the sag wagons chasing the lads...

in the vid, it was said that the lads had nearly 800 hours of content captured, for which they reduced it all down to 8 shows made for the low brow TV audience (sold to Bravo in the States) which needs conflict as a modus operandi for how content must be displayed...would gladly pay to see the unedited portions of the on-road content (minus the interviews)...

in the end, one comes away with higher regards for Charley Boorman, his riding skills, his civility and good nature towards the populace, if not his respect for the landscape which in some cases are first glimpes of terrain only known by the natives...

in all, a well done journey, and something to be watched by anyone with interest of long travels...high regards gents from the REVerend Jimenez...",1135555200,,1478,4.72093023255814

2181702,5,B0006B3UE6,"This review is only based on the first three episodes so it might change.  I'm loving it.  I would strongly suggest you read the book first.  Why?  I think it lets you get to know the places and people first, allowing you to really watch the video and absorb the visuals that much more when you ""see"" it.  You can ""look around"" with them while they ride . . . and really see the fear and concern on their faces when they get into sketchy situations.  The part in the massage/bath was hilarious - something you'd see in an Austin Powers movie.

I'm really looking forward to the rest of it.

Thanks again to those two.  Unlike some people, I think the motivation to record it was to share the experience, not get a bunch of free stuff.  That's retarded - it's not like those two couldn't afford to fund the expedition themselves anyway.

With all the pro's I have, I will share just one possible con . . . I'm hoping they have a little more about the US in the series than they did in the book.  There's a lot to see here, granted we are a young country with very little history, but the landscape is as old as it is in other countries, and quite stunning.

Good luck to the both of you for any future endeavors.",1134950400,,1211,4.190476190476191
2181703,5,B0006B3UE6,"Ewan McGregor and Charlie Boorman ride motorcycles from London to New York the ""Long Way Round:"" east across the European and Asian continents, crossing into Alaska, through Canada and on to New York.  The trip is most adventurous across the Asian continent when Ewan and Charlie enter Kazakhstan, and continue along treacherous routes through Mongolia and eastern Russia.  As a consequence, five episodes of this seven-episode version are dedicated to the toughest part of this journey--leaving Alaska, Canada and the United States to be covered in the final chapter.  That's Ok however, as Ewan and Charlie treat us to extraordinary views of country and people seldom seen by Westerners.

Kazakhstan is a bit humorous as the pair is greeted with local police escorts and just about every town official along the route.  Mongolia is fascinating as the duo encounter people living in the most barren places of the world.  The route gets very tough in areas and will satisfy adventurers' and motorcyclists' appetites for challenging situations as Ewan and Charlie negotiate rivers, bogs and very rough roads on their heavily-laden motorcycles.  The route becomes almost impossible in far eastern Russia when they ride the final leg to Magadan on the ""Road of Bones;"" a road manually constructed by prisoners.  Interrupted by rivers swollen from winter run-off, the team resorts to assistance from hardy Russian truckers who travel the route--sort of a reality ""Wages of Fear (1955 movie).""

Motorcyclists will enjoy this show as Ewan and Charlie each ride an R 1150 GS Adventure, BMW's famous large displacement dual-sport motorcycle.  It's an interesting study to watch their preparations for the trip and the numerous problems--mechanical and environmental--they solve to get to New York.  A fascinating event is their original choice to ride KTMs, which falls through after that company feels they'll be unsuccessful.  BMW steps up to sponsor Ewan and Charlie, and leaves an interesting debate for brand fans to ponder how KTMs would have fared on this trip.  BMW proves their quality as the bikes motor-on under excessive loads, extreme temperatures, deep water and numerous tumbles.  I'm a KTM fan, but have to concede admiration for BMW and their decision to support McGregor and Boorman on such an arduous trek.",1134864000,10,2317,5.227027027027027
2181704,5,B0006B3UE6,"I just got my copy of the Long Way Round Special Edition here in Canada and it is the 10 episodes version.

2181705,5,B0006B3UE6,"I've had the UK version of this DVD for a year now and it still delights. In case you didn't catch the entire truncated series on Bravo, highlights include the visit to the spa, traversing the road of bones and some details on how they prepared.

Ewan McGregor had never name much of an impression before this, but his humanistic decency and sense of humor shine through here. Even through his darker moments, he's never too far from joking the Scots built this or that around the world. Charley Boorman is his rock and is the real jokester between the two.

On the question of whether to buy this version or wait out for the special edition...I think the regular version is adequate to satiate viewers who caught an episode or two and are curious to see more. For viewers who caught all six of the US episodes and were hooked, the added value of the special edition may be worth waiting for.

What's missing from the reg version is even greater coverage of the preparation (two full hours now), which includes lessons on how to run from shooters; sad attempts to learn CPR and an extended expletive retort from Charley after KTM doesn't sign on. We never really got an pre-trip info from Bravo, so at least the regular edition has one episode of that. Also missing from the reg edition are interviews with Charley and Ewan's wives, a trip to Harley Davidson headquarters and 2005 interview with the boys, two camera men and the producers reflecting on the trip.",1134259200,,1462,4.593869731800766

Keep in mind though that this is the 7 disc (7 episode) version.

The 10 disc version is becoming available to the UK on Dec 6th and of course the US will get it ""at a later date"".

I figure since I've waited this long a bit longer won't hurt if it means getting the full version. I'm guessing it will contain more of the US part of their Journey but also has a lot more extra footage.  I purchased the video ""Faster"" when it first came out and now after I already own it I find that it was a ""Demo"" version with single disk, and now the version offered is a 2 disk full version with lots of extras.  bummer. now I'll have two copies eventually.",1132704000,9,749,3.966666666666667

I had to watch it twice as the DVD gives a sense on excitment, dispare, friendship and childishness these two shared with a small team of cameramen and support vehicles. You can't describe the drama they went thorough on the ""Road of Bones"" in east Russia...can't beleive they made it. I'm still ticked at KTM motorcycles for pulling the plug on sponsoring the ride because they ""didn't think they would make it"". Kudos to BMW for believing in the dream!

2181709,4,B0006B3UE6,"I love this show and highly recommend it to pretty much everyone who has the travelling bug.  I would have given it 5 stars based on the merits of the show alone...EXCEPT saying that this is ""uncut"" is misleading.  In fact, the DVD producers will be ""double-dipping"" later in 2006.

It is important to note that they released a longer special edition of this show on DVD in the UK last week.  So now there are actually 10 extended episodes of this show that are available as a three disc set everywhere else in the world except North America at this point in time.

The region one disc being released in North America in December 2005 only has 7 episodes (on two discs).  They are planning to release this 10 episode version later in 2006.

If this doesn't faze you, and you need to get this NOW then I still think you'll enjoy the heck out of the 7 episode version.

However, if you can hold out for the 10 episode version (or buy the PAL version from Amazon UK), then I'd strongly advise you to do that instead.
