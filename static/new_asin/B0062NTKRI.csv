4933123,1,B0062NTKRI,"This is the worst flow yoga I have ever seen, don't waste your money!  It doesn't even ""flow"" unless you call a snails pace a flow.  The instructor has the most annoying and aggravating voice, its like she is talking to an audience of 2 year olds.  Horrible waste of money and time.",1363996800,4,282,4.283018867924528
4933124,5,B0062NTKRI,Great Yoga video. I wish there were more deep breathing in between exercises. But thats my own personal preference. Overall a great DVD.,1362009600,,136,4.956521739130435
4933125,5,B0062NTKRI,"My wife was looking for some additional yoga DVDs to mix up her workout. This series is amazing for providing a challenging total body workout. The background is beautiful, the woman is very good at leading and perfect at all positions. I would highly recommend to anyone looking to advance their workout and take it to the next level. Most of these workouts will leave you shaking from exhaustion.",1355097600,6,398,4.782608695652174
4933126,5,B0062NTKRI,"The instruction on this is great and easy to follow.

Nicely paced flow yoga with 6 workouts which range from 25 to 45 minutes long.  Plus there is also a 10 minute warm up and a 20 minute cool down which work well for either yoga or for whatever else you are doing.

Lots of yoga to work with, and if you are looking for flow yoga, this is one of the videos to check out.",1354320000,3,372,3.8684210526315788
4933127,3,B0062NTKRI,The workout is well done. Nice flow and routines. I do grow weary of yoga instructors wearing tops that make both me and my young sons uncomfortable when they walk in the room. I would greatly appreciate instructors' bodies being covered up a little more so nothing's falling out in various poses. Just looking for a workout - not a peep show.,1346198400,6,343,4.548387096774194
4933128,5,B0062NTKRI,"She is a great teacher who presents material that is good to develop your yoga practice with a range of flowing workouts.  There is a general selection of 8 workouts (which includes a nice warm-up and a cool-down workout to use with other exercises) that range from 20 minutes to 40 minutes or so.  It is easy to find something to do a few times a week.

There is also additional workouts (more than the 8 mentioned) where the general workouts are combined with warm-up and/or cool-down for the days that you have more time and just want to do longer routines.  They also flow smoothly since the segments are long.

Highly recommended for people who want to add more strength/flow workouts to yoga.",1342483200,10,698,4.596774193548387
4933129,5,B0062NTKRI,"Very nice yoga DVD that contains a different yoga practice than your average yoga DVD.  This DVD has a nice, simply flow that is just right (not too difficult, not too easy).  And, love the outdoor scenery; is very relaxing.",1329609600,5,224,4.575
4933130,5,B0062NTKRI,"This is a great set of general flowing yoga routines that stretch you out and help get stronger which is nice to also add to whatever workouts you do.

It has 8 routines, a Warm Up (10 minutes), General Flow (25 minutes), Arms (40 Minutes), Back Bends (35 minutes), Legs (40 Minutes), Core Strength (45 Minutes), Hips (45 Minutes) and Cool Down (20 Minutes)

I use the Warm Up and Cool Downs also with other workouts.  There are also extra versions where the Warm Up and/or Cool Down are added to the main segments if you want a longer routine and it flows really well also, with a small couple of seconds transition that takes you from one to the other that keeps the workouts moving.  (All the main sections run the times above.)

She is a good instructor and makes the workouts easy to follow.",1328918400,16,796,4.424657534246576
4933131,5,B0062NTKRI,"I was searching for a new yoga routine after getting annoyed with many of the free options available with ExerciseTV (and not to mention that ExerciseTV is about to disappear forever in a couple of weeks). Many of the instructors huffed and puffed their way through routines and were hard to follow. So, in my desperation to find new yoga routines, I stumbled upon this. Now, let me preface my below comments by saying that A) I typically like bouncy and more intense workouts, and B) I was originally skeptical of doing yoga and have had a difficult time finding instructors and routines that I like.

What I Like: Monica doesn't huff instructions out as she goes through the routines - she instructs through a voice over; her voice is calm and pleasant; the routine options come with the option to do solo, with a warm up, with a cool down, or with a warm up and cool down (extra nice for when you may want to do 2 routines in a row); the background music is pleasant (i.e. no annoying flutes)

What I Don't Like: there doesn't seem to be a many alternatives to positions offered (i.e. more novice versus advanced moves with certain positions); the transitions between warm up and cool down with the routines - I know it saved time when filming but I feel like I lose some of the flow when these transitions occur. It definitely wouldn't have been enough to deter me from purchasing this DVD however.",1324339200,22,1402,4.537549407114624
4933132,5,B0062NTKRI,"This video is a great collection of flowing yoga workouts, including some general flow and ones that work legs or core a bit more.  I really like the Warm Up and Cool Downs if I am going to do some other exercise and want to do some yoga and that there are also options to include them with one of the other routines.",1324080000,3,317,4.031746031746032
4933153,2,B0062NTKRI,"Music too soft, too much voice.  Very beginner level.  Was looking for more flow like: (body flow, Les Mills).  Would be good if you had a back injury or wanted something slow and easy going.",1452643200,,191,4.4
4933154,5,B0062NTKRI,"I have bought this before and will be buying again very soon! (lost my last one -.- )
I see a lot of people saying the narrator's voice wasn't the best... I personally really enjoyed it. If you would like to sample the dvd, there is a video on youtube showing the arms routine including the warm up and cool down.

Also, saw some people saying the flow is too slow. If you're a beginner this is perfect. I used to do yoga all the time as a child, and wanted to pick it back up. This dvd was the perfect way to use the knowledge and skill (which wasn't much, mind you) I already had to really get back into yoga.  You still work, still feel the flow, but you have the time to get comfortable, really feel the pose, know your body in the pose, etc, with this pace.
I love how you can choose to do just a warm up, just a cool down, or both. You can do a warm up with a routine and no cool down, vise versa, or have both with the routine. So basically the dvd is completely customizable. There's routines focusing on specific body parts, as well as whole body.

LOVE LOVE LOVE this dvd PLEASE if you're on the fence, just look it up on youtube! It's titled ""From BodyWisdom's Flow Yoga Strength and Flexibility Routine - Warm-up, Arms and Cool Down"" That way, you can see the warm up and cool down, as well as a routine!",1449014400,5,1316,4.093023255813954
4933155,4,B0062NTKRI,"Pretty fast paced in my opinion, but she's smokin so it's ok.",1442448000,,61,4.166666666666667
4933156,5,B0062NTKRI,Great workout.,1438732800,,14,6.5
4933157,5,B0062NTKRI,"There is a nice Warm-Up of 10 Minutes and Cool Down of 20 minutes, plus 6 other workouts between 25-45 minutes which all flow nicely.  You can also use the Warm-ups and Cool Down (either one or both) with the other 6 by selecting from the menu.  The Warm-Up and Cool-Down have also been good for other things I do.  Teacher is very good and easy to follow.",1438041600,,356,4.205882352941177
4933158,5,B0062NTKRI,Very much like the Les Mills BodyFlow that I am used to.,1430352000,,56,3.75
4933159,5,B0062NTKRI,Great format and well organized.  Really like how she tells you when to breathe (even if it's a little slower breathing that I can do).  Challenging workout without being impossible.,1428969600,,182,5.033333333333333
4933160,3,B0062NTKRI,Easy enough to follow along for a beginner/intermediate person like myself.  Not my favorite video.,1426550400,,99,5.6
4933161,3,B0062NTKRI,"I will begin by saying I have not viewed the entire DVD but definitely enough to provide input.
I must agree that, for me, the narration is not ideal - her narration feels unnatural to me during most of the sections.  It feels as if she is trying to project a relaxed tone or feel to the narration during much of it - but it comes off as awkward or unnatural to me...often it feels rather ""sing-song-y"" rather than feeling relaxing, steady or calming.  Her narration during the cool-down section was much better overall than the other sections I practiced.  I agree with another reviewer in that the manner in which ""inhale"" and ""exhale"" prompts were delivered did not appeal to me. Additionally, sometimes the narration and instructions were quite complete and reasonably clear whereas other times it seemed incomplete and a little rushed - as if missing a step - for instance, coming out the of poses seemed cut short at times...(interestingly, there were other times I felt the pacing/narration a little too drawn out for my preference).  There are aspects of this narration that grate on me some...Narration styles vary and this one is okay, but there are others that are much better In my experience/preference.
I would say the ""routines"" do seem to provide reasonably good balance in what they offer with good variety and a good workout.  If you are looking for more flexibility/floor poses, this may not be for you.  They are included, but the routines seem to emphasize more flow routines and strength.  I would definitely Not recommend this DVD for Beginners...this DVD is best for intermediate or above.  From what I have viewed and practiced, the instructions do not generally provide adequate suggestions and guidance to modify for beginners or someone with injuries or physical restrictions.
As far as the function or flexibility of the multiple routine offerings on this DVD are concerned, it is not quite as flexible as some, it seems a tad limited though no DVDs seem to have the perfect answer to the multiple sections format I suppose.  I have some others I prefer and seem to flow better from one section to another - I like the format of Zyrka Landwijt DVDs - in fact I recommend her DVDs in general...she is excellent.  Love Sarah Powers also.
Hopefully this may help someone in deciding about this DVD.  We all have different needs and preferences in what we may be looking for with a yoga DVD.  Definitely a lot of reviewers love this one, but for me it would only be for occasional use.",1425340800,5,2510,4.744827586206896

4933163,4,B0062NTKRI,"Seemingly good practices, the ones I've done are good.  She does unfortunately have a really terrible voice:/ If you could get caught up on that you may think twice.  There are the 8 routines as it mentions.",1421884800,,207,4.5675675675675675
4933164,5,B0062NTKRI,Monica is a master instructor. The video is beautiful and inspirational. I've been doing yoga for over 25 years. I wholeheartedly recommend this beautiful pause for focused health.,1421712000,,180,5.464285714285714
4933165,5,B0062NTKRI,"I LOVE this Yoga DVD. I was looking for something challenging with variety that I could still be able to do on my own. This DVD is perfect as it provides a variety of targeted workouts (arms, legs, core, hips, etc) ranging from 25 to 50 minutes then you can add either a warm-up or cool-down (or both!) to each targeted workout.  I would not say this is for beginners, as it does not include many modifications if you can't hold the pose or separate instructions on new or different poses, but it is perfect for those who have practiced Yoga in the past and are looking for something unique and challenging. I have used other DVDs from Bodywisdom media and this DVD just solidifies that they will be my go-to-choice when I have to buy new Yoga or Pilates DVDs in the future.",1421107200,2,774,4.375
4933166,5,B0062NTKRI,Great dvd!  I have only had it for a number of weeks now and am alternate between the bodywisdom collection and Tara Styles yoga dvd collection.  I am an intermediate level yogi.  This dvd it's definitely a challenge that well make you sweat.,1417651200,,242,4.5813953488372094
4933167,5,B0062NTKRI,"Excellent yoga DVD.  Good warm up and cool down routines.  I like the different options to work on core, hips, legs, etc.  I found her voice to be very soothing.  I don't understand how people find her voice annoying.  This is yoga, not a dance class.  Maybe they should be watching Richard Simmons or Susan Powter.",1414800000,3,315,4.535714285714286

4933169,5,B0062NTKRI,"I love this dvd! It has become one of my favorites. I would recommend it to someone that is familiar with yoga, the poses are not difficult but your strength and flexibility will be tested. It is a full body work out and you will be feeling it the next day. I would recommend to do it everyday and do not skip a day you will see results.",1399420800,5,337,3.9705882352941178
4933170,4,B0062NTKRI,"The model easily performs all of the postures.  There are many chapters with warmups and cool down segments, and you have a lot to pick from depending on what you want to work on, or how much time you have to get a yoga session.  The outdoor background scenery is beautiful but not distracting.  The voice over pronunciation can be irritating when told to ""aaxx hale"" after ""inhale"" over and over.  Some of the postures are really challenging but none require super human powers and balance - I would recommend this to anyone who wants a lot of variety and professionally done presentation.  If you can't hold all the postures at first you can challenge yourself to keep doing them until you can.",1397692800,,696,4.626016260162602
4933171,3,B0062NTKRI,"I really wanted to like this yoga DVD but I just could not get past how annoying the instructors voice is.  Throughout the entire routine she continually says ""Inhale"", ""Exhale"" in a very annoying way.  Others may not be bothered by the voice and the overall DVD was good but for me her voice just ruined being able to focus and relax during the routine.",1393200000,3,354,4.430769230769231
4933172,5,B0062NTKRI,The routines are well paced to give plenty of time to the quality of the pose.  You will feel the burn!,1390867200,,103,3.9047619047619047
4933183,5,B0062NTKRI,"This is by far my favorite yoga DVD for the very thorough but concise instruction, continuous cues on alignment, the way I can customize my practice and for the way I feel after. This is a great one to do between classes in the studio. My favorite is the general flow with warm-up and cool-down, but I also love the legs and hips sections. It's just a perfect format and Monica is a great instructor. Also, it's in a beautiful, serene setting that seems to envelop me every time. Great quality - wish she would make more DVDs!",1389398400,2,526,4.377551020408164
4933184,5,B0062NTKRI,This is my favorite yoga video I have tried. I like all of the different varieties and choices of length. I would highly recommend this video. I have done yoga for several years and still use this video. I think they are good workouts.,1389398400,,235,4.363636363636363
4933185,5,B0062NTKRI,This dvd kicks my butt! Definitely the more challenging intermediate level I was looking for. I like all of the options for different routines.,1388275200,2,143,5.0

4933187,4,B0062NTKRI,This is a good workout that is more about the exercise than hokey spirituality.  Moves at a good pace and has nice flow.,1375401600,,120,4.217391304347826
4933188,5,B0062NTKRI,"I love this tape because it offers many levels and is well explained.  From the beginner to the advanced, it will keep my attetion for years to come.",1374969600,,149,4.321428571428571

4933190,5,B0062NTKRI,"First of all, any guys reading this review - Monica Gonzalo is freaking fine! Super nice body! Very enjoyable to watch.  : )

4933191,1,B0062NTKRI,"oh my god, I just put this DVD in and had to take it out only after 10 min. The instructors voice is so annoying. I wished somebody would have warned me. Yoga suppose to be relaxing and soothing and not like this. The exercises were good (as much as I could see) but the sound of the instructions... horrible. Total waste of money",1371686400,4,330,4.171875
4933192,5,B0062NTKRI,"This DVD offers several yoga routines for different areas of body focus, always with the option of either / and / or warm up and cool down. I would call myself ""intermediate""; these practices are all challenging. My sister and I were laughing and falling on the floor because the ""abs"" routine was much harder than anticipated. I wouldn't do this DVD on an ""easy"" day.....",1366156800,,372,4.651515151515151
8491302,4,B0062NTKRI,"This is an excellent yoga DVD, probably one of my best and I have over 100. A beginner might feel that its a bit tough but a person who practices regularly will like it. That being said, however, the narration can really get on your nerves. The instructor tries to speak (I guess) in a soft, soothing tone and draws out her vowelsiiiiiiiinnnhale, aaaaaaaxxxxhale (yeah, it sounds like she is saying axhale). After a while it wears really thin which is too bad because its a nice workout. She also says foe-ward instead of forward which isn't bad in itself, but combined with the exaggerated vowel-holding, it gets to you. But the workout is good, not aerobic, but good.",1523318400,,669,4.630252100840337
8491303,4,B0062NTKRI,"I'm really impressed with this dvd. It does give you a lot of options in terms of time and areas you want to specifically target. I did have a technical issue with the menu. I do have an older dvd player and the menu is very complex letting you customize the workout. While reviewing the dvd, and trying to get back to the menu. It would tend to freeze and not let me use my remote to choose a selection. i had to remove the disc to get it back on track. This isn't something i would do, i would just choose a program or segment and wouldn't go back in the middle so it really won't impact my use of the DVD.  The narration is helpful, but i can see how an advanced yogini would be annoyed by it. I find it helpful, Im not a true beginner but mostly do fusion workouts.",1515456000,,769,3.9935064935064934

8491305,5,B0062NTKRI,I'm a beginner and this DVD is perfect. I enjoy the instructors voice and her concise instructions before each step. I'm new to yoga and very encouraged by the flexibility and range of motion I have felt after completing just the warmup. Definitely worth the money. I enjoy the scenery as well because it enhances the feeling of well-being while performing each pose.,1478649600,,367,4.841269841269841

If you're short on time you can do 'just' the warm-up and cool-down or the warm-up, general flow and stop there if you're short on time. If you have more time, you add the cool-down. If you want to focus on one area each day, this DVD lets you do it.
Beautiful scenery, Monica's direction is on point and calmly given, not distracting, and you just feel so good when you're done.
I have lots of exercise DVDs, lots of yoga DVDs and sets, but this one - Number one. I'll be surprised if I use anything else for a while.",1470009600,3,567,4.163636363636364
