8317876,5,B001LEZ4JQ,"Becci Crowe's respect and passion for the wildlife and people of Africa is evident throughout ""As Close As You Dare - Africa."" Her gentle nature, curiosity and warmth invite the viewer to become a participant rather than simply an observer of her adventure. Not only are you treated to spectacular scenery and incredible interaction between Ms. Crowe, her experienced guide and the wildlife of Africa but you are also given the opportunity to watch Becci Crowe, an accomplished wildlife artist, capture the souls of her subjects while sketching them up close and personal in the African bush. ""As Close As You Dare - Africa"" provides a marvelous trip down memory lane for anyone who has ever been on safari and the incentive to make the reservations for anyone who dreams of going on one. I loved this DVD!  L. Casentini  Saratoga, CA",1227052800,2,834,4.866197183098592

As Close As You Dare provided me with an opportunity to see Africa through the eyes of an artist who is able to capture the essence of her subjects beyond a snapshot in time. It's a very intimate experience that showcases African wildlife and people without a hint of exploitation. The scenes are spectacular and the action is real and sometimes unpredictable.  Definitely worth adding to your video library if you appreciate viewing wildlife in their natural setting.,1226966400,,539,5.056179775280899
