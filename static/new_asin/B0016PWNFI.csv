8263931,3,B0016PWNFI,"I enjoyed this show when it was on in the early 90's. And it was still funny
after all these years later. However for a ""Best of"" I was annoyed to find that
all of the episodes are from season two only. The show was on for five seasons.
If your a fan of the show, get the season sets. I'd give it a five star rating
if not for the misleading title. Good likable cast with little morality plays
for plots and then something crazy funny happens to put a smile on your face.",1302652800,10,471,3.968421052631579
