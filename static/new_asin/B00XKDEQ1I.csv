8716145,4,B00XKDEQ1I,"This is a barre workout with the emphasis working on your abs, I did the entire workout this morning which is 60 minutes workout and I really feel my abs been worked. The instructor is pretty pleasant except the heat cueing was off just a little bit and that is the reason a gave 4 stars instead of 5 there was one instant where you are facing the wall and you are working you thighs with your knew up working you abs at the same time and she did not mention when to change the legs so I end up overworking one side but it was just a short period of time so I will pay more attention next time. I have been wanting to changed my abs for a long time and nothing seems to be working, my abs are petty flat but I would like muscle definition and I am hoping this dvd will help me with it. I am doing kettle bell 3 times per week and I am planning to use this dvd at least 2 time per week",1440547200,2,884,3.8360655737704916
