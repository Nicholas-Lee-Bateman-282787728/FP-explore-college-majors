3133322,3,B0014J5LN2,This product was not what I was expecting at all. I was not pleased with it. It was moreso an instructinal video with a short KB workout. It looked like a home video. So I was not happy after I watched it all the way through.,1306022400,2,225,3.9130434782608696
3133323,5,B0014J5LN2,"I'd say my perspective is that of a kettlebell beginner. I began using kettlebells less than 4 months ago. Prior to that, I'd never even heard of KBs and my exercise routine consisted primarily of lifting a TV remote control and pushing a computer mouse around. I've never been an ""athlete"", and I have a bad shoulder. I am also not many years younger than Steve Maxwell's age of 54.

However, I am very glad that I took the chance on this DVD set. The first DVD gives very good instructions individually on each of the 18 exercises, with warnings about typical kinds of improper forms as well as some variations if the standard form is to difficult. This in itself is good beginner information. The second DVD is the actual workout, where you follow along with Steve as best you can for the 26 minutes of the routine. By the end of it, Steve is covered in sweat and even says with a smile ""I know I won't be working out tomorrow....I'll be recovering!""

So, this workout is very hard, very intense. But all along the way, Steve points out that it is a *goal* to keep up with him; it is not a requirement. (Indeed, if you could already keep up with him the first time you did the routine then you probably have less of a need to buy this DVD.) Instead, he provides tips about how to rest if the reps become too much, how to use your other arm to steady the KB while you do the reverse lunges, etc. He also repeatedly recommends using a lighter KB because by the end of the workout even a light KB will feel heavy, and to pause and rest if your form starts to break down.

The point is that he *encourages* you to keep up, but he does so in a very positive way. He doesn't hide that he struggles a bit at some moments in the routine, that he pauses momentarily for an extra breath here and there. Because it is very hard. But this I actually find helpful because instead of it being intimidating, you feel like there is some camaraderie as you are struggling side-by-side with him.

The videos themselves are unapologetically simple (Spartan?) in their production, It looks like the same set location as in Steve's Encyclopedia of Joint Mobility DVD set (which I purchased at the same time). But the lighting is fine, the audio quality is good, and there is mercifully no background music.  Likewise, Steve's presentation is unpretentious and down-to-earth; he is personable and informative.

If you are a beginner and have the mindset of realistic expectations for yourself and that doing the full routine at his pace is a goal, and you are willing to work your way up by (for example) doing 1 rep for every 2 of his at times, or pausing the DVD on occasion to catch your breath, then I recommend this DVD set very much. I'd imagine its a must-have for intermediates, and advanced folks probably would use it for variety...or to find out just how advanced they really are. :)",1265500800,35,2875,4.4356060606060606

3133326,4,B0014J5LN2,"This is a follow along -type exercise program using one kettlebell. The workout develops strength endurance, cardiovascular conditioning, flexibility, and just about every aspect of conditioning, except for maximum strength. The kettlebell should be relatively light, you can do 12-15 military presses with performed in a strict fashion. But don't worry, by the end of the workout it does not feel that light after all. The instructor tells that the workout is inspired by the movie ""300"", but it's not related to the exercise program the actors used in preparing for the movie.

The film consists of two parts, one being instructional section where every exercise used in the workout is instructed in detail, and the second part is the actual follow along workout. The instructions are very detailed in the sense that the instructor gives the viewer some good tips on exercise performance, but the exercises are not broken down to parts so that a beginner would learn the moves. But then, this workout is not intended for beginners in the first place.

The workout consists of 18 exercises done back to back fashion, with no rest periods during the workout. Each of the exercises is done for 5 or 10 repetitions total or per side, so that the total number of reps done in the workout is exactly 300. The instructor tells that this is the perfect number of repetitions in a workout, but in my opinion it's the perfect number only from marketing standpoint. The workout would be as good if it consisted of 290 or 310 total reps. I don't think it would ruin the workout if you adjusted the rep ranges slightly to suit your fitness level, if you don't have a suitable weight.

The actual workout is follow along -type workout. In my opinion, this is too challenging workout to be used as a follow along workout fashion. Rather, I think it's better to work out on your own pace rather than to try to keep up with the instructor on the film. Therefore, I found it a bit annoying that in the instruction section the instructor does not mention the target number of reps on many of the exercises. You have to look through the workout to see the rep ranges before you can use the workout yourself.

I think that the workout is suitable for trainers of intermediate level and up. There are some technically demanding exercises, but for the most part the workout is just too hard for beginners.

The production of the film is quite basic, but everything works just fine. My only complaint is that the mat the instructor is standing on squeaks a little as he moves around. This is a little annoying, but still a minor issue. The reason I don't give this film full 5 stars is that the price is a bit high, compared to many other similar films.",1231372800,36,2731,4.634297520661157

8255835,5,B0014J5LN2,good stuff. But the soft swing style is different to the russian hard swing style. I prefer the russian swing style,1420934400,,115,4.523809523809524
8255836,5,B0014J5LN2,"I first discovered Steve Maxwell from the Joe Rogan Podcast and researched him and his methods of training. I finally decided to give a try to one of his workout DVDs and I was not upset. It is a great DVD for any beginners discovering the Kettlebell.

It is 2 DVDs. the first DVD covers all the exercises you do in the workout regimen. He gives you step by step instructions on how to do the exercises properly and that is import to me considering that a lot of people have no good form whats so ever. The second DVD is the actual exercise regimen. You go through the exercises with Steve Maxwell (54 yrs old in DVD) and get into a great workout sweat and it is tough to keep up with this man! I recommend this DVD to anyone and everyone! It is a great, short and intense workout, which is another reason why I like this DVD. Depending how much weight and how fast you move, this workout can take as long as 45 minutes. But those 45 minutes or less are really intense and will definitely push you to your limit.

If I have any complaint, it is that he does not have a warm up section. He jumps right into the kettlebell exercises. Would have been nice if he had some stretching or some jumping jacks or some form of exercises to warm up AND cool down the body but then again, it's just a kettlebell challenge.

Aside from that, this DVD is great. I highly recommend this to anyone and everyone!!",1412380800,5,1396,4.2209737827715355

8255839,4,B0014J5LN2,I got this for my son for Christmas.  He's interested in working out and recently bought a kettlebell so this DVD was a bit hit for him.,1357084800,2,136,4.037037037037037
8255840,5,B0014J5LN2,My son requested this specific dvd to go along with some kettlebells he had purchased.  He is in the airforce and likes to be able to do some exercises in his room.  He was very pleased to receive this dvd as a gift.,1356739200,,216,4.0
8255841,5,B0014J5LN2,This is an excellent video. I use it 3 times a week and have been for a year. I have tried many others from Dragon Door and this is by far the best. His Joint mobility DVD is great too.,1353110400,2,185,3.65

8255843,5,B0014J5LN2,"Personally I have long grown weary of the same old weight routines at the gym, let alone paying for a gym membership. We all know we are supposed to change our routines every few months or so, but most of us do not.  I was bored and I started looking into kettlebells. Wow, it's incredible the workouts you can get with one kettlebell.  A kettlebell will cost about a month's worth of gym membership but it my book it is totally worth it because you can do a killer workout right from home.  (Gyms obviously don't want you to know that otherwise nobody would join.)

You can find plenty of YouTube videos about kettlebells but few actually show you how to use them properly. I really like Steve Maxwell's videos and I have a new sense of energy and look forward to my workouts instead of feeling bored out of my mind.  If you have been going to the gym for a while I think you will find kettlebellls a great way to exercise your entire body and really get your core involved not to mention your endurance. The workouts can be very intense and short in time, but you will definetly want to rest the next day. I can get my workouts done at home in the time it took me to drive back and forth to the gym.  Keep up the good work Steve!",1306281600,5,1231,4.194915254237288
