This new edition is said to have restored the original theme song music and has some nice extras. I always liked this series! Good stuff and Adams is very likable.

UPDATE: AUGUST 20

Just got my copy and did a quick scan, as mentioned in the product description, each episode starts off with the theme song, only the first few lines, however in the end credits, the FULL Version of the song is sung. The show's theme song, ""The Rebel"" alias ""The Ballad of Johnny Yuma"", was composed by Richard Markowitz, with lyrics by Andrew J. Fenady. Members of the Western Writers of America chose it as one of the Top 100 Western songs of all time.

7166816,4,B00X99RMUU,"I must confess to having mixed feelings regarding this release. While I am pleased with the opportunity to finally have this entire series available to view at my leisure, I must admit that the quality is not what I had hoped it would be. The Rebel was an interesting premise and a well made western series with Nick Adams handling the Johnny Yuma role much more proficiently than the producers apparently felt he could. The two year run was less than the series deserved. Even the best westerns of the era usually included some very lightweight episodes overloaded with comedy relief that rendered them ""silly"" on occasion. While that observation varies among viewers, I would think that only one or possibly two episodes of The Rebel fall into that category. The changing locales allowed for guest appearances to replace the need for a regular cast and the ever-changing faces served this series well. I also applaud the bonus disc with the pilot episode of The Yank starring James Drury and the various interviews included. Having said all that regarding the positives this package offers, the overall video quality is disappointing. Yes, the original Johnny Cash theme song is present for us to enjoy but the 16mm sources utilized have a number of issues. There are varying degrees of shaky video, blurring, video artifacts (as they call video flaws), and a few small dropouts. Also, on my set, many of the episodes feature black bars on each side of the screen rather than full screen presentation. This is not on only a few episodes as nearly the entire second season is that way as well as a substantial amount of season one. While I did not count the number of episodes involved, I'm sure it is over 50% of the series. The series is certainly still solidly viewable and, if indeed these were the best prints available I would understand and hold my peace. That is not the case though as I have seen reruns shown (sans the Johnny Cash theme song) which are much nicer and actually own a bootleg version of the complete series that has many episodes of finer quality than available here. It is STILL a nice set to have but I do believe it could have and should have been better.",1505347200,4,2184,4.675324675324675

7166834,5,B00X99RMUU,"'BUYERS BEWARE' - Originally I had bought this from what I thought to be a reputable seller.  After loading the discs I noted the quality just didn't seem right and have a trained eye to discern compression artifacts from heavily compressed video.  I loaded the disc and sure enough it showed 4.2gigabyte as the DVD size which indicated a ""single layer-disc"".  I went to the Shout Factory web page and found an FAQ on counterfeits and bootlegs.  Sure enough their site provided invaluable tips on how to discern the difference.  They noted bootleggers have gotten so good to also include the sticker on the shrink wrap.  I notified the seller and also ordered from ""Sold and Ship by Amazon"" so I knew a true original was on the way as they buy direct avoiding possible counterfeits.  You get what you pay for.  We have two DVD players on our PC and I was able to load both the counterfeit and the original side by side.  Take a look at the attached image.  Visually looking at the two box sets outside and inside there's no way to tell if you only had one box set.  They appear to be spot on direct copies.  This included image clearly shows the proof needed, note the greenish cover on the right which is the counterfeit.  Please check whatever you buy to be sure you get what you are paying for.  Outside of all this, with the original discs displaying on a 78"" TV, they look great.  Highly recommended for Rebel / Nick Adams fans",1473292800,51,1432,4.453846153846154
7166835,3,B00X99RMUU,"It's great to have the Johnny Cash theme song restored. The concept - a former Confederate soldier roams the West - is a good one, but as a series the Rebel is only middling, with mediocre stories and acting. The best thing about it is its brevity, each episode coming in at about 25 minutes (typical for a 30-minute time slot in those days). As a result the shows tend to not be as tedious as some of the longer Westerns from that period, such as Maverick and Cheyenne, which were usually well-padded with filler in order to reach the 50-minute mark.",1472774400,,551,4.411764705882353

I give this box set one star for the terrible quality of the picture and sound. This should not be since the series is currently airing on the H & I network.viewing this show over the air, every episode is in pristine condition. The show was obviously remastered. This box set looks like something scanned from a 50 year old 16mm print.you see scratches and aberrations throughout  the episodes, you can even see where the film had a round punched out hole in the upper corner to alert the projectionist of a commercial break. Washed out and grainy , hiss on the sound track. Shame on TMG/Shout for distributing such a poor quality item when there is a remastered set out there.",1452297600,20,784,4.52112676056338

I just wanted a better copy than what YouTube has to offer. Don't waste your money on this because it is official, the unofficial you can actually watch. The first disc of season two had 3 episodes can not be watched. I can't wait to see how many other episodes on the second disc of season two can not be watched. The company that made this must not have reviewed it before release. I expect that when I pay a high dollar for something that is actually free on the internet that it would be at least as good if not better than what is free.

Maybe now someone might release the wonderful Loner starring Lloyd Bridges, Trackdown with Bob Culp. I know this line has become such a clich&eacute; but honestly they really don't make shows like this today as Im too young to have even seen them first time around and I am now an avid collector of loads of these old shows having binned depressing modern day stuff.

7166899,5,B00X99RMUU,"Being a baby-boomer, I still think back with great nostalgia to the films and tv shows I loved in the late 1950s and early '60s, and the actors who appeared in them.  One of my favorites was the late Nick Adams, and there can be no doubt that The Rebel was his signature role.  After the recent release of two other great westerns, The Dakotas and Lawman, it is nice to have The Rebel join them.
The basic plot is simple: the Rebel, Johnny Yuma, rides throughout the west after the war and writes about his experiences in a journal that he has been keeping.  Adams is great and this Sunday night staple was one of my favorite westerns.
Yet it only lasted two years, despite being, according to the show's creator and Producer Andrew J. Fenady, the highest rated show on Sunday nights.  In a very long interview as part of the special features, Fenady explains that it was network politics and the creation of a brother series ""The Yank"" that wound up doing ""The Rebel"" in.  The interview with Fenady is long and you will learn much about this classic series (although I must admit to getting a little annoyed with Fenady constantly re-lighting his cigar throughout the interview.)  By the way, the pilot and only episode of ""The Yank"" is also part of the special features of this set.  Interesting to see another western starring James Drury, about a year or two before ""The Virginian.""  Fenady is asked point blank whether he thought that Adams committed suicide, he says no.  (I saw an interview with Robert Conrad some years ago where Conrad, who claimed to be Adams' best friend, said that no way did Adams commit suicide.  Another Hollywood mystery.)
There is also an interview with Adams' children, Allyson and Jeb, who speak glowingly about their father.  (The interviewer had the class to not ask them about their father's controversial demise.)  Throughout the interview, watch Jeb's continued annoyance as his sister constantly cuts him off while speaking.  There are also some terrific clips of Adams doing commercials for The Rebel's two sponsors: Cheer detergent and L&M cigarettes.  (I still get the biggest kick out of those old commercials with people telling us how good cigarettes are for us.)
I've watched the first two episodes and the quality is adequate.  The pilot episode is excellent with Bonanza's Dan Blocker playing the vicious villain of the show.  (According to Fenady, the week after this episode was filmed, Blocker shot the pilot for Bonanza, and the rest is tv history.)  Strother Martin also appears in the pilot.  (The episode of ""The Yank"" is fine also with Drury and John McIntyre.)
As others have stated, all of the episodes have the classic theme sung by Johnny Cash.
The Rebel was a classic series that should have lasted longer.  However, tv series had longer seasons in those days, many going up to 39 episodes, so the average series that lasted two seasons would have a similar amount of episodes to a  series lasting three or four years today.
I highly recommend this set for this great western, the special features alone are worth getting it for.  It is nice to have the great Nick Adams as Johnny Yuma back with us again.",1442361600,17,3169,4.725454545454546
7166900,5,B00X99RMUU,"Watching the shows in this set is like going back in time, I haven't watched them all yet but this is the way i remember watching them with the original theme music.  I refuse to watch the repackaged ones on T.V. in fact I have just about given up on watching television.  The good shows are almost gone.

7166904,5,B00X99RMUU,"The company that put this out was supposed to have been SHOUT who usually had good quality DVDs.  Allyson Adams, his daughter, said it was SHOUT but now the reviews name a different company. I just ordered it as it was initially noted as being near $80 and now $40 for the complete series. I worked as Nick Adams secretary in 1958 before the TV show. He had completed ""NO TIME FOR SERGEANTS"" and was going to film ""SING, BOY SING,"" with Tommy Sands. I had left Hollywood for awhile and when I went back Nick learned I was there and invited me to visit filming on the set at Paramount. Robert Conrad had moved to Hollywood from Chicago and Nick was trying to get work for him. Knowing Nick and working for him was the high light of my early years in Hollywood. I hope when my DVD comes this week that it will look good. I tried to get the Rebel Company to put it out years ago. They said the masters were in a warehouse and too hard to get it together. Maybe a Blu Ray edition will improve it. It really could
have been restored. If all the James Bond movies were restored like new, a TV series can be too. I would like to see it colorized.
