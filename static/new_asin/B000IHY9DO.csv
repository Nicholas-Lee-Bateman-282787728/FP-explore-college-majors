It was funny at times, part thriller at other times, and even a little romantic. There were some plot twists and unexpected events but it was worth watching. We don't see much of the two stars these days. Connie married John Tesh and Ed did very few shows or movies after this, although according to IMDB he is still active in the business. Maybe it was the ""girl talk"" at the beginning that I didn't follow too well. I would recommend the movie.",1523491200,,597,4.292035398230088
