8047780,5,B0007KQR6O,I'm betting the second reviewer didn't like the Knight's Tale either.  We dvr'd this on SCIFI and I was hoping I could find this on North American DVD.  Hopefully they will release it.  It was a fun ride.,1156636800,,204,4.315789473684211
8047781,5,B0007KQR6O,"I will admit, this movie has a few weaknesses, but those should not stand in the way of the strengths.

""George and the Dragon,"" which also appeared on the Sci-Fi channel under the title ""Dragon Sword,"" REALLY reminded me of the dragon stories I used to read and watch when I was a kid and young adult.  However, it's told in a way that appeals to adults as well.  It follows the quest of George (James Purefoy), a knight who just returned from the Crusades. George is the ideal crusade knight: battle savvy, honorable, and loyal.  After visiting his family, George's father sends him on a quest to find the dragon that George's father tangled with years before.  George, who believes dragons are extinct and his father was just telling a fairy tale, finds his own quest.  The king's daughter, Princess Lunna (Piper Parabo), has gone missing, and her father offers George a fortune to help find her. Despite the opportunity for wealth and fortune, George only wants an acre of land, two cows, and rest from over fifteen years spent fighting overseas. Meanwhile, the princess finds a quest of her own - to protect a dragon's egg.

The most important thing to realize is that this is very much about the characters instead of the dragons.  It's about the struggles of the characters and the way they handle those struggles.  It's also about honor and friendship.  The movie does have an amazing cast, and I'm not talking about the ""big names"" here like Val Kilmer and Patrick Swayze.  I'll admit, this definitely did not represent their best acting - at all.  I'm talking about an amazing cast, like James Purefoy and Piper Parabo, who are able to pull off their roles despite the weaknesses of the movie.  These characters have a wonderful on-screen relationship as they banter back and forth, and James Purefoy excels in this role.  It's not hard to see why he got the part as the Black Prince of Wales in ""A Knight's Tale.""  In fact, if you liked him in that role, definitely catch him in this movie (which was released three years after ""A Knight's Tale"").

Be warned, however: the beginning of this movie gets off to a bit of a slow start.  In fact, the beginning almost seems like a cross between ""Dragonheart"" and ""Monty Python"" thanks to the skateboarding monk and a few other . . . moments.  Some of the fight scenes were lacking, but others were actually impressive.  Despite the slow start and some of the low-budget fighting sequences, the film is completely worth it.  It takes off and manages to stand out as an awesome fantasy movie that comes from a genre notorious for ridiculous content.

This was a great popcorn movie.  It told an entertaining and touching tale of courage, friendship, and honor (despite some of the occasional . . . goofy moments).  Overlook those and the rest of the movie has a lot to offer!  It is a great movie that the entire family can enjoy.",1156636800,2,2884,4.620825147347741
8047782,1,B0007KQR6O,"George and the Dragon was quite a disappointment, considering the makeup of the cast: Patrick Swayze, Michael Clarke Duncan, and Val Kilmer among others.

There are no words to describe how AWFUL (!!!) this ""movie"" was from beginning to end, but let me try anyway so as to give people a fair chance to avoid it and thus try and prevent their day/evening from being ruined: the film deals with the return of an English Crusader, who decides to visit the king and ask him for an acre of land to live off.  During their meeting, the king informs him of his missing daughter and the former crusader takes it upon himself to find her.  Little does anyone know that the princess does not really wish to be found and that she is guarding something rather unusual...

It seems as though the actors/directors/producers went to the countryside on vacation separately, while there they met up with each other at the hotel lounge over hot chocolate, and then decided, on the spot, to make the best of their stay by doing a quick, impromptu, and easy film on the side for some extra cash/spending money.  The word ""amateur"" in describing their work has to be the understatement of the year!

The major setback is in relation to the acting (or lack of it).  The acting-oh my- the acting is beyond words...  School plays (and pre-school for that matter) have better acting!  It is truly sad...  The big names are unrecognizable!  It's as if they're just fooling around or are under the influence of illegal substances.

Another weakness is in relation to the very poor dialogues and the weak plot/storyline for which the writers and director are to blame.

To mention just a few of these ""beauties"":

1) A medieval priest making his escape from the gallows on a skateboard...

2) George the Crusader, relieving himself on the beach and then pulling up his zipper, which includes the sound of an actual zipper...  I did not know how advanced people were in the Middle Ages...

3) George's elderly father (who by the way does not have legs) riding a straw horse into battle!

4) Tarik, the Moor, repeatedly snapping his fingers on people's foreheads as a joke...

5) Patrick Swayze's and Michael Clarke Duncan's heavy American accents in the midst of Medieval England...

6) PATHETIC special effects AND battle sequences!  (One has to see it to believe it)

7) S L O W moving plot, characterized by unabated B O R E D O M...

The only positive aspects of the ""movie"" are the setting/location (with the scenery being beautiful!), and the costumes, which are pretty good (though nothing great).

So it's a weak plot, a great setting and a wonderful cast, which when put together fail miserably.

The potential for a great movie was definitely there.

In short, it could have been so much better if the actors had actually acted, and the writers/director had the ability to... write and direct!  A shame really...

Rent or buy at your own risk.  You have been warned!",1136332800,6,2947,4.678988326848249
