8736694,4,B016LFJHJM,"I spent a year doing networking and research around Chicago before starting ""ChicagoTalks.org"" citizen and community news website when I was teaching at Columbia College Chicago. I met Chris Drew at the Uptown Multi-Cultural Art Center (UM-CAC) first, but he was at anti-war protests, the hearing when the FCC came to Chicago. Anywhere there was an opportunity to talk about free speech and the artist's right to express their speech through art, Chris was there with his silk-screen patches. This documentary shows Chris getting arrested for selling art patches in downtown Chicago, but then getting charged for recording his own arrest. It details the fight in Illinois against an unlawful eavesdropping act, and along the way, it shows the diverse community of citizens and activists in Chicago, from Native Americans to the Occupy people. You will learn about Chris Drew, but you'll learn more about the ongoing struggle to preserve the right to engage in public, political dissent. The music is original, the video is authentic.",1446076800,4,1033,5.228915662650603
8736695,5,B016LFJHJM,I've seen the movie 3 times It is an excellent documentary film that deals with one man's struggle to overcome the injustices of the Illinois eavesdropping law the right to sell one's art out in public and Chris Drew's personal battle with cancer. Nancy does a wonderful job of pulling all these issues together and making a very thought-provoking film,1444953600,4,352,4.883333333333334
