2410706,3,B000BBOUAO,Tony needs to be the center of attention too much.  It's always got to be about him first.  He comes off as a ticking time bomb in this HBO movie.  I believe the abuse happened.  I am sickened by it.  I don't know how anyone lives with him without being pulled into his vortex of anger and madness.  The movie disturbs because of Tony's off-centeredness as well as the Church's coverup.  I hope Tony finds inner peace beyond all of this. The ripple effect of abuse is what the film wants to impress most upon the viewer.,1141948800,2,520,4.298969072164948
2410707,5,B000BBOUAO,"As an adolescent, Tony Comes of Toledo, Ohio, was molested by a Roman Catholic priest.  Tony is now a fireman, with a wife and 2 children, one of whom is soon to take First Communion.  Through a cruel Twist of Fate, they discover that the Dream Home into which they have recently moved  is only 5 doors down from Tony's former abuser - the unrepentant former priest, shown in his video deposition
Q:  Why did you decide to go into the seminary?
A: I decided that it would be a good life if I was a priest.
Good for whom?
Church Ladies will not approve of Tony's ""firehall"" language - but then, they probably won't be watching. The scandal of serial abusive priests should be enough to P off the Pope.  But one of the saddest things is, it's not.  Too many priests and parishioners are in denial.  This unflinching HBO documentary is not about the shameful statistics but the horrific and traumatic toll on actual lives of an abused altar boy and the ""ripple effect."" /TundraVision, Amazon Reviewer",1141344000,38,997,4.5363128491620115

2410732,4,B000BBOUAO,"Im very torn on how i want to rate this. Firstly, the director is the same guy who did ""the hunting ground"" which was great until i learned that its full of inaccurate stats. Secondly, i think exposing religious corruption is very important and its important to put a face to the victims. However, when it comes to the catholic church, i think the focus should be on how massively widespread the problem is. ""Deliver us from evil"" here on amazon would be my best suggestion for this topic. Now, all that being said, the negative reviews of this are ridiculous. Two one star reviews because it wasn't the toni braxton movie?! Thats quite unfair. Another one star because the topic is ""disgusting""? Foolish. Another low rating because someone didn't think the man shouldve turned away from god after his abuse? Get effed with that nonsense! So im going to rate this a little higher than it deserves to counteract some of the dumb reviews.",1467590400,,936,4.678787878787879
2410733,4,B000BBOUAO,"This documentary was well done and the subject matter treated with the seriousness and consideration it deserves. My heart broke for Tony and his children, his wife and mother, not so much. I found his wife to be almost completely devoid of compassion and utterly selfish. Same with his mother. They placed religion and the Catholic Church above their husband and son. If that had been my husband, I would have left any religious institution that had allowed/perpetuated the abuse of my spouse and never looked back. Nor would I have allowed my child to become a part of that same institution. She acts like he's crazy to not want to go to church or support (financially/emotionally) the very institution that enabled his abuse! Now THAT'S crazy! And his mother, good grief - no wonder he never told her what was going on! She is heartless and selfish, as well! If it was a choice between my son's mental health and a church, you better believe I would choose my son!!! I was so frustrated watching the lack of compassion from his mother and wife - as well as the additional stress they were causing this man who was/is clearly suffering. I actually was hoping they'd gotten divorced so Tony could find someone who treated him with true compassion and put his mental health above her need for Communion, for crying out loud. Ugh.

2410751,4,B000BBOUAO,"This is a very disturbing movie and not easy to watch because it is so infuriating that the Catholic church gets away with covering up their crimes and perpetuating them by simply sending the offenders to new pastures where they can continue raping children.

The movie tells the heartbreaking story of firefighter Tony Comes, who has all of his life had to live through the trauma of the aftermath of sexual abuse. In his story you can see that the abuse does not only affect the victim, but his whole family who all have to suffer. That should be an indication of the enormity of the crime that the ""religious"" watchdogs of the church have suppressed and covered up for years and years, probably ages. Sadly, it ends up with Tony accepting a payoff from the church (of course it's an admission of guilt) but not the proper and formal apology that he wanted. Hopefully, he and his wife will be able to put this behind them and get on with their lives.

The most troubling part of the film is the interview with serial rapist Dennis Gray, who denies to the bitter end that he has done anything wrong and even claims that putting a penis in a child's mouth is not harmful at all to the child. It dawns on you after a while that this is what true evil looks like,this utterly, utterly soulless man who has no compassion or empathy for the children who are put into his trust.

The way the Catholic Church dealt with the sex abuse scandals is a dark stain on their sleeve, a stain that will remain there for a long, long time. After all, it's not about just talking the godly talk, but walking the godly walk, right?",1410739200,3,1613,4.406040268456376

But it's amazing and sad, and especially disgusting, when you hear that the Church actually has something such as Cannon Law. Really..? What about the VICTIMS? It's like taking the lambs and feeding them to the lions. I've always had reservations about the Vatican and such how lavish, all the gold, but really the stock portfolio of that ONE parish?.. My God.. And like some reviews or comments.. I do not think God had this in mind when he wanted people to come together to Praise Him. In today's society, Catholic Churches are nearly empty, Catholic schools are closing due to low enrollment. And why? Cause of cover ups like this...what comes around goes around.

2410769,3,B000BBOUAO,"What unfolded before my eyes was the story of a man who decided to go public about a wrong that was done to him.  What is seen insults the sense of decency, appropriateness,  justice: the instance of authority doing in the dark what it would not dare do in the light.

History is replete with examples of parents leaving their children exposed to the elements because unwilling to attempt their care.  They have put their children in the service of others, they have apprenticed them, they have put them out to  foster care or day care.  They have trusted public and private institutions with their education.  Our children can be all they can be in the military, even covertly.

The church hasn't responded by saying, for example, to make an omelet on must break eggs.  They follow the policy of containing the damage.  Certainly, just continuing to assign likely young priests who seem to have a vocation for it to youth responsibilities seems unwise.

Perhaps credibility will not be tested in these areas of dubious service as they once were.  Within the flock of true believers are some whose faith suffices to enable their murder of abortionists.

2410777,5,B000BBOUAO,"Kirby Dick (This Film is not yet Rated) brings us a moving documentary about clerical child rape. Tony Comes and his family are the film's focal point. A 34-year-old firefighter, he is introduced to us at a local primary school in Toledo, Ohio, explaining monsters and firemen (an oxygen mask would scare most children into frozen terror). Cut to a deposition of Dennis Grey, the priest who groomed, raped and terrorized at least half a dozen boys in his cottage alone.

The film alternates between the monologues of Tony and his wife Wendy. Wendy was attracted to Tony because of his outgoing and frank nature (Wendy was the polar opposite). Tragically, she converted to Catholicism as an adult, being unaware of the repeated instances of rape her husband went through.

The bishop in charge of Tony's diocese claimed that Tony was the only victim, but this was swiftly disproven. The lies, deceit and betrayal is made worse by Tony's own mother, his own flesh and blood, whose maternal love and devotion was torn asunder by the church (she continued to give money each Sunday to the very organization that raped her son).

One of the most moving moments of the film are the inaugural annual meeting with SNAP (Survivors Network of those abused by Priests), where child rape victims, now adults, share their experiences of inexcusable and unforgivable breaches of trust. Another is an informal get-together Tony organizes with two othe victims of child rape at the tentacles, mouth, tongue, fingers and genitals of Dennis. The confession that Tony pours forth toward his fellow abuse victims. At 14, Tony was older than most victims, and felt he could have done something to throw a wrench into Dennis' schemes of further abuse.

The film ends with a note of tragedy and hope. While Tony received a pittance from the Roman Catholic Church, he and Wendy are still married, despite having seen attorneys to arrange a divorce. I was left wondering whether the Comes are still Catholic (needless to say, I hope they have cut all ties with that wretchedly banal and pernicious institution).",1355184000,,2086,4.917613636363637
2410778,5,B000BBOUAO,"Over twenty young boys who attended a Catholic high school were sexually abused, and the horrifying events that took place came to light over the years. However, in today's world with pending court cases going on throughout the world for cases involving sex abuse, these shocking cases are not only a disgrace to any particular religion, but to society itself. The Traumatic and Emotional scars left behind in each victim can never be forgotten, regardless of how long it takes for justice to be served. As a health-care provider for over 30 years, I've taken care of victims in different situations. May I add, it is the most heart-wrenching circumstances to work under, one very sad, and the victims do Not recover overnight. It is a Nightmare for any victim, sexually-abused in any situation. It takes years of therapy to heal the terrifying scars for a crime throughout the world that must be under extreme strict laws within the justice system.

Jason Berry's book ""Render Unto Rome"" tells the startling financial losses of the Vatican and especially the U.S. Catholic churches who pay for most of the suits(closing in on $2 bilion).  This money is nothing compared to the agony and suffering of these victims. Tony Comes is a reluctant victim at first, but the abuse from 20 years earlier forces him to act.  Valiantly, he fights along with others to seek justice.  His wife supports him which gives him strength to carry on under duress.  I especially underscore the scene where he tells his 10 year old daughter about his experiences with this ""monster"" priest who lives only five houses away.  This is a lesson for all young parents: be honest with your children.  This HBO team and family have given us all a ""teachable moment"".  Outstanding!",1308614400,11,895,4.7290322580645165

There is no amount of money that can take away the pain and hurt that was inflicted on Tony, but an honest admission of guilt and willingness to repair the damage would have been a good place to start. The movie was informative and real - too real at times. I think God has reserved a special place in hell for people who use their ""ministry"" to perpetrate these criminal acts, and for the people who know about it and do nothing but lie and cover it up.
The movie is almost embarrasingly personal at times, showing scenes of human anguish that resonate long after the credits roll.

2410782,4,B000BBOUAO,"Tony Comes is a firefighter in Toledo, Ohio.  As a teenager attending Central Catholic High School in the 1980's, he and others were repeatedly molested by priest and religion teacher Dennis Gray.  Later in life when Tony, his wife, and 2 children move to a nice suburban neighborhood in Toledo, they're shocked to find that the serial child molester Dennis Gray now lives only 5 houses away from them on the same street.

In June of 2002, Tony met with Toledo diocese bishop James Hoffman to relate his story of sexual abuse.  The bishop lied to Tony and stated that Dennis Gray had molested only him.  Subsequent news reports attested to 6 additional men who reported they were molested by Dennis Gray at the same high school in the same time frame. Several of these victims are interviewed in this program.  In September, Tony filed a lawsuit against the Catholic Church and in December he contacted the media.

The Catholic Church is shown to be very uncooperative with the media and attorneys in regards to these sensitive issues.  This becomes clearer when information is discovered that a large, influential law firm working for the church has been silencing victims and quietly settling sexual abuse lawsuits for years all over Ohio.  In fact, the church themselves knew all along about Dennis Gray and even other priests who were abusing children.  The church, bishops, and priests all worked in collusion to cover it up until it was exposed by the media.  Under canon law (the rules by which the Catholic Church lives by) priests are authorized to lie if it's in the best interests of the church to protect it from scandal.

In 2004, Tony and 21 other victims talked about a settlement with the Toledo diocese.  Tony was eventually offered a paltry sum of 55,000 dollars which he reluctantly accepted.  Only a few short weeks after this, it was discovered that the Toledo diocese had a stock portfolio worth over 100 million dollars.

The actual scope of this abuse perpetrated by priests is massive by any measure of the word.  In a surprising act of honesty and revelation, a study commissioned by the U.S. Catholic Church showed that since 1950, there have been 11,750 reported cases of children who were sexually abused by 5,148 priests in the United States.

`Twist of Faith' is a sobering and heartbreaking documentary showing the guilt, pain, and suffering that was endured by Tony Comes and many resulting after effects that caused turmoil in his life and marriage.  This is also a significant look at a legacy of deceit, corruption, and aberrant behavior in several elements of the Catholic Church.",1180051200,17,2617,4.8558558558558556

2410784,5,B000BBOUAO,"I kept hoping all throughout the entire documentary that Tony and his wife would end up leaving the roman catholic church.  (It was certainly the best thing I ever did, and I was never molested there or mistreated in any way, I just always hated the phony-baloney double standards and outright lies I knew existed even as a kid).  But no, he lets his daughter take part in the first communion thing and spends all that time being in anguish and not turning away from the whole filthy rotten organization, which is what you MUST do if you are honest with yourself in the end.  His wife was not raised a roman catholic and talked briefly about checking out a nondenominational church nearby.  Tony and she would have been embraced there and would possibly have learned some actual bible, which is the only place the truth about Christianity can be found.  The mention of the fact that a bishop is allowed and will lie to ""protect"" the catholic church cinches it for me - it's nothing but an organization of lies and always has been!  And Tony said to his mom in effect that to be part of such a thing after getting the truth is to be in collaboration with it.  Amen.  Yet people stay in it because they think some other man (a priest, no matter how flawed he is) has some holy power over them.  Martin Luther was a devout catholic monk who read the book of Romans one day and found a truth that the catholic church does not believe in, that ""the just shall live by faith,"" and he knew he could not be part of the travesty anymore.",1154390400,14,1528,4.352112676056338
8084530,4,B000BBOUAO,"As a man, as a gay man, and as a non-practicing Catholic who was raised on the ""cusp"" - before and after Vatican II - I couldn't watch this documentary in one sitting. It simply brought up too much sadness and rage at an institution that has emptied its pews of people like me because of its truly vile, evil, and most disturbing of all, the casual treatment of the victims of sexual abuse perpetrated by its clergy. Yet, while I was non-practicing, I did teach and direct a CCD program for 5 years. I did it for my parish community and because there were many parents who felt the need for their children to receive Catholic religious instruction.

I was able to put aside the Vatican's slanders about the pedophiles being ""gay"", of gay men being ""evil"" and ""intrinsically disordered"".

What broke it for me, finally, was when the diocese required that its volunteers to submit to fingerprinting, background checks, etc. Then I realized that this wasn't about trying to repair the damage that couldn't be undone, lawyers and its insurance companies. When I resigned, I told the parish priest - who has since passed and was a gentle, holy, pastoral presence -that the problem was not with volunteers, but with its clergy and that by acquiescing I was also perpetuating. What does this have to do with the film? It let me put a face on the damage done not just to children, but to families, to the communities, and to the cycle this continues.

As one interviewee suggested, any bishop who did nothing or, worse, simply moved these priests around, aren't leaders and they should resign immediately. I would add ""and publicly"". Maybe some of us could begin again; doubtful, but maybe.

An acknowledgement that it is the Church, not simply the priests, who have made a pattern and practice of molesting the faith of 1 billion Catholics might be a start. Failing that, watch this film.",1521158400,,1881,4.6909090909090905

8084535,5,B000BBOUAO,"Absolutely heartbreaking. When this report first came out, I wondered how any Catholic could support a religion of pedophiles. Then it became more and more disgusting, as it was happening in almost every community, and EVERY State. The church knew this was happening, and just moved these homosexual  pedophiles from town to town. The Canon Laws are outrageous...priests can do ANY vile act they want, then lie about it to protect the church....WHAT? My belief has been...the church was to save souls, not destroy them. I believe these predators are still, very much, active today. How can anyone, continue to go to a church that is filled with such evil? And NO...you don't forgive evil.",1481500800,3,688,4.982608695652174
