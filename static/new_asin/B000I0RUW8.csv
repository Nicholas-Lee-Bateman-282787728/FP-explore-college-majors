8143117,3,B000I0RUW8,"This one is about a boy from a beautiful hill region who pursues a girl to Mumbai. She rejects him and he makes a false start with girl #2 who dumps him. Then he finally gets it together with girl #3 who is very insecure because of her history and believes all men cheat. So what happens when girls #1 and 2 come back and make a play for him - and girl #3 catches him each time...? This is a teen romance type movie even if the leads are a little out of their teens.
I like Shahid Kapoor and he is fine for this part. As usual his dancing is the best part of it. Unfortunately we didn't think there was much chemistry with any of the 3 girls (Ayesha Takia, Tulip Joshi and Soha Ali Khan) - and the way it was written or directed really didn't have one that stood out so much you were cheering for her. The music also was fine but I didn't find myself drawn to anything particularly. The hill countryside was beautiful to look at though.
So an OK way to spend time and great if you are a Shahid fan and want to cover his movies and dances. However he has done more memorable stuff than this one. Elsewhere on the Net it mostly tends to get about average (about 5-6 out of 10. However it can get as low as 2 and high as 9!)",1238889600,3,1221,3.967479674796748
