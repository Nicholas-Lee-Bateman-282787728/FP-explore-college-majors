2352128,5,B000A2WDVW,"This film with The Last Wave marks the period of Weir's filmmaking--the Australian period--I love best. He is in his element. There is mystery and magic in the imagery, the music and the storytelling in general. In both Picnic and Wave the viewer is left to fill in the blanks with personal knowledge of how the world works (some anthropological understanding of the region and its native people furthers one's comprehension of the story's significance).

When I last viewed Picnic in a large theater (being screened along with Wave), the place was packed. People were sitting in the aisles and standing three-deep at the back of theater. Fortunately for them without seats, the fire department didn't throw them out; and fortunately for the rest of us, there was no need.

Watch the film and interpret the film's meaning for yourself. I don't want to spoil the spell of watching it by giving anything away. Most of you will want to dig deeper into the meaning of the story after watching; but that wonder won't spoil the frisson the film brings with even a rudimentary understanding that there are many things in this world we know little about.",1396051200,21,1146,4.812182741116751

To be fair and a little bit more reasonable, I believe that women might take some offense to some of this stuff.

2352134,4,B000A2WDVW,"Peter Weir greatly improved upon Joan Lindsay's novel of like name (in particular by choosing not to follow her storyline to its controversial ""closed secret"" ending) in this brilliantly-shot, capably-acted and at times intensely spooky story from 1975. A slow, quiet film, noted for the ""intoxicated/otherworldly"" quality of some of its imagery, Picnic at Hanging Rock helped establish Weir's reputation on an international scale.

On Saint Valentine's Day, 1900, an outing from Appleyard College, near Victoria, Australia, sets in motion a maddening psychological mystery which follows the disappearance of several schoolgirls in the midst of a picnic at the foot of a famed geological formation locally called Hanging Rock. The girls, led the popular Miranda (played by the strikingly beautiful Anne-Louise Lambert) set off on foot to climb the rock and shortly after reaching the summit of the structure, seemingly vanish from the face of the earth. Weeks of investigation by police and searches by hundreds of locals fail to turn up either the missing girls or any evidence that might suggest an explanation for what may have befallen them. As this frustratingly impossible mystery intrudes into the inner landscapes of those at the college and the local community as a whole, life attempts to continue for those who knew the missing students. Gradually and by degrees the incident at the rock changes (and ruins?) many at the college and beyond, most especially the institution's beleaguered headmistress, Mrs. Appleyard, who takes to drink, and becomes increasingly dictatorial.

Picnic at Hanging Rock is among the more hypnotic motion pictures ever made, and a viewer is soon lulled into a physically relaxed but mentally heightened state as the perplexing turn of events onscreen weaves a dense spell. The scenery Weir employs is simply striking, be it manmade or the natural majesty of the simultaneously immense and claustrophobic Hanging Rock itself. Striking also is the memorable soundtrack, worth listening to in its own right, with Bruce Smeaton's work achieving a near-perfect marriage of sound to image.

Some may react strongly to the conclusion of the film, which I won't further comment on here, but I can't imagine anyone would walk away from Picnic at Hanging Rock feeling unimpressed. It is worth seeing, and if you can find it, worth owning.",1230681600,40,2367,5.273209549071618

2352204,4,B000A2WDVW,"Quite a lovely, languid film. Very erotic in a subtle way. The music was what got me--here were these bucolic scenes with thundering, ""something is very wrong"" music.
It's Valentine's Day, 1900. A group of Australian school girls go on a picnic at Hanging Rock. There's a thread of sexual tension running through the film. One of the girls, the obvious ""Queen Bee"" is revered by the other girls; one in particular, a girl who is not allowed to go on the picnic because she has been bad. Also picnicking at Hanging Rock are a young English aristocrat with his aunt, uncle and their servant, aged around 20. Again, there is a hint of sexual tension between the young lord and the servant. Then they spot four girls who have broken away from the group to explore, and the lord goes off to follow them.
Soon it's obvious that three of the four girls are lost on Hanging Rock. A teacher goes looking for them and she doesn't return. The rest of the girls and their guardians go back to the school and then the town goes back to search. The young lord is very shaken up over the disappearance of the girls and in an obsessive manner, goes off to look for them. He falls ill and is taken to a hospital.
The film, based on a book by the same name, leaves a lot of unanswered questions. Hanging Rock is considered sacred to the aboriginal people so was it angry gods who stole the girls away? Did the young lord murder them? Did the girls run away together or with lovers?
The movie is disturbing in a quiet way. It's lovely to look at but there is a constant feeling that something is off kilter. This is definitely an ""art"" film so if you like your plots wrapped up in a tidy package at the end of 90 minutes, this is not the movie for you.",1484438400,3,1733,4.286585365853658

2352207,4,B000A2WDVW,"After watching the movie, I couldn't but to order the dvd right away. Sometimes it was quite boring but above all, it was beautiful.
The combination of music, cinematography and beautiful actors and the result was pure picture like beauty.
The music contains pan flute, piano and organ sound that makes the movie more classy.
The cinematography contains beautiful nature shots and night shots with candle lights. They are all very well shot.
The story is very simple. Back in 1900, a bunch of school girls go on a picnic with teachers to the Hanging Rock and 3 of them were lost. At the end only one were found.
They searched all over but no more were found.
The beauty of this movie is the picnic moment and the night shot of the school dormatory.
Each movement of the girls in the nature are just pure art. Slow motions and with beautiful background make it look like one of those postcard look.
Maybe the story itself was not even matter for this movie at all.
It was like a canvas. Showing beautiful moments to the audience.
There are no hurry moments at all. Everything were happening so slow.
We just enjoy each moments with peace.
Even though there are incidents happening.
Peter Weir is good at storytelling. We all know that. But this movie, he didn't seems to care at all.
You should know that before watching this film.
If you want a peaceful moment for 1:40:00 and just enjoy the beauty, this is the right film.
And the other surprise is it is 5.1 stereo. IT was made back in 1975 !

2352259,5,B000A2WDVW,"I'm from Texas.  Bonus disc 1, on the 3-disc UK disc set I purchased a year or two ago or more on Amazon, is one of the few reasons I acquired a region-free portable DVD player to supplement my movie viewing.  Bonus disc 1 contains the original theatrical version of Picnic at Hanging Rock from 1975, as did a now extremely rare Vestron VHS from the 1980s.  Eventually, a newer VHS version, and finally a DVD version, were issued with, instead, the director's cut.  The original version is a gem; the director's cut, in my opinion, less so.  I have seen the original version at least six or seven times.  Anne-Louise Lambert, who plays Miranda in the movie, is on record as preferring it as well.  Specifically: (1) The searchers finally give up on the extremely mysterious disappearance of the women who have vanished.  A memorial service is thus held at a church.  The parishioners, in the original version, sing ""Rock of Ages/Cleft for me/Let me hide myself/In thee"" without anybody raising nary a peep pointing to the spine-chill irony of the hymn's words.  It's one of several creepy subtleties one picks up on by repeated viewings.  Then the director's cut comes along and deletes the church service, and the singing of the hymn, completely!!  (2) Two of the characters in the movie, at different times after falling asleep (some sort of unexplained mysterious sedation, almost) at the site of the disappearance, end up with cuts at precisely the same location on their respective foreheads.  These matching injuries likewise go, eerily, totally unremarked upon in the movie, another of the same several creepy subtleties one begins to notice by watching the original version multiple times.  The director's cut then deletes certain segments of the movie so as to remove, and in so doing un-highlight, most of the depictions of the shared forehead cuts and the associated creepy mystery of them.  I think there may be a third or fourth examples of director's cut examples which detract from what a moviewatcher detective would notice by studying the original version.  So the UK 3-disc version does well by including the original movie version, and I just wish there was an NTSC-format DVD with the original version so that North American viewers could become acquainted with it.",1437523200,5,2285,4.911458333333333

2352262,3,B000A2WDVW,"Extremely suspenseful and Haunting version of Joan Lindsay's novel Picnic at Hanging rock
which is actually based on a True story of Group of school girls with their School teachers
 going out for a Picnic at Hanging rock near Mt Macedon in Victoria Australia
on Feb 14 year 1900 several school girls went missing around the Hanging rock area
the local police at the time, British police actually, back at the turn of the 20th century
Australia still had a mix of British & Australian authorities running the country
for those fans who don't know British sailor captain James Cook officially Discovered Australia
there were other foreign sailors that did pass through Australia before Cook, but James cook put his official stamp naming it his own
anyway the local police did a search of the area and found no survivors
according to the book or the film thou only 1 Girl was found some days later unconscious near the Rock formation
very traumatised by what happened she could not explain herself when questioned by the Police
very supernatural atmosphere
Australian director Peter weir Directed this film and i tell you what all the scenes are very suspenseful and supernatural
especially the scenes where the school girls go for a walk around and in between the rock formation
the music composed for these scenes very supernatural that's for sure
one of the most strangest haunting Disapeareances in Australia's History
very strange/bizarre almost a supernatural incident

this film is now on Blu-ray, U.K. Distributor Second sight released the film first back in 2010 & then criterion blu-ray released it 2nd
second sight's new High definition transfer of the Directors cut version in 1:78:1 widescreen
which is longer cut with extra scenes inserted back in the film
looks very sharp & clear, no Dirt or Grain better than the film has ever looked
plus a new 5.1 Master audio mix
plus all new special features to
DREAM WITHIN A DREAM-60min retrospective making of Documentary
with Director Peter weir, Producer Hal McElroy and other cast & crew from the film
RECOLLECTION-HANGING ROCK 1900, on the set 1975 behind the scenes footage
JOAN LINDSAY interview
HANGING ROCK & MARTINDALE, a tour of the filming locations then & now
and some scenes Deleted for the Directors cut

now the Criterion collection blu-ray/DVD combo is very similar to the U.K. release
well Criterion's HD transfer is taken from the second sight release
the special features from the criterion blu-ray are exactly the same as the second sight blu-ray
Criterion have also added a new one on one interview with Peter weir himself
so both versions are the same, the only difference is the packaging actually
the second sight blu-ray is just standard blu-ray case which is what i prefer
the criterion blu-ray is fold out Digi-pak which i find annoying
if criterion are going to release a blu-ray /DVD combo they can pack it in clamshell plastic case
but instead criterion decided to release this film in fold out Digi-pak
each to their own actually you either like fold out Digi-pak packaging or plastic case packaging
by the way this criterion blu-ray/dvd is region A/1 locked
where is the second sight blu-ray is of course region B locked
so if you decide to buy the second sight blu-ray because of the packaging
you need a all regions player
Definitely time to upgrade and get the criterion blu-ray or the second sight blu-ray
5 stars for the film, 3 stars for the packaging",1430265600,,3444,4.883760683760684

2352304,5,B000A2WDVW,"Peter Weir's ""Picnic at Hanging Rock"" takes the psychological thriller (think ""Don't Look Now"" for comparison) in some interesting and uncharted directions but manages to keep the audience engaged. Based on a popular novel, Weir's tale of school girls that go missing near a reportedly enchanted rock outcropping doesn't focus on what happened to the girls so much as it does the impact of their disappearance on those they've left behind. If you're expecting a traditional narrative, you're looking in the wrong place.

The Criterion edition is a big upgrade over their previous DVD edition. Weir supervised the 4K transfer of his film himelf ensuring that we get a transfer that is true to the natural film look of the original and eschews the overuse of digital noise reduction and grain management which often times makes older films look like they were shot on high def video.

This release is a combo DVD/blu-ray (before Criterion elected to do away with this approach). The blu-ray is one dual layered disc while the DVD features the movie with a few extras on the dual layered DVD and the bulk of the extras on the second DVD. The orginal audio is presented along with an updated 5.1 lossless mix.

Packaged with a copy of the original novel (which has been out-of-print for some time)AND a booklet with an essay, Criterion has largely done a terrific job here. My only complaint is I personally dislike cardboard holders because they don't take shelf wear very well. The discs are housed in a thin cardboard package and that, along with the essay and the novel, are housed in a slightly bigger cardboard box.

Weir's film isn't for everyone. Weir explores the mystical aspects of the local culture much as he did with ""The Last Wave"" (I'm still waiting for a great blu-ray edition of this thriller). ""Picnic"" isnt' about HOW and WHY the girls disappeared (or even where they disappeared to) but about the psychological impact it has on the school and those around them. For those expecting a more traditional thriller that solves all the elements of the mystery, you'd do well to look elsewhere as this film doesn't play by those rules.",1426377600,7,2145,4.820652173913044
2352305,5,B000A2WDVW,A Very Good Movie !,1424822400,,19,3.0
2352306,5,B000A2WDVW,"Years ago I bought the original Criterion Collection DVD edition of ""Picnic at Hanging Rock"".  The back of the DVD box claims the movie is in widescreen format, but it is not.  It is letterboxed; widescreen in a 4:3 format. I guess that works with the older 4:3 TVs, but on the new standard 16:9 sets, it leaves black bars on the right, left, top, and bottom of the screen.  This new Blu-ray/DVD edition finally gets it right, giving us a true widescreen version of the film.  Here are some observations on this new edition:

The new DVD is dual-layer, and slightly larger (7.37GB) than the original Criterion DVD (6.57GB).  I note this because very often the DVDs included with BD/DVD sets are single-layer, inferior versions of the DVD compared to DVD-only versions of a film you can buy.  I give Criterion credit for not doing this with the DVD here; it is a quality version of the film.  The only real difference between the original DVD and the new one is that the new DVD is in 16:9 format, compared to the letterboxed original DVD.  The quality of the video is improved over the original, but there is some grain and a lot of artifacts visible.

The Blu-ray disk is also in 16:9 format, of course.  The film quality is very good, but not great; I assume that is due to the condition of the master that was used to create the new disks.  But the BD version removes all the artifacts seen on the DVD, so it is a definitive improvement in that way.  Colors are more vibrant and more detail is visible, too, with very little grain evident.  You certainly want to watch the BD disk, not the DVD.  I'm being a bit over-critical when I say the video quality is not great.  It is so much better than the original Criterion DVD, and really looks fine.

There are two DVDs in this new edition.  One contains the movie, the other contains the extras.  The Blu-ray disk includes both the film and the same extras that are on the second DVD.

I am a bit surprised that this new set is ""director-approved"", with the transfer supervised by Peter Weir himself.  I say that because Weir changed the format of the film for this new version.  The film was originally produced in 1.66:1 format, which is not the same as the 16:9 version we see here.  16:9 fills the whole screen, while 1.66:1 is slightly wider and narrower.  If the film were in 1.66:1 format here, there would be small black bars at the top and bottom of a 16:9 screen.  Personally, I would prefer that over this modified version.  We lose a little bit of information on the right and left sides of the screen, since it had to be slightly cropped to make it fit a 16:9 screen (trust me; I obsessively compared the two versions of the film and confirmed this).  I always prefer the original format of a film over one modified in any way.  I wish this new BD were in the original format.  But that is a minor quibble, since this is a much better version than the original letterboxed DVD, and very little is lost in this new version, certainly nothing of any importance.  Finally we get to see the film fill our screens, instead of having a tiny film with black bars on the sides, top, and bottom of the screen!

The audio is improved on the Blu-ray disk, too.  The original Criterion DVD had Dolby 5.1 mix; the new BD is DTS-HD Master Audio, which means it is bit-for-bit identical to the studio master.  The audio is center-channel heavy, with little to no surround effects, the same as the original DVD.  I would have liked more enveloping sound, especially in the outdoor scenes, with insects and birds buzzing around.  But again, I'm being a bit picky.

The inclusion of the book the movie was made from is a terrific bonus, too.  That alone adds greatly to the value of this edition of the film.  I hope this becomes more of a trend for disk releases of films that are made from books, if the authors or their estates allow it.

Of course, my review here is more about the technical aspects of the new BD/DVD set than the film itself.  I give this new set 5 stars both for the technical improvements (in spite of my nit-picking), and because this has long been one of my favorite films.  it is a great film, one that sticks in your mind long after you've watched it, and one you will want to watch more than once.  Finally we have it in a format that it deserves!",1424476800,7,4322,4.384905660377359

Film centers around the disappearance of three school girls and their teacher. Eventually one girl is found but she is unable or unwilling to tell what happened to the other girls and their teacher. The viewer is required to think and decide for themselves what actually happened to the lost women. For me the girls and their teacher didn't disappear but escaped the repressed attitudes of Victorian Australia. Hanging Rock itself is a volcanic outcropping, similar to Devil's Tower in WY which has the mysterious ability to disorientate the hiker and cause you to easily get lost.

2352375,4,B000A2WDVW,"Picnic at Hanging Rock looks fantastic on Blu-Ray as its hypnotic mood and atmosphere are preserved through a stunning transfer and excellent audio track that features an absolutely eerie soundtrack.

David Thomson Introduction features the noted film scholar putting Weirs film in the context of Australian cinema at the time it was made and how it ushered in a new sensibility. He also ponders some of the mysteries of the film.

There is a 2003 interview with Peter Weir where he talks about his fascination with the source material and how it drove him to adapt it. He recounts meeting the author on her farm and auditioning for her in order to get approval to make the film. He also addresses some of the mysteries contained in the story.

Everything Begins and Ends. This is a retrospective featurette with key cast and crew members including Miranda herself, Anne Lambert. The producers take us through the projects origins while the actresses share filming anecdotes. They offer their impressions of author Lindsay as well.

A RecollectionHanging Rock 1900 is a vintage 1975 on-the-set documentary that offers a fascinating look at the production. In addition to key cast and crew members, Lindsay is interviewed. They all speak highly of the film as this featurette sheds light on things like the spooky backstory to the building that was used for the school.

Homesdale is the 1971 short film that Weir made. It got the attention of executive producer Patricia Lovell who approached him to direct Picnic at Hanging Rock.

Finally, there is a trailer.

Also included is a copy of Lindsays book, which is a nice touch.

Unfortunately, it does not have the 90-minute retrospective documentary A Dream Within a Dream that can be found on the U.K. Blu-Ray release or the many extras included on the Second Sight Region 2 DVD.",1404777600,,1830,4.9188311688311686
2352376,4,B000A2WDVW,"Wait for the two Other versions of This Film On Blue Ray,  Criterion's version is fine for the Movie ,but their handling of the extras is another thing ,I don't know the reason, Most of The wonderful extras from Second Sights Pal 3 DVD Set are not on this Blue Ray.
Worst is the Missing 16x9 scenes cut from the Original version and the MUCH BETTER and longer Documentary""A Dream within a Dream"" ! Which for some reason Criterion didn't include ,instead we got a cut down version of the interview with Peter Weir taken from that Documentary, But that's not all that Criterion overlooked ,Stills and Poster art, a audio interview, and a
video interview with the Joan Lindsey a small Then and Now comparison
Luckily there are two new Blue Rays coming out ,which include these extras ,The Same company who did the the Pal dvd

2352378,5,B000A2WDVW,"""Picnic at Hanging Rock"" (1975) is directed by Peter Weir (Gallipoli, The Last Wave, The Truman Show, Master and Commander, Dead Poet's Society, Witness, Mosquito Coast) and based on the novel by Joan Lindsay. The movie was thought to have some historical fact though was essentially written from the dreams of Joan Lindsay. The film is set in 1900s and is about the disappearance of four girls on a picnic at Hanging Rock. The film has a dream like quality at times that blends a subtle form of horror and mystery. This film is often mentioned when discussing the emergence of the Australian New Wave of filmmaking that lasted for about ten years from the early 1970s to the 1980s.

Criterion has done a wonderful job with this release which includes numerous features such as the making of the film, interviews with the director, actors, producers, film scholars, and the author. Also included is an earlier film by Weir called ""Homesdale""(1971). There is a booklet featuring an essay by Megan Abbott, and excerpt from film critic Marek Haltof. And remarkably there is also included a nearly 200 page pocket copy of the novel ""Picnic at Hanging Rock.""",1403395200,14,1153,4.852791878172589
2352379,5,B000A2WDVW,"I can't explain why this film is one of my Top 5 favorites of all time. Maybe it's the beautiful cinematography, the stellar acting, incredibly foreboding atmosphere. Something about it just resonates within me and I find myself getting lost in it's beauty, like when you're just waking up from a wonderful dream and you try to stay in that world just a bit longer. This is a gorgeous Criterion edition, it comes housed with a new edition of the original novel, which I'm looking forward to reading soon.

2352380,5,B000A2WDVW,"If you are as big a fan of Peter Weir's ""Picnic at Hanging Rock"" as I am, you will know that it has been long overdue for the Criterion Collection Blu-Ray treatment. Prior to this release, the only editions available in the U.S. were an older Criterion DVD with no special features (save for the trailer) and many other region DVDs with a wealth of special features that were not playable on U.S. DVD players. I was excited to see that Joan Lindsey's original book is included as a part of this edition, which has been previously out of print and difficult to get a hold of. My only complaint is that there are other special features, such as interviews with the girls who played Irma and Edith, available in different edition DVDs that unfortunately were not included on this DVD, so it is not really a definitive edition. Still, the sound and picture quality are beautiful and pristine and the special features are excellent and informative. This is the best Criterion Collection purchase I have ever made and the first time I am aware of their releasing a book along with a movie. Highly recommended for fans of the novel and film, you will NOT be disappointed.",1403049600,7,1164,4.600961538461538
2352381,5,B000A2WDVW,"Australian director Peter Weir made his first major impression with both film critics and the public with PICNIC AT HANGING ROCK, a strange, haunting underplayed horror story.  There are no monsters...no ghosts...simply a frightening, sexually suggestive, yarn that remains in a viewers consciousness long after the picture has ended.

On Valentines Day in 1901, three young schoolgirls and their teacher disappear without a trace while on an excursion to Hanging Rock, a peculiar geological outcropping.

What happened to them?  We never find out.

Eerie, moody, the 1975 release is based on a novel by Joan Lindsay and stars Rachel Roberts as the schools headmistress, Helen Morse as a teacher and features Jacki Weaver as a maid at the school.  Russell Boyds color cinematography is stunning.

The new 3-disc set (1 Blu-ray/2 DVD) from The Criterion Collection contains a remastered high-definition digital film transfer, supervised by Weir with a 5.1 surround DTS-HD Master Audio soundtrack on the Blu-ray.  Extras include an extended interview with Weir, a new featurette on the making of the film, featuring interviews from 2003 with executive producer Patricia Lovell, producers Hal McElroy and Jim McElroy and several cast members.  There is also a new Introduction by film scholar David Thomson, a vintage on-set documentary that includes interviews with Weir, actress Rachel Roberts and source novel author Joan Lindsay.  Additionally, the set includes HOMESDALE (1971), an award-winning black comedy by Weir.

Printed matter in this impressive set consists of a booklet containing essays on the film and Weir by Megan Abbott and Marek Haltof, plus a new paperback edition of Joan Lindsays original novel, which was previously out of print in the United States.

2352382,2,B000A2WDVW,"It started out pretty cool. The reverberations on the bass. The last shot in slow mo of the three girls disappearing into the path in the mountain. (occurring about 1/4 of the way through)
BUT THEN!
It just droned on and on. I got so sick of the characters, the ""plot"" if you can call it that. The only character I even mildly liked was the dark haired boy who drank from the bottle. And the blonde girl but only because she was pretty. I mean really man! It was so bad.
The last three quarters of the movie you're just waiting and watching despite yourself to see if they'll find the girls. Every scene that follows is just EVERYTHING BUT finding the girls. Then it ends...AND THEY DON'T FIND THE GIRLS! well, just one of them. very disappointing and a waste of my time.

2352383,5,B000A2WDVW,"This beautiful Peter Weir film was the breakthrough movie of the so-called Australian New Wave. Quality film making was virtually non-existent in my home country at the time until this gem came along. Based on a classic Joan Lindsay novel (is it fact or fiction or a fascinating combination of both?) and set in  Hanging Rock, a beautiful and unusual landmark in rural Victoria in1900, this is an intriguing unsolved mystery which will leave you mesmerized. Although the two leads are played by British actors, it is the supporting cast led by Helen Morse, Jacki Weaver (yes, that Jacki of two recent Oscar nominations), Patricia Kennedy and the beautiful Anne Louise Lambert as the enigmatic Miranda that make this film so special.  Superb photography by Russell Boyd and a haunting score by Bruce Smeaton add immensely to the film's timeless quality. But most credit goes to  Peter Weir whose brilliant directing not only made ""Picnic"" a classic but was instrumental in lifting the flagging Australian film industry into the world market. And subsequent Weir films have not disappointed.  If you haven't seen this mini-masterpiece before, you  are going to be surprised and enchanted by its rich and unusual qualities.",1396915200,8,1220,5.110552763819095

8072855,5,B000A2WDVW,"I read a review of the movie in or around 1975 / 76.  Didn't get to see the movie until I purchased the DVD 50 years after the novel was written.
Back then, I saw a black and white photo of a scene from the movie in the movie review (featured in a newspaper) and was intrigued by the mystery.  I am still intrigued after watching the DVD.  Have watched parts of the movie around 10 times since it was delivered to me a few weeks ago - the scenes when Miranda and three other girls were exploring the rocks amidst an eerie humming sound from rocks that look like faces of the Easter Island monoliths.  Creepy even in broad daylight.  The pan flute music has been ringing in my ears since watching the DVD.  The movie has 'hooked' me - I am hooked on a feeling - a creepy feeling.

The DVD comes with special features and we get to see Peter Weir and the actors being interviewed decades after the movie was made.

What I like best about the movie is the unexplained disappearance of three of the girls (two of whom were never found) and the location of the movie - where else but the actual Hanging Rocks.  Director Peter Weir was wise to follow the novel.  It was also wise for the book publisher to skip 'Chapter 18' that the author Lindsay had written - it would have damaged the appeal of the mystery.",1519862400,,1304,4.221774193548387
