8082191,4,B000B66GT2,There's an odd quality to this movie that is hard to put your finger on. I got the feeling at one point the director or maybe writer wanted to make a serious horror film but in came Blue Demon looking like a god among men and they cast him before thinking it all the way through. It's not a bad thing. I mean I got to see Blue Demon read the Necronomicon in full Blue Demon gear. It's also not the first time I've watched him fight a Dracula type but it doesn't get old. The lighting is oddly designed to make all of this look oddly sinister. It's something that would work if a giant of a man wasn't wearing a fabulous outfit. Decisions were made and at that point they stuck with it. It's a double minded movie but worth checking out.,1459900800,,736,4.118055555555555
