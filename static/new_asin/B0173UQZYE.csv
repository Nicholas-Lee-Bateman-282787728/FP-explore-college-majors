The manga itself was broken into 2 seasons. 2wei Hertz is the second half, and final true Prisma Illya since a few chapters in they decided to make 3rei a standard Fate style Shirou fights everyone (see: bloody mess, no longer a comedy, unnecessary gory death of major characters), and Illya hasn't made an appearence since the first couple of chapters.",1458000000,3,382,4.803030303030303

7489243,5,B0173UQZYE,"Magical girl mayhem continues in the second season of the Fate/Kaleid Liner series, which is indeed a spinoff of Fate Stay Night and Fate Zero. Please note that this is the first half of the second season which is called 2wei. This collection does wrap things up rather nicely, unlike many other anime where it is mandatory to watch the second half of the series. The second half of the second season (which is called 2wei Herz) should be released by the same distributor, Sentai Filmworks, hopefully later this year.

If you have not watched the first season, then you should just stop right now and watch it because this season would be too confusing without prior knowledge. With that said, this is a wacky, crazy show, but it should be known that this season contains some naughty moments, mostly girls kissing each other and lots of baths. The first season was a suggested rating of TV14, but this season has a rating of TVMA, probably because the cover makes this look like a show for 12 year old girls, but the rating may make some reconsider. As I said, this does have many bathing scenes and kissing scenes, and since the main cast is almost entirely female, some people may have problems with this. If you have been watching anime for at least the last few years, then you would know about this and probably have no problem with this since it would not be the first show like this.

As the cover suggests, there are 10 episodes in this collection as well as 3 short episodes, which are listed under special features, along with TV spots. The English dub uses the same voices from the first season, and introduces new voices for the new characters (obviously.) If you liked the dub from the first season, then you will like this dub as well. If you did not like the English dub, then just watch the Japanese.

Despite the warnings I talked about earlier, I did like it a lot and would recommend it to fans of the first season as well as fans of Fate Stay Night who have a humorous side and like cute characters. If are looking for family friendly anime, you should check out Angelic Layer, Princess Tutu, Squid Girl, and Oblivion Island.",1453939200,5,2146,4.525773195876289

8738042,1,B0173UQZYE,"I said that season 1 wasn't God-Awful, and it had some saving graces. This one IS God-Awful.
I swear, the more I watch this show, the more and more I'm reminded of ""My Immortal"" (worst Harry Potter fanfiction ever written), because these two share so many of the same tropes. Focusing on pointless sexual content when they should be focusing on the plot, a lot of boring and pointless filler (even though the seasons aren't THAT long), a few deus ex machinas, a lot of the characters act REALLY stupid. And I mean that in the most literal way.
In this season, Illya gets pretty much a twin sister/clone of herself that takes on the power and form of the Archer class card, and she is named ""Kuro"". Kuro goes around making out with all of Illya's friends (who are still about 10 or 11 year old girls, mind you), and their teacher. It's revealed that this is the way she restores her mana, since Kuro is pretty much the embodiment of the Archer Servant now. I'm pretty certain that's not how it works, even going by the H scenes from the Fate visual novels. It's just an excuse to pander to the lolicon yuri fanbase. So, Kuro makes out with everyone, and they think that it's Illya who did it, even though Kuro's skin is significantly more tan, and her eyes are yellow. Are they REALLY so blind that they can't tell the difference? They also add a lot of incestual undertones, where apparently Illya has developed a crush on her big brother, Shirou. (Ok, in all fairness, they're not related by blood. He's adopted, but it's still creepy.) So, take the recipe for disaster from earlier: Fate/Stay Night+Sailor Moon+Cardcaptor+My Immortal, and add ""Kiss x Sis"" into the mix, and you get this turd.

However, I do have to mention that one of the OVAs for this season shows Ruby getting abused, which she well deserves, since she's the worst character in the show.
I had many more complaints with this, and it's been several months since I watched the show, but this is all just stuff I remember off the top of my head.

Now, the ONE big saving grace it has is the battle sequence at the end of the season, and the introduction of Bazzett. That was freakin' amazing, and it gave me high hopes for season 3.....

Spoiler, my hopes were misplaced. Season 3 gets even WORSE.",1470960000,3,2266,4.495145631067961

8738045,5,B0173UQZYE,"Being a second season you do have an idea whether you are interested in this by now. But, might as well recap anyways. This is the BD for the first half of the second arc of Fate / Kaleid Liner Prisma Illya. This arc being longer than the first required two seasons to do. This is the first part of that.

The show remains a mixture of the Fate/Stay Night universe that we know and a magical girl show that doesn't might poking at those standard magical girl cliches. This season as much as the last has fun with the ridiculousness of transformation sequences that take up real time and acknowledging when it is touching on some cliches.

It does have some slice of life moments, some comedy, and some really good action spread through the series. The plot of 2wei focusing a lot around the appearance of a new character Kuro who does have a pretty good arc. Season ends with one heck of a good showdown that lets it stand out pretty effectively. Definitely worth seeing those fights with BD quality.

The season is 10 episodes with 3 of the OVAs (not all that were released though). 9 episodes on disc 1 and episode 10 and the OVAs on disc 2. There is a dub so you have the option of the original voice work (which I'd suggest sticking with) or the dub cast.

This is the season where the show starts finding its own path and story. Definitely worth I think.",1461196800,7,1359,4.338582677165355
