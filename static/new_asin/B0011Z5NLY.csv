3070544,5,B0011Z5NLY,"I really enjoyed this DVD and found it to be a great workout even though I saw some other reviews on a different site that said she stuttered a lot and appeared nervous. I didn't see this so much...just a couple times where there was a little hesitance, but that's it. Otherwise I enjoyed Annie and thought she was a great instructor. Some of the other gals like Allison go a little too fast and it takes me 2-3 times to catch all the moves. Annie is paced just right and this workout is good and varies my Firm workouts. I have been doing The Firm since the late 80s and I'm glad they are still making great workouts. I'm also glad no step box is required here as I got tired of buying all the different ones as they changed series.",1211587200,8,733,4.169014084507042
3070545,5,B0011Z5NLY,"I'm not always a The Firm fan, but lately they've brought out some great workouts and this is one of them.  I really enjoy doing it and already found it to be beneficial after only four times doing it.
It's a 45 minute routine and it's all standing and floor toning.  It's led by Annie Lee who I found to be very friendly, encouraging and cues well.  Sometimes you'll work one muscle alone, and other times, you are working multiple body parts in one go.  You begin with one move and then incorporate add on moves to include more body parts.  This is what's going to help you maximise the fat burning and lose weight.
As I said, I've already done this four times and feel the benefit from it.  If The Firm are going to be bringing more workouts like this out, then I'm going to keep buying them.  This is a great workout that you can combine with your cardio workouts.",1210636800,29,868,4.288343558282208
3070546,4,B0011Z5NLY,"This is a good, almost-hour long sculpting workout with great moves. The only reason I gave it 4 stars was because even though Annie is a great cast member in all FIRM workouts, she is not as confident as lead(at least it doesn't seem so). But this is a great FIRM workout and I use it often on sculpting days.",1204934400,12,310,4.183333333333334
3070567,5,B0011Z5NLY,"Loooooved this workout omg!!! Finally, of all the Firm DVDs I own this one is by far the best!! Love the 'no bouncing super complicated cardio' that all the other workouts have that seriously make me want to throw in the towel midway thru...I get my cardio speed walking on alternate days so this workout was a breath of fresh air with concentrated sculpting & weights.  The instructor Annie? Was very easy to follow-Yay!! Hopefully there are other 45 minute firm workouts I can find without all the high intensity cardio ughh:)!!",1461024000,2,530,4.760869565217392
3070568,5,B0011Z5NLY,One of my favorite workouts!,1460937600,,28,4.8
3070569,5,B0011Z5NLY,Annie Lee is clear and concise about what the workouts are all about. She keeps a good pace but has time to explain each different exercise.,1457049600,,140,4.423076923076923
3070570,5,B0011Z5NLY,"This is one of the Pink Fims, and the first to be led by Annie Lee, who has appeared as a background for other Firm workouts.  As mentioned in another review, I have tried quite a few of the Pink Firms and simply don't care that much for most of them.  The pace is either too fast for me in order to lift a decent amount of weight or they are trying to do too many moves at once.  Lunging, then adding a bicep curl, then let's add a leg lift.  As a result I find myself tripping all over the place or staring at the TV in frustration.

Hi-Def Sculpt is a nice workout, the pace is slower so that you can lift heavier for some exercises.  There are other compound exercises included, but it's kept reasonably simple instead of four different moves going on at the same time.  This routine is all sculpting, there is no cardio at all.  There are also stretches sprinkled throughout the workout.  For those with knee issues, there are a lot of lunges.  I find that I will do them either stationary/static or reverse lunges.  I steer clear from forward lunges, you will see some here but it's very simple to do reverse lunges instead.  I should also note that for some of the sets with lunges, you are also doing a compound exercise with a lighter weight.  So while it might seem you are doing endless lunges, not all of them are with heavier weights which helps.

I thought Annie did a nice job leading the overall, she seemed a little nervous and the cueing isn't the best.  But after you do this workout a few times you will know what is coming.  Annie also has a very admirable physique, I found myself staring at her arms for most of the workout.

Along from Total Body Toner and Get Chisel'd, these are the only Pink Firms that I have enjoyed.  I find the slower pace is suitable and geared towards older people like myself.  Overall, I give this workout 4 and a half stars.",1451692800,,1876,4.278409090909091
3070571,4,B0011Z5NLY,"I thought this was too easy at first, but when I started using 8-12 lb weights instead of the suggested ""medium"", it became my go-to for results when I don't feel like a lot of cardio.",1442102400,,184,4.138888888888889
3070572,5,B0011Z5NLY,Annie is fantastic. I have been doing this video for years. I like her stretches in between weight routines. It's a perfectly orchestrated routine.,1440374400,,147,5.166666666666667
3070573,5,B0011Z5NLY,My favorite workout of ALL TIME!  Love Annie Lee and this workout is easy to learn and provides great results!,1438041600,,110,4.5
3070574,5,B0011Z5NLY,I like this work out. It is paced well enough to get a good work out but not so fast that you cannot follow. Annie (the instructor) does a good job of explaining moves and allowing enough time to transition from move to move. Some of the other firm videos go so quickly from move to move that you lose good workout time figuring out the particular part of the routine or feel that you are stumbling over yourself.,1435536000,,413,4.2405063291139244
3070575,5,B0011Z5NLY,"I'm not really one to write reviews for things, but I feel as though these workouts deserve recognition. My first experience with The Firm was a few years ago when I decided to buy and try the Transfirmer series of workouts. I wasn't necessarily a beginner at that time, but man..those workouts kicked my butt! I then ordered the previous body sculpting series videos to rotate to avoid boredom. I had great success with them but for whatever reason, I ended up joining a local gym and the The Firm videos/step began collecting dust. Fast forward to present, a husband and almost 2 year old daughter later, I decided I needed something that worked for me at home bc trying to coordinate a toddler to your desired gym schedule isn't necessarily the easiest task (not to mention wasting so much gas). It dawned on me to re-order some of The Firm workouts, new and older DVDs; no more driving 30 minutes to the gym for me! Let me tell you, as someone who is by no means a beginner when it comes to fitness, these workouts are no joke. I got a better workout with these DVDs than I did at any class or time on the treadmill/elliptical. I HIGHLY recommend them to anyone who wants to get in shape and get there FAST. I can tell a change in my body already-they promise results in 10 workouts, but you'll see it before then. Trust me. What's also great is that you can make them as easy or as challenging as you desire-increase or decrease your weight. Either way, you'll get a great workout!",1431993600,6,1486,4.427007299270073
3070576,3,B0011Z5NLY,"I don't know what I was thinking buying a tape this long, I don't usually buy them over 40 minutes.  I am also used to the tapes that do cardio and sculpt so I thought this was kind of boring being that it was almost all sculpting.  It was too slow for me so I don't know how often I would add this into my routine and I don't think I felt it as much as some of the other tapes, even though it was a longer workout.",1431561600,,415,3.7045454545454546

3070589,5,B0011Z5NLY,"I really like this one, it has 2 work outs on it, 25 min and 45 min. so depending on how much time I have can do either one.  I feel it targets many ""problem"" areas and am hoping to do it more after the Holidays.",1419292800,,212,3.608695652173913
3070590,3,B0011Z5NLY,"If you're experienced with working out, then this  will be a nice addition to your library (if you're not, read on and you'll see why I wouldn't recommend this video for beginners). It's a good, solid, sculpting workout. There are no aerobic sets like there are in other The Firm sculpting videos, so if you're looking for a strengthening and toning routine, this one is good. I've been working out with weights for many years and I found this workout to be moderate - it covers all the major muscle groups and some of the exercises are creative where upper and lower body are combined. I broke a sweat and felt like I worked at the conclusion.

The abs segment is fine for maintenance in a pinch, but be aware that you'll want to try other routines if abs are your focus.

Annie misses cues and misspeaks several times in this video. The first time you do the workout, be aware of this and make sure you watch and listen. You'll figure it out. Moreover, sometimes for a lower body set you'll work one side and then the other, and then at other times you will alternate sides. Annie doesn't tell you which to anticipate, so you have to be ready for either.

This workout claims to require a set of light weights and a set of medium weights (it is suggested that beginners use no weights). The medium weights are used for every set, but I found this to be incongruous. For example, whatever you choose for your medium weight will be used for both lat rows and straight arm front raises. A heavy weight is more appropriate for rows, but if you use that same weight for front raises you may strain yourself. I suggest having heavy, medium, and light weights available. Ignore the cue to pick up your medium weights and choose the appropriate weight for the exercise. You'll want a heavy enough weight to challenge the big muscle groups, but lighter weights for other exercises. Of course it takes some experience to make a safe and appropriate choice.",1414800000,3,1948,4.525568181818182

My only complaint is Annie, the instructor, is kind of dry and ""fake"" and is off queue sometimes but don't let that turn you away from getting this DVD.

The firm is an amazing work out system and I couldn't imagine my work out routine not including them anymore!!

I was searching for workout with weights, I finally found what I was looking for.
This particular workout has a lot of lunges, and you only need small floor space to do the workout.

I finally started using it all the time about a month ago and I cannot believe the results. Makes me wish I had started doing this yrs ago. I have lost 14 lb's since I started the program.

3070620,4,B0011Z5NLY,"I bought this video in a four pack with other Firm workouts - Cardio-Overdrive, Cardio Party, and Hard Core Fusion.  It came with a calendar of how to ease into the program.  I hadn't worked out regularly in about a year and wanted something that would motivate me to start. This video is slow-paced, which I needed at first.  The moves are effective but you probably won't break a sweat if that's what you're after.  The video encourages you to use 5 pound weights and pair with 3 pound weights at certain parts.  You also combine the 5 pound weights, but since mine don't have nice handles like in the video, I just use a 10 pound weight.  This is pure weights and no cardio, so keep that in mind.  I now use this video if I've already done 45-60 minutes of cardio.  It's about 55 minutes but there is a 25 minute version.  Some of the cues are very off, which, even after doing this video a number of times, I still trip up.  For example, she does one move where you go to the right, then the left, and then repeat.  She doesn't tell you to repeat until after, and even another instructor in the background trips up because of it.  That said, if you haven't exercised in a while or you're looking for some slower-paced toning, this is a nice video.",1297728000,,1251,4.299145299145299
3070621,3,B0011Z5NLY,"This is another one I'm very glad I checked out from the library first. It's an okay strength workout, but I've generally found the Firm workouts to be tougher on the upper body stuff. Also, I've heard people talk  about various Firm instructors having bad cuing skills, but this is the first time I've noticed it. She confused me more than once, though I'm sure if I do it again, I'll get it. As far as the actual workout goes, the only real positive for me was the variation in moves for upper body. There were some I haven't done before, and I was definitely feeling it the next day or so. I am always a little annoyed by the continuous smiles on the backup exercisers, and this was no exception. I just don't think it's natural. But the modifier was the very worst I've seen with her head bobbing and pageant queen hand movements. I focused on Allie Del Rio since she's my favorite. All in all, if you're looking for some good upper body strength training to start out with, you'll probably find what you're looking for here. It just isn't for me.",1297728000,3,1051,4.38974358974359
3070622,5,B0011Z5NLY,"I exercise 5-6 days a week and have a ridiculous number of workout DVD's to stave off boredom.  Among my collection are many, many Firm routines, ranging from the early days of Volumes 1-6, through the Fanny Lifter series, the TransFirmation era up to more recent workouts.

I've done this workout 4 times and it's one of my all time favorites.  This workout does not have cardio, but focuses solely on sculpting.  I very much enjoyed the slower pacing that is interspersed with stretching - and I believe my body did as well.  The workout has some consistency in the routines that allow you to anticipate what will come next.  There are some minor cueing flaws, such as one that failed to cue you to shift from performing 1 repetition to 3 that trips up Allie as well, so I didn't feel so bad - and a tendency to tell you ""last one"" AFTER you'd performed it instead of AS you perform it.  But that's all small stuff and doesn't detract from the quality of the workout.

All the exercises use medium weight throughout the whole workout (except for beginners, of course) and I started out with a 5 pound weight.  That seemed a bit easy, so I used a 6 pound weigh the next time.  The third time I used the workout, I used an 8 pound weight and that proved to be just right for now - and I broke a good sweat. Detractors have said the routine didn't get their heart rate up high enough, but I'm not looking for a sculpting workout to raise my heart rate - that's what cardio workouts are for.  The pacing of this workout gives you enough time to position yourself well and use good form.

The first time I used the DVD, I did the 25 minute Express Workout to familiarize myself with the content.  If memory serves me correctly, it was a good, quick workout that worked the whole body, but cut much of the core routine and some of the dips and lunges.  I liked what I saw enough to perform the entire 45 minute workout the next times.  Still, it's nice to know if time is short, you have a safe alternative.

This may not be the most intense Firm DVD ever, but I feel it's one of their best - it gives a nice, controlled, well paced and safe workout for the entire body.  Intensity can be increased by using heavier weights.  If you've been wanting to try increase your weights, this would be an excellent routine to work your way up with!",1297555200,17,2335,4.304347826086956

3070625,4,B0011Z5NLY,"This is a much slower, concentrated workout with weights.
It's not a bad video as some reviewers are saying, it's just a DIFFERENT type of workout.
It's more focused on moderately heavy concentrated compound lifts, rather then cardio splits with light weights.

It's not as fun as the other more fast paced firm videos with cardio segments, but it is still just as effective in it's own way.

Annie Lee is all about form, and you will see that in this video. I appreciate her effort to remind us of how important it is to exercise safely for LONG TERM results.

Since the movements are slower, you can really heavy up the weights on some of the exercises, as long as you maintain perfect form.",1288051200,4,693,4.528
3070626,5,B0011Z5NLY,"I've recently added 4 FIRM DVD's to my collection and this is the latest...and, by far, my favorite. I was looking for a no-nonsense, easy-to-follow routine and this DVD delivers with not just one but two workouts. They both do a fabulous job targeting the entire body, especially the lower body and-- more than other types of DVD's-- the entire upper and lower back.
What I particularly like about these workouts is that there is no cardio, which keeps my finger off the fast forward button. Everyone has their preferences, and mine is to use my time sculpting. And even better, the movements are simple with long enough sets that there is an extremely low learning curve. Love that! For the most part, they do not switch up after two reps and jump around like some of the other FIRM DVD's do, so you can be following right along from the get-go. This subsequently allows for more concentration on form, which is extremely important.
There are two workouts on this DVD. The shorter, 25-minute workout is perfect for days when there isn't much time or energy levels are low. I thought this would be the one I'd be doing most, until I tried the longer 45-minute workout and found there are lots of really beneficial additional exercises to make up the extra 20 minutes. I can see now I will MAKE time to do the longer workout as often as possible!
I also really liked the instructor. Her manner and tone of voice were pleasant and she often added some funny comments.
As a rather important aside, I didn't order this from Amazon or a vendor that processes its payments through Amazon. I got what I thought was a great deal from what I thought was a legitimate (online) business, only to find this ""business"" has since been making unauthorized charges on my bank card. So, I wound up paying three times as much for the DVD and having to cancel my bank card. What a (scary) hassle!
The silver lining is, I do really like the DVD. Whether I'm looking for a quick toning fix or a longer workout to push it to the max, this is my new ""go to"" workout DVD.",1282608000,4,2048,4.478609625668449

Instead of selling this DVD, I decided to keep it and try it one last time before I came to a final conclusion. I took some notes, reread them this morning and opted for this over any Firm workout. The only 2 changes I made were, a) Using 8s for my ""mediums"" and b) skipping Annie's warm up for another 5 minute one of my choice. Those 2 changes made all the difference in the world for me!

This is a solid 45 minute (approx 47 min) workout that covers all of the muscle groups, large and small completely. I find that this DVD gives some extra attention to the shoulders, back, and abs. There is plenty of standing core in this DVD which helps to break up the usual floor routines for abs. 95% of the time, you will use your medium weights and never just your lights. There are also various exercises where you will combine both of your mediums in one hand, which I found to be challenging as I was gripping 2-8 lb dumbbells. These movements will focus on the upper-mid back. Annie does not do a lot of reps in this workout which is PERFECT for heaving up! I made the mistake the first time using the weight increments that I would for other Firm Pinks and you will need to increase your ranges for this DVD regardless of your fitness level. If not, you will not be challenged and this workout will most likely feel pointless for muscle and strength gains. Aside from dumbbells, I'd recommend having a mat for floor work. With a bad shoulder and knee, adding the weights, even using the 16 lbs didn't hurt me, so I say this is more than safe and I'm known for babying that shoulder! Again, the slower pace and lower reps are what makes the difference here.

This workout was one that drenched me in sweat and had me breathing very hard at times! I'm sure lifting 16 lbs with one arm helped that! You'll do a combination of compound (multi-muscle) exercises along with isolations (single muscle focus; ie Bicep Curls). Often she pairs both types into one exercise for example: Alternating lunges with bicep curls, doing them seperate then both together. Several combinations like this are in the workout including squats, bridges, and various moves for abs and upper body. It's a workout that won't get your heart rate as high as cardio or aerobic weight training DVDs by the Firm (cardio and weights together), but it really gets it up there compared to other strength-only DVDs that you'll find from other instructors. You'll be at an Anaerobic Rate several times which is a high calorie burning range! I also think it's one of the most well rounded strength-only DVDs on the market and at 47 minutes from start to finish, you just can't beat that! For those tight on time, there is a 25 minute premix option which I have yet to do. Give this workout at least 2-3 trys before tossing it to the side. It'll take some time and notes to really understand what your perfect weight selection is and once you do, this workout has a Night and Day difference!

2 hours post workout and my biceps are still nice and warm which is one of the hardest muscle groups on my body to get ""fired"" up! This DVD is one that will allow me go heavier not just with this workout, but also increase faster with other Firm Workouts both Pink and BSS Systems. It's an asset to anyone's collection that wants a solid, effective, and fast strength workout. This DVD is a keeper in my book! Whereas 3 months ago, I was ready to chuck it!

The only cons that I can list are that there are a couple of times she flubs her words and the warmup is in my opinion, boring. Which is the only reason I am deducting a star; I'd say it's closer to a 4.5 Star DVD.

Edit: 1 Day Post Workout and I am feeling the effects in places I didn't expect! I have read on other sites that this workout is a silent burner and I do agree! While all muscles got a great workout, I didn't expect to feel it in the chest, inner thighs, and butt. I expect to feel it in the back and shoulders and while I do, not nearly as much as the other muscles. I've been using the TransFirmer and Fanny Lifter DVDs lately, so the lower body burn is a real surprise. I woke up sore and stiff and now I am positive that this WILL remain in my regular rotation!",1272153600,19,4485,4.284198113207547
3070633,4,B0011Z5NLY,"I have been working out to this video 2 times a week since late Feb. I really like it. I can definitely feel the change in my legs from so many lunges, dips, & squats! I have been working out with weights, aerobics videos and classes, and have been a walker all for about 20 years off & on. I don't think this video is too easy for an experienced exerciser; maybe for someone who runs a lot and is a true bodybuilder. It has a good pace, maybe a tad too slow, and I really work up a sweat. I like that the instructor Annie gives you tips on your form and clear instructions on how to do the moves. I also like that she incorporates the ab work throughout the entire workout and not just a really long intense ab workout at the end. I do wish there was more arm work and some moves for calves. But I just do a few extra moves when I finish the video to get in some more arms moves & some calf work. I recently increased the weight I use and am going to move up to 3 times a week.",1271203200,4,978,3.870646766169154
3070634,5,B0011Z5NLY,"I started using the firm complete set about a month ago. It came with 4 CDs. The first one I did, as per the firm's workout schedule was hi-def scuplt. I found I was kinda rusty, but it wasn't that bad. The other videos in the set are WAY too difficult for me to do at my current fitness level. I need to lose a LOT of weight and get back into shape to boot. Anyway, I gave up on the Firm, seeing as I was too discouraged when I couldn't do the videos.

But then I decided to give it a second shot. I have completed Hi Def Sculpt 4 times this week and feel great. I am feeling more confident and may move onto a new workout next week. One thing helpful to me was the section entitled ""firm moves"". If you are having trouble with moves and keeping up, I'd advise that you just use that section until you have them down. That's what I plan to do with the next video ""Cardio Overdrive"". I also found a beginner yoga by the firm that looks good for me and plan to buy that in the near future.

I like the host, Annie,  she has a wonderful smile that she turns on you right as you need a boost. She is also very encouraging for someone like me who appreciated that.

I was able to do the entire work-out all the way through with 3 lb weights, and felt the benefits of returning to exericise very quickly.  That's just the kind of encouragement I need to stick with a new exercise program.  It has the usual Firm exercise system that combines upper and lower body, bringing up the heart rate while toning muscles.

Annie Lee is in another category.  To begin with, I believe she is the only Firm instructor who is an exercise physiologist.  Nothing fancy with her footwork, just a comprehensive and challenging but easy to follow workout.  I have no problems following her as her cueing is impeccable.  At the end of the workout, I feel tired but wonderful as though I have worked every muscle in my body.  I would not hesitate to purchase any of her DVDs in the future since I'm certain her down-to-earth quality and expertise as an instructor would render the workout excellent.

After I worked out i felt like i hadn't really done anything but then later in the day - I started feeling sore!  Definitely will do this one again and up the weights.

3070640,4,B0011Z5NLY,"I found a dvd set of firm videos at a yard sale and decided to give it a try. Before having two complicated pregnancies I was a very athletic person. Currently, I could stand to lose about 30 pounds. I tried the Cardio Blast dvd and got very discouraged. I am coordinated, but with my extra weight the speed and moves were a little more than I felt comfortable trying. You have to remember if you over do and hurt yourself you can't progress. I doubt I would have stuck with it if I had only had the Cardio Blast dvd. I decided to go to Annie's Hi-Def Sculpt dvd and give it a try. I felt results in less than ten days. I am finding my stomach again and my legs are becoming strong and solid. I know I am losing inches. I am down a pants size and my bras fit much better. It has actually elevated my breasts (crazy, but true). I have been at it for over a month (I do it everyday if at all possible). I think I could do the Cardio Blast much better if I tried it today. My balance is much better and my muscles are strong. Thank you Annie for a video that beginners can do and build confidence with. I feel that there are plenty of advanced videos out there, but not as many good ones for the people that are not already fit. This video is worth the money!",1239235200,3,1256,4.00796812749004
3070641,4,B0011Z5NLY,I just got this yesterday and loved it! I agree that instructor Annie Lee does seem a little nervous and has some cue mistakes but as an overall workout it was great. They take the time to stretch after major muscle groups are worked and I think that will help to decrease soreness.

There is no cardio, but you should be working that into your weekly routine anyway, so I didn't think that mattered.  Annie is a great instructor and very professional.

I workout 4-5 times with videos a week and then add treadmill or other exercise here and there.  I am 61 and working out regular has been a part of my life for over 20 years.  Anyway this workout is gentle to say the least and is good to loosen up if you feel stiff or tight.  I didn't even work up a sweat.  But I will say it touches every muscle just about and works all parts of the body so is a good beginning sculpting routine if you haven't worked out much.  The earlier sculpting videos put out by the Firm are much tougher than this as well as some of the later combo vidoes - try Dangerous Curves Ahead or Total Body Time Crunch, Burn & Shape, Super Charged Sculpting or Total Sclupt Plus Abs.  Usually in the AM I like to use the combo videos that do both aerobics and sculpting in spirts - the Firm has a lot of those both old and new.

3070648,5,B0011Z5NLY,"The thing with being very overweight and trying to do these videos is that sometimes it's hard to do the exercises as fast as the instructors.  I can do dips and lunges just fine, but by the time I get my leg forward -- with good form -- to lunge, they're already bringing their other foot forward.  This DVD takes care of all that.  It goes at a slow pace, but not too slow as not to get your heart rate up.  You're doing lunges at a slow rate but you're also doing weight presses over your head so yeah, you'll sweat.

She starts out advising you to have light and medium weights by your side, but through the whole thing you only use one set of weights.  So I guess you can decide which ones you want to use in the beginning.  The instructor seems a little nervous and misses a couple cues but once you do this DVD a couple times, you'll get past it.  In fact it's endearing.

The only thing I miss in this video is the many reminders to keep your abs in; I like it when instructors constantly remind you of what your form should look like.  For example, she reminds us to ""lead with your elbow"" for a couple of the exercises but I think more could have been done. One instructor from another DVD says that the plies should feel like your back is sliding up and down a wall.  Things like that.

All in all, the best all-over toning workout I've ever used.",1227052800,5,1358,4.141221374045801

3070675,5,B0011Z5NLY,"I was convinced I hated the FIRM workouts because the later versions are difficult to do unless you already have learned the moves because they don't explain them during cueing...they just jump in.
I came upon this video simply because I ordred a set of the weights and it came with it (great weights for cardio workouts by the way!)
It's an excellent sculpting video...I burned more calories according to my heart rate monitor as I do in my hard cardio workouts! (Granted it was a bit longer, but it's difficult for sculpting videos to do that...and I didn't even finish the total workout. I stopped after 30 minutes due to time restraints)
The moves were easy to do and the music really plays a part in getting you moving to the right beat. A real energizer. Too, there were so many varied moves that you work all muscles well, and without boredom.
I will say that I agree with the reviewer that said it was odd that Annie would say ""okay, last one!"" and then put down her weights...typically that cue goes to tell the viewer that this will be their last rep.

That being said Annie Lee is terrible!  She seems very sweet and well meaning but just a bad cuer!  She doesn't tell you whats coming up (eg which foot leads off, when to hold the move, when to go to 3 repetitions instead of 1, etc) She says ""last one"" AFTER the last one.  Her words are generally confusing and unclear.  I could go on and on but the gist is that you feel like she is just someone in the class, definitely not the leader.  It feels like she expects you to already know the routine.  I have done it several times so far so I am getting very familiar with the routine so her cuing mistakes are mainly an annoyance for me at this point, but it is extremely annoying.  I will continue to do this because of the great moves, at least until I find a workout that is just as good with a better instructor.",1216944000,12,1169,4.119469026548672

Sometimes you'll work one muscle alone, and other times, you are working multiple body parts in one go.  You begin with one move and then incorporate add on moves to include more body parts.  This is what's going to help you maximise the fat burning and lose weight.

3305067,5,B0011Z5NLY,"This is one of the Pink Fims, and the first to be led by Annie Lee, who has appeared as a background for other Firm workouts.  As mentioned in another review, I have tried quite a few of the Pink Firms and simply don't care that much for most of them.  The pace is either too fast for me in order to lift a decent amount of weight or they are trying to do too many moves at once.  Lunging, then adding a bicep curl, then let's add a leg lift.  As a result I find myself tripping all over the place or staring at the TV in frustration.

Hi-Def Sculpt is a nice workout, the pace is slower so that you can lift heavier for some exercises.  There are other compound exercises included, but it's kept reasonably simple instead of four different moves going on at the same time.  This routine is all sculpting, there is no cardio at all.  There are also stretches sprinkled throughout the workout.  For those with knee issues, there are a lot of lunges.  I find that I will do them either stationary/static or reverse lunges.  I steer clear from forward lunges, you will see some here but it's very simple to do reverse lunges instead.  I should also note that for some of the sets with lunges, you are also doing a compound exercise with a lighter weight.  So while it might seem you are doing endless lunges, not all of them are with heavier weights which helps.

I thought Annie did a nice job leading the overall, she seemed a little nervous and the cueing isn't the best.  But after you do this workout a few times you will know what is coming.  Annie also has a very admirable physique, I found myself staring at her arms for most of the workout.

Along from Total Body Toner and Get Chisel'd, these are the only Pink Firms that I have enjoyed.  I find the slower pace is suitable and geared towards older people like myself.  Overall, I give this workout 4 and a half stars.",1451692800,,1876,4.278409090909091

Annie (the instructor) does a good job of explaining moves and allowing enough time to transition from move to move. Some of the other firm videos go so quickly from move to move that you lose good workout time figuring out the particular part of the routine or feel that you are stumbling over yourself.,1435536000,,413,4.2405063291139244
3305072,5,B0011Z5NLY,"I'm not really one to write reviews for things, but I feel as though these workouts deserve recognition. My first experience with The Firm was a few years ago when I decided to buy and try the Transfirmer series of workouts. I wasn't necessarily a beginner at that time, but man..those workouts kicked my butt! I then ordered the previous body sculpting series videos to rotate to avoid boredom. I had great success with them but for whatever reason, I ended up joining a local gym and the The Firm videos/step began collecting dust. Fast forward to present, a husband and almost 2 year old daughter later, I decided I needed something that worked for me at home bc trying to coordinate a toddler to your desired gym schedule isn't necessarily the easiest task (not to mention wasting so much gas). It dawned on me to re-order some of The Firm workouts, new and older DVDs; no more driving 30 minutes to the gym for me! Let me tell you, as someone who is by no means a beginner when it comes to fitness, these workouts are no joke. I got a better workout with these DVDs than I did at any class or time on the treadmill/elliptical. I HIGHLY recommend them to anyone who wants to get in shape and get there FAST. I can tell a change in my body already-they promise results in 10 workouts, but you'll see it before then. Trust me. What's also great is that you can make them as easy or as challenging as you desire-increase or decrease your weight. Either way, you'll get a great workout!",1431993600,6,1486,4.427007299270073
3305073,3,B0011Z5NLY,"I don't know what I was thinking buying a tape this long, I don't usually buy them over 40 minutes.  I am also used to the tapes that do cardio and sculpt so I thought this was kind of boring being that it was almost all sculpting.  It was too slow for me so I don't know how often I would add this into my routine and I don't think I felt it as much as some of the other tapes, even though it was a longer workout.",1431561600,,415,3.7045454545454546

3305087,3,B0011Z5NLY,"If you're experienced with working out, then this  will be a nice addition to your library (if you're not, read on and you'll see why I wouldn't recommend this video for beginners). It's a good, solid, sculpting workout. There are no aerobic sets like there are in other The Firm sculpting videos, so if you're looking for a strengthening and toning routine, this one is good. I've been working out with weights for many years and I found this workout to be moderate - it covers all the major muscle groups and some of the exercises are creative where upper and lower body are combined. I broke a sweat and felt like I worked at the conclusion.

The abs segment is fine for maintenance in a pinch, but be aware that you'll want to try other routines if abs are your focus.

Annie misses cues and misspeaks several times in this video. The first time you do the workout, be aware of this and make sure you watch and listen. You'll figure it out. Moreover, sometimes for a lower body set you'll work one side and then the other, and then at other times you will alternate sides. Annie doesn't tell you which to anticipate, so you have to be ready for either.

This workout claims to require a set of light weights and a set of medium weights (it is suggested that beginners use no weights). The medium weights are used for every set, but I found this to be incongruous. For example, whatever you choose for your medium weight will be used for both lat rows and straight arm front raises. A heavy weight is more appropriate for rows, but if you use that same weight for front raises you may strain yourself. I suggest having heavy, medium, and light weights available. Ignore the cue to pick up your medium weights and choose the appropriate weight for the exercise. You'll want a heavy enough weight to challenge the big muscle groups, but lighter weights for other exercises. Of course it takes some experience to make a safe and appropriate choice.",1414800000,3,1948,4.525568181818182

3305117,4,B0011Z5NLY,"I bought this video in a four pack with other Firm workouts - Cardio-Overdrive, Cardio Party, and Hard Core Fusion.  It came with a calendar of how to ease into the program.  I hadn't worked out regularly in about a year and wanted something that would motivate me to start. This video is slow-paced, which I needed at first.  The moves are effective but you probably won't break a sweat if that's what you're after.  The video encourages you to use 5 pound weights and pair with 3 pound weights at certain parts.  You also combine the 5 pound weights, but since mine don't have nice handles like in the video, I just use a 10 pound weight.  This is pure weights and no cardio, so keep that in mind.  I now use this video if I've already done 45-60 minutes of cardio.  It's about 55 minutes but there is a 25 minute version.  Some of the cues are very off, which, even after doing this video a number of times, I still trip up.  For example, she does one move where you go to the right, then the left, and then repeat.  She doesn't tell you to repeat until after, and even another instructor in the background trips up because of it.  That said, if you haven't exercised in a while or you're looking for some slower-paced toning, this is a nice video.",1297728000,,1251,4.299145299145299
3305118,3,B0011Z5NLY,"This is another one I'm very glad I checked out from the library first. It's an okay strength workout, but I've generally found the Firm workouts to be tougher on the upper body stuff. Also, I've heard people talk  about various Firm instructors having bad cuing skills, but this is the first time I've noticed it. She confused me more than once, though I'm sure if I do it again, I'll get it. As far as the actual workout goes, the only real positive for me was the variation in moves for upper body. There were some I haven't done before, and I was definitely feeling it the next day or so. I am always a little annoyed by the continuous smiles on the backup exercisers, and this was no exception. I just don't think it's natural. But the modifier was the very worst I've seen with her head bobbing and pageant queen hand movements. I focused on Allie Del Rio since she's my favorite. All in all, if you're looking for some good upper body strength training to start out with, you'll probably find what you're looking for here. It just isn't for me.",1297728000,3,1051,4.38974358974359
3305119,5,B0011Z5NLY,"I exercise 5-6 days a week and have a ridiculous number of workout DVD's to stave off boredom.  Among my collection are many, many Firm routines, ranging from the early days of Volumes 1-6, through the Fanny Lifter series, the TransFirmation era up to more recent workouts.

I've done this workout 4 times and it's one of my all time favorites.  This workout does not have cardio, but focuses solely on sculpting.  I very much enjoyed the slower pacing that is interspersed with stretching - and I believe my body did as well.  The workout has some consistency in the routines that allow you to anticipate what will come next.  There are some minor cueing flaws, such as one that failed to cue you to shift from performing 1 repetition to 3 that trips up Allie as well, so I didn't feel so bad - and a tendency to tell you ""last one"" AFTER you'd performed it instead of AS you perform it.  But that's all small stuff and doesn't detract from the quality of the workout.

All the exercises use medium weight throughout the whole workout (except for beginners, of course) and I started out with a 5 pound weight.  That seemed a bit easy, so I used a 6 pound weigh the next time.  The third time I used the workout, I used an 8 pound weight and that proved to be just right for now - and I broke a good sweat. Detractors have said the routine didn't get their heart rate up high enough, but I'm not looking for a sculpting workout to raise my heart rate - that's what cardio workouts are for.  The pacing of this workout gives you enough time to position yourself well and use good form.

The first time I used the DVD, I did the 25 minute Express Workout to familiarize myself with the content.  If memory serves me correctly, it was a good, quick workout that worked the whole body, but cut much of the core routine and some of the dips and lunges.  I liked what I saw enough to perform the entire 45 minute workout the next times.  Still, it's nice to know if time is short, you have a safe alternative.

This may not be the most intense Firm DVD ever, but I feel it's one of their best - it gives a nice, controlled, well paced and safe workout for the entire body.  Intensity can be increased by using heavier weights.  If you've been wanting to try increase your weights, this would be an excellent routine to work your way up with!",1297555200,17,2335,4.304347826086956

3305121,4,B0011Z5NLY,I like this video.  The pace is slow enough to easily be followed and not left in the dust like some other fast paced videos.  I was pretty sore after the first time doing it.

3305122,4,B0011Z5NLY,"This is a much slower, concentrated workout with weights.
It's not a bad video as some reviewers are saying, it's just a DIFFERENT type of workout.
It's more focused on moderately heavy concentrated compound lifts, rather then cardio splits with light weights.

It's not as fun as the other more fast paced firm videos with cardio segments, but it is still just as effective in it's own way.

Annie Lee is all about form, and you will see that in this video. I appreciate her effort to remind us of how important it is to exercise safely for LONG TERM results.

Since the movements are slower, you can really heavy up the weights on some of the exercises, as long as you maintain perfect form.",1288051200,4,693,4.528
3305123,5,B0011Z5NLY,"I've recently added 4 FIRM DVD's to my collection and this is the latest...and, by far, my favorite. I was looking for a no-nonsense, easy-to-follow routine and this DVD delivers with not just one but two workouts. They both do a fabulous job targeting the entire body, especially the lower body and-- more than other types of DVD's-- the entire upper and lower back.
What I particularly like about these workouts is that there is no cardio, which keeps my finger off the fast forward button. Everyone has their preferences, and mine is to use my time sculpting. And even better, the movements are simple with long enough sets that there is an extremely low learning curve. Love that! For the most part, they do not switch up after two reps and jump around like some of the other FIRM DVD's do, so you can be following right along from the get-go. This subsequently allows for more concentration on form, which is extremely important.
There are two workouts on this DVD. The shorter, 25-minute workout is perfect for days when there isn't much time or energy levels are low. I thought this would be the one I'd be doing most, until I tried the longer 45-minute workout and found there are lots of really beneficial additional exercises to make up the extra 20 minutes. I can see now I will MAKE time to do the longer workout as often as possible!
I also really liked the instructor. Her manner and tone of voice were pleasant and she often added some funny comments.
As a rather important aside, I didn't order this from Amazon or a vendor that processes its payments through Amazon. I got what I thought was a great deal from what I thought was a legitimate (online) business, only to find this ""business"" has since been making unauthorized charges on my bank card. So, I wound up paying three times as much for the DVD and having to cancel my bank card. What a (scary) hassle!
The silver lining is, I do really like the DVD. Whether I'm looking for a quick toning fix or a longer workout to push it to the max, this is my new ""go to"" workout DVD.",1282608000,4,2048,4.478609625668449

I started off with 3lb weights, moved to 5lbs weights and just recently moved up to 8lb weights. I defintely saw a difference in my body after the first 10 workouts. I like the instructor though her cueing is off a couple of times. She is not overly peppy, but she does keep you in it which I like.

3305129,4,B0011Z5NLY,"I did this workout for the 2nd time today and I have to say, I liked it a lot more after this morning! When I did this workout for the first time, I found it to be unchallenging, boring, and the warmup was a little dry for my tastes. Let's face it, it had some serious dread factor for me! Instead of selling this DVD, I decided to keep it and try it one last time before I came to a final conclusion. I took some notes, reread them this morning and opted for this over any Firm workout. The only 2 changes I made were, a) Using 8s for my ""mediums"" and b) skipping Annie's warm up for another 5 minute one of my choice. Those 2 changes made all the difference in the world for me!

This is a solid 45 minute (approx 47 min) workout that covers all of the muscle groups, large and small completely. I find that this DVD gives some extra attention to the shoulders, back, and abs. There is plenty of standing core in this DVD which helps to break up the usual floor routines for abs. 95% of the time, you will use your medium weights and never just your lights. There are also various exercises where you will combine both of your mediums in one hand, which I found to be challenging as I was gripping 2-8 lb dumbbells. These movements will focus on the upper-mid back. Annie does not do a lot of reps in this workout which is PERFECT for heaving up! I made the mistake the first time using the weight increments that I would for other Firm Pinks and you will need to increase your ranges for this DVD regardless of your fitness level. If not, you will not be challenged and this workout will most likely feel pointless for muscle and strength gains. Aside from dumbbells, I'd recommend having a mat for floor work. With a bad shoulder and knee, adding the weights, even using the 16 lbs didn't hurt me, so I say this is more than safe and I'm known for babying that shoulder! Again, the slower pace and lower reps are what makes the difference here.

This workout was one that drenched me in sweat and had me breathing very hard at times! I'm sure lifting 16 lbs with one arm helped that! You'll do a combination of compound (multi-muscle) exercises along with isolations (single muscle focus; ie Bicep Curls). Often she pairs both types into one exercise for example: Alternating lunges with bicep curls, doing them seperate then both together. Several combinations like this are in the workout including squats, bridges, and various moves for abs and upper body. It's a workout that won't get your heart rate as high as cardio or aerobic weight training DVDs by the Firm (cardio and weights together), but it really gets it up there compared to other strength-only DVDs that you'll find from other instructors. You'll be at an Anaerobic Rate several times which is a high calorie burning range! I also think it's one of the most well rounded strength-only DVDs on the market and at 47 minutes from start to finish, you just can't beat that! For those tight on time, there is a 25 minute premix option which I have yet to do. Give this workout at least 2-3 trys before tossing it to the side. It'll take some time and notes to really understand what your perfect weight selection is and once you do, this workout has a Night and Day difference!

2 hours post workout and my biceps are still nice and warm which is one of the hardest muscle groups on my body to get ""fired"" up! This DVD is one that will allow me go heavier not just with this workout, but also increase faster with other Firm Workouts both Pink and BSS Systems. It's an asset to anyone's collection that wants a solid, effective, and fast strength workout. This DVD is a keeper in my book! Whereas 3 months ago, I was ready to chuck it!

The only cons that I can list are that there are a couple of times she flubs her words and the warmup is in my opinion, boring. Which is the only reason I am deducting a star; I'd say it's closer to a 4.5 Star DVD.

Edit: 1 Day Post Workout and I am feeling the effects in places I didn't expect! I have read on other sites that this workout is a silent burner and I do agree! While all muscles got a great workout, I didn't expect to feel it in the chest, inner thighs, and butt. I expect to feel it in the back and shoulders and while I do, not nearly as much as the other muscles. I've been using the TransFirmer and Fanny Lifter DVDs lately, so the lower body burn is a real surprise. I woke up sore and stiff and now I am positive that this WILL remain in my regular rotation!",1272153600,19,4485,4.284198113207547
3305130,4,B0011Z5NLY,"I have been working out to this video 2 times a week since late Feb. I really like it. I can definitely feel the change in my legs from so many lunges, dips, & squats! I have been working out with weights, aerobics videos and classes, and have been a walker all for about 20 years off & on. I don't think this video is too easy for an experienced exerciser; maybe for someone who runs a lot and is a true bodybuilder. It has a good pace, maybe a tad too slow, and I really work up a sweat. I like that the instructor Annie gives you tips on your form and clear instructions on how to do the moves. I also like that she incorporates the ab work throughout the entire workout and not just a really long intense ab workout at the end. I do wish there was more arm work and some moves for calves. But I just do a few extra moves when I finish the video to get in some more arms moves & some calf work. I recently increased the weight I use and am going to move up to 3 times a week.",1271203200,4,978,3.870646766169154
3305131,5,B0011Z5NLY,"I started using the firm complete set about a month ago. It came with 4 CDs. The first one I did, as per the firm's workout schedule was hi-def scuplt. I found I was kinda rusty, but it wasn't that bad. The other videos in the set are WAY too difficult for me to do at my current fitness level. I need to lose a LOT of weight and get back into shape to boot. Anyway, I gave up on the Firm, seeing as I was too discouraged when I couldn't do the videos.

But then I decided to give it a second shot. I have completed Hi Def Sculpt 4 times this week and feel great. I am feeling more confident and may move onto a new workout next week. One thing helpful to me was the section entitled ""firm moves"". If you are having trouble with moves and keeping up, I'd advise that you just use that section until you have them down. That's what I plan to do with the next video ""Cardio Overdrive"". I also found a beginner yoga by the firm that looks good for me and plan to buy that in the near future.

I like the host, Annie,  she has a wonderful smile that she turns on you right as you need a boost. She is also very encouraging for someone like me who appreciated that.

I was able to do the entire work-out all the way through with 3 lb weights, and felt the benefits of returning to exericise very quickly.  That's just the kind of encouragement I need to stick with a new exercise program.  It has the usual Firm exercise system that combines upper and lower body, bringing up the heart rate while toning muscles.

Since then I have purchased many of the videos and dvds.
 Some were ok and some were really good. I put this one as one of the really good ones.
  I like the controlled movements and the instructor cues at the right time.
  She seems to know how to make sure you are positioned right.
 I enjoyed her little joke about waving with your hand and not your whole arm. I hope to see Annie Lee do more Dvds in the future.",1242604800,4,478,3.9789473684210526
3305134,5,B0011Z5NLY,"I am not a big fan of The Firm for two reasons;  (1)  sometimes their steps are too intricate and I have a hard time keeping up with the choreography; and (2)  I don't care for the ""remote"" personalities of most of the leaders.  Annie Lee is in another category.  To begin with, I believe she is the only Firm instructor who is an exercise physiologist.  Nothing fancy with her footwork, just a comprehensive and challenging but easy to follow workout.  I have no problems following her as her cueing is impeccable.  At the end of the workout, I feel tired but wonderful as though I have worked every muscle in my body.  I would not hesitate to purchase any of her DVDs in the future since I'm certain her down-to-earth quality and expertise as an instructor would render the workout excellent.

After I worked out i felt like i hadn't really done anything but then later in the day - I started feeling sore!  Definitely will do this one again and up the weights.  This is an ""easier"" workout that will let you work heavy in the weights if you want to  - just beware, you WILL feel it later!

3305137,4,B0011Z5NLY,"I found a dvd set of firm videos at a yard sale and decided to give it a try. Before having two complicated pregnancies I was a very athletic person. Currently, I could stand to lose about 30 pounds. I tried the Cardio Blast dvd and got very discouraged. I am coordinated, but with my extra weight the speed and moves were a little more than I felt comfortable trying. You have to remember if you over do and hurt yourself you can't progress. I doubt I would have stuck with it if I had only had the Cardio Blast dvd. I decided to go to Annie's Hi-Def Sculpt dvd and give it a try. I felt results in less than ten days. I am finding my stomach again and my legs are becoming strong and solid. I know I am losing inches. I am down a pants size and my bras fit much better. It has actually elevated my breasts (crazy, but true). I have been at it for over a month (I do it everyday if at all possible). I think I could do the Cardio Blast much better if I tried it today. My balance is much better and my muscles are strong. Thank you Annie for a video that beginners can do and build confidence with. I feel that there are plenty of advanced videos out there, but not as many good ones for the people that are not already fit. This video is worth the money!",1239235200,3,1256,4.00796812749004
3305138,4,B0011Z5NLY,I just got this yesterday and loved it! I agree that instructor Annie Lee does seem a little nervous and has some cue mistakes but as an overall workout it was great. They take the time to stretch after major muscle groups are worked and I think that will help to decrease soreness. I lost about 20lbs with the Firm about 4 years ago and am hoping that this and a few of their other dvd's will get me back into shape in no time!

I know first hand if done diligently the Firm series can and does produce fast long lasting results. I personally have lost 80+ pounds using them. This DVD is great for body sculpting. There is no high intesity cardio, but studies (and my personal experiences) have shown body sculpting and resistance training are necessary for long term health and strength. I would alternate this workout with walking or another type of cardio activity if your  desire is weightloss. This DVD also has an express workout that is about 25 min.

This is a great one in that it is challenging (if you use the appropriate weights for your level) and it hits all muscle groups.  There is no cardio, but you should be working that into your weekly routine anyway, so I didn't think that mattered.  Annie is a great instructor and very professional.  This is one of the best Firm workouts I've ever used and I own most of them already (even from the ""early days"").",1233273600,,553,4.330097087378641

Annie is a crazy buffed woman (is that even natural?) that definitely seems nervous a few times, but overall does a decent job with cuing.  There's not anything really new in this video but I like that there is no dancing.

I workout 4-5 times with videos a week and then add treadmill or other exercise here and there.  I am 61 and working out regular has been a part of my life for over 20 years.  Anyway this workout is gentle to say the least and is good to loosen up if you feel stiff or tight.  I didn't even work up a sweat.  But I will say it touches every muscle just about and works all parts of the body so is a good beginning sculpting routine if you haven't worked out much.  The earlier sculpting videos put out by the Firm are much tougher than this as well as some of the later combo vidoes - try Dangerous Curves Ahead or Total Body Time Crunch, Burn & Shape, Super Charged Sculpting or Total Sclupt Plus Abs.  Usually in the AM I like to use the combo videos that do both aerobics and sculpting in spirts - the Firm has a lot of those both old and new.  The key is keep challenging yourself and be consistent.  It works.",1231718400,6,1083,3.8863636363636362

Most of the The Firm stuff I don't like anyway, even though some of the newer ones I can tolerate. This instructor is actually pretty nice and not as annoying as some of the others, but the workout is too lame, even with heavier weights.",1230249600,,344,4.149253731343284
3305145,5,B0011Z5NLY,"The thing with being very overweight and trying to do these videos is that sometimes it's hard to do the exercises as fast as the instructors.  I can do dips and lunges just fine, but by the time I get my leg forward -- with good form -- to lunge, they're already bringing their other foot forward.  This DVD takes care of all that.  It goes at a slow pace, but not too slow as not to get your heart rate up.  You're doing lunges at a slow rate but you're also doing weight presses over your head so yeah, you'll sweat.

She starts out advising you to have light and medium weights by your side, but through the whole thing you only use one set of weights.  So I guess you can decide which ones you want to use in the beginning.  The instructor seems a little nervous and misses a couple cues but once you do this DVD a couple times, you'll get past it.  In fact it's endearing.

The only thing I miss in this video is the many reminders to keep your abs in; I like it when instructors constantly remind you of what your form should look like.  For example, she reminds us to ""lead with your elbow"" for a couple of the exercises but I think more could have been done. One instructor from another DVD says that the plies should feel like your back is sliding up and down a wall.  Things like that.

All in all, the best all-over toning workout I've ever used.",1227052800,5,1358,4.141221374045801
3305171,1,B0011Z5NLY,"I have been doing The Firm workouts since 2001 and have loved almost everything they have put out....this workout would fall in the not so great workouts. I found that there were way too many breaks in between sets and found it too easy, even with the increase of weights. It didn't even raise my heart rate that much. If you are just starting out, this workout would be great, for those who are more intermediate or advanced, I would save your money!!!",1226534400,2,453,4.469879518072289
3305172,5,B0011Z5NLY,"I was convinced I hated the FIRM workouts because the later versions are difficult to do unless you already have learned the moves because they don't explain them during cueing...they just jump in.
I came upon this video simply because I ordred a set of the weights and it came with it (great weights for cardio workouts by the way!)
It's an excellent sculpting video...I burned more calories according to my heart rate monitor as I do in my hard cardio workouts! (Granted it was a bit longer, but it's difficult for sculpting videos to do that...and I didn't even finish the total workout. I stopped after 30 minutes due to time restraints)
The moves were easy to do and the music really plays a part in getting you moving to the right beat. A real energizer. Too, there were so many varied moves that you work all muscles well, and without boredom.
I will say that I agree with the reviewer that said it was odd that Annie would say ""okay, last one!"" and then put down her weights...typically that cue goes to tell the viewer that this will be their last rep. But after viewing the dvd once you catch on that you aren't supposed to do one more when she says that!",1224979200,3,1165,4.423255813953489

After those 15 min however, it does pick up.  There are some great ""mid section"" moves which I really like.  Lots of lunges and dips of course.  It is an overall good total body toning workout.  That being said Annie Lee is terrible!  She seems very sweet and well meaning but just a bad cuer!  She doesn't tell you whats coming up (eg which foot leads off, when to hold the move, when to go to 3 repetitions instead of 1, etc) She says ""last one"" AFTER the last one.  Her words are generally confusing and unclear.  I could go on and on but the gist is that you feel like she is just someone in the class, definitely not the leader.  It feels like she expects you to already know the routine.  I have done it several times so far so I am getting very familiar with the routine so her cuing mistakes are mainly an annoyance for me at this point, but it is extremely annoying.  I will continue to do this because of the great moves, at least until I find a workout that is just as good with a better instructor.",1216944000,12,1169,4.119469026548672

As true with all the DVD's you may have to heavy up in some places if you are a experienced exerciser and rotate your videos to get the total benefits.

All in all, this is a really good sculpting routine and works a variety of muscles.  There is not 'cardio' component per se, but some days that is just what I'm looking for.

8243072,5,B0011Z5NLY,"This is my workout DVD by The Firm as Annie as the lead instructor. I have at least a dozen Firm videos but none of them were of Annie leading. I wondered what to expect. The workouts itself are great and I like the fact that she reiterates throughout the video the importance of form. I liked that she would have you put the weights down and stretch after working out for so long. The stretches were very short but at least it was something. It can prevent injury.

She recommend medium and heavy weights. From my observation, I don't remember them switching out to heavier weights. It seems that all the crew worked out with the same dumbbell weights from start to finish. I started out using 5-pounds and I do keep at 8-pound nearby because I do not like combining weights. I prefer to just grab one heavy dumbbell, such as one 8-pound or 10-pound dumbbell to do an exercise with verses holding two of them in one hand to complete an exercise.

 The express workout I believe is only 25 minutes but it targets your ab more with floor exercise; whereas, the 45 minute exercises the abs but not as much as the express workout.

The only con to this video is that her cuing is off and you don't realize it until you see some people are doing different moves.",1513468800,,1258,4.363247863247863
