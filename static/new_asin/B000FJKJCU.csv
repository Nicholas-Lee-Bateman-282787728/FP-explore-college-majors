8123638,1,B000FJKJCU,"I'm surprised I didn't see this on an old MST3K episode.

The aunt has a weird Linda Fiorentino-esque way of half-smiling ALL THE TIME, no matter whether a normal person would or not.  Mr. Atlas touches his child friend so much that all during the first half of the movie I was half-suspecting this to be a NAMBLA Selection of the Month, so to speak.  The plot is ... tired.  The acting is weird.

And then there is the parade of horrible characters:  the drunk grandfatherly old Irish stablehand guy (really, he drinks in 75% of his screen appearances), the simpering villain who looks uncannily like George W. Bush, his mentally-deficient henchman who runs like he's trying out for the role of Jerry Lewis Imitator..... it goes on and on like this.

I can't think of any reason to watch or own this movie except to laugh at it.  I also can't figure out how it got 4 5-star ratings at the time of this review.... Seriously, is there lead in the nation's food?",1213833600,,960,4.477011494252873

For an unknown writer and director to have produced such a wonderful and refreshing film in this day and age was just beautiful.",1174435200,,374,5.114754098360656
8123641,1,B000FJKJCU,"Once, while not enjoying the fruits of my explorations through the one dollar DVD bin at Wal*Mart, I thought to myself that there is very little that is less endurable than a comedy film that fails at being funny.  It turns out that the sliver of awfulness that is worse is a bad kid's movie.

There's something about a uninspired children's film that causes everyone involved to forget everything they learned in film school.  The writing becomes lazy.  The actors go completely over the top.  The director relies on gimmicks.  I presume that people involved with the production assume that children don't know the difference between good movie-making and bad, and therefore simply do whatever comes easiest and hope no one in the target audience notices.

The truth, of course, is that naturally children know when something is good or bad.  They may not be able to articulate it, but they are fully aware of when a piece of entertainment is causing them to yawn, shift uncomfortably in their chairs, or simply become violently ill due to its complete awfulness.

This particular piece of nonsense -- MR ATLAS -- posits that the Atlas of Greek mythology (you'll remember him as the Titan who holds the weight of the world on his shoulder) has been trapped in a cave in Utah for these past millennia.  Released from his bonds by a supposedly precocious ten-year-old boy (Danny), he vows to serve this child as his servant, teaching this youngster about, um, life stuff, while uncomfortably flirting with the kid's hot aunt.

Now the funny thing is that I imagine anyone reading this won't have actually seen this film.  And yet you probably know exactly how this plot (what there is of it) is going to unfold.

Atlas will be introduced to the modern world.  He'll complain about how bad the air smells nowadays.  He'll be dumbfounded by cars.  He'll talk in flowery language about his chick who lives in the heavens.

There's just one thing missing, you say: the bad guy.  The film needs some kind of smarmy villain.  Not an overly powerful super-villain.  Just someone greedy and self-serving, someone who's after money for money's sake, and who doesn't have any real motivation to be in the film except to hate the kid and serve as a foil to Atlas.

Enter Timothy Bottoms.  He's not just the villain, he's also the sole reason I bought this damn DVD (I usually draw the line on this side of purchasing kid's movies, no matter how cheap they are).  Bottoms is notable for having played President George W. Bush in the short lived Trey Parker and Matt Stone Comedy Central sitcom, ""That's My Bush!"".  Here, Bottoms is playing an evil, manipulative businessman, only interested in using people to obtain the natural resources on their property, and with an unfortunate tendency to wave guns around and shoot innocents.  That's right; the man famous for playing George Bush is here portraying a man exactly like Dick Cheney.  (And for anyone keeping track at home, Bottoms' henchman is a dumb, slow, unintelligent, amiable dope who has a habit of repeating exactly what Bottoms has just said.  Make of that what you will.)

I'll discuss the plot now, only out of a sense of obligation rather than the joy I would otherwise experience from introducing people to something new.  Actually, I think I accidentally described most of the plot already.  Danny is a typical bullied, preyed-upon  ten-year-old being raised by his aunt after the clichd death of his parents.  The only major figures in his life are his wealthy aunt (nice, but gullible), his aunt's boyfriend (Timothy Bottoms), and the stereotypical drunken Irishman who tends to the aunt's ranch and dispenses recycled and uninspired stories about local hidden treasure.

Danny fancies himself as an explorer (his parents were archaeologists) and goes off in search of hidden treasure.  His quest brings him to a hole in the ground.  His encounter with this geographic feature is to do exactly what movie heroes have done for decades before him.  He falls into it.  All is not lost though (we're less than fifteen minutes into the film at this point).  He accidentally releases Atlas from his millennia-long sleep, which promptly puts the audience into a slumber of a similar duration. (Though in a genuinely nice nod to the original myths, apples made of gold are strewn throughout Atlas' cave).

From here on out, the plot takes the expected aforementioned ""twists"".  Evil boyfriend tries to trick the aunt into signing away the rights to the land containing the golden apples; dumb Atlas gets a  haircut and tries to figure out how underpants work.  A fact which may only amuse me is that the actor/model playing Atlas is named in the credits only as ""Diederik"".  It's rare to find a person with only one name who can act, and if you're looking for one here, you can keep searching.

Perhaps I am being unfair to this movie; after all I am not a younger person and clearly this movie wouldn't be aimed at me.  However, I am confident that children would have better taste than to enjoy this movie.  Perhaps one must be extremely young, say, still residing in a womb to extract pleasure from MR ATLAS.  Or maybe by ""younger"", the filmmakers were aiming at ""younger"" on an evolutionary scale.  There may indeed be a group of dull monkeys out there, huddled around their DVD players and requesting to watch again ""The one with big, smart Mr. Atlas!  Ooo oooo oooooo!""",1160956800,,5423,4.798274002157497
8123642,1,B000FJKJCU,"""Mister Atlas""

A review by Romulus Crawley, Nebraskan Desolate Times (Copyright 2002)

Every so often, a long-neglected film is finally released on DVD, and what for some releases would be a mere event becomes an Occasion. Such is the case with ""Mister Atlas,"" a 1997 gem which made a significant splash in the ocean of popular audiences, who saw its value, but which then promptly sank beneath the overbearing tide of the elitist film reviewing industry, which, at the time, just didn't get it.

The plot of ""Mister Atlas"" centers on Danny, a lonely, pre-adolescent boy who encounters the Greek god, Atlas, in an abandoned gold mine. Said mine is on the property of the boy's aunt, who has taken care of him since his parents were killed in an archeological dig. Danny lives with this kind yet romantically-challenged aunt and her boyfriend, who is scheming to sell her property for his personal profit.

As the DVD packaging points out, conveying an unadulterated sense of family values is at the center of the film's purpose. ""Mister Atlas"" can be viewed on a number of levels, but clearly wants first and foremost to be a family picture. In this regard, it succeeds splendidly. For instance, the aunt's semi-abusive, shallow relationship with her live-in-boyfriend (whom, it is implied, she met on a one-night-stand), including his fondling of her posterior, as seen from Danny's point of view, is handled with taste and good humor. Thus, ""Mister Atlas"" is a family movie in the truest sense of the term. The tag  line, ""Mister Atlas: Legend...Hero...Friend,"" also reflects the film's place within that subgenre. Nonetheless, the filmmakers were not satisfied to simply conform ""Mister Atlas"" to tried-but-true generic conventions.

Prior to the appearance of Atlas, Danny's closest male friend has been the lovable drunk Irishman and farmhand, Gus. Even more so than this relationship, however, which is itself fully fleshed out with delicacy and subtlety, the friendship that develops between Atlas and Danny is handled with a depth and rigor rarely seen in contemporary mainstream cinema. One endearing and utterly non-disturbing scene in particular, in which Danny hoses down a naked, glistening Atlas (the god's frontal is tastefully hidden behind a strip of farm fencing), is a touchstone example of the complex values the film emphasizes: loyalty, innocent man-boy intimacy, friends helping friends. That the film doesn't shy away from such moments is a testament to its sincerity and depth. A similar, albeit more understated moment, finds Danny walking down a dirt road with the nearly-naked, sweaty Atlas, a complete stranger to everyone in town. A police car pulls up, but rather than the third-degree scene one would expect from an interaction between law enforcement officials and a half-naked, strange man seen walking down a desolate road with a twelve-year-old child, the interaction is instead characterized by trust, along with an absolute faith in the motives of men wearing loincloths. Refreshing, to say the least, in these days of cinematic cynicism.

The hosing-down-the-Greek scene, and the fact that the police officers do not fall prey to the stereotypes associated with ancient Greeks and young boys, reflects another of the film's positive attributes; namely that ""Mister Atlas"" daringly plays with, but does not buy into, ethnic stereotypes (e.g., whiskey-swilling Irish farmhands; Greeks). These moments are a tribute to the film's courage, honesty, and social-progressiveness. Yet, scriptwriter Elaine Chekich and director Karen Arbeeny are not heavy-handed in their approach to these complex and potentially controversial elements. At its heart, ""Mister Atlas"" remains a family entertainment movie.

Nonetheless, Chekich and Arbeeny do indeed tackle complex ideas even as they craft a deft family-oriented dramedy. Atlas, the epitome of mature maleness, as juxtaposed with the pre-adolescent boy, represents what the boy can become. But even as he beckons the future, Atlas also embodies the past, both in terms of what has been lost and what has been inherited. As part of this thematic project, the film deconstructs one of the tacit claims made by (post-)(post-)modernity, and reveals something that should be obvious, but which our (post-)(post-)modern society so often forgets: that modernity is built upon the past. The ancient Greek god's struggle with technology (light switches, pasta) is sublime. Atlas, representing innocence and other values that cinema and society often treat as being ""outmoded,"" erupts from the past--literally emerges from a ""gold mine"" of ancient (but still crucially relevant) wisdom. Mister Atlas, film and character both, pleads, If only modern society would set aside its shallow sophistication and work the mine of its past roots! Man / child, past / future, old ways / modern ways, ancient wisdom / contemporary shallowness: ""Mister Atlas"" quickly and efficiently establishes these supposed dichotomies in the first 15 minutes of the film, but then masterfully deconstructs their allegedly oppositional relationships. Ultimately, the film reveals the falsity and cynicism behind society's insistence upon such oppositions, but it does so with subtlety, in a manner which leaves the family pic intact.

(Note that as a bonus, Digiview Entertainment's deluxe DVD release of ""Mister Atlas"" includes special features such as English, Standard Full Frame, Approx. 82 Min., Color, Stereo Sound, and Interactive Menus.)

It is without a doubt the greatest piece of cinematography ever created.  Mister Atlas: Legend...Hero...Friend... contains some of the most blindingly brilliant acting you will ever witness.  It is like looking God himself in the face and seeing him smiling back at you!  If you have not yet purchased or viewed this film, you have not lived your life to its fullest extent and you have done yourself a disservice.  Go buy it and watch it THIS INSTANT!",1155859200,5,590,4.571428571428571
8123644,4,B000FJKJCU,"Picked this up at Walmart for a dollar (a sucker for all things greek-myth and/or cheesy).  This movie surprised me, I thought it would be a lot campier with alot worse acting and production values.  Mind you, it is still a sortof made for tv type film and has is moments of slight cringing.  However, it does have alot of things going for it, the plot is well constructed, the pacing is alot better than many movies of its ilk, it only got boring in a few places, the acting is alot better than I was expecting--the characters are believable (except maybe Philip who is a bit of a stock vilain, his brother on the other hand is a very interesting character)  The music was really good.

Inspite of what the back of the box and the little summary says, Danny's Aunt is the femme of the plot (As both of his parents are dead.)

This is a pretty sweet story.  Danny is a bit of an outcast (having had to move due to his parents' death) and stumbles upon Atlas.  Freeing Atlas from a curse (put on him by Medusa...okay bending of the myths a bit here) Atlas becomes his slave (in one hooooorrrible wig) and his friend.  The usual odd man about town routine is done, but with a few different twists than I have normally seen. Def. a good family film, and worth a dollar.",1154563200,3,1266,4.285714285714286
