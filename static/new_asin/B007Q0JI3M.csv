I don't want to give away too much info. It is a very helpful DVD about bulimia nervosa.",1335744000,7,255,4.333333333333333
5104694,5,B007Q0JI3M,"Very descriptive eating disorder movie of a woman suffering from bulimia. It is a 1980's movie, so it is a little bit cheesy. But the portraial of the movie was very good. Merideth Baxter-Birnery played this role very well.",1406764800,,223,4.743589743589744
5104695,5,B007Q0JI3M,Good movie,1406246400,,10,4.5
5104696,5,B007Q0JI3M,A terrific look into what it is like to suffer from this type of eating disorder.  The only thing I wish they had done was gone further into the relationship between Kate and her mother.,1400803200,,186,4.314285714285714

5104698,4,B007Q0JI3M,"FAMILY TIES Meredith Baxter plays the wife who seems to have everything in this made-for-TV-movie, which illuminates the problem of bulimia.

In fitness-obsessed Southern California, Kate Stark struggles to hide her eating disorder, characterized by a psychological need to binge eat and purge, from her husband (Ben Masters), best friend (Shari Belafonte), and everyone around her who could help her fight this life-threatening illness.

When finally confronted by the seriousness of her situation, Kate encounters the caring Dr. Resnick (Ed Asner), and patients with similar issues (played by Tracy Nelson and Mackenzie Phillips), who help her to acknowledge and accept her problem... the first step to healing. Newly remastered.",1391040000,2,731,5.697247706422019
5104699,5,B007Q0JI3M,"This one is a classic. Meredith Baxter Birney plays a Malibu housewife who is also a closet bulimic. Vintage 1980's made for TV, so much better than the new movies that Lifetime produces. Highly entertaining!",1369180800,15,208,4.9714285714285715
5104700,5,B007Q0JI3M,"I had remembered seeing this movie on TV when I was in college back in the mid 1980 and felt like it was good at showing the emotional feelings that go along with the disorder.  I thought that Meredith Baxter did an excellent job making bulimia true to what it is, and what can happen if you keep purging.  It would be a good movie for a parent who has a young girl or teenager so they know what to look for.",1368748800,,408,3.9634146341463414

5104702,3,B007Q0JI3M,"I can not fault the actors in this film.  The screenplay is almost by the numbers.  The impact this film makes is not the one the producers were hoping for.

IF your looking for a film dealing with eating disorders then seek out ""The Best Little Girl in the World"".",1364256000,2,265,4.26
5104703,5,B007Q0JI3M,"I haven't seen this in years, but I have seen it many times.  MBB gives an outstanding performance.  This movie is well written and acted.  I highly recommend it.  I look forward to watching it again on DVD!",1336176000,6,207,4.368421052631579

8520943,5,B007Q0JI3M,"One thing I like about this movie is that it doesn't pull any punches.  Bulimia is disgusting as well as very dangerous and they put it right out there in this film.  One thing I wish they had made more plain is that the reason bulimics binge is that after all that purging the body is so starved for nutrients that it acts almost on it's own just grabbing and grabbing for food.  Then the person is bloated and disgusted, they vomit and the whole things starts all over again.  The film does make pretty plain that if the person we crave praise from when we are children withholds that praise and makes us feel inadequate then the desire to be perfect is set up very early in life. This film does for bulimia what other films have done for anorexia nervosa. The main message is that eating disorders kill.  I think Kate should have been much thinner in the movie and I think Shari Belafonte should not have been cast as she just isn't an actress but it was a very good movie.  I recommend it.",1407974400,2,993,4.283422459893048
