612389,5,6303213707,"Big fan of Lou Diamond Phillips. Also enjoyed Kate Vernon, daughter of John Vernon, star of many teen movies of the 80's.",1359158400,2,121,4.545454545454546
612390,1,6303213707,"Lou Diamond Phillips cowrote and directed this ""erotic thriller"" which wants to be 9  Weeks, and LDP's self-casting as a womaniser, providing himself with a full frontal nudity shot partially obscured by opaque glass in a shower stall, seems the ultimate in conceit. 9  Weeks was bearable because of the presence of Kim Basinger, and here LDP casts a Basinger-look alike in Kate Vernon, but Vernon has none of Basinger's natural appeal, even when dressed in Donna Karan. As a psycho-analyst with a best seller entitled Guilty Pleasures, her own radio talk back show, and a private practice, Vernon is a success waiting to be de-pedestalled. So LDP takes the cue from her radio theme tune Sexual Healing and enscribes ""I want you"" in the copy of her book he shows her at a signing. As we have seen that Vernon has a secret uninhibited sex life, she soon jumps at LDP's advances, and they engage in risky sex - at a party, at a stranger's home, in the open. Vernon psychoanalyses LDP as a ""hustler"" yet still continues to see him, so when he demonstrates his ""career criminal"" behaviour by blackmailing her after a lesbian sex romp, the playfulness turns nasty. The problem that LDP never overcomes with this treatment is that he and Vernon are equally unsympathetic. Naturally we dislike him when he tells her things like he can ""see right into your soul"" but he also tries to hedge his bets by having himself harassed by mob thugs from his past, and Vernon is pushy about her own sexiness - she's far more attractive towards the end when she's not trying to be, and in one scene is styled to resemble Rita Hayworth in Gilda. The screenplay cowritten with Kurt Voss features 2 unintentional laughs with Vernon's ""you need serious counselling"" to LDP, Vernon's manager to Vernon ""He's blackmailing you and he doesn't want your money?!"", and the idea that one of Vernon's patients is a mob boss because of a guilt complex. What is inexplicable is the furore about the lesbian sex scene, which is pretty tame. LDP's pacing is snail like but he comes up with a noteworthy Hitchockian high camera angle as he walks the length of a swimming pool, and some snazzy edits - cross-cutting between his first seduction of Vernon and the playing of a violin, the darkened screen from his black jacket moving from one face to another, and Vernon's writhing in freeze frame to her in a photo shoot.",998265600,12,2382,4.682577565632458
612458,2,6303213707,"I love Lou Diamond Phillips.  However, I did not love this movie.  There really wasn't much of a plot.  The whole thing could have been shown in 20 minutes flat.  So fill in the time with seduction, sex, sex seduction and sex; and there you have it.  Sorry Lou.  Love you in Longmire.",1440892800,,284,4.264150943396227
612459,3,6303213707,"you most definitely have to be a Lou Diamond fan to enjoy this smug, self-satisfied foray into forbidden territory -- namely male nudity -- which probably at the time of filming ( almost 20 years ago ) was considered risque. buy by today's internet standards seem almost puerile. a not-too-bright addition to the suspense/thriller genre. like i said, if you're into Lou Diamond, by all means watch it. it's as good as it gets to see him unclothed, but if that's not a selling point for you,then skip it.",1433980800,,503,4.662921348314606
612460,4,6303213707,"This is a very interesting movie. The story may be a mere fiction, but it depicts a situation that may occur in the life of any of us. I do recommend it to responsible adults.",1426118400,,175,4.0285714285714285

612463,4,6303213707,Pretty good movie. It has a lot of twists and turns. Never could quite guess what was going to happen next or who was going to come out ahead. Suspenseful and gripping.,1403222400,,168,4.28125
612464,1,6303213707,I watched it do the to the customer reviews it was awful . I love the actors but it was a terrible story sorry to Lou Diamond Phillips but this movie is not worth watching just like most movies on Prime,1401667200,,202,3.951219512195122
612465,5,6303213707,"You won't get bored with this movie. It will keep you interested.
The curse words served no real purpose other then that the
plot build up was great.",1400544000,,149,4.357142857142857
612466,5,6303213707,Well done rated R - Never thought that Lou Diamond Phillips would play in such a sultry role.  Movie was well done.,1398729600,3,115,4.2272727272727275
612467,2,6303213707,"Lou Diamond Phillips is a good actor, but not a good director. The storyline is also filled with plot holes. Spend your time elsewhere.",1396310400,,135,4.666666666666667

7842156,3,6303213707,"This was ok for an 80's movie.  The acting was a bit wooden, and given the ""soft core"" content, there wasn't that much chemistry between the characters.  It had some elements of classic film noire, but it gave away a bit too much.  On one hand, If the director(s) had left a little more to the imagination it would have been more interesting.  On the other hand the story doesn't explain enough.  The main character's motivation for revenge was a bit questionable.  He did three years in jail so a dangerous gangster wouldn't kill him; that should be the end of the story.

Overall the movie is visually pleasing and the ending seems to resolve the issues, if a bit ""fantastically""--they glibbly depart the scene of a double homicide. This movie will give you something to do if your bored while folding clothes.",1455235200,,812,4.636363636363637
