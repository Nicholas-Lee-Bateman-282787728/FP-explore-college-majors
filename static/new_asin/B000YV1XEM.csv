Absolutely no drama and no real fights, just strippers and lesbians flashing their fake boobs. Save your money and watch real sex. Jerry I am soooo shaking my fist at you. Jerry you let me down:(",1268870400,2,329,4.689655172413793
8234139,3,B000YV1XEM,"This could be super.  For me though, there will never be a day in my lifetime from birth to the grave that I want to see any woman over 300 pounds in the buff.  Really could have done without that.  I was hoping for an uncensored romp of common folk, and got a trip to the freakin' zoo.  There are some really great gals too, but when you find a cockroach at the bottom of a milkshake, good luck keeping the milkshake down.  I'm a big fan of the TV Show, a fan of Jerry Springer and Steve Wilko, and get a big kick out of the show most of the time.  This DVD though definitely was not quite what I expected.  Adult but really a little bit too silly, even for Jerry Springer.",1242604800,2,674,3.985074626865672

8234141,4,B000YV1XEM,"This second edition of Springer's pay per view series is slightly different in content than the first, although still highly entertaining. It still contains 3 episodes of 55 +/- minutes in length and still features plenty of people fighting and taking their clothes off.

The first section starts with the standard fight and moves into more erotic material. The women all have fetishes of varying degrees and pretty much perform them, sans clothes, on stage for the audience.

The second is filled with more traditional fare and is a show where fans write in with their fantasies.  If you watch Springer on a regular basis, you can imagine what that encompasses.

The third is similar to a standard Springer show, minus the clothing with standard fights, and various other strange behaviors.

It's a wonderful DVD if you like Springer, but if you don't like him you will hate the DVD. It's pretty much as simple as that.",1205107200,8,920,4.834394904458598
