Its a movie to watch when you want warm and cozy!

Its an older movie, so the CGI is older.  Its still well done.

All of the actors are awesome and most were famous.

In my senior years, I relate to the Aunt!  She is an artist and a welcoming person.  She is of the hippie generation and I just love her!

2490777,4,B000E5KJDE,"Twister is a weather related disaster film that is set in Oklahoma in the late 1990s. The plot follows a group of storm chasers over the course of a few days; displaying their day-to-day lifestyle. As the title implies, the movie involves several action-filled tornado hazard scenes with phenomenal special effects for its era. However, though the special effects are intriguing, there are a few exaggerations and miscalculations regarding the twisters. Throughout the movie there are many close scenes involving the impacts of tornadoes. In many of these scenes, the storm chasers are within dangerously close proximity to the twisters and objects can be seen flying out of the funnel; throwing objects such as: debri, semis, cows, and even tractors. However, a tornado goes along its destruction path absorbing materials in its funnel, rather than expelling them. Many of the scenes are inaccurate as debris randomly flies out towards the screen and wind patterns are blowing away from the tornado, rather than inward. In the film the main characters never are injured in their work. However, if storm chasers really stood nearly 50 yards away from a tornado, as depicted in the film, theres a high chance that one may receive some form of injury from flying debris, no matter how strong or weak a tornado may be.
 Another Hollywood take would be the paths of the tornadoes. In a few scenes, tornadoes are displayed as wild and hard to follow. This is true, but tornadoes primarily travel in a lined path, unlike the random flaring and extreme movement of some tornadoes in the film. Tornadoes travel more like a spinning top toy. As the toy spins, it may change direction slightly, but its a much more organized, distinct direction.
 Even though the film has a few exaggerations, there is one thing that is portrayed well. Tornadoes are very powerful, destructive, and dangerous. Throughout the movie, many homes are destroyed in the tornados path without much warning. Currently there is a better system in place for tornado warnings. Before advanced technology was present, many people had little to no time to get to safety before tornadoes hit. Twister has greatly illustrated how much physical and psychological damage that storms can cause to people impacted by them.",1512950400,,2276,5.050531914893617

2490784,5,B000E5KJDE,"My husband grew up in Oklahoma and was seven when he found shelter in a ditch, somewhat like Bill and Jo in the early scene with the bridge. We first started watching this film because it reminded him of home, but not we watch it about once a year because it's just a great film! We watch a lot of disaster films, and this is one of our favs b/c it has good character development, romance, and a lot of excitement. We've spent time in Norman at the severe weather center and have a healthy respect for what folks in Tornado Alley, our family included, face every year.",1509667200,,568,4.268518518518518
2490795,4,B000E5KJDE,"Twister is a fictional natural disaster movie from 1996.  The movie is about a group of storm chasers who decide to research and follow a tornado outbreak across Oklahoma.  The movie was the second highest grossing film of 1996 and its a widely renowned movie.  Though the movie was beautify created in cinematic terms and there really are storm chaser out there, Twister did have some scientifically inaccurate pieces related to weather, climate, and twisters.
The first inaccuracy is when two of the main characters take cover under a bridge during the hit of the first tornado.  The characters also hide in a hanger while a tornado hits a drive-in movie.  Realistically it is not likely that being under a bridge or hangar would protect people from the violent movement of a tornado.  It is always heavily stressed during these natural disasters that people should do their best to be under ground or in a sealed off room to stay safe and anything less than that will be putting you at a great risk.  A structurally sound building is needed to handle extremely high winds and large debris.
Another questionable item is how long the Tornado outbreak lasted.  For the purpose of the two-hour movie the tornados lasted a whole day and night and one more day but in reality tornados don't just continue without stopping for that long.  They typically heat up and cause destruction during the day and possibly night but then take time to begin again.
The tornados also appear to be throwing items from the center when scientifically tornadoes actually suck things in.  The wind blows toward tornados; this warm air is how the tornado continues to turn.
Lastly, the tornado strength was determined before it even hit the ground. When in reality it is not possible to determine the strength of a tornado before it hits the ground and begins destruction.  The damage must be assessed in order to get a rating.",1509408000,,1904,4.792048929663609

2490800,5,B000E5KJDE,"The year is 1996 and the special effects in Twister really made this movie stand out to a nine-year old little boy because I had simply never seen anything quite like it. Even though special effects have gone through generations since then. Twister still stands out because of both the special effects and the acting. I still remember little things from Twister such as lemonade being left on top of the truck or Melissas I gotta go, we got cows. Or perhaps most famously Dustys explanation of the suck zone.

I thought Twister did a lot of revolutionary things for 1996. It combined drama and a surprisingly complex story with a few dashes of comedy with some top of line special effects. A lot of times, it feels like movie studios and directors may excel at one aspect or two, but few have been able to deliver on bringing multiple tools together to create a movie that can pass for a complete movie viewing experience.",1508457600,,922,4.587878787878788

2490816,5,B000E5KJDE,"I miss movies that you could tell what the movie was about just from the title. Mission to Mars was about a mission to Mars. Die Hard was about not dying soft. And Twister? As much as you may want to believe, it's not a biography on Chubby Checkers. Good grief I'm old. It's about tornadoes. As much as one may be inclined to assume, it's not just one massive gnarly black twister chasing after Helen Hunt and Bill Paxton. That would be a pretty lame movie. And Twister is not a lame movie. It's got a terrific cast, hair-raising adventures, Phillip Seymour Hoffman shenanigans, and, of course, twisters. It's a great popcorn flick. The re-mastered sound quality of this movie is life-changing. If you've got or know someone who does have a true home theatre set-up and want to test it, use this movie. The tornado in the beginning will rattle loose the floorboards and your teeth fillings if you have any.",1505174400,,906,4.564417177914111

2490821,5,B000E5KJDE,"I absolutely loved this movie as a child, and still do 21 years later as an adult (wow do I feel old now :( ). Watching it as a child made me want to become a storm chaser when I grew up, low salary be damned, and apparently it sparked an interest in meteorology. So there's an extra, interesting perk regarding this movie. So rewatching this movie as an adult really made the poorly researched scientific aspects blaringly obvious... and I'm not even a scientist. But none of that mattered as the nostalgia factor trumped it all, and really gave me the warm fuzzies as the end credits music rolled on.

I've also heard that they tried to make a bigger and better version of Twister a few years ago with the movie Into the Storm. I watched the trailer for it and although the CGI looked much better than Twister's, it looks as if they made the same mistake as so many producers do this day in age where they use the special effects as the main ""character"" with people sprinkled in as a supporting cast. So producers, if you're reading this, PLEASE chill on the CGI special effects and focus more on the plot instead.",1504483200,,1116,4.391304347826087

2491038,4,B000E5KJDE,"I liked the overall story of this movie, but like most, the love story portion of it is really too bad... that the man was still technically married, to a woman he obviously had feelings for and who shared those feelings for him, but because of some arguments he separated his wife and got engaged to another woman even though he wasn't yet divorced.. and then when he went to get his divorce papers signed, the woman he was engaged to clearly saw his feelings for his wife, and he ended up back with his wife in the end. this movie is a typical example of a man's perspective of a woman and how she is supposed to wait around for him to figure his feelings out even though in marriage you can't ""break up"" you are in it for the long run dude, get it together. THAT SAID, the storm parts of the movie were great and it was fun to watch :)",1489449600,,838,4.115853658536586

This is a lame popcorn fest at best with a weak premise, terrible acting, and some extreme leaps of faith necessary to connect the horrible plot points (if you can call them that) of the film. Its most notable achievement is an almost-believable swish of Helen Hunt's hair against an obvious green screen. The CGI tornadoes were cartoonish at best.",1480118400,,414,4.684931506849315

2491998,5,B000E5KJDE,"I've bought 'Twister' on VHS, on DVD, on Blu-ray, and now as a digital download. I was (a little) obsessed with tornadoes when I was younger. I saved up for VHS documentaries, I had realistic dreams/nightmares that I saw a tornado, but forget to bring a video camera. So when this came out when I was a kid, I loved it.

With a movie poster promoting it, ""From the producers of 'Jurassic Park' and the director of 'Speed' "", how could you not see this movie? While the effects partially look a little dated today, I forgive it because it has tornadoes! Land tornadoes, water tornadoes, mile-wide tornadoes! And it has a pair of divorced storm chasers in the movie as well.

The plot is more than sufficient, the tornadoes are awesome, the action will thrill you. Recommended.

P.S. I still hope to see a tornado up close one day, and hope to have a camera ready to record when that happens.",1479168000,,890,4.481481481481482

One of the ""goofs"" is actually a goof, claiming that storm cellars were built with access from inside the house. Not true. That would be a basement and not all houses had them. We were one of the very few who even had a storm cellar where I grew up and we had to go outside to get to it (grew up in Kansas).

2493460,5,B000E5KJDE,Helen Hunt delivers. Her personality in this movie makes her even more beautiful. Bill Paxton is strong and Jaime G. Is also great. Seymore Hoffman plays a classic heavy metal hippie.,1473724800,,183,4.935483870967742

2493490,5,B000E5KJDE,"This still holds up as a great action movie.  It is an original in that it looks at a few intense days of tornados, as seen through the eyes of a group of scientists who are attempting to study them, by getting some small sensors up into the twister.  There is also the interplay of a couple in the process of divorce, who find themselves brought together by their love of the science.  This has a great early performance by Phillip Seymour Hoffman, the visual effects are from the 90s though, still they were great for the time, the technology is very old school now,  but the basic story holds up.",1473638400,,599,4.36936936936937

It's called 'Twister' but it should have been plural, since about 5 of them occur over the span of a day. Know why? Because there's nothing else to try to keep your interest. It's a desperate attempt to keep you awake through this laugher of a movie. Typical modern day Hollywood crap. Just look at the cover, it's a corny as it looks.

We sort of take it for granted that there is always time to get to safety. Before modern technology there was not. I also lived in the Shidler/Pawhuska are where some of the scenes were filmed, such as the ""flying cow"", so it is always fun to see familiar places in a film. Though is can be somewhat corny, I have a spot in my heart for this film. The effects still look very good 21 years later!!",1472342400,,544,4.240384615384615

2494214,5,B000E5KJDE,"This movie has always been one of my favorites. Revisiting it after all these years just solidifies what a solid film it really is. Hunt and Paxton are great together, every member of the supporting cast are top notch, and the special effects still rival anything on the screen today. This director is a master of taking what would seem to be a weak storyline and injecting it with heart and humor and humanity. Think Speed with Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock which he also directed as well. This is one that really holds up.",1472083200,,526,4.5473684210526315

The story is a good one and the interplay of the young actors (some who became famous later) was great and very believable, thus adding a huge part of the film its quality of almost a squad of GIs in combat. The special effects were done so well that the whole experience was made that much more emotional and absorbing as well as a vertual roller coaster ride. A great adventure.

2495101,5,B000E5KJDE,"Looking back on my youth, I find myself remembering this film fondly. Especially after realizing just how many stars this film created! You had Bill Paxton, who originally starred in ""Aliens"" and would go on to feature in ""Titanic""; Helen Hunt, who made her television debut alongside Paul Reiser (who starred in ""Aliens"", as well) on ""Mad About You"". You had already-established stars like Cary Elwes, and up-and-coming actors like the (late) Philip Seymour Hoffman. The film is really well acted and written, putting you right in the middle of the storm of the century. The characters are highly believable and, rarely, do they ever stray from their personality. The action scenes and special effects are top-notch, especially given the time period. I would highly recommend this movie to ... well ... anyone!",1470182400,,811,5.105263157894737

Hollywood bs with lots of, for the most part anyway, smooth pretty faces in their 30s, silly formula relationship issues with predictable dialogue and encounters as the sub plot -  all juxtaposed into the 'real' story of content drama that relies on not so believable high tech production and real loud sounds when, well, Lordy my, an F5 tornado passes through.

Bill Paxton was great and so was Helen Hunt (despite my best efforts to enjoy her performances she always comes across a bit snide, so she did irritate me a little in this one.) Cary Elwes should not have used a southern accent here; It was distracting. Jami Gertz was wonderful. The rest of the cast was good, but a little bit too quirky. The lines between good guys and bad guys were a bit too delineated, but....

The real star of this movie was the special special effects so 5 stars!

This fit the bill. It was entertaining and the dialogue could've been in Klingon and it wouldn't have affected our enjoyment of the film.

2495602,4,B000E5KJDE,"I take off one star for some unrealistic effects.  But that is my problem with a lot of good movies.  I just wonder WHY they have to make, for example, the last tornado scene SO unrealistic and dumb.  And for the few who haven't seen it, I will leave it for that and avoid the spoiler.

OTHERWISE, I love this movie and will treasure the memories of watching it with my now-grown daughters when they were younger.  Scared the SNOT right out of them!  The first time we watch it, I had them all on the couch and they were all clinging to me and hiding their eyes but peeking as much as they could stand it!

I've always loved Helen Hunt.  This was one of Bill Paxton's best.  This was my first look at Phillip Seymour Hoffman and he was always great, but this was the most fun role that he ever played.  (His death was a sad waste of talent, as are most drug overdoses.)

I own this and will watch it every couple of years.  And with grandkids on the way, I hope to get more of those hugs and hiding eyes moments...",1468540800,,1014,4.11734693877551

They predict tornadoes days in advance, they know what counties will get hit and approximately what time of day They have the ability now to start a watch 3-5 hours ahead of the storm giving people more than ample time to get the hell out of the way. Its very rare any more for there to be any significant loss of life from these storms like there used to be 75 years ago.",1468195200,,634,4.291666666666667

2495749,3,B000E5KJDE,"Group of ""scientists"" chase tornadoes in the midwest in a desperate attempt to try out their new homemade tool to help with detecting tornadoes earlier to help people get to safety. Their former lead scientist has bailed on them as he wanted a steady job and life. He returns to get the divorce papers signed from the other lead scientist. But gets sucked back into the rush and love his if craft. There is also another former member of their team that went ""corporate"" and has a lot of corporate money thrown at him and his new team.

The good:
Shows a movie when people still did things for the love of doing it not greed and money. They do without and don't care.
Shows a young goodlooking Bill Paxton.
No gay, abortion, anti-Christian bashing

The bad:
I remember when this movie came out. I stayed a away from it as it looked like a comedy about a serious subject to me. The flying cow was a constant on TV advertisements for this show. I thought the movie looked goofy. And it is is sorta. But it is actually more serious than it was projected to be. But then again, back then, I recall even ""Jurassic Park"" having that comedic angle in promoting that movie too. Anyway, I cannot stand Helen Hunt. Not only are her politics and head all messed up but she is so ugly. She looks like a man in some angles and like a witch with makeup on in others--seriously like a witch from the Wizard of Oz or a theme park I went to as a kid. Just not a very attractive person outside or in. So I have issues watching her. And her very cold performances . . . almost depressed like persona . . . comes through in all she does. I think that helped her in the only movie I enjoyed with her--to a certain extent--""As Good as It Gets"". Also, the entire tornado special effects were just unreal. I mean if we could all go up under an overpass and wrap our arms around the buttresses to survive a tornado they would not be as deadly as they are. But you see that. The entire premise of sending up little balls with antennas was not explained well. Yeah you get a better image of how the funnel is shaped and what it does. But so what? How does that help you warn people earlier? Missed explanation probably because there isn't one. And there were other silly plot points that just simply didn't make sense. It was just to fill time and visual space in the movie so they could sleep well knowing that they took your $12 or whatever a movie was back then.",1467244800,,2437,4.2613390928725705

He died on the cross for all mankind and took the punishment we would have had to take! He stood in our place! He purchased us by the blood He shed! He owns us and will send us to one of 2 places when we die! He wrote the plan book and used 40 different authors to pen it to paper! It's called the BIBLE= Basic Instructions Before Leaving Earth!

2496052,1,B000E5KJDE,"As  a weather buff, and a storm spotter, after viewing this film
( I had to give it a fair chance), I rate this film as a joke!
  the only disaster in this movie was the film itself. Absolutely
NO research was done in the making of this film AT ALL.
 the movie presents storm research teams as a group
of reckless fools that race wildly around the country side, creating a danger to
themselves , and anyone who has the misfortune of being anywhere near them.
 the storms appearance movements and sound were all what hollywood thinks a tornado is
  the tornado scene in ""the wizard of oz dipicts what a tornado looks moves and sounds like FAR BETTER
than this joke ever could I've seen an f -1 and an f-4 tornado, and NEITHER ONE
sounded like lions roaring, pigs squealing,or camels belching. My god didn't the special effects team even think
about going to the library and checking out a video disc on the real  storm to see how the storm develops moves
or what it looks and sounds like????? AVOID this BALL BUSTER",1459123200,,1014,4.385026737967914

2496089,5,B000E5KJDE,"This is an absolutely astounding movie. I've grown up watching this. My all-time favorite tornado-disaster movie that is rivaled only by Into the Storm. As an aspiring storm-chaser myself, I have to say I found this both slightly educational and also highly rewarding. Tornadoes may not generally happen like this in OK, but they did for the outbreak of May 19-21, 2013. And one EF5 leveled Moore. There was another outbreak the following week. So this movie isn't far-off the real-world rocker. They're simply chasing down an outbreak. They encounter MAYBE a total of 4 or 5 tornadoes here. For an outbreak, that's actually relatively small. It's the wonder of Nature, baby. And now we get to witness her dark side. Anyway, absolutely fantastic movie. I loved it, and I bet all of you will too.",1457308800,,795,4.852941176470588

2496137,5,B000E5KJDE,"I saw this movie years ago when it was came out and loved it.  I am a  huge Helen Hunt fan.  This movie is still fun.  We went to Universal Studios this past summer and of course had to go to the Twister ""ride"".  My kids had never seen the movie so as soon as we got back to the Condo where we were staying we had to rent this here on Amazon.

This movie is about a couple of storm chasers who used to be romantically together but are no longer.  They get thrown back together in an exciting thrill ride as they chase the biggest storm known as they are trying to do research.  I love the fast moving pace of this movie.  It's thrill movie along with a romance movie.  I will admit that today in 2016 some of the graphics are a bit cheesy but you have to remember the movie is also 20 years old.

As a family we laughed and had a great time watching this movie.  The kids thought it was hilarious to compare to the ""ride"" at the park.  To me this is really a classic and if you haven't experienced the ""ride"" (I put it in quotations because it's more of an experience than a ride) at Universal, you really are missing out on a hilarious time!",1454630400,,1142,4.0

I really liked this movie. The plot of it really is about getting the two main character's invention of ""DOROTHY"" into or very close to a good size tornado so that all the sensors inside of it can go ""up"" into the tornado to get good technical readings. Thus, they can get information to perhaps know more about the Tornado itself and make a more practical early warning system to help all. That's what I got out of it, with the off again on again romance going on with Helen Hunt and Bill Paxton. I thought Jami Gertz did a good job, too, as the current girlfriend of Bill Paxton. She didn't really understand all the aspects of a ""storm chaser"" thus, she basically was acting like any one of us, the viewers that were not familiar either asking pertinent questions.
Yes, one can't really believe that many tornadoes would line up so much in succession and getting ahead of one or practically on top of one is rare also unless you are directly in it's path from the get go.
I liked the movie and the suspense/action in it, but the ending with them hanging on for dear life in the well was a bit much. If that indeed had been a category F5 Tornado, they would have been shredded not only with debris, but all their clothes would have been stripped off, leaving them completely naked. How nice. lol I would have to say that my favorite character in this is the late Phillip Seymour Hoffman. Likeable and funny throughout the movie. Cary Elwes (The Crush), plays the corporate opposition with the big gadgets. Driving no less in black vehicles to boot. I wonder who came up with that idea? It couldn't have been Steven Spielberg, the ""Crystal Skull"" Champion? lol
It's a good movie to just take it for what it's worth, an entertaining time to see two or more people get involved in chasing severe tornados and trying to get their invention into one making the Country a better place, weather wise.

2496313,5,B000E5KJDE,"Although the folks who made ""Twister"" did strive for technical accuracy, it is for the most part a science fiction film; hard sf, to be sure--you can almost see the rivets on the tornadoes.  But laborious attention to technical detail is not what makes it work; this film appeals to me because it's a team of obsessed enthusiasts working together to achieve a goal that's beyond the reach of any group of sane people. SF fans might pick up on the fanac syndrome; fun stuff.

Each of the cast members is unique, and all of them are very endearing and likeable.  Lois Smith is absolutely priceless as Aunt Meg.  They deal with real human problems in the very high-stress environment of chasing severe storms, with the main plot being the romance between the two lead characters. Fun story.  Nice romance.  Great characters.  Interesting setting.  Top-notch production values.  Even the team's claptrap collection of old vehicles is fun.  What more could we ask?

This Blu-ray edition includes some fun production notes in the special features.  Part of the fascination is that this film was breaking new ground in CGI, striving to get those tornadoes looking right.  This was 1996, a time when home computers were just taking off in the mainstream market, graphics cards were kind of a neat idea, and movie-quality computer generated imagery was still the sole province of purpose-built minicomputers.

Well some nits:  There's one phrase that's repeated far, far too much in the dialog, to the point that it tosses me out of the story.  I won't repeat it here; maybe it won't bother anyone else.  The director seems to be trying to make a political point involving corporations, sponsors, and technology; but in truth, it's so ineptly done that you might not even notice as it goes by.  At worst, that bit is a parody of the constant stream of political hate messages spewing out of Hollywood and New York these days.

That said, don't sit next to a meteorologist while watching this movie, especially not an amateur meteorologist like me.  So... OK... I warned you... incredibly high number of  tornado encounters in the time frame of the movie, NSSL doesn't predict tornadoes, yeah that's a big supercell over there in the sky so storm chasers wouldn't sit around talking while that's going on, nice overcast sky but the wrong kind of clouds for a severe storm, cute effects but the aerodynamics are totally Wizard of Oz... you get the idea.  You can nitpick it to death if you know stuff.  Those things don't bother me at all in this story, but if they're important to you, they might diminish your enjoyment of ""Twister.""",1443484800,,2624,4.808035714285714

Allow me to explain... They drove their truck through fields of corn as if it was a smoothly paved road. And when they bailed from said truck, they fell into the corn as if it were a pile of marshmallows. And finally, they ran through the corn field as if they were Usain Bolt setting a new Olympic record. Puh-lease!

2496512,5,B000E5KJDE,"I love this movie. It's a classic in my world. I live in Oklahoma and enjoy how close to home it hits.

The story is about a couple who lost sight of their passion for each other, which was rooted in their passion for the science of tornadoes. The film follows them as they have an impromptu day full of storm chasing together, when the plan was to finalize their divorce. The chemistry between the couple is tangible, a sign of the high caliber acting in the film. Plenty of large stars. Plenty of action. A tolerable amount of love and romance. An exhilarating ride.

I've seen the movie a lot. I think I may even own it, but rented it out of laziness. It's worth a rent, buy and re-watch. In fact, I am struggling to review it, because it seems like such a given... who HASN'T seen this movie and who doesn't love it??",1436486400,,821,4.256410256410256

You have boring, unlikable characters, few minorities of any kind, a boring exposition that makes you just want to fast forward. The biggest sin though, something that makes or breaks a movie, is the horribly done soundtrack. It's just grating. Every scene had to have music playing during it. They couldn't let the actors or the special effects stand by itself. I just had to turn it off. I definitely wouldn't recommend to anyone.",1433462400,,535,4.6421052631578945

2496578,4,B000E5KJDE,"Living in Phoenix, with its nearly incessant sunshine, any movie with storm action this spectacular gets my vote!  In all seriousness, I know this is not the highest of drama, but it's a treat watching some very familiar actors.  Philip Seymour Hoffman is a guaranteed scenery chewer, for better or worse, but he is perfect for the over-the-top Dusty.  Anyone who has seen Star Trek Generations, The Princess Bride, Lawnmower Man, and others, will see familiar faces in fun roles.  The storm effects still look very good, even after several years of digital advances.  The characters range from cardboard to quite engaging - in many cases the actors make the most, and more, of a merely decent script.  Not a lot of depth here, but there are some touching moments.

I recommend Twister as a good evening's entertainment that pushes all the right buttons without being too pretentious about it.",1433289600,,893,4.913333333333333

2496586,5,B000E5KJDE,"Emotionally gripping and visually compelling, the action and adventure within this TWISTER film, is mesmerizing. A couple on the verge of divorce who share the same profession, that of chasing tornadoes and measuring them, so as to find out what the cause, effect and outcome will be on innocent and unsuspecting civilians within it's path, are thrown together in the midst of a tornado calamity which brings them together in the face of death, closer than ever. A non-stop, action film that depicts the fury of tornadoes and the brave individuals who chase them down, only so that they can stand up, to them. A whirlwind thriller on 2-DVD disc's which will quickly have you on the edge of your seat, and cheering for the tornado chasers. So, buckle your belt's (you'll see what I mean within the movie) and get yourself, ready. Because you can't watch, without being caught up in what's happening in this film, and all for the sake of science and weather forecasting. Are you ready? Hold on tight!

2496634,4,B000E5KJDE,"Sure its kinda stupid and almost even campy, but I still enjoy the effects from this movie even with how long ago it was made. The story still isn't half-bad either. I wanted to watch it again badly enough to go ahead and purchase it on Amazon recently, so it can't be all bad. I can't decide, though, after watching it, if I should really reward it with 4 stars or just 3. I think, adjusted for when it came out, it probably deserves closer to 4 stars due to the quality of the effects, but the story probably should cause it a downgrade to 3 stars. I'll leave it at 4 with that caveat.",1431302400,,587,4.113043478260869

2496832,5,B000E5KJDE,"I've always loved this movie, the writing, the acting, the music, all of it. It's probably because I live in TX in the middle of Tornado Alley, and I've seen tornados close up personally, and, as a reporter, I've written about them. We always have the feds come around once in a while with their high end gear. They're satisfied with staying far away from tornados and taking pictures of them with their jillion dollar cameras. That's not true of the tornado chasers out of Oklahoma University and the University of TX. Their technology is as good or better than the feds, but they'll drive right into incredibly dangerous rotations shown by radar to contain a tornado or many tornados. They're like Helen Hunt's group in the movie--turn the ACDC to 10 and drive right into a thing that can turn you into hamburger in a nanosecond. Rock and Roll maniacs--that's the OU and UT people. One of the most disturbing attributes of tornados is how they'll just suddenly appear, and only seconds later they'll be gone with the sky turning blue. This movie is also cool because it shows what funnel clouds really look like and the totally bizarre ways they can act.",1423872000,,1156,4.671568627450981

2496845,4,B000E5KJDE,"If you like the movie 'Twister' (apparently some people don't) then the Blu-ray version will please you.

I've always liked the show and think that at least some of the reason is that during my college days I took a lot of physics courses and the storm chasers in Twister have always reminded me of the people that I knew back then. The character 'Dusty' (played by Philip Seymour Hoffman) in particular was immediately (the first time I saw the movie years ago) familiar to me but I've never been able to remember who he reminded me of other than it was someone I'd known in a physics department lab environment long ago.

When I've read 'professional' reviews of the movie much time is spent talking about the computer graphic images ('cgi') but when I watch Twister most of my time is spent watching how the characters inter-react with each other. To me they come across as slightly old college kids (that should have graduated and be out focused on making-a-living) who still have the let's enjoy today attitude (and worry about tomorrow when it comes) and not be concerned about what they'll be doing in 5 or 10 years. To me that's one of the charms of the movie .... the characters enjoying being with each other while at the same time having an adventure (which any sane person would steer clear of !).

When I watch the scene with everyone sitting-down-to-lunch at Aunt Meg's I'd like to be there, squeeze my way in to a place around the table, get a clean plate, then have it covered with a nicely scorched piece-of-beef from the iron skillet on the stove, have a big 'plop' of mashed potatoes next to it, drowning in some of Aunt Meg's brown gravy (ummmm). (I spent part of some summers when I was a kid at an aunt & uncle's who lived in a tiny hamlet in central Texas and that scene from Twister really looks familiar to me .... even the style of dinner plates is 'right'.)

I'm pleased to be able to report that the Blu-ray film transfer was nicely done with none of those irritating video 'echoes' that plague some other movies that have been released in Blu-ray. On my 55 inch LCD TV the image is quite good.

The story, by Michael Crichton & Steven Spielberg captured the technology of the day as well as all the terror & immediacy of a tornado.  It is a wonderful depiction of storm chasers and as realistic as one could have.  Helen Hunt & Bill Paxton are magic together and Phillip Seymour and Lois Smith could not be better.  Easy to watch often and lots to learn if you live in tornado alley.  My A++.",1421193600,,450,4.247058823529412

Intertwined in all the twists is a love story and a dedication to find a way to discover and overcome the horrendous damage that a ""twister"" actually does in it's damage path.

2497291,2,B000E5KJDE,"I really wanted to love this movie--I love silly ""B"" movies about natural disasters and ferocious weather. But I got so annoyed by the soundtrack of this movie I was nearly throwing things at the TV in frustration. First of all, there is horrible (and I mean BAD) music playing continuously for the first half hour of the movie--no joke. It never stops. But worse, it's so loud that you simply can't hear the dialog. Also, even when there is no music, there is this ridiculous heavy wind sound effect almost constantly--even on bright sunny days without a tornado in sight! What the heck? It's like one of the sound people in the edit room just forgot to turn off the wind noise.

The movie itself is pretty horrible. And I normally don't mind horrible movies--I'm willing to go along for the ride if the actors are pleasant and the scenery is interesting. But in this case (and I'm a huge Helen Hunt fan), the acting is just bad. And the main Helen Hunt love interest (and she seems to have a handful in this film) is a really bad, bad, bad actor.

And Philip Seymour Hoffman. What can I say? My favorite actor (RIP) in a role that has got to be (easily) the worst mistake of his career. He seems to be desperately inventing energy (and lines) just to try and make his role more interesting. Forget it Philip, you had no script, it's obvious. It would have taken a faith healing to fix this film. Thankfully, they left that scene out.

Overall: a great stupid idea gone bad. I mean, when you can take a stupid idea and great actors and still come up with a fun film, well, that's what ""B"" movies are all about. But when you come up with utter garbage: give us a refund.",1409356800,,1670,4.363344051446945
2497292,5,B000E5KJDE,"This movie manages the perfect mix of characters - including tornadoes - and builds tension emotionally and visually. While by today's 3D standards, some may find the visuals not quite as imposing, the complexity of plot more than makes up for that. Admittedly, there's some stretch in believability, but if you set that aside, you'll enjoy the move many times over. - Author Claudia Newcorn.",1409356800,,392,5.046153846153846

2497347,5,B000E5KJDE,"Even though some of the movie is not realistic, it still is the best movie to bring this subject to audiences as both entertainment and semi-educational. Of course we have come a long way since then at predicting and giving out watches and warnings for tornadoes, but this movie is the one that made them real to a whole generation of audience. They were able to do that by showing exciting tornadoes, but more importantly by showing the tragedy of a tornado (Jo's father's death and Jo's aunt's home being destroyed), without making it sensational by seeing how many lives can be destroyed with no other purpose than the effects. We saw a story about people. How they deal with life on a personal level and on a professional level. How people cope with the emotional baggage of surviving a killer tornado. How people come together in tragedy and also a bit about how some people can lose sight of the whole picture and can only see what is in it for themselves. I love the movie. I bought this movie when it was only on VHS, then on DVD and now have a blu-ray copy. I watch it about once-a-year. It is a movie of entertainment, action, lessons and hope.",1407110400,,1154,4.4739336492890995

2497370,4,B000E5KJDE,"I don't know why I am so fascinated with this movie as tornados scare the heck out of me. Lots of action, but the ending is a bit corny.",1406937600,,136,3.7241379310344827
2497371,3,B000E5KJDE,"The special effects in this movie were nothing short of spectacular. I remember when this movie came out in theatres but I never saw it. I saw it three days ago for the first time. It had me spellbound. However, I felt that the plot and the characters were a bit too over the top for a feature film. The love triangle made the movie a bit too sappy for my tastes.

I won't go into the plot; many others have done that with both alacrity and detail. I will, however, say that I'm the 689th person to review this DVD and the 55th to give it a Three Star review.

To me the movie gets Two Stars alone for the spectacular special effects. Seeing a cow get blown away was a fantastic display of modern CGI technology that only Hollywood can provide. However, where they went from a 500 pound cow to a 12 ton oil truck astounds me. How is it the truck would be thrown about like a rag doll while the much lighter 4X4 they are driving stays on the road? The rationale for that was to advance the plot with a visual piece that would wow the audience. Unfortunately I can't see it happening. Granted I live on the east coast and or the most part we have only hurricanes to deal with. Midwesterners in tornado alley always have tornadoes year round to worry about.

The other Star comes from the action the characters face in chasing these storms. The twisters themselves almost become an antagonist for the main characters to attempt to overcome. Unfortunately Mother Nature is unbeaten. All we can hope to do is score a draw. Unfortunately I think the tornadoes were a bit overdone. Simply put, there are not that many tornadoes in so short of a time in so small of a geographical area. The sappy love triangle did not help matters for me. This deducted Two Stars from the rating. I would only marginally recommend this DVD. I may sell mine on Amazon.

But how quickly we forget this was done coming up on 20 years ago.  Computers used to be the size of briefcases you used to take to work.  Cell phones were the size of a shoe, they look pretty funny  being held up to one's ear.  Although, this did not scare my 12 and 6 year old like I had intended, it did get them to sit down. They also stopped asking me continuously ""is there a Tornado?! is there a Tornado?! I'm Scared.  What does that red on the screen mean? is there a Tornado?!""

So whether you are looking to scare kids, remember how big a computers used to be, simply get kids to be quiet or even like seeing cows fly through the air; This is a good movie!",1406678400,,797,4.096774193548387

The movie shows how a group of people made a device that could go into a tornado and send them feedback on how a tornado works. By doing that it helped them to better understand tornadoes.

Where we had to lean back in our seats to see the movie. OMG!! being this close felt like we were in the movie and I actually got nauseated (car sick). Even though I was nauseated and with a stiff neck. We loved the movie. I have this on VHS and just recently upgraded to digital (instant video). Picture at 1st was kinda fuzzy but as movie went on it got clearer?? Also the widescreen for me is to narrow. But then again I prefer full screen .

It stars Helen Hunt & Bill Paxton & the cast includes Cary Elwes and the late, great Philip Seymour Hoffman. the movie is about 2 rival groups of stormchasers attempting to be the first to launch new sensor probes into a tornado. To do so successfully, means you have to be dangerously close. The special effects were pioneering at the time, and the tornadoes created on-screen are quite convincing (watch out for the cow!)

I see this movie always on cable and I could not stand all the commercials, so I finally bought the Blue Ray. It's just one of those movies you can watch over and over again like Shawshank Redemption. I'm not going to get into all the technical jargon about audio & visuals. You all know you need a decent surround sound system and a 46in or more quality HDTV and your good to go. I have a Samsung sound bar with wireless subwoofer and it works perfect! The movie itself has a great cast, storyline and it's action packed. Totally worth the price. My favorite line-Dusty: He's gonna rue the day he came up against the Extreme, baby.

2497620,5,B000E5KJDE,"""Twister"" is one of my guilty pleasures, a film I watched every time one of the cable channels would broadcast it Then I broke down and bought the DVD. It's a worthwhile investment for the film alone, and the extras (commentary by Director Jan De Bont and Visual Effects Supervisor Stefen Fangmeier; short featurette ""Chasing the Tornado"" and a chilling documentary ""Tornadoes: Anatomy of a twister"" by The History Channel). Helen Hunt and Bill Paxton make a great pairing in this weather chasers go mad action film, Jami Gertz as the hapless fiance exhibits all the necessary befuddlement when she learns that her beloved's history of chasing tornadoes is not just a metaphor, and Gary Elwes makes a nice smarmy antagonist who gets his well-deserved comeupance (though I do feel sorry for his driver). Jan De Bont does indeed deliver a nail-biting, edge of your seat thriller. It's my favorite storm chaser movie, and well worth the purchase.",1392681600,,943,4.974683544303797

2497653,3,B000E5KJDE,"I like the subject matter, the cast, and for the most part, the story. That said, there were several mistakes made. Not really big ones per se, but it's obvious the writers failed to do any research or consult with their Technical Advisor. The very beginning of the film is a prime example of one such mistake. When the father came into the room to warn his family of the impending tornado, he said ""They say it's an F5!"" It's 1969. How would he know that? Dr. Fujita would not publicly reveal the F-scale for a couple of years. So, we have the anachronism. They often underscored the very real danger they were in at times (as in, if they truly acknowledged it and showed it, the movie would be much more ""exciting""). There were instances during chases they should have been swept up and thrown, they got so close. Or how size and intensity are not relative. I could go on and on, but my main point is that they would have gotten themselves killed in a couple situations if it weren't for the magic and mythic storytelling of Spielberg.",1389830400,,1037,4.43455497382199

2497668,5,B000E5KJDE,"Twister is really a very simple film to watch, just don't read to much into it.  There are no deep truths here, just sit back, eat you're popcorn and enjoy the movie.  There is only one theme here, tornados, and wide spread destruction.  That is the extent of this film, the romance is just filler, don't bother with it.  The tornados are the stars of this film, so just sit back and watch the fun.  As disaster films go its pretty good, I loved the scene with the flying cow.  The gasoline truck exploding was good too.  But that is pretty much it, so if you like disaster films, which I do, pick this one up, and sit back and enjoy the ride.  JRV",1389484800,,648,4.169354838709677

During shipment anyone could have pulled out the end and removed the movies and pushed the end back in and sent the package on to it's destination.

2497756,3,B000E5KJDE,"I remembered it being better than it actually was.  I'm something of an inactive fan of meteorology.  I find severe weather to be endlessly intriguing, so it's only natural that I'd enjoy a movie about tornadoes.

The problem with this movie isn't in the casting or the acting.  The main character's sixth-sense perception of storms and a storm's ability to produce tornadoes is pretty far-fetched.  I think the script puts too much effort into personifying tornadoes when it could've instead focused further on the utter chaos of tornadoes.  The movie even has a scene where they try to turn it into like a personal battle between them and tornadoes, which is a pretty silly premise.

On the plus side... the graphical work on the tornadoes holds its own even to this day.  They certainly spared no expense on the special effects front, and there're some funny lines and situations the characters find themselves in.

So the movie's not BAD.  It's just a bit cheesy here and there.  I want to say it finds a half-way point between mainstream and B-movie status.  I give it an average rating.",1377129600,,1092,4.780748663101604

2497760,4,B000E5KJDE,"When I moved into a small town in Iowa and bought a house, I knew that legend had it that the entire town had been leveled in a tornado of the 1890's. I knew about tornadoes from The Wizard of Oz,  but I rather scoffed when I discovered that my porch was, in  fact, the reinforced concrete roof of a tornado shelter section of the basement. I remained skeptical until the first tornado that came our way. Seeing the first very ominous signs of the approaching storm, I joined my co-workers in walking to our nearby homes and getting into their shelters. (Iowa is on the more northerly path of those twisters coming up from Texas and Oklahoma.) Aside from reminding me of those days, this picture gives a good idea of what some of these look like and the damage they can do. On that score it is worth seeing. As for the accompanying love story, well, I guess they had to have something besides the storms. Its ancient, uninteresting, irrelevant and immaterial. She (HH) Loves Him and tornadoes, He Loves Ms. X and tornadoes, Ms. X Loves Him but Not tornadoes, He and Ms. X visit the tornado zone where HH, who is his current wife, is to have the divorce papers signed to dissolve their marriage so he can marry Ms. X, a tornado comes  on the scene...... Well,  figure it out for yourself.
The acting is competent, with a good cast limited by the needs of a storm-centered movie and the traditions of same. The script is unexceptional, the direction competent. The Tornadoes and what goes with them is what you are coming to see. If you have no desire to see such storms and the surrounding conventional stories, this is not the picture for you.",1375833600,,1643,4.466666666666667

2497817,4,B000E5KJDE,"I saw this in a theater when it was first released.  The roaring of the tornadoes made it seem as if they were ripping right through the theater.  Subsequent viewings on DVD (and now Blu-ray) haven't managed to recapture the initial experience, which was utterly, terrifyingly LOUD.

Almost a perfect disaster flick, Twister, nonetheless, suffers from a flawed script/story, which was manhandled by numerous writers (including Joss Whedon).  The only time the movie is riveting is when there is a tornado on screen.  The rest is pure melodrama, the tedious affair/triangle of weatherman Bill Harding (Bill Paxton), his new girlfriend/fiance (Jami Gertz), and his estranged wife Dr. Jo Harding (Helen Hunt).  How or why this putz wants a divorce is never made clear, throughout the film he and his wife half-heartedly snipe at one another as though that alone constituted grounds for divorce.  It's an inconvenient distraction the story didn't require.  Wasn't braving tornadoes danger/excitement enough?  The second complication comes from a smart-alecky pseudo-scientist Dr. Jonas Miller (Cary Elwes).  He appears, on cue, as a minor irritant (never a rival storm chaser).  Not once do they depict actual competition between the two factions.  Both have almost identical equipment (DOROTHY and DOT), yet the only group we see struggling to get it up and working is the group led by Hunt & Paxton.  Trying to introduce Elwes as a potential enemy/patent thief is laughable at best.  He smirks a couple of times, that's the extent of his malice.  He is a toothless villain.  You would think, with the number of writers involved, one of them would have realized all this extraneous material was unnecessary, they had the perfect vehicle in the storms themselves.  Everything else just wastes time.

Standouts among the cast were Philip Seymour Hoffman, Alan Ruck, and the always reliable Lois Smith as Aunt Meg.  Helen Hunt, of course, rises well above the subject matter.  (It was also nice to see Bill Paxton toned down for a change.)",1367884800,,2033,5.121580547112462
2497828,3,B000E5KJDE,"I first saw this movie when it came out on VHS in the mid 1990s (I was 10 at the time) and I initially loved it. It was one of many reasons I went to college for meteorology. But after going to college, I fully realized how factually wrong the movie really is. Not that you have to be a scientist or a genius to see some of the flaws (i.e. inconsistencies with when the red truck takes damage in certain places and then several scenes later that damage is magically erased). But from a meteorological perspective, there are so many errors it's hard for me to enjoy the movie today without noticing them. A good example is how they would give a tornado a rating on the Fujita Scale before any damage was caused or how the actors can survive being engulfed by a mile or so wide tornado and only come out with a few scratches.

Still, it put me in the direction I am heading today and I don't look at it as an abomination. Because of how it further ""glorified"" weather to me at a young age I can't completely bad-mouth the movie. It does have some good qualities: a fairly interesting love story, what drive the characters to put themselves in danger, some comic relief, and pretty astounding special effects for the era that the movie was created in. If anything it pushes me to further understand the meteorology behind severe weather. Why does weather not work the way that Hollywood portrays it? What are the precursors to this more violent side of weather? It may have a lot of things wrong with it, but it still promotes a lot of thought. Besides, it did really well in the box office so it wasn't a total flop. I give it 3 stars out of 5.",1367884800,,1642,4.296774193548387
2497829,1,B000E5KJDE,"I was so excited when I received this ""Blu Ray"" Movie, but once I opened it, inside was a DVD.  Horrible!",1367452800,,105,4.0
2497830,5,B000E5KJDE,"Pardon me while I just inhale nostalgia.  I can still recall 1996, being at the house of a friend whose parents had rented Twister on [guffaw!] video cassette.  Both of us were allowed to watch it unsupervised.  And trust me: being 10 years old and living in a rather less sophisticated portion of Tennessee, and able to watch a PG-13 movie which was populated purely by adults who were coping with life-and-death situations instead of children/adolescents surviving the travails of middle/high school, made one feel pretty badass.  (I know I wasn't the only 10-year-old in 1996 so I'm sure those people know *exactly* what I'm talking about.)

No, it's not a good movie.  Yes, it's moronic and cartoonish.  Unfortunately, my memory informs my appreciation of this movie, and since the world of the 10-year-old tends to be small, and since the household in which I was then living was particularly restrictive, this Van-Halen-blaring expletive-sprinkled effects-laden crowd-pleasing clunker seemed the pinnacle of sophistication.  Of course now I know better, and in a way it's shaming to not only have it in the repertoire of the culture of my childhood but to also yearn for that provincial/unpolitical/lower-class existence of which this simple pleasure was a part, and which it perhaps helped to enforce.

Still, knowing better doesn't entirely prevent one from self-indulgence, which I've clearly done throughout this review.  And it was the '90s!!!!",1367280000,,1455,5.232758620689655

I was in a twister myself while driving in Missouri and someone close sat through one that touched down on her house in Edwardsville, Illinois.  You never forget the sound or the shear power of the wind.  You could scream and no one hear you five feet away.  I bought the Blu-ray for the improved picture quality and sound and I am not disappointed.  The price for this exceptional upgrade in quality is well worth adding it to your library.

2497841,4,B000E5KJDE,"Bought this years ago on DVD as I am a fan of storm chasers. Can't say I was disappointed, lots of action and cast of great actors, especially Bill Paxton and Helen Hunt. Somw of the tornados come out of nowhere, such as the one at the drive-in theater scene, kind of cheesy. But that last scene where the monster twister comes at Helen and Bill is a bit overdone. I mean a tanker truck coming at them and it just flies above them, then they drive through the flames with their truck unscathed. Then they try to overrun it by chasing it through a corn field and the truck and Dorothy (the scientific canister that contains the balls to measure the twister inside. Of course Bill's truck is wrecked already so they just let the truck on cruise control run into the path of the tornado and bail out, only to find the twister has shifted track and they run for their lives to the barn, then the water main house and anchor themselves. A bit overdone, I think, an F5 tornado wouldn't have let them just hold onto a water pipe with some leather belts holding them in place. All in all though, it is 113 min of good, solid entertainment. HOwever, i really do think the reality series, Storm Chasers, does it the best chasing real-life twisters, but still Twister is a decent movie with never a moment of dullness, and it was nice at the end where Bill and Helen reconcile with that long kiss, that was touching.",1362787200,,1405,4.366412213740458

The special effects were pretty good too. I can't really comment on the audio too much as I listen with external speakers hooked up to my tuner. Nothing fancy, but the sound is fine with me. Another good thing is the aspect ratio of 2:40:1 which lets you see the entire movie from side to side on your tv screen. People are always complaining about the black bars on the top & bottom of the film in this type aspect ratio. I want to see the whole film if I can & if you're into the movie you shouldn't notice the black bars, especially against the black tv frame.

2497904,2,B000E5KJDE,"I hate to rain on everyone's tornado here, but to me--the special effects of ""Twister"", however formidable, are undone by a juvenile script and characters who range from smug (Paxton, Hunt) to shrill (the incessantly whacky band of storm chasers). Ironically, the only character that came close to being ""sympathetic"" for me was the one I was supposed to hate--Jami Gertz (as Paxton's square fianc). Never mind that she is supposed to be Mrs. Wrong--uptight, unadventurous, etc. Her intelligent portrayal of a not-so-intelligent woman gives the film its only honest laughs as well as its only pathos, and I'll take her any day over Hell-Yeah Helen and Damn-Straight Bill, or their band of sycophantic cheerleaders who practically shake pom-poms and do victory splits every time either character speaks.

Their Greek Chorus-like function, I suppose, is to remind us who we're rooting for, but personally it turns me off to be dictated to quite so transparently. Don't TELL me who to like--MAKE the characters likable and I'll like them, okay? The whole rowdy ensemble is thrust with such gusto down our throats, one hates them on principle alone.

That bitch-fest aside, the twisters are obviously the main attraction here, and they produce a few powerful moments. Take the atmospheric opening scene-in which the cyclone is personified as a malevolent predator, like an evil Santa Claus who instead of leaving gifts, comes to rob you of that which you love. The idea of the twister as a character is  especially effective, but the film makers never really carry that through, and so the film misses its chance to be poetic. However, spectacle is the compensation, and  in much the same way as the sinking ship was the payoff in ""Titanic"", the whirling dirt funnels--whether they are characters or just random vacuums-- are still exciting and are the real stars of ""Twister"". And as long as they're wrecking lots of havoc,  the movie cannot be totally sunk by it's cast, script, or even the misguided direction that constantly threatens to pull them all into its suck zone.",1339113600,,2071,5.008720930232558

Helen Hunt is the perfect actress to pull you in with her sad story and make you cheer her on to success, not only with her storm chasing, but in her relationship with Bill's character. I wanted to jump through the screen and shake Paxton's character when he brings the new fiance to visit his wife to get divorce papers signed. I jumped up and cheered when he came to his senses. The love story is just a portion of this film with aggressive, frightening tornadoes being center stage. I was impressed with the power displayed by the storms created for this film. The supporting cast is well rounded and chosen with talent. These people are believable and seem like they could actually be a tight-nit group of coworkers trying to do something good for the world.

2497934,5,B000E5KJDE,"Ever since my childhood, I've held an interest in extreme weather. Not enough to turn it into a career per say, but enough to see the occasional thunderstorm as more than a mere inconvenience. Holding such a view, my slobbering love affair with Twister would seem a forgone conclusion. No lie, I flat-out love the movie and can easily muster multiple viewings in a single day without batting an eyelash. Still, despite being a Twister junkie, there are several things about this movie I can't make excuses for.

While I wouldn't want to change any member of the cast, I think everyone can admit that Bill Paxton is a terrible actor. From classics like ""Dorothy, you took her you damn thief!"" to ""Jo, things go wrong, you can't explain it you can't predict it!"" Paxton is extremely wooden at times. As bad and entertaining as that can be, this allows the other members of Jo's storm chasing team (like Philip Seymour Hoffman) to steal some well deserved spot light every once in a while.

Another blessing is how the special effects and action bury a truly predictable love story, a necessary evil that plays out by the numbers. Impressive as the special effects are in general sense, the problems encountered during the shoot can be easily deciphered by the viewer through the movie's myriad of continuity errors. The sidewinder's on the right side of the road, so the rational thing to do would be to turn left at the last intersection? Watch the movie enough and the spotty editing becomes a running gag in and of itself.

All problems aside, if you're looking for movie that shows Mother Nature at her worst, Twister is going to be at the top of your list despite all of its flaws.",1308960000,,1684,4.644295302013423

2497938,4,B000E5KJDE,"Twister may seem like a simple movie, but it really makes for a great action film.  The movie is directed by Jan de Bont (Director of Speed).  Twister is a non-stop action film about storm chasers who are trying to use a new technology to put sensors into a tornado and obtain scientific data on how tornadoes form.  The special effects are pretty good for the late nineties.

The most memorable time I saw this movie was at the theater with my mom and towards the end of the film a tornado warning went out in the area because a funnel cloud was spotted about a mile away.  We had to leave the theater!  It definitely made for an intense experience!

I think Twister is a well made movie with a fun story, good effects, great sound, and a cast that you will cheer for!  I have lived in Tornado Alley (Nebraska to north Texas) and the movie is well made.

Someone really did their homework on this story.  I no longer live in Oklahoma and I really miss the fantastic cloud formations I witnessed.  This film has its critics but I am here to tell you that they captured the suspense and fear connected with living in ""TORNADO ALLEY""!!!!

2497943,5,B000E5KJDE,"If you're a child of the 90s like I am, you'd know that the 90s was basically struck by the the ""bug of disaster movies"". Basically, movie after movie was a disaster movie most of them being brainless (yet silly nonetheless). It wasn't until ""Twister"" got released that there was finally a be all end all of disaster movies, and it was a summer smash. I, at 6 years old, was too young to watch it in the theatre, but I remember seeing the trailers on TV. And when it got released on VHS, my parents made a mad dash out to buy the video.

This was one of my childhood favorites. I used to watch it a lot, even to the point where the videotape was worn out so we'd have to buy a second tape. However as I got older I hadn't seen it as much, in fact I remember the last time I saw it before back in April was when I was 9 or something. I dunno how this detachment suddenly happened, but who knows.

Cut to April 2010. I'm in HMV to buy Avatar on blu-ray, and when I reach the ""T"" section, guess what movie I find? That's right, Twister. I had no idea the classic was out on  blu, and so I rushed it and Avatar to the counter to suddenly buy. It was only 7.99 too! And watching it for the first time on blu was a real nostalgic rush. Oh, the memories...

Basically this nothing more than a cliche fest with special effects, but hey, it's done well, to the point where you're too busy having fun to even notice the cliches. It has a great cast including Bill Paxton and Helen Hunt not to mention Cary Elwes, a FANTASTIC soundtrack (I loved the usage of Tori Amos near the beginning!), tornadoes, great special effects and is overall just really fun to watch. And who could forget the scene where they are inside the tornado near the end?

The blu-ray transfer is actually very good. The video quality is pretty good, not great though- not a whole lot of depth, but at least colors are good, and Oklahoma looks pretty. The audio... holy cripe, I had to keep checking outside my window to see if there was a tornado! It is THAT good. Debris hitting the windsheild, a house rolling onto a road having been torn from its foundation, and an exploding tanker truck has never sounded so lovely before. I swear, this is THE ultimate audio experience if you want some good disaster fun.

Overall, if you've never seen Twister, put the disc in the player, crank up that sound system of yours, and just sit back and enjoy the ride. Don't pay attention to the negativity from people who don't know how to have fun and watch a movie. Just expect a fun filled Tornado flick, and try not to get too paranoid about tornadoes hitting your area!",1294012800,,2622,4.244488977955911

The acting,the story and the logic. The cast do alot of stupid things to get close to the twister like hiding under a brige even though it might collapse on you and/or turn into a wind tunnel of suction. Another dumb thing they do is use a belt,ties it to a heater to keep themself safe from the F-5. You make Odie look like Albert Einstein when you do dumb things like that. It would never work in real life. Flaw number 3: We see more of the couple arguing then the twister itself. When did this movie become ""Mad About You""? The arguing couple storyline also slows the movie down. Did you also notice that there is more then one tornado in ONE DAY. HOW MANY TWISTERS CAN THERE BE IN 24 HOURS? Was this like the lost plague of Egypt? It does not happen in real life. Overall,If you like special effects,buy it. If not,burn it. I give this dvd a 1 out of 10.",1292544000,,1006,4.272251308900524

2497947,5,B000E5KJDE,"When this movie came out as one of the earlier Dolby 5.1 DVD titles in 1990s, it was the showcase movie - or the benchmark - for which 5.1 is utilized. You can actually feel you are in the middle of the tornado the way the sound was decoded and played throughout the 5 speakers.

This blu-ray's surround sound still hold that gold standard in my opinion. It really utilize the two rear speakers well for 1) for objects flying from front to back and vice versa, and 2) within vicinity of the tornado when debris hit on your behind as well as the wind noises. The best part is you can hear transition of a debris flying from one speaker to the next, which gives the inside-the-tornado effect. This is something I find still difficult to realize with other modern titles, especially action films. They might have lots of explosions and clearer sounds, but never got that extensive directional feel.

As for the picture, it's still clear but obviously softer then the recent movies. But still can see edges of the hail (larger ice balls), and slanted rains. Most of the skin details of the actors can be seen pretty well also.

For the price of this blu-ray (around $10), it's a great get to add to collection. I would still use this movie to show case surround sound more than any other recent action movies.",1291852800,,1305,4.4978902953586495

2497960,4,B000E5KJDE,"What makes TWISTER such an enjoyable film isn't the individual actors' portrayals (though two of the cast, Helen Hunt and Phillip Seymour Hoffman went on to win Oscars for other films), but rather the sense of mad exuberance that permeates this film, much like another Hoffman vehicle,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pirate-Radio/dp/B00320J6WS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pirate Radio</a>. Although the ""divorcing couple"" plotline holds no surprises, the rest of the film does. TWISTER is a rush.

Bill (Bill Paxton) and Jo (Helen Hunt) are two storm-chasing meterorologists in northern Oklahoma. They are the couple who are on the cusp of divorce. As a matter of fact, Bill has returned to rural Oklahoma from his job in the city as a TV meteorologist to force Jo's hand into signing the divorce papers, and he's brought his fiancee Melissa (Jami Gertz), a psychotherapist, along as proof that the marriage is truly ended. Predictably, of course it isn't, and once Jo and Bill see each other their relationship, as tempestuous as a twister, begins anew, leaving Melissa to blow in the wind.

What isn't so predictable is the pirate energy of Jo and Bill's storm-chasing crew. Nominally a group of scientists, they're really a bunch of adrenaline junkies who get off on putting themselves in harm's way. Jo, for her part, has an Ahabian obsession to conquer tornadoes, since she lost her father to one.

Jo, both sexy and ramshackle in her wife-beater top and chinos, reflects her crew perfectly. Their vehicles are dented and battered. They're ballcap wearing, mullet-headed geniuses who whoop and holler ever louder as storms toss farmhouses into the air (""We're in the suck zone! Yeah!"") and fix their ratty equipment with baling wire and chewing gum. They hate Jason (Cary Elwes) a rival storm-chaser who has sold out by accepting corporate sponsorship and drives shiny new Hummers with all the fixings and a Doppler radar you can see your face in. Both groups have developed a new technology to inject sensors into storms (Jo's homemade ""Dorothy"" and Jason's factory milled ""Dot""), and it's a race to see who does it first.

A veritable conga line of tornadoes begins to spawn, and the crew races headlong over the area trying to ""study"" them.  Bill joins them, despite his promises to Melissa. Melissa is in hysterics after Bill's truck gets spun like a top by three nearby waterspouts, but Bill and Jo are both exhilarated. Melissa, seeing how the wind is blowing, ends the engagement.

The crew dash to the town of Wakita, where Jo's p*ss-and-vinegar Aunt Meg lives, to stoke up on food. As they eat, they hear of an F5 tornado, the most powerful type, in the area, and pile pell-mell out the door to find it. It finds them first, and devastates Wakita, but the huge F5 storm provides some of the best CGI disaster footage ever, as gasoline tankers and combines fly like matchsticks, a cow jumps over the moon, and houses implode. The cow is an inspired addition, the signature of this picture. (TWISTER was also the first-ever DVD release and the last-ever DVD-HD release, and the second highest-grossing film of 1996.) All ends relatively well, though nobody in the picture is ever really down to earth.  Particularly the cow.

A great light film that will have you hopping in your seat, TWISTER is well worth owning.",1289779200,,3370,5.059459459459459

Helen Hunt and Bill Paxton's interaction in this movie is just fantastic.  Although this is another one of the DISASTER MOVIES, it also brings with it a very smart and suddle undertone of sense of humor.  I believe the verse ""WE HAVE COWS"" says it all.  Great show, cleverly written and presented in such a way that your not sitting there thinking good lord its another disaster movie.  The effects are wonderful on both versions, but they truely shine in the blue ray format.

2497963,5,B000E5KJDE,"I love this film & it never ceases to amaze me. It is non-stop action & plenty of SUPER-AMAZING ""footage"" or rather scenes.

This fast-paced story takes you along as witness to a bunch of storm chasers as they try to get internal data from tornados with an invention called ""Dorothy."" A subplot of husband & wife in the midst of a divorce does not weigh you down. It is gently woven into the film in such a way that it enlivens the main plot rather than having the opposite effect of boring you to death.

There is plenty of more-than-amazing & impressive tornado scenes & you have to give credit to the film director & computer geniuses who made this happen. There is a documentary & I suggest watching it because it explains how really difficult all this was to create. A tribute to these people is necessary.

This film is captivating, it is a thrill ride. It keeps you fascinated, amazed, scared, laughing & crying & on the edge of your seat. Helen Hunt's intensity is infectious. You can't help to be a part of the unbelievable enthusiasm & fun-loving eagerness of those testosterone & adrenaline junkie American guys who can't wait to go into the path of deadly danger (the tornado) & call it ""FUN!"" There is profound tragedy, there is fun, there is danger, there is exhilaration & triumph--all this to be found in this movie.

I think every European should watch this movie to truly understand what America suffers during & after a tornado--animals & people suffer & are killed, ancient trees are shredded & homes are turned into pulp & rubble.

I got this out of a Walmart bin, but you can't beat this price!

Oh, I forgot to mention--a Happy Ending.

""Twister"" is Okay.  It's not Michael Crichton's best story writing film effort.  Far from it.  And the other known Micheal Crichton film currently available on Blu-Ray is ""Sphere"".  It's had mediocre reviews, but yet it too, has been made available on Blu-Ray.

2497968,3,B000E5KJDE,"Twister is a good example of a film made purely to showcase special effects with a very simple plot concocted to hold it all together. I wouldn't have minded had it not been pure soap opera nonsense. I expect more from Michael Crichton.

I first (and last) saw Twister at a preview screening on a sunny Saturday night on July 20th 1996 (exactly 14 years ago today). It was one of those lovely screenings where the movie just starts right away and you're not bothered by long ads or trailers. After such brilliant teaser trailers I was initially let down by the mechanical and pedestrian nature of the story.

The story outside of the twisters ain't nothing new. A man and his estranged wife get back together amid the chaos. Wow! As if that wasn't done in Die Hard, The Abyss and ID4 already. Bill Paxton and Helen Hunt are good (as is her fondness for going without a bra in a white vest with lots of rain pouring down) but the rest of the cast are just scenery. Jamie Gertz is the perfunctory ""in"" for the audience. And why Cary Elwes attempted to do a Texas accent when he is clearly incapable is beyond me. And don't get me started on Philip Seymore Hoffman! I wanted one of the twisters to drop a silo on his head. All the storm chaser team do is go ""yeah"", ""let's do this"" and ""rock 'n' roll"". Usually in movies a cast this large is killed off one by one, but no such luck here. Not only are they mostly useless to the story progression but they are deeply annoying.

Where the film does succeed is delivering spectacle. The effects may be well over a decade old now but they still look good and the sound design is quite brilliant. If you go to Twister looking for anything else you'll be sorely disappointed.

Still, as modern disaster movies go, it's towards the top of the pile.",1279584000,,1788,4.36036036036036

2497971,4,B000E5KJDE,"It's just one darn tornado after another.  Never saw such a storm system before.

Twister is improbable.  Twister is maniacal.  It's a thrill ride that's guaranteed to hold your interest from beginning to end.  And how cool is it that Van Halen's Humans Being made it into the soundtrack?  It's a great tornado-chase song.

I love Twister.  I'm into the whole midwest vibe it so effectively creates.  I love Helen Hunt. If Twister was a bad movie, I think I'd still watch it just to see her.  I love the effects - they are extremely effective!

Some of the scripting is a bit cheesy, to be sure.

For instance, the campy melodrama behind the following scene is just so yeesh:

Joey: [Discussing at Meg's on the tornadoes they have seen so far] No, that was a good size twister. What was it, an F3?
Bill: Solid F2.
Melissa: See, now you have lost me again.
Bill: It's the Fujita scale. It measures a tornado's intensity by how much it eats.
Melissa: Eats?
Bill: Destroys.
Laurence: That one we encountered back there was a strong F2, possibly an F3.
Beltzer: Maybe we'll see some 4's.
Haynes: That would be sweet!
Bill: 4 is good. 4 will relocate your house very efficiently.
Melissa: Is there an F5?
[Everyone goes dead silent]
Melissa: What would that be like?
Jason 'Preacher' Rowe: The Finger of God.
Melissa: None of you has ever seen an F5?
Bill: ...Just one of us.
[Looks upstairs, indicating Jo]

And speaking of cheesy, I don't like Bill Paxton as the leading man in this.  There's something overly contrived about him, almost to the point of being plastic.  But the other characters are fairly interesting.

Especially, of course, Helen Hunt. :-)",1272844800,,1655,4.632302405498282

It has a great cast, a story close enough to real that my belief was easily suspended, and special effects creating a herd of the greatest movie ""villains"" of all time.

Bill Paxton and Helen Hunt play a married couple literally one signature away from divorce.  They are modern meteorologists and their passion is chasing tornadoes.  See, Helen watched a monster storm suck her father out of a storm shelter as a child, and now she is determined to launch ""Dorothy"" - a scientific data-collection gizmo - into an actual tornado so that the data can be analyzed and a tornado warning system designed based on this data.  This is all back story with a single purpose - put our heroes in the path of several scenery destroying special effects.

We catch up with them on a big day - not only has Bill come to get Helen's final signature so that the divorce is final, but a storm's a-brewin'... and it looks like it could be a BIG one.

Indeed - well over half of the film is spent in about every variety of ""holy SMOKES, wouldn't THIS be cool!"" moment the screenwriters and special effects wizards could conjur.  We learn in the expository intervening scenes that Tornadoes go all the way up to a Five on the Fujita scale - and only Helen has ever seen a Five, the one that claimed her father years ago.

We get to see tornadoes toss around heavy farm machinery like a puppy playing with a chew toy.  Our heroes are out in the middle of it, of course, trying to put ""Dorothy"" into the path of the cyclone, and giving us a thrilling up-close look at the eye of the beast.  Like a roller coaster ride, we know that every scene with a breather is going to be followed by the attack of the swirling menace.

In one of my favorite scenes the storm chasers are taking a breather outside a drive-in movie theater.

Then the screen starts ripping apart, first one tile at a time, then finally bursting as the deadly twister again bears down on our heroes.

The best thing about this film is that it draws us in by recreating all manner of twister stories we have heard as part of our urban legend education. This brought as much success to the film as the terrific special effects.
If you're from tornado alley as I am, stories of flying cows, raining tractors, boards melding into trees, 'going green' skies, 'cones of silence' and more are part of the tornado lore we've heard, or even seen.
Director Speilberg at the time was, however, criticized as unrealistic for having included a mile wide tornado with unheard of ferocity. Then, the following year, the Midwest encountered a horrifically similar one - proving again that writer Crichton and Speilberg together had an uncanny sense of what is possible.
If you haven't seen this movie - do. Dispersed between heart pumping action scenes are humor lines that have become classics ... ""I gotta go.. we've got COWS!""

How about ""Earthquake"", ""Meteor"" or ""Towering Inferno""...loved 'em all. With the 80's disaster flicks kind of disappeared. The all-star casts shifted their attention to ""Fantasy Island"" and ""The Love Boat"" I guess? Anywho, once the millenium began to approach in the late 90's, Disaster flicks began popping up once again. And to make it better, special effects progressed from models and miniatures to full blow CGI mega-disasters.
With ""Twister"" coming out in 1996, you get a fun little flick about a group of ""storm chasers"" hanging out in Oklahoma during tornado season. The basic storyline is that they want to launch a new piece of equipment to study tornadoes from the inside. Basically a trash can full of Pokemon orbs. To do this, they must set the unit in front of a rampaging tornado. So we get Helen Hunt, Bill Paxton, Jami Gertz & Philip Seymour Hoffman running around the midwest farm country in a beat-up caravan meeting all kinds of cool CGI tornadoes. Luckily (or unluckily depending on your viewpoint), they do this on the same day that about 20 tornadoes decide to ravage a 15 or 25 square mile area of Oklahoma.
Sure it's unrealistic, but the special effects are cool. I did chuckle to myself when watching this disk on my TV with surround sound. I never noticed there was a ""growling"" sound effect added whenever a tornado appeared. This is a fun, summer movie and not to be taken too seriously. Like most good disaster movies, the special effects are the biggest draw.

2498009,4,B000E5KJDE,"This a review of the DVD, not the movie. There are as many opinions of the movie as there are people to watch it.
The newest DVD is a vast improvement over the first two releases. The image is cleaner with stronger colors, better matched to the theatrical print. It also has few in any visible mpeg artifacts. The sound is essentially a match to the second DVD release, without the DTS track. The big improvement in sound is on the commentary track. In the previous release, the movie's audio wasn't reduced enough in volume and would often overwhelm the commentators, to the point that one couldn't understand a word they were saying. This is corrected in the new version.
The second DVD in the set is largely made up of previously released material. But there are two documentaries added that make it worthwhile. ""Twister Revisted"" is an interesting anecdotal look back on the production. Also included is a History Channel documentary that gives viewers a look at the reality of tornado research.
For those of you with whom this is a guilty pleasure, it's defintiely worth the investment.",1234483200,,1091,4.777777777777778

2498012,3,B000E5KJDE,"The film that kicked off the 90s disaster movie revival, Twister is a spectacle, pure and very simple, with just enough plot to propel you to the next big set piece of destruction as ex-stormchaser Bill Paxton finds himself swept up in the thrill of the chase as he tries to get Helen Hunt to sign their divorce papers. Don't look for anything profound - Cary Elwes' villainous better-funded rivals even drive black vans while, after the film goes to enormous lengths to stress how all-powerful the twisters are by throwing oil tankers and even houses at them, the heroes survive by, er, tying themselves to some pipes and holding on very tight. Yet the special effects are suitably apocalyptic while the film has a real sense of speed and motion thanks to some great helicopter and driving work, and even the presence of two of the most irritatingly mannered supporting actors in the business, Philip Seymour Hoffman (in the Jack Black role) and Jeremy Davies, doesn't dampen the dumb fun. And no doubt about it, the cow is definitely the star of the show.

After  a previous underwhelming  release, the 2-disc  set  finally gives  the film a  decent  selection  of  extras even if the transfer  doesn't  appear to be an imprpvement on the previous  issue.",1232755200,,1257,4.763888888888889

2498016,5,B000E5KJDE,"""Twister"" is a film that I repeatedly enjoy.  I recently got a DVD to replace my videocassette.  Jan de Bont who became a star director with ""Speed"" & then faded with ""Speed 2"" & ""The Haunting"" does an excellent job piloting this project.  The film was nominated for Oscars for Best Sound & Best Visual Effects.  Bill Paxton who was creepy in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Frailty/dp/B00006AUJR/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Frailty</a>&nbsp;plays Bill Harding who is trying to get his ex-wife to sign divorce papers.  Paxton may not have great depth; but in a film which hinges on visual effects, he does a good job.  He shows up with his fiancee Melissa who is a sex therapist.  Jami Gertz plays the character as a prissy, overly organized person who is out of place with these storm chasers.  Helen Hunt who won an Oscar for ""As Good As It Gets"" & a Golden Globe for TV's ""Mad About You,"" is the real star as Jo Harding.  Jo is driven by the childhood loss of her father to a tornado and researches to improve early warning capability.  She is emotionally still attached to Bill and finds it difficult to let go.  As the day of tornados gets underway, the interplay between the two sparks the film, similar to the great formula for&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mr-Mrs-Smith-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B000AP04FG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mr. & Mrs. Smith (Widescreen Edition)</a>&nbsp;where Angelina Joli & Brad Pitt played spouses who argue throughout the action.

Many of the smaller parts are well played despite the snippets of dialogue.  Lois Smith who was in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/P-S/dp/B0006TL806/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">P.S.</a>&nbsp;& played Jack Nicholson's sister in ""Five Easy Pieces"" plays Aunt Meg who is always glad to see her niece and feed her crowd.  Alan Ruck who worked with de Bont on ""Speed"" and was recently in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Happening/dp/B001DZOC6Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Happening</a>&nbsp;plays Rabbit who continually checks maps.  Gary Busey's son Jake plays a mobile lab technician.  Philip Seymour Hoffman who would later be nominated for an Oscar for ""Charlie Wilson's War"" and win one for ""Capote"" plays the rock blasting Dusty who talks to Melissa about ""the suck zone.""  By the time the final frames arrive, we feel like we've been as close to a tornado as we are ever likely to want to get.  There are a few extras on the DVD scenes that give an appreciation for the lean cut de Bont made for the film.  In addition, Van Halen do a music video on what is also the excellent soundtrack&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Twister-Music-From-The-Motion-Picture-Soundtrack/dp/B000002N7W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Twister: Music From The Motion Picture Soundtrack</a>.

Now,the the transfer on Blu-Ray has been cleaned up and improved dramatically. It's not reference quality,of course,but I give the picture a solid 4 out of 5 for a movie of this age. I can't comment on the new lossless soundtrack because I am unable to decode yet.

Years later the effects are just as incredible, effective and powerful as ever. Various kinds of twisters were created, and they are so believable. Every time I watch this movie, during the twister scenes my heart pounds and my eyes are glued to the screen. It's just so believable and so darn exciting!

I have to disagree with the person who said the story line takes second place to the special effects. Yes, the special effects are totally remarkable, but this movie would be nothing without the great characters and complicated, moving love story. Throw in some first rate actors with tremendous appeal and you've got a winner. This movie holds your attention throughout and entertains on every level.

Bottom line: I highly recommend this movie as a purchase.",1224806400,,911,4.870967741935484

I've yet to see anything made more than ten years ago come even close to that title. Twister is one of my all time favs that can be watched at least twice a year. I may get this in BR; but, that's an exception. As far as I'm concerned, the movie industry is only porting most of their products in to BR, without much concern about quality, to get more money in their pocket, knowing full well that the end result could be much...much better if they took the time to remaster each and EVERY title to maximize the end result.

The special effects are so cool and the acting is really good, especially Helen Hunt, Phillip Seymour Hoffman, and Jami Gertz. I have owned the regular DVD for some time and because I recently acquired a Blu-ray player and love the great picture and sound it affords, I decided to duplicate this movie and get the Blu-ray version.  I have to say that after watching it the first time I can't really tell that much difference in the Blu-ray compared to the standard wide-screen version and was a little disappointed in that.  I didn't think the resolution of the picture was as good as the other Blu-rays I have seen.  I'll give it the benefit of the doubt that maybe the sound was a little better. As prices of Blu-rays continue to drop I will continue to purchase them in lieu of the standard ones, but right now they are still fairly pricey.

If you're willing to suspend disbelief, I mean, seriously suspend it, you'll love this movie.  It's got its own sort of logic, though seriously, if a downdraft and microburst can tear up a drive-in movie theater, how come an F5 tornado doesn't break the leather strap at the end?

First I will say, I own this movie, and I enjoy this movie. I will also so say that I am truly intrigued by the power, beauty and unpredictable wonder of natures most dangerous natural disaster. Although I enjoyed this movie for the sheer purpose of entertainment, I can certainly understand why tornado fans found this movie to be annoying, farfetched and unrealistic.

The predictable: You know from the first 15 minutes of the movie that Helen Hunts chaser team, armed with the ""Human Barometer"", the beat up cars and the outdated equipment would come out on top. You know from the start that Helen Hunt and Bill Paxton would kiss and make up, literally. Jamie Gertz. Her true purpose in this movie was to be someone the audience could relate to. She asked the questions that an audience who doesn't know much about tornadoes would ask. She cried and screamed and showed fear of tornadoes instead of excitement like our main characters. She also filled the holes on the back story, by asking more questions: ""Who's that guy?"" or ""Is this your attempt to get Billy back?"".

The unexpected: The final duo between the rival gangs. Too bad it didn't add anything to the plot.

The unnecessary: The rival gang really didn't add anything to the movie.  They didn't make for competition, suspense, twist, anything. The trip to the aunts house to eat up all her food, still don't know that point, except maybe for the mini ""moment in science"" scene at the table where they tell the audience (Jaime Gertz, and all of us at home that may not know) about different tornado intensity, and how only one of the members have lived through an F5 tornado...ooooooh NOW we understand Helen Hunt's drive. The flying cow (it was just one...he did a double orbit).

The potentially annoying:

1. The clich that the best place to be to chase 6 tornadoes in one day is Oklahoma and Kansas. In fact, you have enough time to get ahead of the super cell to a descending tornado, no matter where you are in these two states.

2. How Bill and Helen Hunt managed to literally come face to face with a tornado, I mean right in the PATH of a twister, not once, not twice, but THREE times and come out with minor bumps and bruises. First time, they hid under a bridge (big tornado safety no no) to escape the winds of the storm...when we all know that the wind is the least of anyone's concern in a tornado, it's the DEBRIS that is the number one killer....The second time, tornados strong enough to spin their car and send a cow orbiting around them, but leaves them safely on the ground and does NO DAMAGE to the car...and the third time...the dangerously F Tornado, the big finale, JUST ripped apart the barn they crouched in, but left them safe and sound, they were even able to open their eyes and look into the heavens...never once did they get clunked in the head with a wooden beam. Never mind the fact that once the tornado ""tossed"" the debris into the path of our heroes, it never moved it again, with the exception of the tree trunk that was sent in a perfect line to blow up the truck.

3. The hail. Nothing more than buckets of ice cubes tossed into the path of our main characters. A real hail storm is just that, a storm and the balls of ice fall at dangerous speeds with enough potential dent the hood of your car and break out a windshield or at least CRACK it...especially if you are really close to a tornado, which on every instance, they were within a 1/2 mile of the twister.

4. How Bill Paxton can look at the updraft of a tornado, and predict where it was going. He could pick up dust from the ground and let it blow from his hand, and know what longitude and latitude the next storm would hit.

5. How the tornado always managed to dissipate right after the Helen and Bill encounter...maybe THEY are the secret to stopping the dangerous storm...after all, Bill ""The Extreme"" Paxton got his nude body close enough to a storm to chuck a bottle of whisky in it and that stopped it from touching the ground....**TORNADO FACT** A tornado is not a cloud. It is a column of rotating air. They kick up a cloud of dirt and debris from the air and ground giving the appearance of being a cloud.

Final Thought: This is the kind of movie where, if you have knowledge about tornadoes, you have to absolutely let go of that knowledge to sit back and enjoy this movie. Although this movie is based on a real phenomenon, it really plays on the myths and fears that the average person has about tornadoes, and that's what made this movie successful. I enjoyed the action and the destruction. The plot, although predictable, still kept me engaged until the next tornado scene, and there were many in this film. Hollywood creates movies for entertainment. This movie was entertaining, to say the least. But if you are looking for a documentary of tornadoes, and the lives of real storm chasers, this may not be the movie for you.",1211673600,,4943,4.516778523489933

Yeah we all know how scary very bad weather can be to someone 13 or under lol. This ""remastered"" version looks and sounds excellent, much better than the previous dvd release.

I'm thinking they are in a hurry to rush this stuff out so keep an eye on reviews before buying.

2498080,1,B000E5KJDE,"I don't know if I would've forgiven this movie more if I hadn't had an amateur meteorologist with me when I saw it or not.  But I did.  And his constant interjections of ""that would NEVER happen"" got so annoying that I finally had to say:

""Hey, I never went to Weather School but I KNOW that couldn't happen!""

My hopes were also high since Michael Crichton's name was on the screenplay.  But then again, so was his wife-at-the-time listed as a screenwriter.

But what really got me was that this Hollywood monstrosity had an opportunity to use the best sound and state-of-the-art visual effects to show the raw power and terrifying danger of a real tornado...and they instead chose to pay endless homages to THE WIZARD OF OZ.  Have you ever been in a tornado?  I have.  Nobody's pausing to calmly and safely watch barnyard animals float by.  This movie totally trivialized that stark terror.

Whatever tires were on that pick-up truck that Bill Paxton drove around with Helen Hunt and Jamie Gertz had to be magic: somehow houses and tanker trucks could be tossed around like crazy--but not that pick-up truck!

Storywise, you can also see everything coming from a mile off.  I'll bet everyone can guess how the relationships will end within the first 20 minutes.  Characters are so broad that I wondered if the two groups of scientists were in this movie or if they were the two competing summer camps in MEATBALLS.  Of course the bad scientists--and they're bad because they drive new black vehicles--are going to suffer the most at the hands of nature.  Of course the leads will have their happy ending.  Of course the tornado will strike the drive-in movie theatre when Jack Nicholson sticks his face through the door in the clip from THE SHINING (I knew that was going to happen as soon as they showed the movie marquee).

If this movie had Jerry Bruckheimer or Michael Bay's name in the credits, I wouldn't be able to be so critical.  I just expected more from Michael Crichton.",1210118400,,1985,4.6685878962536025

I often joke that the only lines in the movie that make any sense are 'Go to the bathroom now, you may not get a chance on the road."" And that is fairly accurate (both about the movie and about one of the greatest challenges in stormchasing). But unlike most Summer action films this one at least tried its best to be realistic. They did use some phrases in hopelessly wrong contexts, and they often made up their own phrases when it moved the dialog along, but then this is Hollywood. What can you expect.

That said, this was a fun film the first time, and we have watched it in the van while chasing many times, mostly for amusement. The effects are very good, and the cast is wonderful.

On the surface, this is a good, fun, exciting film.  The special effects will certainly please anybody who likes special effects.  Good comedy, witty dialogue, and a gripping story with lots of conflicts makes the movie even more watchable.  At its core, this is also a good drama about an estranged couple trying to get back together.  At times, this drama makes the film a little tedious.

2498093,4,B000E5KJDE,"This film is not high cinematic art. It was intended to be a summer blockbuster ""put your brain on hold"" action film when it was released in 1996, and that is what it was and still is. Its competition at the time was ""Independence Day"", which is an unwatchably hokey movie, and this movie is better than that film in that it is a watchably hokey movie. Helen Hunt and Bill Paxton play recently divorced storm chasers Jo and Bill Harding whose relationship was pulled apart by Jo's obsession with chasing tornadoes to the exclusion of wanting any kind of ""normal family life"" by Bill's definition. Bill has moved on and found a more conventional girl that he plans to marry (Jami Gertz). However, before he can move on, Bill needs Jo to sign some papers. He meets her ""in the field"" as she and her team from the university plan a day of chasing tornadoes through Oklahoma. Before they can conclude their business a storm calls the team to the chase, and Bill is drawn into the chase by necessity but kept there by his latent passion - for storm-chasing and maybe even for the marriage he left behind. The film features some great special effects, fast-paced action, and cringingly obvious dialogue with the subtlety of a sledgehammer. However if you're just in the mood for an action-packed film with a feel-good after effect, this movie fits the bill.

A popular internet film database ranks this film as 5.9 out of 10. That is probably correct if you are comparing it with Casablanca. If you judge it as an action film against other action films, I'd say it's probably more of a 7 out of 10. The following are the special features:

I had absolutely no interest in Twister until I saw it was on late one boring night.  Having nothing better to do, I obliged the television and payed attention.  I found Twister to be what I call a nice bedtime movie.  While it failed to anthropomorphize the tornado the way Backdraft successfully did with fire, the characters were well fleshed out, there was a healthy balance of comedy, drama and (at the time) cutting edge special FX.  I found that as long as the viewer came in with no expectation, Twister would be a fun and easy to watch nappy time movie, perfect for watching on a rainy day, curled up with a blanket.  So to sum everything up, don't expect an epic, emotionally charged extravaganza, but if you are willing to accept a decently woven story with reasonably believable characters, and have a rainy afternoon to kill, check out Twister.  You shouldn't be too disappointed.",1181779200,,1053,4.593582887700535

Twister is an action movie with a little romance and comedy thrown in, but it's really the relationship between the main two characters and the fun dialogue between all that make you want to watch this over and over again.

I remember being surprised (when first I saw it) by the quality of the story, and the acting, and those also stand up on review.  I mention this because there've been a lot of movies that I remembered as being good that have not stood up to the test of time.  Three of the four leads are at least as good as I remembered, and Jami Gertz's performance is even better.

The DVD includes a commentary by director Jan deBont (who used to be a cinematographer) and the special effects supervisor.  It added to my appreciation of the film, but focuses (ouch) almost exclusively on visual aspects of the film.

2498110,5,B000E5KJDE,"Over the years, people have grown tired of natural disaster movies.  Why?  Because they all appear to be the same.  Here's an example of a typical storyline- everything starts out nice and calm, the story focuses on one family, the family starts having problems and they split up, and then a volcano, tornado, hurricane, or whatever hits, and all the family members somehow miraculously avoid the incredible danger JUST so they can be together again and make up with each other by the end of the movie.

Well, that kind of typical storyline isn't featured here.  Twister is truly a classic.  It's not ordinary, either.  It's about a group of tornado chasers who, as you guessed, drive around speeding through the country in an attempt to get never-before-seen film of a twister, up close and personal.

This means the film delivers the most amazing action I have honestly ever seen in a tornado movie.  Twister is definitely better than most of the similar type of films, and I remember in 1996 how influential this movie was.  I was in 9th grade, and the science teacher played Twister for the class a couple times throughout the year because it was SO good and much better than other tornado films.

Helen Hunt plays a magnificent role.  She is so obsessed with her love of twisters that she barely seems to care about the divorce she's going through.  What's great about this is that, despite giving us a really good story about a divorce, this doesn't interfere with all the tornado action.  There are *so* many good scenes in Twister that show the devastation tornadoes are capable of that it's simply amazing to me how much time and energy had to happen to make this movie.

Favorite scenes?  Well, everyone seems to love the cows floating in the air, so I won't pick that one.  I really liked the part where the twister ripped through the outside movie theater, tearing the big screen to shreds as the people quickly ran away to try and get away from it.  That's just one of MANY awesome scenes.

The storyline is really good too.  It's not just a story about a divorce between Helen and her husband.  There's a lot more to it than that.  It's complicated because the new girlfriend of the husband shows up and gets involved in all sorts of tornado action (against her will).

This is such an awesome movie.  I highly recommend it.  Tornado movies don't GET any better than this.  Pure action from beginning to end.  You will be glued to your television screen hoping the tornado chasers manage to escape the devastating danger.  Twister will make you think twice if you're thinking about becoming a tornado chaser.",1162598400,,2622,4.665938864628821

Top notch in my opinion and hollywood has not turned out many movies any better than ""Twister"". Definately an addition to my list of all time favorites. You probably won't ever want to live in Oklahoma after seeing this film. I recommend this one to anyone looking for a good entertaining film.

From the very beginning, the movie grabs your attention and doesn't let go until the very end. This isn't a documentary, so there are plenty of scenes presented for dramatic effect. That's ok by me. This is a fun, intense, emotional movie full of everything a disaster movie needs. Right up there with The Towering Inferno and The Poseidon Adventure, Twister will keep you in your seat, following every chase.",1149379200,,579,4.979381443298969
2498128,4,B000E5KJDE,"A lot of disaster movies tend to be sold around one thing: who's going to bite it and how grisly is it going to be? You don't go see Independence Day or Dante's Peak for compelling storylines and interesting characters, you go for carnage and mayhem and big action pieces. It's rough to say but it's kind of true, so it's odd that Twister doesn't have many onscreen deaths. It does have a lot of destruction and that's probably the main reason to see it. There is a lot of more development than most films but still, it's cool to watch.

Tornado warning systems aren't very effective, especially since tornadoes can hit with little warning time so we have stormchasers who try to take more accurate scientific measurements and hopefully design a more advanced warning system. Only we are dealing with a tornado, an incredibly destructive weather phenomena. And it doesn't help when you have your ex-wife, your soon-to-be wife plus your archrival is around.

It's always funny when you look back on effect shots and notice how much advancements have been made. Yes the effects are most impressive but also at times it looked a bit too CGI-y such as a huge tornado near the end or the debris that they pick up, such as trailers, tractors and barn roofs. But granted this is 10 years ago and it's certainly impressive to watch in action. It's also good that we don't get a whole lot of tornado stuff since it would become very boring and too same-y.

The casting is quite spot-on and I never saw a weak link in the cast, although some people might have a couple. There's a bit of plotholes now and then(or else there's a whole bunch that I never caught since I'm not a science geek). The film does need a bigger special edition than we have since there's so much that documentaries can explain yet we get commentaries and a making-of, nothing too big. It's understandable since Twister is actually the first movie ever released on DVD but it has been 10 years.

It's not dumb fun like Armageddon but it's at least likable and quite entertaining. Plus it's got flying cows and come on: how can you resist ""I gotta go, we got cows!"".",1147824000,,2128,4.5483028720626635

The story is of a young researcher of tornados played by Helen Hunt. She runs a budget operation trying to study tornados. She has invented a gizmo to actually get into the heart of the beast and get incredible amounts of data. The catch is that you have to get really close to deploy it. In competition with her is a blowhard who is well financed, arrogant and who has stolen the plans for her gizmo. Into this state of affairs comes the husband, played by Bill Paxton, who wants her to sign the papers to finalize a divorce so he can re-marry. He too is a former tornado researcher. As he tries to get her to sign the papers, he gets sucked back into storm chasing and it is practically required that he get sucked back into the marriage as well.

2498130,2,B000E5KJDE,"I watched Twister on cable and I admit I found the tornadoes fascinating, but what annoyed me about this film was the romantic sublot. Its a 'relationship in trouble' story, wherein the two leads (Bill & Jo) separated for an unknown reason and are forced back together under extremely contrived circumstances. Bill brings his fiancee to tornado alley while he tries to get his wife to sign the divorce papers. (I don't know about you, but Bill would be flying solo on that mission if I were the fiancee).  Jo procrastinates in an annoying way, forcing Bill to chase her. This was just stupid, unbelievable and extremely contrived and sets a tone of immaturity for the entire movie.

Bill's character is indecisive and unlikeable. Not only can he not make up his mind about how he feels about his wife and his new girlfriend, he treats his current fiancee like dirt, abandoning her repeatedly when she needs him to play with a bunch of overgrown college geeks. If his fiancee had a touch of class she would have dumped his you-know-what the moment he started playing footsie with the ex. For god sakes, woman buy a clue! Paxton is a jerk.

Unfortunately, because this 'romance' was prominently featured in the film it was impossible to ignore and it distracted me from the tornado goodness that I really wanted to watch.

Lastly, an F-5 twister (or any twister for that matter) has a forward motion (speed) of anywhere from 30 to 50 mph and Paxton and Hunt could have never outrun the storm, avoid debris from all directions or made it in time to tie themselves to some plumbing and hope to live.

The plot is thinner than deli-sliced meat, the acting (Helen Hunt aside) is sophomoric, and the dialog would make a saint cringe.  Now, to err on the side of the actors, there wasn't much that could be done with the dialog -- it's like the Doublemint Twins wrote it.  Everything is repeated twice ... ""Tornado at three o'clock!  Tornado at three o'clock!  I'm on it!  I'm on it!  Where's the road?  Where's the road?""  Stop the insanity, stop the insanity.  I can understand English quite well, especially when the actors are bellowing it out at 80 decibels.

Imagine ""Speed"" with worse dialog, but with more action and with less wooden acting than what Keanu Reeves delivers.

2498149,4,B000E5KJDE,"Earning more than $241-Million at the U.S. box office (and just shy of half-a-billion bucks worldwide), ""Twister"" was certainly a blockbuster hit after premiering in theaters on May 10, 1996.

I've been fond of this movie since seeing it for the first time on VHS. This DVD version tops the horrid Full-Frame VHS copy by a mile.

Sure, this film is a bit overdone in many places, I suppose. And there are enough contrivances to fill up a football stadium -- but it's still a lot of fun to watch nonetheless.

Many people have praised the tornado special effects in ""Twister"". But, in my opinion, I found most of the CGI tornado footage in the film to look a tad bit on the ""phony"" side. I think some of these tornadoes look a little ""too perfect"" to be ""real"" looking.  The majority of twisters I've seen in pictures and on video haven't really looked like these so-called ""real"" storms we see in this motion picture. The movie's twisters, while impressive and imposing, just don't look quite ""right"" if you ask me.

In addition, I found some of the sound effects during the tornado scenes to be a bit odd. The filmmakers have seemingly added some unusual-sounding noises to these windstorms. Since when do twisters emanate ""groaning"" noises? I've always heard that an approaching tornado sounds just like a freight train. I don't think there's any ""freight train"" sounds in this whole movie. The movie's storms seem to like to groan and whine; almost as if the filmmakers were attempting to make the tornadoes seem like ""living creatures"". Most curious, IMO. But, oh well... :)

The flying cows and flying tractors are probably a bit on the exaggerated side as well, but it's all in good fun -- and nobody gets hurt by the orbiting moo cows, etc., thanks to Bill Paxton's expert skills of driving directly through the center of an F4 or F5 monster tornado -- a handy skill to have in this film.

Plus: the ""flying cow"" scene is redeemed by Bill's funny line of dialogue after being warned by Jo (Helen Hunt) of a SECOND flying moo cow in the vicinity -- ""Actually, I think that was the same one."" (LOL!)

Besides the massive amounts of really windy weather that we experience in the movie, another of the main reasons this motion picture appeals to me (and remains highly re-watchable) is the sheer likeability of the film's characters. The main stars of the film (Helen Hunt, Bill Paxton) perform their tasks fairly well, but it's the secondary (supporting) characters that I really found the most engaging in ""Twister"" -- such as Jami Gertz, who plays the new woman in Paxton's life. In addition to Gertz, I really like each of the characters that make up the tornado ""chase team"", including Alan Ruck (""Rabbit"") and Philip Seymour Hoffman (""Dusty"").

The actors that were employed to represent the team of storm-chasers here seem to me to be 'just right'. That guy ""Dusty"", in fact, looks perfect for his part. He's totally believable, IMO, as the kind of sloppy-looking, off-the-wall guy who does nothing but chase funnel clouds across the landscape. He gets in a few good zingers of dialogue during the film, too.

This Warner Brothers' single-disc DVD of ""Twister"" delivers the goods very nicely. The disc contains a good-looking Anamorphic 2.35:1 Widescreen print and three different 5.1 Surround soundtracks (a DTS track, along with English 5.1 Dolby Digital and French 5.1 DD).

This movie is well-suited, I think, for the really-wide ""scope"" aspect ratio we get here (2.35:1). A nice-quality video transfer makes the movie shine on this DVD.

The DVD has some bonuses worth checking out as well. ..... There's a 2-person Audio Commentary Track, which includes participation by the film's Director (Jan de Bont). In addition to that, the disc has 2 behind-the-scenes featurettes -- ""The Making Of 'Twister' "" (run time of 13:50) and ""Anatomy Of A Twister"" (8:32). ""Anatomy"" takes us on a nice little tour showing how the special effects for the film were accomplished. For some reason, the DVD package only shows the ""Anatomy"" documentary feature, and omits the other (longer) featurette. But there *are* two separate mini-docs on the disc.

A Van Halen music video, 2 Theatrical Trailers, and some text-only ""Cast & Crew"" Notes are also included as Special Features on the DVD.

Some additional information about this DVD can be found below:

2498161,5,B000E5KJDE,"In this movie, Helen Hunt and Bill Paxton play scientists pursuing the most destructive weatherfront to sweep through mid-America's tornado alley in 50 years.

Helen Hunt stars as Jo Harding, a weather scientist who, as a young girl saw her father sucked up inside a tornado.  It is Jo's dream to develop electronic storm sensors which can be launched inside the tornado to provide data to create an improved weather warning system.  Bll Paxton stars as Bill Harding, Jo's estranged husband.  He's brought divorce papers for Jo to sign.  However, there still seems to be a spark between the two.  Both serverd as storm chasers together.  Bill has brought his uptight and jealous fiance Melissa, played wonderfully by Jami Gertz.  Melissa doesn't fit in very well with the storm chasers.  Bill is now a weatherman, having given up the stormchasing business.

Jo shows Bill ""Dorothy"", her storm sensor system which launches sensors inside a tornado.  Bill is the one who designed Dorothy originally.  The sensors bring back data such as windspeed and velocity.  The early warning system could give people as much as 15 minutes to reach safety, Jo theorizes.

Soon, the group is off chasing a storm, and Bill, realizing that he forgot his signed divorce papers, is tagging along.  The group soon encounters Jonas Miller, played by Cary Elwes, a fellow stormchaser from the same lab who received help from corporate sponsors.  Bill believes that Jonas is only in the business for the money and he refers to him as a ""nightcrawler with no instincts"".  Jonas and his group are chasing the same storm as Jo's group.  Jonas has developed his own storm system sensor called the Dot 3.  It is almost an exact copy of Dorothy.  The race is on to see who's system will work first.

A tornado is spotted, and Bill and Jo race to place Dorothy in its path, at the same time being pursued by Jonas.  Despite their arguing, Bill and Jo seem to be rekindling their romance, while Bill and Melissa are drifting further apart.  The storm flings Jo's truck into the middle of the road, destroying Dorothy, but there are still three Dorothys left.  Jonas shows up too late.  Soon, Dorothy 2 is loaded in Bill's truck, and the chase is on again.

Another tornado is spotted, but this one is much larger than the first.  Dorothy 2 is positioned, but unfortunately a telephone pole falls on it and destroys it.  Only two Dorothys are left.

Another tornado appears practically on top of the group, who have parked near a drive-in movie.  The tornados are increasing in strength, and it launches its wrath on the drive-in.  Soon, cars and other debris is hurtling through the air.  The storm passes, but the drive-in is completely destroyed.  Jo realizes that the tornado has shifted and is headed directly for her aunt's house.  Melissa, realizing that she can't compete with Jo and her crew, informs Bill that she's leaving him.  Jo and Bill reach Jo's aunt and rescue her from her destroyed house.

Another stronger tornado is forming and is said to be the strongest ever in the area.  Jo and Bill are off in pursuit.  What the group encounters is a massive funnel with a base one mile wide.  Dorothy 3 is placed in the middle of the highway, but a large tree knocks Dorothy over.  Now there's only one Dorothy left.

Meanwhile, Jonas and his group have shown up again.  They are placing their own Dot 3 machine.  Jo and Bill try to warn Jonas that the tornado may shift, but unfortunately for Jonas' group, they ignore the warning.

Bill leaves Dorothy 4 in the back of his truck, Bill and Jo jump out, and the tornado picks up the truck with Dorothy in it.  Much to their joy, Dorothy works just as she was designed to, but the danger isn't over yet.  Bill and Jo find themselves facing the wrath of the tornado on foot.  Facing gale-force winds and flying farm buildings, Bill and Jo finally take cover in a shed, tied to pipes that reach far down into the ground.  The storm passes and Bill and Jo begin planning their future research as a couple again.

This is an excellent movie.  Bill Paxton and Helen Hunt do wonderful jobs, and Jami Gertz is teriffic as Melissa.  The high point of the movie is the top-notch special effects.  They are some of the best I've ever seen.  The tornado scenes are extremely realistic.  My favorite scenes were when the semi truck loaded with diesel fuel came hurtling out of the tornado and exploded on the road, and the scene where Bill drove the pickup through the house.  I highly recommend this thrilling and action-packed movie.

2498165,3,B000E5KJDE,"I was interested to read another viewers comments about Helen Hunts character in this movie, being interested in Tornadoes, because she witnessed her father being sucked away by one as a child. This is the biggest flaw in this otherwise fairly good escapist flick. I wonder why the Hollywood moguls think we have to have these back stories and then a dreary romance effort, in the midst of carnage, much like the more recent Day After Tomorrow. Was every weatherman inspired by a lightning bolt that killed his dog? Are Lumberjacks so inspired because a tree fell on their brother? the list of possibilities is endless. This could have, and SHOULD have been a great movie. The script and story in general aren't bad, and the special effects are of course impressive. This is a movie remember, so those who want to be disparaging about the lack of similarities to ""real"" storm chasers should wake up. I for one don't want to see a movie about someone sitting in a field all day waiting for weather. That said, the movies penchant for trying to walk a middle line here (not quite disaster movie, not quite love drama) leaves BOTH areas unfulfilled. Will Helen Hunt get back with Bill Paxton? will his new fiance run away? Will they beat the much better equipped and funded competition to the punch? Will they find a ""Finger 5"" tornado? - Frankly I stopped caring. I wanted to see a movie about a Twister, and although I was expecting something predictable, this was just too much, and that's a real shame. Getting a DVD makeover means of course clearer picture and sound, and those with a 5:1 system at home will doubtless get a lot from the reproduction here. trouble is however, it won't matter how you watch it, it's still a let down - I wanted to give more but 3 Stars is a stretch, and that's mainly for the CGI.",1095897600,,1815,4.553516819571866
2498166,2,B000E5KJDE,"I think I was so disappointed in this movie precisely because I was SO looking forward to it when it first came out! I love movies and documentaries about tornadoes, but they really screwed this up bad.

  First, the storyline was idiotic. The bad guys drove around in big black trucks and hunted tornadoes for a ""corporation"" (gasp! heavens!) The colorful young assistants I wouldn't trust to change engine oil, let alone be the ones to warn people of impending danger. Then the psychology was all wrong. One of the reasons Jaws worked was because the hero was terrified of water and sharks. Hunt is all over the place; sometimes she's scared, other times she acts like she's at a water theme park (""that was fun! let's do it again!"") Meanwhile, Bill's poor fiance spends the whole movie gasping in horror. SHE should have been the naive girl who thought tornadoes would be fun, until she came up upon the really bad one at the drive-in... and then she could understand where Hunt's fear/obsession came from. Unfortunately, the writers didn't get that, or (more likely) they didn't really care.

  Second, the special effects stunk. Sorry, but when they say a tornado makes a roaring sound, they mean it roars like a train - not a dinsoaur. The most effective scene is the one at the drive-in, and that's because you don't see the tornado - like the opening scene of Jaws where all you see is the terror of the girl swimmer, as opposed to the fake shark opening and closing its mouth later on.

  It is fun, however, to count the editing mistakes. First it's a dirt road, then it's a busy highway; first the windshield is broken, the next second it's miraculously fixed. By the way, I want that guy's truck; talk about taking a licking and keeping on ticking! It goes through a house, but still looks like it came off the showroom floor. And after actually having a F-5 go RIGHT OVER THEM, they just sit there, like ""cool"". No awe, no wonder.
  And by the way, why was she raised by her aunt, if her mother survived the tornado? That made no sense. But since nothing much else in this movie did, that's okay.

  See Twister for the drive-in scene, and the last scenes in the barn/cornfield. Sorry to say, the rest was pretty bad.

  By the way, the second star is for the scene where Hunt asks ""Where's my truck?"" and when it is hurled out of the tornado and smashes down yards from her, she deadpans ""oh, there it is.""

  Darn, what could have been...",1094860800,,2453,4.506787330316742

The characters themselves are annoying and you actually wish they'll die because who in the hell is dumb enough to chase a tornadoe anyway ? lol. Bill Paxton plays a guy who can sense when a tornadoe is coming and when it's gonna strike when I heard that's not possible. Helen Hunt plays a nutball who's obsessed with chasing a tornadoe because one killed her father when she was little. Paxton and Hunt try hard but their roles are dumb as is the script. Also annoying in supporting roles are Philip Seymour Hoffman ""who's a much better actor now and Jamie Gertz (Lost Boys) as Paxton's g/f. The Tornadoe itself is what makes the movie worth watching.

 Other than some brief moments of special effects, this movie has absolutely no creativity or imagination whatsoever. The script and story line formulas are so generic that they were probably taken out of a textbook. Helen Hunt and Bill Paxton play two white trash tornado chasers engaged in a shouting contest of stupid one-liners such as ""Now!"", ""Let's go!"", ""Move!"", ""Yeah!"" to the point you'd actually think you're with a drunken crowd at a football game.

While watching this movie, it became clear to me that ""actors"" are people who have been randomly selected to get in front of a camera and pretend to do things.  The characters say things like, ""these satellite readings have increased in the last ten minutes""  ""Keep monitoring this pattern""  ""Ok""  Then there is a tossing aside of sodas and a melee of excited, riot-like running toward vehicles.  Then there is more dialog, like ""We're not going to be able to intercept!""  ""No, we will. Hang on!""  ""Are you out of your mind?""
""We gotta get outta here!""  ""I know!""  This last dialog is screamed over the sound of lots of wind.

2498172,4,B000E5KJDE,"I have had interest in the concept of severe weather for my entire life and had high expectations for the movie ""Twister"" and the result cuts boths ways for me.
 The movie is of a married meteoroligist couple who are in the midst of getting a divorce, and have not gotten along for a very long time and they make a new invention that they believe will help them see what it looks like, inside a full blown tornado. They have ambition to deploy this new technology to disperse 'lighter than air' radio transmitters into a twister and record the signals to see what it may look like inside a tornado.
 The special effects when the tornadoes strike are absolutely awesome not to mention the chase scenes especially towards the ending when the couple speed away from a tornado drive right through a house that was thrown onto the countryside road by a tornado (Impossible in real life) and the other of when a drive-in movie screen showing a snippet of the movie ""The Shining"" being ripped apart by a F5 tornado in the middle of the night.
 ""Twister"" though suffers from several things and I can sometimes see where some of the detractors are coming from when regarding this movie. While the action scenes and special effects are amazing, the movie's plot lacks a good flow and the film drags on and on in several places and one scene which is just like a boring day at home would've been better left out altogether. Plus the characters are very unconvincing and lack personality.
 Even for me who doesn't mind ocassional deviation from the laws of physics in movies, some of the tornadoe scenes are completely unrealistic. For example as I said earlier in a review, there is no way a twister could fling a whole house across a countryside road or even roll the whole intact house across the countryside because most houses are built on foundations and strong tornadoes in real life  would shed houses into tiny pieces or otherwise reduce them to ruin. An F5 tornado would leave nothing of a house behind and can even rip the pavement off a road if the conditions warrant. \
 This movie is nonetheless worth watching just for the tornadoes alone but this movie could have been a lot better than it turned out to be. While having it's share of flaws Roland Emmerich's ""The Day After Tomorrow"" is far superior on many levels and corrects a lot of the flaws of ""Twister"" in my opinion.",1088380800,,2378,4.570422535211268
2498173,4,B000E5KJDE,"From the minds of Michael Crichton and Steven Spielberg, Twister has a tornado instead of a T-Rex.  The score even reminds you of Jurassic Park.  But despite this, Twister is a real nail-biter.  I started out watching it sitting on the couch, and ended up on the floor closer to the screen at the end.  The weather effects are amazing - and scary.  The tornados are real-looking, but so are the sky, the clouds, the wind, and the mood - which hooks you in.
The romance between tornado-chaser Jo (Helen Hunt) and Bill (Bill Paxton), is predictable, but it is still interesting to see how it unfolds.  CSI's Jamie Gertz plays the third-wheel fiancee, trailing along in hot pursuit of the storms because Jo is still sitting on the divorce papers.  Her refined, Southern character is funny in contrast to Hunt's boot-stomping, full-throttle lifestyle.
Helen Hunts leads a huge pack of nerds who compromise her tornado-chasing team.  It is interesting to note that Hunt is the only attractive woman in the film.  It was like the casting agent deliberately surrounded her with unattractive women.  Even her mother as a little girl is a big, beefy, homely farm woman, and her father is a typical redneck.  How such a pretty girl could come from them, I don't know.  One of my favorite characters is Jo's aunt.  She is very unique.",1087776000,,1323,4.724890829694323

2498177,5,B000E5KJDE,"This movie must have gotten Storm Chasers a real boost.  Just as more and more videos of twisters appeared on nightly TV in the 90s this movie came out.
One thing this movie is though it is an great introduction, in a bit of a farcical way to the science of tornados.  This season of twisters has been very devastating and with so many storm chasers today, there are even what they call 'chaser jams' as the cars load the roads.  Unlike the competition in the movie for who will get the best view, there is a courtesy.
However, this movie has great special effects, the cow in the air scene was somewhat comical.  Touching was the scene of the destruction of a friends house, and horrifying was the scene just prior to it of a twister hitting a drive-in theater.
Hunt and Paxton work together well in this movie.  The attempt to outrun the category 5 at the end was a bit unreal, yet you are on the edge of your seat as the 1/2 a mile wide funnel gets ever closer.

And the icing on the cake?The great soundtrack(Van Halen, Rusted root, Goo Goo Dolls) which is highlighted by the song, ""Twisted,"" written for this movie by rock legend, Ms. Stevie Nicks, and performed by Stevie Nicks her ex lover(and re-united Fleetwood Mac member), Mr. Lindsey Buckingham!!WOW!

2498191,4,B000E5KJDE,"Some movies are made as excused to play with special effects, which is a pretty good explanation for ""Twister.""  This film was basically sold to the American public on the basis of two special effects shots in the trailer: a tornado demolishing a barn plank by plank and a tire heading right through a windshield at the camera.  The latter was not in the film, but that was beside the point.  In 1939 Arnold Gillespe used a stocking to terrify children for the rest of the century with the tornado in ""The Wizard of Oz.""  In 1996 ""Twister"" intended to up the ante with computerized effects (of course there are lots of homages to the previous film, with ""Dorothy"" being the name of the tornado device that measures the wind speeds of the tornado and the cow blowing around in the air just like what Dorothy saw out her window when her twister lifted up the house).
Director Jan de Bont was making his second film after the smash hit ""Speed,"" so basically he needed some action.  But the script by Michael Crichton and Anne-Marie Martin decides to overload the script with melodramatic elements.  Helen Hunt plays Dr. JoAnne ""Jo"" Thorton-Harding, who has been chasing tornadoes ever since the night one of them took her daddy away.  Her scientific purpose is to study them so that meterologists can make more accurate predictions and warn people in time to save lives, but obviously she has deep psychological demons driving her as well.  This is one of the reasons that her husband, William Harding (Bill Paxton) is trying to get her to sign divorce papers.  He is hoping to build a new life with Dr. Melissa Reeves (Jamie Gertz), but being able to study tornadoes in peace without Jo going crazy would be nice too.  But if Helen Hunt wants to see what the inside of a tornado looks like, then that is what she should get to do.  Besides, even Melissa knows that Jo and Bill still love each other.
If this was not enough to give a whole new dimension to what is already an exciting proposition (these people want to chase tornadoes; what more do you need to get excited about in a movie?), the script sets up the ""good"" tornado chasers, including Philip Seymour Hoffman as Dustin Davis and Alan Ruck as Robert ""Rabbit"" Nurick, and the ""bad"" tornado chasers, led by Dr. Jonas Miller (Cary Elwes), who is more interested in corporate sponsorship and television specials than in the holy grail of pure scientific research.  The ""bad"" guys even drive black vehicles in precision formations, while the ""good"" guys drive vehicles that each have to have at least 100,000 miles on them.
Consequently we have personal and professional circumstances that drive these people to put themselves in the path of oncoming hurricanes, which is, ultimately, the whole point of the movie.  ""Twister"" is not about a single hurricane, but several, all apparently different, with the biggest and baddest of them all, the Level 5 ""Finger of God,"" coming at the end.  You have to be impressed that not only our hero and heroine survive these tornadoes, but that the script manages to make it reasonable that their lives are imperiled repeatedly in this film.  That is what makes this a fun film, because even if the plot is on the level of a theme park ride, the special effects come fast and furious.  Just think Tornadoes 5 (three levels of meaning there, people), Plot 3, and ""Twister"" grades out at a 4.
Final Note: At some point in the past the ratings board decided that saying a movie was PG-13 was not enough information for warning parents.  The PG-13 rating for ""Twister"" is ""for intense depiction of very bad weather.""  I leave you to ponder what a film would have to show in terms of bad weather to warrant an R rating (or higher).",1083369600,,3719,4.634703196347032
2498192,4,B000E5KJDE,"Some time ago I had the chance to see the movie Twister.  This is a movie about some tornado chasers and the biggest storm system on record.
A group of tornado chasers are out to test a new device that will provide researches with enough data to give a fifteen-minute tornado warning (as opposed to the current three-minute warning).  There is a rush to succeed as an evil associate with lots of funding has stolen the idea and is out to get the data first.  Throw in some special effects tornados and the result is Twister.
On the side of the good guys is a researcher who has an almost-psychic link with tornados and is thus able to predict their paths better than any instruments.  But then you have the common problem of scale that occurs when special effects are added to live footage.  Half-a-mile looks pretty small in this film.  Half-a-mile is the supposed diameter of the film's final funnel cloud.  Unlike Crichton's other films of this nature, the scientific breakthrough is not lost at the end and therefore the film fails to fit the real world.  But despite these things, this is a edge-of-the-seat, white-knuckle film.  If you like action and tension then this is a film to see.  While, in my opinion, the story is very implausible, the movie succeeds in affecting the audience as planned and that is a rare thing.

But though I am Japanese, I am very interested to the nature phenomenons so that have gotten to Japanese weather forecast licence. The person like me will have many interests to watch this movie.
In fact, in Japan the tornades do not break out. But hurricane(Japanese name Taifuu) is very important disasters in Japan. Certainly Taifuu is bad things that break the disaster, but on the other hand, as Tifuu approached to Tokyo(my address) I used to have felt the excitments. Though it is not the apt remark, I can understand the cast feeling of this movie that as tornads approach to their site, they get the exitements.
When the people that are not interested to such phenomenons look at the person that dive into the tornads without the caution to oneself life, may be you will think that such person is crazy. But I can understand the emotion of the person that dive into little. Especialy in Japan it is famouse thing that very storong Taifuu approach. Now even when I involve to such situations, I care to such scale or wind speed, the pressure etc.
This movie may lack as the point of the story, and for the veteran movie watcher such movies lacking the story may be no. But if watch in the pure point that enjoy the exciting phenomenons and so on honestly, the movie may be good thing.

I didn't care for DeBont's previous film, 'Speed' either-substitute stunts for decent plot in that one.  The whole premise of 'Twister' is bogus:  stormchasers run around after tornadoes, with the leader's (Bill Paxton) difficulties with his wife (Helen Hunt) as a sorry subplot.  The chasers conveniently manage to run into several tornadoes in a very short period of time, which is pretty farfetched.  Real stormchasers will tell you it is very difficult indeed to get close to a single funnel cloud, let alone a bunch of them as portrayed in this film. This movie is evidence that filmgoer objectivity is deteriorating along with the product; if audiences consider this a 'great' movie, it means they don't think of plot and acting as really important-only trees, cows, etc. flying around via CGI effects.  If you want to see a really good movie about a natural disaster, try 'The River' with Mel Gibson and Sissy Spacek-it has decent acting along with the destruction.",1077667200,,1146,4.968586387434555

Jami Gertz takes on the role of the ""third wheel"" in the relationship, the part played by Ralph Bellamy 60 years ago.

2498196,5,B000E5KJDE,"OK, I've read the other reviews...I think ""Twister"" is entertaining, with great CGI effects. The plot is intense, and most sub-plots are silly. Helen Hunt is beautiful, and quite a good actress. Bill Paxton is customarily hammy. Still I enjoy this film as entertainment. It's interesting to note that a lot of our current best actors today got a start in this film. Philip Seymour Hoffman, in particular, shows great flair, as well as Jeremy Davies, playing the wimp. Director Jan de Bont seems to use Alan Ruck a lot, and for good reason: He's talented. I was disappointed when Jamie Gertz won the Razz Award as ""Worst Supporting Actress"" in '96. I thought she gave a fine performance...her character was written to be reactionary, and I thought her every nuance was touching and sincere. As far as writing, well, some of the soap opera stuff could've been cut short. Jan de Bont, with all the films he could've chosen, showed scenes from Kubrick's ""The Shining"" (at the drive-in), and Cukor's ""A Star is Born"" (before Aunt Meg's house is blown away). If these are homages, he has good taste. And Lois Smith was solid as the aunt; I've liked her since she played Nicholson's sister in ""Five Easy Pieces"". A fine character actress. With this stuff in mind, I watch ""Twister"" often, and enjoy it each time. Why be so analytical? It was made as mass-marketed entertainment and, on that level, it succeeds.

2498198,4,B000E5KJDE,"Twister is a film that I first saw in high school, and going into seeing it I had some doubts.  Truth is, I was highly entertained.  I really had a fun time watching this movie.  *sigh* Alas, it's another movie that had great potential to be a five star film but underachieved.
The plot of Twister is very simple, but applicable, you can follow it and I think the plot and storyline were well defined in this movie.  It's basically about Tornado Chasers who are trying to make history by finding a way to learn more about them.  It's an ingenius idea they come up with, don't know how real it is though.
The characters in this film are quite entertaining.  I think Helen Hunt and Bill Paxton play off each other quite well.  Bill Paxton's character, Bill, is a weatherman who seems to have a nose for storms (human barometer).  Helen Hunt plays Jo, the soon to be Ex-wife of Bill's.  Jo is rather obsessed about this idea of theirs, called Dorothy, because she lost her father in a tornado.  So right away, both characters have an interest, a purpose to the storyline which I really liked.
As far as the other characters go, they have either small parts or they are meant for comic relief, but do little to contribute to the plot.
You have Jonas, the rival to Bill and Jo's party, who steals their ideas and is rather a cheap skate all together.
Then you have Dusty, who's uglier than sin, but is a funny guy and I liked his character.  I failed to really see the contribution of his character, however, at least as far as how he aids to the team.
Then you have Melissa, the soon to be new wife for Bill, who is a therapist who stupidely tags along and while finding herself in these life and death situations constantly is on the phone to a client.  Her character wasn't really needed, other than for comic relief.  She's always a step behind everyone else, and the movie attempted to portray her as an air head or some naive city girl with no clue about storms.  Again, her character was worthless other than the humor she indirectly brings.
And there's a bunch of other guys part of this Storm Team under Jo and Bill that really don't have much of a part at all, other than witty comments here and there and little bits of advice and information they just happen to share.
To be blunt, Jo and Bill pretty much hog this film.  The other characters are...well...just kinda there.  I think it would've been great if the movie had just severed out Melissa's character all together and give the other Tornado chasers more time so we at least know who they are and why they are vital to this team.  Because for the most part, you don't really learn any of their names but Dusty's.
This shying away from the other characters is one of the reasons why it lost a star, the other is that this film had almost too many unreal parts in it.
Unreal part 1: Jo and Bill huddle under an old wooden bridge together as a tornado blows directly over them.  No sir, that bridge would be ripped to shreds and so would they.  Unreal.
Unreal part 2: Jo, Bill, and Melissa get cut off by two sister twisters who spin around their truck, making the truck spin around on the road, but doesn't get damaged, doesn't get thrown around.  This was pretty bad, because I don't think this was even close to real.
Unreal part 3: Jo and Bill's truck gets stuck on a branch and can't move, while the tornado slings a gas truck at them.  The gas truck hits them, dislodging them from the branch.  Later the gas truck blows up in front of them and they drive through the flames.  OK, a gas truck semi hits them and it just spins them free?  No, I think it would do more than dislodge them.  And driving through gasoline flames?  Uh-uh, if any of those flames hit your gas tank you're history.  Too unreal.
Unreal part 4: Jo and Bill out run a tornado on foot.  Then they anchor themselves to a well and while being sucked into the air, they look up and see the center of the twister.  Um, I don't think it's even remotely possible to out run a twister on foot.  And I don't think you could look up into a tornado because I think there would be so much dust, you wouldn't be able to see.
So, despite all these unrealalities that take place in this movie, it's still quite entertaining.  Unrealism doesn't bother me unless there's an abundance of it.  At least the characters recognized they were lucky, and didn't get away with these unreals because they were skilled.
On the plus side:
1. Pretty good acting, with some cliche parts and lines.
2. Very suspenseful
3. Awesome sound and special effects, can follow the sequences of the action all right.
4. Great storyline and plot, with sub plots that present challenge to each of the main characters.
5. Drama and action mix well in this.
6. It does provide some education on twisters and how they form, what they are, the classes of twisters, and the different types.
7. Helen Hunt is stunning in this *wink*
So overall, this is a film worth owning.  It's entertaining, it's fun, it's a pretty good disaster film considering it.  My only complaints, and what brought it down to four stars, is the lack of involvement in other characters and an abundance of unreal parts that almost took away the credibility of this film; as far as how much Hollywood really knows about twisters or how much they really cared about being accurate.
See this film, you should enjoy it, but I think you'll agree with me when I say this film could've been even better.  But it's good enough.

2498199,4,B000E5KJDE,"There are three stars in ""Twister"": the obsessed, almost vindictive woman who wants to defeat tornadoes, the obsessed, ingenious man determined to thwart tornadoes with technology - and the American Corn Belt, where superfluous humans and their artifacts are scrubbed from the landscape every year by tornadoes. Although they're not alone in chasing twisters, the Paxton/Hunt team is the focus of the movie - and this team is no bunch of Evian-swilling Sierra Club wimps. One of the best scenes shows the team stopping for a quick (feast) of steak, eggs, mashed potatoes, and gravy (""Meg's gravy is famous - it's practically a food group"") at Hunt's character's aunt's home, right slap in the middle of Tornado Alley. The professional camaraderie in this team is wonderful, especially when we see how the members of the other team (led by Cary Elwes) don't get along so much as they get in line. (Critic Emerson will probably be played by Elwes the same way, if anyone ever makes a movie of his life.) By the way, I bought a copy of the soundtrack album - and then threw it away: none of the wonderful, driving original music is on the CD!",1060732800,,1139,4.728643216080402
2498230,3,B000E5KJDE,"I didn't much care for this film when I first saw it on broadcast TV, but the DTS version blew me away (along with the twisters).  The special effects in DTS more than made up for the mediocre acting and rather inane plot.  I didn't much care if the actors survived the tornadoes or not.  Maybe when I watch it again, I will not be quite as taken away by the effects and return to disliking the film.",1059868800,,400,4.102564102564102
2498231,2,B000E5KJDE,"Like ""The Perfect Storm,"" another Hollywood blockbuster about extremely bad weather,  ""Twister"" gives us a script that it wouldn't have taken an F5 tornado to demolish. Add a nonstop series of lapses in credibility (e.g., some poor trucker in an 18-wheeler gets sucked into the monster funnel cloud, but Helen Hunt and Bill Paxton sidle right up alongside killer tornadoes repeatedly, and get nothing worse than a bruise) and some of the clunkiest dialog ever to boom out of multichannel sound systems, and the result is a movie that makes you grateful for the fast-forward and skip-chapter buttons on a DVD player. To be fair, the storm scenes are pretty entertaining, if not nearly as scary or realistic-looking as they could've been. (It's not that the CGI effects aren't convincing; it's that the neatly composed and precisely staged tornado sequences don't compare to the shaky, grainy, sometimes chaotic real-life TV news footage that the Weather Channel recycles for ""Storm Stories"" and such.) And the DVD is a terrific workout for a home-theatre setup, especially the subwoofer.  Unfortunately, the storm scenes take up maybe a half-hour of a two-hour movie, so the remaining 90 minutes is a workout of your patience for bad dialog and bad line readings (Philip Seymour Hoffman excepted).

Then when you go the distance and take notice of how awful the acting and storyline are, you have a rude awakening. The word to describe this film is 'annoying'. The acting is annoying. The forever worn out and severly lame 'Lover's-Quarrel-But-Everyone-Gets-Back-Together-In-The-End' sub plot is annoying. The 'bad guys' driving black vehicles and having that ever politically incorrect 'corporate backing' (how dare they?!) is annoying. The one liners are annoying. The fact that every tornado is refered to as 'she' or 'her' is annoying. The fact that the homemade weather station named 'Dorothy' is refered to as 'she' or 'her' is annoying. The final scene with the main characters tying themselves up inside a decrepit shack and end up flying around safely inside an F-5 tornado is annoying. Bill Paxton's rotten acting and 'intense' monotone voice (who told this guy he could act?) plus Helen Hunt's usual terrible acting are annoying. The scene where everyone freezes and look at each other when the reference to an 'F-5 tornado' is mentioned and is refered to as 'The Finger Of God' is annoying. Trucks driving through houses, the main 'bad guy' getting sucked up into the F-5 after ignoring Paxton's warnings, Bill Paxton telling Helen Hunt that he is still in love with her while his 'wife to be' hears the conversation over the CB radio, Helen Hunt's 'death Wish' by confronting each tornado, one of the professional storm chasers deciding to take cover in a truck while a tornado is coming (even I know not to do that!), the little plastic piece of junk 'sensors' rigged with sliced up soda cans for propellers being sucked up into the tornado and are not pulverized, the fact that all the domestic animals that are shown somehow survive (Hollywood seems to have no problem showing people being mauled but heaven forbid a down home pet gets wiped out), the fact that the scene following the destruction of the drive in theater in Wakita is not included (was it ever shot?) are all ANNOYING! Good points: opening scene where the Helen Hunt character's father is sucked into an F-5 tornado, tornado destroying the drive in theater, 18 wheeler being thrown at the main characters truck, the final tornado wiping out a large barn and the 5.1 surround sound. Based on these points alone, I give this film two points. A note to the producers for a follow up: Do your science homework.

2498234,4,B000E5KJDE,"First motion picture on DVD.
It was incredible and awesome to watch this film in a movie theater.  The first of its kind and the high-upgrade in special effects is mind-boggling.  To see the movie tornadoes in a theater from ceiling to bottom (well you know what I mean) was breath-taking.  They did try to add some sense of humor every now and then (the cow). Shown in squeezy widescreen. I know some people that just will not watch this film because it is too real for them.  The only thing I disliked about this film is, the soundman did not turn up the sound on the K.D. Lang song (heard when Hunt is at the diner with the drive-in in backgroud).  You can barely hear her wonderful ballad.  I also disliked the rock & roll music at the end credits.  TRIVIA: Did you know that one of the writers of this film, Anne-Marie Martin, played ""Gwen Davies"" (1982-85) on the NBC serial ""Days Of Our Lives""?  She was also in PROM NIGHT (1980) and HALLOWEEN II (1981).  This DVD includes in Special Effects, Audio Commentary with Director, Jan De Bont and Special Effects Coordinator, Stefen Fangmeier.  A featurette nearly 14 minutes long on ""The Making Of Twister"".  Here you will see how they made fake storms, filming in real storms approaching, videos of real tornadoes, how they made a set that was seven blocks long of destruction and much more.  ""An Anatomy of the Twister"" is an 8-minute featurette is mostly about the over 300 special effects for the film.  How they made the tornadoes look so realistic.  Each tornado created had a character of its own.  Two original theatrical trailers and info on cast and crew are also available.  The music video ""Humans Being"" by Van Halen can be played.  I wish they added the song ""Love Affair"" by K.D. Lang to the DVD.

2498236,4,B000E5KJDE,"If ever a film was made to perpetuate the stereotype of Oklahoma as a state mercilessly and relentlessly ravaged by tornadoes, TWISTER is it.  As a resident of Oklahoma, I can assure the readers of this review of two things:  1) tornadoes do on occasion occur here; and 2) tornadoes do not come in endless waves, one after another, like some sort of demented assembly line.
Having said this, TWISTER is a remarkably entertaining film.  It's a fasten-your-seatbelt, get-ready-to-duck, leave-both-hands-inside-the-car rollercoaster ride, complete with eye-popping, hair-raising special effects.  This movie is a vivid feast for the eyes:  menacing, swirling tornadoes of various shapes and sizes; flying cows; and an endless assortment of storm debris to block the path of our protagonists, from tractors to tanker trucks--even houses.
The plot plays second fiddle to the action and special effects.  Thank goodness:  if the plot had to carry this film, the movie would have collapsed into a sappy and contrived love story.  From the very beginning of the film, when meteorologist Bill Harding (Bill Paxton) locates his estranged stormchasing wife Dr. JoAnne Thornton-Harding (Helen Hunt) out on the northern Oklahoma plains and asks her to sign divorce papers, the viewer instantly realizes:  the couple, eventually, will get back together.  Thankfully, Mother Nature takes over and the film takes off. Paxton and Hunt are solid in their performances, yet Philip Seymour Hoffman steals the show, as techno-goofy, slightly off-center Dusty Davis, a member of JoAnne's stormchasing team.  If anyone can have a good time in the face of oncoming disaster, it's Dusty (who refers to a tornado's swath of destruction as ""the suck zone"").
Director Jan de Bont delivers nonstop action like a swirling wall cloud; TWISTER is nervous energy unleashed, a cacophony of sights and sounds that keeps the adrenaline flowing.",1049414400,,1908,5.3478260869565215

2498238,3,B000E5KJDE,"Like others, I was horrified to witness the convoluted, ""spiraling out of control"" spectacle of Helen Hunt and Bill Paxton dribbling on and on about their silly relationship. Far more deadly than any tornado I've seen. Not to mention that I had forgotten just how bad Phillip Seymour Hoffman could be. By the way, is this now the standard criterion for cheeseball Hollywood flicks - the resident staple disheveled wacko techno nerd? Personally, I don't need this character unless he's pulled off with aplomb (like the brilliant Steve Buscemi (sp?))
The major problem with movies like this (that are action or disaster packed) is that one would like to be pulling for the humans and wanting them to survive, instead of pulling for the disaster to sweep them all away. Yes, the special effects were sometimes fun...
One could blame it all on the bad script writing - which is surely justified - but Paxton is such a goofball that he probably would have flucked up a solid script.
I give it three stars for the visuals and sound when the actors were not speaking.",1045267200,,1060,4.735135135135135
2498239,4,B000E5KJDE,"It says right on the cover of the DVD that Twister is a project from the producers of ""Jurassic Park"", which is fitting considering that the only difference between that movie and ""Twister"" is that the dinosaurs are replaced with tornadoes.  Oh, and this movie has a flying cow that just might put a smile on your face.
This is the story of two scientists named Bill and JoAnne Harding, played by Bill Paxton and Helen Hunt, respectively.  They were once married to each other, but now in the process of divorcing.  Bill and his new fianc, Melissa (Jami Gertz), go to see JoAnne to pick up the legal documents that will finalize their divorce.  While they're with JoAnne and her research crew they get news of some tornado activity in the vicinity.  Bill and JoAnne had devised this machine called the ""Dorothy"" which was supposed to help measure the intensity inside the middle of a tornado, and they figure that these tornados will give them a chance to see if their machine actually works.  The next thing you know, everybody is chasing after and running away from tornados, all in an effort to test out their machine, as well as compete against a ""rival"" group of scientists who have copied the machine's design and created a similar device of their own.
There's also a subplot involving the budding love triangle between Bill, JoAnne, and Melissa.  Though they're divorcing, Bill and JoAnne still have deep feelings for each other, much to the chagrin of Melissa.  However, in relation to the grand scheme of this movie, this subplot is awkward and simply doesn't work.  The audience is made to believe that this group of scientists is risking their lives in pursuit of a scientific breakthrough.  It seems silly for Melissa to be questioning the feelings that her fianc might have for his ex-wife.
Just as in ""Jurassic Park"", the story line of this movie is pretty weak.  The only reason to see the movie is for its outstanding visual effects.  This is a movie that would be fun to see on a big screen TV.  I'm disappointed that I didn't go see it when it first came out in theaters.  While the plot is [simple], the cinematography, art direction, and special effects more than make up for it.  I recommend this movie.",1043107200,,2224,4.6521739130434785

You'll find yourself watching this movie over and over just like I do all the time! It's a great addition to any DVD collection. The interactive menus are really cool. I love the making of Twister feature that shows how they brought the monstrous tornados to life. It's pretty freaky but luckily I don't live in Kansas or anywhere near it.

2498242,5,B000E5KJDE,"I remember seeing this film in the theater when it first came out, and I was totally blown away.  Twister ranks among the best of the disaster films that I have ever seen.  Bill Paxton and Helen Hunt turn in stellar performances as Jo and Bill, an estranged couple who are in the process of a divorce when they are suddenly thrown back together in pursuit of the most violent series of tornadoes to hit mid-America in 50 years.  In working together both are forced to confront some of their own inner demons, especially the ones that drove them apart in the first place.
Of course, no movie is any good without a strong supporting cast, and Twister has that in spades.  From Philip Seymour Hoffman as Dusty on down to Lois Smith as Jo's Aunt Meg, these actors do a heck of a lot more than serve as backdrop to Jo and Bill.  They help to enhance the story, each in their own way.
What I liked best about Twister was the fact that I found it to be a very intellectual film, much like The Day After.  Although to some it may seem to be mostly a Jo and Bill story on the surface, I found myself doing a lot of ""what if"" thinking in regards to any disaster, natural OR manmade, after seeing it.  I couldn't help but ask myself just how I'd react in the face of oncoming disaster, what steps I'd take to avoid getting myself or others hurt or killed, things like that.  This, I believe, is a key ingredient in any successful disaster film--the ability to make you think about how'd you react under the very same circumstances.
All in all, I consider Twister to be among the most superior disaster films ever made.  Loaded with awesome acting, superb special effects, and a great story, this is a film that is definitely worth owning!",1039564800,,1727,4.355140186915888
2498243,4,B000E5KJDE,"This was a good movie. Intriguing storyline, impressive cast, believable (and likable) characters, plenty of excitement, and even a subplot of romance. Admittedly, not all of the ""very bad weather"" that earned it the PG-13 rating was completely realistic...but what can you expect? CGI animation was still very new at the time.
However, there's one problem: The movie was edited for length. Most of what was deemed nonessential was still another entire subplot--one involving the rival storm-chaser team (led by Cary Elwes, playing an antagonist who's not quite evil enough to be called a villain) and revealing their actual agenda.
But the editors didn't entirely succeed at what they attempted to do--that is, cut out the entire rival storm-chaser team apart from Elwes and Zach Grenier.
Which is why there are a few scenes that involve Abraham Benrubi (the only other actor from Elwes's team whose name I can recall right off the bat) looming imposingly behind Elwes, or some other fresh-faced thirtysomething smirking in the background. Their characters have names, and are listed fairly early in the end credits...but they seem to be little more than walk-ons.

touched down in a midwestern town my point is that Twister is
a film that should have been exactly what it was and no less
due to respect of reality to the real people who have been
through the real twisters that could tell you what an F-5
looks feels and sounds like. Everyday occurances like this
Hollwood could not resist and they had a huge summer hit.
  Jo at the beginning of the film just a little girl
her family is terrorized when her home is hit by an F-5
a tornado that can be in excess of 250 to 314 miles an
hour she tragically loses her father in the monster.
Now we come to present day in the film Bill Thornton who
is played by (Bill Paxton) and Dr. Melissa Reeves(Jami Gertz)
who are engaged are visiting a much older Jo(Helen Hunt)
to finalize there divorce. But little does Bill know that
he will coming on for a much further trip then just divorce
papers when he sees his old crew and the new satillite that
Jo has improved on that was his vision TOTO(Totable Tornado
Observatory)which he affectionately calls Dorthy.
  Having spats along the way with his fiance povides humor
but when the leechey Jonas Miller(Carey Elwes)thwarts there
misson and come up with the same idea as Bill a showdown is
looming as Bill tells Jo that weither Dorthy flies or not
he will leave in two days,this puts Twister into action ,
trying to beat Jonas to the punch and to get close enough to
the Tornadoes to release there cargo,they make a pit stop
at Aunt Megs (Loius Smith),where Twister get's a little bit
of an emotional storyline that Jo may still have feelings
for Bill Thornton,but after this scene Twister picks up and
pretty much gets right to the point,in one scene that is the
scariest of Twister at a drive in a Tornado looms as the
tension builds as the F-4 rips right through the drive in
and the town of Wetchitaw where Aunt Meg is the team hurrys
to save her life and when they do only to find that an F-5
is on the way,they must do anything and everything they can
to get there cargo in the monster of a twister so they can
save lives.
  Jan De Bont's tense and taught thriller is not without
it's humor Dusty(Phillip Seymour Hoffman)is the comic relief
in this film and provides laughs, the story between Bill Thornton
and Jo is romantic but is just not what the doctor orderd in a
film that has a title like Twister which is the real star with
incredible special effects from Industrial Light and Magic we
can now see what happens from outside and inside a twister but
the sustained F-5 at the films climax is incredible as it ,
destroys houses levels buildings , throws tractors and an oil
tanker and gives our charachters a run for there money.
  Twister has a worth while commentary from Jan De Bont
and is produced by Michel Chriton it has two documentarys
and is featured in DTS 5.1. that well if you don't know
what a tornado sounds like this is the closest your going
to get in fact the sound is so clear that it's the second
best iv'e heard next to Saving Private Ryan hey this may
not be an Award winning film but it's one that is worth
adding to your collection.",1037664000,,3276,4.315447154471545
2498245,3,B000E5KJDE,"I saw Twister in the theatre and then got the video when it came out. Director Jan DeBont had some awesome special effects in the movie. However, even great directing can't overcome a plot that is predictable and unfocused.
Basically, the plot centers around a group of professional ""storm-chasers"", scientists who track tornadoes and go where they strike. Meteorologist Bill Harding(Bill Paxton) has created TOTO(Totable Tornado Observatory), a device that sends sensors into the heart of a tornado to see how the storm behaves. Bill's former colleague--and now rival--Jonas Miller(Cary Elwes) has come up with a similar invention, and Bill accuses Jonas of stealing his technology. In fact, when Jonas demonstrates his machine, he and Bill nearly come to blows. There is also a romantic triangle here. Bill's estranged wife, Jo Thornton(Helen Hunt), like him a weather scientist, has divorce papers ready for him to sign, and Bill's girlfriend, Melissa(Jami Gertz), has come along to get a piece of the action. Bill at first wants to retire from storm-chasing and settle down with Melissa, but he is dragged back into the tornado scene when he discovers that Jonas wants to take credit for inventing something that he(Bill) in fact came up with.  Finally, as we see in the opening flashback scenes, Jo's father was killed by a tornado when Jo was a little girl, which is part of the reason for Jo's intense interest in the tracking of storms.
There is intense action throughout as Bill, Jo, and their fellow storm-chasers race across the Oklahoma countryside which is part of the Midwest's Tornado Alley. When I saw the movie in the theatre and later watched it on video, I was awed by the special effects--for instance, houses coming apart, cows spinning around, a pickup truck being lifted off the ground, fuel trucks blowing up, and the sky literally turning black in seconds. Also, TOTO, which Bill nicknames ""Dorothy"" in the film(from Dorothy and Toto, who were transported to Oz by a tornado in ""The Wizard Of Oz""), transmits some memorable color images, despite the mishaps Bill and Jo endure in getting their machine into the air. In the end, Melissa, who is terrified of storms and who realizes that Bill and Jo might still have feelings for each other, decides to leave. In the last destructive storm, Jonas, Bill's chief antagonist, dies when he gets reckless. He fails to secure his machine properly and as a result is sucked into the funnel cloud. Bill saves Jo's life by holding onto her as she clutches a pole, and they get back together.
Despite its awesome storm scenes, though, Twister is no better than average. Although I like its special effects, I think the plot lacks focus. If the movie had concentrated more on the action, I wouldn't be too disappointed. However, in my opinion, writers Michael Crichton and Anne-Marie Martin, in trying to develop the personal lives of their main characters, twist the plot(pardon the pun) in so many directions that it is sometimes difficult to figure out, and the characters aren't really interesting. There are also some scenes that I believe are completely unnecessary to the movie--for instance, the one where Bill, Jo, and their colleagues take a break from storm-chasing to go to the home of Jo's aunt for a steak-and-eggs breakfast. However, I think Twister's special effects save it from total disaster--after all, it's a movie about a natural disaster. The special effects alone make Twister worth seeing.",1037059200,,3476,4.993103448275862

That right there is pretty entertaining, and is about all you should expect from this movie - but you'll notice I gave it 4 stars.
I'm a *huge* tornado buff; I'm fascinated with and utterly terrified of them, so the special effects were enough to keep me gripping the theatre armrests the first time I saw it, and the couch the next several times. The plot...well, it's a love story/good v. evil/scientific competition/buddy movie...sort of. Phillip Seymour Hoffman probably has the most interesting role in the film, and pulls it off exceptionally well, The rest of the characters are largely forgettable, with lines of dialogue that, by and large, range from the bland to the outright annoying. Still, there are some genuinely funny moments, and a line here or there that made me laugh out loud.
Helen Hunt and Bill Paxton are two storm chasers in the midst of a divorce. They have gone their separate scientific ways, after almost completing a special set of instruments that will gather large amounts of data from inside the tornado itself. The movie is the story of how they get the instrument to work, their relationship as it develops again throughout the course of their travails, their sidekicks, and the ""bad"" scientist (Cary Elwes) trying to beat them to the punch with the device. The supporting cast are all able actors, and do a fine job with what's given to them.
The thing that really, *REALLY* bugs me, though, is the horrible science! This is, after all, a movie *about* *tornadoes* - it seems that they could have easily done a bit more research and gotten the majority of the details right. Ah well, c'est la vie, c'est la guerre.
The effects, though, are fantastic! ILM has once again worked their particular brand of wizardry, and for most of the time, the twisters look absolutely genuine. Fabulous. The suspense and the effects pretty much make the lack of plot and horrible science forgiveable, and we're left at the end with the satisfaction that comes from having sat through a horrifying vicarious experience.
Good stuff, overall.
The DVD extras aren't exceptional, but there's a good bit about ""the making of,"" and some commentary tracks.",1034985600,,2323,4.8686868686868685

There's a catch, you'd have to be insane to drive up to the tornado to release the machine to be sucked up. The two join forces along with the rest of the team and Bill's new fiancee (played by Jami Gertz). Stuff gets ravaged, cows fly and cars blow up. Yes. You need to see the 500 pound cow run at the beginning of the movie to the bomb shelter. It's hilarious. See Jo's father fly away to evaporation! Jonas (Cary Elwes) is a corporate sponsored storm chaser and he gets what he deserves because he's a sonofa. Does anybody really like ""The Shining,"" tornados don't. Pure havoc in a movie.

Bill Paxton does a solid job but one can't help but realize the nose dive his career took after this film was done. Oh well. Twister might have you wanting to become a storm chaser when it's all said and done. I know I gave it some thought.",1029456000,,427,4.023529411764706
2498249,5,B000E5KJDE,"When ""Twister"" was released in 1996, it was panned by many film critics; but not everyone agrees.  ""Twister"" takes place in America's heartland where tornadoes are common and where residents live in fear of destruction any time a very dark cloud looms overhead.
The film depicts the desires of the scientist, Dr. JoAnne Thornton-Harding (Helen Hunt), to get a tornado to swallow up hundreds of sensors so that scientists can analyze their data and obtain a better understanding of tornado dynamics.  Her soon-to-be-divorced husband, William 'Bill' Harding (Bill Paxton), plans to marry a very urban psychologist, Dr. Melissa Reeves (Jami Gertz), as soon as JoAnne signs the divorce papers.  Bill brings the divorce papers out to JoAnne, but she's too busy with her sensors and the discovery of a nearby funnel cloud.  JoAnne and her crew hurry off to chase the funnel cloud with Bill & Melissa along for the ride.
Over the course of the film, Melissa disovers what Bill really likes to do and that he still has a lot of feelings for JoAnne.  She also realizes that she hates being in very close proximity to tornadoes.
The special effects and constant action in the film keep the audience at the edge of their seats!

What I can still recall are the Hollywood-ized, utterly fake encounters with the ""tornadoes"".  Absolutely everything about the storms themselves and the science of storm chasing was grossly inaccurate.  From the Kenmore ice cube tray hailstorm to the ""green sky"" nowhere near an active thunderstorm, to the individual plucking of fence posts (how does wind impinge such an upward force on a paralell-aligned object fixed to the ground?) to the moment-by-moment predictions that the tornado is going to turn left or right, to the chasers riding alongside a tornado in an effort to have intercourse with it, etc., etc., etc., etc., etc. Nothing was even close to reality.
Tornadoes are a fascinating subject.  There are plenty of videos featuring REAL storm chases.  Start (and end) your search with those types of videos.",1026086400,,942,5.090909090909091
2498253,3,B000E5KJDE,"Twister has a worthy premise, some thrilling action sequences, and a great deal of potential, yet disappointingly is a film that adds up to less than the sum of its parts. Tornadoes cut swathes of devastation through mid-USA every year and television audiences the world over are shocked and yet strangely titillated by the resulting newsreel footage. So as a film following a group of (fictional) storm chasers as they attempt to scientifically measure a tornado from the inside (with a view to improving the warning systems), Twister has all the ingredients of an extraordinary viewing experience. It is certainly fast-paced and exciting, but also regrettably formulaic.
Cliches abound - cute dogs saved from imminent peril; chaser crews composed of stereotypical weirdo science nerds; a daring rescue from a destroyed house seconds before it collapses; some unexorcised trauma about a father's death-by-tornado; Bill Paxton and Helen Hunt cheating death innumerable times, even as the bad guys (rival tornado chasers) succumb. . . . . . . . . .
The special effects are what save this film from mediocrity. The tornadoes are frighteningly real and the debris showers (including a cow and a petrol tanker) will have audiences ducking for cover. And unlike many disaster films that seem to drag as they build to a climax, the tornadoes in Twister appear right from the word go. Bizarrely the soundtrack to the tornadoes was made by dubbing a camel's groan and slowing it down - resulting in some rather odd sounding twisters. By the time the camel is finally silenced and the story reaches its predictable conclusion, the cliches and improbabilities threaten to overwhelm, and the film ultimately fails to completely satisfy.",1024531200,,1725,5.142348754448399

2498255,3,B000E5KJDE,"""Twister"" is a movie that serves the appetizers but not the main course.  Throughout the movie, we're treated to some really cool special effects that capture the horror of a tornado.  Winds blow, cars get turned upside down, and even cows get tossed about.  Hands down, the twister itself should have gotten an award for Best Actor in a Leading Role.  The rest of the movie, however, is completely negligible.  Helen Hunt and Bill Paxton do little more than run around, looking scared and uttering lines of dialogue that never graduatre from the obvious.  And the plot?  It's basically an afterthought.  Twister makes a decent if unspectacular DVD, though.  Not only does the 5.1 mix rock the house, but thanks to the chapter selections, you can skip those boring parts that have tons of dialogue and go straight to the action scenes.  ""Twister"" isn't a bad movie, but a very bland one minus the special effects.  Recomended for die-hard action fans only; casual movie watchers should proceed with caution.",1021507200,,1007,4.899408284023669
2498256,4,B000E5KJDE,"Even if the melodramatics and the dialogue are contrived, TWISTER is still one of the best of the latter-day disaster films.  Much more realistic than a volcano turning L.A. into lava (VOLCANO) or a gung-ho uprising against evil aliens (INDEPENDECE DAY), the subject at the center of this 1996 sci-fi/disaster movie is one of the deadliest manifestations of nature--the tornado.
Helen Hunt and Bill Paxton portray scientists who, though they are on the edge of divorcing, are soonthrown back together when extremely violent storms form on the eastern fringe of the Rockies and soon sweep into the Midwest, an area known as ""Tornado Alley.""  Paxton looks upon it as a science, but Hunt is much more obsessive about it; she has been ever since a twister in June 1969 killed her father.  Caught up in this whole tornado business is Paxton's intended next wife (Jami Gertz).
Competing with a former partner (Cary Elwes) of theirs whom Paxton refers to as a ""night crawler"", Hunt and Paxton continually try to get their new tornado mapping device they call ""Dorothy"" (inspired by THE WIZARD OF OZ) into the heart of one of these dark and deadly storms.  They finally manage to do it with a monster twister measuring a mile wide at the base, but they nearly become casualties of that monster.
Despite the contrivances, TWISTER works because of the fine performances of Hunt and Paxton, who work good together even when they're bickering.  The film itself has a very kinetic, suspenseful, and downright frightening quality to it, thanks in large part to the direction of Jan DeBont (SPEED) and the realistic premise of the screenplay by Michael Crichton (JURASSIC PARK; WESTWORLD) and his wife Anne-Marie Martin.  The tornado effects, including the flying cow, the runaway debris, and the fuel tanker, are all quite hair-raising.
This is about as realistic a disaster film as there has been since the grand-daddy of all disaster films, Irwin Allen's 1974 epic THE TOWERING INFERNO.  It may not be an unflawed film, but it's definitely better than average.",1020988800,,2048,4.970760233918129

The chemistry between Helen Hunt and Bill Paxton really pulled me in to the feelings.  The fight in the truck when they get together again is classic.  The characters that they are portraying remind me of many average Jane and Joe's across the country.  The wide variety of personalities that add to the supporting cast are excellent.  Each one, in their own, adding to the overall mood of the movie.
This movie is entertaining (as movies should be) and the flaws are very easily overlooked.  It will be an enjoyable way to pass a few hours some night with the one you love.",1019260800,,810,4.583333333333333

The story starts really well, with a flash-back sequence that shows just why Helen Hunt's charactor is so obsessed with finding what makes twisters tick. However, the story kinda bogs and drags after that, although whenever a tornado appears, the film just kicks it into a higher gear.
The actors involved try really hard to make something out of the weak dialogue they're working with, but the main reason to watch this for the twisters. They have a malevolence all their own, and seem to have minds of their own, as they chasedown the main good guys.
Again, not much story substance, but with effects like this, who needs it?",1017187200,,871,4.554140127388535
2498259,4,B000E5KJDE,"Twister was written to bring light on the subject of storm chasing.  Now, everyone who actually does this knows that not even the most expert storm chaser can run into 150 tornadoes in one day!  Let alone are there any stupid enough to set the cruise control on their brand new, self-repairable Dodge Ram pickup (unless you're a Ford fan, that is) and let one of these monstrous storms eat it up.
Helen Hunt made for an awesome ""Jo.""  I think that she was incredible in this movie, going after what all meteorologists do, finding out what makes tornadoes tick.  While getting ready for one of those chases that will take them half way through Kansas.  Bill Paxton (as ""Bill"") shows up before Hunt's chase day begins with his new fiance, Melissa.  Hunt is still in love and not letting go, having been married to Paxton, she still wears his ring.  Covering it with her class ring, she signs divorce papers that Paxton has asked her to sign; deliberately ""forgetting"" one page.  Storms are a'brewin, and the chase team takes off.  Melissa asks Paxton if Hunt signed the divorce papers, realizing that she didn't, Paxton and his fiance take off chasing after the team to get Hunt's signature.  The rest it nothing but chasing twisters, etc.
I do believe that if this hadn't made out to be a love story (like Titanic and Pearl Harbor), it would've actually been fun.  Of course, there are obvious traits this movie follows (flying ""stuff"" everywhere, incl. cows, combines, semi's, etc.), and you can tell when stunt doubles come in.  Yes, there was even a stunt double for the Dodge Ram (or it's got some sort of cloning device allowing it to repair its own windshield in a span of nanoseconds).

Also with the water spouts, notice when they are watching the cow blow by them, that in the background they are really on a highway and another car passes them. And the ending?

Perhaps that's why they put ridiculous angelic voices as Bill and Helen are pulled into the vortex of the killer twister... instead of making it terrifying. In reality, that would be terrifying. This film, unfortunately, was not. The effects get five stars, the film gets a two, for missing so many opportunities.

2498282,3,B000E5KJDE,"""Twister"" is a success in many different ways, mainly due to the incredible use of special effects that went into its making. A movie about lots of big storms and at least five different tornadoes calls for some of the most sophisticated digital effects on the market, and on that basis, the movie delivers. The action is quite intense, and certain scenes call on some old-school clichs that we'll all recall from past disaster films. In fact, the only place in which the movie fails is its story, despite a very talented cast.
I would say that it started a revolution in the movies of today: nowadays, moviemakers seem to think that the bigger the effects, the better the movie, regardless of characterization or story. This is definitely the case with such movies as ""Volcano"" and ""Armageddon,"" and there are movies that seem to get the formula for effects and story evened out, but rarely. In this case, ""Twister"" is more about the special effects show than about anything else.
Beginning appropriately enough with (duh!) a tornado, young Joe (played in adulthood by Helen Hunt) is traumatized by the death of her father, who was sucked up in the twister while trying to hold the storm cellar door in place as the tornado comes wailing overhead. This is one of the movie's unexplained events: he is holding the door in place so that his wife and daughter would not be sucked out of the cellar, so when he disappears, why are they still standing there? Also unexplained is the absence of her mother for the rest of the movie: did she die? Was she abducted by aliens? Guess we'll never know.
Moving on in years, the present day finds Joe and a crew of storm chasers doing what they love: spotting twisters. It is here that the baggage piles on heavily: her ex-husband, Bill (played by Bill Paxton), wants her to sign divorce papers so he can marry his new girlfriend, who, annoying enough, tags along for most of the movie's ride. Because he wants her to sign the papers, he follows along with her to chase the storms, hoping that the system he devised will be a success.
That system is a way of plotting how tornadoes form in hopes that warning time may be increased for areas in harm's way. Of course, these machines must be placed in the storm's path just a few seconds before it reaches that specific spot, making for some incredibly tense situations. And, as if the tornadoes were not a formidable enemy, the movie introduces a rival group of storm chasers with sophisticated equipment and the same system Bill developed.
Before I get to the bad parts, I must say that the special effects and action in ""Twister"" are in all the right places. Director Jan de Bont gets everything right in these areas: our characters find themselves in one tight situation after another. Some are unbelievable, yes (I was a bit unconvinced when the twisters come right up on the hood of the red truck), but in the grand scheme of things, this isn't the kind of movie to take too seriously when it comes to the danger.
And the effects will blow you away. This is probably one of the best recreations of inclimate weather ever put forth for the big screen. The twisters themselves are fascinating: for those of us who have always been intrigued by them, this is probably the next best thing to actually seeing one up close (and, I'm sure, a lot safer). Waiting for the first real view of a tornado is one of the best things about this movie, too.
But the story is a flop, its only purpose being to supply the motive for the effects and action, while never actually taking on any cling or meaning. Actors Paxton and Hunt, as well as some brilliant supporting actors, are given characters that do little other than put themselves in danger again and again. Basically, the story is there to give the effects a purpose for being the movie, and then it really has nothing else to do and nowhere to go.
Overall, it's lacking. This is the kind of movie where the story is overrun by an overabundance of special effects, and while they are terrific, they cannot save the movie completely. I expected more out of the story, and while I was completely enamored with the special effects and technological excellence that was so lovingly extracted for the film, I would've like to have seen better characters for such talented actors.",991699200,,4308,4.610677083333333
2498283,1,B000E5KJDE,"I love Tornados.  I love reading about them and I love watching tornado videos.  And that's why this film was such a collosal disappointment to me.  Yes, the special effects are teriffic, but the screenplay is SO corny and contrived that I found myself wishing that all of the human characters would be anihilated.  Problem number one is Jamie Gertz's character, the girfriend of Bill Paxton's hero character.  She serves absolutely no purpose and every moment she is on screen is like fingernails on the blackboard.  Then there's the alleged romance between Helen Hunt and Paxton that is completely contrived and predicatble.  Let's also throw in an incredibly stupid subplot involving so ""bad guy"" rival scientists (""bad"" only because they have the audacity to take better paying jobs and to have theories that differ from the heroes).  The film also makes the fundamental scientific mistake of referring to the climax tornado as an ""F5"" when that scientific description refers to the damage a tornado causes, not its appearance.  Believe me, I could keep going.
Bottom line is that the screenplay for this film was written at about the level of a ten-year-old.  It has as many surprises and about as much drama as a Saturday morning cartoon.  Any weather-phile with a brain will likely be sorely disappointed.",990748800,,1312,5.0

2498288,5,B000E5KJDE,"It seems almost fashionable to say that you hated this movie. The reports I read of it said that you didn't feel any sympathy for the characters because they're storm-chasers, and thus they get themselves into the situations themselves - why the hell should we empathise with them? So, the first time I saw this film, true to type I hated it. Then, six months later, having completely forgotten what the film was about, I watched it late one night and loved it. And then watched it again in the early hours of the morning. And then watched it again the following day. Somehow, first time around, I had missed the beauty of the characterisations, and paid attention to the story and special effects, but believe me - the characters are the stars of this movie.
Bill Paxton and Helen Hunt are perfect playing opposite each other. From the moment the film begins you feel the sexual tension between them, and it is clear that these two people love each other but cannot live with one another. Whichever of the two writers (one of whom was esteemed Michael Crichton) dreamed up the idea of Paxton's new (and thankfully 3-dimensional) flame hit on a winning streak, because it introduces an interesting dynamic into what could have been just another droll special-effects movie. Two worlds collide, and you have that very primeval feeling of a man trapped between what he deems his duty and his true feelings - he wants to chase storms, but rationality says he has to settle down. Every moment Hunt and Paxton are alone together being weighted against the fact that Paxton's new partner is watching/listening/demanding attention lends the proceedings a tragic air that elevates `Twister' (forgive the pun) far above Jan De Bont's other films. That they know each other inside out yet are not together really pulls at the heartstrings. Anyone who disagrees with me should watch it again just for the scene in the rain on the hill when the second DOROTHY machine falls off the back of the truck. I'm not saying it's going to change your mind and make you love this movie, but the depth of feeling that goes into Hunt's character and the way that should-be husband Paxton deals with it is a truly phenomenal film moment. Far from having no empathy with the characters, I felt deeply for Hunt's obsessional quest to get over her father's death, and I related strongly to Paxton's character's attempts to put his destructive past behind him and move on to pastures new, despite loving that destructive past with all his heart. And, beyond Cary Elwes, there are none of the stereotypes associated with these sorts of movies; the supporting cast of talented character actors put `Twister' into a realm of its own.
So based on that, I think `Twister' deserves a second look. I'm not saying you're going to love it, but where this film succeeds where others (like `Species' and `Sphere' and `Speed') don't is in creating a believable sense of camaraderie in the characters, rather than allowing every character to fit into an easily labelled `star' or `support' bracket. Now I know there are many who will disagree, but I think this is certainly De Bont at his smoothest, Crichton at his most sensitive (not sentimental - completely different things), Hunt at her most expressive and Paxton at his most exuberant. And it's even got a Lisa Loeb song on the soundtrack - what more could you want?",984009600,,3380,4.76962457337884
2498289,5,B000E5KJDE,"There's something that always gets on my nerves: When people rate and review DVDs, they only talk about the DVD itself and not the actual film. I mean, if they think there's nothing extra on the DVD, then they'll give the movie a bad rating. But what about the actual film itself? Have those people even really paid attention to the film or just complained about the DVD? That's why I suggest to people that they watch the films first on video or in the movie theater BEFORE seeing it on DVD so they will actually rate and review the film instead of just the DVD.
Anyway, TWISTER is an excellent film. Helen Hunt and Bill Paxton make the perfect leading pair; they have a fantastic, supurb supporting cast as well. The special effects for the film are just amazing and the special effects are what makes the film so interesting. The plot is OK, but it's also kind of predictable. Even before watching this film you can tell that Jo (Helen Hunt) and Bill (Bill Paxton) will not only get their creation, Dorathy, working, but will also get back together again. The film is also kind of long, but I guess there was a lot happening and the producers and director thought that a long movie would be perfect for the film.

2498291,2,B000E5KJDE,"""Twister"" is a movie that stars a lot of tornadoes.  Unfortunately, people get in their way.  The special effects are top-notch, but the story is so full of little Hollywood tricks, it's hard to take.
 Why can't Helen Hunt be interested in tornadoes just because, well, tornadoes are interesting?  That's not good enough for this flick, so the screenwriters throw in a flashback to the terrifying twister that killed her dad.  It's as if they don't think the audience would believe and intelligent, attractive young woman would fritter away her life pursuing such an esoteric field of interest otherwise.  Just a touch of Freudian silliness and typical screenplay shorthand that substitutes for real characterization.  I was hoping that very same tornado would come back at the end so she could get revenge, but no such luck.
 Also, you can tell Bill Paxton's the good guy because he has some sort of mystical connection with the twisters- plus, his crew are a bunch of rock-n-roll tornado cowboys.  They make supercells fun!
 And Cary Elwes is the bad guy because not only can he not sense tornadoes, but he's in it for money.  It helps, too, that he drives around in all-black high tech vehicles.  Thanks for telegraphing that, people.  But then again, it's pretty easy to predict everything that's going to happen in the movie.
 On the positive side, you get to see plenty of tornado mayhem and that's worth at least one star.  Unfortunately, the rest of the movie only adds up to another.",982022400,,1492,4.818897637795276

And just as the real star of ""Cat Ballou"" was Lee Marvin's drunken horse, so the character who steals ""Twister"" is a cow caught up in the turbulent winds turning mad somersaults in midair, looking thoroughly bemused.

2498308,4,B000E5KJDE,"Like Armageddon, Godzilla, and Independence Day this is one of those summertime films with an embarrassingly bad screenplay but great special effects.  Some of the things that are just plain stupid about this file are: The actors are shown within a few feet of a tornado  yet there hair is barely moving around and their truck sits motionless.  The wind is able to blow a house across the road or lift up a semi-truck yet they seem unaffected. The whole premise of the film is that, currently, people only get a 10-minute warning before a tornado is going to strike an area - but the main characters seem to know where the tornadoes are going to be hours ahead of time.  Then there is the evil meteorologist (in his fleet of black vans) that  "" is only it for the money.""  (I didn't know that there were bad meteorologists and good ones.)  Lighted neon signs fly through the air (where are they getting power from??) I could go on and on and on, but you get the idea.

Let's just forget for a moment that the acting in the film is slightly better than mediocre. And let's also forget that little speech at the beginning about tornados and warning systems...
Helen Hunt and Bill Paxton turn out nearly believable performances in this film about tornado hunters in Oklahoma.
The plot: Girl finds tornado. Girl loses tornado. Girl finds boy. Girl loses boy. Girl gets tornado and boy.
At its core, this film is another eye/ear candy flick just like The Matrix. The visual effects are outstanding. Widescreen allows you to see more of the film... and more of the supporting cast! The sound on this DVD makes you think that you are there! If you have a home theater system with surround sound, this DVD MUST be part of your collection.

One of the things that gets me about movie reviews is that  every thing has to be so subjective. In the case of this little movie, the  subjective complaint is PLOT, PLOT, PLOT. A couple of things. First, when a  latter-day movie has the name of Twister, what do you expect? A Long Day's  Journey Into Night? Schindler's List? I think not. This movie is for  escapism and it should be judged in that context.
Secondly, the movie  does have a plot. Hell, there's even sub-plot.
Bill Paxton is Bill  Harding, a TV weatherman chasing his soon-to-be ex-wife Jo (Helen Hunt).  You see, Bill wants to get married to psychiatrist Melissa (Jami Gertz) but  he can't until he get Jo to sign the divorce papers. Jo, however, is  occupied. See, she is chasing something herself. Tornadoes. She hates them.  She's obsessed by them. So, she hunts them down so she can place small  sensors into them. The sensors will give her and other scientists better  information about them. While she's chasing the tornadoes, she's running  away from Bill. She's playing hard to get, or rather, hard to get rid of.  Jo is ambivalent about divorcing Bill. She's so ambivalent that she's built  his invention, named Dorothy, to launch the sensors into a funnel, if she  catches one. Maybe, in the meantime, she'll catch her man. Again.
So, off  they go. Jo's chasing tornadoes with her rag-tag bunch of storm chasers.  Bill is chasing her trying to get her to sign the divorce papers, while  trying to convince the aforementioned rag-tag bunch that he's not back in  the storm-chasing game. All the while, Melissa is trying to figure out all  the things swirling all about her.
Meanwhile, while Jo's group is  rag-tag, the group headed up by Dr. Jonas Miller (Cary Elwes) is not. It's  slick and para-military. Dr. Miller seems to have ripped off Bill's designs  and constructed a sensor launcher of his own to rival Dorothy. So, it's a  race to see which storm-chasing team gets their device launched first.
I  went into the movie house wanting a thrill ride and I got exactly what I  wanted. It was an enjoyable experience. I can actually see Twister: The  Ride on the Universal Studios tour in the forseeable future. That's because  the movie is just that, a non-stop thrill ride from start to finish with  just enough of a plot to let you catch your breath and move the story  along.
See for yourself.

This movie also showed me the power and devastation of tornadoes and how terrifying they are, for those caught in their path.  The characters in this movie were likable, but I did not find the plot very interesting.  However, I did enjoy this movie for the special effects.",967593600,,430,4.68
2498312,5,B000E5KJDE,"Reading some of the reviews about this movie, I've noted that a lot of  people believe that the only good part of the movie was the special  effects, and many believed that the plot was lacking.  I believe that the  special effects were great, but they were only an extra goody, and not the  best part of the package.
In the beginning of Twister, you are taken back  several years to the late sixties in the eastern part of the United States.  A father rushes through his country home, and his wife follows his lead  with their daughter, Joe, with them.  They hide in a backyard storm cellar,  but as the storm begins to pick up, they discover that the family dog is  not inside.  The father quickly ushers the dog inside, and shortly after he  recloses the door, the twister comes.  The father gets sucked into the  tornado, holding the door, while the mother and daughter are still safe  inside the cellar.
After this, the movie goes to the present, and a new  plot begins.  Joe's husband catches up with the storm chasers-also, his  former work companions-to have his wife sign the divorce papers so he could  get married to his new fiance, who he brings along.  But when trying to get  Joe to sign the papers, a tornado is found nearby, and the storm chasers  follow it to send up their newest project-Dorothy.  Dorothy is a machine  that both Joe and her husband designed, and when it comes in contact with a  twister, it will send up many sensors, enabling the storm chasers to get  readings on the tornado.  Their theory is if they can get readings on  tornados, and learn about them, they will be able to create better tornado  warnings, allowing people to get to safety more quickly before a tornado  hits.
Personally, I really liked this movie.  When I rented it awhile  back, I would just watch it over and over.  The plot is rather likeable,  and the characters are interesting and unique.

2498321,5,B000E5KJDE,"Helen Hunt and Bill Paxton do a great job in the lead roles of TWISTER.  The story contains many interesting and engaging subplots: the imminent  divorce of Hunt and Paxton's characters; their shared attraction to  studying the nature of tornado formation, and to finding better ways to  spot tornadic activity in order to save lives; their competition with a  self-serving, but not as brilliant antagonist; interactions between Hunt  and her aunt; and Paxton's somewhat 6th sense that helps him predict what  storms may do.
When you watch the movie you may scoff at the  personalities of Hunt's supporting field crew. While not everyone in  graduate school acts the way they do, there are certainly real-life  characters in graduate schools across the country who could be confused  with Hunt's crew.  They are an enthusiastic, talented bunch.  Having spent  9 years as a science graduate student myself I have no problem envisioning  such a group.  You will certainly have a favorite supporting cast  member.
The special effects are awesome.  The storyline is plausible --  there are real-life storm chasers out there.  The factor that really makes  this film work for me is that for parts of the USA (like mine), tornados  are a very real threat -- e.g., I actually saw my first funnel cloud form  last week, and it touched down no more than 1.5 miles from my house!  The  sirens didn't go off, and if I hadn't happened to be outside I would not  have known to take shelter.
For people in other parts of the world  where tornados are not common -- they can be deadly, and are, for some  people, an annual summertime threat!
5 stars for interesting characters,  story, and great special effects that support rather than overwhelm the  show.
I highly recommend this show -- good fun, good action, and even a  touch of romance.

2498327,2,B000E5KJDE,"This movie a couple of years ago was the first one that set the path for BIG NATURE CATASTROPHY movies with DARN EXPENSIVE special effects and MINIMAL common sense and TEPID actor performances. The visual effects send  shivers down your spine, but unfortunately they make up only max. 30  minutes of the movie, so meanwhile you can take a nap, because sluggish  romance between main characters is not persuasive, but there is nothing  else in the movie, besides counting scenes that in real life would have  killed our heroes: Well, if you don't know that NOTHING can survive after  being crushed into the core of a tornado (yes, even if Ms. Hunt clutches  the buttress of a bridge VERY TIGHTLY), you should watch CNN or DISCOVERY  channel more often. From the point of view of true-to-life movie,  ""Volcanoe"" was much better..",960940800,,827,4.808510638297872

The DTS sound is  better then the DOLBY DIGITAL,the storm the wind in this movie was great,is very loud is like your there of the middle of the  action.

2498329,3,B000E5KJDE,"This movie was a blast.  It was fun to watch and it was very entertaining.  If you can, check it out on DVD, the digital sound mix is definately something you can use to show off your sound system.  The only problem I  had with this movie was the fact that the plot seemed to keep repeating:  Go out and get tornado, almost get killed, survive.  That is mostly the  movie, and there is a side love story.  Here is an interesting gripe, when  they are 20 feet away running from the tornado, their hair isn't even  blowing!  I guess CG tornados can't do that.
Still, great special  effects, good fun, and good entertainment.  Reccomended for action buffs.",960336000,,653,4.432203389830509

But when mother nature takes her course, and  things start to get out of hand, Paxton and Hunt's characters join forces  to escape Earth's deadliest natural force.  Directed by Jan De Bont.

2498334,3,B000E5KJDE,"The special effects were awsome---the plot not so great. Okay movie, but deffinatly just a renter. Helen Hunt is extremely good in this movie however and if you're a fan it is a must-see.

2498335,5,B000E5KJDE,"First of all, anyone who tells you they hated this movie simply did not give it a chance. People who can bring up all the little inconsistancies of the movie obviously spent more time looking for them than actually watching  the movie. Being a meteorology student studying severe weather, I can  safely say that some of the ""impossibilities"" in the movie can  actually have have actually happened before. Tornadoes are a scientific  anomoly that we don't know everything about. The plot is rather unique,  considering no other movie has ever featured tornadoes as the main  attraction. A group of rag-tag storm chasers roams across the plains  Oklahoma is search of tornadoes in an effort to study them, hoping to  develop an advanced warning system (which is desperatly needed in many  parts of the country). Their plan is to deploy a large steel drum filled  with sensors into an approaching tornado. This is where fantasy and reality  take two totally seperate paths. Real-life storm chasers would never try to  get as close as the chasers in the movie did. But after all, this is an  action movie, and if it had stuck to formalities, the movie would have been  very boring. The sub-plot was considerably weak, though. Jo (Helen Hunt)  and Bill (Paxton), are finalizing a divorce which Jo is trying desperatly,  but subtly, to get out of. Before starting the days chase, Bill comes by  with a new fiance to get the divorce papers. Jo is planning on trying to  get him back for the group, if not only for herself. After discovering that  Jo and her team have finished a project that he had started (the sensor  package), he is convinced to stay for the day and help them chase. Events  transpire and it becomes evident that Bill is ""back."" The  dialogue, which was blasted by all sorts of critics, is quite suited for  the film in my opinion. Many complained that it was too basic, dull, plain,  lacking depth, whatever other adverb you can think of. But if you stop to  think about it, would you have an in-depth conversation about  tornadogenesis with your team while a tornado is bearing down upon you? I  don't think so. Besides, 3/4 of the people who saw it, saw it because of  the special effects. They are spectacular, but the only complaint I had was  that they made the tornadoes appear out of pathetic looking status clouds,  rather than the jaw dropping rotating wall clouds and supercell  thunderstorms that most tornadoes come from. This is a great movie, because  it has such homely appeal. I couldn't imagine this movie with Tom Cruise or  Jennifer Aniston. It reflected the laid back attitude of the mid-west,  which added to the film's effect. Definetly worth seeing.",956620800,,2686,4.742424242424242
2498346,5,B000E5KJDE,"If you're not watching this movie on LaserDisc or DVD you're missing out. This movie is one of the best surround sound demos one can have for a home theater.

Being a ham radio operator & sometime storm chaser, this movie makes chase teams look like a bunch of clowns yelling into their CB radios.  The groups I have been associated with are a lot more professional.  Not  particularly accurate as far as tornado behavior is concerned.  How many  people can run in a field & escape an F5 twister (ha)?  But the special  effects are really good & the soundtrack is awesome.  Still worth the  buy for the laughs.",948585600,,532,4.346938775510204

This disc includes both widescreen and full screen versions of the  movie. Unfortunately, there aren't any good special features on this disc  (thats why only 4 stars instead of 5). I would have liked to have seen some  behind the scenes info. This film has stunning visual effects and it would  be nice to watch the computer art gurus in action!

2498356,1,B000E5KJDE,"Just goes to show how utterly vapid a movie can be. Bunch of tornado chasing mental midgets led by the otherwise marvelous Helen Hunt traipse about the countryside (in chase scenes that smacked of a b-version of  ""Smokey and the Bandit II"") trying to get themselves killed as  often as possible. Sadly, they fail. Scene where Hunt's character's father  gets sucked up by a tornado is eerily... no, EXACTLY like the opening scene  in The Wizard of Oz. If you're the kind of yahoo that says things like,  ""The special effects were EXCELLENT!"" buy this video.",937872000,,556,4.75
2498357,2,B000E5KJDE,"Right hand red, left foot green, Twister, yeah, Twister, from MB.  TWISTER was about as silly and corny as my joke.  Great effects, but by time they had the tractor-trailer caught up in the tornado, they may as well have  thrown in Yankee Stadium.  The dopey romance (Duh, will they get back  together?  Duh, I dunno.) interrupts the tension that may have been able to  build.  See TWISTER on cable, where it's worth the price.",936748800,,427,4.6
2498358,4,B000E5KJDE,"What I loved about this hit is the effects. I myself attend college in Alabama and was caught in a tornado a few weeks ago. I have the scars on my head to show it, but after seeing this I knew what to expect to happen but  I didn't think the thing would drop its ugly end just a few hundred feet  from campus and slam me into a brick wall. However, this film is one of my  favorites and my family loves it. I love the music and the soundtrack. But  the story could use some work. I have yet to see a disaster film with a  firm and solid story to equal the power of the special effects.  ""TITANIC"" is the best one so far but even the script in that  could use some polishing...",924220800,,676,3.8905109489051095

The visual effects are superbly done (probably Speilberg's  doing) but the audio recording onto DVD is lousy.  The rear channels are  muffled and not much information is sent to them.  The center channel is  also a dissapointment.  We all buy DVD's to get superb audio and sound but  the dialog is completely lost is many scenes and you have to strain to hear  what is being said.  The Left and Right channels drown the center, even if  you move the center channel volume up.

2498362,2,B000E5KJDE,"Sorry folks, you may love the movie and you may, like me, even want to watch it over and over but it is NOT a great movie.  The direction is marginal, the plot is poor and in Pan and Scan the movie is worth maybe one  full watching and toss it but.... in DVD with Home Theater and Wide Screen  the movie's only claim to fame, tornado power, shines.  It is not that they  tried to increase anyones knowledge of tornadoes, if experts were used much  they must have been ignored alot, but the shear power displayed is exciting  and thrilling to watch.  This is one of the movies you buy to show off the  system, not to watch from end to end.

However, if you're looking for a fun, adventurous movie with great special effects and a decent storyline that will atleast keep you watching to the end, then Twister is one of the best.  Hunt and Paxton not only convey the emotional danger behind the oncoming of the twisters but also, as stormchasers, display a giddy, child-like wonder for tornadoes.  If you're watching on DVD, expect thunderous movie-theater sound that makes the fantastic twisters roar to life, which should add plenty of replay value to your movie.  Also, selecting a particular scene to jump to will come particularly useful here, unlike some other DVD titles.  If your the only one on the block to own a DVD player, this is a great title to show off.  END",897868800,,841,4.805555555555555
