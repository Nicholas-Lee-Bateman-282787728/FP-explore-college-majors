7304853,5,B0102AL0RY,"While not advertised as such, the $49.99 release includes dual format (Bluray + DVD) and features some of the manga artwork on the case liners.

Definitely worth checking out the manga as well if you enjoy the show (or are frustrated with it too for that matter).",1442880000,24,263,4.595744680851064

7304868,1,B0102AL0RY,"When I purchased this as a gift for my boyfriend we discovered it could only be played on a region B device. This meaning we couldn't play it with any American device (Blu-ray player, PlayStation 4 or 3, etc.). Upon further research a Region free Blu-ray player is $100! ALSO just in case you were wondering where the Region B area is: Africa, Southwest Asia, Europe (except Russia and Kazakhstan), Oceania (including Australia and New Zealand) and their dependencies. NOT THE U.S.!! I was extremely shocked to read that it isn't mandatory for the seller to disclose what region it's intended for! Then when returned only was given HALF of my refund. Extremely unsatisfied and time consuming! DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!",1483488000,5,716,4.925619834710743

7304870,5,B0102AL0RY,"- Synopsis: An anime portraying the ordinary life of a young man. Until tragedy hits him and turns him into a ghoul. A creature that resembles a human, but with hunger that drives them to consume humans. He's a very unique ghoul in which his mind is human, but his body is that of a ghoul. As such, it is a very painful and conflicting experience for him, as he struggles to blend in with society. He's not alone, however, and thanks to the help of his newfound allies, is able to somewhat go back to a peaceful lifestyle. But that all changes when new enemies instigates trouble; once again threatening our main character's way of life.

===========================================================================================================

- Analysis: The anime also has an interesting implication regarding ghouls. For what purpose do they exist? Perhaps to weed out the human population to prevent overpopulation or more of a survival of the fittest perspective? Maybe to punish humans for their sins, from a more religious standpoint. Or maybe they exist as evidence of humans that have evolved? Some of these concepts make for good thought-provoking material.

- Features: English and Japanese dub, as well as English subs. 12 episodes on 2 Blu-rays, and 12 episodes on 2 DVDs with a run-time of about 5 hours. Rated TV-MA for violence, blood and gore, and some fan-service.

- Conclusion: Overall, a reasonably violent anime with a likable cast. Fight scenes were fairly satisfying as ghouls and doves alike clash with each other. Interesting character development, a nice diversity of characters and personalities. Some theatrical scenes that can either be weird or quite humorous. And the thought of whether to feel sympathy for the humans or ghouls. Or if they can eventually coexist.

7304871,2,B0102AL0RY,I was upset because I can't play the disk because I'm not in region B and this isn't exactly the distributors fault but at the same time it should be more adviortised that it's for region B,1476489600,,189,4.135135135135135
7304872,3,B0102AL0RY,"I find this anime to be a little overrated, but there are still things I like about it even if it wasn't as emotionally engaging as I hoped it would be. I do love how there are no set ""bad guys"" in the series. As a viewer you are made to sympathize with both humans and ghouls, finding neither party definitively evil or good. While there are members of each race that certainly embody these extreme qualities, there are several other characters who stand somewhere more in a moral grey area, and I find that both interesting and refreshing.

MILD SPOILER I found the final episode when the protagonist Kaneki finally accepts himself and who he as become to be very satisfying, but the effort that it took to reach that point felt rather excessive and prolonged- i mean, it took all god%*#! season just for the show to feel like it was finally ""starting"".... But, perhaps it was the anticipation of that moment that made the final scene of season one as gratifying as it was. One could effectively argue that season one is about Kaneki's struggle to accept what has happened to him, but i don't think the writers explored that internal conflict to the full extent they could have, opting instead for episodes full of blood, action and violence. Which is fine, if that's what you're looking for in an anime. But from a character driven perspective, Kaneki's final resolve to accept this fate was really the only truly memorable moment of the first season, and i think that's why the whole thing felt a little flat to me.

Bottom Line: A violent, gritty, high intensity romp through a supernatural sub-culture of Tokyo. This anime's high reputation precedes itself, but is still worth a watch.",1471392000,,1691,4.671140939597316

7304889,5,B0102AL0RY,"I love this anime, I can fully understand and relate to ken, I know what it's like to be a outcast and to feel useless. I get why he turned as well, the story line, music and art are wonderful, I feel it is was every dime I paid.

  I also like the fact even though it does not state it is Dvd and blue ray it is, someone should put that in the heading of the product though because there is alot of confusion about that. If that was fixed reviewers like myself would not need to go over that many times.

Anyway I read the manga and I think it's good they mixed it up so the story line is not the same. This product as has extras like commentary and stuff like that,if you like horror this maybe for you.",1462665600,,705,3.909090909090909

7304906,5,B0102AL0RY,I was looking for this series for a while and finally found it here. My daughter watches the subbed version says the subbing is very good on this one.

7304910,4,B0102AL0RY,"I give it more like 31/2 stars. Not to bad. People were making such a big deal I thought I'd check it out. For me it started off well and ended awesome, like literally the last two episodes were great. Everything in the middle Eh it was OK. The protagonist is a bit of a cry baby and takes awhile to come into his new ""powers"" he's been stuck with. The animation looks great nice character design. They do wrap the initial story line by the last episode while at the same time leaving a ton of huge plot points wide open and unanswered. Perhaps season two will get dubbed and we'll see the progression of our characters.",1456185600,2,620,4.262711864406779

7304928,5,B0102AL0RY,"Amazing show. Some of the best character development i'ver ever seen in an anime. English dub is near perfect, Tindle as Kaneki is a lot better than i thought he would be so that was good, Palencia completely nails Touka (she's good in everything so it was no surprise just more convermation that she's one of the best ever), Tatum at Tsukiyama is absolutely brillant he does some of his best work ever, which is saying a lot. So overall the dub was excellent. The case the show comes in is superb very durable case mad of some kind of hard plactic i think and had both the DVD and BD is seperate cases with some awesome artwork on both cases.",1447372800,3,643,4.322314049586777

He was bleeding down his leg and clutching my package over his right bosom. He gave me it and said the horror is right behind him, he told me my package got delivered to his house by mistake. I take him inside and opened it, it was wonderful and all of it was in perfect condition with a wonderful box art and the Blu-ray/DVD worked perfectly, he fell over from loss of blood. I heard a knock at the door, I looked out the window to see a horror no man could describe. It was green, scaly, and wet. I was so scared of what it was it wanted. I squeaked open the door, I looked into its eyes and screamed ""WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM US!?"" It looked at me with all its evil and smoke poured out his nostrils. It glared at me and said, ""about tree fitty"".
