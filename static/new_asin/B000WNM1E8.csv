2987700,4,B000WNM1E8,"Major Plaster does a good job at introducing the world of the sniper to the public.  He pulls no punches, and gets right down to the nitty gritty of the job.  I find him entertaining, and forthright.  I especially enjoyed  the added interview with Gunny Hathcock.  This is a must see video  companion to his book.  I can't wait to buy his advanced video, and The  Ultimate Rifleman video to add to my collection.",940377600,18,412,4.472972972972973

8224355,4,B000WNM1E8,Good information but a little out of date and some is still very useful.  So many changes to equipment and tactics now.  He has some updated DVDs that should be better.  This covers basics and has good information.  For shooting long range there are some log range shooting DVD available from other ex seals and snipers worth looking at and more up to date..  do a search,1480982400,,371,4.477611940298507

8224359,5,B000WNM1E8,I bought it from non-amazon. Video was VHS so not so great quality. But it covers very good points. Video uses the rapid fire SR90 sniper rifel.,1229212800,,144,4.37037037037037
8224360,3,B000WNM1E8,"I enjoyed the video but found most of the knowledge discussed to be information readily available in most military manuals. As a former Marine and Army firearms trainer and technician I found it a good review but not really relaying any ""new knowledge."" With that said I do recommend it. But it is overpriced for what it is.
I purchased my copy from Paladin Press and was disappointed as it and all their other videos on this subject were recorded at super long play and the grainyness made it difficult to really see all that was presented. There really is no excuse to charge Standard Play rates for Super Long Play videos.",1038268800,,625,4.589285714285714
