7797422,5,1572251050,"I thought this was a wonderful video for kids. I have a 7 year old and a 2 year old who were fascinated by the sights, sounds, and information on the tape. Both of my kids learned to speak a few words in Gaelic and are now attempting to make the musical instrument that was demonstrated. I would love to view other tapes of this series and believe it would be a great addition to any library or school collection.",1080691200,,413,4.175
