7899028,5,6305975035,"I must declare a bias - I am a HUGE fan of Janel Moloney
(Curious that both the leads have similar sounding surnames ie Meloni & Moloney)
This has become my favourite movie
Nicely told & performed
This was released 1-2 years before Janel's breakthrough in the West Wing
She is a lovely actress & it is difficult to understand why she did not have more work in the '90s
I found the romance to be much more ""satisfying"" than that in the WW
Any of Janel's fans should buy this - they will not be disappointed
(SPOILER ALERT) It has a happy ending",1473724800,,543,4.230769230769231

7899030,5,6305975035,"I'm really a Meloni fan and loved seeing another side of the SVU star.  He's 35, his career is in the dumpster and he puts on this facade of the perennial joker to hide his pain and insecurity.  Hard to see him in this light when you see the testosterone overloaded detective on SVU - but there he is -  vulnerable, hopeful and confused.  It's so real it hurts to watch.  Watch it anyway - and be prepared to be a little uncomfortable especially as he tries to get his foot in the door of the comedy clubs.  Busfield and Moloney are great too, but it's all Christopher.  He can say more with his body language and facial expressions than most actors around today.  Highly recommended if you like real honest emotions.",1268352000,,717,4.378787878787879
7899031,2,6305975035,"Being a diehard Christopher Meloni fan, I enjoyed seeing something from his younger days as an actor (pre Oz and Law and Order:SVU). Meloni has a remarkably deft touch with comedy and it was interesting to see which of his signature touches he's retained in his later work and which (in particular an almost elfin boyish smile) he's dropped. As for the film itself, the first half is not bad, although it's difficult to understand exactly what Meloni's character sees in his leading lady other than her extravagant delight in offering him a particular sexual service that was at one time illegal in many states. But half way through, the whole thing just falls apart: scenes that appear to have nothing at all to do with the plot line (which pretty much disappears) or with each other are plunked down with no apparent narrative logic, characters make undeveloped and confusing personality changes, and -- a sure sign a film is in trouble -- there is an extended ""travelogue"" montage, in this case of a dismally rainy Washington, D.C., that does nothing to advance the story.  As a result, the final resolution, while expected, rings decidedly untrue.  If you're a Meloni fan, get this one at the video store or on NetFlix, don't buy it.  As for Mr. Meloni, he proves he can be good in anyting, but he deserves (and has since gotten)far better material.",1119657600,,1353,4.748936170212766
7899032,4,6305975035,"I bought this, interested in seeing some of actor Christopher Meloni's indie work.  He fit the character, Barry, quite well.
The story line is a romance between 2 adults whom you might not normally envision together.  They have their faults, and they make the romance work nonetheless.  Not being a big romance movie fan, I think I appreciated this story, as it was more realistic than sappy.  Not everything goes perfect, and the characters aren't perfect, but neither is life.",1058054400,2,478,4.9375
7899033,4,6305975035,"I bought this DVD after reading excellent reviews over at imdb.com, and because it was the only way to see it (because it's only available in this format).  THis was a wonderfully refreshing look at the realistic side of love and commitment.  Janel Moloney gives a wonderful performance that is erily similar to the role she plays on The West Wing, despite the fact that this was made before she got the job on West Wing.  Her performance on WW is what prompted me to get this, and it was well worth it.  Christopher Meloni and Timothy Busfield (also from TWW) are wonderful as the love interest and his best friend, both of whom have their share of trouble with women.  SO, see this movie, but be warned that it is rated R (as far as I could tell) because it goes a little farther with some aspects of relationships than other movies might.  It's an independant film so it could get away with more. The DVD contains a full directors Commentary which is very entertaining. To recap: this is a great movie! If you like offbeat romances with a great deal of humor then this is your kind of movie.",998092800,7,1094,4.417910447761194
