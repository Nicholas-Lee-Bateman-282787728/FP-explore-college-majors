898093,4,6304563752,"Comparable to the episode of THE HAUNTED MASK, WELCOME TO DEAD HOUSE is a very well done and masterful Goosebumps episode. When two kids and their parents move to Dark Falls, they didn't expect to find that their town was a ghost town, and that their house is not just any old haunted house - it's almost like a theme park for the haunting ghosts of the town. Much darker than most of the Goosebumps episodes and similar to George Romero's NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD (though of course, much more toned down), this zombie episode is surprisingly very scary and riveting the entire way through. Well scripted and eerily atmospheric.",1074124800,,628,4.666666666666667
898094,4,6304563752,"I was actually surprised how good this was. The absence of bloody effects and profanity allows the author to simply concentrate on making us nervous. The start is so well done. The story STARTS normal, but we are given some irony and subtle hints of what is to come. The town Dark Falls is portrayed quite well. The images are not miles beyond plausibility, and we can see that something is not right. The gentle but creepy piano music in this video adds to the spooky atmosphere. The writer continues to gradually make us nervous, and then he hits us with more scary news (or to be more accurate scary history). (Very good!) One aspect of good horror is that the hints start small, but then they start getting bigger and more obvious. (Good horror can be like putting a puzzle together. We might find ourselves playing with a few small pieces. They may not mean much to us at first; but then we may find ourselves getting bigger pieces that make the outcome easier to see.) Another  thing the writer did VERY WELL here is that he created a wonderfully drawn family. On one hand, they are NOT a sugary blameless family; nor are they a repulsive and vulgar family like Rosanne and The Simpsons. The writer showed that they can bicker amongst themselves, without getting dirty or insulting, but that they also know when to function as a family. WHATEVER HAPPENED TO THE ABILITY TO DRAW FAMILIES THIS WAY??? I do not want to spoil the ending for those of you who have not seen it. For you parents reading this, it may be a good idea to watch this with your children. It is not exactly a harmless video. I will conclude by saying that this was so well done, it actually got me to buy the series of videos. Once you get into this series, you may find out just how easy it is to get hooked.",997920000,,1784,4.389728096676738
898095,4,6304563752,"This has quickly become a family classic in our house, Particularly around Halloween. My 4 1/2, 8 1/2 and 10 years old girls love this one!
The story stems around a shady real estate salesman(aren't they all) whom offers a can't refuse deal to a unsuspecting family from 'out of town'.  Unknown to the family, Dark Falls was the victim of some type of hazardous chemical spill a while back, causing the existing residents to become 'living dead'.  Unfortunately for these 'living dead' corpses, they are dependent on 'the living' for nourishment.
Thus, they use this one piece of real estate property - AKA Dead House - as 'bait' to unsuspecting family's in order to feed. Without disclosing the whole storyline, I must say the thing with the dog at the end adds a nice touch. Well worth $10.  I've spent twice that continually renting it at the video store!",970099200,5,858,4.706666666666667

898212,5,6304563752,"I show Dead House each year to my middle school students. There is always dead silence in the room as they watch it (no pun intended). This movie has quite a few make- you -jump- moments and is genuinely scary without being too scary, especially for middle school. I highly recommend this one. Teachers could use this to teach suspense, foreshadowing, prediction, etc.",1369526400,,368,4.857142857142857
898213,5,6304563752,"I grew up reading the books, but I only saw a handful of episodes when they originally aired in the middle 1990s. I checked out several Goosebumps VHS at my local library several years ago, in which one of them was Welcome to Dead House. Yes, it has a low-budget and bad acting, but I still liked it for some odd reason. I later found the VHS at a local thrift store. I later found out that the episode was released on DVD back in 2004. Luckly, a few years ago, I found the DVD thrown into the five dollar bin at Walmart!

Welcome to Dead House is a great addiction to my Goosebumps Collection.",1346371200,2,594,4.165217391304348
898214,2,6304563752,"The book got me hooked  and back into reading. I was excited when I heard there was a movie version. Well more of a TV version. The acting was terrible. I think it was a PG show, had it been TV-14 it could have been much better.

I expected this to be exactly like the book, but it wasnt. Even the ending was different. The ending in the book was good, the final few chapters were great but in the show they rushed through the ending. Thats what stinks about this whole idea. had ot been a straight to dvd movie, it could have been better and they could have had more time. TV only gives you some 20 minutes for a half hour show and that is not nearly enough time to really bring the book to life.",1315526400,2,697,4.0071942446043165
898215,5,6304563752,"I've always loved the Goosebump movies, They're not so gory or bloody like the slasher movies. I like to have the grandkids over during the Halloween season and watch a goosebump episode. ""Welcome to Dead House"" is probably my favorite along with the ""Haunted Mask"". R.L. Stine does a very good job in his writings in that I'm interested in his movies from the time it starts and all the way to the end.",1263686400,2,403,4.45945945945946
898293,4,6304563752,"In the early 1990s, R.L. Stine's ""Goosebumps"" books were a huge publishing phenomena especially with elementary and middle school students.  The books were so popular that a television series based upon the books was developed.  Taking a cue from shows such as THE TWILIGHT ZONE and TALES FROM THE CRYPT, each episode was preceded and concluded with an introduction from R.L. Stine himself usually ending with a twist on the tag-line for the books that ""viewers beware, you're in for a scare"".

WELCOME TO DEAD HOUSE originally aired as a two-part episode during Goosebumps 2nd season in 1996-97.  The episode has now been combined and is featured here on this DVD.  Even though this episode came late in the 2nd season, it's based upon the first Goosebumps book ever. After the recent unemployment of their father, the Benson family moves to the town of Dark Falls, a place where the sun rarely shines.  Before anyone even enters their new house, daughter Amanda sees some strange things in the house and gets a creepy vibe.  Strange events start to happen.  At times it seems like there's something or someone trying to get in the house, but then it seems there's something trying to warn Amanda to get her family away.

WELCOME TO DEAD HOUSE does a pretty good job of following the book on which it is based, with one major exception.  There are some images that younger viewers might find frightening, but other than that the DVD is pretty safe and is something that family's might enjoy watching together for a few chills and thrills.",1239062400,,1539,4.773584905660377

898295,5,6304563752,"Welcome to dead house is my all-time favorite goosebumps movie ever! The movie is about a family of four moves into a house in Dark Falls. But,as soon as they move into Dead House,weird things start happening. Their parents don't believe them. Amanda keeps seeing people in their house. For example,Amanda saw Ray in their house and then she met him. Then came a girl who looked dead telling Amanda to get away. You must buy it!!!",1168732800,2,430,4.597402597402597
898296,4,6304563752,"Welcome to Dead House is a pretty good family horror edition of Goose Bumps with some genuine, but not too intense scares for young one.  A family of four moves into an old house in a town called Dark Falls.  The name Dark Falls is appropriate as it always seems to be dark in the town.  Even when the sun is out, the large, overgrown trees seem to always block it out.  Josh and Amanda are the two kids that immediately have bad feelings about the town.  They meet up with some other kids in town who act very strange and are very pale.

Of course the parents are typical, unbelieving parents who dismiss the kid's as just having bad dreams or the like.  But the whole family will soon learn the tragic secret of Dead falls and of the hazardous chemical accident that forever changed the town years before.  The film moves pretty well and provides a true sense of creepiness about the town and the new house the family is in.  It's one you can watch with the whole family.",1138233600,15,973,4.302197802197802

One day while looking for her lost dog, Petey, Amanda hears voices in the cemetery. Voices that sound very hungry.
