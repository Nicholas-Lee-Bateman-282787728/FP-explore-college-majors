8124856,3,B000FNPF7U,"This was a big hit in India upon first release in 1984, as it was reportedly the first 3-D movie released there. In 1988, much of the film was reshot and new sequences added, and it enjoyed new success. It's this revamped version that is featured on the DVD release, however, it is presented in flat 2-D form only, robbing the film of it's only real asset. The DVD is widescreen and English subtitles are an option, though I can't say they made the film any easier to follow!",1201824000,,475,4.348314606741573
