1425525,5,B00005IA83,"First of all I want to say that Xtina has one of the best voices out there right now.  This DVD is so much better than her first!  She sings her heart out in every song.  My favorites are:
So Emotional:  She sings this song with so much soul.  It is 10x's better than the album version.  And Lil' Bow Wow puts glitter on an already star-studded performance.
At Last:  Christina tears this song up.  It's the best version live that I've seen her do.  She holds her notes longer, and sounds a bit like Ms. Etta herself on certain parts of the song.
Climb Every Mountain:  I love Christina's range and pitch in this performance.  The gospel choir compliments her talent.  I would love to see more of this from her in the future.
Alright Now:  Christina proves that she can light up the stage without the back-up dancers.  She tore up this rock classic, and sounded great doing it!
Merry Christmas, Baby:  What can I say?  No other young pop singer can sing the blues like Ms. Aguilera.  This performance was incredible.
Overall the DVD is well worth every dime.  This is the perfect item for any Christina collection.  I promise you won't be upset that you purchased this DVD.",991785600,18,1173,4.44811320754717
1425526,5,B00005IA83,"Ten times better than ""Genie Gets Her Wish"", this DVD features Christina live in concert with a big band and orchestra complimenting her performance as she takes you through her pop hits, her Spanish album, and Christmas selections.
This DVD only reiterates the fact that Christina truly has great vocal range, not only in highs and lows, but also in style.  In Christina's concert performances, her vocals are pure and live with minimal pre-recorded supporting tracks.  You watch and listen for the vocal performance, not the supporting pop effects tracks and pop melody.
If you have seen ""Genie Gets Her Wish"", you may notice that Christina's demeanor is more mature in this DVD, especially in the way she speaks.  However, her playfulness shows through her performance.
The audio mix includes a 5.1 surround-sound track, which was not available on Christina's previous DVD.  However, this DVD does not feature the American music video of ""Come On Over Baby"", which I would have expected on this DVD release.  It does include four music videos from her Spanish album release, and the Spanish version of ""Come On Over Baby"" is on this DVD.  I should mention that the Spanish music videos are just re-edited versions of the American release with all the shots replaced where Christina sings (where her lips wouldn't match).  The dance and beauty shots are for the most part intact.
The DVD is 65 minutes long, with enough pop selections to satisfy the teeny bopper fans and several other great selections not available on the same recording.  The Christmas selections are nice, but it's kind of strange to watch them and be transported to December in the middle of June.  Overall, this DVD is a must-have and is well worth the price for every Xtina fan!",991612800,14,1753,4.89527027027027
1425527,5,B00005IA83,"This 2nd video of Christina Aguilera is much, much better than her 1st video. It has better production, 4 music videos and of course, actual undubbed concert footage.  There is a considerable amount of speaking done by Christina Aguilera here. She talks eloquently on her music before the start of almost every song in the concert (and quite a lot she addresses to the audience!). In fact, I found her demeanour to be mostly that of being earnest and down-to-earth; not much of the coquettish diva attitude surfaced. She seemed like one ""mature"" musician out of the multitude of teen acts out there.  The selection of songs here was very good. Not only are there the usual picks from the albums, Christina Aguilera also performs ""At Last"", ""Climb Every Mountain"" and ""Al Right Now"", all of which are not found on her commercial CD releases. Her voice was in tip-top condition - she hit the high notes especially well in the ballads and there were interesting improvisations to some of her songs (e.g. I Turn To You has a more soulful ending). The duet with Brian McKnight, however, was a bit uncalled for. Brian McKnight sounded like he was imitating Christina Aguilera's vocal style and was overusing his falsetto tones. Interspersed between the concert performances, are short off-stage footages of Christina Aguilera with her mother, the fliming site of ""Come On Over"" music video, and other miscellaneous stuff, very much similar to what's found on her 1st video.
As a Christina Aguilera fan, I have not regretted a single bit buying this video. It is a MUST-HAVE if you like Christina Aguilera.",991094400,5,1599,4.875

If you have a good surround system (I have a real theater), you'll think you're sitting in a club watching her.  She's just amazing.  This CD was OK, but just not even close to the same quality.

1425538,5,B00005IA83,"Funny how time flies. Seems like it was just yesterday that most of us were freaking about Y2K (I seriously had nightmares after watching The Omega Code!). Now we're already a decade into the New Millenium. Alot has changed in that time so how about a trip down memory lane?

Originally aired as a one hour Christmas special on ABC in late 2000, My Reflection features a concert from then 19 year old pop songstress Christina Aguilera performing a mix of her early hits, nice covers, and a few Christmas songs. A short home movie clip of little Chrissy performing a spirited cover of Whitney Houston's Where Do Broken Hearts Go? at a talent show opens the set followed by a brief intro of the singer explaining why Christmas is one of her favorite times of the year.

The first half of the Mulan single Reflection is followed by enthusiastic renditions of a Middle Eastern flavored Genie in a Bottle, sassy Come on Over Baby (All I Want Is You), and R&B tastic What a Girl Wants. Lil' Bow Wow (back when he was really really lil') jumps aboard for a slinky, jazzier sounding So Emotional before Christina takes back the spotlight with an impressive, at times oversung, take of Etta James' 1961 standard At Last and the choir assisted Climb Every Mountain from The Sound of Music. She also touches on her Latin roots with the smoky ballad Contigo en la Distancia (With You At A Distance) and fiery uptempo Falsas Esperanzas (False Expectations). Christmas tunes like the bluesy Merry Christmas, Baby with the legendary Dr. John, a soulful version of Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas with Brian McKnight, and another Bow Wow duet Christmas Time close the set.

Excerpts of Christina's MTV Diary special as well as a short behind the scenes look at the making of the Come On Over Baby music video pepper the concert. Extras include videos of Spanish versions of Genie in a Bottle (Genio Atrapado), I Turn to You (Por Siempre Tu), Come On Over (Ven Conmigo), and the video for The Christmas Song in English.

The nostalgia hit me like a ton of bricks. Everything from Christina's red streaked blond hair, Bratz doll inspired outfits, and slightly faux ""ghettofied"" accent (this was the beginning of her Xtina transition) made me chuckle. Some of the choreography and set-ups are cheesy, but this is decade old teen pop we're talkin' about. Pop My Reflection in if you're ever in need of a smile or a good time.",1287187200,2,2412,4.681603773584905

Sometimes I don't even know who I am as a person or what have I become. I have always been a fun outgoing person with alot of happiness, at this point in my life I am so unsure about myself. I feel so unsecure in this world, unloved, cant trust anyone and don't believe people half of the time, because I am afraid. I am also the biggest person who worries alot.

1425540,4,B00005IA83,"Once in a while you get the chance to see the rise of a Global Super Star and soon-to-become-a-Legend singer like Christina Aguilera. This concert was flawless, perfect, one step away from Madonna's/Mariah's/Whitney's top concert ever. The reason?

 If there's anything anyone can denny is that this girl can truely sing!. Come on guys, she can sing! And she's an amazing performer. Now if you prefer dancing, or seeing 'singers' dancing like back-up dancers then buy Britney Spears concerts, which have great dancing an all that stuff!

 But if you want some real hits and some great singing buy this DVD. From Christina's sweetest era. Most of the songs are nowadays classics. The downside of this album is that there are too many ballads. I love them, but almost 4 one next to the other may get you out of the mood.

 Apart from that this album is really an outstanding concert. From Early XTINA years!. 4 out of 5 stars!",1212624000,,924,4.708074534161491

1425542,5,B00005IA83,"But still very good.

I bought this DVD just some days ago and it amazed me.

Christina gives an entertaining show where she both sings and dances, and doesn't lypsinch at all.

The fast songs are catchy and the low ones are beautifully sung, with strong emotions and the usual powerful voice of Christina.

Christina can sing, Christina can dance, Christina can entertain us, she may not be the bestest artist of our generation, but she is surely underrated and deserves a lot of credits.

Maybe her look and especially her hair were not that good, but well a singer is supposed to sing in the first place and I didn't really care about what she looked like.",1137196800,2,659,4.5508474576271185
1425543,5,B00005IA83,"This Christmas Special is a must have if you're a Christina fan or if you think shes untalented give it a look to see just how talented she really is.

Not only does Christina sing her hit songs, ""Genie in a Bottle,"" ""What a Girl Wants,"" and ""I Turn To You,"" she also sings some Christmas classics also on her christmas album, My Kind of Christmas.

Christina also sings some songs that aren't on her cds like ""Climb Every Mountain,"" from The Sound of Music, one of Christina's favorite movies. Also included: ""Alright Now,"" and Etta James' ""At Last.""

The Christmas songs she sings are ""Merry Christmas Baby,"" ""Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas,"" and her song ""Christmas Time,"" which is new on her Christmas cd, My Kind of Christmas.

Not only does Christina sing in english but she sings two of her Spanish songs ""Contigo En La Distanica,"" and ""Falsas Espernazas.""

Unlike most of her pop contempararies, she puts on an overall good quality show. One thing I enjoy most about her concerts are her stage costumes, they are so freakin' cute! This one isn't as good as Stripped: Live in the UK, which I strongly recommend, but it's a great show & her vocal performance is top notch. It's very endearing to see her in her more innocent days & it shows you how far she's come from then to the woman she is today.",1103932800,3,559,4.384615384615385

She performs songs off her ""Christina Aguilera"", ""My Kind Of Christmas"", & ""Mi Reflefo"" albums, and some other songs not featured on them.  Lil` Bow Wow appeares in 2 songs.  Dr. John is featured in a Christmas song and Brian McKnight duets to a Christmas song with Christina.  This is probably one of the best concerts. . . .ever!  It is full of great songs, NO LIP-SYNCHING, lots of fireworks, hot;cool settings, & CHRISTINA's FABULOUS VOICE! (...)She is amazing & the only other people that can TIE in with her are Jessica Simpson, Mariah Carey, & Whitney Houston.  Buy this-it is extraordinary.

My favorite performance, by far on this DVD, in order are ""Falsas Esperasas"", ""All right now"", ""Climb Every Mountain"", and so on and so forth. With this DVD, you venture out of the old Sugar coated desolate pop songs. You dig deeper and experience songs you want to cherish for a long time.

Though hearing Christina sing live these days is as pleasant as nails scratching a blackboard, she sings her hits nicely on this Christmas special. There are your classic Christina (or X-Tina as she likes to be called) songs, What A Girl Wants, Genie In A Bottle, Come On Over Baby etc. There is excitement from the crowd and there is a special guest on So Emotional- stupid mouse Bow Wow formally known as Lil' Bow Wow. Though she sings I Turn To You horribly on here, the other hits sound pretty good. I wish someone would tell her that her live singing is atrocious these days. Have you heard her attempting to sing Fighter live? Geesh. The Christmas songs on here aren't even worth looking at. It's pathedic, except maybe the last one called Christmas Time. And she has destroyed one of my favorite songs, Climb Every Mountain. Why oh why? My summary is that she sings most of her hits well but the holiday stuff and the covers are extremely boring and extremely don't-waste-my-time-like. At least she's wearing clothes which is something that her street walker mentality these days fails to contemplate. Oh, if only we could get back to her days of common sense....",1070582400,,1221,4.657407407407407

Christina Aguilera's ""Bubblegum pop"" stage with Genie in a Bottle (one of my favorite songs) and ""Come on Over"" (another favorite) and Christina is now a woman and showing that in her ""Stripped"" songs.

1425564,4,B00005IA83,"With this concert, Christina has proven that she will be on of the greatest singers of our generation. Maybe many people don't see it yet, but trust me, Christina Aguilera is a legend waiting to be seen. So why 4 stars?Well, first of all, when Christina was speaking, I felt she was rather fake, as though she had learned the lines, and was being told what to say, instead of just speaking from the heart. I'm also not a fan of her teen pop hits, so that part of the concert didn't interest me. But other than that, I am completely speechless, and in utter amazement. Her voice is just extraordinary. Better than Mariah's, better than Whitney's,just one of the best voices I've ever heard in my life. If you want to hear a phenoemenon live just buy this dvd. And if you're not a fan of the music Christina was performing back then, don't worry,because Christina performs only a few of her teen pop hits, and I must say she does make them very enjoyable. But the true beauty of the concert comes after Christina has re-hashed her chart toppers. Belting out classic old songs, and singing Christmas,traditionals, Christina makes it all about the voice, and not about the show, or the choreography, or the special effects. While Christina oversings frequently, do not let that set you off, because, it's some damn good oversinging;no doubt with this concert you get to see all that she can do. Climb Every Mountain just brings tears to my eyes. She sings it with so much power, just regal over the gospel choir. Alright Now-Darn, she just tears it up! Contigo En La Distancia is just gorgeous. A beautiful, Latin tinged ballad performed in Spanish. Without a doubt, her vocals on this song should get your attention-so much emotion. Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas-She sounds wonderful, but Brian Mcnight just ruins the song with his off-key wailings. Merry Christmas Baby- Christina an sure do those old-time blues well. But the highlight of the entire concert, what makes this entire dvd worth the price, what makes you forget about every single thing you've ever disliked about Christina Aguilera, is her rendition of the Etta James classic, At Last. Can you feel the soul, the range, the voice,all the feeling. You can tell she puts her all into this song, and this performance just leaves me in disbelief;every now and then I have to listen to it again and again, just to make sure I didn't dream that someone could sing like that. Nothing I said is an exageration, and I guess you really do have to buy it to understand why I feel the way I do, because no matter how much I ramble, on and on, nothing even begins to describe the sheer phenomenon which is Christina Aguilera.",1047772800,6,2684,4.640756302521009

1425567,5,B00005IA83,"I knew this girl could sing, but after watching this DVD, I'm convinced that she has the best young voice in the universe.  Aside from having stellar pipes, Christina also shows us a diverse vocal style, poised stage persona, muture admiration for older genres of music and their practitioners, and a great rapport with the audience.  I'm a fan of hers now.  [I only wish this disc ran a lot longer than 65 minutes].
Aside from fourteen solidly performed songs, there is also some behind-the-scenes video footage, excerpts from interviews, and some well spoken on-stage commentary from Christina herself.  The balance is tipped heavily in favor of the performance (my preference), but the in-between stuff is interesting without being overly indulgent.  Christina shows great poise, both while singing and while addressing the viewers (this performance first aired on television as a Christmas special).  I also loved her stage presence:  young, but not silly; mature, but not uppity.  Even her numerous outfits have a good balance of flair and simplicity, with the midriff-baring ones being [thankfully] more youthful than sleazy.
Everyone knows how well Christina can carry a tune, so there's no need to say much beyond how impressive are her clarity of voice and flourish-filled improvising.  In my opinion, the most amazing display of her vocal prowess comes through in ""At Last,"" a bluesy number she dedicated to Etta James.  Impressive.  Two of the songs are sung in Spanish, and Christina does a rather admirable job of phrasing the lyrics in what is actually not her native tongue.  Just another facet of this talented young woman.  By the way, she also dances pretty well.  The duets with Lil Bow Wow, Dr. John, and Brian McKnight are a tiny bit of a distraction, but still entertaining.
The concert video direction is very good, with the cameras staying trained on the performers and alternating between close-ups and wider angle views.  There are also four bonus videos, three of which are Spanish versions of mainstream hits.
Overall, you're bound to enjoy this DVD immensely.",1017532800,,2088,5.0821114369501466

1425579,5,B00005IA83,"There are so many pop princesses out there that sometimes it's hard to tell the difference, but the one thing about Christina Aguilera is that she stands alone because of her amazing gift. Her bombastic powereful voice. Performing live her hits and Christmas favorites she proves she is one of the few artists who can sing live and sound incredible. She has so much energy and emotion that it is a thrill to watch her. The most amazing moment comes when she performs Climb Every Mountin backed by a Gospel Choir. A gorgeous rendition that sent chills up and down my spine. Other highlights include I Turn To You, Falsas Esperanzas, and Reflection. Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas is the duet she performs with Brian McKnight is the only low point as the two seem like they are trying to outsing each other, but they do sound good. All Christina fans should own this and all should watch this to hear one of the most talented artists in the music industry today.",1003363200,4,968,4.601156069364162
1425580,5,B00005IA83,"Sorry for not speak English well. Christina Aguilera my favorite teen pop sensation! Not just a great model and good singer, she is also very emotional. When brother Jin Leung take me to see her show at amphitheatre, Christina almost make me cry with comedy skills and makeup. This DVD exactly like that show. Even in July Christina make me wish Christmas returns with ""Merry Christmas Baby"" with her father John Aguilera.",996364800,2,422,4.875

1425583,5,B00005IA83,This tape is very good.  It actually showcases her talent.  I like to do aerobics to music that has a beat and this tape definitely does.,993513600,,137,4.230769230769231
1425584,5,B00005IA83,"It would be easy to typecast Christina Aguilera as a teen phenomenon, but one viewing of this DVD should convince even the most anti-teen singer skeptics to realize the simple fact that her voice is one of the best in music today.  This video, which is a compilation of her big pop hits, Christmas classics, cuts from her less radio-saturating Spanish-language album and a few choice covers is a view into Christina's ability to do what she does best - sing live.
She is lumped in with Britney Spears, but her vocal talent far exceeds that of her Britney and their other peers.  Her cover of the Etta James classic ""At Last"" not only shows she has the voice, but the soul to go along with it.  While other reviewers have commented negatively on her sometimes overly-theatrical vocal acrobatics, it's amazing to watch a young singer discover the power and range of her own voice.  She does so on this DVD.
Few performers can match the quality of their studio recordings when performing live, and even fewer can exceed it.  Christina Aguilera exceeds it, and we can only hope that she will continue to assert her artistic nature and branch out beyond the quick success of bubble gum pop and into bigger and better genres.
Whitney and Mariah - watch out!",992736000,32,1251,4.642533936651584
1425585,5,B00005IA83,"In Christina Aguilera's first full length televised concert special MY REFLECTION which aired on ABC in December of 2000, the young singer proves why she is the star that she is today. With a voice that rivals any of the greatest female pop singers of the past century (i.e., Barbra Streisand, Whitney Houston, Celine Dion, Mariah Carey etc.. ), Christina far outshines any competing young divas like Britney Spears, Brandy, Shakira, Ashanti or Jessica Simpson. In this concert Christina performs her #1 hits like Genie In A Bottle, What A Girl Wants and Come On Over Baby (All I Want Is You) with superior vocals and a splashy array of intense choreography. Also she does other hits off her multi-platinum debut CD, ""Reflection"", ""So Emotional"" and ""I Turn To You"". But its the other songs featured on the concert that truly display Christina's immense talent and impressive vocal range. Her version of Julie Andrews' ""Sound Of Music"" classic, Climb Ev'ry Mountain is the centerpiece of the entire concert in my opinion. Sang with full bravado and a passionate delivery, Christina's soaring performance of the tune literally brings tears to my eyes every time I see it. Also included is her cover of the Etta James blues classic ""At Last"" which she once again brings home with the same intensity and class as the incomparable Miss James. Several of the tracks off of Christina's smash debut Latin CD are included, the ballad ""Contigo En La Distancia"" and the beat heavy, dance track ""Falsas Esperanzas"". Along with a cover of rock classic ""All Right Now"" and several selections from her Christmas CD including ""Merry Christmas Baby"" (with Dr. John), ""Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas"" featuring Brian McKnight and ""Christmas Time"" with Lil' Bow Wow . Christina delivers to her fans a gift that will stand the test of time as a testament to her amazing talent. Buy this DVD as soon as possible you won't regret it for a moment, Christina's voice will give you chills and leave you in amazement.",992649600,3,2000,4.885294117647059
1425586,5,B00005IA83,"If you are already a christina fan, I know you will buy this DVD. But if you are not, just give her a chance. Watch this DVD, especially the songs ""at last"" and ""climb every mountain"", and you will surely change your opinion. This is a TV special, aired on christmas, in which christina sings singles from her debut album, as well as some songs in spanish, from her album ""mi reflejo"". The show is great, and christina has the opportunity to get in contact with her fans, introducing and explaining each song she sings.
I may say I'm impressed with her powerful vocals and her dance routines. She is surely a young diva, and it's great to see audience reacting to her greatest hits, such as ""genie in the bottle"", ""Come on over"" and ""I turn to you"". In this DVD you will also see backstage scene and short interviews with christina. There's also a making of for the video ""come on over"".
On the extra area of this DVD, you will also find 3 spanish videos plus the christmas song, featured in her first homevideo/DVD. This DVD really deserves 5 stars!",992649600,,1050,4.44559585492228

7938128,4,B00005IA83,"I've been watching her My Reflection concert on Youtube yesterday and now I can kinda see what people have been saying about her over singing. She did it quite alot in those performances. ""whhoooooooaaaaaaa ooooooohhhh oooo..woooo"" ""ooooooooo yea yea yea yeaaaaaaaah"". I think she's one of those performers who be really feeling their own performances, lol. I know she has soul in her...but it's like DAMN GIRL, control yourself!!! Nevertheless, my favorite performances would be Reflection, So Emotional, I Turn To You, Climb Ev'ry Mountain, and Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas. Merry Christmas, Baby was good as well. I think this DVD is good and decent for new Christina fans, but for old time fans like myself my personal favorite would be ""Stripped: Live in The UK"" were you see more energy and more concept development.",1410998400,,832,5.08029197080292
