4885208,5,B005SH6482,"Batman the Brave and the Bold was an excellent series, and a worthy successor to BTAS,and justice league. The purists out there, angry that it wasn't the grim dark series they've been howling for, ignored it and ushered in its untimely demise. Thankfully, enough open minded fans have purchased the previous sets, making sure that WB continues to release them.

Make no mistake; if WB feels that people aren't interested in this series, they will stop production on the box sets. I wait for the day that they give this excellent show the respect it deserves, namely full Blu-ray seasons with extras, but until that day comes these sets will have to do.

To be fair, you get a nice amount of content for very little money. This set comes with fourteen action packed episodes, guaranteed to satisfy. From Uncles Sam showing bad guys the stars and stripes, to an epic battle against the lord of Apokolips, Darkseid, this set doesn't disappoint. No, it isn't in HD,and no, there still aren't any extras. If enough of us buy these, very worthwhile, sets though, that sends the message to WB that we like this series and are willing to pay for it. The hammers of justice have lost none of their potency, and you'll love watching every swing they take.",1333065600,2,1245,4.680365296803653
4885209,5,B005SH6482,"I love this set of episodes. WHY?  More Bat-Family member either make their first appearance or a return appearance.

Batgirl(Barbara Gordon) is feature in a teaser helping Batman clipped the wings of
Killer Moth.  Which is a shout out to her first appearance in the comics in which Batgirl saves Bruce Wayne from Killer Moth.
She also appears next with Nightwing in the Batwoman episode.

Batwoman. Not quite the original Kathy Kane-Batwoman from the late 50's/early 60's comic but this Batwoman wears the same custome but her real id is Katrina Moldoff.
Named after Batman artist Sheldon Moldoff who recently passed away.
Riddler is the main villian but The Spinner and Tiger Shark get their 15 seconds of fame.

Bat-Mite Returns and he accidently gives the Joker his powers. YIKES.
Bad news for Batman.
Harley Quinn makes her first appearance. Way different then her B:TAS appearance.
Ten-Eye Man also gets his 30 seconds of fame thanks to Bat-Mite.

Vicki Vale make her first appearance on the teaser for ""The Battle of the Superheroes"".  Batman and Robin dress as mummies to fight King Tut.
In the main feature Superman takes center stage. Lots of great homages to the
Superman comics of the 60's.

Knights of Tomorrow is a special episode as we get a peek at a possible future for Batman.  Bruce and Selina marry and have a son.

Bat-Mite Hosts a special episode that features Batman and Robin in different forms.
First up is a MAD parody Batboy and Rubin.
Bat-Manga is 2nd with Mr Bader voicing the villian, Lord Death Man.
Finally its another Batman-Scooby Doo crossover with a special appearance by Weird Al.

Another teaser I like was the Rainbow Batman vs Firefly and his Rainbow Creature.
Lots of FUN stuff.

All in All is a great set of episodes.  Solid 'A'.
Beware you might shed a tear or two at the end of DOOM PATROL episode. <SNIFF>
But then you will laugh out loud what happens to Batman and Batwoman. HAHAHAHA",1332892800,10,1929,4.7395209580838324
4885210,4,B005SH6482,"Batman and his ""hammers of justice"" are back for more heroic action in Batman: The Brave and the Bold - Season Two, Part Two. Gotham City is Batman's (Diedrich Bader) home town, but he often goes beyond its city limits in his crusade to uphold justice. Though Batman relies on his cunning, resourcefulness and vast supply of gadgets to save the day, he's not above of having a little superhero backup close when the Earth is threatened from such formidable foes like Starro and Darkseid. In this collection of 14 action-packed episodes, Batman teams up with Superman, the Flash, Booster Gold, Bwana Beast, Firestorm, Plastic Man, the Freedom Fighters, the Doom Patrol and the Marvel Family against evildoers from Earth and beyond. Based on the comic book series published by DC Comics, this light adaptation offers an amusing mix of old-school comic book action and refreshing humor. The 2-disc DVD set includes such standout episodes like the two-parter The Siege of Starro!, Requiem for a Scarlet Speedster!, Emperor Joker!, The Criss Cross Conspiracy!, The Knights of Tomorrow!, Darkseid Descending!, Battle of the Superheroes! and Bat-Mite Presents: Batman's Strangest Cases!.

If you enjoy Silver Age comics, then Batman: The Brave and the Bold - Season Two, Part Two is another fine addition to your DCAU superhero collection. All 14 episodes of the hit Cartoon Network series are presented in 1.78:1 widescreen format. Like the previous DVDs, both picture quality and 2.0 Dolby Digital Stereo are pretty solid. Except for the digital comic for Batman: The Brave and the Bold #15 and a few trailers, there are no supplemental material on this 2-disc set. Overall, Batman: The Brave and the Bold - Season Two, Part Two is a pretty simple but well recommended bargain purchase, and scores a ""B-"".",1332633600,8,1800,5.0606060606060606
4885211,3,B005SH6482,"When I ordered this DVD, I checked online to make sure the unaired-in-America episode ""The Mask of Matches Malone"" was going to be included. There was even an interview stating that the episode would indeed be included. Its yet another ""jerk the fans around"" move by DC's Animation department - and it really stinks.

The episodes are good. No special features, though. (Well, nothing of worth, anyway.) These DVDs really could have used some commentary, especially since so many obscure characters appear in the show. I certainly would have liked to have heard some of the creators talk about the show. Although DC has never been ""that"" good with doing commentary -- Batman and Superman DVD sets usually only have 3 or 4 episodes with commentary. But this seems like an abdication, to simply not even try anymore. Who knows - maybe the DVDs are cheaper because of this.

There is one episode on the disk I wasn't expecting, because it aired as if it where the premiere of season 3. The episode where Superman fights Batman! There are so many wonderful references to Silver Age Superman wackiness - that you simply could not do in any other animated series.

There's also a silver lining, regarding the unaired Matches Malone episode. They now are saying it will be included on the Season 3 DVD set. Here's hoping they aren't lying again!",1332460800,13,1338,4.783549783549783

4885227,5,B005SH6482,"I am a fan of ""Batman: the Animated Series,"" so any Batman cartoon is evaluated through that lens.  Certainly does not have the grit or realism of that series, but for its purpose, it does it well.  Funny, well written, and good story lines.  Just don't expect the same level as you would from The Animated Series.",1399507200,,314,4.473684210526316
4885228,3,B005SH6482,"While this show wasn't bad, it sure as heck wasn't a masterpiece, and it mostly just got old after the first season I thought, perhaps using other villains more rather than as cameos would have made this show in general better. Overall a pretty good show.

Batman: The Brave and the Bold - Season Two, Part Two *** out of *****

Violent Content: 3/10 - Strong Stylized Action Violence.",1394150400,,385,4.565217391304348
4885229,5,B005SH6482,"This show was great, and should still be airing.  It's so much fun to see a Batman that can smile.  Of course, it's not all fun and games here, since there are episodes like ""The Last Patrol"" featuring almost the same story as the original final Doom Patrol story back in the 60s.  It stacks up just fine with any Batman: The Animated Series episode you want to name.",1393632000,,367,4.2898550724637685

4885242,5,B005SH6482,I really wanted to finish my collection of Brave and the Bold. I've enjoyed watching it on TV. Its a shame the series didn't last longer.,1381795200,,137,4.3076923076923075
4885243,5,B005SH6482,"I love this TV show because it shows how even superheroes make mistakes and own up to them. Even they aren't perfect. I also like how this show has actual plots and characters you care about. Marvel seems to be in it for the money, but DC Comics seems to care about the relation between the viewer and the characters on the show; making sure you can connect to some of the characters in a personal way.",1374364800,,402,4.233766233766234
4885244,5,B005SH6482,"I like watching this as much as my four year old son. Great sensibility: humorous, not too dark, something for the kids, something for the dads, sort of retro animation, has the meta/self referential approach and is not hyper-violent with a million smash-cut edits like other supposed kids shows. In fact, it seems really to downplay the fighting. They even made Aquaman likable. I like this version of the batman cartoon better than the others. I was raised on the old super friends vs. legion of doom shows but gravitated toward the marvel characters in the comics growing up. The real reason I'm writing a review is to say I've seen all three seasons and liked 'em enough to buy them on dvd, and part of that is the fact that I can watch this with my son and re-watch them.",1368489600,,776,4.51063829787234
4885245,4,B005SH6482,"Season 2 part 2 was pretty good, I bought Season 3 the final season to end the collection.  Season 3 was weaker than seasons 1 and 2, as I will mention in Season 3, but still mark 4 stars for all the sets because it was good enough for me.",1367366400,,239,3.78
4885246,4,B005SH6482,"This was my personal favorite of the may animated Batman series made since the 80's.  It is a light-hearted but not overly campy Silver Age Batman combined with just about every major and minor super hero or super villain in the DC universe.  Even fans of the much more serious DCAU will love these.  TDK and TDKR fans may not enjoy them so much without a child or 2 present...

I hoped for some additional content with the DVD set but sadly there is none.  This is the only reason I did not give this 5 stars, however I do like that the DVD's load immediately to the DVD menu and not the obligatory commercials that can not be skipped.  I thank WB for acknowledging that we already spent the money to purchase these and deserve to be spared the advertising push.  If only more DVD distributors would take note.",1367107200,,811,4.366666666666666
4885247,5,B005SH6482,"I am a huge fan of Batman in many of his incarnations (and comic books as well). I am also a father who enjoys sharing this love with my child. I first brainwashed my daughter into loving Batman with the old Adam West TV show which she LOVES. I then continued with Batman the Animated Series, which is considered to be THE definitive interpretation of Batman on TV. It was a little dark for her, but she enjoyed it to a point.

When this show first came on I was at first a little dissappointed by the degree of campiness, but they won me over with the numerous obscure guest heroes. Bwana Beast, the Metal Men, Bat-Mite, Kamandi, the Original Omac, and so many many more... I quickly fell in love with this show, and so did my daughter. There are many nods thorughout the series to old tv shows (The Plastic Man animated series) Old obscure comic book stories (Batman saves Abe Lincoln from a robotic John Wilkes Booth on an Alternate Earth.) So may references I am not sure I caught them all.

This series is a little silly. They mix music and comedy with Batman.  It deliberately chooses weird second or third tier villians for Batman to fight. It mixes 1960's campy Batman comics with the current DCU Canon, and does it very well. Some people may not be able to unclench enough to enjoy this, BUT IT IS VERY VERY FUN! In my opinion, it ranks just below the Batman Animated Series. Batman does not always HAVE to be dark and brooding.",1361923200,,1437,4.394736842105263

4885250,5,B005SH6482,"Camp, fun and a great nod and love letter to the silver age way of story telling for comics.
BBATB is a show that indulges in the wacky antics of that time in comics that had fun with its source material and not take it so so seriously and make it dark and morbid.
The show does occasionally travel into serious tone stories but never loses its feeling of a show that makes uses of the greater DC Comic universe.
it uses a lot of DC Comic characters not just Batman.
We get to see a revision of Aquaman that has become a fan favorite [if only he got a spin-off] and we get golden age heroes like Plastic Man.
This exploration of the DCU is great for fans of the comics, cartoon lovers and those who just want to have fun.",1359849600,,721,4.084507042253521

4885252,5,B005SH6482,"This Batman series is different from others in that it brings a lot of the older superheroes back to life and you can see how they interact with others instead of just reading how they would act in certain situations. This is a really good series for someone who let's say, enjoyed watching The Superfriends.",1358726400,,308,4.618181818181818
4885253,5,B005SH6482,"As for the other parts of the series, this one was as good as advertised. Same off beat stories, music, characters, etc. Nothing to complained about. If you loved the first season and a half, you won't be disappointed with this one. My only beef with it is why does it takes so long before putting them on the market? Why go for these 4-5 episodes packages that no one is interested into and thus, retarding the apparition of those seasons - or half-season - on the market? Otherwise, everything was impeccable!

Thanks for everything! The delivery was in time and in perfect order. Really appreciated the professionalism and the diligence of your company. Thanks again!",1356566400,,670,4.775862068965517

Villains include Darksied, Mantis, The Maniaks, Felix Faust, Harley Quin and Starro the Conqueror. Guest voices include Adam West and John Wesley Shipp(the 1990's FLASH).

4885259,5,B005SH6482,"I guess it was only a matter of time before the dour Darknight Detective resurfaced (cackle away, Frank Miller). We should count ourselves lucky that for three seasons BATMAN: THE BRAVE AND THE BOLD was on the air, giving us a less brooding Caped Crusader. This DVD collection offers up the rest of the Season 2 episodes... sort of. For whatever reason, this set excludes ""The Mask of Matches Malone!"" (which instead will be inserted in the Season 3 set). In its stead, we get an episode that was broadcast in Season 3: ""Battle of the Superheroes!""

While, tonally, this series steeps itself in DC's breezier, sillier Silver Age, and while it presents a protagonist who at times channels the Tick in his crimefighting aphorisms (although Bats is no Aquaman in that regard), it doesn't shirk from addressing darker themes. Such as the death of several heroes. Although most of Season 2 trots out stand-alone adventures, there is one overarching thread, and it concerns that epic space marauder Starro. Lend an ear to Starro's bit of braggadocio: ""For untold eons I have roamed the cosmos, conquering and devouring all who cross my path. Those few who resisted my will eventually succumbed. Thus it has been and shall ever be."" As depicted in previous episodes of Season 2, one by one, most of Earth's heroes have fallen to Starro's brainwashing spores. This arc culminates tragically in ""The Siege of Starro! Parts 1 & 2.""

As usual, each episode is kicked off by a teaser segment, and this is just the showmakers throwing out this and that storyline to see which might prove popular enough to be later expanded into a full episode. One such teaser (in ""The Knights of Tomorrow!"") has the Question sneaking about on Apokalips, and this prequel pays off in ""Darkseid Descending!"" as the forces of Apokalips invade Earth.

Several episodes stand out for me, and they mostly involve Batman's sharing screen time with DC's lesser known capes. ""Requiem for a Scarlet Speedster!"" co-stars perhaps my favorite Flash, Jay Garrick (or as one of Flash's Rogues Gallery remarks: ""It's just Geezer Flash.""). ""The Criss Cross Conspiracy!"" - featuring Batwoman - is a gas as it has Batman the victim of a hilarious body swap. In ""Cry Freedom Fighters!"" a cynical Plastic Man is recruited by Uncle Sam to join his Freedom Fighters. ""Darkseid Descending"" showcases my all-time favorite incarnation of the Justice League. One of the stories in ""Bat-Mite Presents: Batman's Strangest Cases!"" has Batman teaming up with Scooby Doo. While that's not quite as awesome as Batman's hanging out with Space Ghost (Season 3's ""Bold Beginnings!""), it's almost as.

Possible plot SPOILERS now for this volume's episodes:

- ""The Siege of Starro! Parts 1 & 2"" - In the face of an impending alien invasion and with most of Earth's heroes possessed by Starro, Bats, Booster Gold, Firestorm, B'wana Beast, and Billy Batson make their last stand.

Then, Booster Gold, missing his best friend, Ted Kord, something fierce, journeys to the past to have one last adventure with the Silver Age Blue Beetle. But since this is Booster Gold, he efs up the time stream.

- ""Emperor Joker!"" - Prequel: In a homage to DETECTIVE COMICS issue #241 and BATMAN issue #134, it's Robin and Rainbow Batman versus the Firefly. Then, in a very self-aware episode, the irritating otherdimensional Bat-Mite mistakenly cedes his reality-bending powers to the Joker who then proceeds to remake the world in his own image.

- ""The Criss Cross Conspiracy!"" - Prequel: When Atom's bio-belt breaks and strands Atom and Batman in a diminished state while fighting the Bug-Eyed Bandit, can Aquaman, er, size them up?

- ""Plague of the Prototypes!"" - Prequel: During World War II, Batman joins Sgt. Rock, G.I. Robot, and Easy Company on a mission.

Featuring the voice of Adam West as Proto.

- ""Cry Freedom Fighters!"" - Prequel: With Batman unavailable, rookie hero Star Girl receives unexpected help from the new Blue Beetle against the Mantis.

- ""Darkseid Descending!"" - Prequel: Killer Frost seeks to extinguish an old flame: jock coach Ronnie Raymond (a.k.a. one half of Firestorm). Then, Batman assembles the squabbling Justice League International to fend off Darkseid's global assault on Earth.

- ""Battle of the Superheroes!"" - Prequel: From the Secret Files of the Bat-Computer: A mummy-costumed Batman and Robin put the wraps on the Pharoah and his zombie henchmen. Then, it's a World's Finest sighting as Bats visits Metropolis for a series of villain-stomping adventures with his old chum, Superman. But then the Man of Steel is exposed to red kryptonite and turns eeeeevil.

- ""Bat-Mite Presents: Batman's Strangest Cases!"" - Bat-Mite hosts a peek at three incarnations of Batman. First up is Mad magazine's parody, ""Bat Boy and Rubin.""

- ""The Malicious Mr. Mind!"" - Prequel: In present-day Gotham, Batman, Kamandi, and Dr. Canus search for an ancient artifact to defeat Misfit.

This episode is so damn cute.",1334620800,4,6856,4.953002610966058

This version has our favorite hero with a quiet toughness the Miller version doesn't have.  I really enjoy the team ups with all the classic characters.  The stand out episode was with Darkside from Jack Kirby's New Gods!  The Brave and the Bold comic book was DC's answer to Marvel Team Up.  Brave and Bold might have been concieved before Marvel did their version.  Whre else can you see Plastic Man, Robotman from the Doom Patrol, the Metal Men and many more?!!
