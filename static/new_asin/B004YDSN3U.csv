4499373,1,B004YDSN3U,"It's flashy, I grant that.  But ""ground breaking?""  Not hardly.  Still, I watched the whole thing, just to see how they did.  Answer: not so hot.

Just a few examples of errors:  the narrator said the late Stonewall Jackson was General Lee's second in command -- General Longstreet was Lee's second in command; having Ewell on a horse, rather than in the carriage he actually rode after losing his leg; Clara Barton established the Red Cross (only the American Red Cross--the Red Cross was established by Henry Dunant in Geneva, Switzerland in 1863).

Ignoring John Buford's cavalry defense until General Reynolds could get there, nothing about Hood's brigade against Chamberlain on Little Round Top, claiming all of the Confederate cavalry was missing at the beginning (just J.E.B. Stuart's cavalry, the rest were there), claiming General Joseph R. Davis was from Vicksburg (he was from Biloxi), nothing at all about the third day cavalry battle between Custer and Stuart -- the errors and omissions just piled up.

It was not totally bad.  The doctor who found his nephew dead the first day, then tended the wounded without sleep; a tip of the hat to the first military intelligence unit, coverage of Culp's Hill -- they were reasonably good.  However, this battle was too large to cover in an hour presentation (with commercial breaks), and it shows.

I'll not be buying this one.  Save your money and get Ken Burns' The Civil War, and the motion picture Gettysburg (preferably the director's cut).  They're far more accurate and emotive.",1314748800,41,1541,4.97265625
4499374,3,B004YDSN3U,"How you can produce a documentary entitled ""Gettysburg"" and completely ignore the southern flank of the battle is beyond me. Granted, the personal stories of individual soldiers are moving; however, you could demonstrate that true courage, intense fear, incredible suffering, and numbing horror existed in any battle in any time period. The film is mistitled; it is misleading to viewers who wish a comprehensive idea of what specifically occured in those three fateful days.",1310688000,27,475,5.4324324324324325
4499375,2,B004YDSN3U,"Once again, the History Channel has produced a documentary that is par for the course with their productions over the past several years--style and special effects over substance.  Like the disappointing production of last year, America: the Story of Us, this documentary on the Battle of Gettysburg is one that oversimplifies the subject, relies on generalities without substantive discussion, and favors computer graphics and big explosions over educational value.

The narration repeats the same general exclamatory statements over and over again.  How many times do we have to hear, ""this could determine the outcome of the Civil War,"" or ""this would be one of the iconic moments of the War,"" in the narrator's deep, dramatic tone?  It reminded me of the aforementioned America: the Story of Us, when they had to have a commentator say every five minutes or so, ""we are a nation of innovators,"" or ""ours is a history of struggle.""  Such repeated statements are meant to add weight and power to the piece, but instead just make it into overly exaggerated melodrama.

You can see the mark of the modern war film making style in the piece, especially given that Tony and Ridley Scott are the producers behind it.  The documentary is obviously trying to give it a Saving Private Ryan feel, with plenty of bullet impact noises, blood and grit, and even the noisy-silence sound of someone suffering shock (reminiscent of several moments with Tom Hanks character in Private Ryan).  But alas, this stylistic war film feel is not supported by an informative narrative.  This is a documentary, and thus the informative value should be at least as important as the entertainment value.

As someone who has studied the Battle of Gettysburg, and has taught college classes on the Civil War, I was also appalled by the glaring omissions of important players and events from the story.  They fail to discuss in any detail at all how the battle started. Thus, they do not discuss General John Buford's cavalry and their role in holding the high ground for the Union Army when the Confederates arrived.  On the second day's engagement, they focus on the assaults on Cemetery Ridge and Culp's Hill, but do not mention the assault on Little Round Top.  An all important player like Gouverneur K. Warren, who recognized the significance of (and lack of defenses on) Little Round Top, and called for reinforcements to hold the hill, is omitted.  If anyone turned the tide of the battle, it was Warren.  This, of course, also leads to the role played by Colonel Strong Vincent's brigade, and the included 20th Maine Regiment of Colonel Joshua Chamberlain.  The latter is one of the most fascinating characters in the Union Army at Gettysburg, but he also is omitted from the story.  On the Confederate side of this engagement, they focus all of their attention on Barksdale's Brigade, but do not mention the roll of John Bell Hood or Colonel William Oates.  No play for the Texans or the Alabamians--Mississippi's sons get all the focus of discussion.  And for the final day, with Pickett's Charge, they do not even discuss George Pickett himself in any detail.  Nor do they mention the roles played by Lewis Armistead, or any of Pickett's brigade commanders.  On the Union side, General Winfield Scott Hancock's role in holding the Union center is also overlooked.  Given the personal connection between Scott and Armistead (friends before the war), this could have been a wonderful way to put an exclamation point on the brother-against-brother nature of the American Civil War.  This may seem like nitpicking, but these people and events are so essential to the story that they should not be overlooked in any complete discussion of the Battle of Gettysburg.  At least some of them should have made it into this documentary.

There are some positive points to the documentary, and any fair assessment of the piece requires that these be mentioned.  First, the personal stories of some of the common soldiers are compelling, and do convey the emotion that those soldiers must have felt.  I felt this was especially true of the story of Amos Humiston, which is one of my favorite stories from the Battle of Gettysburg, and one I have highlighted myself in classes I have taught on the battle.  I am glad that he was one character they included in the story.  Other positive aspects of the piece are details about certain elements of the battle (weaponry, field medicine, communications).  Such details are brought home with good use of expert commentary, and effective use of the aforementioned graphics and imagery.  In this case, the stylistic filmmaking is used to great effect.

But what ultimately makes Gettysburg, overall, a failed piece, is that it fails to convey the scope of the battle, an overall narrative of the story of the battle, and favors style over important detail.  Thus, its value as an educational piece is limited.  Now, I do know the common argument in reply to this--this kind documentary could get young people interested in the topic.  My reply to that is that we do not need to reduce a documentary's informative aspects, i.e. ""dumb down,"" the piece just to have more slick production values to get the young people who watch Iron Man interested in history.  When we teach history, we should try to make it accessible to the common man, but not by appealing to the lowest common denominator.  Rather, we should aspire to the highest quality of substance and story.  Gettysburg fails to do so.",1306713600,100,5505,4.9049676025917925

Gripping, intense, brutal, and realistic, it shows a different perspective about the Battle of Gettysburg done in a more modern, realistic ""Saving Private Ryan"" style which educates as well as entertains. It is from the Ridley Scott team, so of course it has a slightly more dark violent style to it that adds to the intensity. The interviews,  photos and new computer graphics bring a new refreshing take to a story that's been done to death before, but puts it in a new light. The HISTORY CHANNEL did a great, amazing job with this. Well worth the money and highly recommended. An absolute must for any true Civil War buff.",1439164800,3,713,4.658730158730159

4499388,5,B004YDSN3U,"Many movies and documentaries have tried and tried again to develop realistic Civil War fighting scenes. What you get when you watch those films are pretty much the same: fat, heavily bearded reenactors dressed in crisp, clean uniforms bulging around their bellies as they march in perfect unison and rank. The movie will show you how the Civil War really was: groups of dirty, haggard young guys covered in filth and blood as they fight for their lives. Folks, the American Civil War was no romantic, Napoleonic-type affair; it was in fact the beginning of a new age of warfare and this movie shows it in each scene. Each battle is heart-pounding, with gritty and bloody scenes not meant for the squeamish.
Many people have criticized this video because it doesn't focus on what exactly happened and instead is just entertainment. Who cares? We have dozens of long, boring movies that tell about the Battle of Gettysburg in full detail. We don't have many videos like this that bursts the historian's romantic view of how the Civil War really was. I only wish people were more open-minded to movies like this so that the History Channel would make more...
Bottom line is: if you're looking for a movie that accurately describes what happened at Gettysburg, then skip over this movie and get Ken Burns' documentary or something. If you're searching for true accounts of what happened there that is displayed in such a vivid and graphic manner then grab this video.

4499398,4,B004YDSN3U,"Standing in stark contrast to the visual and stylistic excesses of Lee & Grant, executive producers Ridley and Tony Scott (and others) have put together an utterly fascinating film about one of the most tragic military engagements ever involving North Americans  the battle of Gettysburg.

GETTYSBURG is full of rich visuals, but the film manages to match them with a compelling story that focuses on a number of individuals who were either directly or indirectly involved in the battle.

The most heartrending of these stories involves Amos Humiston, a Union sergeant who has the distinction of being the only enlisted man to have his own monument at Gettysburg. The reason for this will really tug at your heart strings.

It seems that Humiston knew he was mortally wounded. He crawled off to die and as he slowly bled to death, he retrieved from his pocket an ambrotypean early type of photographof his three children.

His wife had sent it to Humiston after he had gone to war, never imagining the impact it would have in helping to immortalize her husbands memory.

After the battle, Humiston was found, holding the picture of his children in his death grip. Since this was the age before dog tags, rendering dead soldiers unidentifiable unless they carried something that explained who they were, the picture was the only clue as to who this soldier was.

The picture came into the possession of a volunteer physician, who, some months after the battle, decided to try to solve the mystery. Eventually newspapers published detailed descriptions of the ambrotype, since at that time they had no means of reproducing pictures.

Eventually the description reached Humistons widow, who hadnt heard of her husbands fate. She made inquiries, eventually saw the picture, and was able to confirm her husbands identity.

This is but one episode that serves to put the tragedy of the battle of Gettysburg into perspective for the modern viewer. Most people know there was great loss of life and that it changed the tide of the war. But it is the human aspect of all such stories that is the difference between an outstanding film (which this is) and just another documentary.

If you couple this GETTYSBURG documentary with watching the brilliant 1993 feature film of the same name, your experience of the tragedy of Gettysburg will surely be complete.",1397433600,2,2348,4.951653944020356
4499399,5,B004YDSN3U,"Brilliantly produced documentary on the Battle of Gettysburg. Other documentaries take a timeline approach, walking you through the three days and discussing the different places on the battlefield. This DVD focuses less on what happened at any given place and more on the incredible violence and desparation of the fighting. It takes several individuals who were part of the battle and tells their stories. Most documentaries tell the story; this one makes you feel it.

This video also explains the different types of weapons and ammunition - the minnie ball, cannister, etc. - which helps you to understand how 50,000 soldiers were killed or wounded in a small combat zone over just three days of fighting.

The video is very violent, much closer to the beginning minutes of ""Saving Private Ryan"" than any other documentary I've seen. Watching this DVD gives you a much better understanding of the battle's significance to the soldiers themselves and makes this historic battle a much more personal experience.",1384905600,5,1013,5.170731707317073

If it wasn't for the brigade's heroism and sacrifice, the Union would have probably lost the Battle of Gettysburg.  Rufus Dawes was the focus of this movie.  As it should be.  The valor of the 20th Maine at Little Round Top was, indeed, worthy of telling; but if wasn't for the Iron Brigade, the 20th would have never been in that position.  The Johnies would have gotten there first.  There are just some people who want to show off their limited knowledge by nitpicking a movie.  No movie will ever be 100% historically accurate.

4499409,3,B004YDSN3U,"As an historian who has done extensive research into Gettysburg and its participants, I realize that no one program can cover all aspects of the great battle.  Even if I accept that principle there is still no excuse for stated errors in the narration.
It is so easy to get it right that I am appalled at how often these programs get it wrong.  I give a few examples:

1.  Stonewall Jackson did NOT die in battle as stated in the program.  He was shot by his own pickets and died a month later of pneumonia.

2.  Clara Barton did NOT found the Red Cross.  That honor goes to Jean Henri Dunant of Switzerland.  Barton can only be credited with bringing the Red Cross to the US.

3.  Meade's battle formation did not see the potential value of Little Round Top, although Sickles' move forward further exposed the vulnerable weakness of the Union left flank.  Warren's quick assessment of the danger and the sacrifice of commanders like Strong Vincent and Paddy O'Rourke made the difference.

4.  While I am relieved not to hear so much about Pickett (who hated having his name attached to that disastrous charge) there was no mention of Pettigrew and Trimble, whose units sacrificed far more during the charge.

5.  And finally -- perhaps a point that only I can make -- the reference to men under Davis futilely planting a flag on the Union wall is not only without substantiation, but has been disproved by the publication of the diary written by Lt. William H. Peel, Company C of the 11th Mississippi.  Since I am the transcriber and researcher who published the diary (available on Amazon) I can state with confidence that the flag story told by Pvt. Joseph Marable was fabricated by that gentlemen for his own reasons.  There never was proof that it happened and Peel's account proves that it could not have happened.

Perhaps a future researcher will see this and pay heed.  For my own part I am so tired of the endless parade of documentaries that not only leave out essential elements, but exacerbate our national ignorance with factual fallacies and the repetition of long disproved myths.",1359504000,23,2096,4.659400544959128

The Confederate and Union Soldiers uniforms and physiques were FINALLY accurate in this version of the battle.  That is what the 1993 Movie ""Gettysburg"" seriously lacked.  In the movie ""Gettysburg"" the reenactors uniforms were meticulously clean and the reenactors in many cases were to heavy to make it accurate about the soldiers.  There was hardly any blood or horror of the battle in the movie as well.  In this DVD, made by the History Channel and the Scott Brothers, the soldiers are dirty, the Confederates hair are long (the way it truely was), the blood is shown in gruesome detail and the individual soldiers and civilian stories are quite tragic.

Those looking for the signature events of G-Burg really won't find them here.  Buford's Cavalry stand, 20th Maine, etc. are not covered at all. The first day's event start abruptly with the Iron Brigade fighting at the Railcut.  This is a soldier's look at Civil War combat intended for a general audience.  The effects are there to hook the laymen.  With Ridley Scott one has to expect this.  There is little background to the battle and only basic info. on an as need basis.  The special effects showing how destructive Minie balls were to the human frame are compelling, and mean more if you really understand the weapons involved.  The same with how Civil War Arty worked.  Nice effects, fascinating detail, but no overall picture of how it was employed or used.

This is a fast paced, cinematic DVD intended to draw the general viewer in.  Even the G-Burg fan will find some interest here in that the work tends to focus on less well known aspects of the battle.  The fighting around Culps Hill was crucial during the whole three days and tends to get little attention in most of the popular histories. Pickets Charge does get mentioned, but is covered from a very individual perspective of one or two participants.

This is an interesting, entertaining look at Civil War combat in general.  Whether at G-burg or any battle from the war.

4499416,3,B004YDSN3U,"I watched this with mixed feelings after reading the reviews... After viewing it, overall, it is okay - but misses the mark. As an amateur historian and a docent at a the Chamberlain Museum, (freely admitting my bias), I will give it a fair shake. As with most Hollywood historical productions, it is not perfectly accurate by any means. I have read many reviews which refer to the errors on the part of the reenactors,as well as some historical inaccuracies, and or omissions, and this is true, (I will not spend the time to detail them here!), but to be fair I have yet to see a Hollywood production that is perfect in this area..? Ken Burns Civil War Series is very good but not perfect, Turner's Gettysburg is excellent but gives no real attention to Culp's Hill on the second day and instead focuses on the Round Tops. So to be fair this episode repeats some of the same mistakes previously done by other productions.

What it does not do, contrary to its title, is give a good historical view of all aspects of the battle; but as one reviewer said, ""that cannot be done in a two-hour show..."", If you love the Civil War and want to watch a docudrama that covers ""all aspects"" of one of the most important, if not ""the"" most important battles of the Civil War, then this is not the show for you; but then, as much as I like it, neither does Turner's Gettysburg. As many reviewers have correctly noted you cannot talk about this engagement without talking about: Buford, Hancock,Warren, Strong Vincent, Chamberlain, Rice, etc (the list is too long to name all). You cannot cover this engagement without talking about the Round Tops, more than a name mention which is all that this production does, as well as the Wheatfield, Spangler's Spring,Devil's Den, AP Hill, John Bell Hood, Longstreet etc. This episode falls far short on this ground.

But what it does do is focus more attention to Culp's Hill and less on Round Top giving long overdue praise to the men who defended that vital hill. I have long said at the museum that the events of Little Round Top were important, but to hear some people talk, you would think that nothing else happened at Gettysburg then Little Round Top....

This movie does succeeds at giving attention to a part of the engagement that most people know nothing about, it does a great job at focusing less on the better-known officers, Chamberlain, Warren, Hancock etc, and instead focusing on the everyday soldiers that were living and dying for this country of ours. It gives decent basic coverage of such things as the important use of artillery, the developments in musketry, as well as decent maps, which Gettysburg does not do. It also has decent special effects, though CGI does not always do it for me... it is well filmed and narrated!

In short if you want historical accuracy, read a good book! If you are part of that modern generation that hates to read and you want to learn something about Gettysburg then watch this, watch Ken Burns, watch Turner's Gettysburg, only then may you ""begin"" to have a basic understanding of this battle; but just realize - Buster Kilrain is not real, and neither is everything accurate that is portrayed in Burn's Civil War - so don't expect this Gettysburg 2011 to be perfect either! I would watch this again!",1325376000,3,3289,4.636363636363637

Inaccuracies aside the part that most annoyed me is not he pc created simulations but the scenery which was either filmed in somewhere not east coast usa or in europe. The dry landscape, mountains in the background were annoying. Some of the actors appeared eastern european which kind of threw me off but ok.

All in all a well made doc series that showed a more personal perspective than other docs on the civil war. Worth the buy for the history buff.",1325116800,2,516,4.733333333333333
4499418,1,B004YDSN3U,"As a Civil War buff and reenactor for about 30 years I was looking forward to seeing this program when I saw the previews.  Unfortunately it proved to be a disappointment.  I liked the style of the film but the historical inaccuracies ruined it for me.  I don't know who they had advising them but the ""soldiers"" weren't even wearing their equipment properly.  While it wasn't a documentary the movie ""Gettysburg"" directed by Ron Maxwell is much more historically correct, if you can overlook the fact that some of us reenactors used in that film were a bit old and too well fed.",1322352000,22,579,4.592233009708738

4499421,5,B004YDSN3U,"I don't quite understand some of the critical reviews of this documentary made by the great film directors Tony & Ridley Scott. While it may contain some historical inaccuracies according viewers more knowledgeable than I, it is none the less a terrifically made film/docmentary. I liked ""Gettysburg"" the film, less so ""God's & Generals"" they are fine works on their own as is Ken Burns great PBS documentary on the Civil War. But this DVD presents a 'hybrid' if you will of those 2 styles of film making and its great in my view. It is much more 'graphic' than a Ken Burns film, but more 'dettached' and neutral with regards to the Generals/heroes presented in the theatrical fims. What you see is what happens when the film craftsmanship of fine directors like the Scott's gets applied to a documentary style film where the actors are way less important than the information. Not for everyone I'm sure but I thought this film was terrific--WAY better than I'd anticipated based on the reviews I read ahead of time.",1321660800,5,1016,4.745762711864407
4499422,3,B004YDSN3U,"I enjoyed Gettysburg for the most part. I thought it had good production values and decent CGI. The focus on a few less known people in the battle did not concern me as it seems to have others. Buford, Lee, Pickett, Longstreet and Chamberlein have been the focus of a myraid of media presentations. As much as I admire Chamberlein, I think shining the light on others on the vast stage that was the Battle of Gettysburg is overdue.

Having lived in the heart of Iron Brigade territory seeing the ""Black Hats"" and Rufus Dawes play a large part of the show was welcomed. Seeing Culps Hill as a focal point was also a nice change. Many people think the Battle of Gettysburg revolves around Little Round Top and Picketts Charge. That this did not wander over the same worn ground of the 20th Maine and the Kemper, Armistad and Garnett's Brigades, I find refreshing.(As a Minnesota Boy how about something on the 1st Minnesota some time...they had key role on the 2nd day that would make a good story.)

All right some of the history was shaky at best and Sam Rockwells narration and the writing was melodramatic at times. But come on this is the History Channel, their stock is Ice Road Truckers and Pawn Stars. I will show this to my Boy Scout Troop before they we go out to Gettysburg in 2012 and guess what. They will be far more excited by this then the Ken Burn's still pictures and Shelby Foote nuggets. (Which I love, but 15 years olds would fall asleep.) You need to take it for what it is and roll with it. I woud recommend this for someone looking for something beyond the more fact based lecture type of documentary, this aims to entertain and then sneak in a few facts. It succeeds for the most part.",1320969600,8,1708,4.419047619047619
4499423,3,B004YDSN3U,"I caught this when it was first on The History Channel and thought it was a mixed bag.  When I saw it had come out on video I decided to check it out in more detail.  I have to say that mixed bag is a very good term to describe it. The modern computer renditions and graphics are stunning to put it mildly. I also appreciate the emphasis on the first day as well as the battle for Culp's Hill which is almost always left out.  The views of soldiers as well as commanders is a smart idea and one which helps to drive the narration.

Still there are glaring errors and inconsistencies in the story.  The multiple montages of flag bearers being cut down is just gratuitous.  Yes we get that flag bearers were great targets, we don't need to see hundreds cut down. While the stories of the lesser known aspects of the battle are well done, they do cause great harm to the overall story.  It makes the story disjointed and confusing.  Key stories which should be told are ignored and the attempt to move less known stories to the forefront falls flat.  Lastly, the story about the soldier who died with his children's picture in his hand is just wrong.  We don't know if he lingered and he was from upstate New York, not Maine.

All in all this is an interesting and unique telling of the story of the battle but it does not tell the story well and wastes a lot of great opportunities.  It is worth watching but should not be seen as a primary source of information.",1320624000,2,1461,4.2727272727272725

As someone who was never a history buff until the last few years, I can tell you that personally, I loved this. The flashy editing, beautiful cinematography CGI graphics, and nice looking actors make this movie bearable. We watch a lot of documentaries in my house. We also discuss a lot of them. For me, this was one of the better ones and I expected it to be with Tony and Ridley Scott in charge (Alien, Thelma and Louise, Gladiator, Black Hawk Down just to name a few). My husband and niece on the other hand felt there was a ton of stuff left out. They considered it fluff and when I asked my husband for a summary of the DVD for my review he said, ""a lot of people died, there's your quote.""

Personally, I think as far as documentaries go, I think this one was good.",1319414400,,794,4.183006535947713

8448204,3,B004YDSN3U,"This is very much a mixed bag. On the one hand, the production captures the gritty brutality of hand-to-hand Civil War combat well. Its bloody, intense, and in parts uncompromising. It looks very much as if it was directed by Michael Bay, which may or may not float your boat, depending upon your tastes.  On the other hand, wherever this show was filmed, it looks very little like Gettysburg. It is understandable that they couldn't film on location there, due to the sheer number of monuments and markers, but the sequence featuring the railroad cut in day one looks more like it was shot outside Los Angeles than in Pennsylvania. The CGI varies from okay to downright poor, although to be fair this is a made-for-TV docudrama. I just expected more from Ridley Scott, I guess.

I bought this thinking it was another movie on Gettysburg, but it wasnt. Its actually a DVD special from a History Channel show that I had seen on TV before.

The show is OK, but I didn't feel like its worth $7 to spbe nd my money on considering it was only an hour show. I would rather purchased a movie instead.

Graphics were subpar as well as the dramatic schenes. If anything, it felt like a low budget movie that was actually a TV documentary.
