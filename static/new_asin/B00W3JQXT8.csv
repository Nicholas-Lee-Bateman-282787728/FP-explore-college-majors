8711939,1,B00W3JQXT8,"Dont buy anything blue ray on Amazon unless you want to have to buy a blue ray player for every region in the world since they are all not just one region.  Plus this video I bought had a defect in the first disk, buffed that out and then got to the last movie and the Codecs were different so it wouldn't play on my blueray player. Had to buy an upgraded blueray player to just play one stinking disk.  I am selling everything blueray and going back to VCR tapes and DVDs. Blueray has been an expensive nightmare.",1532390400,,514,4.181818181818182

8711942,5,B00W3JQXT8,"Liked the series has a unique view of alien invasion theme, Not SOA or the Walking Dead but enjoyable none the less. The  disks are nicely packaged in a blue plastic case that seem to be the standard for Blu-Ray disks. Nice addition to our collection.",1512777600,,251,4.456521739130435
8711943,5,B00W3JQXT8,"This is a pretty decent sci-fi series, a few minor outlandish things but a good story line. Really demonstrates life- how people act when things are scarce and how they respond to authority  when difficult decisions have to be made, yet they would do far worse with a role reversal.",1510531200,,282,4.64
