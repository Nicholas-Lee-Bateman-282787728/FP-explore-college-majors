3895358,3,B00176X7YM,"The American West of John Ford, 1971 film

It starts with John Wayne riding a horse and falling off. [Or was that a stunt double?] ""They want action pictures."" We see scenes of Monument Valley. [Does Wayne have a shortness of breath?] We see pictures of old movie scenes, they were short movies. ""The Iron Horse"" changed the format of westerns. ""Stagecoach"" was filmed there in 1938 (an area unchanged for centuries). John Ford won many Oscars for his movies and documentaries, not one for a Western. Jimmy Stewart talks about John Ford's accomplishments. Music was part of his films. He tells about the characters of the female stars. ""Fort Apache"" was Ford's version of the Battle of the Little Big Horn. Would a newspaper print the legend in place of the facts? Yes, it occurs daily (IMO). There is a scene set on a former Hollywood movie lot, now torn down for office buildings.

There is a comic scene from ""She Wore a Yellow Ribbon"". [Yellow was the color for the US Cavalry.] Ford used the same actors in his films. Exteriors were shot on location, interiors in movie studios. Ford's outdoors were similar to the paintings of Remington and Russell. These movies became part of American culture. Ford's movies kept scenes simple without too much talk. No man or horse were seriously injured in his films. William S. Hart pointed out that the Indians would have stopped that ""Stagecoach"" by shooting the horses, but that would not have made a dramatic chase. They show scenes from ""The Searchers"" with comments. It ends with a view of Monument Valley and the voice of John Ford (who had an interesting life), the man who made Westerns. There is a reference to John Ford's Navy career (he held the rank of Commander for his services during WW II). He filmed the landings at Omaha Beach, but this was censored due to the heavy casualties.

This is worth watching, but a book would provide more details on his career. It seems like a memorial tribute to John Ford.",1371859200,,1966,4.676300578034682
3895359,4,B00176X7YM,"Good Basic film, (Filmed in 1971), celebrating The Western Films of Hollywood Director John Ford, With stories and annotations from the actors whom Ford directed John Wayne; Jimmy Stewart and Henry Fonda. If you never heard or seen a western film of John Ford, this is good place to start.",1366761600,,289,4.8
3895360,2,B00176X7YM,"The best non-fiction film on John Ford is Peter Bogdanovich's John Ford, Director.  This one lacks punch and insight. A great subject deserves better treatment.",1360540800,2,160,5.4
3895361,2,B00176X7YM,"There's nothing new on this documentary, except for the scenes added in Monument Valley. The Picture Quality is debatable. I could have put this
documentary together with what I've already have on John Ford, John Wayne,
Henry Fonda and James Stewart. And in better picture quality",1227916800,4,280,5.108695652173913

8361847,3,B00176X7YM,"Saw this on the tube when it first came out in 1971.

The picture quality is the same as it was on TV, meaning it isn't hi-def and probably never will be (don't expect it to ever be restored).

It's like sitting in on old friends reminiscing about old times and considering who the friends are, it's a treat to hear their stories and ribbing and reflect that westerns were still a huge part of Hollywood in 1971 but, like the musical, were already a dying breed. The breed just didn't know it yet.",1482364800,,497,4.276595744680851
8361848,3,B00176X7YM,"I am a huge fan of John Ford's movies. This documentary is a glowing tribute to Ford and his movies. I prefer to think of John Ford in that light.
But, if you bother to look a little deeper you will find that John Ford was an old rascal.  He was torn by insecurity and envious of the stars he made.
The old man couldn't even talk to his oldest friends  (John Wayne and Andy Devine) without putting them down.  If you know
all of this then his jokes and asides in this documentary turn into plain old meanness.  That sours the documentary.  I would have loved to
spend some time playing cards with the Ford acting company while remembering the wonderful moments they created. But, that is not what
they were. You would have to be humiliated by Ford to even be in his company.  And that is sad.  Even with all of that, they created magic.",1472774400,,836,4.253164556962025
