6860410,1,B00Q7WBGHG,"In fairy tales, the forest is often a dangerous and deviant space populated with symbolic highwaymen, witches, wolves, and other disruptions of purity.  The new Disney film Into the Woods (adapted from a beloved Broadway musical of which I have almost no knowledge) aims to explore this concept by blending various bedtime-story icons, such as Cinderella, Rapunzel, and Red Riding Hood and her Wolf.  However, in my minority opinion, it is entirely inert and a shameful failure.  I despise this film.  It bored me to tears, and its pretentious gestures toward ""deconstructing"" fairy tales to reveal the inner admonishments and warnings are obvious and underdeveloped at best.  I can only praise it on three counts.  Chris Pine delivers a hilarious and refreshing performance, nicely lampooning the cartoon brawn and dashing pomp of Prince Charming archetypes.  Emily Blunt is also fine; her character is a mite bland and retrograde, but Blunt plays her with characteristic poise and conviction.  And there is a single fantastic song, ""Agony,"" featuring the aforementioned Pine as he tears open his shirt to reveal his chiseled chest and falls to his knees to convey the depth of his romantic longing for Cinderella.

Sondheim devotees can crucify me, but I did not find any of the other songs memorable or even particularly tuneful.  Point a gun at my head, and I could not recite a lyric or whistle the melody from any of them a few hours after watching the film.  Many of the actors seem uncomfortable in their roles or at least unsure how to play them, broadly drawn as they are.  Meryl Streep will receive an obligatory Academy Award nomination for her camp turn as a maternal witch, but her scenery-devouring theatrics are unspectacular.  There is no sense she is having quantifiable fun or pushing herself as a performer.  It is just a seasoned pro loudly overacting in even louder wigs.  And it is hard to imagine a key performance in a major motion picture duller than MacKenzie Mauzy's personality-free turn as the witch's (stolen at birth) ""daughter,"" the long-long-haired Rapunzel.  Anna Kendrick also flounders as a muted, indistinct Cinderella.

Director Rob Marshall does an awful job tying the various fairy-tale references and themes together.  There is never a sense this is a single picture depicting a single world nor is there substantial momentum.  The film registers as an overlong, lopsided swarm of halfhearted and unfinished vignettes.  There is also a dearth of visual imagination on Marshall's part.  This project invites pop, spectacle, and a playful visual eye, but he proves a wan non-stylist at every turn.  Much of the action unfolds on the same half acre of studio-lot woodland.  One ongoing subplot involves Cinderella thrice fleeing the prince's ball in fear he will realize her low social standing and fall out of love, but never once does Marshall's camera dare enter the ball itself.  He is satisfied filming the steps again and again.  Nor are we treated to even a single tantalizing glimpse of the land of the giants.  Just closeups of those magic beans.",1419552000,28,3094,5.017647058823529
6860411,4,B00Q7WBGHG,"Disney has made a movie of the popular stage play ""Into the Woods"", which opened Christmas Day. It features an excellent cast, including Meryl Streep, Emily Blunt, Johnny Depp, and Chris Pine, among others. It is a musical, and a decent one, although not everyone can equally pull their weight on the songs. The sets are magically enhanced by CGI and wonderful to look at. The plot is a fascinating mash-up of the fairy tales Cinderella, Jack and the Beanstalk, Little Red Riding Hood, and Rapunzel, although the core plotline centers around a baker and his wife who want a child in the worst way, and who happen to live next door to a witch.

The magic of the presentation is such that the mash-up, at least for the first hour and a half, makes entire sense. The various characters have all made a wish, and the pursuit of those wishes intertwine in dramatic and sometimes humorous ways. However, just about the time the movie is lining up for happy endings all around, the story goes sideways in a big way, pun intended. The characters discover that wishes aren't free and come with consequences...

The movie was very entertaining. This reviewer did not see the play, but noted that a Christmas Day audience applauded enthusiastically at the end of the movie. Recommended.",1419465600,,1275,4.738738738738738
6860412,5,B00Q7WBGHG,"With music and lyrics by the incomparable Stephen Sondheim, an engrossing screenplay by James Lapine, and capably directed by Rob Marshall, ""Into the Woods"" is a subversive and seriocomic take on stories by the Brothers Grimm. For years, a humble baker and his devoted wife (James Corden and Emily Blunt) long for a child in vain. A despondent Cinderella (Anna Kendrick) wishes that she could be relieved of her cleaning duties long enough to spend quality time with a handsome prince at his castle. Red Riding Hood is off to grandma's house, but a leering wolf (Johnny Depp) has her in his sights. Jack, of beanstalk fame, is a boy whose widowed mother (Tracy Ullman) chides him for being thickheaded and impractical. A scheming witch with her own agenda, played by the brilliant Meryl Streep, brings these characters together. They subsequently interact in ways that are unexpected, humorous, and touching.

Sondheim's sophisticated, subtle, and clever score meshes perfectly with the story. In the forbidding woods, nothing is clear-cut. Handsome princes may be charming hypocrites. An ugly witch may cackle sardonically, but she also dotes on her daughter, whom she is determined to protect from an evil and dangerous world. Jack's mother cuffs his ears in anger, but cares about him deeply. Disconcerting and surprising things happen here. People take foolish risks, find courage they did not know they had, and ultimately lose their innocence.

The production values, particularly the cinematography and special effects, are eye-catching, and the actors turn in solid performances. Although they are not, for the most part, known for their singing, they effectively convey the meaning and emotion behind Sondheim's words and music. Streep is in a class by herself; when she is on screen, we cannot take our eyes off her. She is hateful, but interestingly so; her gestures, facial expressions, and voice are mesmerizing. Although this is a Disney production, it is not for pre-adolescents. ""Into the Woods"" uses fairy tales as vehicles to analyze, with wit and a touch of sadness, life's ambiguities, dreams, and disappointments in a way that most children would not comprehend.",1419465600,18,2183,5.216524216524217
6860413,4,B00Q7WBGHG,"Based on the Broadway play that debuted over 28 years ago, Disney tells the tale of various fairy tales from Jack and the Beanstalk, Cinderella, Rapunzel, and Snow White as they all come together in an unforgettable story. The film has a star studded cast with Anna Kendrick, Chris Pine, James Corden, Emily Blunt, Johnny Depp, Tammy Blanchard, and Meryl Streep.

Its easy to describe the plot of the movie as basically your watching four classic stories all be bundled into one, but with a catch. The commonality is that the main characters from each all end up going through the woods. However, a Baker (James Corden) and his wife (Emily Blunt) come to find that their house is cursed after the witch, played by Meryl Streep, requests four items to have the curse reversed. The items include: hair as yellow as gold, a red hood, a golden slipper, and a cow as white as snow. And so the adventure begins as we watch the main characters from each story run into the baker at various points in the film where he must acquire the items necessary so that he and his wife can have a child.

Being that Into The Woods is a musical you come to expect a quite amount of singing and there is no let up in that department. It isn't to say your not entertained by the music and the performances by the actors cause they all had a good time doing the film. Whats amazing is how they were able to intertwine story-lines that all seemed natural in a way that didn't complicate understanding what was going on. I was very impressed by it and should do the same for audiences who go out to watch the film. One of the disappointments I had was with the limited appearance of Johnny Depp. His role was of the Big Bad Wolf as he goes after Little Red Riding Hood (Lilla Crawford) whod then be saved by the Baker. Although it was a small part for Depp he did a great job as always and even had a creepy side to him while stalking the little girl.

You have to give it to James Corden and Emily Blunt who held the movie for a good chunk along with Meryl Streep. They were brilliant and funny at the same time that gave for some good laughs in the process. I enjoyed watching them together as their chemistry really worked as they were likable from the start. And for Meryl Streep she is as talented as always. With her portrayal of the witch you could see different sides of her; especially when it came to her daughter Rapunzel. Although her mother comes off as evil by secluding her daughter from any visitors she does have a soft side as well. Overall, Streep took the drivers seat yet again and blew her performance out of the water. Simply amazing.

For the first two-thirds of the film your following the different tales up until the Baker acquires all the materials needed to lift the curse. However, when a giant descends from the clouds to avenge her husbands death due to Jacks (Daniel Huttlestone) actions is when the film hits a snag. The movie literally stalls for a good 45 minutes as they try to stop the giant from wrecking havoc and giving her what she wants which is the boy Jack. A lot of dialogue takes place within that time and nothing is really happening. The film does a good job of faking the ending but then becomes unnecessary to continue after everything thats happened.

And then comes something that bothered me as the Bakers wife is searching for young Jack but then runs into Cinderallas prince. For a Disney film you wouldnt suspect that they wouldnt go the route of an affair; especially when the Bakers wife gives birth to her child. It just took me by surprise and had many in the audience with the same reaction as to how appropriate that would be for the movie and to what impact it would have on the story. I understand the times are changing and more and more films are succumbing to the trials and tribulations of the media and Hollywood but to have that scene in the movie was totally unnecessary.

If your looking for a holiday get-away with the kids and want to have a good time then I would recommend Into The Woods. Theres plenty to admire and appreciate by the performances as youll get acquainted with the musical bits and become attached to many of the characters.",1419465600,11,4193,4.424870466321243

The scene with Johnny Depp as the Wolf with little red riding hood is beyond disturbing and is completely inappropriate in a pedophile sense...  No plot and the movie drones on and on and on.  Ending does not wrap anything up and leaves you wondering what the point was.  The songs are terrible.

And all the people complaining about how the movie glorifies / excuses adultery are morons who can't be bothered to stop and think about the purpose / rationale behind certain narrative moves. The entire point of the second half of the story is to throw a monkey-wrench in fairytales and to urge us to think about how flimsy and unlikely ""happily ever after"" can be. It's not amoral; it's intentional and, once again, it's the entire flipping point of the story.

6860467,4,B00Q7WBGHG,"This 2014 theatrical adaptation of Stephen Sondheim's ""Into the Woods"" has its lovers and haters, and I'd fall close to the lover category. It's not a perfect adaptation, but it's still an excellent one. It captures the heart of the story without being overly long, and the performances by the full cast are excellent.

Online reviews for ITW fall into two categories - 1 star from those who were too dense to realize that they were going to see an adaptation of the Broadway show and/or were shocked that this Disney movie was not for children (duh!), or Broadway purists who criticize that the cast was not perfect and that every single song and line from the original wasn't included. Likewise, those who give it 5 stars seem to gush about how wonderfully wonderful it is (blech!).

The reality it that Into the Woods is in between - a solid 4 star, 7 out of 10. It appropriately trims a 3 hour Broadway show down to 2 hours, leaving out some musical numbers and story elements. It also changes some of the story line to compensate. Perhaps its greatest weakness is the heavy trimming in Act 2 that alters the story line of the Princes and Rapunzel significantly. Nonetheless, it works, and works well. While not the finest voices, you'll be astounded at how these well-known actors can sing, and they act far better than most good singers can.

I hated Johhny Depp in this (but love him in lots of other things!), everything about his performance was odd and uncomfortable in my opinion. I'm actually mixed on Meryl Streep as the witch.

6860495,4,B00Q7WBGHG,"RELEASED IN 2014 and directed by Rob Marshall, ""Into the Woods"" is a musical about a baker (James Corden) and his wife (Emily Blunt) who venture into the dark forest to find the ingredients a witch (Meryl Streep) says will lift the curse that has made them childless, which will simultaneously restore the witch's beauty. Into this plot are mixed the popular fairy tales of Little Red Riding Hood (Lilla Crawford), Cinderella & her prince (Anna Kendrick & Chris Pine), Jack and the Beanstalk (Daniel Huttlestone) and Rapunzel & her prince (Mackenzie Mauzy & Billy Magnussen). Johnny Depp has a glorified cameo as the wolf that preys upon Red Riding Hood.

I'm not a fan of musicals, generally speaking, but I love ""The Wizard of Oz"" (1939) and ""Into the Woods"" is akin to a modern-day ""Wizard of Oz"" albeit with superior locations/sets/effects and way more music (composed by Stephen Sondheim). I think it would've worked better if, like ""Wizard,"" there was more dialogue and less song & dance, but that's just me. The great cast is more-than-up for the task, however, and I like the black humor and message. The work by hundreds of talented people that went into pulling this film off is mind-boggling. And they DO pull it off. If you can't handle musicals, though, head for the hills.

THE MOVIE RUNS 125 minutes and was shot in England. WRITERS: Stephen Sondheim & James Lapine. ADDITIONAL CAST: Christine Baranski plays Cinderella's evil stepmother and Tammy Blanchard & Lucy Punch her spoiled stepsisters.

It was good. Obviously Meryl Streep was the corner stone to the cast that held it all together to make the movie as great as it was. I enjoyed it for the simple fact I got to see her in a more broadway-style role for once. What a gal! I'd adopt her as my grandmother any day of the week.

Using young actors in films is a slippery slope, and yes Red Riding Hood's actress was the weakness of the whole film (plot aside). Collectively it pulled through: Good sense of humor throughout the film and enough going on to keep my attention. It's definitely a film geared towards the younger crowd, but it's still worth at least one watch as an adult. There is singing obviously, hence my reference to Broadway. If you don't like singing in films but your girlfriend/wife wants to see it, break out the vodka and power through it. The film I mean, not the bottle. Enjoy!",1503705600,2,1056,4.171568627450981

The fairy tales are faithful to the original stories by Grimm etc. which I read when I was 13 and yes, there's blood and gore and death in the original stories. I understand and appreciate the message that there really is no happily ever after, that you have to take responsibility for your choices and your actions, etc. etc. It's interesting and funny in spots.
Did I like it? Would I watch it again?

um...no.

I do like musicals like Miss Saigon, Les Miserables, Oliver, West Side Story, Evita, Joseph and the Technicolor Coat, and Phantom of the Opera and all Oscar Hammerstein musicals. I didn't care for Cats (although I love the song, Memory), Chorus Line, Rent, Chicago, or Wicked. Guess, I can add Into the Woods to the ""do not like"" list.

6860507,5,B00Q7WBGHG,"I enjoyed this beautiful, well-acted, delightful film of Stephen Sondheim's masterpiece Into the Woods. The work includes a wealth of items, fun dialogue, and very nice music. A baker and his wife go into a magic forest to find four items that a witch ordered must be found and given to her so that the curse she placed on the baker and his wife that they would have no children would be erased. The witch placed the curse on the family because the baker's father stole some magic beans from her garden. The four items would also restore the witch's beauty. Meryl Streep plays the witch.
The film combines versions of several fairy tales with this story of the baker and his wife: Cinderella, Red Riding Hood, Jack and the Bean Stalk, and Rapunzel  who in the film is the daughter that the witch stole from the bakers parents; the sister of the baker.
I saw the play version and read the book that Sondheim wrote, and saw that the film is true to what Sondheim wrote. The cast is perfect, the actors marvelous, including Meryl Streep and Johnny Deep as the wolf.

6860512,4,B00Q7WBGHG,"I saw the original 1988 ""Into the Woods"" production on Broadway.  I loved the first act!  The second act just bored me to death with all its moral wisdom.  I find that I like the movie better than the live musical.  All the actors were well chosen.  I am particularly impressed with the singing of Emily Blunt, Anna Kendrick and Chris Pine.  The others are fine as well but those 3 really appealed to me.  As usual, Meryl Streep shows again what a marvelous actress she is as the witch.  I do wish Tracy Ullman had more screen time because she is dead-on with her comic timing as Jack's mother.

The movie is better for me because I could sit through the 2nd act of the film without becoming bored. It felt much more cohesive and came to a quick ending.

Of Sondheim's work, I still think ""Sweeney Todd"" is the best adapted from the musical to film than ""Into the Woods"".  ""Sweeney"" does not have the truncated second act ending.

6860547,4,B00Q7WBGHG,"Prior to watching this movie Into the Woods, I knew nothing about the story. I have never seen the musical although I sure would like to! I chose this movie because I love fairy tales and the incredible cast.

Into the Woods is a musical about a baker (James Corden) and his wife (Emily Blunt) who long to have a baby. They discover a witch (Meryl Streep) put a curse on their house long ago and, in order to lift the curse and have the ability to have a baby, they must fulfill the witch's tasks within three nights. This musical combines four fairy tales (Cinderella, Little Red Riding Hood, Jack and the Beanstalk, and Rapunzel) whose characters end up interacting with each other many times during the movie. A lot of the movie takes place in the woods and it's fun to see how the fairy tales twist together. The main cast also includes Anna Kendrick, Chris Pine, and Johnny Depp. This movie is rated PG and is 125 minutes long.

My husband agreed to watch this with me and we both enjoyed it, even though it took us some time to adjust to the musical feel of it. We both like some musicals but we weren't sure what to expect from it. We watched this four days ago and I had to ponder how to rate this and express my feelings on it. The singing is beautiful and I really enjoyed the acting. It was funny at times and I liked seeing how the actors portrayed the fairy tales that I already knew. I feel like there are five separate storylines (all four fairy tales plus the baker and baker's wife's story) and, at the end, they all end up interacting with each other to accomplish their tasks. At times, I started to lose interest only because I often don't watch musicals and they aren't my first choice to watch but I'm glad we finished it because we both ended up liking it.

Overall, we liked this movie/musical, although it was definitely different. I'd say you should probably have some interest in musicals if you are considering buying this. If you don't like musicals, you might not find this that interesting. For me, I bought it because I love fairy tales, I loved the cast, and I like musicals. I think it might be easier to follow if I saw it on stage but I still enjoyed it. I can't say that I will watch this movie that often but I'm glad I watched it. If you know someone who owns this, you might want to borrow it first before you buy it in case you don't like it that much. I recommend this if you enjoy musicals, fairy tales, and a great cast!",1489449600,13,2464,4.283261802575107

So let me try again.

This movie is really really annoying.

I didn't watch past the 12 minute mark and I should of stopped in the first minute but I really wanted to give it a chance.
It doesn't deserve a chance though, go watch the Honest Trailer for it, you'll know if it's for you or not.",1485734400,,435,4.154761904761905

Plain and simply, the movie was terrible.  Absolutely terrible.  The singing was annoying.  The songs were terrible.  The characters were terrible.  The acting was terrible.  Pretty much everything was terrible.  I'm glad people were eaten (should have stayed eaten) and that some of them died.  They all should have died.  Movie would have been just OK if it had ended in the middle when I thought it actually was ending.  Then unfortunately there was another hour of utter crap.  If this was a ""true adaptation"" of the actual musical then I'm glad I haven't paid any money to see this 2 hour waste of time.

6860629,3,B00Q7WBGHG,"As an avid fan of the original stage recording of the musical which I would watch on repeat when it was on Netflix many years ago, I was ecstatic. I love the story. It's a spin on the classic tales we've heard since childhood. The music is phenomenal. But as you may have noticed I did not give 5 stars to this version. This is because while the story was kept in tact fundamentally (minus two characters *cough* Narrator *cough* Baker's dad) the tone of musical was completely changed. This movie took out the hilarity that I so much in the musical. The tone on the stage is that while the story is overall dark especially at the end the characters also have a sense of humor. The movie was just dark. Not to say that the acting was off or the singing wasn't good. I believe the actors went in the direction they were given but the movie just left me unsatisfied.",1480982400,2,864,4.306748466257669

6860632,5,B00Q7WBGHG,"Those who appreciate the arts and understand the concept of the movie will love it. It seems too many reviewers on here were hurt and crushed that their childhood fairy tales would be twisted like this. These are based on the original fairy tales not the happily ever after crap that companies have made up to please conservative audiences. If you have ever read the Grimm's fairy tales or seen the original play then you know what you are in for. Also the description clearly labels this movie as a musical so if you are whining that you bought a musical make sure you read next time or at least do a little research before making a quick decision purchase. By no means am I a professional movie reviewer I just think this movie gets a lot of unjustified flack because people were too quick to purchase and not realize what they were getting themselves into. Also FYI for those of you saying ""Ah the children this will ruin them,"" I am sorry but life doesn't have too many happy endings so at least this isn't giving some unrealistic expectation.",1480550400,,1047,4.515789473684211

Saw Into the Woods in NYC at Shakespeare in the Park with Amy Adams and it was WAY more comedic and entertaining than this. A lot of the acting here felt mediocre.

If you want to make a musical then make sure you get actors who can sing. If they cannot sing then please arrange for a professional singer!

6860766,2,B00Q7WBGHG,This movie is not good for children it has hints sexual intentions and inappropriateness  for its rating. The other thing that really bothers me is the music has the same underscore through the full film. I do like some  musicals a good musical has many different songs not just one song with slight changes to it like this one did I can't get that horrible sound out of my heard. I'm sorry its hours later and that underscore won't end it's like a child humming the same 4 notes. It was a good movie for little while it would have been ok if it didn't last too long and was not intended for children to watch it really felt longer than the 2 hours and 4 mins.,1469491200,2,660,4.188976377952756

I am a professional theatre technician, and occasional designer, and have worked on many musicals, including several productions of Into The Woods, as well as several other Stephan Sondheim productions. I like how Into The Woods begins, and I like how it ends, but it has always felt just weird and long through the middle. This is, essentially, a review of the original script rather than of the film. I warned my girlfriend when we decided to watch the film that it was a little dark and weird, a surprising choice for Disney, but we went forward. Streep was awesome. In fact, the entire cast was excellent. Unlike the horrible film treatment of Sweeney Todd (in which they chopped up the orchestration and slashed the chorus... the thing that makes that musical so incredible... yes, I said ""slashed""... See the poorly filmed, but brilliantly performed original Broadway production with Angela Lansbury)... I digress... unlike that film, this film of Into The Woods was lovingly produced in terms of music, singing, orchestration, etc...

But it's weird and dark to watch. Not for everyone's taste.",1469232000,3,1161,5.0732984293193715

In fact, I have purchased over 140 (ONE HUNDRED FORTY) movies on Amazon Video in reliance on her ability to view them on her television, which she is not able to do on other televisions we own, such as Sony televisions, having complex menu systems.  Now, TODAY, JUNE 15, 2016, Amazon has decided to discontinue support of Amazon Video on her Vizio television and instead wants me to buy a Firestick for $50, which she will undoubtedly be unable to use!

6860855,5,B00Q7WBGHG,"I think it is true to say that when the name Stephen Sondheim is mentioned most people would think of his musicals 'A Little Night Music' or 'Sweeney Todd', or remember him as the lyricist for 'Gypsy' and the simply outstanding 'West Side Story'. Well, the great man has done many more and in 1987 one of his shows hit Broadway and hit the West End in 1990 (which I was actually lucky enough to work on). Winning multi Tony awards and Oliviers the show was 'Into The Woods'. The story intertwines various characters from fairy tales including, Little Red Riding Hood, Jack and the Beanstalk, Rapunzel and Cinderella. These are all mixed in with an original story of a Baker and his Wife, their quest to start a family and reverse a curse put on them by the Witch. We've all heard the saying 'Be careful what you wish for...' well this show's main theme is wish fulfillment and its concequences. There is a generous mix of hope, heartache and humour in the show and it's certainly one of my personal favourites.
Now this brilliant show has been given the big screen treatment, and what a movie.
The production is outstanding and the cast superb. Directed by Rob Marshall (who also directed the movie version of the musical 'Chicago' winning it the Oscar for best picture), the film is an excellent adaptation from stage to screen.
The whole cast were amazing. Meryl Streep is incredible as 'the Witch', Lilla Crawford plays the bratish 'Red Riding Hood', Chris Pine and Billy Magnussen are fantastic as the vain and egotistial Princes, James Corden as 'The Baker', Emily Blunt as 'The Baker's Wife' and Anna Kendrick as Cinderella play their parts so well with the right balance of emotion and light-heartedness. Daniel Huttlestone as Jack and Tracey Ullman as his mother were both terrific.
I think the only 'niggles' I had were that a few of the songs from the show had been cut, which I never like happening anyway, and a couple of the ones they took out were, I think, needed.
However, having said that the movie is excellent and well worth seeing.
If you are a massive musicals fan like myself you will be definitely adding this movie to your DVD collection",1465430400,,2161,4.64490861618799

6860933,3,B00Q7WBGHG,"Loved the first part and then the last 30 minutes of the movie was stupid. I feel like they were trying to make a statement about fairy tales with the original play in general and effectively bring more realism to them in general...however the way it plays out as a movie, it really just came across as poor writing. I know, I know...It's a Disney Movie...But hey it is supposed to be a remake of a play, this was a perfectly good movie until the last 30 minutes. I was absorbed in it up to the end and literally fell asleep because it was so uninteresting towards the end. To my chagrin, I actually rewound the movie and watched the end of it. The first part of the movie is definitely fun and is very much watchable (as is the play.) However, the end (the real meat of the story) was like trying to pass a gallstone. I would recommend watching the play instead if these types of stories are your bag.

The singing did not bother me, but I can see where some people would find it annoying.  It is a bit long for what it is, especially with no intermission like you would have at a play (although you could insert your own intermission I suppose).  FYI, Johnny Depp is in the movie for 5 minutes if that's what you're interested in.  Hardly worth it even though he's portrayed as having a larger role in the previews.

6860978,4,B00Q7WBGHG,"Seagate has been in business for many decades and been of Excellent product manufacturing of Disk Drives as has Western Digital, since the beginning of the Computer age.  It's Awesome to see that they respond to End-Users regarding their products purchased from ANY Source!  I got a Seagate Backup-Plus 3TB drive a couple years ago.  Had a few issues getting Win-7-Home-Premium- 64-bit to recognize the full capacity of the drive.  For any Non-Computer-Savvy, would take some time and even be frustrating till they gave up or called a Pro to take care of it.  However and fortunately for me, I began my education in computers since Windows 3.0 came into our era, hardware and software at the same time.  Took me a bit since Win7 wasn't accessing partitions larger than 2TB, lol.  I ended up re-partitioning the 3TB drive into 3 partitions (as what my personal requirements met) and walla, Win7-64-Bit had no problem dealing with it from then on.  Yes, I took advantage of Seagate's 'SeaTools' as well, was helpful.  For you 'Old-Schooler' Windows Buffs, I Also utilized Windows 'DISCPART' to completely Re-Write and Format Under the UEFI Parameters Manually, Since Win7 had NO Automatic Way for doing that, at that time.

This was definitely not either of those. Add in the fact that they strayed from the story line (Rapunzel), and that is the reason I only gave it four stars.

Sondheim has created a narrative that is musically complicated, lyrically brilliant and seamless in delivery.

6861024,5,B00Q7WBGHG,Wonderful entertaining movie based on the musical into the woods,1457740800,,64,5.5
6861025,2,B00Q7WBGHG,"While the film is visually impressive and the music is polished to near inhuman perfection, it just seems like Disney was eager to claim yet another fairytale adaptation as its own without completely understanding what the point was. Either that, or they just polished some of it out. The whole idea is that actions have consequences and wishing can be dangerous if not thought through well, and every major character, whether we like them or not, does some either reprehensible or flat out despicable in pursuit of what they want, usually rationalizing it as a necessary evil. The baker and his wife feel too much like wide-eyed innocents in this movie, and some of the cuts from the stage musical would have been better kept in because the progression of the plot made more sense that way.

On another note, the problem with just doing a straight up port of the musical from stage to screen is that it seems strange when, for example, Jack is singing about his encounter with the giants. Sure, we see a clip or two, but in most movies, something like that seems like it would be a major point in the story and it's odd that it happens offscreen. Several scenes are like this, which made sense on the stage because a) those stories weren't the focus, and b) probably wasn't enough in the budget to do them anyway. Sondheim music and stories tend to be very dialogue heavy, so again, it makes sense in context, but the movie only gives snippets. Why not just make a movie based on the plot of the musical? You could include singing or leave it out entirely, but still stay true to the message.

Also, the music has two major acts. The movie skips a few scenes and has no intermission, so what you think is the climax of the story (assuming you've never seen any adaptations of this before) actually isn't. It makes the movie feel weird and long and meandering.

The actors are decent for what they've been given. I'd say they are talented at singing, but every song is so painfully touched up that I can't be sure. During the final song that Meryl Streep gets as the witch, I swear I could not understand a word she said on my first listen. I'm surprised Disney kept certain scenes in the movie, and part of me wonders if they intentionally made the wolf/little red scene more pedo-tastic on purpose. It's kind of hilarious.

All in all, I'm not crazy about it. Watch the stage show with Bernadette Peters on DVD instead. It may look cheaper, but its choices are a lot more interesting and meaningful. I saw this version first and that version second, coming in completely blind for the record.

I will say that the Cinderella stair scene was pretty good.

6861052,3,B00Q7WBGHG,"Note: I saw this film for free in High Definition via XFinity On Demand.

I saw Into The Woods earlier, and I didn't really like it. I saw a (toned down) production of the play in college, and I thought it was very queer (the word is another way of saying 'Strange' in case anyone here is trying to be politically correct, and decides to report this review). The film itself should have not been made at Walt Disney Pictures; it was way too dark for the company associated with classic faerie tales, in my opinion.

SPOILERS!!!! The Wolf (Johnny Depp) sings about how plump Red Riding Hood's flesh is, and The Prince (Chris Pine) presumably has his way with The Baker's Wife (Emily Blunt) after kissing her passionately. Clearly, pedophillia is not Disney material, neither is adultery (or, as the Bible calleth it, playing the whore). The film should have been rated R, in my view. Yes, there was no profanity or overt sexual content, but the inclusion of Cinderella's Stepmother (Christine Baranski) cutting off her daughter's toe and heel and both of them being blinded by crows (albeit implied) is too dark for Disney, as was the inclusion of the historically accurate voodoo in The Princess And The Frog.

6861088,3,B00Q7WBGHG,"tl;dr:
1. If you don't know the show and are thinking of the kids - do some research first.
2. If you're all about the music, get the stage production - a lot had to be cut.
3. If you don't care for the stylization of musical theatre - get the movie

On to the full review.

For background, I'm a major fan of the stage musical.  I was cast in local productions twice, but only one went to production.  Sondheim is notoriously hard to sing, but Woods isn't as bad as some.  The show generally hangs on 4 roles: The Baker and his wife, Cinderella, and the witch - who is really the linchpin of the show.

The story had to be adjusted quite a bit to fit the format change.  The narrator had to go, which left the Baker's father... essentially gone. the act 1 finale and act 2 beginning had to be truncated badly, Rapunzel and her prince were out of Act 2.  Songs were removed, of course.  However, the major points of the show were there, though some of them wound up rather altered.  The initial ""Agony"" is in the show, and rather deliberately camped up - to the point that it's a shame that the reprise doesn't appear, but then Rapunzel and her prince don't appear at all in the second act.

The biggest story of this production is the cast.  Most of the performances are exactly what you'd expect in this sort of production, but I had a couple of concerns:

Having only heard Streep sing in Mama Mia, I was VERY apprehensive about her in Bernadette Peters's role... but she didn't try to compete, instead playing to her own strengths, and thus turned in an electric performance.

Red and Jack are both cast as children in this production.  The director explains why he made that choice in the Special Features, but I don't think it was a good call.  For these two characters the story is supposed to be about the transition from adolesence to adulthood - so the Wolf's pursuit of Red, which is supposed to be a seduction, goes from mildly creepy to downright pedophilic.  Fortunately the part is not played by the same actor as Cinderella's prince, so the extra emphasis of the philandering prince playing ""the big bad wolf"" doesn't put its usual exclamation point on the discomfort intended.  However, Red's and Jack's relative age makes what was originally an awkward adolescent attraction into a prickly competitiveness in the interaction between Jack's admiration of the wolf cape and Red's ""suuuuuure"" response to Jack's story about the harp.  ""No One Is Alone"" is supposed to be in part about BEING on your own, and neither child is of an age where that's remotely appropriate.  I won't say it ruins the show, but it certainly negates some of the point.

Last, the role of the Baker is somewhat changed in this production.  With the narrator/Baker's father removed, ""No More"" must be as well.  With ""goodbye old pal"" removed, ""Maybe they're magic"" and its reprise are also.  Suddenly the actor's singing doesn't have to stand on its own with quite as much force, as he can lean on the other singers in his other songs, and acting chops become more important.  Also with these dramatic interactions removed, the role can focus more on physical comedy... enter James Corden.  Whether it's the direction or just his voice, his musical parts don't hold up to Chip Zien... but he doesn't have to.  Emily Blunt carries ""It Takes Two"" and Anna Kendrick carries ""No One Is Alone,"" with ""Your Fault"" as a true ensemble piece.  The role however is still central to the story - arguably the lead, opposite the witch - and Corden's acting shines.

In case you can't tell, the music is for me the most important part of Into The Woods.  As a result, my preference lies with the stage production.  However, if you're not a musical theatre fan and thus prepared for the ""conventions"" of the form, and if you'd rather see real set pieces instead of a cow with a handle on the top (used to comedic effect) and skrimwork, go with the movie.",1452643200,2,3929,4.5383522727272725

6861095,5,B00Q7WBGHG,"As most fairytales are stories to teach moral lessons to children, this entertaining, slightly edgy, incredibly creative, timeless musical is definitely not for small children, but can, and should be appreciated by those who enjoy musicals and don't mind some minor tuning of their moral compass.  That's why the stories continued after the ""big Royal Wedding"" and make us, maybe painfully aware, that there really aren't any ""Happily Ever Afters"".

I've seen the play on Broadway, and this film did a great job recreating it. Sadly, they do take out 6 of the original songs, but voices and acting are wonderful. The production value is great without being too ""Hollywood"" - it still kept a sense of whimsy and true to the feel of the ""theater"" while giving you beautiful scenery and nice special effects.

Is it worth watching? Definitely. Would I watch it again? Yes. Would my husband watch it? Not sure. He doesn't like musicals, but I think I could get him to watch it. You may want to give it a try too. There's only a little speaking, it's mostly all singing, but the songs are mostly light and catchy and the stories are easy to follow. It's not heavy like Les Miserable or Phantom of the Opera. There's humor and familiar fairytales. My teenager surprised me by ignoring it at first, then telling me to start it over from the beginning.

For those who don't quite understand the message/moral in this play/movie: (If you know the fairytales I don't think I'll be spoiling it for you.)
It seems the subtleness of the moral message and the intertwining of the stories is confusing you. Essentially, the message is that those characters who stray from the metaphorical moral paths, and literal physical ones, are punished and the things they do affect others in ways they may never know.  Red's mother tells her, ""don't stray from the path"", and ""nice is different than good"" and despite her evil ways the Witch loves her ""child"" and sings about being careful with words as children are listening, watching and learning . The characters' paths literally and metaphorically intersect as they journey into the woods (into their stories) and then back out again.",1452038400,2,2164,4.822102425876011

6861100,3,B00Q7WBGHG,"Bizarre... Bordering on perverse at times (and I'm not even conservative).  The only reason I finished really was Meryl Streep.  James Corden as the The Baker wasn't too bad.  Tracey Ullman, as Jack's mother, was ok once the character decided to quit being a shrew.  This makes _Labyrinth_ a musical movie that children of the 80s should well remember--that made some very conservative parents complain--look really wholesome in some respects. LOL I'd take the _Labyrinth_ over this any day of the week, even now, though.  Honestly, I'm being a bit generous giving this a three-star review: I'll never get this two hours and some change back.

I guess Disney didn't want to question the ""happy endings"" of their sacred cows. That would be fine, but the best parts of the play are the parts that make you think about happily-ever-after. These parts are noteably absent from the movie.

I had my boyfriend see it with me, (he hasn't seen the play) and he didn't understand the movie's second act. They took out so many scenes that it felt rushed and pointless -- he described it feeling as if they took a traditional fairy tale and added a longish, relatively unnecessary epilogue.

6861148,3,B00Q7WBGHG,"Before watching this movie, be aware that IT IS A MUSICAL!!! Much like Les Miserables, most of the movie is singing, and the plotlines move through the music. I have always loved the Bernadette Peters stage production, and was excited to see this in theaters. I took my mother and sister to see it, and without being able to help ourselves, we were singing along. The princes were hilarious in ""Agony"" and Meryl Streep did an admirable job as the Witch, but she is no Bernadette. I also enjoyed the car salesman approach of Johnny Depp as the wolf convincing Red Riding Hood to ""stray from the path"". I wasn't pleased with the casting of Daniel Huttlestone as Jack, as his accent and choppy style of singing took away from ""Giants in the Sky"".

What disappointed me most is the change in the story, with more of a focus on the reluctance of the Baker to be a father because of his own father's abandonment. They also left out the best song in the entire play, ""No More"". While the soundtrack played the familiar tune as the Baker came face to face with an illusion of his father, the moment was not as powerful. I found the changes in many lines, both in the music and the dialogue, to be distracting, but to someone who had never seen (or memorized) the play, these changes will not bother them.

I loved the cinematography and the feel of the woods, and my overall experience was positive.",1447632000,,1391,4.47244094488189

We have a fairly wide range of taste when it comes to movies and I don't shelter them from the world, so to have them literally beg me to shut it off was really shocking. While the music was whimsical at times and there was notable humor intermixed, the unsettling twisted plot along with sub-par theatre performance and crappy makeup left a lot to be desired in this feeble attempt to entertain my family.

Should have stuck with dark, it would have been more internally consistent.  Others complain about the transition to the second half but it didn't bother me at all.  Life is like that.  Doesn't have to make sense.  it just is.

I bought this because i wanted to watch Emily Blunt sing. If i get the chance i will beg her to put out an album.  Great voice, great performance.  In fact, she always exceeds expectations.  To be fair, her voice isn't outstanding.  What is outstanding is the emotion she conveys when she does sing.  I love Johnny Cash but his vocal quality was iffy at best.  It was the heart and soul that made him the ""Man in Black.""  The entire cast was really good.  The main song of the second half is compelling.  ""You are not alone.""  much needed message in our age of social media vs true communication.  Brought tears to my eyes.  for real.",1446681600,3,1029,4.43010752688172

6861213,3,B00Q7WBGHG,"A Disney musical that is an amalgam of several fairy tales including Jack and the Beanstalk, Little Red Riding Hood, Cinderella, and Rapunzel. The characters and elements of the tales interact with each other. Mostly the songs are forgettable and not done all that well. The story has its moments but overall not so great.

It had some dark moments and moments of moral ambiguity but it never focused enough on those aspects to make me appreciate it. However, it was good enough for me to watch the whole thing, and I am not a fan of musicals at all.

I kind of expected a Disney children's movie when it first started but I can't say I would recommend if for younger kids, and older kids might well be bored by it.",1444003200,2,715,4.409090909090909

However, I was really surprised by the seemingly poor reception of this based on the ratings here. Personally, I found this to be a very unique, poignant and certainly entertaining combination of fairy tales as old as time. The cast was very well chosen, the special effects well used without overshadowing the actions/dialogue. Admittedly I hadn't even heard of or seen previews for this before watching it, so I went in without any expectations. But I would definitely watch it again and found it to be a very fitting adaptation for this season in particular - a nice offering for those of us who, in the run-up to Halloween, are less interested in the blood & guts gore that usually comes around this time of year. The only thing I personally didn't care for and that I deducted a star from is the interactions between Red Riding Hood and the Big Bad Wolf - to me, Johnny Depp came across as lecherous rather than menacing, and that made those scenes kind of ""icky"" to me.",1443916800,,1112,4.50990099009901

The movie is very dark and has some really adult themes. This is fine becuase this movei was not marketed or intended for a very young crowd. I am totally okay with the violence and death. I even don't mind the pretty obvious sexual content between the Big Bad Wolf and Red Riding Hood (and Grandma?). The movie gets a solid 4 stars based on my opinion (subjective it seems) that the characters didn't really know what to do on screen while singing. It is a musical, after all, but when they are converted to movies it can be awkward to watch characters mill about hte screen aimlessly (at times) while they sing for minutes at a time.

6861242,3,B00Q7WBGHG,"This was disappointing. I don't quite understand the insanely glowing reviews that seem to suggest anyone who doesn't like this film is some sort of philistine. I like musicals. I like Stephen Sondheim. This, however, was a bit of a hot mess. My first issue with it is that the thing was filmed in shades of dark on dark with a little darker thrown in, just in case you might be able to see it. I get that it is in the woods and the woods are dark, but I could barely see the thing. Perhaps it is cliche, but I like my fairy tales with a little sparkle, at least enough to make the film visible. The creepy scene between Little Red Riding Hood and the wolf, with its not so subtle suggestions of pedophilia (Josh Duggar in a panel van would have been more understated) had a definite ick factor , but I reminded myself that this was a film about fairy tales for adults. However, despite the creep factor of the wolf, this film lacks commitment to being a film about fairy tales for adults. That is it's major problem. When death occurs, a major theme in the story, it is underplayed to such a degree that it is confusing. It is almost as if the director remembered children might be watching and pulled back. Pedophilia is O.K., death might upset the kiddos. This inconsistency really throws the whole film off kilter. I wasn't crazy about the score, either. The whole thing seemed a little sing-song and every song sounded the same. I say that understanding and appreciating Stephen Sondheim's reputation as a genius. Maybe the musical direction was off. I really wanted to like this movie. I wanted to write a review critical of people who just don't understand musicals, or complain that this was not a typical Disney film therefore people don't get  it. Unfortunately, I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone who isn't a die hard musical fan. It just doesn't quite work. It gets lost in the woods.",1442534400,,1902,4.51304347826087

I am not totally againist musicals I like Little Shop of Horrors and Grease however most of the movie the characters were singing their lines and I don't like musicals like that. I am rating it a three because the story line was very interesting the movie had some familiar faces here and there and bit and pieces of various fairy tales here and there blended together. In this movie you see Rapunzel,Little Red Riding Hood and I like how Red Riding Hood is by the way,Cinderella, Jack in the Bean Stock and more.

6861254,1,B00Q7WBGHG,"First, I will say I know nothing of the musical and I probably would not like it in general. But this movie is not a good musical. It is one of those ""musicals"" where everyone badly sings their dialog. I have to admit I never liked those anyway... but here it s particularly poor.  The singing is chopped and hard to understand. But, for what it is... the first half of the movie is pretty good. Several story-lines seamlessly put together.  But then, the movie seems to weirdly - not end... and drift into story lines that I just didn't want to see.  Cinderella's prince becomes a rake intent on straying on her, Cinderella figures out she doesn't really want the prince, people start dying in sad and nasty ways, people are blinded, and everyone in the story starts suffering. If there was any point to any of it, maybe I woudn't be so harsh but there wasn't. I don't watch fairy tales so I can get stressed out. I found myself rather annoyed during most of the movie at how dark and foggy everything was. I suppose someone thought that was a good idea but please.. sometimes there is sun in the deepest forest. Clearly the whole thing was filmed on a sound stage where they saved money to pay for the big names in this film. I hate the recent trend in movies where they change classic stories to try to be edgy or tell a modern story / theme.. and this is one of them.",1442102400,2,1371,4.3062015503875966
6861255,3,B00Q7WBGHG,"I'm not a fan of musicals but this movie wasn't too bad. On the other hand the movie also missed the mark in several ways. Into the Woods has a great cast of stars, although not all of them having main roles. There are in fact several big roles as the narrative moves around from group to group in the movie. Everyone does a good job although when most of the lines are sung it's hard to really tell if someone is acting well or not. The story is interesting with many different fairy tales being mixed together at one singular point where they all meet. On the other hand the story starts to get a bit convoluted with all the different characters, and towards the end of the movie instead of ending at a good point it seems to just keep going on an on. This is the main downfalls of the movie. It wasn't the most interesting movie to begin with and towards the end it's downright boring waiting for it to wrap up. With movies you want the high point to be near the end so the audiences last memories of it are good ones. As for all the singing, there is basically one song with one simple tune that's just repeated over and over. In my experience that isn't unusual for musicals and either you like it or you don't. I thought it was a bit annoying but didn't ruin the movie. The setting is a bit gothic with most of the movie taking place in a scary woods at night. There is plenty of extras if you want to look at it for a good value. If it looks like a movie you'd want to watch based on the cover chances are you'll like it, if not chances are you won't like it",1442102400,,1565,4.084415584415584
6861256,3,B00Q7WBGHG,"The first thing you have to know about this movie is that its Sondheim.  Despite all the images of the Disney castle youll have to look at moving through the menus and trailers, it is first and foremost a Sondheim musical.  Which means its about the failures, neuroses, and re-working that happens after the Happily ever after, not about fairy tales with happy endings.

The second thing you have to know about the movie is that it is performed by actors singing, not singers acting.  That said, the production is musically clean: everyone turns in a professional, highly listenable performance.  Even difficult songs (Your Fault, with its rapid lyrics and fugal entries, is a good example) come off well when they could easily have run off the rails.  But if you were weaned on Bernadette Peters concert versions, you may miss a bit of the fire.

And the third thing youll have to contend with in this move is that it is a Disney-fied version of Sondheim.  Not so badly as to change the endings or remove all of the edge from the piece.  But its impossible to look at the sets without hearing the single word Imagineering whispering in your ear.

Technically, the disc is excellent, both visually and acoustically.  Disney has taken great care with the scene indexing, although at the seemingly at the expense of time as the menus load; its a slow load, even by Blu-ray standards.  The language options are staggering.

The bottom line: this is the movie version to own.  Sondheim purists will wince, but given the expense of this production, the names involved, and a decent compromise between purism and commercial appeal, it is unlikely that a remake will happen anytime soon.  So to paraphrase someone who was speaking of the Supreme Court, this disc may not be the last because its the bestits likely to be the best because its the last.",1442016000,30,1843,4.715625

Both my 9 and 10 year olds watched it with me the second time and loved it. I highly recommend it whether or not you're familiar with the musical itself. It doesn't disappoint. Those who gave it lower stars/ratings seem to do so because it wasn't a typical Disney movie; it's not supposed to be. It is based on the Broadway musical. Like I said, I did not realize that either but it would not change my rating of it. Just understand that before watching.",1441065600,,853,4.3375

6861287,5,B00Q7WBGHG,"As a fan of the musical I was eager and wary about this movie. It turns out they did things really well. They stayed true to the songs and the sentiment of the original. I'm glad they had child actors for the child roles, unlike the stage productions. And they did have to make some adjustments for stage to screen, like eliminating Snow White and Sleeping Beauty was no doubt for the sake of time and to maintain emotional connection with the characters. Who would care about the Witch and Rapunzel if the Prince ran off with another princess? No intermission changes pacing of time in a movie. Also for time, I'm sure, they eliminated the second version of ""Agony.""

It's worth noting that Depp's role is small compared to almost all the other actors. I imagine he's on the cover for publicity rather than importance to the movie itself. Other characters not shown are more important than the Wolf.

As for the other actors, I had doubts about some of them, but simply put, they nailed it. Very well sung and acted. Just writing this makes me want to watch it again.",1440892800,2,1068,4.528497409326425

6861304,4,B00Q7WBGHG,"At first, this film seems a mere amalgam of familiar fairy tales but it soon diverges from the accepted stories and clings to the original versions...Rapunzel's prince is thrown into a briar patch which scratches out his eyes, Cinderella's stepsisters cut off their toes and heels so the slipper will fit..the wolf eats Red Riding Hood and her grandmother and then is cut open so they can escape...and from there it progresses past the proverbial Happily Ever After into Be Careful What You WIsh For...you may get it!  No one lives happily ever after in this tale, each and every character is disappointed in what they thought would give them happiness. IN each case, the character is somewhat in a worse position than before. There are many hidden meanings in the story, especially in Red Riding's Hood encounter with the wolf, in fact every word that lupine creature speaks seems tinged with double meaning...but perhaps I'm reading too much into it. Nevertheless, I felt several psychological papers could be written on that fateful meeting, as well as Red's statement afterward that, ""I learned a lot from this.""

The sets are lovely. There aren't many special effects but what there are were well-done. The songs were a disappointment, however. Generally in a musical, one song sticks out, and is picked up and becomes popular, but here...  The songs seem merely extended dialogue put to music and after a bit I actually became irritated when some character began to sing his thoughts.  Perhaps that was because it was mostly repetition of the same phrase over and over interspersed with a few other words and seemed merely to have been inserted because someone abruptly remembered the film is supposed to be a musical.

Perhaps I simply wasn't in the mood for a musical, although I'd been looking forward to seeing this one. I've been trying to put my finger on the exact spot of disappointment but can't.

I'm giving it 4-stars for the execution, acting, and sets. Apologies, readers, I tried to like it but all I came away with was disappointment.",1440460800,,2055,4.873925501432665

The PLAY centers on the baker and his wife, with the other characters taking close-secondary roles. The MOVIE centers around the witch (of course, Meryl Streep does a wonderful job). Some parts are very well done, with good character interpretation, but overall it was just okay. I don't think it transitioned as well as adaptations of other musicals.

I probably won't watch it more than a couple more times over the years -- I'll watch the stage version repeatedly.",1439683200,,740,5.008130081300813

6861344,5,B00Q7WBGHG,"(1) This movie is based off of a play, and for those who are die hard fans of the original play Disney did not destroy it with this movie adaptation. Most of the time when Disney gets a hold of a play, book, story, concept they change so much of it, that their movie version barely mirrors the original story/book/play. However, the same can not be said about this movie. The movie version of Into The Woods is pretty much the same as the play (at least the version I had seen years ago). Of course, there are more special effects in this movie compared to the play. But the overall flavor of the play can be felt/ seen throughout this film. For example, in the play version (I had seen) the scene with Jack singing about his experience first climbing the beanstalk was left to the imagination. Jack sang about climbing the beanstalk, and dealing with the giant, and the giants wife, but there were no visual representations of castle, giants, or anything else. The audience had to listen to the words in Jack's song and use their imagination to picture the giant, and the castle, and so on. In this movie version it's the same thing. The audience listens to Jack, and you have to imagine most of what he is singing about. I was surprised at this, because Disney tends to put a lot of visuals in their movies.
(2) SOMETHING THAT EVERYONE SHOULD KNOW ABOUT THIS STORY. Due to the fact that this was a Disney movie, most audience members believed that Disney would create characters to look like their versions (for example Cinderella). However, this is not so. There is not one character in this film that represents/ looks like any one Disney character. The play itself was loosely based on the Grim Brother's story version of (most) the characters. For example, in the Grim version of Cinderella the step mother cuts off chunks of her daughters' feet in order to get the slipper to fit. = also in the movie (not gory/don't see anything being cut off). Also, in the original Cinderella, after Cinderella gets married angry birds peck the step sisters eyes out. In this version you do not see the birds attacking the sisters, however, as the movie progresses, the sisters are suddenly blind/using walking canes. For anyone who knows the original story this makes perfect sense. However, if you do not know the original story then it will be confusing. The original fairy tales (before Disney got a hold of them) had darker messages, messages of don't trust outsiders, think before you act, the world is a dangerous place, and in this movie/ and the play the same message remains. DO NOT WATCH THIS EXPECTING A DISNEY STYLE MOVIE BECAUSE YOU WILL NOT FIND IT.
The original story of little red riddinghood had more of the message of a girl becoming a woman (hence the red cape/change of life), and the wolf symbolized the lust of men. The overall message was to stay on a virtues path and do not give into the evils of the world/man otherwise they will devour you. In this movie/ the play this message remains. However, it is not in your face obvious...you are meant to read more into the song the wolf sings. He does not just want to devour the little girl (food wise), he also wants to have relations with her. However, rest assured, there is no inappropriate relations in this film. Most people will simply hear the song and interpret it to be about the wolf seeing red as food.
(4) The movie is beautifully done, in an, almost, gothic style. The acting is excellent, and the singing is wonderful. However, do not expect a lot of special effects. Yes you have the woods, and the witch disappearing in a cloud of dust, and the giant/his wife. For example, for a lack of effects, Depth plays the wolf, but he is dressed more like a man wearing a fur coat, and whiskers...he is not a CG wolf, and does not morph into a CG wolf. How they designed the wolf's look is very much the same as it was in the play version.
(5) I'm not going to lie...I did fast forward one, or two songs. I love this movie/ and the play, however, I can only handle so many songs in a movie/play. And even though this was a well done film, I did not need to hear every freaking song there was (two hour movie). However, this does not mean that other viewers will feel the same way.
(6) The overall message/s of the play/ movie is that you need to be careful what you wish for, no one person is good but no one person is evil either, and we all do things for specific reasons, which can affect others. The woods represent the world, and how unpredictable it can be, especially with all the different people in the world looking for/ and doing anything they want in order to obtain their worldly needs/desires. Also, how nothing is black or white. For example there is a scene/ song related to red riddinghood. She began to have doubts about killing the giant's wife. Cinderella then sings a song which is about not seeing the world as black and white. ""Some times witches can be right, and giants good."" The song is really about you need to do what you feel is right for you. The overall message/s of the film are refreshing.
I especially loved the cold hard fact that despite Cinderlla belief that she had found prince charming, that he was in reality shallow, and a cheat (like in the real world). There is no happy endings in life, only continuations, uncertainty, and change, and this movie reflects those themes as well. DO NOT EXPECT DISNEY!!!!!!!! Only expect a brilliant film that has been based on a musical/play, which itself is based on the original, darker, fairy tales
(6) would I let my children watch this???????? Yes, but only the older ones. Personally I don't think that younger children would keep an interest in this film (a lot of singing in the woods). This movie is meant for a more mature audience. However, if your younger child should watch it there are some deaths (but nothing too graphic), very little to no blood (Cinderela's step sisters feet are cut but you don't see it- only hear the step mother singing about it as she holds a knife). As for the prince cheating on Cinderalla there is no nudity, no sexual suggestions...only a kissing scene with the baker's wife.
So, it is up to you if you wish to journey into the woods. I have been into the woods, and I intend to go back someday. ""Into the woods, and out of the woods""!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1439510400,2,6350,4.503466204506066

First, this must be the first film by Disney with the word ""raping"" in one of the songs.
Second, Disney now appears to be pushing moral relativism with  the lyrics ""You decide what is right; you decide what is good,"" as if objective moral standards, e.g. adultery is wrong, do not exist.
Third, Disney is now pushing gender confusion on children with the statement that one can ""Be father and mother.""
Fourth, did you know that a wife engaged in a tryst will help her love her husband more? According to this film, infidelity is a moral good.

Walt Disney Studios will have to work hard to redeem itself in the eyes of many parents by turning 180 degrees and producing a film that is not only entertaining (""Into the Woods"" is not) but also socially responsible.",1439078400,2,942,4.529411764705882

6861365,5,B00Q7WBGHG,"This is a wonderful (maybe not perfect) rendition of one of the best musicals ever written!! It's not a kids movie for little ones (do your research) so of course it doesn't hold their attention. IT was never written for them, it really is more for an adult audience although I think it is fine for kids, but not all happy-go-lucky. I actually think they made it a bit too soft in avoiding the death scenes (as a huge fan from the original musical). However, some things must change to make the story a better movie than a musical and I think this is quite well done.",1438905600,,567,4.308411214953271

6861375,1,B00Q7WBGHG,This movie had such great potential.  The story line was interesting and the cast was phenomenal.  But the songs were boring and nothing that anyone would want to learn or sing along with or ever listen to again.  I was so disappointed!,1438560000,,236,4.571428571428571

6861378,2,B00Q7WBGHG,"This film is really not a musical; it is more or less an operetta because most of the dialogue is sung rather than spoken.  The only operetta that
I liked had Laurel and Hardy in it.  This movie is fairly well produced with a good cast, but unlike most of Disney's modern ""fairy tales"" this one lacks
the feeling of fantasy, at least to me.  The sets generally good, especially the Woods scenes, but the Castle of the Prince looked like something out
of the South Bronx or Detroit!  Where were the shinning spires, turrets and elaborate carvings and statues one would expect in a fairy tale castle?
And how about the Prince? Not a bad looking guy if he knew about the business end of a razor, and he had a bit of a""pot""!  And he also apparently
quite a womanizer like Bill ""I like the ladies"" Clinton!  One lovely Princess is not enough, I suppose.  But its good to be the King!  Anyhow,  children
may like it, but it is extremely long.  The only full length opera that I saw was a PBS production of THE RING OF THE DWARVES, which was
about 17 hours long over a period of a week I believe.  I watched most of it because I like mythological stories along with ""adult"" fairy tales, but
quote the Raven, ""Nevermore"".  It may have inspired J.R.R. TolkIien to write the LOTR.  Interesting, but not again.  This has some charm, but it
just doesn't strike a favorable nerve in me.  I got my DVD from Amazon as usual.  But I only give it 2 Stars because I feel the story was too long and
a bit disjointed, and lacked the spirit of the several stories in this photoplay.  But who knows, perhaps the reader will enjoy it; It has a VERY GOOD
ending!  But it is not my cup of fairy tale tea.  Others seem to like it so perhaps  I am wrong.  Enjoy!",1438473600,,1735,4.228658536585366

No worries.

There were many characters but I didn't feel like I could connect with any of them. There was some humor but it wasn't enough to justify watching the entire movie.

Besides that, there were such pleasant musings about the greatness of infidelity. Just what the world needs more of :-/  Then there was the message about how not all giants are bad, they're not alone, maybe we should forgive this one ... No, let's kill the giant.

Costumes are remarkable  To me it's worth watching several times just to study them - but that's not the only thing that hooks me.
Sondheim's music turns into earworms.  I suppose this would be called an ""operetta""...  More song that spoken words and in many cases the spoken word is delivered in a format that was called Talking Blues when I was younger, is called Rap now - but delivery is not Blues or Rap - it Sonheim without the melody.
And Sondheim's melodies go around some Very Unexpected corners before they wrap around into the next one.

I like musicals (I own several) but this music is really annoying (too much rhyming - lousy tunes). It doesn't even make good background noise. What a waste of money. I'll be donating this to the local thrift store.  Too bad, as it has a good cast; I liked the general plot (just not all the annoying music and singing); there ARE English subtitles and a bonus feature (but I didn't waste my time watching it).

I think it is well done and I played in the pit orch for this musical, and saw it live twice.
I like this rendition. It seems to flow well, good special effects, and drawing audience in like it would on stage.

This is not a musical---to be a musical, it would have to contain music.  This has caterwauling and screeching set to the noises of those ""musical"" instruments which they hand out to pre-schoolers to beat on.  Too bad they hired a crew with less talent than the kindergarteners would have produced.

Plot?  The rambling of those same kindergarteners who should have been beating on their sticks and tambourines would have more coherence and imagination.

Character development?  Nonexistant.  Not the slightest reason to care what happened to the random screeching banshees on the screen--other than the wish they'd all go away so the torture would end.  Gitmo prisoners know and care more about the CIA agent pouring water down their pie hole than one can care about the vacuous characters in this stinker.

The makers should be class-action sued for punitive damages due to the intentional damage and distress they caused to anyone suckered into watching this bucket of putrid maggot-infested rotting trash.

On a positive note, this movie has a good chance of going down in history as one of the worst ever made.  Maybe with a little more marketing they can still make back the money wasted making this cow-pie by convincing the public that this might make a great gag gift for people you dislike.",1436400000,2,1545,4.873563218390805

6861521,5,B00Q7WBGHG,"I loved this musical growing up and now my 7 year old daughter loves it. For those who were turned off by the story, a little research may have helped. This is meant to be a dark storyline. It is cynical and attempts to point out the follies of the world (Riding hood trusts the ""bad man"", Prince Charming is not very charming after all, tetc.)  If you didn't know that first, you might be uncomfortable watching it. But, it is dark, as are most Stephen Sondheim musicals (think Sweeney Todd---the murdering barber). Could be scary for some kids, but my daughter who is obsessed with Maleficent, it was right up her alley. For adults, if you pay attention, there are great social mores and morals discussed.",1435881600,,707,4.566929133858268

6861527,5,B00Q7WBGHG,Into the Woods is very original in the way it develops and concludes its story and for the fact that it is a musical/comedy while mixing in some good discussion points at the same time.  With that said it is a very odd movie one that you will either love or hate its not a typical fairy tale with a happily ever after ending it goes for a more realistic ending in a movie where nothing is realistic.

This is not a reason to skip it but just realize that you will end on a somber note.  But, I really must commend the cast for a great job!  I saw this for the 1st time while flying first class back to the USA.  Once back in the USA, I bought it from Amazon on their Fire TV streaming service.  Very glad that I did.",1435276800,,585,4.088495575221239

6861567,3,B00Q7WBGHG,"Well, this version is certainly pretty, but it replaces the magic of the 1991 stage production (Bernadette Peters, Chip Zein, Joanna Gleason, et. al.) with mere, if flashy, special effects.  Streep is always good, but she lacks the edginess and snap of Peters, and the Baker's Wife lacks the sexuality Gleason brought to the role.  All of the actors in this film are good; they are just not compelling.

One of the great problems of bringing a stage play to film is that film can go everywhere (and too often does), while the stage has to make do with the 40 feet or so open to view.  The 1991 production is essentially a filming of the staged musical:  it is tightly focused and solves the problem of multiple scenes with clever design work.  The film does it by covering miles of real estate (whether or not done by green screen is immaterial), and with all that space the focus evaporates and the actors move around far too much to fill it.  Their characters get lost in choreography.  While the play is about fairy tale persons encountering reality, there is such a thing as too much reality, particularly of trivial things.  Yes, Disney has real dirt, but, unlike grave spoil, real dirt does not advance the plot an inch.  Milky White is a real ambulating cow, but I much preferred the symbolic one with wheels and a suitcase handle.  No imagination goes into the creating of a real cow (particularly now that the sires may be a continent away from the dams):  the 1991 version creates an imitation cow brilliantly.  This film plods in the stage's footsteps, some distance behind.

The 1991 version is available here.  Get it.",1435190400,,1631,4.634146341463414
6861568,5,B00Q7WBGHG,"With the resurgence of fairytale mash ups in TV shows, middle grade novels, and other pop culture, its hardly surprising that a studio decided it was time to make a big screen version of the musical Into the Woods.  After all, it was mixing up fairytales on Broadway back in the late 80s, and has developed a large fan base.  I count myself among them since I was introduced to a filmed version of the original Broadway cast production about 15 years ago.  As a result, Ive been looking forward to this film all year.  I am very happy with the results.

This movie tells the story of a Baker (James Corden) and his Wife (Emily Blunt) who wish to have a child.  As our story opens, they learn from their neighbor, a Witch (Meryl Streep), that they are under a curse from something that the Bakers father had done years before.  However, they have a chance to reverse the curse by getting items for a potion for her.  They need a cow as white a milk, hair as yellow as corn, a cape as red as blood, and a slipper as pure as gold.

As luck would have it, their search for those items in the nearby woods coincides with the stories of Jack of Beanstalk fame (Daniel Huttleston), Red Riding Hood (Lilla Crawford), and Cinderella (Anna Kendrick).  Will the Baker and his Wife get all the items by the deadline?  Will they keep the others from getting their happy ending?

This is a very fun mash up of all these stories held together by the new tale of the Baker and his Wife.  Things pretty much go the way youd expect, but there is plenty of fun to be had along the way.  I and the audience I was with were laughing at several of the scenes and lines.

About two thirds of the way through the film, things do take an unexpected turn and become darker.  This is where I like to say the story turns more adult, but just because of the more serious nature of the story.  I absolutely agree with the PG rating of the movie, but there is nothing that comes close to warrant it getting something higher.  The darker moments are tastefully done and in keeping with other PG movies.

The cast truly shines in this film.  I was expecting a great performance from Meryl Streep because, lets face it, can she give a bad performance?  The rest of the cast matched her performance completely.  Even though I was already familiar with the story, I was surprised by some of the nuances that the actors put into their performances  just subtle things that made the film much better than the Broadway performance Ive watched numerous times.  (Of course, the stage doesnt allow for some of that subtly, but thats a different issue.)  This praise flows all the way down to the young cast of Daniel Huttleston and Lilla Crawford.  A special note for Johnny Depp fans - despite how he was billed in the movie, he really only has a couple of small scenes near the beginning.

The fact that this is a movie allowed them to stage some of the musical numbers more creatively.  We actually got to see a touch of Jacks journey up the beanstalk in his big song, for example.  However, the song that stood out to me the most was The Steps of the Palace.  The creative way they did it added some fun to a song Ive always enjoyed and made it much better.

I must also praise Agony.  Again, Ive always liked the humor of this song, but this song now brings down the house.  Chris Pratt and Billy Magnussen absolutely kill it in this scene.  Honestly, it makes me very sad that they left out the reprise of the song from the second act.

Yes, fans of the musical will certainly notice differences.  Its most noticeable in the second act when they compress the time between acts and cuts parts of this section of the story.  Even with the cuts, the emotional punch of this section is just as strong.  I saw it with my roommate, who knew little of the story, and he loved it, too. Obviously, this section isn't weakened by the cuts.  Yes, there are moments I wish theyd included, and Cinderella seems a bit quick in some of her actions, but its a minor point.  This is something only those who love the stage show will miss, and even then its a small point.

Of course, the one thing I was definitely looking forward to with a big screen version was the sets and special effects.  Here, the movie completely hit it out of the park.  It looks like they are really in the woods.  The magic is perfect.  We see the beanstalk.  You couldn't ask for a better movie visually if you tried.

While fans of the stage show will certainly miss a few moments, everyone will be glad they took this trip Into the Woods.  I will definitely be buying this movie when it his Blu-Ray and enjoying many repeat trips through this enchanted and musical forest.",1435104000,,4700,4.3544303797468356

6861593,4,B00Q7WBGHG,"Have to say i was caught in two minds with this one, the critics and reviewers were indeed in two camps, some hated it,
some loved it, after cancelling and re-ordering a couple of times, i gave in to my love of Disney down the years..........
The story entwines several fairy tales merging them in to the lives of the 'Baker' (James Corden) and his wife played by
'Emily Blunt' who to undo a wicked curse bestowed upon them by the Witch (Meryl Streep) to have the child they crave
they must deliver to her a 'White Cow' that is being led to market by 'Jack' (Daniel Huttlestone) - 'Red Riding Hood's (Lilla
Crawford) Red-Cape - 'Cinderella's' (Anna Kendrick) Golden-Slippers and locks of her daughter 'Repunzel's' (Makenzie Mauzy)
Hair.
So into the Woods the Baker and his Wife go, to try and collect that which the Witch has demanded in return for the lifting of
the curse..........so starts the caper in the woods playing out the fairy tales in - song and with perhaps a different twist.
Just when you think it's Happily-Ever-After - things begin to take a turn for the worse for the characters of the Kingdom - all
because of a sixth 'Bean' that had been discarded.........a new quest now unfolds........Once-Upon-A-Time indeed.......
The film certainly has an all-star cast which also includes - 'Chris Pine' (Cinderella's Prince) - 'Billy Magnussen' (Rapunzel's
Prince) and for good measure - 'Johnny Depp' (as the Wolf)
It's fair to say that not all cast-members have great singing-voices, however how the film has been set up it wasn't really necessary
everything came together in a delightful way.
The film is charming and very enjoyable, maybe not everyone's bag, though in my view 'Disney' did make a good job of bringing
several tales into just the one.
Good Picture and Sound Quality throughout.

Almost EVERYTHING  is sung. Johnny Depp is a great wolf & he can sing, too as well. All of the many & actresses & actors involved were good in their performances but there were some areas that got a little boring.  These are NOT the ""fairy tales"" Disney has taught you to expect & they are not the fairy tales that the Grimm's Brothers or other famous storytellers have told you.

6861665,5,B00Q7WBGHG,"The movie I give 5 stars. Even though they kind of butchered the source material a little, I understand they did it not only with Sondheim's approval, but he even wrote an original composition for it *Last Midnight.""

Amazon's streaming service I give only 2 stars. This was my first experience with Amazon streaming. While video and audio quality were good, the movie kept freezing up. It wasn't a bandwidth issue, the video just stopped streaming. I had to refresh the window, then resume the movie. To their credit for the most part it did pick up where it left off. But this happened 5 or 6 times during the movie. Very frustrating.

ADDED LATER: In all fairness I must add this - days later, unsolicited, Amazon credited my account in full for the poor streaming experience of this movie. That was very upstanding of them to do, and makes me believe that the streaming is not usually this bad (otherwise they couldn't afford to refund everyone.) I will give Amazon Instant Video another chance. So revise the D below to a C for streaming because of their responsive refund policy.",1434153600,,1085,4.675392670157068

6861680,3,B00Q7WBGHG,"I rented this movie with relatively high expectations and found them dissatisfied. There were quite a few big named actors like Meryl Streep and Johnny Depp. The acting was commendable, the vocals... not so much. I don't expect Grammy winning music from people not in that particular profession and for that I got what I expected. It wasn't completely horrible, although there were some cringe-worthy notes (from Chris Pine mostly).
That was not what I found displeasing. That honor goes to the plot. I went into the story thinking that they would take bits from some of my favorite childhood stories and remake them for me to be enjoyable as an adult. Instead I found my precious childhood memories altered. Although the originals had some rather dark themes to them Disney had taken a few of them and morphed them in to stories where the good guy won and the Prince wasn't a jerk. Yes, I know that it was rather unrealistic, but as a kid we really don't need to find out about the darker parts of life from movies. They'll learn all of that by living life. So it was rather sad to find that instead of sticking to the Disney plots they chose to add some of  life's unfortunate realities. I would have been happy even with the way it was originally written, but instead they chose to make some depressing additions. I walked away from this movie without the hope that the former stories gave me, even though that is what the creators obviously intended in the end.",1433894400,,1465,4.591603053435114

But this was about two hours I can't ever get back, and $5. Not worth it. I am also a Meryl Streep fan, and I love a good fairy tale. Conceptually, this seemed like an intriguing idea - weave together some key elements from classic tales for a new and intriguing story. But they deviated from the stories completely at the end, for a less-than-worthy result. And the music? Really? No... Just no. Way too much singing, not enough storytelling. I can't undo this (the wasting of a good Saturday night, and the visuals and sounds that stuck in my head and ears) and frankly, I'd like to.",1433894400,,756,4.4855072463768115

The music is composed incredibly well! The actors did a phenomenal job performing an older (not quite old enough in my opinion to rank as a classic yet) very popular musical. I usually don't like when a musical has been taken from the stage and put into movie form, but this one did not disappoint at all! I highly recommend this to everyone of all ages! There are life lessons that are being taught based on old fairy tale classics. This movie is a must see!

6861740,3,B00Q7WBGHG,"I knew Into the Woods was a musical going in but some of these songs were pretty average, I wondered if I would be able to sit through the whole song with the terrible opening song, something about going into the woods, to go the festival, well I'm just happy I can't remember that again. The songs do improve after that one but there's times when the movie would have flowed better if the dialogue had been spoken rather than sung. The other main problem with Into the Wood was that it was inconsistent in what age group it wanted to market, at one point Johnny Depp eats Little Red Riding Hood and she is still alive cartoon style inside him and screaming which attracted The Baker. Then she emerges unchewed, burnt by gastric juices. I mean if she was going to be eaten, just let her die there and then and have The Baker go oh well she's dead, but hey now I've got the cloak. But then later in the film they go with the traditional cutting off toes and heals of the ugly step sisters to squeeze into the slipper that those who retell Riding Hood without anyone getting eaten leave out. So picking an audience before production would have been a good idea.

On The Wolf, seriously they couldn't afford a bit more wolf appearance type costume. this is like something a school play with no budget would come up with. Did Johnny Depp just turn up on set looking like that refusing to put on the costume and they didn't want another Pirates of the Caribbean sequel fiasco where he keeps holding up production for months at a time as he disappears home, so just went with it? I originally just thought his character wasn't supposed to be an actual wolf and just a human child predator but then we have the eat the grandma and child thing.

The acting isn't that bad, and the singing voices by the actors usually quite good, we just needed less songs, culling some of the worst ones. You do wonder why the Baker and his wife didn't just decide to adopt an orphan (there were plenty around back then) rather than risk death in the woods, steal and do other nasty things to others. Plus how does a prince and everyone else not know who the woman he dances with three nights in a row is when there is such a small population in his kingdom anyway?",1433548800,,2241,4.3460620525059666

Even if I did, musicals that I'm used to are acceptable because all the dialogue is spoken, with songs peppered in to advance the story.  I'd guestimate that about 95% of the dialogues/monologues are sung.  And it gave me a raging headache.

Looking at some negative reviews it seems some people didn't know what to expect, but my kids are older and we knew it was musical mashup of several Grimm's fairy tales that were related as the brothers Grimm originally wrote them so we were not disappointed. The stories being told with memorable songs and incredibly talented actors had us all in agreement it was one of the best Disney musicals we've ever seen.

Spoiler Alert!

The theme to most of Grimm's fairy tales was basically to teach children that there may be dire consequences for being greedy or not abiding by your parents rules, and this musical leans towards this original theme rather than the sugar coated versions told to children for the past several decades.",1433462400,,842,4.8

6861757,3,B00Q7WBGHG,"Well, let me say first, this is more of a fairytale movie for a more mature mind: kids would be either bored or upset. The movie basically takes the harsher lessons from the original Grimms tales and puts a modern day twist which lets your mind decide whether the big bad wolf is just ""really hungry"" or has more lascivious issues, has Cinderella a decent enough sort except that she seems to use her birds in dastardly revenge plots, Jack in the beanstalk is bordering on being a theif and I'm not quite sure what his relationship with the giants wife was...ah well, it goes on and on. It seems that Disney is trying to go back to its old self which was not always politically correct...I'm sure I see some stereotypes in there. I had always thought I liked Stephen Sondheim's music; but it seems a bit repetitious in this age. I always thought I liked musicals; but this has none of the fresh bounciness of the old 60s Rogers and Hammerstein's. Now this may seem like I hated this; but actually, it kept me interested, often appalled, often laughing at the antics of the characters. The baker and his wife are sweet...she's a bit naughty; but human. Johnny Depp...well, I love Johnny; but Disney didn't quite do him justice. I love Tracy Ulman in this. The cow was a great actor too...Christopher Pine is really hot...as usual. I would suggest watching it at home. I watched it over 2 days with plenty of bathroom and snack breaks.",1433376000,2,1433,4.536679536679537
6861758,4,B00Q7WBGHG,"This movie version is quite wonderful and there are wonderful performances by the children, the Baker and his wife and Cinderella but I am so disappointed that the climax song 'No more' was left out.

I agreed to watch this with my son (11) who does like musicals. There are some very good actors in this, and some really good voices. The sets are well done. I found the fractured fairytale lacking, and just not enough likeable characters. There were too many mistakes, not enough cohesion of story. I'm not into dreary.

The song AGONY was very funny and very well done and is, in my opinion, the only really good piece in the movie. Chris Pine and his prince brother were excellent in this scene.",1433030400,,633,4.319327731092437

I ended up buying this version because I feel like DVD is on it's way out, but as I don't have a blu-ray player yet, I essentially just purchased a digital copy.  But still, it's totally worth it, as the movie is great!  I do appreciate that Disney toned it down from the original play a bit so that it's more kid friendly now.",1432771200,,491,4.247311827956989

6861898,5,B00Q7WBGHG,"Disney, the master of musicals, does not disappoint as their director, Rob Marshall, brings us a pitch-perfect cinematic adaption of one of the most unique and biting Broadway productions of our time.  Marshall captures all of the quick and dark humor of  Sondheim's wonderfully warped, more literary accurate, harmonious retelling of some of the most beloved and despised fairy tales.  The stellar cast effortlessly brings all of the life, lasciviousness, and lament of his original characters, so much so, that anyone's living or rec room instantaneously becomes a vicarious visit to the theater.  I have seen many musical masterpieces retooled to fit in the limited proportions of the silver screen, or in this case, the flat screen.  But few have had the impact, energy, engagement, and effectiveness of this newest upstart.  Kudos to the Mighty Mouse for truly honoring the magic of such a contemporary masterpiece.  Now to the daunting task of finding a way to repel the incessantly snappy and delightful tunes that now beleaguer both my waking and unconscious hours.  I guess there could be far worse repercussions.",1432598400,,1122,5.194444444444445

And while the plot changes and scene omissions do detract from the story, this version is extremely well done. Streep is great, as always, despite having to compete with the stellar portrayal by Bernadette Peters, and other standout moments are Johnny Depp's sleezy wolf, the princes' duet, and Anna Kendrick on the steps. The two kids' singing is also fantastic. If you're a Sondheim purist, skip this. But I'm happy to watch this group of actors perform this masterpiece any time.",1432598400,,615,4.703703703703703

6861918,5,B00Q7WBGHG,"I'm reviewing the streamed theatrical version of Into The Woods.  I knew it had been a musical, but unfortunately, I have never seen the musical.  I wasn't sure what to expect from the movie.  I hadn't read anything about it before watching it.  I didn't even know the movie had kept the musical genre.  It took a bit while watching to get used to it's musical genre and the style of the writing of the lines.  I wasn't sure I liked it at first.  I wasn't even sure I'd finish watching it.  But ... then, I can't remember exactly at what point, I found myself laughing out loud, and I knew I was hooked!

The actors were amazing!  James Corden has been one of my favorite actors ever since I first saw him on Doctor Who.  He was amazing as the Baker.  It was fun to recognize Johnny Depp as the wolf.  Meryl Streep played the witch extremely well and was rather unrecognizable until I heard her speak.  The two Princes were great and made me laugh a lot!  Emily Blunt was very moving as the Baker's wife, and Anna Kendrick was a terrific Cinderella.  Yes, she can speak to birds.  Speaking of birds ... well I won't spoil the surprises for you.  (cough Hitchcock)  Lilla Crawford was absolutely amazing as Red Riding Hood, and Daniel Huddlestone played a fantastic Jack.

I loved the way the stories played out.  It really makes you think.  Life has so much gray to it depending on what perspective you look at a situation from.  I loved that this movie/musical showed that so well.  I also like the lesson of ""Be careful what you wish for"", and how actions interact and cause ripples of actions from others.

I now must see the musical itself sometime.  The music is excellent, and the lines have an amazing style to them.

I highly recommend this movie!  Give it a try!",1432425600,2,1771,4.3993808049535605

I enjoyed the behind the scenes as well as the DVD itself. It came quicky after I  had  ordered it. A fun musical, great satire.",1432425600,,429,3.9080459770114944

6861923,5,B00Q7WBGHG,"INTO THE WOODS is a grand fairy tale with some familiar story lines and a big twist in their happy endings, leading to a new ending for the combined story lines. The film version has surprisingly little CGI effects and features a visual style that might be termed ""magical realism."" It's a beautiful film to watch.

But I enjoy this movie mainly because Stephen Sondheim's music and lyrics are presented as the natural language of the story. It's not entirely sung, but the transitions between speaking and singing are so smooth that the singing sounds like heightened emotion that comes naturally--this is just the way these characters communicate. This picture reminds me why I love musicals, which are rare in contemporary film, and which are most beguiling when the singing roles are performed by real singers, as they are in this film.

Blessings on Disney for bringing this musical experience to movie audiences, and heartfelt thanks to the marvelous company behind and in front of this picture, and deepest gratitude to the original creators of the show, James Lapine and Stephen Sondheim.",1432339200,,1096,5.016483516483516

Still with the singing and there was some bad choices for songs like Johnny Depp. I still thought he looked great but that song was horrible. Overall it watched it from start to finish because I wanted to see what happened but it was not as enjoyable a movie as I was expecting. Some of the acting was bad and the songs were terrible. Not one of the best movies of the year like everyone says. But than again people who rate those movies are usually rating them based on artistic ability  and not anything else.

6861949,5,B00Q7WBGHG,"Many years ago I remember seeing Into the Woods on stage and I know I liked it.  So, when I first saw that the movie was coming out, I was eager to see it.  I read a review that was sour on the film because it said the film should have been rated differently since it dealt with more adult themes (adulterous thoughts for example).  So, I waited to see it on Amazon Prime instead.  And, I was glad I took time to see the film.  It helped me to remember how much I like musical theater and how the songs, which can be complex, were artfully woven together.  It also helped me to remember the basic story of the film, that who we are and how we live is important, especially regarding the message it sends to our children (for good or for ill). In the end, it is a moral tale that causes one to reflect.  When I saw the musical on stage I was not a parent.  Now I have a grown son and the film really hit me in regards how as parents we need to honor that we do our best, and to forgive ourselves for our mistakes, while learning to be better along the way.

I sat down to watch it with my mom and dad and when I heard the first song, I was unpleasantly surprised.  We had NO idea it was a musical and I usually like musicals.  The songs were horrible.  They all sounded the same.  The only song I vaguely remember is a song called ""Agony"" and that's because it was agony trying to sit through this movie.  After 20 minutes of watching this movie, I wanted to go back to room but I didn't want to leave my parents in the living room all by themselves.  And a lot of people have talked about how Johnny Depp's song to little red riding hood was creepy.  It was.  I'm not going to lie.  But what really freaked me out was when the evil stepmother chopped her daughters' toes off so their feet would fit into the glass slipper.  My jaw hit the floor!  I tried to stay awake but boredom overtook me, and went to sleep in the living room.  My only wish now is that we could've rented this movie instead of buying it, that way, I could've avoided wasting my hard-earned money.

6862091,1,B00Q7WBGHG,"I really looked forward to this movie. Being an avid fan of fairy tale themed stories and a musical lover, I felt this would be entirely up my alley. I am severely disappointed.

First, the story line was bizarre. The longer it went on the worse it became. I felt as though the movie extended a good 45 minutes past where it should have ended. The entire story felt very out of sync. The scenery was amazingly boring considering it was supposed to be an enchanted forest. The acting was decent enough but because 95% of it is completely musical, the delivery was all over the place. Johnny Depp as the Big Bad Wolf was creepy. The characters themselves held true to the story line representation the movie was going for, but by the end of the film, I couldn't tolerate a single one.

Second, the music was terrible. I'd rather them have spoken the lines in verse than put it to music. There was very little variation in any of the tunes and each song felt like it lasted an entire day. The opening sequence is literally 15 minutes long and within that song it is the same 10 notes sung over and over. I cannot say enough bad things for the composition. The singing was alright, but digitized obviously in places and flat/shrill in others. It was really painful to listen to which was made worse by the fact that it seemed to extend much longer than I cared to listen.

Ultimately, I did force myself to watch it to the end. I spent the last 40 minutes of the film cringing at every plot development and change. This comment is a bit spoil-ish so stop reading now if you haven't yet watched this.  I get what they were going for with the anti-happy ending but there were so many other ways that it could have been done that would be either sad, entertaining, or acceptable. What they chose was just another nail into the coffin.

In summation, here are other live action fairy tale movies and musicals that you should watch instead of this movie:
The 10th Kingdom - NBC miniseries  // Mirror Mirror  //  Ever After  //  Ella Enchanted  //  Sydney White  //  Princess Bride  //  Enchanted  //  Stardust  //  Peter Pan 2003 Version  //  Legend

Here are other current musical films which provide much better content:
Sweeney Todd  //  Chicago //  Little Shop of Horrors // Hairspray // The Phantom of the Opera 25th Anniversary  // Annie // Across the Universe // Moulin Rouge // (Not yet on film but very worth it if playing near you: Wicked)",1431302400,2,2440,4.44920993227991

There were many visuals that were so over the top they were just absurd like the wolf belly scene, the insta-pregnancy, Agony, & the Step of the Palace. I really missed some of the songs they cut out, especially since they add so much to the overall feel in the movie in Act 2.

6862137,5,B00Q7WBGHG,"Into the the Woods was really fun and interesting to watch. I like how there was no simple happy ending and the theme that Cinderella and the Baker sang to the children about how there was no such thing as only right or only wrong. I also liked how although based on fairy tales, it had a darker theme and aspect to it, although the defeat of the last enemy at the end and the witch was really ant-climatic. Surprisingly, the character that I sympathized the most with was the witch: she was a victim of the Baker's father robbing her garden, leading to her mother's curse taking into effect which resulted in her seeking the items to lift her curse that then caused the incident. She raised Rapunzel with all of her love, only to be left behind by her in the end, although it is understandable; one of the witch's theme is how parents have to let go of their children when they grow old. Her death is caused by despair: from the abandonment of her adopted daughter, lingering grudges on all involved with her mother's curse, and in the end, having to take the blame for all of the casts' mistakes. She says so herself, that she would allow them all to blame her as she is only a witch whereas they were the world, meaning that they represent the majority of society in their view that she is a witch and is thus bad. She also has hilarious moments in which she appears out of nowhere! Also, I found the scene in which the princes' compete to see who is the most in agony because of their love extremely funny and ironic, because as later stated by Cinderella's prince, he was only known for being charming, not sincerity. This shows the flaw in the stereotype of princes, and yet Rapunzel's princes serves to contrast that as he continues to love Rapunzel in the end(Rapunzel and her prince disappear completely from the story after they leave the witch)? Anyways, bottom line, I liked this show.",1431043200,,1897,4.454022988505747

6862145,5,B00Q7WBGHG,Sondheim always makes you think while entertaining you tremendously.  This is well done.  Is the cinematography as dark as I think?  I think that people are so out of the habit of movie musicals that they didn't give this one much attention.  That was a mistake.,1431043200,,262,4.630434782608695

I was pleasantly surprised by how good the singing is by people I don't think of as singers (like Chris Pine, Meryl Streep, and Emily Blunt). The music is the best part of this movie. I liked the music the first time I heard it, which is very unusual for me. The plot is amusing and quite inventive. Not a lot of action, but frankly you should buy this DVD for the music, not the plot. The singing of Anna Kendrick is especially good, as is that of newcomer Lilla Crawford (Little Red Riding Hood). For you Johnny Depp fans, his role (as Red Riding Hood's wolf)  is little more than a cameo.",1431043200,,664,4.354838709677419

As a long-time lover of the Into the Woods musical and Stephen Sondheim, I was skeptical of how a Hollywood version of the story would stay true to the original. While yes, the movie was shorter and missing several elements from the original, it did not take away from the amazing performances offered by the actors, nor the story as a whole (and really, no one is going to sit in a theater for a 3-hour musical). As always, Anna Kendrick is absolutely amazing, and I was (again, as always) surprised by Chris Pine's wonderful performance. I saw this in theaters twice, because it was just too wonderful to pass up seeing it and hearing it on the big screen, and bought it immediately when it was released.

From a technical sense. The music was good, and the acting was super. Here I would give it 4 stars.

I think this movie falls in the category of you either like or dislike it, there is no In-between. So all in all 2 stars because I weigh family friendly more than acting and director skills.",1430870400,,559,4.314285714285714

6862218,2,B00Q7WBGHG,"Into the Woods could have been a much better movie. With fairy tale characters (played by A-list actors) assembled into the same universe, the film attempts to explore the darker side of the tales they are from. It is a nice idea (no wonder, as it is based on a Stephen Sondheim musical), to be sure. If only someone else had made it into the movie.

Into the Woods is a Disney movie and this movie does not know its target audience. The film opens with a famous Disney castle logo, but it is definitely not for children. For anyone who knows the background of the source material, Into the Woods would be at best an average adaptation. While trying to explore the darker sides of fairy tales, it ends up scratching the surface. The film is directed by Rob Marshall, who is  with all respect  no Guillermo del Toro or no Terry Gilliam.

But perhaps the greatest miscalculation on the part of the filmmakers is that it took about thirty years for them to turn the original musical (debuted in 1986) into a movie. These days everyone knows our favorite fairy tales are really dark and twisted, thanks to many films based on or inspired by them. Take a look at such recent adaptations like Maleficent, Mirror, Mirror, Sleepy Hollow and Red Riding Hood as well as (much better and darker) Pan's Labyrinth.

Into the Wood is not a terrible film adaptation. It is beautifully shot, but bland and too tame. The fact that Disney made Into the Woods is probably the greatest irony you find in this dark musical.",1430697600,,1502,4.527675276752768

This film is so wonderful as an adaptation of the Broadway show.

Meryl Streep can do anything....and does it all well.  Tracey Ullman is a terrific actress and singer.  The rest of the cast, as well, were  astonishing.  The performances and songs are incredible in this film.

Everything about this film was more than I expected from a Hollywood interpretation of a Broadway musical.  It is a film rendition of the same musical....the same songs, the same themes, wonderful performances, terrific singing, amazing artwork and set design.  Every performer in this film should be proud because THIS a fantastic movie!

Obviously, I didn't expect this film to be exactly like the play; how can it be?  They are two totally different mediums.  I think this film did justice to the play and is a terrific movie in its own right.

6862251,4,B00Q7WBGHG,"I loved this movie. But I figured I'd address both sides of the argument here
As for the low reviews complaining about the movie and ""poor values""

These people clearly don't get it. 1. It's a musical, nearly all musicals feature a reprise of a song that represents a central theme. If you knew about musicals that wouldn't bother you
The people complaining about the bad lessons and poor values I guess expected to see a typical Disney movie with happy endings and relatively PG themes. This isn't the case with this musical that sets out to give you the ""real world"" ending to our favorite tales, some actually respecting their original origins.

However, if you've seen the musical live before you know this movie was toned down a bit. You'll notice it was actually Disney-fied a little bit.
And you'll also notice that they showed an awful lot of Johnny Depp for virtually no reason.
The movie isn't without its faults all movies are like that, but as far as the other reviewers are concerned they have found none of them. So the only ones they have to blame for their low ratings are themselves",1430524800,,1099,4.6020408163265305

It was a waste of money and I wish I could unseen it. The ending made no sense and they butchered the Cinderella fairytale. The songs all sounded the same with very little variation to them. And the bakers wife did something  near the end that seemed an about face from the character they had  built all through the movie. You don't take fairytales like Cinderella and totally screw them up. For part of the Cinderella tale they followed the traditional Grim story but then they just went in a weird way with it.

6862280,3,B00Q7WBGHG,"Thought-provoking. ""Into The Woods"" is a lesson about choices and consequences woven very uniquely in a somewhat dark and twisted fairy tale musical. If you're looking for a sweet, straightforward fairytale like ""Cinderella"", this isn't it. If you're looking for a fairytale that turns an old story on its head like ""Maleficent"", this isn't it either. But what you will get is an unusual tale that delves into the realities of life: love, hate, forgiveness, death, etc. and how the choices that we make can impact those around us, causing a ripple effect. It's certainly not a movie for everyone, and definitely not one for young children. If you don't mind musicals, and you're a viewer who enjoys moral stories, then ""Into The Woods"" is worth having. I wouldn't hail it as the best I've ever seen, but I don't regret the purchase. I found myself hanging on to every line and every lyric until I found the true message behind this odd tale.

6862319,1,B00Q7WBGHG,"I was very disappointed by this film and I regret that I watched it, as it was a waste of time and money. Below, more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.

Adapted from a succesful Broadway musical this film combines and re-tells in a very different way classical fairy tales ""Little Red Riding Hood"", ""Cinderella"", ""Jack and the Beanstalk"", and ""Rapunzel"". The heroes from all the four stories meet and interact with considerable help from a witch (Meryl Streep), a baker (James Corden) and his wife (Emily Blunt), who are the central characters in the whole story.

The initial idea was of course great, but the execution was very, very poor indeed. Most of the story is really boring and the second half of it is simply nonsensical. Almost all characters are more or less unpleasant and the one more or less honest guy is pale and hapless. Acting is wooden and uninspired, with even Meryl Streep going mostly through the motions, without real commitment. Only Johnny Depp (who plays the slightly paedophiliac Big Bad Wolf) put some effort in his acting, but his screentime is very, very limited, hardly more than a cameo. There are some unpleasant moments, with the worst of them SPOILER ALERT HERE! being the scene in which baker's wife becomes pregnant with child. Last but not least, most of the film is joyless, humourless (there is ONE and ONLY ONE good joke, delivered by the Prince Charming played by Chris Pine) and towards the end simply depressing.

This is supposedly a musical film but the songs are very, very poor and even worse, most of the actors cannot really sing and perform them badly. The WORST of them is the song executed (because definitely not performed) by two Princes Charming (the one from Cinderella played by Chris Pine and the one from Rapunzel played by Billy Magnussen) - in the cinema in which me and my wife watched this film, there was a lot of loud comments, surprised whispering and many bursts of unbelieving laughter at that moment, so awfully embarassing was this thing.

Even to stay until the end of this thing was an ordeal - at 124 minutes it is already a long thing, but it seemed much, much longer. For me and my wife this film really spoiled a large part of our date (and with our kids being still little we don't have so many of those). The only good thing about this film is that it is easy to forget... AVOID!!",1430352000,3,2374,4.618483412322274
6862320,1,B00Q7WBGHG,"HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT
I purchased the DVD based on the trailer.  I usually love musicals but I would put this in a class all it's own: horrible.  Based on the actors, I thought it would be great.

6862348,5,B00Q7WBGHG,"Stephen Sondheim's 1987 ""Into The Woods"" is perhaps his most commercial success and seemingly most accessible score. This is explainable due to the brilliance of James Lapine and the fact that all musical songs are written using familiar form: 32 bar songs with applause encouraging buttons. The entire first act, though heavily foreshadowed and brilliant, leads the audience off the path toward each pretty flower. From a theoretical standpoint, Sondheim writes this score so that it mirrors the theme of the show. The second act strays from these precise rules but continues to utilize solidly established character motifs and-in strong Sondheim style-begins to limit when the audience may applaud or audibly react.
  The opening number for ""Into The Woods"" is unparalleled in theatre history. During it's twenty minute span every element, character and conflict is presented. Each character is given a simple motif which is developed and merged as the show progresses and the characters begin to deepen. The theme Sol doe re ti la doe re ti sol begins as Rapunzles vocalize but soon begins to find itself connected to all characters who experience unrequited love. It is the accompaniment for Jack's farewell to milky white. It is the melody the witch sings in ""Stay With Me"" as the parent who wishes to protect her child. The two princes sing it in both versions of ""Agony"" first for Cinderella and Rapunzel and later for Snow White and Sleeping Beauty. (The two versions of ""Agony"" are musically identical-something Sondheim has never done elsewhere-because it suits the two characters. They are the only ones who begin and remain shallow. ""I was raised to be charming, not sincere."") even the payment of the five beans to Jack uses Rapunzel's theme. ""Giants In The Sky"" uses this motif so that by the end of act one, this motif subtly represents the relationship between parent and child, another misunderstood love.
  The parents-or would be parents-sing motifs that are stepwise, repetitive and careful.  Repeated rhythmic patterns that begin with Jack's Mother, is carried through with Cinderella's Mother, Stepmother and is firmly established by The Baker and His Wife. (""If you know what you want..."") until we reach fruition by juxtaposing the two motifs in ""No More"" where The Baker and The Mysterious Man literally sing as a mirror on the lyric, ""Like father like son."" For the first time, a parent is thinking in a new way and the intervals are wider; the range is an octave and a half, yet the the very brave decision of ""no more"" at the end, is a tentative half step, ending over a hollow, basic triad.
  ""No One Is Alone"" is the most misunderstood song in the history of musical theatre. Many mistake it for a comfort lullaby where in fact it is a warning. It warns that it's impossible to protect against everything while the best chance for survival is to work together. (""No one acts alone: careful! No one acts alone."" ) The ""Children Will Listen"" theme is suggested carefully through this-very carefully, since we've heard it twice before in different contexts- and the children's themes ease more toward the adult themes.
  ""Children Will Listen"" comes close to an anthem though due to it's cut and paste it doesn't do so. Still, the lyrics are brilliant and even shadow Hammerstein's ""You've Got To Be Carefully Taught"". But for the first time in the show, we depart from neatly measured even beats though the Rapunzel theme reappears in the accompaniment played by flute above all else, as a reminder of where we began.
  The only guarantee in life is that we will always have to face new challenges and will subsequently have to face it: to return to the woods. And this is what the score does. Sondheim returns to his contrapuntal warning of how to stay on track and then the entire company repeats the ""Into The Woods"" theme. There's not a wasted second, and with the perception of human nature the very last lyric is the major second which began the show as Cinderella sings, ""I wish!""
  To analyze this entire score is worthy of a dissertation but it's my hope that this review will cause you to look carefully. As brilliant as Sondheim's other scores are, ""Into The Woods"" is perhaps his most craftily and through-composed piece. It is in this piece that his writing ethos is most apparent: Less is more; content dictates form; God is in the details.",1430265600,2,4382,4.857908847184986

6862420,2,B00Q7WBGHG,"wouldn't buy it. the acting from all the experienced actresses/actors was solid. it's like star parents wanted to put the feeling of anxiety of parenting and used that, or at least, that was the way I interpreted it Meryl Streep and Johnny Depp's motivation for taking their parts or perhaps they just wanted to work with the other actresses/actors or the other artists. Jack's experience rang very true as representative for impoverished kids worldwide forced into life's difficulties by stressed parents. The big bad wolf, and the twisted witch harming razpunzel though justifying her choices by saying she's protecting her, lots of true motivations that get twisted and I can see why actresses/actors would be interested, but musicals are a tough sell for the audience, or musicals in this style. changed it up abit by including minority background actresses/actors which was nice, angelie jolie did that in her last big role. hollywood, wow. takes these big huge stars to get minority character as even background characters in these type of fairytale fillms, as if minorities weren't alive back in the day, when it's scientifically accepted that we're all descended from an african eve and adam. we've certainly got a long, long, long way to go to get a more balanced racial representation in film. maybe we'll actually make it within the next 1,000 years. institutions are incredibly slow and just won't do anything that help others, apparently, without being forced into it (or at least that's my take on Hollywood; maybe I'm wrong - sure would like to be, on this topic). sometimes I wonder how we make any progress at all. anyway, sorry, off topic. the film didn't suck but I don't see it being a hit with many. worth a watch for the acting. 2 and a half stars.",1429920000,,1770,4.883720930232558

Then, it comes to a nice conclusion at the castle with a typical happily ever after marriage.....huh, what....is....this....more to the story?  Wait, she suddenly cheats and dies?  Huh, he cheats with her....no way?  What?  Why does the witch do that?  Wait, now she wants to clean house for some random nobody just cause she got dumped?  It makes NO sense.  Seriously folks, I know you won't stop because your curiosity will keep you going, but once you finish this thing, you'll agree that it was good up till the castle/marriage scene, then it became just plain dumb.

I loved the score in Sweeney Todd but the music in this film I found to be quite unimaginative. Not a single song stood out. I can't pinpoint exactly why the movie was so bad but I struggled to get through it. I did like how so many different fairy tale characters were tied together in a single movie but I felt slapped in the face by the liberties the writers took with certain characters. I don't want to tell exactly what happened so as not to spoil parts of the plot but I feel that some serious character assassinations occurred. The end, in particular, felt hurried and very unsatisfying. I had so wanted to enjoy this movie but all in all, it left a bad taste in my mouth.",1429833600,,804,4.187096774193549

The acting and singing are wonderful but for most of the movie the sets in the woods have a variety of blues.  Blue is a color I associate with calmness or sleepiness.

However, I did not realize the entire story was in song.  There would be maybe one or two sentences of regular dialogue then back to singing the story.

6862487,5,B00Q7WBGHG,"Stephen Sondheim's clever, witty and winsome INTO THE WOODS has moved from 1987 Broadway theater to the big screen and it is a successful transition. Few thought the Sondheim/James Lapine piece would make it on film because it is, after all, a musical - a piece that is almost completely sung, with characters who are from fairytales - a category that can hardly compete with the current gluttonous appetite for loud killer action and potty mouth sexual innuendoes and it is not derived from a Marvel comic book.

But for those who enjoy theatre, well-composed music, opera and operetta this is a richly rewarding experience. INTO THE WOODS s a modern twist on the beloved Brothers Grimm fairy tales in a musical format that follows the classic tales of Cinderella, Little Red Riding Hood, Jack and the Beanstalk, and Rapunzel-all tied together by an original story involving a baker and his wife, their wish to begin a family and their interaction with the witch who has put a curse on them. The cat is outstanding singing their own roles as opposed to having them produced off camera by professional singers. Meryl Streep as the Witch is not only a beautifully developed character but she sings very well indeed. The same can be said for Emily Blunt, James Corden (he IS talented), Anna Kendrick, Daniel Huttlestone (well remembered for his Gavroche in Les Mis&eacute;rables), Christine Baranski, Tracey Ullman, Johnny Depp (always willing to take chances and stretch his abilities), the underused Billy Magnussen, Lilla Crawford, and Chris Pine (as the Prince, with a grossly out of character au courant 5 o'clock shadow beard that breaks the mood of fairytales)

It is a show that either your like or you hate - depending on sensitivity to this medium. But it is so nice to see something creative on the big screen that doesn't depend on body count and car explosions and breasts to maintain the audiences attention. The last part of the story gets a bit Hallmarky, but even that is in keeping with the happily ever after flow of Sondheim's little jewel. Grady Harp, April 15",1429747200,2,2079,4.853521126760564

6862545,5,B00Q7WBGHG,"Gene Kelly was once asked why musicals were no longer a staple of modern movies and he said something to the effect that no one knows how to make them anymore. (This was a short time after he appeared in Xanadu. Today, only a precious few know how to do it: the producers and director of Into the Woods.

This is as close as any contemporary movie has come to making a musical that most audiences can seethe caveat being that Into the Woods is a mature twist on fairy tale characters and not for the purist or the very young. Disney toned down the sequences with Red Riding Hood and the Wolf as well as the Bakers Wife and Prince Charming to the point that things are very obtuse.

That all said, Into the Woods has a lot of comedy, one of Sondheims most melodic scores and a brisk pace (kudos to director Rob Marshall for that). And to be fair to the subject matter, one can watch the network series Once Upon a Time and see the evil Queen pulling hearts out of her victims and a naked-under-the-sheets Show White and Prince Charming interrupted in the middle of, as my dad used to call it, spoo-ja-doo, only to exuberantly resume after their company leaves.

A lot of attention has been awarded to the biggest stars of the film, so lets focus on others who also deliver remarkable performancesno mean feat in a musical film, especially one with the challenging music and lyric structure of Sondheim.

James Corden is the emotional center of the film and the character with whom the audience most connects; Christine Baranski makes every syllable and gesture count as always as one of the big screens best evil Stepmothers and Tracey Ullmann brings superb comic timing to a somewhat thankless role (she and Baranski could have played any number of roles in this musical). As one of the stepsisters, the astonishing Tammy Blanchard makes one forget she also played Karen Carpenter and Judy Garland. Even Hagrids girlfriend turns up as the Giants Wife.

Once again, a modestly-budgeted movie proves that less money and tight time frames (and less indulegence) can result in fine, profitable films. The art direction and costuming has a painterly quality, very much as if it came from an Arthur Rackham book.

What Into the Woods is not is cozy and comfy. Yes, there are songs like No One is Alone that offer solace and reassurance, its almost an anti-fairy tale in the familiar sense (the original fairy tales were quite dark). Many, many messages flow out of the lyrics: Life can be unpleasant you should know, Im not good, Im not nice, Im just right and Nice doesnt always mean good.

The Blu-ray contains an audio commentary (thank you!) and several interesting behind-the-scenes vignettes, making this a fine package, especially when combined with the deluxe edition of the soundtrack (with all the songs and music).",1429574400,2,2819,4.694331983805668

I knew it was supposed to comedic so it was as expected, but I didn't tell my mum and she thought it was a waste until I told her it was supposed to be a comedy about half way through and her reaction; ""Well that explains the terrible acting at least""

The plot is exactly what you would expect, fairy tale characters doing dumb things that don't make sense in the real world. They could have very easily had this not be a musical and it would have been a bit better. I didn't really understand Johnny Depp's portrayal of the wolf. He seemed less sinister wolf and more child molester in his one (and only) scene. Meryl Streep did a good job playing the crone but, as with every other character, it was highly overacted.

Paid $10, might watch it again in about 5 years, but I feel very sorry for anyone who paid full price ($25 when first released!?) or had the misfortune of paying to see it in theatres.",1429574400,2,979,4.258064516129032

6862570,5,B00Q7WBGHG,"ANIMATED films make us forget just how dark Grimms original stories are. Into the Woods reminds us.

That Walt Disney Studios leaps into the fairy tale musical by composer/lyricist Stephen Sondheim and writer James Lapine comes as no surprise. That they embrace its more tragic concepts is thrilling. Producer/director Rob Marshall (Chicago, 2011)and producer John DeLuca make Woods relevant and accessible to a new generation.

Who knew Emily Blunt (Bakers Wife) and James Corden (Baker) could sing so well and command the scene as the primary leads? Johnny Depp wowed us in Sondheims Sweeny Todd (2007); here hes Red Riding Hoods Wolf in a Tex Avery inspired zoot suit. But its Chris Pine  Captain Kirk of J.J. Abrams Star Trek reboot  who steals every scene hes in as Cinderellas Prince. Agony, the duet he shares with Billy Magnussen (Rapunzels Prince) is a show stopper.

Then theres Meryl Streep. She earned Oscar and Golden Globe nominations for her turn as the Witch. What a powerhouse she is, transforming from crone to beauty, leaping and whirling as she delivers Sondheims lyrics, gliding from demand to tenderness to stinging observation without pause. (Breathing is not an option in Sondheim.)

Fairy tales evolved as cautionary tales, she tells us in the bonus feature, Theres Something About the Woods. Red Riding Hoods story warns children not to talk to strangers. Woods heightens the complexity of relationships, the desire for things just beyond our reach, and their consequences.

The Woods is a metaphor for many things in life. Your wishes are there, your dreams, your hopes. But also your fears, Marshall says.

We see that play out when the giants arrive in the story, seeking what was stolen from them. They appear as threatening shadows in Disneys high-def transfer causing destruction and death as they smash their way across the land. It is a grand contrast to the films rich color, depth and detail. Into the Woods debuted on Broadway in 1987, where the giants destruction happened offstage. Updated for the film, they represent sudden, violent catastrophe: 9/11, mass murder, planes driven into mountain sides. It is not what we expect in a Disney fairy tale, but anticipate in a parable by Sondheim.

Woods blends a variety of stories, Jack in the Beanstalk, Cinderella, Rapunzel and Red Riding Hood. Each have a quest they hope will improve their life. The Woods are their dreamscape with its mix of redwoods, willows and birch, wildflowers, tar pits and ropy vines. Music enhances the magical aspect. When words aren't enough to convey emotion, there are songs, and Disneys DTS-HD Master Audio 7.1 surround track delivers. More opera than musical, voices beguile, whisper, threaten and shriek, floating and bouncing throughout the room, blending with windblown leaves and birdsong.

Extras enhance the Blu-ray experience beginning with commentary from Marshall and DeLuca, who talk about their inspirations, casting, editing and cinematography. We learn Jack, of Beanstalk fame, was usually played by an adult in stage productions. Marshall was adamant that the childrens characters be played by children in the film. This is further explored in The Cast as Good as Gold.

Deeper into the Woods is a four-part, 30-minute documentary: From Stage to Screen, The Magic of the Woods, Designing the Woods (Dennis Gassner and Anna Pinnock were Oscar nominated for Best Achievement in Production Design) and The Costumes of the Woods, where Colleen Atwood, also Oscar nominated, describes how she created specific styles for each story then brought them together for a complete vision. Two Music & Lyrics options allow us to watch the film with on-screen lyrics or view individual songs, again, with lyrics. Streep Sings Sondheim: Shell Be Back is a deleted song  ironically written for the film.

Into the Woods is not for everyone. It is so deliberately unsettling! Were not supposed to feel sorry for the Witch; Little Red is not a brat; Cinderella and Charming are supposed to live happily ever after. Still, those who love a challenge will love this journey.

I am a huge Bernadette Peters fan and was initially unhappy to see that she hadn't been cast in the witches role, but Ms. Streepe has stepped up and delivered a truly amazing performance. I did miss the Prince's reprise of ""Agony""...but at the same time was glad to see that Rapunzel was able to keep her happy ever after with her prince ( and not get killed by the woman giant as she did in the original musical)...as some of us do start out with rough beginnings, but then are able to find some bit of happiness in this world.",1429574400,,825,4.4635761589403975

6862592,4,B00Q7WBGHG,"Deep in the recesses of our imaginations live the many fairy tales that come to life in this wonderful adaptation that entwines nearly all of them together.  With the gamut of emotions, far into the woods where fairy tales reside, each unfolds on top of another so that the stories are all woven together.  The music is powerful, especially No One is Really Alone.  My only reservation was that it seemed a little longer than it needed to be, but a worthwhile evening of entertainment.  Note:  This is a musical!",1429488000,,512,4.644444444444445
6862593,2,B00Q7WBGHG,"What in the heck were they thinking???  So many people die in this what-was-touted-as-a-family-film, that my kids were disgusted.  Spoiler Alert!

Why did the prince marry Cinderella if he cheats on her the same day as their wedding?  Why did the baker's wife celebrate cheating on her husband when they just had a child together?  Why did the witch so oddly die after one last song?  And why was this even a musical?

I understand folks try and try again to revive musicals, but they really don't know how to write a good one these days.  They always come up short.  If you want to make another musical, find a way to bring back Astaire, Rosemary Clooney, old blue eyes Crosby, Gene Kelly, and turn back time on Debbie Reynolds, and then you've got yourself a true musical.  Otherwise, make like Frozen and ""let it go.""",1429488000,,820,4.554794520547945

That section was just so jarring.  A fanatical devotee of the Bernadette Peters Broadway performance, I was prepared to hate this, but the choices they made make sense, even though losing any of Sondheim's music is a loss.  The whole thing is coherent, fun, and James Corden is wonderful, good enough to make up (almost) for the loss of the Narrator.

The story is great until the middle of the play, then it takes a turn for the worse. All of the plot lines collide to create a disastrous wreck. At the end of the story you wonder why you stuck around. It would have been better to walk out half way through but the worst thing about the musical is the mind numbing musical score. Sondheim composes an unimaginative score. The lyrics are brilliant but the music itself is like taking a trip to the dentist. It relies almost entirely of droning rhythmic passages void of any lyrical moments. There are a few exceptions to this eg. ""Agony"" and ""No one is alone"" but the rest of the play is 2 hours of filler music that drills into your head yet nothing sticks because there are no melodic passages that you would want to sing to. It is like walking down the street and just making something up as you sing/talk to your friend for 2 hours. The movie is great, the music is annoying.",1429315200,,1078,4.422110552763819

6862687,4,B00Q7WBGHG,"Perhaps it's my fault for not knowing all the Broadway hit shows from the 1970s/1980s, but as this was one of them, I was a bit surprised with the music and melodic structure itself.  During the well done acting and singing, done in this very unusual mash up and intertwining of several fairy tales.  I found myself more and more wondering why this music I've never heard before sounded so familiar.  Then I looked it up and discovered that the great Sondheim wrote this and what I was hearing were nearly the same melodies and harmonic structure of one of his other same time on Broadway other musicians...Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street.  As much as I respect all this man had accomplished in his 50+ years composing great music for Broadway as well as TV, and movies.  It did bother me a bit that it sounded musically so much alike auto the point I could hum the melody to Into The Woods without ever seeing it before based on my intimate knowledge of Sweeney Todd's musical score.  Some similarity is understandable as we all are human and even the greatest of composers like certain passages, or turns of phrase that stick with them and make their signature sound.  But wow, was this almost a complete rip off of his 1979 score of Sweeney Todd.  According to the chonology of Sonheim I just looked up to write this review correctly.  into The Woods didn't come out u til nearly a decade later in 1987. So I guess after writing so many great scores I presume it's possible to forget all that had been written before.  Although as a classically trained professional musician and composer starting at age 4 myself, I remember every passage I've ever written and can't imagine how a famous and successful score such and Sweeney Todd could be forgotten in any even minor bit when composing a new score for a totally different musical?  Yet, there ya have it.  If you liked the music of Sweeney Todd or liked the music of this, the I suggest you complete the set and perhaps watch or buy the other if not already seen both.",1429228800,,2037,4.520435967302452

Merryl  Streep overacts,  and postures, and flings herself about -- all very mannered, ""actorly"" and affected.  You never lose sight of the fact that this is Meryl Streep, ""acting"" -- one feels manipulated by her deployment of acting technique and by the overall assumption that, being Meryl, this dreadful performance just has to be labelled ""a marvellous characterization"" -- which was what many a critic opined.  However,  the party I was with decided afterwards that watching her felt as if we were caught in a formal dinner event with assigned seating at a table with a crazy awful unhinged dramatic celebrity that we all have to pretend to love when you really just want to get away.  We clapped and cheered after her final big exit number -- because, finally, she was out of the picture.

The worst however was Johnny Depp, channelling pedophilia.  His creepy stalking of  ""little red riding hood"" was followed by his child victim singing a song about how she is experiencing  confusing ""feelings"" from her encounter with him;  this is over the line of decency and the adults involved in this sequence should be ashamed of themselves -- unless, of course, they were deliberately going for ""edge"" and think pedophilic stalking by a creepy adult male of a prepubescent child (""look at her sweet flesh"")  is fun entertainment.  If this was the intent, then they are despoiling their own art,not to mention the Disney legacy.  And, to top it all off, it was hinted that little red riding hood has an eating disorder.  This is funny also?

Walt Disney would fire the lot of them.  Do not go to this movie, it is awful and at times downright, if subtly, vile.",1429228800,6,1897,4.746177370030581

6862710,5,B00Q7WBGHG,"It looks like the fact that Into the Woods is a musical took some people unawares. The premise of the plot also seems to be a point of contention for others, citing too many different stories and unhappy endings. If you can accept these things then you may enjoy Into the Woods if you aren't familiar with it. We all know what happened to Bambi's mommy and that was a Disney movie too. Some of the details also reflect the original stories more accurately. The changes from the stage production are probably meant to make a good movie and appeal to a broader audience without offending. You can get the gist of everything, but it also sounds like the theatre buffs are disappointed. The show in general is very clever and captivating despite being compromised of familiar ones. I missed the missing Agony part two. It presents an interesting message too, though I suppose people take what they want from it. The world may be fraught with danger, but I think that's the risk we all have to take, as children inevitably grow up and come down from their towers.
The acting and singing were actually pretty good which was a nice surprise. Though while watching Agony I just couldn't figure out what I was being reminded of - my first thought was '80s George Michael, then I realized ... Sigfried and Roy. I was waiting for the white tigers. And Meryl Streep, she didn't do badly at all (oh right, Mama Mia). I enjoyed Anna Kendrick's voice quite a bit, and to find something negative to say, a bit more than her acting. It was a little too modern-teenage-girl with the head bobbing and pithy language. The children were good, but I think Red was channeling the Broadway cast soundtrack and Jack had a touch of something in there with his accent. Both kids showed exceptional talent and poise. It's a great story if you're not familiar with it, and if you like it you might want to explore other cast productions or recordings. Nice to see Mr. Depp as well.",1429142400,,1952,4.548295454545454

6862726,4,B00Q7WBGHG,"People who bash ""Into the Woods"" almost invariably fall into two categories (and yes, this includes professional film critics): 1) they hate the second half of the story and want it to end at ""happily ever after,"" and 2) they hate the score.  To which I respond: if you don't do your homework, don't complain!  The point of ""Into the Woods"" is what happens AFTER ""happily ever after""--as the lyrics say, ""There are always wolves, there are always spells, there always woods where a giant dwells.""  (The reprise, cut from the film, might also have helped underline the theme: ""Into the woods, it's always when/you think at last you're through and then/into the woods you go again/to take another journey."")  Not insignificantly has the show been taken a metaphor for AIDS (as people begin to die), or even a post-September 11th world; not everything it going to tie up with a happy bow.  Bad things happen to good people.  People who do things ""right"" still don't get what they deserve.  And ""you can't just wish, you have to think.""  If a parent shows this to a child under the age of 8, of course there are going to be questions about loss, infidelity, betrayal, what is the ""right"" thing to do; if you want clear-cut, black-and-white moral simplicity, show Disney's originals.  As for the score: it's Sondheim, people.  Some of the songs are going to be lyrically brilliant, while seeming musically atonal, repetitive, etc.  (If you want ""bouncy"" melodies, go rent ""Annie."")  The only thing some of the naysayers have mentioned which is true is that the show isn't as bitingly funny as the original, and some of the trimming has softened a couple plot points (Jack's mother's death, Rapunzel's fate) and resulted in the loss of the ""Agony"" reprise.  But good news--the original Broadway version is on DVD as well, as can be rented any time you want to do a side-by-side comparison.  The key question is, on it's OWN TERMS--as one of the first ""mashup/revisionist"" musicals, existing as it does in the bleak times in which we live--is ""Into the Woods"" a success?  Is it sumptuously shot and scored, brilliantly cast (Pine, Kendrick, Streep, Corden, Crawford)?  Is it faithful (enough) to the source material?  Does it provoke, challenge, stimulate, and ask hard questions about parents and children, right and wrong, morality and mortality, etc?  Can you hum or whistle at least half of the tunes, and do the lyrics bite and provoke rather than gently reassure?  On all of those counts, ""Into the Woods' is a major success, and easily the most ambitious (and best-realized of those ambitions) musical probably since ""Dreamgirls.""",1429142400,2,2630,4.882882882882883

And Meryl Streep has a unique singing voice that I for one really like hearing. It may seem silly but i'm the person always looks for the moral in every story. to me this one is about taking responsibility for your choices and actions and ""Grey Area"" Which I really like. Its original and to me suitable lesson for the preteen ages.

No one's really good no one's really bad just NICE"" a quote from one of the songs. I would agree with the PG rating it includes some topics that would make the much younger children ask why? like a man kissing a married woman that's not his wife.(just kissing I promise) to a father making the choice weather or not to leave his motherless newborn or not because he's afraid to be a terrible father.... It doesn't leave with the happiest of endings like were used to when it comes to these fairy tales we've come to love but it is a good one and is  definitely suited to the moral of the movie.

6862755,2,B00Q7WBGHG,"The movie ""Into the Woods"" was great with some of the new songs, but not so good with the overall plot. The screen writers obviously had to deal with things that didn't end happily ever after, but they shouldn't have made it mandatory in a Disney movie. Of course, various movies in the past seemed to challenge the notion of happily ever after, like Hook and Pocahontas, but come on. People are used to happy endings without so many plot twists, and this, in contrast to (***SPOILER ALERT***) Emily Blunt's onscreen death and Anna Kendrick's unhappy marriage feelings (***End SPOILER***). Frozen was good, even without the ""prince marries the princess"" storyline. Coming from a moderately conservative upbringing, I suppose I could accept some modern family values with not-so-perfect unions (just look at some of the books on sale, either online or even at a real store, for ideas). Maybe the modern family isn't as simple as families in the 1980s and 90s, but even then, people made whatever union they had into a livable union. So, remember that anything is possible when you enter the woods, is what I got from the movie.

I should point out that I LOVE musicals and fairy tales, especially the darker ones. So this is right up my alley. And, boy did it deliver! I've never seen or heard anything from the original musical it's based on, so I can't say how faithful it was to the source material, but I loved it. It was dark and creepy and hilarious and touching all at once. This is not a movie for children, at least not young children. It's darker and more adult than the average Disney movie. Though, most of the death and scariness is subtle or happens off screen, it is definitely there. The stories are closer to the Grimm version than the Disney ones (pecking out eyes, cutting off toes, that sort of thing). The performances from the actors are wonderful. Meryl Streep really shines as the witch. I would strongly recommend this to any lover of musicals, Grimm fairy tales, or darker Disney films.",1428883200,,981,4.4860335195530725

6862872,2,B00Q7WBGHG,"Maybe I am biased towards stage musicals turned feature films, but there is a reason why these two have distinctly different formats. What might work on a stage doesn't necessarily have to work on screen. Keep in mind that this one is the adaptation of a stage musical, and has nothing to do with original stories. By sticking to close to the format, the movie becomes a disjointed mess of cameos, and not even the immense talent of the cast can save it. Heavy stage make up doesn't help, and ultimately it even fails to entertain. There are brief moments of humor that might make you laugh, and singing is good, but none of it amounts to much. Safe to skip and choose some other fairy tale adaptation for those who love that, or, if you have a chance, go see this on stage. I have the feeling even mediocre stage production would work much better. Btw, there is a recording of one available on Amazon.",1428710400,,902,4.4397590361445785

Or at least wait till you can watch it for free. We actually stopped watching this right after the ""Big Bad Wolf"" (Johnny Deep) made my wife and my stomach turn. I am a big Deep fan but, ""Wow"" This was as bad as Crybaby and Willy Wonka combined. But then we restarted the film a day later in case it was just a fluke and the movie might get better. It did not improve at all. Which is sad because the reviews of the stage performance were stellar. I give ""Into the woods"" a ""D+"". because at times I was entertained.

My tastes in movies range from silent films to big CGI extravaganzas, and plenty of Broadway musicals in between, but I'm sorry, this one stinks. I love Meryl Streep, but even she can't make this murky clunker come alive. None of the musical numbers strike a chord within, none of the songs are memorable, and they really aren't songs, they're more like chants. I won't dispute that the acting and plot are probably better on stage, but you won't leave any auditorium humming or whistling tunes...they don't qualify as such. What a waste.

So this is a twist on fairy tales... Big deal. Like it's never been done before? Rocky and Bullwinkle's ""Fractured Fairy Tales"" had so much more to offer. If you think ""dark"" is edgy, and endless hopping around, falling down, and yakity-yak is artistic, then this is your film.

The movie isn't great, that much is disappointingly true but some complaints about this movie makes me want to ask these people what exactly they were expecting. People such as those complaining about there being too much singing...in a musical, those blaming Disney for the songs and story (it was a Broadway musical before Disney adapted it into a movie), and those complaining that it wasn't ""Disney"" enough which I guess means that they thought it wasn't the watered down child friendly versions of fairytales that they were expecting from a Disney movie. Obviously these people have never read the original versions of any fairytale because none of them are really child friendly. We all have the right to proffer our opinions but I would just like to see more informed reviews from people otherwise it is just a waste of everyone's time. To be fair though, this movie is missing that special ""something"" that the original play had. It was ok but just ok, nothing that would really stay with you, in other words it was forgettable (unfortunately).",1428537600,3,1137,4.8061224489795915

6862954,2,B00Q7WBGHG,"Have you ever wondered what would happen if you took all of the Disney stories and smashed them into one another until they didn't really have any identity anymore but took on this vague redundancy and became, for lack of a better word, stupid?  I personally have never wondered this.  I never wanted to wonder this.  Why would anyone wonder this?  Now, I cant speak for Sondheim, who penned the famed musical, but this preposterous film adaptation, penned by James Lapine and directed by that hack known as Rob Marshall is so void of texture that it feels grossly underdeveloped, lazy and pointless.

The more I think about what this could have been and what it turned out to be the more I start to seethe at the mouth.

You see, Disney has a special place in my heart.  So do Broadway musicals.  So do dark, twisted incarnations of what we think we know and love.  So, seeing our Disney heroines thrust into a dark and twisted fantasy wrapped in music that swells from the girth of all things Les Miserables was something I was, without question, looking forward to.  Into the Woods was one of the films I personally could not wait to set my eyes on.  I expected something grand, something provoking, something challenging, something memorable.  What I got was something that felt too withdrawn, withered almost, underdeveloped, not reaching the heights it was setting for itself and, sadly, forgettable.

All that potential was squandered, and it makes me sick to my stomach.

I have not seen the stage musical, so I cannot compare, although Ive read about some of the family friendly changes that were made to this production, and so I can say that this film does not represent what Sondheim originally intended.  What baffles me the most about this is the fact that they went to such great lengths to clean this up for families and yet they still left in a sizable amount of innuendo that makes me question the direction they wanted to take this.  If they were going to try and keep Sondheims darker vision intact, why not go all the way and actually shoot for at least a PG-13 rating, kill off the characters you needed to and keep his vision alive?  Why alter it just so much but not enough to the point where it finds itself somewhere in the middle of what it was and what you wanted it to be and now it has no identity and is just awkward and uncomfortable?

And why is this film so dungy and dull, visually?  Why is everything so dark and unfortunate?  I understand that this is a darker tale, a more depressing one, but even Les Miserables was beautiful to look at.  Instead of capitalizing on the general lavish stylings of Disney productions, this minimalist approach makes everything feel so ugly and dull.

And don't even get me started on the story.  This is what happens when you try too hard to mash everything together but lack the ability to edit and make it all flow.  The base storyline (about finding items to feed to a cow to reverse a spell) makes no sense and feels so preposterous it cant be a real story.  Like, who would make this up?  Who thinks this sounds even remotely interesting and not in the slightest absolutely silly?

The cast is good, though, for the most part.  They don't have a whole lot to do, but most of them make the most of what they do have.  James Corden grounds the film, but hes also saddled with a lifeless character.  Anna Kendrick sings beautifully, but does nothing else.  Meryl Streep is all sorts of over the top, but she sells her main moments (except for that rap, which was awful).  Emily Blunt is the lifeblood of the film and is the sole MVP, but even her character feels skeletal, which is sad since the character itself SHOULD have filled the screen.

Pedophile Johnny Depp is almost as creepy as regular Johnny Depp and was, beyond a shadow of a doubt, the worst thing about this movie.

But, its not really a knock to be the worst thing in a movie that is just full of nothing special, so its all kind of the worst thing if you really think about it.  Nothing really works here.  Its a lot of the same thing over and over with no real arc worth investing in, and when all is said and done the central theme about children listening and growing and parents and adults being careful how they raise those children never comes across except for in the words of a song, which is nicely sung but fails to make an impact.",1428537600,2,4382,4.467924528301887

Plus Johnny Depp is in it. I also liked that they kind of showed what really happens after ""happily ever after"". The only reasons I gave this movie 4 stars is because of the singing. Way too much of it. I know that it's a musical, but they didn't have to sing quite that much, and it was a really long movie. Watch when you have nothing else to do. I wouldn't let really young kids go see this, it could be too dark for them. But, a good movie. Buy it and decide for yourself.",1428537600,,637,3.9076923076923076

The rest of the cast clearly gave all they had to give, and truly, they did quite well. But no genius acting (not even Meryl's) can save poor writing, and the writing for this one was just rank. You can ""special effect"" a piece to death but, as we learned from the genuinely awful ""Wag The Dog,"" the best actors in the world giving it all they have cannot save an absolutely awful movie.

And this one goes right next to ""Wag The Dog.""

There is no sense of timing and interplay with the characters. It seems the actors fling out lines that fall flat and just lie there lifeless and rotting. Interactions make no sense as a result  Was it poor directing?  Or is it just a continuation of Disney's propensity to acquire a wonderful story and turn it into something nearly unrecognizable and far inferior to the original?  Key scenes are just gone. Character's fates are changed.....ugh! I'd recommend that instead of watching this, turn to the Original Broadway production starring Bernadette Peters as the witch.

6862992,1,B00Q7WBGHG,"... or being tied in a chair and forced to a listen to a speech by Ted Cruz or Marco Rubio would have been less traumatizing!

I ADORE musicals. I ADORE Meryl Streep. I adore movies that most people hate. I adore wacky quirky goofy weird  movies. I support the ""little films"" that no one's ever heard of and has little chance of success. But INTO THE WOODS is a horror film that put a gun to the heads of top notch acting talent, walked them to the edge of a cliff, and then hurled them over the edge to plunge to their death in a bloody messy SPLAT. I was in complete shock to discover that this eardrum-shattering, amateurish train wreck was by Stephen Sondheim.

To give a note of credit, the sets/locations were stunningly gorgeous, Meryl Streep sings a very beautifully touching song which I believe is called ""Stay With Me"" or something (which could have brought a tear to me eye if I wasn't still stunned by the horribleness of the rest of the film), and the two prince brothers sing a really good song together - at least, by the time the song was over and I figured out what they were singing about I thought it was good.

The rest was so horribly painful that I and my family watched with our jaws dropped. We were speechless. Every moment we were waiting for the story to go somewhere, but all we got was death and adultery and unfinished plots with no reason or rhyme. Don't bother buying this movie. It would be much easier if you just took out a $20 bill and set it on fire.

6862999,2,B00Q7WBGHG,"Bizarre and strangely inappropriate/creepy at times (for example, the lyrical dialogue with ""Wolf Man"" played by Johnny Depp regarding an adolescent girl has way too much sexual connotation to it not to mention her subsequent version of events as explained to the Baker - VERY CREEPY and UNCOMFORTABLE). The singing and repetitive lyrical lines begin very tedious, drawn out and tiresome and have you wondering early on how you are ever going to make it through the entire film. Then the brilliance of Meryl Streep comes to the rescue as her lyrical dialogue is engaging, credible and highly entertaining in every instance. The emotion and empathy she is able to draw from you despite her deep seeded wickedness is perplexing - particularly during the sequence when she is pleading with Rapunzel to ""stay with me"" despite the known outcome in that fairy tale story line. Anna Kendrick is the most unlikely Cinderella you could possibly cast but she is solid in her role and is strangely fitting with the bizarre adaptation which is this film. Still, some of the lyrical sequences are creative, clever, catchy and alot of fun (the shoes at the steps of the castle and ""then it's your fault"" later in the woods instantly come to mind). One of those films you wonder how you made it all the way through (if you do!) and leaves you asking ""what the heck was that?""",1428451200,,1360,4.766949152542373

While the actors and actresses did put forth reasonable effort, the quality of the vocal performances were hampered by a near universal case of tone deafness.

6863094,4,B00Q7WBGHG,"I enjoyed the film and would actually give it a 4 1/2 but that's not available.  Others have written about other things, so let me just focus on one thing.  Meryl Streep is of course our greatest actress or perhaps tied with someone I'm not remembering.  What stood out in this movie is that during the musical numbers, Meryl not only hits notes I've never heard her hit so well (and we know she can sing), but she also continues to act during the entire song.  If you know musicals, there's often some acting, but then the singing starts and it's just a musical performance.  But Meryl brings the full character into the songs, and we know what she is feeling and even some of her twisted takes on things.  This may actually be one of her best performances, but they don't give Oscars to people singing in musicals any more.  But she deserved the nomination.

This performance alone elevates this movie to must-see.  Others like Anna Kendrick and Johnny Depp in his small role and on thorough the cast are all good, each brings something to the plate, and the singing has more Broadway-quality voices than, say, Les Miserables had.  Everyone is good.  But with Meryl, you get all that makes Meryl a cut above the rest.  I don't think anyone in the cast would be insulted by 2nd billing.  They have to know they're watching someone who is one-of-a-kind.",1428364800,,1353,4.564315352697095

6863109,4,B00Q7WBGHG,"I would love to give this 5 stars. I laughed out loud many times, enjoyed it immensely and was very moved by many of the performances.
I think it's just that I loved the original stage play SO MUCH that I expected too much from this film. I understand things had to be cut for time reasons but the reprise of Agony was the funnies song in the play, yet left out of the movie along with Snow white and Sleeping Beauty.
  Johnny Depp was in this for his name, not his voice, but he was acceptable. Certainly no Robert Westenberg but then again, who could be?
I enjoyed Jack in the film better than the play especially his rendition of Giants in the Sky. I grew up with a crush on Danielle Ferland and was ready to hate whoever played little Red Riding Hood but she did an amazing job and I was very pleasantly surprised. Perfect deadpanning of the 2 best lines in the show. ""How uneasy i feel..."" and ""You'd look pretty foolish..."" Spot on. Same with Meryl Streep taking over for Ms. Peters. Much better than I expected. The baker and his wife were sort of made over for this film and i'm still not sure which pair i'd prefer. I've always loved Emily Blunt and she nailed this. The film seems to revolve around them more than the play but only slightly. Again, probably from time constraints. No offense to Kim Crosby but Anna Kendrick was the only one from the film WAY better than the original. She does have a stage background so it's not surprising.
  All in all, great movie. If you'd never seen the play, it has the pieces and feel to be a ""New Favorite Movie"".",1428278400,2,1565,4.294915254237288

6863142,2,B00Q7WBGHG,"This is the type of movie I hate to review.  It is a love it or hate it film.  Myself, I just didn't care for it.  I don't mind musicals, but this was so dragged out that at the one hour mark I felt like it had been on for two.  Of course they were telling five stories at once, Little Red Riding Hood, Cinderella, Rapunzel, Jack and the Beanstalk and the baker and his wife.  I guess I am one of the few that is not in awe of Meryl Streep, but I have to admit she was absolutely great in this film.  The two best roles were her as the Witch and Emily Blunt as the Baker's wife.  This is a dark film, but the Brothers Grimm told dark tales with mostly happing endings.  This was like here's the dark side and then we'll crush the happing endings and make it even darker.  Put in a little pass the buck, find someone to blame, philandering husband, cheating wife, kill off a spouse, dump a kid, feel guilty about killing someone who killed most of the people in the kingdom and wants to kill you and of course Johnny Depp's really creepy scene in the movie.  Whether you want to watch this film depends on your personal interests.  It is a dark adult fairytale and it is a musical, I mean a musical, not with musical numbers, but mostly musical so be prepared for that.  If you like this type of movie, you will really enjoy the film.  If you do not you might pass on this. -- Just know what to expect and you won't have anyone to blame if you make the wrong choice.",1428278400,3,1465,4.062717770034843

6863145,5,B00Q7WBGHG,it was a fun classic movie with all my favorite  characters in the movie. I also love the into the woods song because than it comes to be one great song. I love that it is also a musical I love to sing that's why when I  watching the movie in her room I would sing along to the songs. I think little kids would enjoy it because I know I did. I also like how the 2 prince were trying out do each other by say here princess is the best and all that was so funny.

Truthfully it should have ended when the Baker people got their kid or whatever, but they HAD to tie off the giant storyline )(no they didn't!) Don't recommend for small children, because I don't think they'll have the patience for it. It's too long with too much singing. Think Les Miserables for kids with the singing. It's too much, honestly! I love Meryl Streep but her character and her talent felt wasted. The whole movie wasn't paced correctly and the storyline was way too Broadway. This is a theatrical film, so I'm sorry, but more thought needs to be in it. It wasn't terrible. MIGHT watch again.

6863149,1,B00Q7WBGHG,Compared to other musicals this one was sorely lacking. Not for my tastes. Was very excited when I saw the trailer.,1428192000,4,115,4.523809523809524
6863150,5,B00Q7WBGHG,"Before I start, my feeling about this movie is that it is a gift to everyone who was unable to see a live performance of the show, whether on Broadway, one of the many revivals and touring companies, or even one of the varying amateur productions.  There is a film of a live performance available, if you are interested.  I mention a little about it below.

I've revised this review based on on a rather scathing comment I received from the initial review.  While I have known people in the industry, I have not be in touch with any of them for 15 years.  I do not now nor have I ever worked for a movie studio or been connected in any way with the Disney company.  I was trained as a professional musician, and having done poorly at that have made my professional mark as a systems programmer.

I've done something unusual for me:  I watched the movie on consecutive days and the film of the original Broadway cast in a live performance in between.  My feelings about the movie are unequivocal.

First the quibbles:

1) The baker's father's part was cut to practically nothing.  In the show, the baker's father was a comic foil until almost the end.

2) In the show, the narrator is a contributing performer (much to his regret).  I missed this more than the baker's father.  Perhaps not surprisingly, in most US productions the two roles are usually played by the same person.

That's it for the quibbles.  There are no other complaints.

This film is a unique rarity.  It is the only film of a Broadway show I know of, that is both 98% true to the show and even enhances it somewhat.  As you can imagine, there's only so much that can be done in portraying a giant on stage, a sky-high vine, or a dead cow for that matter (think of a small stuffed cow on wheels).  The movie also has more emotional impact.

For those not familiar with Into the Woods, there is no black or white.  There only a small handful of stereotypes; these consist of Cinderella's step mother and step sisters, and the wolf.  Even the wolf isn't mono-dimensional,  he's also charming.  Outside of that, all of the characters are both good and bad, petty and grand, generous and stingy.  If you're looking for a Fred Astaire musical, this ain't it.  This is not a condemnation of Fred Astaire musicals.  I'm pretty sure I have all of them on DVD or Blu-ray.  When I'm feeling glum, there's nothing better than 'Top Hat' or 'Shall We Dance', to mention just 2 of the many.  This movie musical goes much deeper: into wishes and outcomes and choices, opportunities and regrets.

There are subtleties of performance here that would not have worked on the stage, most notably Streep's witch.  Similarly there are certain broad gestures that work on stage that do not work in a movie.  The only exception is Depp's wolf, a delicious performance that would have worked equally well on stage, but without the freedom of movement.  Even there, the subtleties may have been lost on stage.

There are no weak performances here and the filming has the beauty I have only seen of late in contemporary Chinese films.

The bonus features are worth watching.  One of them shows how the art direction was implemented and how the woods were transformed throughout the film.

I had the relatively rare privilege of being able to participate in a run of the show in the mid-ish '90s.  While amused at first, I came to truly love the show.  This is currently my favorite show of all time.

There is a wonderful filming of a live stage performance (in front of an audience) with all of the original Broadway cast.  It was done by Image Entertainment and Brandman Productions, Inc.  Copyright date is 1990; there is a product number shown,  ID5967MBDVD.  If you love the movie, do try to get a copy of the filmed show (Amazon still sells it, the last time I checked).  You will find there are minor differences.  Roberta Peters plays a witch of a different color.  What is done with/to the cow is amazingly funny.  The narrator's consternation at being fed to the giant should not be missed.  Same with the baker's father's occasional nonsense interruptions of the story line.  Lastly, the original orchestration is unusual (2 violins, 2 violas, cello, bass, piano/synth, percussion, 2 horns, trumpet, flute, clarinet and bassoon) and worth hearing.",1428192000,2,4301,4.614266842800529

A very good friend tells me this production is amazing---on stage. However, on the big screen this doesn't translate well at all. The worst part--Johnny Depp as the Wolf enacting what is clearly a pedophile fantasy of taking Little Red Riding Hood (who HAS to be the Most annoying child actor in the history of Hollywood--whomever hired that girl should be immediately fired and put in prison for crimes against cinema!) I will never look at Depp the same way again.  We (all adults) squirmed through this scene.

First of all, I was kind of waiting for it to end by the middle of the movie. It felt like I was watching story bits and although
the characters did all come together it was not really fun or satisfying to watch as a movie for me. Think of other great musicals -
The Wizard of Oz, Little Shop of Horrors, Dreamgirls - you always end up singing some of the tunes the next day.
Well, when this was over, I barely remembered any song except the phrase ""into the woods"", and it felt like
an annoying song stuck on repeat. And don't get me started on the Johnny Depp part. What was that about? I'm
not prudish at all but that was just creepy in a bad way.

I am so tired of this new push to recreate classic fairy tales with elements of all that is wrong with society: pedophilia, rape, death, infidelity, lack of family structure, and the CONSTANT emasculation of all male figures. We get it. Enough all ready.

I watch movies as an escape form all of that in the real world. What ever happened to absolute good vs. absolute evil? A hero or heroine kicking some butt? Now its all about perspective and the point-of-view of the wicked, leading you to become sympathetic to the evil bad guy. Meh.

These type of anit-hero stories were a small subset of literary generas for a while, but have just spread like wildfire. Its just overplayed, boring, and doesn't create the escape you need when every character walks in the grey areas.

Combine this with a wolf who needs a rape van, an OVERLY annoying Red Riding-hood, pussified princes, and not enough Tracy Alman, you get this steaming heap of nonsensical trash that makes you wish you cut all your toes off instead of wasting 2 hours of your life.",1428192000,,1115,4.5879396984924625
6863190,3,B00Q7WBGHG,"My original headline for this review was ""Two movies for the price of one,"" because I just saw half of a really great movie and half of something designed by committee. But--like the stage musical--Into the Woods is chock-full of lovely scenery, nice tunes, competent acting, sparks of humor and other good things, so I figured it needed at least three stars.

The first half of the movie is a collage of Grimm's fairy tales with modern, more politically correct sensibilities; a childless baker and his wife learn they're the victims of a witch's curse. If they can find four objects in the woods--Rapunzel's golden hair, Jack's (of beanstalk fame) white cow, Cinderella's golden (golden?) slipper, and Little Red Riding Hood's red clock--and present them to the witch in time, the spell will be broken and they will have a child.

The protagonists in each tale come together, the child is born, Cinderella gets her prince, Rapunzel gets hers, Jack grabs the goose, and Red escapes the wolf. Act I ends pretty predictably, happily ever after. In Act II, Lapine and Sondheim decided to show the aftermath of fairy tales, the not-so-happily ever after: The slain giant's wife is laying waste to the kingdom, the princes are shiftless, the baker's wife has an affair with Cinderella's prince and falls off a cliff (or is killed by a giant in the stage version), and the survivors, sadder but wiser, learn to stick together.

Nice idea, but where it was the whole point (and worked) in the stage version, it comes out of left field in the movie. Rather than not-so-happily-ever-after, there's so much edited out (including major characters) that it seems as though the writers needed to kill time (and characters) to get to the end of the picture. It was still well acted, with nice effects...but Act II had nothing to do with Act I and made diddly-squat sense. Why, for example, were Cinderella and the prince so head-over-heels in love at their wedding, but almost completely disillusioned with each other a couple of days later?

So...not a bad choice, but either stop the movie before Act II, or have a book handy--it'll make the time go faster.",1428105600,2,2146,4.823369565217392

6863192,3,B00Q7WBGHG,"I am not a regular musical movie watcher but on occasion, I find some are intriguing enough to watch.  The storyline is interesting enough with the blending of various fairytales into an overarching story.  Unfortunately I found this movies presentation to be a bit flat and drab with songs that really lacked any memorable moments.  The section with Depp just seemed a bit creepy and weird and the movie dragged at times.  For me, when you compare musicals to the quality of Les Misrables or even the original outstanding stage musicals that these are based, then this version really falls short in my opinion.  This version isn't terrible but it does fall short of being outstanding either.

No, this is not as dark as the original play, nor as dark as the Grimm Brothers. Okay, now that we have gotten that out of the way I can move on to the actual review. While I love the play, even for the darkness and the ""look for yourselves"" meaning. However, this movie just wasn't up to the game. Disney wanted to cover up most of the dark stuff. Like how Rapunzel goes crazy after giving birth. Instead they let Rapunzel live happily ever after with her Prince (who was blinded, but she some how saved him with her tears) after they run away. Which is not horrible that they changed this, not by any means, however by changing it, it's as if they changed the true story. The movie in itself was decent. The acting was great, even Johnny Depp's was great (and let us all face the truth that his acting has gone down hill). The movie was just a little on the boring side. It's not that it was long, or anything, but it just seemed to drag on. I sat through the whole play which is longer than the movie and it didn't seem to drag that bad.

However, this time I was able to pull my babies to the happier, theater made movie side of things. Believe me, I know not every theater made movie is great. However, this movie should receive just credit. I will say I'm saddened that Bernadette Peters didn't make some kind of cameo, unless I missed it?",1428105600,,651,4.3884297520661155

Other than that, this was really boring to me.  I don't mind musicals, but this was continual singing, and not in a operatic way.  The songs seemed interminable and sounded too much alike and I found myself wanting them to end more than I was paying attention to them.

It is rather a shame, because I was  eager to watch it.  The concept was interesting, and the cast marvelous.  But I fault the writing and editing for not knowing when enough is enough, and getting in the way of the concept instead of enhancing it.",1428105600,,615,4.4375

First, most people say it's too long and has too much singing, come on people, it's a musical! It's based on classical fairy tales and everything, but it's a freaking musical. I LOVE musicals and I think that this one was GREAT. The songs were catchy and the voices beautiful, the script was brilluant and so was the acting.
If you're looking for a kids movie I'm sorry but this one is not what you want (my 7 years old loved it, though. But I wouldn't recommend it for little children in general). However if what you want is a great musical, then you should definitely watch it! I love the ending even if it's not particularly 'classic' but I think it's more realistic and it teaches a better lesson.

Besides, the cast is PERFECT. You can't go wrong with Meryl Streep",1428105600,2,887,4.311377245508982

For instance, Prince Charming cheats on Cinderella because the description of him in fairy tales is that he is only charming and not loyal. Well, that sucks, eh? At the end there is supposed to be a lesson for all to learn. Something they did not know, but now do. Lots of singing, but it is a musical after all. Wasn't worth renting.

6863249,3,B00Q7WBGHG,"Saw it in theaters when it came out. They should have kept to the original darker version rather than whitewashing it. It made it tedious and less emotional. If you want to see a great version just get the 1991 filmed Original Broadway cast production with Bernadette Peters. Spoilers. This is one of my favorite musicals and I do love it, but I would rather get the version where Rapunzel dies cause she went INSANE (now imagine the wich's reprise of children don't listen sung over Rapunzel's dead body instead of as she happily runs away with her prince. Heartbreaking isntead of meh. The point is THEY ARE BOTH RIGHT, and both wrong. And everybody has a different point of view, which is equally valid. and then they lost one of the funniest bits where both princes are silly jerks who leave Cinderella and Rapunzel for Snow White and Sleeping Beauty (I didn't realize how much I missed the reprise of Agony.) And where the fairytale creatures get so scared of the Giant and turn on each other trying to decide who to sacrifice to the giant they decide on the NARRATOR Cause he's not one of them anyway is he now... And he dies. That makes that scene far more powerful and far more interesting. There were lots of other little jokes that were missing as well throughout. Basically what happened is this musical lost it's bite, which is what made it interesting to begin with. Unfortunately for Disney there was nothing wrong with the first version, and this movie could have been a lot better if it just embraced it's darker roots. I saw the filmed original cast production when I was around 10, loved it, and my little cousins saw the filmed original cast production only 2 years ago and both LOVED it. It was over 3 hours long, and they were 9 and 10. If something holds a kids interest they can pay attention for a long time, believe you me. And it was interesting. I think that in trying to coddle children we make boring stories, and nothing is worse to me, as a child or now, than a boring story. We underestimate their ability to handle certain story elements like death and violence. Can we please remember that the original fairytale stories people were telling their children for centuries always had mature themes like death, violence, dubious morality, etc. These make us uncomfortable now sure but they also make us think. And don't even get me started on further back in the Greek and Roman Mythology. In sum the original Broadway cast version is infinitely better than this Disney one, once upon a time and many modern kids media. Get that version",1428105600,7,2566,4.604803493449782

6863253,3,B00Q7WBGHG,"The movie strives too hard to be both moral and enchanting.  ""Giants can be good,"" the characters sing, right before they kill off the second giant that is destroyed in the movie.  ""You are never alone"" they sing, even though through much of the movie, they are alone, and in real life many people have experienced being ""utterly alone"".  (Quote from Beetlejuice.)  Being alone is not necessarily a bad thing, by the way -- the movie shows that in abundance as the alone characters gather strength and a greater sense of their own individuality.  This movie could have been great if Sondheim had just figured out where he stood on the issue of aloneness/individuality vs. group consciousness/responsibility to the group.",1428105600,2,720,4.966666666666667
6863254,3,B00Q7WBGHG,"Having seen both this version and the original Broadway version, I knew the plot before the film even started.  It's a fun amalgamation of various fairy tales and how ""happy ever after"" has multiple meanings, and Sondheim's muscials are always fun and easily accessable for everybody.

What distressed me about this is that at times it seemed that what was being sung didn't match with what the mouths of the actors were saying.  There were times that the mouth/voice mismatch was close to half a second, and times, especially during the faster bits, that the words from the actor didn't match the song!  With that, it was very obvious that everything was recorded in two parts - once for the camera, and then once in a studio for the singing.  I've seen other musicals that have done this, and in them you can't see any separation.  Because of that mismatch, it was harder for me to enjoy this version.",1428105600,2,903,4.647798742138365

The witch lost her powers for me that is a no no, I would have been fine if she had a horrible end. In some cases that is what happened but if you read up on the original play she just went where her mother was which means it wasn't actually an end even if she went to the spiritual world.

I wanted to kill puppies while it was on, but puppies are too cute to hurt. So I burned some origami birds instead. Still felt cheated. Merryl Streep still looks fantastic, though.

6863401,4,B00Q7WBGHG,"Walt Disney Home Entertainment takes us on a dark and dazzling journey Into the Woods with this mashup of the many fairy tales theyve so colorfully brought to the screen in animation form before. If you can imagine Once Upon a Time loaded with never-ending musical numbers you have a good idea what to expect from this impressive film. Besides a few spots where you know you're on a movie set, audiences will no doubt get lost in the land of make-believe Director Rob Marshall transports you to.

In Into the Woods, a baker (James Corden) and his wife (Emily Blunt) are childless as the result of the curse of a once-beautiful witch (Meryl Streep). Three days before the rise of a blue moon, they venture into the forest to find the ingredients that will reverse the spell and restore the witch's beauty: a milk-white cow, hair as yellow as corn, a blood-red cape, and a slipper of gold. During their journey, they meet Cinderella (Anna Kendrick), Little Red Riding Hood (Lilla Crawford), Rapunzel (Mackenzie Mauzy) and Jack (Daniel Huttlestone), each one on a quest to fulfill a wish.

Disney gives us a few bonus features for the Into the Woods Blu-ray edition. Meryl Streep performs a never-before-seen Steven Sondheim original song entitled Shell Be Back. It was composed for the movie and introduced by Director Rob Marshall. The featurette The Cast As Good As Gold shows the cast digging deeper into the experience of making the film. Deeper into the Woods is made up of four Making of featurettes including The Magic of the Woods. Commentary by the filmmakers is included as well. Viewers can also skip to their favorite songs throughout the movie. Theres even more to be found.

The movie is rated PG for thematic elements, fantasy action and peril, and some suggestive material. There are some surprisingly adult-type situations towards the end of the movie when the mood of the film switches gears. The nods to the original Grimms fairy tales might be a bit too disturbing for younger viewers as well.

Into the Woods will be a big hit with audiences into the theater and musicals. It takes an interesting turn in its third act which, if youve never seen the production before, will come as a shock to those who want to live happily ever after. I do have to say some of the sets look and feel stagey, which took me out of the viewing experience at times. The singing and performances by the entire cast were spot-on. Unfortunately, I really don't enjoy this sort of thing and cant imagine Ill ever revisit the Woods.

Into the Woods is available now on Blu-ray, DVD, and as a Digital Download.",1428019200,,2603,4.699561403508772

6863406,3,B00Q7WBGHG,"This is a full blown musical rendition of several fairy tales wrapped around a story line written for the film. The film cast contains many very famous and skilled actors. Merle Streep does a great job as one of the main characters who is the witch.

The fairy tales are Jack and the Bean Stalk, Little Red Riding Hood, Cinderella and Rapunzel. Please be aware that the stories are twisted together as to appear to interact around the story about a baker and his wife who are childless. They also have a darker ending and not a happy ending as you might expect from a Disney film. You might want to review that with your children before you watch it together.

Overall the film was just OK. I liked the film but I did not love it. I felt that at times it just seems to drag along. I rated it at three stars.",1428019200,,807,4.233766233766234
6863407,3,B00Q7WBGHG,"Into the Woods the musical  which I never saw maybe better than this Disney adaptation. The movie has a bright good look from the start when the different fairy tale characters are introduced and even the songs are good. It got me hooked. But once the characters go INTO THE WOODS the cast looks totally lost & without direction. The tone of the movie changes to a very dark unappealing movie set even scary for young children more like INTO THE BLACK FOREST!!!!. The songs become monotonous with preachy lyrics & the movie turns into a one flat story with nothing new or interesting to tell and really NO CLIMAX!!! The main characters are just left behind sitting looking lost in the woods. Even the great Ms. Meryl Streep can't bring her portrayal of the witch to an interesting acting level. I love Disney movies grew up watching all the classics, but lately to my taste, either the studio makes a really terrific movie with a love story, bright & wonderful magical special effects like the new live action CINDERELLA (LOVE IT!!!!) or something so dark and ugly like MALEFICENT (DID NOT LIKE AT ALL!!!!)

Not wanting to stop a movie that was 'almost done' we hung in there more than another hour. The movie never really built any momentum or any suspense that made me not want to get off the couch. I found myself reaching for my smartphone more than a couple times.
There were some mildly funny points, but nothing that would actually make you laugh aloud. There were some emotional parts, but nothing that really made me feel the way I presume the character was feeling - and to me that is at the fault of the director.",1427932800,,837,4.30379746835443

6863453,4,B00Q7WBGHG,"First, to those of you who have never seen the musical:  This is not a happy fairy tale, despite any impression you got from the preview and the fact that Disney made it.  My 8 year old watched it and loved it, but I had warned her before hand that in the second half the fairy tales fall apart.  If you don't have an oversensitive child there is nothing too scary or inappropriate (besides some kissing and implied violence :  )  I actually wanted my children to see this, because the deconstruction of the fairy tales teaches us that happily ever after is not the end of the story and that getting every thing you dreamed of may still lead you dissatisfied.  Some of the cuts made to the musical leave some of the second half not making much sense, so if you're confused watch the original to get the full story!
Second, to those of you who know and love the Broadway original:  The Disney version has its high and low points.  For the most part the cast is fantastic.  I actually enjoy the Baker more than the original, as he is much funnier and easier to sympathize with and the Baker's wife was on par with the original.  Rapunzel's prince also is more sympathetic and adds some come relief that this production seriously needed.  My daughter enjoyed that Little Red and Jack were younger, but we both agreed the witch fell flat.  Meryl Streep can sing and acted the part, but she just lacks the silliness and fun Bernadette Peters gave the part.  Johnny Depp was a complete disaster and ruined one of the musical's great songs, but thankfully his role is short.

In fact, I wondered if it wasn't produced by Jerry Springer when it seemed the Prince and The Baker's Wife were getting frisky despite his recent betrothal to Cinderella. Often it was unclear where characters had disappeared to and I found that none of the actors evoked anything to connect one to said characters.

this did well as a stage production, but it did not translate well into film.  I cannot stress how terrible this film is. The story line is ridiculous and the music and lyrics are mediocre.  I don't care that these are well known directors, producers and actors.  The acting was at best mediocre and at worst over the top.  The only redeeming factors were the costuming, makeup and set design.  Meryl Streep looked beautiful in her blue wig and gown. That and the fact that the movie finally ended are the only positive things I can say about it.  I fast forwarded through a lot of the singing.  It was that bad.

I was confused because I had heard that they left out the fling between the Baker's Wife and Cinderella's Prince and it was there. I also heard Johnny Depp getting a bad review for his role as the wolf and I thought that he was delightful. In the stage production, the Wolf is often much more sexual and with Little Red being played by such a young girl, Depp's performance was perfect. James Corden made me cry, in a good way, he was just wonderful as the Baker. The Princes' Agony duet was great, though I felt they could have even been campier with it.

6863472,4,B00Q7WBGHG,"Before you begin to complain, a few points:
1. This is the adaptation of a Sondheim musical which premiered almost 30 years ago.  You should already know that, it's basic cultural literacy.
2. This is based on the Grimms version of Cinderella.  Disney was not involved in writing it and it does not use their patently idiotic version of the story, so yes-- people have their eyes pecked out and there IS blood in the shoe.
3. This is not for children.
Now that being said, I'm already pretty lukewarm when it comes to Sondheim.  While this is better than The film version of Sweeney Todd, it's not exactly perfect as it did cut about 30 minutes or so of material for runtime and lost the reprise of ""Agony"" and the attendant extra princesses.  It also hand waved a few of the bawdier moments, partially to cover for the younger actress (the original actress was in her late teens in the stage production) playing Little Red.  This is a shame because Little Red as original source material was pretty dirty (if points 2 and 3 were shocking to you, don't bother with Grimms Little Red, it's always been a sexual assault allegory) and toning it down made some of her lyrics a bit confusing. It's as good a film adaptation as one could hope for, all things considered.",1427846400,,1264,4.526315789473684
6863473,1,B00Q7WBGHG,Very un-entertaining movie.  Not worth watching.,1427846400,,48,7.0
6863474,3,B00Q7WBGHG,"Let me just start off with: yes, I am a huge fan of the Stephen Sondheim original stage production.

That being said, it's hard to give an unbiased review. But I did see this movie with a friend who had never seen the musical so I'm also incorporating her thoughts post-viewing.

This play revolves around several entertwined fairy tales (Rapunzel, Red Riding Hood, Cinderella, Jack and the Beanstalk, to name a few), and is designed to entertain the viewer with beloved fairy tales while also standing them on their heads to provoke an emotional look into the world and the nature of growing up. The movie, well.....the movie tried.

The first half of the film was nearly perfect. It actually makes the second half more disheartening because of how on-the-nose the first half of the film really was. I say nearly, because there is one large, terrible flaw in the first half that I will call JOHNNY DEPP STARS IN: THE CAT IN THE HAT.

Really, I could spend an hour complaining about it, but since I already tortured my friend with that I'm going to skip it. But really it boils down to the fact that the style decisions/story decisions they made with the Wolf character rendered that storyline toothless. And I can get that, I guess, as it is Disney and they wanted to reduce down the ""sexual"" nature of Red Riding Hood's story by aging the character down and giving us a Wolf that looked like he'd gotten loose from the latest Tim Burton film. But overall, it's a symptom of a much bigger problem of this film.

As for my friend, she found the second half of the movie a lot choppier and rushed than the beginning- for her the movie was wonderfully set out at the beginning, but quickly devolved as everything started to fracture/stand on its head. She found it a little overwhelming, which makes sense as the second half (actually known to be a bit slower in the stage production) needs some time to really sink into the viewer's heads as they begin to realize that not everything is going to end well for these characters.

Acting wise, I thought James Corden, Chris Pine, Emily Blunt, and Anna Kendrick did really well. Obviously Meryl Streep was great, which was surprising for me since I was a little worried about her in a musical (silly me, but I blame post-Mamma Mia trauma) and the child actors weren't annoying, which is the best you can really say about them.

The overall message of Into the Woods is that things don't always turn out with a happy ending, and nothing is black and white. Witches can be right, giants can be good, and it's up to the characters (and viewers) to decide what is right and what is good. This is basically glossed over in the second half by several story changes and eliminated songs. I won't spoil it. But if you want to watch Meryl Streep in some truly fabulous gowns, and beautiful cinematography, go see this. If you want a thoughtful and evocative discussion of morality, ethics, and growing up.....go get the original Bernadette Peters version that's available through PBS. You won't be sorry.",1427846400,4,3040,4.618518518518519

That is, if the kids manage to sit all the way through it. As an adult, there were several things that were quite troubling to me:  I thought there was more than a hint of pedophilia in Johnny Depp's wolf, which I found to be chilling.  Prince Charming was a vain, opportunist without a shred of commitment to his new-found princess.  Last, several of the main characters got killed off, but there didn't seem to be much reason for that as far as the story went.  The giant's wife got a bum rap, a really strange male voice, and a mediocre, half-baked  bit part for Frances de la Tour.  She deserved better,
Not even Streep could save this film, and I'm rather surprised she took the script.  I would not have recognized Sondheim's music had I not read the reviews.

6863486,5,B00Q7WBGHG,"Like others, I was a bit disappointed in the movie as compared to the play....BUT it was done just about as well as could possibly have been done in a Disney film.
Some parts had to be cut (wolf scene having carnal undertones),  and some just not politically correct  (""dwarves are very upsetting"") enough to make it into the movie.
This does make the movie pale next to the stage version, but it is pretty much a given when one medium is translated to another.
The characters were fun, the songs always good (Sondheim, what else?) and, of course, the story full of little tricks and treats.
If you enjoy musicals you will love this...and if you don't...well, this may not be the best film for you.",1427846400,2,698,4.488188976377953
6863487,5,B00Q7WBGHG,"My first Sondheim experience was in college, playing in the pit for ""A Little Night Music"".  I've had the pleasure of participating in many others since, including ""Company"" and even ""Passion"".

Going into this film, I wasn't so sure of the producers' ability to pull off a legitimate Sondheim/Lapine experience... but boy, did they!  The task was to balance between the randomness and audience interaction of a live program, against the more clinical calculation of creating an artistic, native film experience.  Each medium has its strengths and weaknesses, and this effort straddled those nicely.

This flat-out soared, and there were tears welling up in my eyes as the film drew to its closing minutes.  It was obvious, the level of effort here was extraordinary.

I highly recommend Into The Woods for those with an open mind to ""musical"" as a complete, unified artistic statement... think ""symphony of the stage"".

(I can't resist one admittedly argumentative parting shot for the legion of one-star ""reviews"" currently overwhelming Amazon's ratings: just because you perhaps don't have the depth of patience, artistic sensitivity, or non-closed-minded expectations to appreciate this film, doesn't make the film BAD.  Personally, I've tired of musicals that consist largely of random, two-to-three-minute pop songs sprinkled as a fleeting amusement, alongside a predictable and shallow ""feel-good"" narrative.  But that doesn't make them bad, either.)",1427846400,2,1457,5.493273542600897

I was really hoping to find a more Malificent type movie where the fairy tales were done with real people but with a twist I did not see coming.

Also, this musical was probably just to dark for Disney to take on. Overall, for people that are not familiar with the original musical it would be a good film. Johnny Dep was a bad choice for the wolf. His singing was flat and and his part was basically Jack Sparrow with sort of a wolf costume. The Red Riding Hood part was more whiny than I felt it should have been. Then the part of Jack, in musicals it generally isn't a good idea to use boys that are going through a voice change? It seamed like his voice was changing throughout the whole film. Meryl Streep was amazing as always as was Anna Kendrick and Chris Pine.

6863525,1,B00Q7WBGHG,"If possible I would give zero (0) stars. It does not deserve even 1. It's a kind of twisted, pagan, sinful and even morbid mind movie. The scene where the wolf is with the child resembles more a about to abduct a girl-sadistic pedophile event. A kid who steals receive a reward and to help to kill the wife of the man who stole, that also was killed. A married woman, who wants to get pregnant with her husband, rolls and are clearly imply that there privacy in the forest with a prince, who is also married, and even, they say to each other, 'Oh this was another story'. A Cinderella's sisters got cut off their fingers toes to fit the cinderella's shoe and any number of atrocities more. I can only say that Walt Disney must be turning around in the tomb. It reminds me more to a cheap low budget films that happen at 2:00 am when I'm insomniac and there is nothing more to see on TV at that time. I do not recommend nor put into free TV.  Terrible and bad in every way.",1427846400,,972,4.170212765957447
6863526,3,B00Q7WBGHG,This is a good adaption. Better than any of the more recent musicals Hollywood has tried to produce. WAY WAY better than Les Mis,1427846400,2,128,4.375
6863527,2,B00Q7WBGHG,"The unusual distribution of star ratings speaks volumes to the polarization that Sondheim inspires.  That and the fact that a lot of viewers no doubt went in expecting something else.  Everyone who recommended this to me did so with the same qualification, they liked it ""but, you have to go in expecting that it's almost entirely sung"".  And so it is.  Like an opera, in the sense that whatever dialog exists is between that which is sung, unlike say a more traditional musical (like ""Oklahoma"" or ""South Pacific"", or even ""Chicago"") where brilliant songs interrupt the dialog, which then resumes, after the music dies down.  I would hasten to add:  If your idea of opera is a lot of screeching or caterwauling, this is not that sort of music;  rather, the melodic soundtrack into which the dialog is set is thoroughly modern, much more limited in vocal range and expression, and, unfortunately, never once rises to the breathtaking levels of an aria.  There isn't even a great song anywhere in the film.
And, for whatever reason, while the first two thirds of the film are mostly sung, the last third is mostly spoken.

The story is simple, and since the play first came out, several movies have taken the idea and run with it---as have at least a couple of TV shows:  A childless baker and his wife make a wish.  Cinderella makes a wish.  Jack makes a wish.  Rapunzel makes a wish.  Red Riding Hood makes a wish (with Johnny Depp as the wolf, no less) and it turns out that all their wishes intersect at the same shallow, wretched witch that is Meryl Streep's character (who, thankfully, does not so much sing) and it turns out that wishes have consequences.  Also, Cinderella does not have a pumpkin carriage, she just runs away.  Unfortunately, she keeps showing up and running away as if she's caught in some strange loop.  The baker keeps trying to prevent his wife from helping him, even though she seems far more competent than he.  Eventually, everyone realizes they need to work together, and even then the ending is more ""realistic"" than happy---although not realistic enough for Sondheim fans who sat through the play.

 In any event, despite, the massive, star studded cast (which included many of my favorites) the story just petered out before the end of the film.  The music became tiresome and the lyrics such that were, too earnestly clever, cloying.

It's not a bad film.  More like ""Maleficent"", and probably ""Cinderella"", when it comes to instant tv.  Although, both of those films had absolutely dreadful music, far far worse than this.",1427846400,,2559,4.763636363636364
6863528,1,B00Q7WBGHG,"This film is disgusting. It starts out as an entertaining quirky musical but then deteriorates into a very subversive, almost political, perversity. The wolf seduction of a child, the child talking about excitement and pleasure, and then after that the various characters are represented with hate, violence, sexual innuendos, all woven with a vicious presentation of every sort of character flaw. This is certainly not a film for any child or young personand those I watched it with agreed it was written and produced as an attack against moral standards presented as an amusement. Everyone I was with hated it and two of us have been involved with film making for many years. It also is unbearably long.",1427846400,4,705,4.983050847457627

The story itself is an adult (mature theme, kinds wouldn't understand) fairy tale and is a commentary on responsibility. When one views it in that light, the movie begins to  make quite a bit of sense. Almost every one in the movie does some rationalizing to get what they want, but as in life, our efforts to compromise what we know is right usually gets us in trouble.

6863593,5,B00Q7WBGHG,"Rob Marshall seems to be the only person presently in Hollywood who knows how to successfully translate a Broadway musical to the big screen.  His direction of CHICAGO was nothing short of brilliant, and he once again scores high marks for this wonderful Stephen Sondheim creation. The overall visual settings are stunning in their dark and dangerous atmospherics.  But it is the clear and concise presentation of the very complex musical scenes that allow this film to blossom.  Why are we not surprised that Meryl Streep turns in another superb performance in an area (musical theater) with which she is not readily associated.  Frankly she may be the world's best actor - without any stylistic limitation.  Emily Blunt, Anna Kendrick, Johnny Depp and the two youngsters each turn in outstanding performances. The one weak link is Mr. James Cordon who is disappointing in the role of the baker.  While he may be outstanding as a zany comic with mass audience appeal, his work here is not at the same level as the rest of the cast.

The music is not well written or engaging. One of the songs will become the anthem for every pedophile (and gave me the creeps).

I think to avoid the ""They lived happily ever after"", the writers decided to ruin everyone's life - infidelity (just because two people met in the woods - another horrible song), multiple deaths of parents, blinded stepsisters (who already had toes and heels cut off to fit in the shoe - yes, I know the original version of the story includes the maiming of feet).

6863635,5,B00Q7WBGHG,"I had to post a review after seeing some of the negative reviews of this film.  I saw this play at the Kennedy Center about 25 years ago and have always loved the story.  I was nervous to hear Disney was making a version of it as I was afraid they'd take the soul out of it.  They didn't.  This movie is wonderful and should be seen by everyone who loves a great intellectual musical.  Yes, the story has great emotional and intellectual depth to it, and if you're expecting typical Disney sugar-coated fare, you will be disappointed.  This is not a fun, feel good movie.  It's a brilliant, complex emotionally wrenching musical.  Almost every line in the movie is sung, so you have to listen closely to follow the story, and then you have to think...  I notice most of the negative reviews appear to be from people who made no effort to understand what they were about to see and expected a kids movie.  This is not a kids movie.  However, Disney did a pretty good job of staying true to the original play, but making it ""safe"" for kids.  It's probably too intense for real young kids, but my 10 and 12 year olds loved it.  Disney toned down the touchier moments so that kids will just think it's the typical fairy tale and the darkness will go over their heads, but adults can still get the what's really happening when the wolf meets red riding hood in the woods, and the prince rendezvous with the baker's wife.  Don't let the Disney label mislead you... if you're wanting it to be a sappy kids tale, you'll be shockingly surprised.  If you think it can't possibly be good for adults because it's from Disney and you want something deeper, you'll be pleasantly surprised.  People expecting a fairy tale should at least be aware that this is based on the Grimm's version of the fairy tales and not pan it because it has some dark moments and they didn't bother to educate themselves first.",1427673600,4,1892,4.440579710144927
6863636,1,B00Q7WBGHG,Aww I can't stand it. Great plot horrible story. I was more interested in watching my dog play his toy during the fim. I read the bad reviews and thought oh I'd give it a try thank gosh I only rented it at Redbox. Save your time and money please.,1427673600,,246,3.94
6863637,2,B00Q7WBGHG,"Interesting story but am so tired of politically correct movie attempts.  None of the songs will be memorable for me but the talking singing was ok.  I am surprised there were no gay or race stories in this but it is Disney. They sang even giants are good people and then they kill the giant, ha.  Movie was way too long, strange but mildly entertaining.  Not for young kids. I was overly disappointed.  Glad I did not see this in the theatre and will not see it if or when it becomes a play.",1427673600,,492,4.191489361702128
6863638,1,B00Q7WBGHG,"This is the worst movie I have ever seen. Period. And I feel like that is saying something because I have watched every one of M. Night Shyamalan's movies and also sat through Jonathan Glazer's ""Under the Skin""... As much as I wanted to track these directors down and get my money back from them personally... this movie takes the cake.  I cannot believe that Disney actually made this, and am a little disappointed that they flagrantly threw around infidelity and undertones of child molestation in a ""family movie"".  While I will admit that the premise of this movie is awesome!  Having all of the Disney fairytales colliding was a great idea.  Musicals?! I'm game.  Top notch actors?! Who wouldn't?  Taking my two daughters and their friends to see Johnny Depp for a whopping five minutes of a two hour long movie, to hear him sing about how ""delicious"" a little girl is...  this movie should come with a free shower and rape whistles....",1427673600,5,941,4.701219512195122

6863640,5,B00Q7WBGHG,"I love Sondheim's music/musicals and this is one of my favorites.  While the original Broadway version with Bernadette Peters was superior in numerous ways, the film adaption does give the musical justice and the addition of a growing beanstalk, actual meanderings in the woods and the special effects, while leaving less to the imagination, does bring more action to the screen.

As far as stage to movie adaptations go, I thought it was fairly faithful to the original and I thought the actors were great. The songs were catchy enough that I bought the movie cast soundtrack as well. This story is an interesting twist on the idea of happily ever after, offering interesting themes about life, parenthood, and love among other things. The characters in this movie, despite their setting in a fairy tale world, are realistic and sympathetic, not always sure of exactly what they want or what lengths to go to to get the things they think they desire. All of the characters make mistakes that affect the courses of their lives, but at the same time no one comes across as irredeemable or beyond understanding.

I have watched it 4 times since then, and was in a puddle by the end (and several points inbetween) each time I watched it.  A powerful musical, a powerful film.  Rob Marshall knows how to transfer/translate a stage play to the screen, and brings this one alive.  Many thanks and credit to teh extraordinary cast  All the performances were brilliant/exact/insightful.  And the message of this glorious piece of theatre is as timeless as the fairytales it draws its characters from.  Some of the (negative) reviewers of this film shoudl watch it again - and perhaps heed one of the film's central message:  Careful what you say,  children are listening....  Careful what you wish, wishes come true - not free...

For those of you out there determined to spread your negative messages, I offer you one from my dad:  If you don't have anything nice to say - say nothing at all. :)",1427673600,2,1017,4.491803278688525

Did it keep my attention, and was I still thinking about it the next day or did I forget I even watched it?  Well, this film was an overwhelming no for myself and my husband.  We both took turns falling asleep during the film.  No, we weren't tired before we started watching but it quickly put us to sleep.  When it did cross my mind the next day it was because I wondered how much was the rental cost we paid to sleep through it.  I never wondered what happened during the parts I missed.  I had no desire to find out.  It was just too slow for us.  The singing was beautiful.  There's no denying the talent of the cast but it felt more like they were singing me to sleep rather than brining me into an adventure.

6863722,5,B00Q7WBGHG,"One of the hopes some of us had that ""Into the Woods"" would eventually become a movie was that this mash-up of fairy tales, with some of the best songs ever written, would reach a far greater audience than the stage musical (fortunately available with the original cast--it is fantastic) alone could.  But judging from many of the one star reviews here, one wonders whether a large segment of the population is just too dense and dumb to ever get a Sondheim show, even one as accessible as Into the Woods.  Or were they never adequately prepared for what was coming?  And yes, folks, people do sing in movie musicals.  That is why they are called musicals.

So for the uninitiated, this is NOT a typical Disney show, nor one that ever was written with a Disney audience in mind.  It is a Sondheim/Levine show, toned down a bit in its darkness, which Disney has produced and made, with Sondheim advising.

Sondheim's lyrics and music are sophisticated and complex--this is higher art than the usual far of what we are fed--and it requires a few listenings to really get or understand.  But once you get the songs, you realize that Sondheim's music is not unmelodic at all, though it stretches your ears a bit at first. But one day you realize it is just gets in your blood and you realize the songs really ARE beautiful musically--each a piece of art that pays huge dividends for a lifetime.  And once you get to know them, the songs' unparalleled lyrics reveal new insights into life after practically every listening.  Sondheim's songs usually cannot be lifted right out of the story the way they are in many other musicals--they are deeply woven into the story of the show and are part of the plot.

All that said, this movie adaptation was not nearly as bad as I had feared it would be, having finally dared now to watch it.  I miss some of the music from the stage show--especially the song ""No More"", which I thought was a cornerstone piece in the original show.  And I thought this DVD was to have, as a bonus feature, some new song that Sondheim wrote for Meryl Streep, which then also got cut--but it is not on my copy.  Oh well, I am not going to dock it for that.

Sondheim apparently had to make some compromises to keep Disney happy--and for executives to demand that he cut lines or songs seems a little bit to me like telling Beethoven how he should edit the 9th Symphony--who would have the temerity if they had any respect for the guy at all?--but Sondheim apparently obliged them, knowing this may the only chance he would have in his lifetime to get 80-90% of the show to the big screen with some of his input.  And what got to the screen is most pretty good to excellent.

Generally, all of the singing is very good.  Of course they are not the same as in the original Broadway show--nothing ever will be--but I really enjoyed hearing some new interpretations of the songs--like hearing the songs you already know and love, but from a slightly different angle.  Meryl Streep was particularly great, as was James Corden, Anna Kendrick, and the actors playing Jack and Little Red Riding Hood. The only one I rolled my eyes a little bit over was Johnny Depp's wolf--not quite evil enough maybe? I thought he would be a bit more wolf and a little less Johnny Depp.  Still, it wasn't awful. The movie preserved most of the essence of the Broadway show, though it wasn't quite as humorous--probably more due to the limitations of film and advantages of live theater than anything.

So while what we have here may be wasted on a lot of the fools who have never seen a musical, or people unfamiliar with Sondheim, or people who thought they were getting something like ""Frozen"",  and while it will never eclipse the original stage production for all of the great things it had and still has, I believe the world is far better off with this movie than without it--if this is the only movie version that was ever going to get made with Sondheim around to advise--he's in his 80s now.  It is still much more Sondheim than Disney.  I would give it 4 or 4.25 stars and dock it one for the cuts that Disney forced on it--except I still like most of what remains anyway--and with all the ignoramuses giving it one star, I will round it up to 5, as it really is a lot better than the average is currently showing.  And for those still complaining, remember what Hollywood did to ""A Funny Thing Happened"", ""A Little Night Music"", and (not quite as bad) ""Sweeney Todd"", to say nothing of a lot of non Sondheim musicals. It could have been a lot worse.  In time, more people will come to understand and appreciate it.",1427587200,6,4617,4.486260454002389

We like musicals, but this is truly awful, the songs have no melody whatsoever. It's just actors sing-talking their lines.",1427587200,2,672,4.341269841269841

I had never seen it on stage and was THRILLED when Tim Burton decided to do it with his favorite stars.  People who HATE musicals love SWEENY TODD.  Of course there is no mistaking what ST is about.
 I saw INTO THE WOODS on stage many years ago, and I loved it, even though I knew I had missed a great deal, (nosebleed section)...
Stephen Soundheim is unmatched in the business; he is a true American gem.
I did not see this movie in the theater; I waited for it's blu ray release so I could make use of the ""subtitile"" option.  Those buyers who ""didn't get it"", or were unimpressed, .... blah blah blah, I would recommend turning on the subtitles, you cannot miss the words.  Soundheim puts words together so beautifully, I can only compare him to Edgar Alan Poe, who wrote very dark, very brilliant work and his use of the language- breath-taking in its mastery....
I love this movie and will view it many times in the future...  I was a little disappointed that Johnny Depp's wolf was short, because he was perfect and the costume was brilliant.  However, this was Meryl Streep's movie.  She is an actress who has never stopped challenging herself and she always respects the material she is performing; she is awesome.  Just awesome.
So from the Birdster this movie is easily awarded 5 stars....Those of you who were so very critical, try it again with the subtitles.  The only fault I find in Amazon reviews sometimes is it makes the cliche' ""everyone's a critic"" all too true.  To be critical is not necessarily to be negative.  There is a difference.

6863796,3,B00Q7WBGHG,"I have such mixed feelings about this film version vs the Broadway version. Even though Into The Woods uses elements of fairy tales, it is definitely not a children's story. Several of the changes made for the film, including the elimination of the Agony Reprise and several other songs, and the toning down of the sexual innuendo in Hello Little Girl, seem to weaken the punch of the musical and make the later portion feel somewhat thin. Judging by some of the other reviews, I'm not alone in this assessment. I wonder if Disney was perhaps not the right studio for this project.

The performances themselves worked well for me. I thought Meryl Streep did a fine job as the Witch and I've become a fan of both Emily Blunt and Anna Kendrick. Chris Pine's performance was a revelation. I've loved him as Captain Kirk. Who knew he has such a terrific singing voice?! Daniel Huttlestone, last seen as Gavroche in Les Mis, is a perfectly reasonable Jack. His performance was fun to watch.

I'm glad I saw this version, but I'm not sure I needed to own it. I wish they'd stuck closer to the tone of the play and pitched it for a more grown-up audience.",1427500800,5,1148,4.514423076923077

They kept much of it true to the original, although I was majorly disappointed that the reprise of ""Agony"" was cut, especially when they did such a great job with it in the first act. I thought I would miss the narrator as a character, but I think what they did with it made sense for the movie version. They did Disneyfy some of the deaths and completely cut one, which was also a bit disappointing if you know the stage show. I understand why they made some of the cuts/changes they did and they did do a good job of keeping the second act flowing nicely (I've always thought the stage version drags a bit towards the end of the second act).

6863823,1,B00Q7WBGHG,"First I just wanted to say that I've been a big fan of the musical play when I was much younger.  The magic of imagination, the grown-up humor thrown in for good measure, Bernadette Peters and Joanna Gleason making for both great talent in both singing and in their acting/dramatics to say nothing of making for some incredible eye-candy, as they always do.  They never disappoint.  Overall it boasted some great singing, humor, beautiful costumes, it had a cool idea with the fairy tale mashup concept,  it had great sight gags, was creative in every respect,  and best of all not only did it allow the audience the great magic that was the idea of the musical itself but also it allowed the audience the fun of imagining what it would be like if all of that which went on in the play was real.  Sondheim really came through with the musical.

Sadly that just didn't prove to be the case with this complete train-wreck of a movie.  I mean what was Disney honestly thinking?  Nobody in this turkey could act except for the little girl who played Little Red Riding Hood and the little boy who played Jack(he was great in Les Miserables also).  The only criticism I had of the kid who played Jack is his cockney British accent proved quite annoying and hammy after a while.  Everybody else was just atrocious in both acting and singing.  Their performances were in general, amateurish.  And as the the guy who played the Baker well, not only was his performance horrible, but 2 things:  1. He's some obscure actor that I'm totally unfamiliar with.  I mean who is he anyway?  And 2. He just comes off like some super-lame Stephen Lee wannabe.  He'll never be that cool.

It's ironic that one of the songs is called ""Agony"" considering that exactly what I was feeling while sitting through this crap.  To say nothing of how embarrassing that stupid scene was with the 2 princes acting like totally immature dorks, jumping around in the stream, sashaying and singing that very song badly.  While the plot for the Baker and his beautiful wife was clear and why Little Red Riding Hood and Jack were walking around the woods was clear,  it wasn't clear at all as to what everybody else was walking around the woods for.  In the musical they made that very clear and the tie-in of the characters was handled very naturally and not forced, but in this so-called movie adaptation, they came about it in quite the opposite way.

Johnny Depp makes a very forgettable small appearance as ""The Big Bad Wolf"".  Not only did he not look particularly wolf-like as much as a tacky dresser, but the way that that character was approached was far too sickening and just plain wrong!  The Big Bad Wolf just comes off like a sick, twisted pedophile!  WTH?!!  The Baker cutting him open to save Little Red Riding Hood, could have been done without actually showing him doing it.  Granted it wasn't gross visually, but just it being said what he did would've been enough.  Also, showing the inside of the wolf where Red went and making his stomach look silky was just plain stupid.  On stage that would be acceptable but in a movie not even.

The grownup humor and dark humor were chopped up to the point where, the grown-up humor was removed all together, where kissing is mentioned  only to remove any implication of sex.  That's just plain terrible!  As Cinderella's evil stepsisters getting parts of their feet sawed off just to try and fit in the glass slipper and be with the prince, well that's one part of the musical play that shouldn't have been used for this movie.  To be fair while in the musical play it proved darkly funny especially since the audience can see that it's not real and it was done with a light touch.  Besides the actresses in the musical were comedic in their non-chalance about it.  But in this movie it was done in a way that was just plain sickening, dark, and humorless.  Which brings me to another point, this movie took itself way too seriously!  Nothing about it was light-hearted, darkly funny, nor funny in general.  This movie seemed to float more towards mean-spirited behavior and darker tones instead of being light and charming overall.

The special effects by the way, were ridiculously cartoonish looking and looked about as bad as the corny and unconvincing special used for the Twilight movies.  They were terrible effects to the point of laughter.  They should've worked on them longer.

It ran way too long.  When it comes to a play and/or musical, a long running time of like 2 to 3 hours(or more) would be to be expected, in particular with intermission time, but when it comes to a movie adaptation, well I expect it to be shorter.  It just dragged on and on to oblivion.  To make matters worse the movie's pacing was just too uneven, whatwith having some songs that were really short, others that went on so long that the flow of the movie was much too delayed and even many of the scenes that were without singing would drag on for far too long.  Also if it had ended with the happy ending that it looked like it was going to have then I wouldn't have enjoyed it but I could've felt that it had its moments of entertainment.  Unfortunately, instead the movie drags it through the dirt for a highly unneccessary half hour more with them fighting with a female giant.  That song about who's fault it was that the giant was among was not only idiotic, but considering they're in danger it would've been smarter to take the situation more seriously than play the blame game.  Also, it just had to get into the whole moral thing about whether it's better to band together or hand the person responsible for the male giants death over to her.  I won't give away who the giant's after, but it's not hard to figure out who.

To sum it up this dreadfully horrific so-called Disney adaptation of ""Into the Woods"" is badly acted for the most part, getting mostly big stars that were forced to contend with a bad script, hammy and unconvincing acting,  amateurish and painfully bad singing, uneven pacing/lousy editing,  no charm, no adult humor, dark humor, or humor of any kind, terrible special effects that looked like they belonged in an old LooneyTunes cartoon,  darker tones than the musical play, forgettable performances, it ran far too long,  and the fight with the giant should've been seen to alot sooner rather than at the end.

In closing, If you still see a need to check it out for yourself/selves, well the best way to go about it is to check out the DVD for the musical play starring the lovely and talented Bernadette Peters first. You can get it the DVD here on Amazon.  That way you can make a decision based on its source material, and then see the movie to compare.  Perhaps you will see how the musical play is much better by far.",1427500800,13,6773,4.56255178127589
6863824,5,B00Q7WBGHG,Loved it. So much better than the stage version because of the technical advantages of film. No wooden cow or giant's foot. Meryl was great and should have received an Oscar.

6863826,5,B00Q7WBGHG,"Saw the original video recording of Into the Woods with Bernadette Peters after I saw this movie, and have to say that I liked this one better than the original Broadway show.  The acting, sets, costumes, songs were all wonderful, especially Emily Blunt as the Baker's Wife.

For all the people who gave it one star or hated it, they must have not known what the story was going to be like.  It's a little dark.  It's not a typical Disney movie with living happily ever after.  It's more for adults than children.

I was a little worried because I have wanted to see it for so long and didn't get a chance to see it in theaters. Well, I finally got to see it and I loved it. Everything about it was magical and beautiful. I loved how honest the stories were and how much they stuck to the real fairytales.  The visuals and costuming in this movie are unreal Done in a way only Disney can do. I was really worried that everything would be a little too much cgi like Alice in Wonderland, but they really didn't over do it and used the cgi in places the needed it. The characters are perfectly flawed and thought provoking. I would recommend this movie to anyone. Yes, it's a musical. Yes, there is a lot of singing. No, it does not end the way most Disney fairytales end. Please give it a chance though.",1427500800,3,944,4.125

6863835,4,B00Q7WBGHG,"As said by some of the other reviewers, yes, for the most part the music did all seem to be the same, at first. But there were a few truly magical pieces. And honestly, music aside, the movie was lovely! And had a marvelous message. In life, there is no such thing as happily ever after. But that's not the message... it's that, no matter how difficult it gets, you're ever truly alone. There's always help... if you want it. You just have to look and be opened to it. This movie took the fairytale endings and bathed the stories in a more realistic light. I loved that! So, if you can get past the one-note musical scores, I think you'll find a truly wonderful story hidden beneath. Just give it a chance! And by the way... Yes, Meryl Streep was AMAZING in the role of the witch. (I think she definitely rivaled Bernadette Peter's portrayal in the stage version. Not better, but equally good!)  But! I have to give props to Emily Blunt! I absolutely adored her in the role of the baker's wife! :)",1427500800,4,997,4.360215053763441
6863836,4,B00Q7WBGHG,"The biggest problem this Disney production has, is that Disney produced it.
This has led to all sorts of misconceptions about the story.

It is not a fairytale for children, was never meant to be.
Not necessarily happy endings, but conclusions to trials, and consequences to choices.
Symbolically represents adult themes. The challenges of good vs evil, compromise and justification.

It is a very clever adaptation of the stage production. (of which, I wasn't a fan)
It has a very talented cast.
The music and lyrics are very typical Sondheim, and therefore may be peculiar to those who are not familiar with musical theatre.

Overall, I found it entertaining.",1427414400,2,661,5.045871559633028

6863838,4,B00Q7WBGHG,"This is an adult fairy tale, a parable, a cautionary tale. Not for the kiddies, this one. But it's quite witty, cleverly weaving four fairy tales into one reasonably coherent story, and the music is good. Yes, it is a musical, people. Some songs are catchy, some forgettable, as with many musicals. There's a message here, delivered subtly, about the not so honorable ways we may go about getting what we wish for. And a lot of subtext about the relationships between parents and children. There were times towards the end when I teared up, and I'm not a weepy person. So there's sadness in the woods, and regret.
I'm not a big Meryl Streep fan, but she makes a great witch. Emily Blunt is lovely and convincing as the baker's wife. The majority of the cast are competent singers and fun to watch. Overall, more enjoyable than some reviews had led me to believe.",1427414400,6,862,4.567741935483871

So this movie, with it's tangled intertwining tales, was fascinatingly interesting.

6863844,5,B00Q7WBGHG,"Some of the one and two-star reviews on this site are pretty amusing.  A lot of folks seem to be expecting a Disney musical like Frozen or Mary Poppins...nope, this is a BROADWAY MUSICAL by STEPHEN SONDHEIM and people should know that going in.  Yes, there's going to be a lot of singing, and no, it's not for kids.  Sondheim musicals are complex and often dark.  Sweeney Todd, anyone?

That being said; I enjoyed this production much more than the Johnny Depp Sweeney Todd travesty, or the Gerard Butler Phantom of the Opera travesty.  This time they managed to cast actors who are not only great actors, but can actually sing Sondheim's difficult score.  I love the stage production (which is also available on DVD) and am looking forward to viewing it again soon for comparison' sake.  But I thought everyone in this (even Depp) acquitted themselves very well.  The final song, No One is Alone, brought me to tears, as it should.",1427414400,3,932,4.668711656441718

6863846,1,B00Q7WBGHG,"I consider viewing this entire movie as one of the great accomplishments in my life. And let me tell you, it wasn't an easy one. The only way I'd view this movie again would be at gun-point, and I'd be begging for the trigger pull within 10 minutes.

It's not even because it's a musicals.. I like musicals.. actually I love musicals! Well, I should say, I love enjoyable musicals. I so desperately wanted to like this movie. Even after the first song completed and my thought was thank god that song finally ended, I held on to hope for something better.

But it wasn't long before being assaulted once again.. and again.. and again. Like repeated blows to the cranium. It wasn't just the music, but the storyline. What some might call clever, I call clunky. Every fiber of the story felt forced and distorted. And it's not the grimm portions that bothered me, but rather the contrived twisting of these tales into this truly grim script.

Sorry to all you Sondheim fanatics, but this movie tortured me on so many points that I'm pretty sure I now suffer from PTSD.

When the movie was over my wife turned to me and said That's two hours we'll never get back. We hadn't muttered a single word, or groan of disgust, during the film. Nothing that would have influenced each other. We had to watch the 1982 version of Annie directly after this movie to try and scrub away the vile film of disgust coating our brains.

All that aside, I must say great cast. Can't blame the actors for an awful storyline and painful score.

Caveat: We could be suffering from a case of misdirected expectations. When you expect a spoonful of sugar and get one of salt, it's quite a shock. We had never heard the musical before and knew nothing other than this was a Disney fairy tail musical.",1427414400,17,1772,4.487577639751553

That said, we stuck throught it and liked the plot, but could live a long, long time without having to listen to the stupid songs again.  We've watched musicals before, and those were a mix of acting and singing.  This seems to be at least 3/4 or more song and narration.",1427414400,3,416,4.35064935064935
6863849,5,B00Q7WBGHG,"Well,  it finally happened; a Sondheim musical transfer from stage to screen with great results.  The negative reviews on this sight are merely from folks that just don t get it.  Mr Sondheim is not interested in relaying non truth in his musicals.  There is a beautiful message in this piece.  Every note of music advances character and plotline.  The music is complex.  It is a thinking mans movie.  It is a shame that we are programmed to expect films today to be violent, vulgar, riddled with sex and completely unrealistic with noise of explosions etc.  Here we  have great performances,  and all aspects of great film making.  No one said it was a children's film, at least not under 10.  It holds it s own as a film without taking away anything from the stage version;  a terrific accomplishment.  Let s see.

I would like to add the movie is rated PG with this said it had moments of being vulgar, violent, and showing indecent sexual humor which is not appropriate for children, the rating should definitely be higher. The film had great potential but it didn't reach its mark. The best part was johnny depp but he only lasts 2 minutes in the film and even his song seems very inappropriatly worded.

6863910,4,B00Q7WBGHG,"This is a good adaptation, but I have to admit I still prefer the one for the stage.  Into the Woods is basically broken into two parts.  Part One is based on the standard fairytales of Cinderella, Rapunzel, Jack and the Beanstalk, and Little Red Riding Hood.  Only, in this case, they are all intertwined as they take place in the same area and the characters run into each other and interact as they go ""into the woods"" to seek what they need.  The main driver is the story of the baker and his wife who have been cursed by their neighbor, the Witch, and have to seek out a series of items in order for the Witch to relent and uncurse them, allowing them to have a child.

Part Two of the story involves what happens after Happily Ever After, when the consequences of all their actions in Part One come home to roost.  The songs are terrific (though, difficult to sing I've heard) and, in this case, we actually get special effects instead of stage effects (which can be funnier).  All in all, this isn't quite as good as the stage version, so if you get a chance to see itsee it on stage.  This is NOT a childrens movie, as the stories are closer to the originals.  Streep does a great job as the Witch.  Johnny Depp is marvelous as the Wolf (definitely NOT for children).",1427328000,,1275,4.297071129707113

6863913,5,B00Q7WBGHG,"Into the Woods, adapted from the Broadway musical by Stephen Sondheim and James Lapine, is a beautifully crafted movie that intertwines several well known fairy tales and extends them intriguingly beyond the traditional accounts. Its clever blending of the characters into a new yet familiar tale adds a touch of irony to balance the sunny outcomes of their stories.

The baker (James Corden) and his wife (Emily Blunt) are a kindly couple making a modest living who long to have a family. Alas, that is not to happen. They have been cursed by a witch (Meryl Streep) because the bakers father stole vegetables from her garden.

But the witch is also miserable in her present ugly, hunched state and needs several items to undo the curse that made her so. She makes a deal with the baker and his wife: if they can bring her a cow as white as milk, a hank of hair as golden as corn, a golden slipper, and a red cloak, she will remove their curse.

The baker sets out alone into the woods in search of these four objects but is shortly joined by his insistent wife. On their quest, they encounter Jack (Daniel Huttlestone), Cinderella (Anna Kendrick), Little Red Riding Hood (Lilla Crawford), and Rapunzel (Mackenzie Mauzy), who conveniently have exactly the objects to satisfy the witch.

 As in most fairy tales, there has to be a prince, and this film has two  Cinderellas (Chris Pine) and Rapunzels (Billy Magnussen)  both devilishly handsome but lacking in sincerity and smarts, respectively.

 Lapines screenplay, based on his book for the Broadway musical, is a rich tapestry of colorful characters drawn with greater depth than in the fairy tales. Cinderella wants out from a slave-like existence with her stepmother (Christine Baranski), the baker and his wife long for a child of their own, Rapunzel wishes to be freed from her tower prison, Red Riding Hood wants to visit her dear grandmother, and young Jack seeks a way to extricate himself and his mother (Tracey Ullman) from a life of poverty. The film expands on the personalities of these stock characters, giving them depth and little twists that make them more richly human while maintaining the essential fantasy elements.

Director Rob Marshall (Chicago) knows his way around the movie musical, and his adaptation of the stage play is on the money. He and production designer Dennis Gassner have given the film the look of classic fairy tale illustrations, with dark, muted colors dominating. Writer Lapine has retained his original stage concept, using traditional versions as a jumping off point for this blended tale. Marshall uses computer-generated special effects with restraint, as a means to enhance the stories rather than as ends in themselves. A lot of big scenes rely largely on the audiences imagination, such as the giant crashing to the ground as the beanstalk is chopped down and Cinderellas coach turning into a pumpkin. Instead, his focus remains on the characters and their reactions to their predicaments. The best effects occur during the witchs entrances and exits, often equalling the impact of the Wicked Witch of the Wests comings and going in The Wizard of Oz, and are similarly essential to the character.

Once again, Meryl Streep etches an Academy Award-worthy performance. Shes a totally convincing witch, yet knows where a laugh lies in the dialogue and how to get it without mugging. Her singing voice is lovely and she adds genuine emotion to her songs.

A highlight of the film is the princes duet, Agony, in which Pine and Magnussen relate the burdens of princedom as they cavort over rocks in a gentle waterfall. The sequence shows off their bravado while revealing vulnerability and even trepidation at living up to what is expected of them.

Johnny Depp makes a brief but memorable appearance as the wolf that threatens Red Riding Hood as she travels through the dark, forbidding woods. His wolf is a charmer who has only one thing in mind  a hearty lunch! Depps make-up allows us to see his face clearly enough to enjoy  that wicked twinkle in his eyes. Hes quite the dapper carnivore, biding his time and calculating how to maximize his feast.

Movie musicals are uncommon these days. Its a pleasure to see that the filmmakers got this one right.",1427241600,,4253,4.886111111111111

6863921,5,B00Q7WBGHG,"Wow sums it up. Meryl Streep simply amazing! Emily Blunt equally as impressive. Tracey Ullman is back! I was happy to see Lucy Punch also, she's one of my favorite English actresses. I was surprised to see Daniel Huttlestone as Jack, he is going to be a big star someday. It was only missing James Callis and Helena Bonham-Carter. With this cast I felt it was a mix of Sweeney Todd and Les Miserable. However this movie is in its own category. The end shows what happens after ""Happily Ever After"".  I enjoyed this movies darkness and realism. It showed the price you pay marrying a prince, having a goose that lays golden eggs; ultimately what you give up to get what you want. Everyone pays, with a loss, some with their life. Meryl Streep says it best - ""something you love to something you lose"". when you go into the woods (which are ever changing) you become your true self, even if it shows the worst of humanity. I believe the value of the lessons in this movie far outweigh the average cookie cutter Disney movie. While probably more appropriate for older children, the whole Disney idea of happily ever after is irrelevant to life nowadays. The characters are so intertwined, turning on each other, blaming each other, reaching no resolve. Greed, lies, stealing, vengeance, all to get what they want. The characters have to confront who they really are, the movie takes you through each characters emotional struggle to accept themselves. Some characters don't realize - the Prince exclaims he was raised to be charming, not sincere. Ultimately there is a happy ending. The Baker is left with the upcoming generation, all having learned valuable lessons, and the Baker becomes the father he never had. Now that is a happy ending. bravo.",1427241600,7,1746,4.743421052631579

6863928,5,B00Q7WBGHG,"I have no clue why so many people have given this movie low ratings. If you have read anything or seen any of the interviews by the various cast members, you should know going in that the movie isn't a typical Disney fairy tale. It is dark, although not as dark as its Broadway counterpart, and is not going to have a happy ending. Although, in a way it did, just not the sort of happy ending one associates with a Disney tale.
The scenery is lush, even the peasant cottages are drab in a sumptuous way. The costumes are lush, especially Miss Streep's witch's gown is fabulous. In fact both the old and decrepit and young and beautiful versions were, by far, the most detailed and lush of the entire cast. The singing added to the story in a unique way in that it helped the story along. So often, the songs get annoying in a musical as it seems songs get added just to remind the audience that they are watching a musical.
Some of the actors I liked were: Meryl Streep, of course. James Corden, I enjoy his comedy, but the man has range, a really talented man. Johnny Depp, too bad he had such a small part, he was excellent. Anna Kendrick made a wonderful Cinderella. Tracy Ullman, very talented woman we never get to see often enough. The two ""children"" Lilla Crawford and Daniel Huttlestone , incredibly talented, I hope we see more of them. In fact the whole cast did a wonderful job.
All in all, the story line was unique, the songs kept the plot moving along and the actors played their parts well. I wish I could have seen the Broadway version, because I understand it was more adult oriented. Some of the consequences of the characters weren't as well defined as I understand they were in the original play. Still, its and excellent movie.",1427241600,9,1748,4.414860681114551

The parts that were rumored were integral to the overall plot, theme, moral of the musical, so my expectations were, admittedly, low.  However, I was pleasantly surprised to find the rumors were false.  Overall, the movie stays true to the original.  There are some tweaks, a few things are toned down a bit, a couple songs were left out, but nothing drastic enough to take away from the plot or message.  I did enjoy it, much more than I thought I would, and I think that fans of the original Broadway musical would enjoy this as well.",1427155200,14,797,4.387755102040816

The music wasn't very good; the actors didn't have singing voices; there was very little humor---how ""Into the Woods"" could have been on Broadway for longer than opening night I'll never know.  It is certainly not for children and I am surprised that someone at Disney gave the approval to produce this film with the Disney name attached.  Merle Streep is a good actress but this is the second bomb I've seen her in and even her talent could not save this awful film.

6863936,5,B00Q7WBGHG,"I had never seen Into The Woods before, either the Bernadette Peters film version or any stage version, but it's clear from reading many of the reviews that people didn't know what movie they were expecting to see, were not expecting to see a musical or are unfamiliar with Sondheim's style.

The songs were pretty much all lifted straight from the stage version of the show.  I can understand people being irked that certain elements such as the Narrator or the Agony reprise were left out, but if you didn't like it for the sole reason that you saw something else than you were expecting, the fault lies with yourself, NOT the film as this is not exactly a new production.  You could have easily educated yourself first before shelling out the money to see it in the theaters.

I loved this movie.  I bought the soundtrack immediately afterwards.  I can understand why some people didn't, but judge it on it's merits rather than because you saw something you weren't expecting to see.

This movie has some how pulls off all the singing with out being overly irritating.  I enjoyed it, which I found very surprising.  The movie is about the choices people make, and the consequences they reap.  That is a good subject to write about, although one scene with the bakers wife is not in my view appropriate for kids.  I watched this movie with my kids and they were rather confused on why certain actions happened.  Not a conversation I wanted to have yet.  One other scene of the movie I found just onerously to watch was the singing princes.  Gosh what a horrible scene and incredibly boring.  Nearly died of boredom, but luckily it was over in about an hour or two.  The lyrics were witty, and the singing not too bad.

6863950,4,B00Q7WBGHG,"I was surprised to see that more than 52,000 readers at the Internet Movie Database collectively rated Disneys Into the Woods a mere 6.2 out of 10. And at Rotten Tomatoes, only 53 percent of some 85,000 viewers liked it.  Obviously, these were people more familiar with the Disney formula than the Broadway musical penned by Stephen Sondheim and James Lapine, because the film version stays pretty true to the theatrical production.

In fact, despite the addition of greater visual depth and special effects, Disneys Into the Woods has a very staged feel to it, except that the actors aren't consciously playing to the audience. Were not talking about the insertion of occasional songs, either. Like an operetta, Into the Woods features plenty of monologues and conversations that are sung rather than spoken. Its a very theatrical film, in other words, and I can see where, if you're not expecting that, it could throw you for a loop.

So could the encroachment of serious themes and an ending that undercuts the fairytale notion of happily-ever-after. You and your family may find yourself tearing up, and thats almost unheard of with a Disney film. In the past, there may have been weepy Bambis mother and Old Yeller moments, but all was usually well that ended well. Theres a difference between a happy ending and a hard-earned optimism that reinforces the old adage about making lemonade when life gives you lemons, and its the latter that audiences encounter when they travel vicariously Into the Woods.

Disneys film version may be rated PG, but the emotional content may make the film appropriate only for children old enough to understand and accept what was repackaged in The Lion King as The Circle of Life. If they can handle The Lion King, they can handle this. But they have to love live theater and musicals to love Disneys Into the Woods. Its that simple. They also need to be able to understand the basic premise, which is an intricate weave of familiar fairytales.

Everybody wants something, which is what the cast sings about in the long, opening title song that begins, I Wish. It might help to share ahead of time with smaller children that Into the Woods is a mash-up of fairytales, and that we jump from tale to tale and character to character.

The Baker (James Corden) and his wife (Emily Blunt) desperately want a child, and the witch next door who had put a curse on their family (Meryl Streep in her Oscar-nominated role) offers them a way to do that:  they must bring her a milky white cow (from the Jack and the Beanstalk fairytale), a slipper of gold (from the Cinderella fairytale), a blood-red cape (from the Red Riding Hood fairytale), and hair as yellow as corn (from the Rapunzel fairytale).

All the characters go into the woods:  Jack (Daniel Huttlestone) is sent by his mother (Tracy Ullman) to sell the cow, Cinderella (Anna Kendrick) goes there to talk to her dead mother and receive the gift of fine clothes that will allow her to attend the ball, Little Red (Lilla Crawford) skips to her grandmothers house deep in the woods, Rapunzel (Mackenzie Mauzy) rebels against her witchy mother by secretly seeing a prince, the baker and his wife try to acquire their objects, and the giant and giants wife from Jack and the Beanstalk eventually wreak havoc.

Thats the plot. The story is more complicated. Its about what it means to have children, to be a mother or father, to raise those children, and to let go of them. Its about how difficult it is to sustain those first-act happy endings throughout life. And its about coping with the loss of loved ones. So you can see where, if people entering the theater think they're going to see another formulaic Disney movie, Into the Woods will seem more complex, both in terms of the plot and the emotions it evokes.

Much has been made of Johnny Depps lecherous (and I might add, delicious) portrayal of the Wolf, dressed in 40s attire, but hes only onscreen for a short scene and aside from a few suggestive remarks that will go right over the heads of youngsters theres nothing inappropriate. Theres nothing graphic about the terror of the giants, either. And while Ive spent time talking about the serious or sad elements, Into the Woods also has a lot of funny moments.

Mostly, though, its a musical, and the music won a Tony Award for Best Score. Director Rob Marshall (Chicago) does a terrific job of adapting the play for the big screen, and his handling of the musical numbers is one of the films strengths. In some cases Marshalls version is an improvement, as when Cinderellas prince (Chris Pine) meets Rapunzels prince (Billy Magnussen) in the woods and they sing a duet by a waterfall about the Agony of loving difficult-to-win women.

I was surprised to see that the filmed performance of the Broadway version is rated higher at Amazon than the Disney version. To my way of thinking, the cast and singing are just as strong, and the Disney version will hold more appeal for young viewers. If your family likes musicals, this is a good one for family movie night.

Blu-ray is the way to go on this title, as it looks spectacular in HD and with a 7.1 sound mix to fill your home theater.

Language:  N/A
Sex:  N/A
Violence:  Worst is probably the cutting off of the stepsisters toe and heel, with no cutting depicted but blood shown
Adult situations:  Some suggestive talk in the Wolfs seduction scene et alia

It should have clearly stated in big letters based on a ""Stephen Sondheim musical"" and hence you wouldn't have had at least half the complaints on this movie. That said for a musical is not all that entertaining, the songs are not memorable in my opinion, the story goes into so many places with no satisfying ending. It looks like it's trying to be a kid's movie, a musical or an adult fantasy movie about fairy tales but it fails on all levels. I had to laugh when Cinderella's husband the Prince kissed the Baker's wife and said well anything happens in the woods and when he explained the incident to Cinderella he merely said he was raised to be charming not sincere, oh yeah really likable guy right there!

6863957,1,B00Q7WBGHG,This movie was torture to watch and listen to. The trailer seriously made it seem like it was suppose to be this magical story but it was so bad that at the end of the movie I was so mad at myself for allowing myself  and my daughter to sit through the whole movie. The only reason I watched the whole thing was because I was hoping it would get better and it kept getting worse. My daughter and I were literally yelling at the TV because we couldn't stand the repeated singing. That's all they did and repeated the same lines over and over. They sang for every little thing. They could step on a leaf and that would lead to an endless song with the same three lines.

The second it ended, one of us said RUN FOR YOUR LIVES! We did, and so did most of the audience.  Worst. Movie. Ever.",1426291200,16,437,4.395061728395062
6863959,1,B00Q7WBGHG,"This movie was just plain terrible and I had such high hopes for it. Now where to begin, I guess since its a musical the music... All of it except for a few and I mean a few songs seemed way to similar and honestly there felt like there was way to much singing. I swear they hardly ever stopped, I like musicals but you do not have to sing literally everything in one.

Now the story was just awful I kept waiting for it to get better and in the second act I nearly thought it would get better I figured they were going ""the story's paths have crossed/switched route but instead they just threw the only interesting thing they could have done out the window and then kill off the Witch stupidly in the actual arc. So what is the actual story? Basically you follow the Baker as he doesn't interact with the other characters stories  in literally the most boring way possible. The only story that you actually get to see occur really is Cinderella but you don't get the high point of the ball instead you get the original gory story of Cinderella. I'll give them credit for that but it's a small one seeing as it really doesn't help much and brings up another problem with the movie...its not a kids film. Besides the gory Cinderella parts Johnny Depp (who was only in the movie for a tiny tiny portion despite the commercials) is made to act like a  pedo-wolf. Yes I realize the original had ties to a sexual nature but watching that performance was a tad disturbing especially when you think of the kids watching. Now besides the previously mentioned characters Red was annoying and Cinderella's prince was just awful...I'm sorry I find Chris Pine to be hot what they did to his looks in this movie when he's a bloody Prince is criminal and is you add that to what is character is  then to me at least you get the worst character of all.

Overall again it was just awful and the two hours I wasted watching it I kept hoping it would get better...it never did.  Do not put yourself through the same long long torture, because the two hours felt like 5, and instead do anything else.",1426204800,5,2081,4.350515463917525
6863960,1,B00Q7WBGHG,"This by far has to be one of the worst films I've ever seen....I've literally been sitting here for ten minutes after typing that first sentence trying to figure out where to even begin describing how ghastly this movie is...

I suppose I'll start with the plot..what is it exactly? There is really only one set of characters in the whole film who have a story that sort of makes sense but is definitely lacking in back story.

Every single character is dull, lifeless, and unlikable.

All of the best parts of the fairy tales are taken out of the movie. For example, all you get to see of Cinderella is her leaving the ball which I thought was stupid, you never get to see Jack climb the bean stalk and discover the giants etc. Why would you cut out the best parts of a story?! I get that it would take a long time to show all of that, but this was a long movie in general or at least it seemed to be because of how boring and pointless it was. I would have at least liked something pretty to look at.

The songs are stupid and I honestly can't even remember any specific one because none of them were very catchy. I barely even noticed the actual music because it was pretty much tuneless and it basically just sounded like people were singing their dialogues while looking around excitedly at nothing. What is the point of making a movie a musical if there isn't choreography to go along with the music, or at least something interesting to look at? I don't mind watching someone sing for one or two numbers while they act out a song with their eyes but god does that get boring after the first ten times. I'm watching a movie...I want to SEE something visual.

The end was ridiculous and made absolutely no sense, not to mention you never get to find out what happens with the other characters. They seem to just sort of disappear.

I can't believe Meryl Streep was nominated for an Academy Award for this turkey of a film when she has starred in and given waaaaay better performances in basically every other movie she's ever been in. It must have taken everything in her not to hang her head in shame at the award ceremony.

I could honestly go on and on about how awful this film was but I'm sure you get the message by now. Pass on this movie!",1426204800,9,2251,4.307328605200945

INTO the WOODS cleverly intermeshes several well-known fairy tales, adding some nice flourishes:  A brash and gutsy Red Riding Hood, a cockney-speaking Jack of the Beanstalk, and a handsome, charming, yet philandering prince. Those who generally like this sort of thing will probably find IW worth seeing. There's also plenty of meaning if that's what you're after. A few other noteworthy lines: ""Are you certain that your wish is what you want?""; ""You're not good, you're not bad, you're just nice""; ""Even flowers have their dangers""; and, "" `I shall always love the girl who ran away'--`And I, the faraway prince.' "" Nice performances by just about everyone, but especially Meryl Streep as the Witch, Lilla Crawford as Red Riding Hood, Anna Kendrick as Cinderella, and David Huttlestone as Jack.

The biggest problem is that IW may prove too draggy--it would have benefitted from being 15-20 minutes shorter--and complicated for many younger audiences, too tame and cutesy for many older ones. This film takes place in a kingdom whose citizens sing about 75% of what they say to the same old loud-rhyming riff, making it distractingly seem like a parody of a bad stage musical; the script is so much better in the remaining 25% where they speak in normal fashion. Although IW is truly funny in a few places, it tries just a bit too hard in that area, and the humor is often forced. Some nice visuals, but it's not up to Disney's usual standards. The creators of this film had a difficult and ambitious project on their hands; regardless, IW lacks both the cohesive plot and the emotional impact of something like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Maleficent-1-Disc-DVD/dp/B00M4ADWQ8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Maleficent (1-Disc DVD)</a>.

Oh, well. If you find the rest of the film at least watchable, you will probably find the very, very end well-worth getting to. I also have to admire the way this film addresses the mortality of its characters.",1426204800,3,2007,5.242990654205608
6863962,5,B00Q7WBGHG,"As I post this review there are about 99 reviews posted here.  (I guess that makes me #100). Even though they say they are of the BD or DVD versions (in the title), all that I see are based on the theatrical version. The home video versions will be released on March 24th but I was provided an advance screener of the BD Combo package and wanted to share the info on those - for those considering the home video package. You should also be aware that Amazon has a policy that combines ALL reviews of ALL formats (theatrical, streaming DVD and BD) together under each format. So, I always recommend that you sort reviews by date (most recent) and then note the format being reviewed. With that said, on to my review.

First, I'm just briefly say that I enjoyed the film even though there were changes made to the stage version. The changes obviously were made in the libretto since the stage music ran for 2  hours (plus intermission) while the film is just two-hours and five minutes. So some ""plot lines were cut and some new Sondheim songs were added.  If you haven't seen the stage versions, you won't notice this.  I'll also say that this may be a Disney film but it can be dark and scary to young children. It is rated PG.

On to the voluminous ""Bonus Features"" - especially the BD ones.
The DVD contains  just ONE Bonus - a seven minute featurette ""Magic of the Woods"" which is actually one of the four segments from the ""Deeper In The Woods"" featurette on the BD release. (More on that in a minute).

For the BD Disney added LOTS of bonuses - though some do seem repetitive. First there is a full length Director's Commentary (which, honestly, I haven't watched yet). Next comes the aforementioned four-part ""Deeper in the Woods (it's 29 minutes in total) which discusses the scenery, makeup, costumes and more). Next is the Sondheim-penned song ""She'll Be Back"" which was deleted from the film. It runs about five-minutes but half of it is director Rob Marshall's intro. It's performed by Meryl Streep as the Witch.

""There's Something About The Woods"" is another 13-minute featurette featuring all the cast members as well as the creative team.  The cast is also featured in interviews in the 10-minute ""The Cast as Good As Gold"" (which like the other features using clips from the film).  Next-to-lastly there is a feature titled ""Music & Lyrics"" which allows you to jump directly to ""song segments"" in this mostly sung-through film and have the option of singing along with the words on the screen. And, yes, it includes the full 16-minute opening ""Prologue""!  A nice feature.

I said ""next-to-last"" above because the press  release says that there are ""5 Easter Eggs"". I haven't taken the time to find them, so I'll let others clue you in on how to find them. There is so much extra material on this release that you will busy for hours and hours! Hence, I recommend that anyone who loves the musical or the film should spring for the BD version vs. the DVD.

 I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

If you came with young children and were upset with how dark it was, you should have done your homework first.  A quick google search would have shown you this wasn't for you.

As for those who say the music and lyrics are awful - I don't know what to say to you.  This is one of Sondheim's best scores, and he is universally acknowledged to be a master of the American Musical Theater.  Some of his work is difficult and inaccessible, but not ""Into The Woods"".

To me, the reason I left them with Grandma wasn't so much the nature of the film, but more that it wouldn't interest them. This isn't a movie with catchy little songs that you can sing over and over after one viewing. Sondheim is hard to sing, but brilliant. The actors (especially Anna Kendrick) were really impressive.

6863999,5,B00Q7WBGHG,"We have loved Into the Woods for years.  We have a DVD of the original stage cast.  When our daughter was small, we stopped the play before the second part - while everything was still happily ever after.  It was not child appropriate and neither is the movie.  We saw the movie on Christmas Eve and were horrified at the number of families with small children attending the movie.  Yes it is Disney, but it is not a family movie.  We think it should have been rated PG-13.

They left a couple of songs out of the movie, the most important being ""No More"".  I think if you know this song, the story and its message make more sense.

The first part is a fun twisting of fairy tells.  The second teaches that happily ever after doesn't really exist.  There are many messages in the story.  There is a fair amount of darkness and death.  There are good messages and bad.

The movie is overall true to the play.  The music is mostly intact.  The actors did a good job.  If you have complaints about the story, blame the writer, Sondheim, not Disney.  They mostly followed his script.

Sondheim may not be for everyone.  Some of his work is twisted.  We like a lot of his work and love this one.",1423958400,12,1190,4.294117647058823

Remember that one? It's the first song that launches this perennial stage musical. I have seen it numerous times, most recently a spectacular version in Ashland, Oregon, staged at the Shakespearean Festival.

Now it passes into the capable hands of Rob Marshall (""Chicago"") who is someone we can trust with a well-loved musical. He did it right! The first act evokes familiar childhood stories, ""Little Red Riding Hood,"" ""Jack and the Beanstalk,"" ""Cinderella,"" and ""Rapunzel,"" with The Baker and His Wife woven in for continuity. It's constructed as a sort of scavenger hunt. Of course that's the part where they all live ""happily ever after."" The next section is what happens AFTER the ""happily ever after."" (Composer Stephen Sondheim MUST be in therapy!)

A stage musical this well known draws out musical theater fans. It was fun to hear the screening audience applaud after a song, much like we would do in ""live"" theater. The actors not only articulated like stage actors, the sound engineering is terrific! No murmuring, no whispers and no missed dialogue. Whew! This is important because much of the music contains witty lyrics.

Here is part of this huge, capable cast:
  * Lilla Crawford (TV Host) Red Riding Hood skips happily into the woods to Grandmother's house but she's a little bit scared.
  * Johnny Depp (""Lucky Them"") The Wolf teaches Red Riding Hood a valuable lesson when he finds her in the woods. ""Hello, little girl!""
  * Anna Kendrick (""Pitch Perfect"") Cinderella will be just fine, if the birds keep helping her.
  * Christine Baranski (""The Good Wife"") Cinderella's Stepmother will go to any lengths to find the perfect husband...for her less- than-perfect daughters.
  * Chris Pine (""Star Trek"") Cinderella's Prince is a charming fellow.... He has my favorite punch line.
  * Meryl Streep (""August: Osage County"") The Witch is packing a lot of malice and in her mind it's justified. It's not HER fault!
  * Mackenzie Mauzy (Lots of TV) Lonely Rapunzel knows that she wants... something ...and it isn't just visits from her mother, the Witch, so she sings a haunting melody.
  * Billy Magnussen (""Boardwalk Empire"") Rapunzel's Prince is in agony when the one thing he wants is the thing he can't have.
  * James Corden (""Begin Again"") The Baker wants a son...period! But he's not sure how to be a father. He's not good; he's not bad; he's just nice.
  * Emily Blunt (""Edge of Tomorrow"") The Baker's Wife can't understand why she has never had a baby, so she believes The Witch's story. It takes two....
  * Daniel Huttlestone (Gavroche in ""Les Miserables"") is Jack, who traded his beloved Milky White for a handful of beans.
  * Tracey Ullman (""How I Met Your Mother"") Jack's Mother is at her wit's end trying to raise such a simple boy.

This two-hour, PG-rated collaboration between Disney, Lucamar and Marc Platt Productions depicts fairy tales, so expect some computer generated imaging but no sweaty bodies or profanity. Each actor has his or her moment in the spotlight and each one shines! It would be impossible to pick a favorite actor, scene, song or situation, although Chris Pine and Emily Blunt are perfectly cast! ...and that waterfall bit is delicious.... ...and Wyatt Smith's editing for ""It's Your Fault"" is lickety-split... and... Stop me or I'll go on and on and on...

I like the message, ""Be careful what you wish for...""",1423785600,16,3382,4.8927943760984185

When I was 10 I sang I know things now for my voice lessons. I saw the play when I was 11 and just now at 28 found out there was a video recording of it! I actually bought the Broadway play and watched it after this.
I NOW HAVE 3 FAVORITE LIVE ACTION DISNEY WITCHES ACTRESSES: Susan Sarandon, Jean Marsh, and Meryl Streep!

VERDICT:
yes, disney changed some things, but I honestly thought the major changes made the characters seem more realistic. It thought it was better to have only one Prince cheat on his wife only one time. It made him seem more capable of learning his lesson when cinderella broke up with him. Rapunzel marrying the prince, who is faithful to her, and proving to the Witch that she was perfectly capable taking care of herself was better than her going insane.

especially since Disney's last two live action films have portrayed men as scumbags (Oz the great and Powerful and Maleficent). Maybe they should have forgone those films (neither was an improvement over their previous stories Sleeping Beauty and Return to Oz) and done into the woods as it was on Broadway.
But I like what they did",1423353600,10,1137,4.514563106796117
6864004,2,B00Q7WBGHG,"Very disappointed. Even the formidable Meryl Streep wasn't able to redeem this over-disneyfied version, it was an insurmountable cliff. Why would something written for adults (to include thoughtful young adults) need to have the juice sucked out of it? Such a pity. Making the production insipid enough to approach Disney animations is like trying to fit a beefy foot into Cinderella's glass slipper. So-called fairy tales were originally dark for a reason--they included real-life conflict. The original Broadway version is so worth seeing, but this review is not about Broadway snobbery. I've also seen this performed twice by different community theatre companies, all far superior to the film version. That said, of course Streep is a treat in any endeavor. The high point of the film came with Chris Pine's wry sibling rivalry in the ""Agony"" number, well staged and quite humorous.",1423353600,4,886,5.246478873239437

6864008,5,B00Q7WBGHG,"After reading so many mixed reviews and especially the negative ones, I feel I need to write my own.  I am a theatre geek and saw the original run of this show 8 times.  I LOVED it.  This show came along after my parents retired to Myrtle Beach, and I stayed in NJ.  My sister had just been diagnosed with MS.  I understood its purpose.  I have seen a number of community theatre productions and have played The Baker in a community theatre production.  My wife and I joke that ""If you lie in act one, you die in act two.""  The point of this show/movie is what happens ""Happily Ever After,"" cause and effect.  I was concerned when I heard that Disney was producing the film and that it may turn into a dumbed down version of ONCE UPON A TIME.  However, I was very surprised.  Yes, things were cut from the show.  Why?  Because things which can be done in a film close-up cannot be done onstage, and since this is a musical, are done with a song.  Stephen Sondheim is a wordsmith and songs in this movie as with the show, have truths in them.  The characters are Jungian archetypes and should not have nuisanced emotions, except for the five that grow; The Baker, Little Red, Cinderella, Jack, and The Witch.  I could say that The Baker's Wife also grows as a character, but alas she lied in act one, so...

Years ago, that part which really got to me was in the end when The Baker said, ""How will I go about being a father with no one to mother my child.""  Now that I have twin granddaughters age 12, it was The Witch singing ""Stay With Me.""  The focus shifted as I have grown.

This show/movie was Sondheim's next project after SUNDAY IN THE PARK WITH GEORGE.  SITPWG hints at these truths with the song ""Children and Art.""  In that show, Marie, a 98 year old grandmother, states that the only things we leave behind are children and art, it's our legacy.  Stephen Sondheim understands all of this!  That is why these musicals are masterpieces.

Just as a side note, the music editors, music supervisor, and long time Sondheim orchestrator Jonathan Tunick did a great job adding strains of A LITTLE NIGHT MUSIC and SWEENEY TODD into the background scoring.",1423180800,9,2157,4.4
6864009,4,B00Q7WBGHG,"Theatrical film review. Just like the Tony award winning Broadway production, the movie version is messy, with plotlines, unlikely coincidences and other head scratchers. But I didn't go to this movie for a reality check. I came for Stephen Sondheim's music and lyrics. Director Rob Marshall is no stranger to musicals and here he sticks with the basics that appeared on Broadway. Sure the sets are more elaborate as are the special effects. But this movie won't be confused with a big blockbuster in spite of its $50 million budget. I suspect much of that went to the cast. And it's a good one.

In this mishmash of fairy tales, James Corden and Emily Blunt star as The Baker and The Baker's wife. Unable to have children thanks to a spell placed on them by their neighbor, The Witch (a splendid Meryl Streep). The Witch is under a spell of her own which took away here beauty. Cinderella is played by Anna Kendrick. She's wanting to go to the ball which here lasts for 3 nights. With the help of her singing birds she does and meets the handsome prince (Chris Pine). Other characters include Jack (as in ""the beanstalk"") played by Daniel Huttlestone, Little Red Riding Hood (Lilla Crawford), The Wolf (Johnny Depp), Repunzel (Mackenzie Mauzy), her prince (Billy Magnussen), Jack's mum (Tracey Ullman) and Cindy's mean stepmother (Christine Baranski).

Essentially the story centers around The Witch agreeing to lift the no-baby spell if the couple will collect 4 essential items that she needs to lift her own spell. They are a white cow, red cloak, corn-yellow hair and gold slippers. So now you get it, right? What has always given me cause for a chuckle in this story, are some of the below the radar adult themes. Starting with The Wolf's eyeballing Red and perhaps not just because she would be good to eat. And then there is the probable adultery between The Baker's Wife and Cindy's prince. It's nothing overt so kiddies and some adults won't even notice.

As far as the music, everyone does a terrific job with their songs, and there are many to spread around. I'm never surprised anymore by how well actors can hold a tune. While I'm sure there are technical enhancements needed now and again, the actor/singer's do the music proud. And that's what I came for.",1422835200,8,2271,4.72979797979798

Whether this or Sweeney Todd, they are almost entirely sung.  That's his style.  Get over it!  The movie is not overly long, because it leaves out several songs from the original musical.  Paul Gemignani is the conductor here, as he was on Broadway.  On B-way, he conducts ""Ever After"" so fast it resembles Gilbert and Sullivan.  Here it is relegated to a celebratory scene of Cinderella and the Prince getting married, and the tempo is much better.  Also cut are the Farewell to Milky White the cow (which is too bad, because the Jack is really good.  The other songs cut are the Agony reprise, and No More (played beautifully by the orchestra over a spoken scene).  The problem with the stage play is that act two feels tediously long.  It is the other side of the ""happy ever after.""  Cutting Agony reprise means the Princes don't start flirting with Snow White and Sleeping Beauty (who don't appear, and simply confuse the audience.).  By the way, Francis de la Tour is hardly seen as the giantess, but she has played a giant before.  She is Olympe in the Harry Potter movies.  A marvelous British actress.  Meryl Streep does a lot more than phone her performance in!  She is stunning, singing better than most of us remember she can.  The whole cast is excellent.  Some complain that Red Riding Hood and Jack (with the Beanstalk) are too young, and that the sexual overtones don't come through.  Maybe they do but they don't hit us over the head.

Instead the original plot is lost in a menagerie of disjointed songs that make no sense with a few elements of surprise thrown in. I sat through the whole movie hoping it would get better but it didn't. Some of the surprise moments would definitely scare younger children and cause nightmares.

To me it was just plain boring and dark and made no sense at all. The characters were completely without feeling and I couldn't give a hoot about what their fates were. In fact, I didn't even understand what they were really aiming for, except for the baker and his wife. Nobody seems to have a real goal or objective.

They all seem completely disoriented and just kept knocking into one another in the woods. What's the real message behind it all? Is there one at all? I was bored out of my wits and wished and wished for it to be over. Felt like the longest movie ever. Like we sat there for 4 hours.

6864017,4,B00Q7WBGHG,"This movie version of the Stephen Sondheim Broadway musical is loyal to the original, losing only a couple of songs (Broadway musicals are longer than movies, so the cuts were necessary) and gaining a sumptuous setting and special effects that can't be matched by live theater.

If you're not familiar with the musical, look it up. It's a bit controversial, since it's closer--much closer--to the original Grimm fairy tales than anything Disney would dare produce. Here wolves do indeed eat little girls and their grandmothers. Here ugly stepsisters do indeed cut off their toes to try to fit into a glass slipper so they can live a life of royal luxury. Here little boys do indeed befriend and then rob giants in the sky. And here people are generally punished for their transactions in the severest of ways. Although the words ""All will come to a happy end"" are spoken at the beginning, by the end we see that's not true for most. But there is still a light at the very end. The characters who do survive are stronger and wiser for it. They have their stories and their storyteller, and they have each other.

The performances are all excellent. Meryl Streep plays the witch who ties all the tales together. The baker and his wife are unable to have children, and the witch explains it's because she put a curse on the baker's father after he looted her garden to bring food to his then pregnant wife. To make amends and remove the curse, the baker must bring the witch Cinderella's slipper, Red Riding Hood's cape, Jack's white cow, and hair the color of corn, like Rapunzel's. The couple must venture into the woods, as do all the other major characters, to get what they want. And bad things, scary things, revealing things happen in the woods.

While the musical explores some of the darker sides of fairy tales as they were originally written hundreds of years ago, some modern themes emerge. Little Red Riding Hood's story turns into a coming-of-age tale as she first finds the Wolf both exciting and terrifying but eventually comes to realize how dangerous talking to strangers can be. And there's a reason why Cinderella runs away from the ball that has nothing to do with a spell that stops at midnight. At first she doesn't realize what that reason is, but she's a smart girl, and she eventually figures it out. Sometimes a prince can be a bit too charming.

Into the Woods is beautiful and dark and heartbreaking. There are some funny moments. All the performances are excellent. I liked the movie very much and think it deserves four stars. I would recommend it to teenagers and adults who enjoy musicals and aren't afraid of dark stories.

I can't give it five stars, though, since some parts are slow, some not as deep and affecting as they should be (Jack, for example, shows no remorse for what he's done to the people he calls the ""big tall terrible awesome scary wonderful giants in the sky"") and it does bother me that Rapunzel's story ends way before the others and doesn't really have a solid ending, although it is rare a happy one. (I suppose that makes sense, in a way, since she ventures out of, not into, the woods.) Some of the characters are redeemed, while others are not, and it seems rather random. But even those who never make it out of the woods alive remain in the memories of the survivors, and in their stories. Their ghosts have lessons to teach. I think that's the part I enjoyed the most.

So if you like Broadway musicals, excellent performances, and dark, very dark fairy tales with a modern twist, I think you're going to like this movie version of Into the Woods.",1422489600,10,3609,4.613707165109035

6864019,5,B00Q7WBGHG,"Ok, I have seen a lot of bad reviews of this movie, and I'll be honest, it's not for everyone. I would caution letting a very young child watch it, but my eight year old loved it! I don't know if I would recommend it to anyone younger than that. Many characters do die and some parts may be frightening.
  That being said, I think some people just don't understand some things about this film. I have heard a lot of people see the wolf character as some kind of sick child abuser. Ummmm... he's a wolf. An actual wolf with pointy ears and a tail. He literally wants to eat Little Red Riding Hood. Could it be taken the wrong way? Absolutely. And are there some other things that are implied? Maybe. But you have to remember, it's a fairy tale. He's a wolf!
  There are some scenes that are pretty violent and dark for a""Disney"" movie, but they all go by the original fairy tales, really. The part where the step sisters try on the slipper makes me cringe, but that's how the real story goes.  And the originals get even worse than that!  And think about how many characters actually die in all those""happy"" Disney movies. How many Disney movies can you name where all the parents make it out alive?
  Like I said, this movie may not be for everyone, but we thought it was very funny and the music was great! The characters are perfect and the acting was outstanding.

6864021,5,B00Q7WBGHG,"Into the Woods debuted on Broadway in October 1987, where it was greeted with great enthusiasm by critics and audiences alike.  The narrative is based on four fairy tales, using versions by the Brothers Grimm (Cinderella, Jack and the Beanstalk, Little Red Riding Hood and Rapunzel).  The plot blends the familiar tales with an original story about a baker and his wife and their attempts to undo a witch's spell.  The musical boasts music and lyrics by Stephen Sondheim, the most respected theatre composer of the last 60 years, and a book by his frequent collaborator, James Lapine.

Historically, fairy tales by the Grimm Brothers have been viewed as being darker and more realistic than versions of the same stories written by other authors.  Consequently, and because Mr. Sondheim is seen as one of the most (if not the most) challenging composers of modern theatre, it must be noted that Into the Woods is not a piece that was conceived with an audience of young children in mind.  Rather, it is a sophisticated adult experience, a fairy tale for grownups if you will.  While some of the darker and more provocative aspects of the story have been muted for the film version, the fact that the film has been produced by Disney has led many parents to assume that this is a film for small children.  It is not.  It is a moral fable for grownups; most children under the age of fifteen or so (unless they are very mature) will not be able to appreciate the story, and many parents of small children will find the material unsuitable.

For the uninitiated, Mr. Sondheim has long been known for his extremely clever rhymes, and his intellectually provocative lyrics and scenarios.  Since 1957, he has written lyrics and later both music and lyrics for such heralded shows as West Side Story, Gypsy, A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum, Anyone Can Whistle, Do I Hear A Waltz, Company, Follies, A Little Night Music, Merrily We Roll Along, Sweeney Todd, Pacific Overtures, Sunday in the Park with George, Assassins, Passion, Bounce and, of course, Into the Woods.  Whole revues have been assembled around his songs and even the songs he'd dropped from shows before they reached Broadway.  Nevertheless, aside from the score to West Side Story and his most successful song, Send in the Clowns, he is largely unknown to all but regular Broadway audiences.  Yet many audiences are already familiar with the stage version of Into the Woods, either from Broadway, touring companies or the DVD of the complete show (with the original cast).  Like most of Sondheim's other works, Into the Woods has been praised for its witty and intelligent lyrics and its extremely humorous book.  It has also proved to be one of his most popular endeavors.

Devotees of the stage work will find that, like Sweeney Todd before it, several cuts have been made in the story and music for the film version of Into the Woods.  Having purchased the soundtrack and now having seen the film twice, I would say that about one third of the story and one fifth of the music has been removed from the film version.  I was a bit more disappointed at the deletions of the choral portions of Sweeney Todd than I am in the music cut from Into The Woods.  The film works quite well, with a good deal of the music and humor intact.

The following songs have been deleted from the score for the movie:

I Guess This is Goodbye / Maybe They're Magic
First Midnight
Act II Prologue (So Happy)
Agony (Act II Reprise)

And the following songs have been replaced by instrumental versions:

Ever After (Instrumental)
No More (Instrumental)

This is not surprising; what is surprising is that so much of the score has been retained for the film.  The original stage show ran over three hours, plus the intermission.  The film clocks in at just over two hours, which means that more than an hour of music and plot have been trimmed.  Many may disagree, but I believe this makes for a tighter, more structured story and score.  Considering the length of the stage work, some cuts simply had to be made.

It is recommended that those previously unfamiliar with the score acquire the complete soundtrack (with the libretto included) and follow along with the words as the songs are sung.  The first thing you will realize is (as with any of Mr. Sondheim's works) how incredibly witty and sophisticated the lyrics are; on first listen you may miss most of his delicious wit.  His use of the language, his clever rhymes, and his intelligent, deft semantics will amaze anyone who takes the time to listen.  There are reasons why so many consider Sondheim the foremost composer of the theatre, and so many intelligent theatergoers hang on his every word.  Into the Woods is no exception, despite the cuts.

The cast of the film, led by Meryl Streep, Anna Kendrick and James Corden are uniformly excellent.  I expected a faithful adaptation of Into the Woods as soon as I heard that the film was being directed by Rob Marshall, who brought the musical Chicago to the screen.  Mr. Marshall presented a faithful adaptation of Chicago, and once again he does not disappoint.

All in all, Into the Woods is a towering achievement.  Few of Sondheim's musicals have been successfully transplanted to cinema.  Into the Woods may very well be the best of them.

Highly recommended.",1422403200,14,5327,4.728060671722644

6864024,5,B00Q7WBGHG,"Don't pay attention to the low rate reviews, this is a fantastic movie that both adults and kids should see.  If you want a saccharine saturated fantasy with a happy ending you should look somewhere else.  Although this movie starts as a typical happy happy musical, after the characters get their wishes fulfilled the second part of the movie pull you out of that and take you into the real life perspective of dealing with the consequences of your actions. There is a real feel of danger, of sorrow, but ultimately learning from your mistakes and come together to defeat the threat and start a new life together.  Some people is complaining about the dark tone of the second half of the movie but people fail to realize that this a Disney adaption of the musical and they have tone it down.  In the original musical: The steward hit Jack's mother in the head with his rod (which could be too graphic for small kids), Rapunzel is trampled by the Giant's Wife to the horror of the Witch and the Prince, the royal family die of starvation as they got lost in the woods, both Princes replace the Cinderella and Rapunzel with Sleeping Beauty and Snow White, although is implied in the movie in the musical Granny and Red Ridinghood mother died, bottom line the dead toll is way higher and graphic.

6864026,5,B00Q7WBGHG,"I think the reason a lot of people don't like the movie is because they don't quite understand it.
a) No, it's not supposed to be a happy musical about fairy tales. It's a commentary on morality and what it means to be ""right"", ""good"", ""nice"", and ""bad"". It's about the legacy you will leave your children and it's told through fairy tales because they are stories that have been passed down for generations.
b) Sondheim writes his music for the actor. When he writes, his main goal is not to write a catchy tune that will win an Oscar. He writes his music to appropriately communicate the movie's themes to the audience and provide insight to the characters thought process. It's very Shakespearean, in a way.
All in all, it's an amazing musical movie. Stellar performances from the entire cast, especially Meryl Streep as The Witch and Lila Crawford as Little Red Riding Hood. Marshall's direction is executed very well. For the fans of the original stage show, it's an appropriate adaptation, maintaining the original story and score.
Quick note on the rating. Being Disney, the movie did tone down some of the grislier aspects of the stage version, so it is PG. It's PG the way ""Life of Pi"" is PG. Kids wouldn't fully understand the full themes, and some parts may be a bit intense, but it's still a wildly entertaining movie. Loved it.",1422230400,10,1340,4.658227848101266

This movie consisted of story lines that made no sense or did not tie in very well, the music was not memorable at all, the songs just sounded like regular script lines being sung to ""force-fit"" into music by mediorce singers, and the ending was not a happy ending or memorable. My daughter who remembers Johnny Depp as Captain Jack Sparrow, now sees him as a ""canine"" pedophile trying to suduce little Red. That whole scene had a lot of adult sexual undertones in it. Had I known, I'm not sure I would have taken my 8-year old daughter to this movie.

They all sing very well, and I especially enjoyed Emily Blunt, Chris Pine, and of course herself, Miss Streep. The movie is long. But audiences are so untuned today of movies in 2 parts, the distributors don't dare release it with an intermission. Because, some might leave at the end of the first part, thinking it was over. But like the movie of ""Les Miz"" it needs an intermission. Especially with this show, as with ""Sunday in the Park with George"", Act 2 shows the flip side of Act 1. When they are run together that distinction is not so emphasised. Take the kids, they will love it.

6864032,5,B00Q7WBGHG,"Brilliant movie. I am glad Disney is taking risks in the movies they are taking on. Life isn't a stereotypical fairytale. P.S. have you read the Grimm Fairytales? They aren't fluffy. Life isn't fluff. Life is full of ups and downs: it is about dealing with giants and change. This movies challenges us to look beyond just the thing we want. Everything in life has some sort of consequence. I am sure Disney doesn't support cheating on one's spouse. If you think that is what Disney is saying, then, I am sorry, but you do not know how to watch a movie. Every action/wish had a consequence. Cinderella's Prince ends up alone and the Baker's Wife dies. If you watch this movie with your kids, have a conversation about the movie with them. Ask them what they saw and what they learned from the movie. As a parent, this was a perfect movie to watch with my child, and then have a conversation about what we just watched: ""Children Will Listen."" Look at what happened between the Witch and Rapunzel. She sheltered Rapnzel from the world, so she became afraid of the world until she met her prince who loved her. The musical version is different, so I will not speak to that one because she dies in the musical, which shows the Witch that her ability to control backfired. Also, there are worse stories in the Bible and on the news, so if you are really concerned with sheltering your children from the world, then don't show them this film. This film challenges people to look through other's eyes and realize that life isn't a fairytale. Life is about the choices we make and the action we take. Consequences happen regardless of how much we try to control. It is about movie forward despite all that has happened. Disney is becoming more dimensional and worldly as a company. Life isn't the stereotypical Disney you have dreamt up. Accept it. Learn from it. And move forward. Not every family is perfect, nor should every Disney film only portray acceptable values. People learn from making the wrong choices. Life is full of wrong choices, and if you haven't made a wrong choice in your life then you are lying to yourself. Did you learn from the wrong choice? Did you grow as a person? Did you make the same mistake again? This is a deep film, and I am glad Disney decided to support this story.

I highly recommend purchasing this film.",1421884800,19,2337,4.551068883610451
6864033,1,B00Q7WBGHG,"The Disney version of what was an excellent musical pushes Satanism. ""Witches are sometimes right"" and ""What ever you decide is right for you is what it right."" Both lines are delivered one after the other toward the end of the film, as it culminates. Gee, this is the same thing that the serpent in the Garden of Eden tells Eve and Adam, ""You will be like gods, knowing good and evil."" It is not our prerogative to decide what is right or wrong but God's.

6864035,1,B00Q7WBGHG,"""Into the Woods"" is one of the worst A-list-star, major-studio movies I have ever seen. It lacks magic. It's boring and it is so inept it's actually offensive. Performances by international stars like Meryl Streep, Emily Blunt and Johnny Depp go kerplunk on the screen, without motivation or artistry. The cinematography is murky and flat, as if provided by Moe's Sporting Goods and Cinematography-To-Go.

The problem of ""Into the Woods"" can be summed up in one word: ""meta."" ""Into the Woods"" is an attempt to *tell* fairy tales while simultaneously making meta commentary *about* fairy tales. The film fails on both points.

Imagine someone telling you an anecdote about what happened with their day, and stopping after every line to say, ""At this point, you should be feeling empathy because I have just told you a sad thing. At this point, you should be feeling exhilaration, because I have just told you a celebratory thing. At this point, you should be concluding that Obama's economic policies have failed, because I have just told you that I do not have enough money for lunch. At this point, you should be feeling frustrated, because I have just defied your expectations of how this story should end.""

Think of how rapidly that storytelling style would grate on you.

""Into the Woods""'s plot is a regurgitated slop, with several fairy tales mined for their money shots and slapped together in order to make some arcane point about how fairy tales are really psychologically and socially complex documents, full of implications about sexuality, gender roles, parent-child relations, and economic inequity.

There's no narrative drive, no need to see what will happen next. The plot elements were just thrown in the air and allowed to fall to the ground in a random fashion. There is no main character to root for. There's no goal to be achieved and celebrate or mourn for. None of the actors can register a breath of conviction because there's nothing happening that anyone could care about. When the movie feels over, it suddenly lurches on for twenty more minutes.

The music and songs do not deserve to be called either ""music"" or ""songs."" Is Stephen Sondheim the first fully deaf man ever to make a career as a composer and lyricist? Does he compose his music and lyrics by throwing darts at a piano and a thesaurus? I saw Rodgers and Hammerstein's magical ""Cinderella"" when I was around five years old. I have not seen it since. I can still sing some of the songs, they touched me that deeply, especially ""In my own little corner,"" which captures the heart and soul of every little girl who ever felt alone and escaped on dreams to a better world.

I couldn't begin to recapitulate a single one of the songs from ""Into the Woods"" and I saw it just a few days ago, except for the line ""Children will listen."" All I remember is: ""Children will listen blah blah blah."" Actually, since it's Stephen Sondheim, it's more like ""Chil' dren will LISten blah blah BLIIIH."" With the ""BLIIIH"" on a minor key.

There's a scene where two dueling handsome princes sing a competitive song: I'm more handsome than you; I am suffering more than you are suffering romantically. It's a great concept accompanied by a lousy song and even worse execution. Chris Pine and Billy Magnussen, both talented stars, are directed to move without grace or charm, and they do all this in leather clothing in a waterfall. The entire time you are thinking, ""Wow, that water is really gonna ruin that leather.""

Fairy tales are magic. Fairy tales do make important points about gender roles, socioeconomic inequities, and parent-child-relations. Fairy tales are deep. If you want to immerse yourself in those points, read scholars like Bruno Bettleheim, Alan Dundes and Bengt Holbek. Ripping the innards out of a fairy tale and tossing those innards about randomly kills the tale. All you get is inert fairy tale innards. ""Into the Woods"" isn't sophisticated or intelligent, as it desperately wants to be. It isn't saying big, thoughtful things about fairy tales. It's just a big, meandering, amateurish misfire created by people who really aren't as sophisticated as they think they are.",1421798400,30,4166,4.872881355932203

6864039,2,B00Q7WBGHG,"Shame on you Disney!

First, let me address fans of the Musical ""Into the Woods.""  I have no doubt that the musical itself is very enjoyable.  The dark themes and existential question it confronts are great and things I typically relish.  The common retort, I hear, is, ""what did you expect?...it's a 'dark' musical ""not meant for kids!""

Agreed!  But mind you, not everybody has had the cultural privileges of being acquainted with every musical, and this is no small group.  To this majority demographic, one must rely on the traditional avenues for judgement on the content of a film: 1) Trailer  2) Rating 3) The studio making the film.

In this case, we have a trailer that does not expose the adult nature of the film; we have rating of PG, and under the banner of Disney.  Furthermore, every preview of the film was targeted at children.

Now as far as the film itself - I felt it was struggling to find itself and the compromises Disney took to try and 'soften' it ended up hurting the product.  I would have rather they went full on dark, positioning it correctly (ala Sweeny Todd) and do the original musical justice...instead you have a bastardization of a musical that tries to tow the line from being 'family' friendly, and the edgy truthful musical it originally was.  In the end, it ends up not being family friendly or remarkably dark.  Disney should have passed on this, have another studio let the director go at it full blast...instead of this compromised product.

*spoiler alert*

So what about the film was so egregious in its inappropriateness to children?  How about the themes of sexual lust?  (Prince Charming seduces one of the main protagonists' wife, and she willingly obliged) Pedophilia?  (Johnny Depps 'Fox' character has ""White Van no windows"" undertones) Meaningless death? (many are killed for no apparent reason other than to say the world is cruel.)  Mind you, I am no prude, I can critically sit through  Gaspar No Irreversible and not even flinch.  But I would like to keep my children's innocence for at least some of their childhood, thank you very much, Disney.  Some kids that are too young to pick up on these might enjoy it - but some older kids will no doubt find some portions of the film awkward to say the least.

***UPDATE***

I've been getting some negative feedback on this review, I found it quite ironic that a film about child abuse (and the super fans that this musical/film endear) are lashing out against a critique that is based on child protection... One of the insights of the musical/film is the negative impact early experiences with parents/environment will have on kids.  I assume fans find some sort of relatability/applicability to this main theme.  It's comical to see now as adults in real life, this wisdom went over their heads.  If you love the film - awesome - more power to you, but wouldn't you have rather an appropriate studio be truer to the musical and be as dark as it can be without the compromises to soften it and make it 'passable' as a Disney family film?",1421712000,29,3040,4.684905660377359

6864042,5,B00Q7WBGHG,"Into the Woods is simply the greatest musical ever written. However, it has always been taxed with a debilitating stage to tell a glorious story. This film is what Sondheim's lyrics (and I) have been, ever so patiently, waiting for.

Every single actor is at the top of their heap. Finally an actress is selected that can do the Witch adequate justice. Streep is simply dazzling and heartbreaking. Kendrick is delicately enchanting and oh so earnest as Cinderella, not to mention her voice fits the role better than any before her (though that can be said for the entire cast). Crawford and Huttlestone have some pipes that are commanding and showstopping. Depp, Pine, Corden, Baranski, and Billy Magnussen are all perfectly cast and shine like the sun. Blunt is the truly remarkable thespian here. Never did I ever dream that the snooty office girl in The Devil Wears Prada would rise to rival her juggernaut of a previous co-star, Streep. With a sweet cadence in her tone; reminiscent of the days of old.

People who hate this movie, don't understand what it, or the stage adaptation that came before it, are truly about. This story is one that has been told a billion times over, whether people hear it or not. It's a cautionary tale in every sense of the word. Showing you lifes hand, daring you to learn from its parables. Though, few do.

6864044,4,B00Q7WBGHG,"One of my first Amazon reviews was none other than the 2012 film Les Miserables. What I found most interesting was how much I was able to enjoy the movie as a whole despite my initial dislike for musicals. So naturally when I first heard about Into the Woods and saw the cast list, my curiosity came into play. So here is what I think about the movie Into the Woods.

As Into the Woods opens, we see a certain baker and his wife that run a bakery; which is where we see a familiar little girl in a red coat who fancies their bread/pastries. Later on, The Baker and his wife receive an offer from a Witch: if they can provide her with a cow white as milk, yellow hair, a red cape, and a gold slipper, the Baker's wife will be able to conceive a child.

Emily Blunt comes off her strong performance in last year's Edge of Tomorrow and delivers another great performance as the Baker's wife in Into the Woods. Though I do wish her character had developed better towards the end(I'll speak on that later) I do feel her performance works really well in the film. Lilla Crawford does an exceptionally entertaining job playing Little Red riding Hood. James Corden does a nice job here as The Baker and I enjoy the chemistry he shares alongside Emily Blunt. Anna Kendrick gives the movie a Highlight in her role as Cinderella. She embodies the role really well with her musical numbers and her acting ability. Chris Pine was also wonderful as the Prince and Johnny Depp is sure to make you laugh playing the Wolf. But the show stealer in Into the Woods is Meryl Streep as the Witch. Funny, but ever so sneaky, one minute she's there and the next minute she's gone. I also admire the overall look and stature Meryl Streep gives the character.

The story in Into the Woods gave me some interesting thought. For the most part, Into the Woods' story progresses exactly how it should, but there were a few instances that I feel some things COULD have happened differently. Some scenes did in fact have me questioning the PG rating this movie has, while other scenes just happened a little TOO quickly. That in itself had me pondering that the movie was a little shorter than it should have been. While I thoroughly enjoyed Emily Blunt's role as the Baker's Wife,(MILD SPOILER) there is a certain scene that happens and then another thing happens which made me feel like her character was not entirely done justice. At times, the set pieces do not always look as convincing as I feel they should. And while the 2nd part of Into the Woods has ups/downs, overall I do admire the themes, how the fairy tales are sort of blended in together at once, and the undeniable charm of the 3rd act. And even still, Into the Woods manages to be a good movie due primarily to the cast(mostly Meryl Streep), the music, and the themes of the storyline.

To close, while I won't say Into the Woods is the best musical adaptation, I did enjoy the movie for the most part. Into the Woods is not spectacular, but it is

6864045,2,B00Q7WBGHG,"Meryl Streep hamming it up was the only enjoyable aspect of this movie, which takes several of the famous fairy tales (Jack and the beanstalk, Little Red Riding Hood, Cinderella, Rapunzel) and connects them together in a neverending songfest devoid of any actually catchy tunes. The movie feels like it goes on and on and on; the songs definitely do. At one point, the movie becomes tolerable when it appears to have a happy ending, and then things fall apart and you realize that the damn movie is going to go on and on and on some more and what's worse what little sympathy you have for the characters totally vanishes as they become nasty. Don't bother seeing it, much less buying this. Unless you're a masochist.

None of my family enjoyed it at all, though my daughter had asked that we go see it. I felt so cheated I almost asked the theater for my money back.",1421280000,5,866,4.481012658227848
6864046,5,B00Q7WBGHG,"I confess that I binge listened to the soundtrack before seeing this film and was thoroughly impressed with the vocals. It got me excited going to the screening. I also admit that I am a fan of the Broadway musical. I've seen the play this film is based on starring Bernadette Peters, Vanessa Williams and Phylicia Rashad. All three have played the witch. I have watched Johanna Gleeson light up the stage with energy, charm and humor. I noticed every change, subtraction and addition in the cinematic adaptation and I must say, this film is a triumph. It has wit, humor, emotion, magic and music - all the makings of a great musical.

The first fifteen minutes, the prologue, is edited with such vivacity and rhythm that you are immediately engulfed into the stories and the action. Then, Director Rob Marshall slowly starts to focus on the rhythms and details of each individual story. From the Baker and his wife, to Little Red Riding Hood, to Jack, to the Witch and Cinderella. All their stories are told with the same passion and intent as the others, each with their individual flair. Yet somehow Marshall is able to have each story fit perfectly into the grand puzzle that is Into the Woods.

I could rave on and on about Sondheim's score. His scores always have a sort of, inside joke sound to them. It's as if Sondheim knows something we don't know when he composes. There is an obvious humor and wit in Sondheim's score of Into the Woods, but it is the lyrics that tell the story. James Lapine, who wrote the screenplay and the libretto for the Broadway musical, makes some interesting changes for the film version. Fans of the musical will recognize the changes immediately and they may or may not like them. I personally liked them. For those who've never seen or even heard the Broadway version, this film will entertain and even touch them.

Meryl Streep, is the best Witch I've seen. The finest actress of all-time gives The Witch a portrayal big enough to fit Rob Marshall's theatrical style, but is subtle enough for us to understand her. Her solo Stay With Me is one of the best scenes in the whole movie and one of the best acted scenes this year. But, it is the show-stopping number of Last Midnight that will leave a lasting impression on you. I haven't been able to stop listening to it since I saw it. I was in jaw-dropping awe in the theater watching that number. It's because Meryl Streep doesn't just sing a song (she has a beautiful voice and can surprisingly belt very well), she acts it. She feels each word and doesn't waste them. She's able to find the subtext in every song, every line of dialogue, every lyric. She will definitely be a presence this awards season and rightfully so.

Speaking of showstoppers, I must mention the funniest duet in any musical from any time, Agony. Sung by Chris Pine and Billy Magnussen, who play Cinderella and Rapunzel's princes respectively, the number is beautifully staged and timed hilariously. Everyone in my theater roared with laughter and I was apart of it. That may actually be the best musical number in the whole movie.
I'd also like to point out James Corden, who really surprised me. I knew he'd do the comedic portrayal of The Baker well, but it is the dramatic parts that had me apprehensive. He killed them. His chemistry with Emily Blunt is very believable. They work well together and they both have fantastic voices as well.

I think Blunt is one of the most underrated actresses today and I'm confident this film will put her on the map. She is a grand talent. The million dollar question fans of the musical may have, ""Does she live up to Johanna Gleeson?"" My answer is, I don't know. They approach The Baker's Wife differently. Their choices completely differ and therefore they cannot be compared.

The last standout I want to mention is young Lilla Crawford, who some may know as Annie in the 2012 Broadway revival. She has impeccable timing and a great voice. It is a great feature film debut for the young star.

The ensemble overall is fantastic and work extremely well together. Of course the costume and production design are top notch, but I don't think anyone expected anything less. Rob Marshall and company have made the best American movie musical in over ten years. Ironically enough, Rob Marshall's  Into the Woods is the best musical since Rob Marshall's Chicago.  I give it 4 1/2 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 10 to 18.",1421193600,8,4435,4.625158831003812
6864047,5,B00Q7WBGHG,"Into the Woods is the Disney-produced movie version of the beloved and multi-Tony Award winning Stephen Sondheim masterpiece.  Featuring an exceptionally fine cast, Into the Woods is easily one of the best movies of the year.  Mobile users please note: my review is longer than may be easy to read on a mobile device.

The story is nominally about classic Brothers Grimm fairy tale characters.  A childless Baker and his Wife are sent into the woods by a Witch to find the objects she needs to reverse an old curse that has robbed her of her youth and beauty.  In exchange, the Witch will lift her own curse that has prevented the Baker from ever having children.  Along the way, they must obtain the objects from those who possess them, including a cow from Jack, a slipper from Cinderella, Red Ridings hood, and Rapunzels hair.

To Disneys credit, the story and the film work well enough so that nervous parents of younger children (though not those under 2nd or 3rd grade, perhaps) can enjoy it as a pretty safe family film.  Be warned, though, that the storyline does involve some of the darker elements of the real Brothers Grimm stories.  Cinderellas Wicked Stepmother chops off the toe of one daughter and the heel of another to ensure the slipper fits them, and other characters die (all off-camera).

Yet the movie is also a clever imagining of what happens after the Fairy Tale wishes come true.  Jack gets the gold and kills the Giant, but his outraged wife seeks revenge on the thief and murderer who stole her property and left her bereft of the Giant husband she loved.  Red Riding Hood is saved from the Wolf, but learns that those naughty feelings the Wolf has invoked can be nice . . . or not.  And Cinderella learns that her Prince may be Charming, but hes also shallow and faithless.  As he says with perhaps a soupcon of remorse, I was raised to be Charming, not sincere.

The cast  all of whom do their own singing -- is, without exception, excellent.  As the Witch, Meryl Streep brings color and nuance to her songs; Anna Kendrick is wistful and funny as an ambivalent Cinderella; and, James Cordon captures the Bakers doubts about his ability to be a good father.  Johnny Depp makes the most of his brief turn as a very seductive and appropriately sleazy Wolf.  The two real surprises are Emily Blunt and Chris Pine as the Bakers Wife and Prince Charming.  The camera loves the always beautiful Blunt, but its her singing and acting that win us over.  Pine gleefully throws himself into his role as a Prince utterly baffled about why any woman, let alone Cinderella, would want to resist his charms.  Agony, his duet with Billy Magnussen (as Rapunzels prince) is a show-stopper.

Sondheims brilliant exploration of these darker adult themes is, of course, what Into the Woods is really all about.  Like any parent, the Witch has done everything she can to protect her beloved Rapunzel from the dangers of the world outside and pleads with her to stay a child while you can be a child . . . Jack gains riches but loses his mother in the process.  Cinderella learns that her Prince is self-absorbed and faithless, while the Bakers Wife has the child she wants but cant resist Prince Charmings temptations.

By turns funny, sad, and deeply moving, Into the Woods is a fable about the risks and rewards that wait for us all in the real world.",1421193600,7,3361,4.616161616161616
6864048,2,B00Q7WBGHG,"I really feel like the problems with Into the Woods fall into 2 categories: the problems with the ""fairy tale"" stuff at the start and the problems with the fairy tale deconstruction at the end.

First off, the baker and his wife conceit that they use to tie all the fairy tales together in the first section is pretty tenuous at best, and they bafflingly change large parts of the fairy tales in question for no apparent reason. On the good side, most of the songs are well done and over all the first bit is pretty strong, if sort of scattered and slow. If the movie had ended at the prince's wedding I would think the movie was unambitious and flawed but over all pretty enjoyable, especially for kids.

However all that goes out the window with the deconstructive 2nd half, the moral relativism involved in justifying infidelity and murder, the way every single main character has their whole family murdered, etc, the nonsensical killing off wholesale of large parts of the cast, etc etc, none of that made the least bit of sense and it wasn't pleasing to the audience or necessary for the story either. The songs get dumber and dumber and hav less and less to do with what's actually going on, characters show up in places where they really have no reason to be, doing things they have no reason to do (why did Jack have that scarf? did that make *any* sense to anyone?) and the characters just basically devolve into a bunch of people without motivation and without any redeeming qualities whatsoever.

Frankly is ludicrous to tell an orphaned child that the person who killed their parent isn't any better or worse than any of the rest of us and then follow that up with the ""triumphant"" ""if you tell kids something sometimes they actually do listen"" song over the credits. It is almost a deliberate waste of the audience's time and I don't get the logic behind it at all.

So to sum up, this is not a child's film, and its not adult enough to be an adult's version of a fairy tale either, and tbh i don't think it works in either medium anyway so I wouldn't recommend it to anyone other than maybe a film major who wants to see what happens when you try something and it doesn't work.",1421107200,6,2192,4.458852867830424

I literally clapped my hands together in delight at the conclusion of some of the musical numbers, they were SO cleverly intertwined and highly entertaining!  I especially loved the ""sing-off"" between Prince Charming and his brother, each baring his soul (as well as his chest!) as each attempted to depict himself as the more lovelorn of the two.  While the ending may have left some wondering what happened, the movie is true to the original play.

However, it cannot win the ""best adult movie of the year"" award because, for the first time, the adult movie goer will get to see what happens when the quality of the roles do not quite measure up to the quality of the actors performing them?

It simply means that the actors ""get a free ride:"" They get away with murder by being allowed to ""underperform"" their way to a big payday: The ""over-qualified actors"" are let off the hook and left to their own devices to find clever ways to ""dumb-down their acting"" in order to meet the diminished demands of their respective roles. Here they did so by either ""coasting"" or ""putting-on"" in rather hammish ways. Delp is already a past expert at it, but the others like Streep?

He and the girl who played Little Red Riding Hood were really good to be so young (just wish they were in a better movie). Other than that, I felt like it would never end. The last 30 minutes or so of the movie was so strange. I've had 24 hours since I saw the movie to think about it and like last night, I still think it sucked! If you really want to see this I'd recommend renting it at Red Box. If you really want to see a good musical, watch Moulin Rouge!",1420934400,6,832,3.9583333333333335

6864057,3,B00Q7WBGHG,"When I went to see Into the Woods, I didn't really know what to expect. I haven't seen the play and I've only seen about half of one trailer for the movie. All I knew about the movie was that it was a musical, it was Disney, it had Meryl Streep and Anna Kendrick (!!, in my book), and it was about fairy tales or something.

The plot kind of weaves together several well-known fairy tales (I believe they're all Grimm fairy tales, which I love and have read and re-read many times, but everyone knows the Disney adaptations of these fairy tales a bit more than the original Grimm versions). In the beginning of the movie, it made me feel like a kid, excitedly recognizing this character and fairy tale story and that one. A baker (James Corden) and his wife (Emily Blunt) can't have children due to a spell the witch next door (Meryl Streep) put on their house. In order for her to reverse the spell, the baker and his wife need to track down 4 items. The movie has a cute song detailing which items are needed, but put more simply, the baker needs to track down Cinderella's slipper, Red Riding Hood's cape, Jack (of Jack and the Giant fame)'s white cow, and Rapunzel's hair.  This movie meshed together these fairy tales with this new story of the baker and his wife, and it's a pretty cute, original take. Besides Streep, Corden, and Blunt, the cast had many familiar faces, like Anna Kendrick as Cinderella, Chris Pine as Prince Charming, Johnny Depp as The Wolf, Tracey Ullman as Jack's mother, Frances de la Tour as the Giant, Christine Baranski as Cinderella's Stepmother, and Lucy Punch as one of Cinderella's stepsisters. Also starring in this movie (although not known to me before this movie, but possibly known to others) are Daniel Huttlestone as Jack, Lilla Crawford as Little Red Riding Hood, Billy Magnussen as Rapunzel's prince, and Mackenzie Mauzy as Rapunzel.

Again, I haven't seen the musical, so I can't make comparisons here between the movie and the play. I can't tell you if the movie stays true to the musical or if it's better or worse or anything like that.  As far as the songs in the movie are concerned, there were some songs in this movie that I really liked, and others that were a bit boring and dragged on. In fact, the movie in general seemed to drag on. There was a fake-out ending where everything comes together nicely and you think the movie is coming to a close, before something happens and then the movie drags on for another 45 minutes or so. At 2 hours and 5 minutes, I felt while watching the movie that it was a bit too long.  It plodded and dragged on at times, and there were a few times that I was simply bored.

Also, for a Disney movie about fairy tales that's rated PG, I didn't think this was the best family movie pick. It was a bit dark at times, and again, the length and tedium at times probably wouldn't hold the interest of younger children. Some of the songs and familiar characters are sure to entice kids, but there will likely be a few times during the movie that they start squirming in their seats because of a boring song or slow spot. (I was even doing that at times, wondering how long the movie was going to be.)

Overall, I thought the plot of the movie was really interesting and unique, but the movie was also unnecessarily long. There were many clever and funny parts, but, as I've said a few times already, it did drag on at times. I was reminded a bit while watching this of Enchanted, mostly just because Enchanted was another Disney live action adaptation of fairy tales, and I couldn't help but think that Enchanted pulled it off better. That movie was a bit brighter, more fast-paced, had catchier songs, and I didn't want it to end. Into the Woods was good, but not great. I really enjoyed nearly every actor/actress's performance in this movie, and was really impressed by the singing. A fun movie, but may be better as a rental.",1420848000,6,3911,4.469187675070028

Several of your favorite fairytale characters find their happy ever after, before everything gets sent to hell in a handbasket once they realize that fairytale endings aren't all they're cracked up to be.

What did I think?

At times laugh-out-loud funny at others wheres-my-tissue sad, this is a grown-up's fairytale with a strong message about being careful what you wish for and whether happily ever after is possible with someone you have known for 2.5 seconds.

Fans of the stage show may shed a tear that the adaptation has dropped the second double act between the Charming prince brothers (Agony, the over-the-top duet which included just about every cinematic clich was the funniest point in the film) but overall it was a very satisfying translation from stage to screen. It would be nice to think Into the Woods the film will springboard composer Stephen Sondheim into the musical theatre limelight alongside the likes of Andrew Lloyd Webber. It probably wont. In fact the 15 minute opening overture will probably be enough to ensure some never again give a musical a try. But anyone who can see past that will see an intelligent tale thats been well told and extremely well acted.

Even better, it takes four of the classic Grimm tales, winds them together neatly, and even goes a bit beyond where they traditionally end. The storytelling side of the script worked well, effects were effective (but not overblown), and Streep worked well as the witch.

What's not: Well, the musical side of it wasn't actually bad, but I found it quite forgettable. Distracting, mostly, as trying to wind the songs into the regular conversation didn't do much for me.

6864064,4,B00Q7WBGHG,"Theatrical film review.  Just like the Tony award winning Broadway production, the movie version is messy, with plotlines, unlikely coincidences and other head scratchers.  But I didn't go to this movie for a reality check.  I came for Stephen Sondheim's music and lyrics.  Director Rob Marshall is no stranger to musicals and here he sticks with the basics that appeared on Broadway.  Sure the sets are more elaborate as are the special effects.  But this movie won't be confused with a big blockbuster in spite of its $50 million budget.  I suspect much of that went to the cast.  And it's a good one.

In this mishmash of fairy tales, James Corden and Emily Blunt star as The Baker and The Baker's wife.  Unable to have children thanks to a spell placed on them by their neighbor, The Witch (a splendid Meryl Streep).  The Witch is under a spell of her own which took away here beauty.  Cinderella is played by Anna Kendrick.  She's wanting to go to the ball which here lasts for 3 nights.  With the help of her singing birds she does and meets the handsome prince (Chris Pine).  Other characters include Jack (as in ""the beanstalk"") played by Daniel Huttlestone, Little Red Riding Hood (Lilla Crawford), The Wolf (Johnny Depp), Repunzel (Mackenzie Mauzy), her prince (Billy Magnussen), Jack's mum (Tracey Ullman) and Cindy's mean stepmother (Christine Baranski).

Essentially the story centers around The Witch agreeing to lift the no-baby spell if the couple will collect 4 essential items that she needs to lift her own spell.  They are a white cow, red cloak, corn-yellow hair and gold slippers.  So now you get it, right?  What has always given me cause for a chuckle in this story, are some of the below the radar adult themes.  Starting with The Wolf's eyeballing Red and perhaps not just because she would be good to eat.  And then there is the probable adultery between The Baker's Wife and Cindy's prince.  It's nothing overt so kiddies and some adults won't even notice.

As far as the music, everyone does a terrific job with their songs, and there are many to spread around.  I'm never surprised anymore by how well actors can hold a tune.  While I'm sure there are technical enhancements needed now and again, the actor/singer's do the music proud.  And that's what I came for.",1420502400,29,2294,4.72979797979798

6864066,2,B00Q7WBGHG,"I just went to see Into the Woods. The musical was recommended to me a few years ago by a teacher of mine, so I went into the theater knowing that Into the Woods pokes fun at fairy tales and deconstructs the idea of happily-ever-after. Since I've never listened to the music, I went in with very few preconceived notions about what the movie would be like, but I figured I would enjoy it because I love musicals and satire.

The first forty-five minutes of the movie were decent and, even though I wasn't a huge fan of the music, I was open to seeing where the story would go. Some of the things I enjoyed: I thought the visuals/cinematography/costumes were lovely to look at, I enjoyed some of the concepts that were explored, I liked maybe one or two songs, Meryl Streep as the Wicked Witch, and the side-story of the Wicked Witch, Rapunzel, and the Prince.

Personally, I didn't think the PG rating fit the bill. I was very uncomfortable with the sexual undertones of the relationship between the Big Bad Wolf and Little Red Riding Hood. The Wolf is portrayed more as a pedophile, and his behavior and lyrics are very lascivious. Later, after the Wolf has been killed, Little Red Riding Hood sings about the Wolf being ""scary, yet exciting"" and teaching her things she never knew before, suggesting a lot more than what is simply on the surface (mind you, this particular part of the story involves an old man and a very young girl). There were many instances of violence (and even an adulterous scene) that I believe is way too mature for kids and pre-teens (and I'm not a parent).

I won't give anything away, but there came a point in the story where things began to spiral downward. The music and singing became unbearable, the plot became muddled and meandering, and the events and characters became mismatched and inconsistent with what had been earlier presented. Overall, I thought the music was awful, annoying, repetitive, and shrill. There was really nothing remarkable about the music - it was the same tune played over and over again. I like musicals, but I like when the songs serve to move the story forward, while simultaneously shedding light on the characters and events that have already transpired. The music in Into the Woods prevents the plot from moving forward; it goes on and on, drilling in what is already apparent to the audience.

Since I've never seen the play, I'm not really sure how the movie compares. I'm not even sure who to recommend the movie to, or if I should recommend it at all. If you enjoyed the movie, that's great - I respect your opinion. I, for one, have never felt so tortured by a movie and it was the only movie experience in my life where people were consistently streaming out of the theater. By the time the movie ended, half of the audience had already left.",1420329600,15,2816,4.5813492063492065

I wouldn't even really call it a musical.  It was more of an operetta, with notes thrown at a script, rather than lyrics written for songs. I was astonished to see Steven Sondheim's name in the credits, it was so bad.  It is not for children at all.  A lot of references to sexual predators, and misbehaving children even after consequences are shown.  Meryl Streep's performance was worthy, but the vehicle was a waste of her time and talent.

I was seriously thinking, ""Please disney, next time you want to try 'Wicked' hire the once upon a time writers to come up with the story. They know how to keep the witch...... THE WITCH.....and still make her sympathetic.""

this film is proof that they should have skipped Maleficent and gone straight to Mother Gothel (she has no name in the film, but I'm calling her that because of tangled lol!).

I have seen EVERY a fractured fairytale (Maleficent, wicked, and Once Upon a Time) and this is the fairy godmother of them all. The first, and one of the two best, the other being once upon a time.
IT is a far better film than Maleficent because it teaches both men and women to be careful what they wish for without going heavy handed on feminism and still respecting true love.
The witch is better too. The Witch is sympathetic while still being the...............witch.
She also teaches the 'good' characters that their own flaws are to blame for their problems, not her.

I may be one of the few who prefer the disney version to the Broadway version

A few things you should know:
1. Do your research before taking your kids. I grew up in the era of films like willow, Star Wars, Neverending story, are you afraid of the dark, etc, and I KNOW that not all pg movies are for small children. parents did their homework back then. I'm shocked that people actually think that Maleficent and Frozen,where the men scheme to try to MUTULATE the woman in some way is more appropriate for kIds! How is teaching your child that there are consequences for cheating, like loosing the love and trust of your spouse, less appropriate?

6864069,4,B00Q7WBGHG,"The story consists of four fairy tales that run concurrently and are connected by the cursed village baker (James Corden) and his wife (Emily Blunt). James Corden as the baker, reminded me of Martin Freeman playing an ineffective questioning Bilbo.

Three tales start the film, a fourth one, Rapunzel (Mackenzie Mauzy) comes in later. The film has humor within the songs such as when Jack's mom (Tracey Ullman) questions what Jack (Daniel Huttlestone) is doing with the cow as you can only get milk from female cows. Red Riding Hood (Lilla Crawford) meets the Big Bad Wolf (Johnny Depp) along the way and invokes a song that borders on pedophilia. Anne Kendrick gave us an excellent performance as Cinderella who feels meh about the prince. The baker must collect an item from each of them in order to break a spell of barrenness placed on him by the witch (Meryl Streep).

The film follows the original fairy tales better than say the film ""Exodus..."" or ""Noah"" followed the Bible. There were campy moments by design such was when both princes broke into song about their love agony, getting the biggest laugh from the audience. The film also had some serious life theme: death, children leaving the nest, and diversity...giants are people too. The big problem I had with the film that would look better on a stage, was at 1:15 into the film it became a different story, one that didn't rely on fairy tales, and it went downhill and got stupid.

Yes, the fairy tale musical that begs the question, ""Would you rather? Anne Kendrick or Emily Blunt?""

6864070,5,B00Q7WBGHG,"Stephen Sondheim is arguably Americas finest living composer of musical theatre.  His musicals have rarely been adapted into equally special musical movies. Tim Burtons 2007 Sweeney Todd adaptation was great as a standalone film, but disappointed fans by cutting a lot of the score. Into the Woods blends many Grimm fairytales and becomes something of an anti-fairytale in the process. The characters face real problems and consequences for their actions. Its a story that grows darker and darker, and leaves its audience not totally miserable, but certainly not happy. How does this complicated musical work as a Disney movie?

The answer is surprisingly well.

A baker (James Corden) and his wife (Emily Blunt) live next to a vengeful witch (Meryl Streep) who years ago cursed their house and his family, preventing the couple from having children. In order to reverse her curse, the couple must bring her the cape as red as blood, the cow as white as milk, the hair as yellow as corn and the slipper as pure as gold. Meanwhile, Cinderella (Anna Kendrick,) Little Red (Lilla Crawford,) Jack (and the beanstalk) and his mother (Daniel Huttlestone and Tracey Ullman) Rapunzel (Mackenzie Mauzy), a hungry wolf (Johnny Depp), and handsome but dim-witted princes (Chris Pine and Billy Magnussen) have their own subplots going on, and they begin to tie together rather quickly.

Later, after the happily ever after, the characters must come to terms with their own selfishness and the consequences of their actions when a giant threatens their entire village.

The dark story is altered in the smallest ways, but isn't butchered like I thought it would be. The mix of Hollywood and Broadway actors feels great, and everybody seems to have great chemistry. Its one of the best-sung movie musicals in recent memory. Rob Marshall, director of the classic Chicago adaptation and the misfire Nine adaptation is back in his element here. He makes the transition from stage to screen feel almost effortless. Nothing feels stagy, Sondheims tongue-twister lyrics sound crystal clear and the visual effects, impossible onstage, are top notch.

Lets talk about the cast. Meryl Streep proved she could carry a tune in 2008s Mamma Mia adaptation. But Sondheim is obviously more of a challenge than ABBA. She absolutely nails her songs, which are some of the best of the whole show. She shows off an unbelievably extensive vocal range, and I hope she does a hundred more movie musicals. Her Witch is also probably the best character of the whole story. Shes hilarious and devious. Even her entrances and exits are priceless.

We could have assumed Streep would be great here, so lets get to the real standouts of the cast  Emily Blunt and Chris Pine. Who knew either of these people could sing? They both sound exquisite and give fantastic, funny and layered performances. Anna Kendrick also really ought to have a record deal by now. She hits the many high notes of the Cinderella character with ease. The Broadway people  Corden, Crawford and Huttlestone  are predictably great as well. Truly, there isn't a bad performance among the bunch. Johnny Depp fans may be disappointed though  he has a glorified cameo, basically. He does a nice job with his one song, but don't expect him to have more than one scene.

Certain bits of the dark tale are cut from the film, but not enough to inspire grunts and groans among fans of the stage show. I feel like Marshall and crew were walking a tightrope and managed to stuff the dark soul of the stage show into the film, despite this being a Disney film. And, also, fair warning to parents of young children  don't take any children under the age of 12 or so to this movie. A lot of it can be very disturbing for young children. However, a lot of the old Grimm fables were quite disturbing, and were watered down for children over the years. Into the Woods is much more of a treat for adults, who can appreciate what a clever satire this is. It sneakily works in themes of abandonment, infidelity, grief, love/sex, rejection and betrayal. But, it never forgets the important overall message, be careful what you wish for.

Spiraling downward into a miasma of undignified slapstick, gargly songversations,  and dithering fairytale childhood scar analysis. And what is the deal with Anna Kendrick? Useless.  Mind you, the two prince's ""Agony"" duet was worthy. // Edited p.s. = This (any) movie should stand on its own.

6864072,3,B00Q7WBGHG,"Once upon a time, Stephen Sondheim and James Lapine created a hit musical classic called Into the Woods. Based on oft-told fairy tales, the show brought to life a childrens sometimes fearsome fantasy world and mixed it up with adult issues, rife with adultery and sexual undertones. It was a little rough around the edges, overlong and, at times, confusing, but Into the Woods, as a stage show, has a timeless appeal for all ages.

As much as I admire film director Rob Marshallhe did brilliant work with the musical version of ChicagoIm not sure hes the right choice for this material; someone with a quirkier, darker vision might have been more appropriate for this storyline. However, since Marshall is the go-to director for big Hollywood musicals these days (the unfortunate Nine notwithstanding) we get what weve got. To be perfectly succinct, this film production of Into the Woods has been completely DISNEYFIED and scrubbed squeaky clean by the studio sanitation department. And yet I doubt that it will maintain the interest of its intended audience.

For those unfamiliar with the story, its set in a fairyland of giants and witches and magic, and involves a small group of characters brought together by triumph and tragedy. A witch places a curse upon a baker and his family, setting the plot in motion. Residents in and around a small, unnamed village are variously effected as their standard, happily-ever-after fairytale endings are upended in a second act filled with death and destruction.  I won't say more about the plot to avoid spoilers. Suffice it to say, some characters get their comeuppance, some dont, some learn valuable lifes lessons and some simply disappear from the film without any explanation!

Top-billed Meryl Streep, as the Wicked Witch, brings a huge amount of energy and glee to her role, obviously having a fine time playing a gnarly-nailed, fright-wigged harpy. One of my favorite film actresses, Streep, nevertheless, brings such a huge amount of enthusiasm to the role that she, perhaps unavoidably, descends into camp; in the Disney canon, villainesses tend to be way over-the-top, anyway. However, Streep never embarrasses herself and is an admirable trooper singing her way through Witches Lament, Last Midnight and the heartbreaking Stay With Me.

Also blessed with surprisingly good pipes, Anna Kendrick shines when shes singing, but otherwise is a bit drab as Cinderella. Ive enjoyed her very much in other movies but in Into the Woods she almost fades into the CGI scenery. Chris Pines (Captain Kirk in the Star Trek movies) fares much better as Cinderellas handsome, charming, womanizing prince. Hes actually very funny, and his energetic musical number (Agony) with Rapunzels prince is a rousing showstopper. Former Bold and the Beautiful actress, MacKenzie Mauzy makes a fetching Rapunzel, but gets shortchanged on screen time with a story thats only half-finished. As her prince, Billy Magnussen does a fine job with the brief screen time hes allotted but, again, his storyline, being tied to Rapunzel, doesnt end so much as it just disappears.  In the role of Cinderellas stepmother, Christine Baranski would seem to be perfect casting but somehow isnt. The wicked stepsisters (Tammy Blanchard and Lucy Punch) also seem strangely lackluster.

13-year old Lilla Crawford makes bossy, empowered Little Red Riding Hood into a touch little cookieshe reminds me a little of Lucy in the Charlie Brown cartoonsand belts out a tune like a junior Ethel Merman. She is blessed with so much charisma and personality that she practically steals the show from the sinister wolf, underplayed with a sensual, witty &eacute;lan by Johnny Depp. In fact, Depps role is so brief as to actually be a cameo, but its a delightful turn and one that I seriously appreciated given his recent abysmal movie outings.

Jack (as in and the Beanstalk) is wonderfully played with Artful-Dodger-like charm by Daniel Huttlestone, while Tracy Ullman is at her hand-wringing histrionic best as his luckless mother.

My favorites, I think, are James Corden and Emily Blunt as the Baker and his wife. Both are simply sublime in their roles as recipients of the Witches curse. Running about higgledy-piggledy, the duo races through the film trying to undo the witches curse before midnight, otherwise theyll be permanently barren. Both Cordon and Blunt bring an honest degree of pathos to their roles, and there is a realism to their dilemma that elevates their characters above the rest.

The CGI-effects are quite good (and should be, considering that this is Disney) and I was more than a little impressed by the special effects wizardry that only faltered with the appearance of the Giants Wife on screen. The effects here differed from those in the rest of the movie, and were more on a par with that great, Grade-Z classic, Attack of the 50-Ft. Woman. WTF, Disney?

True to its roots, Into the Woods is still overlong and meandering, creating an inertia that seeps into the proceedings, dragging things down; there was a certain degree of interaction with the actors in the stage version that helped to combat this, and maintained the interest of both the kids and adults in the audience. Aside from some fine acting and a few interesting musical numbers, adults may find the film version of Into the Woods a chore to sit through.",1420243200,4,5353,5.044117647058823

6864074,5,B00Q7WBGHG,"Despite some patchy translation of the original production's poignancy and punch, Into the Woods is quite possibly the best film adaptation of the Sondheim/Lapine classic we could hope for. In reality, my rating would have been a 4.5 due to a range of nitpicks as well as that so-so third act--but I couldn't bear giving it any less than that. The cast is magnificent, the pacing is both brisk and relaxing, and the songs (and singing!) are as phenomenal as is expected.

For Parents: Keep in mind the primary targets for this story's moral is ADULTS, specifically PARENTS (""Be careful what kind of fairy-tale inspired life values you pass on to your children"".) That isn't to say children can't find things to enjoy or take away from it...but do realize that the story does get dark, and many of the stories call back to the original, darker versions of the familiar tales (the stepsisters cutting off parts of their feet, for example). If your child sat through Maleficent or the later Harry Potter films, they should be fine going into this. Definitely NOT for infants (someone actually brought one to my theater on CHRISTMAS NIGHT. WHAT?)

All in all, a lavish production rivaling Les Miserables in sophistication, one that I shall most certainly pride in my ownership.",1420156800,9,1273,4.861751152073733
6864075,5,B00Q7WBGHG,"In 1987, composer Stephen Sondheim and writer James Lapine collaborated to fashion a rather warped but darkly entertaining musical called INTO THE WOODS.  It's a sort of ""crossover"" fairy tale which answers the unusual question of ""what if Cinderella, Jack from the Beanstalk, Little Red Riding Hood, and Rapunzel all crossed paths?""  But the show goes beyond that, as evidenced in the synopsis.

Linking this eccentric collage together is an original story thread about a baker and his wife who are cursed by a vengeful witch to never have any children.  The reason--the baker's father stole goods from her garden, including some specific... magic beans.  The witch is willing to reverse their predicament if the couple can retrieve the necessary ingredients to provide a potion.  These include a cow, a red cape, a slipper, and yellow hair.  All this leads to a clever and often amusing mixup as fairy tale character after fairy tale character encounter one another, each with desires of their own.  Mistreated scullery maid Cinderella wants to visit the king's festival, while plucky Jack longs for his beloved cow Milky White to provide milk.  Then there's Little Red Riding Hood, a gluttonous and surprisingly sadistic youngster who gets led astray by a wolf (whose ""interest"" toward her suggests more than just food).  Finally, we have Rapunzel isolated in a tower, a couple of charming princes, and yes, beanstalks, giants, etc. etc.

After this first act, which deceptively seems to end the show on a ""happily ever after"" note, along comes Act II which twists the conventions of fairy tales upside down.  Things begin to fall apart.  Couples separate.  Characters betray one another.  Some even die.  OK, MANY die.  Worst of all, a wrathful ""giant"" of a woman holds the entire kingdom hostage demanding for ""the lad who climbed the beanstalk"".  The resolution of the show proves to be anything but happily ever after, but our characters emerge as wiser people, for better or worse.  Critics and audiences were shocked by the tragic, dark turn of the show's second act, but nonetheless, the show was a smash, earning Sondheim and Lapine Tony Awards for their work.  Today the show is hailed as a classic, and rightfully so.  Bittersweet though its final resolution may be, it nonetheless proves to be a work rich with cautionary messages, flawed characters, and a surprisingly deep amount of intelligence.

It's almost surprising, then, that it's taken quite a long time for this musical to be brought to the silver screen.  But in truth, INTO THE WOODS' journey to Hollywood was in development hell for more than fifteen years, dating back to the early 1990's.  Attempts which involved actors such as Danny DeVito, Cher, Steve Martin, and the late Robin Williams all turned out to be false starts.  It wasn't until 2002 when director Rob Marshall's adaptation of the musical CHICAGO proved to be a bonafide hit that talks for the film finally bore fruit.  That version wouldn't be seen for another twelve years, but arrive it finally has.

It is extremely ironic that this movie is a Disney production of all things, especially since the overall tenor of the musical clashes with the Mouse House's usual reputation of toning down much of the darker, violent aspects of the Grimm Fairy Tales.  Such moments still survive in the transition.  Aside from the aforementioned wolf subplot, we also have (mostly offscreen) bits of ""grim"" stuff such as toes and heels getting severed, blindings by thorn patches and wrathful birds, a wolf skinned into a cape (literally!), (implied) adultery between two married spouses, and yes, killings.

As it turned out, though, the marriage of Disney and Sondheim couldn't have been more ideal.  (Amusingly, the lively title tune for ""Into the Woods"" recalls a classic era of Disney long since forgotten.)  Considering that the Mouse House has recently been turning its own fairy tale conventions on its head with their recent and massively successful FROZEN, INTO THE WOODS turns out to be a perfect fit just like Cinderella's glass slipper to its rightful owner.  Marshall has done an outstanding job of translating the musical to the screen; from the first frame of the film, where we hear a disembodied narration intone the words ""once upon a time"" followed by the two-note clang of Sondheim's overture and a cross-cutting opening between the primary characters, the show exuberantly comes to life.  As a choreographer and longtime fan of the show in question, Marshall clearly understands the tone of the story and laudably remains faithful to the mood of the musical.  Nothing about his adaptation is ""Disneyfied"" in any way.  As mentioned, the film maintains the sometimes sadistic, darkly humorous edge of Lapine's libretto (the script for the film, incidentally, is penned by none other than James Lapine himself), and the ending is anything but happily ever after.

Even having said all this, there are some elements of the show which unfortunately didn't make it into the translation.  In the musical there is a narrator who serves as a character to the story; later on in the second act he is bumped off (No, seriously!), which causes the characters and the story to go completely off-rails!  As mentioned, there is also a high body count, with one of the victims being Rapunzel.  In this version, Rapunzel survives instead and rides off with her prince, but even then it is still presented in the film rather ambiguously; as Rapunzel and the prince gallop off into the mist, one is left with a slight feeling of uneasiness if ""happily ever after"" is really in store for this abused girl, especially since we later find out what a cad his brother (who courts Cinderella) turns out to be.  While I may have gone back and forth with the idea of Rapunzel living or dying, I have to say that either approach is ideal.  The idea is still the same.  The witch loses her only solace, her ""daughter.""

As for the narrator, he turns out to be none other than the Baker in voiceover; considering that (spoiler alert!) the show ends with the Baker telling his newborn child the same story we have just been presented with, this works quite well for the medium.  Killing off the narrator in the show worked because it was staged as a ""theatrical"" experience, whereas in film it would have been more difficult to pull off.  (And seriously, how can one kill off a disembodied voiceover?)

Loyalists to the show will probably still find some things to carp about aside from those; two songs are cut (but as a compromise, we hear the melodies as background music instead).  These include the jubilant ""Ever After"", which concludes Act I and the somber, reflective ""No More"" from Act II.  Frankly, though, even with such ""changes"", there is very little else that INTO THE WOODS loses in its new dress.  The impact of the show's intentionally dark second half is still reflected, if somewhat hastened.

All of this is important for fans of the show to keep in mind, but for anyone not familiar with INTO THE WOODS, it's in one's best interest to keep all of the above in mind before deciding to venture into this tale.  By that I don't necessarily mean the grittiness of the story; Sondheim's musical style is very unorthodox and atypical of what one would expect from musicals, namely Disney musicals.  His songs can be very jerky and ""wordy"" in nature, uncompromisingly difficult to sing.  One such example occurs in the latter half of the story, in the form of the fast-paced, stacatto-tempoed ""Your Fault,"" in which the characters point fingers at each other for their predicament.  But Sondheim is gifted at writing heartfelt, emotionally tender songs as well; the Witch's implore for Rapunzel to ""Stay With Me"" and the tear-jerkingly beautiful ""No One Is Alone"" both ringing out as sensitive and honest.  Even the closing song, ""Children Will Listen"" has a certain musical purity one wouldn't normally expect from the traditional.  Because of his unpredictable style, Sondheim can be an audience-divider, but the man has won over legions of accolades and fans, and for good reason.  Even if his output can be atypical, that is no negative; Sondheim's genius as a lyricist and a composer shines through really well in this work.

I've spent most of this review talking about the conventions of the show and the style of Sondheim's music as opposed to the movie itself.  As mentioned, Marshall proves to be the perfect choice to bring this musical to the screen and much of the success in his work is in no small account to the cast he has assembled, all of which provide fantastic performances, both on an acting and vocal level.  (The latter is especially crucial, because as mentioned, Sondheim's songs can be very difficult to sing.)  Even as a huge fan of the original Broadway cast recording featuring Bernadette Peters, I was still quite impressed with this ensemble; there are literally no false notes to be had.  Meryl Streep takes on Peters' iconic role as the work's most complex character, the witch, in a performance that could easily garner her another Oscar.  She is simply marvelous in the part; her bombastic turn in the witch's climactic number ""Last Midnight"" in particular a wickedly glorious highlight.  Anna Kendrick has the perfect fairy tale heroine voice for Cinderella, and she provides this ambivalent and emotionally strong character with just the right amount of emotion and heart.  As the Baker and his wife, both James Corden and Emily Blunt are absolutely terrific; the chemistry between them is believable and touching, and both sing quite well.  Both Daniel Huttlestone and Lilla Crawford are outstanding as Jack and Little Red Riding Hood; it is just refreshing to see both parts portrayed by actual children for a change.  No offense to Ben Wright or Danielle Farland from the original; they both performed well, but Daniel and Lilla could give both a run for their money.  Daniel's exuberant ""Giants in the Sky"" is delivered with all the brio and bravura of a fearless youth, while the latter is charming and delightfully sassy from the start.  Johnny Depp, in his second Sondheim big screen musical (the first being a surprisingly impressive if vocally raw Sweeney Todd in Tim Burton's sometimes restrained but effective treatment of the movie of the same title), gets to have a glorious time as the Wolf, growling and snarling like Sweeney with a flamboyant charm not unlike Jack Sparrow.  Although his costume design may not be what one would expect (a guy in a zoot suit with claws and lupine ears), his delivery of ""Hello Little Girl"" shows he's stepped it up since his Demon Barber days.  Chris Pine and Billy Magnussen contribute to the film's funniest scene, ""Agony"", in which both lament their seemingly impossible quests for finding their wives, and suit their princely roles quite charmingly.  (Although at times I found Pine more creepy in places, but maybe that's just me.)  Seriously, I could not find fault with anyone in this cast.  As far as movie musicals go, this is one of the best ensembles I've seen in years.

Visually, too, INTO THE WOODS looks quite pleasing; rather than adopting a lavish, big, over-the-top style, Marshall and cinematographer Dion Beebe use computer enhanced effects rather sparsely, opting instead for a richly dark and gritty color palette.  Considering the nature of the musical, this is appropriate and a refreshing break from many CG tests that we see these days.  Nothing about the sets or effects looks fake; even some of the more potentially implausible moments, like birds ""communicating"" with Cinderella, are handled with a simplicity that works well, and the witch's transformation scenes are effectively done without being overly ""showy.""  Only a brief, trippy interlude where we see Little Red Riding Hood toppling through an abyss of billowing blankets as she recounts being swallowed by the wolf in her amusing ""I Know Things Now"" may strike some as a bit artificial, but even then it is done quite artfully and in a way that does not come across as distracting.

Rich with moral ambiguity and with a twisted, macabre edge, INTO THE WOODS is treated with the respect it deserves for its big screen treatment.  With a terrific ensemble cast, fitting cinematography and skillful direction on the part of Marshall, any omissions or changes are more than compensated for by the efforts of everyone involved.  This is one of the finest movie musicals in years, and certainly deserves to be seen on the big screen.  And as someone who considers INTO THE WOODS one of my all-time favorite shows and loved the original to death, that's saying something.  Admittingly, your mileage may vary when it comes to enjoying this movie, but for anyone dreading any sort of ""Disneyfication""s of whatever kind can gladly put such fears to rest.  Major kudos to everyone involved for doing justice to this much loved musical.",1420070400,9,12938,4.926233287229138

6864077,2,B00Q7WBGHG,"The movie is good, but the stage play was great. Its a good movie for children, but the story lacks the oomph it needed to be great.
I grew up watching the Broadway recording. In middle school, I was in Into the Woods Jr., which is act one alone, ending with happily ever after. The original play shows that happy endings aren't real, dealing with tragedy is a part of life and learning to accept it is a part of growing up. It is realistic, honest, and insightful. This movie adaptation continues after ever after, but is not as honest, and in order to stay PG, is ignorant to the theme of the musical and eliminates characters and tragedies, mitigating the emotions of the piece. But emotion is what enhances art, and nice is different than good. The prettier the flower, the farther from the path... Its basically Into the Woods Jr+.

The play taught me so much about relationships, loss, and life. As a kid, I wished that more people would become familiarized with the musical. Well wishes come true, not free...

Thoughts going in: ""People should watch the Broadway show first.""
Thoughts going out: ""People should watch the movie first so when they watch the true masterpiece they're well-versed in the story and can enjoy the material that was left out, the way it should've been and appreciate it... rather than be disappointed.""

Act One was good. But make the wolf look like a wolf! The stage production had such a convincing wolf! ""But, no, it's Johnny Depp! We have to see his money-making face!"" Whatever...
Agony was beautiful and hilarious! The new take on Steps was perfect.
I was pleasantly surprised by the cast. It was the screenplay I was disappointed in. I loved Meryl Streep's performance! (And considering how much I love Bernadette Peters, I did NOT expect that.) Stay with Me was phenomenal and conveyed the depth that Lament lacked...

Act Two was... boring.
Agony was such a fan-favorite, so of course they cut the even funnier reprise. (This was fine because it doesn't add to the plot, but it'll sting when people who saw the movie sing Agony 1, unaware of the superior reprise.)

It wasn't clear that Jack's mom died until later, and that scene also dropped 2 other deaths, so it lost its impact. The scene is supposed to set the tone for the rest of the musical but instead it was incredibly sloppy. There was 1 ""she fell"" instead of the ""we just saw 3 people die in the play. The stakes were much lower, and made the movie insipid from then on.
Lament was pointless... Rapunzel ran away? Who cares? The play adds more depth to the Witch's character with the path it takes, and makes her more likable. Moments & Any Moment were good, but no insinuation of anything more than kissing, so who even cares? And the final verse of ""Moments"" is HILARIOUS but they cut it to make the adultery less unsavory. (Okay...) Your Fault was kind of weird because Jack and Red were really young, so the Baker was arguing with little kids. (But that's fine, it didn't hurt the film, it was just weird.) Last Midnight would've been more powerful if the movie had been more emotional and had built up to it. The song didn't fit in with the lackluster second act. ""No more"" thinking that The Mysterious Man is not integral to the story. No More is more essential to the plot than ""No One Is Alone."" Sorry, not sorry! And the narrator being an actual character adds SO MUCH to the musical. I don't want to give too much away (because the stage production has a hilarious surprise that one should enjoy spoiler-free), but the narrator emphasizes the characters' loss of direction and uncertainty of the future.

The play is much more profound, meaningful, and tragic. Near may be better than far, but it still isn't there. Act II of this film was weak. (And on a lighter note, the Broadway play has MANY more funny moments as well.) I just hope this movie makes people watch the Broadway recording also available on DVD and digital.

6864078,4,B00Q7WBGHG,"This review is for the movie as released in theaters, not the DVD (which hasn't come out yet).

First of all, I'm approaching this from the standpoint of a fan of the stage musical. It was the first professional stage production I'd ever seen. I own the DVD of the Broadway production, with Bernadette Peters. I have all of the music, and most of the play, memorized.

Brief spoiler-free review: It's not as fun as the stage musical, and I think the moral may have gotten a bit lost through the media translation. But I think they did as good a job as they could have. NOT FOR CHILDREN. I repeat: this story is NOT FOR CHILDREN. It never was meant to be.

Some vague spoilers to follow.

Before seeing the movie, I'd heard that some professional reviewers panned the movie because it was a downer in the second act. To which, I think my response was, ""Well... yeah! That's the ENTIRE POINT! The second act is when all of their happily-ever-afters fall apart because of the reckless choices they made in the first act, when they were seeking their own happily-ever-afters, without thought to the consequences."" The moral of the entire story can best be summed up by the words to the final song (emphasis mine):

""Careful the wish you make.
Wishes grow children.
Careful the path they take,
Wishes come true,
NOT FREE.
Careful the spell you cast,
Not just on children.
Sometimes, the spell may last
Past what you can see,
And turn against you.""

...and the moral is also in this line, from ""You Are Not Alone""
""CAREFUL... no one is alone.""
Stephen Sondheim once said that the most important word in that song is, ""careful.""

So, when I heard about professional reviewers, who really should know better, complaining that the second act is a ""downer,"" I initially wondered at HOW on Earth they could miss that... this was the entire point. But now... I think I understand how the point was missed.

The weird thing is, I really think that everybody did an excellent job with the movie adaptation. Everybody. But... something just got lost in the translation from stage to screen, and I really think that's not the fault of anybody in particular, or even of the movie. It's just the fault of the fact that it IS a movie, and not a stage production.

Audiences don't go to movies with the same mindset that they go to stage productions with. There are significant fundamental differences. For example, in a stage production, we just... automatically know that things aren't literal representations. That's a totally unconscious realization on the part of the audience, that colors everything about how we see the show. We see cardboard houses that are, in reality, about 10 feet apart, and we just know that those are houses in different places in the village.

Another example of the difference between the audience's mindset when watching a stage production vs. a movie: In the stage version of Into The Woods, Milky White is a cardboard cutout of a cow. At one point in the musical, the Baker tries to get Milky White to move. He pulls, to no avail. He pushes, to no avail. Finally, he gives up and picks Milky White up by the handle on the cardboard cutout's back, and walks off the stage with it. In a stage production, this is funny, not disruptive. But just TRY getting away with that in a movie (thankfully, they didn't do that in this movie)!

And we know to look for a moral in a stage musical, because there almost always IS a moral in a modern stage musical. So when the entire second act is dark and filled with death and loneliness and grief, we know that there's a REASON for that, so we NOTICE lyrics like the above, that explain... ""oh yeah. The second act is SUPPOSED to be this way, because this is the lesson it's trying to teach."" But in a movie theater, a lot of times, you don't necessarily notice those things, because we're trained to expect different things from movies than from stage productions.

And the humor is bigger on stage. There were times in the stage production when I, along with the rest of the audience, was in tears, I was laughing so hard. I counted 2 times in the movie when the audience laughed as a whole. The funny lines were there. They were delivered almost the same way they are on stage. But they just didn't seem as funny.

So... yeah. I think they made as good a movie as they could have, out of something that was made for the stage and probably should have stayed on the stage, because that's where it works best. It IS a good movie, and worth watching, but if you want to get the REAL experience, get the DVD of the original Broadway production.",1419984000,34,4596,4.536231884057971
6864079,2,B00Q7WBGHG,"INTO THE WOODS, the film, is Disney's production of the live musical of the same title (which, by the way, I have not seen and am uninfluenced by its success). It is, essentially, a synthesis of four Grimm Brothers' fairy tales  Cinderella, Little Red Riding Hood, Rapunzel, and Jack and the Beanstalk  into a larger fantasy stage managed, so to speak, by the ""witch next door"" to the village Baker and the Baker's Wife.

The film's first half, corresponding to Act 1 of the play, is clever enough to be almost-brilliant. The best performances in this half are by Meryl Streep as The Witch, Lilla Crawford as an edgy Little Red Riding Hood, and Johnny Depp's all too brief appearance as The Wolf. And the marital interaction between The Baker (James Corden) and The Baker's Wife (Emily Blunt) is nicely nuanced and should be familiar to anybody in the audience who's married.

Had Disney ended the film at the halfway point, which it easily could've, I would've awarded 4 or 5 stars. But, nooooo!

The second half, corresponding to the play's Act 2, is a complete muddle  an attempt at an extended morality play that was painfully awkward to watch. Sometimes you have to know when to cut your losses and quit. Nearing the end of INTO THE WOODS, I for one was tempted to just walk out. Disney's writers, when adapting the original script to the Big Screen, certainly should've at the lunch break had they had any sense of company tradition.

I can't imagine what the tradition-rich Disney Studio perceived as its target audience for this film; it's too dark for the kids, and adults may find it, at the end, to have been simply contrived to the point of stupidity (Well, the obvious target audience is that which liked the stage play. But that doesn't explain why Disney Studios should necessarily take it on. Walt Disney has to be rolling in his grave.)

Perhaps my generation that grew up with Disney productions since the 1950s might and should expect better. Personally taking that viewpoint is my only dog in the fight.",1419984000,12,2023,4.694915254237288
6864080,2,B00Q7WBGHG,"Its just fine. The movie looks great and the cast is very talented. But it's so watered down the from the original stage play that what we end up with is just a soap opera of sorts. I barely laughed in this movie...the exception being the princes during Agony. That was the only true moment they went full camp and riffed on fairy tales. A lot of my favorite lines and funny moments were missing or fell flat. What made Into the Woods such a wonderful play was the humor, wit, and subtext, where is any of that in this movie? Oh right, its because its Disney. I wish...it could have been amazing. I really wanted it to be!",1419984000,18,622,4.235294117647059
6864081,2,B00Q7WBGHG,"I really wanted to enjoy this film.  Having just had a very merry Christmas, I figured I would end the year on a movie musical high note - and so ventured forth into the world to see INTO THE WOODS.  Right off, with the title song I was immediately transported!  But, alas, not into the fairytale woods, but rather whisked away to the sleazy streets of Sweeney Todd's lugubrious London.  The title song has the same quirky bounce and rhythm as does the main title to that earlier musical. A composer's unavoidable fingerprints are one thing, but this was a ham-handed chokehold of that earlier tune. And then not too long into this dark film, who should appear but Sweeney himself, a.k.a. Johnny Depp, as the big bad wolf!  Deja vu!  I half-expected to see a barber's razor in his wolfman's hand and Angela Lansbury to pop out of her tree-house as Red Riding Hood's grandmother with a nice piping hot human meat pie!

Now, why was I thinking of Sweeney Todd through a great many of the songs in this film?  Simply because a large part of the music sounds like rejects from the score of Stephen Sondheim's SWEENEY TODD...as well as there being echoes of SUNDAY IN THE PARK WITH GEORGE and other scores by Sondheim.  And in listening to the last number in this film, I knew I had heard it before - and in heading to my car began whistling Leslie Bricusse's and Anthony Newley's ""The Candy Man Can"" from that other darkish children's film, WILLIE WONKA.  Now, it is one thing to imitate oneself, but to lift a snatch from someone else - even if subconsciously as George Harrison supposedly did with ""My Sweet Lord"" being lifted from the Chiffons ""He's So Fine"" - is another matter entirely.  Another irksome thing about Sondheim in many of his songs are the lyrics that are sung (by one or more singers)with a machine-gun rapidity - and as with many of the bullets fired from a machine gun, many of the lyrics simply, sadly miss their mark!  At least on a first hearing.  Afterwards, if one wishes to read the lyrics, one may be astounded at Sondheim's rich wordplay - but upon first listen, this technique of his can become more annoying than anything else.

In case one senses that I don't care for Sondheim, let me say unequivocally that SWEENEY TODD is an unmitigated masterpiece! But what works in the dark, deadly tale of the Fleet Street barber doesn't work so well in Sondheim's revisionist look at fairy tales. Here is the thing: fairy tales are fairy tales for a reason. They are told to make people hope and dream and aspire to living happily ever after. They are a window...into another world.  But in INTO THE WOODS, the window is broken a bit more than half-way through, and we are given a mirror instead.  And in that mirror we see how blameworthy everyone is for the ills of the world, how prejudiced we all are against the different, how blind that we cannot see the goodness in the witch and the wickedness in the baker's wife and how all of us are basically worthy of being dumped on.  The welcome window opened to a wondrous world is replaced with a completely uncalled for mirror meant to reveal the dark truths at the heart of even the most uplifting, courageous and romantic of tales.  Sadly, once the mirror was thrust into our faces, I could see over my shoulder, yes, a dark, back-row reflection of the smarmy makers of this film, the faces of the preaching producers, the didactic director with a superior smirk, the Disney folks hoping its audience got something more from their offering than mere...entertainment.  As if entertainment were not enough anymore!

I left the theater, glad that the mirror that had been thrust into the face of the audience was down.  I rather enjoyed the first two thirds of the fare. But the last third, the mirror part, was dull, meandering, unwelcome and utterly condescending. The world is ugly and unfair and cruel and narrow-minded enough and most people are smart enough to full-well know that. Fairy tales, alas, weren't really meant to be deconstructed.  Their structures were sound enough... before Sondheim! Just as one shouldn't tear the wings off of butterflies.  Some things are just best left alone.

ADDENDUM:  I never saw the musical play that is the source of this film.  However, having subsequently read up on it I can more fully appreciate the primary problem of the film version versus the stage version - and why it structurally seems like a three-legged topple-able table: so that Disney could have their cake and eat it also, large chunks of dark and un-Disney-esque material were hacked off of the source material, like the wicked sisters hacking off parts of their feet to fit the golden shoe! That didn't work for them - and it certainly doesn't work for this movie.

I understand that they had to change certain things to make it work on screen but the changes really don't hurt the overall sense of the original show. People should be aware that just because this is a Disney movie does not mean that it is for children or the faint-hearted, but they also use the fairy tales to teach great lessons about life and happiness.

I took my mom, who hasn't seen the musical, to see it, and she loved it as well, raving to her friends about it.

I understand how people who have not seen the musical were thrown off by the last quarter of the movie, but it wouldn't have been Into the Woods if they deleted parts in order to keep everything ""happily ever after"" and PC. That's not the point of this show. It's theme is about growing up, from being innocent to learning the truth about the world. You learn that things aren't always as they seem and to be careful what you wish for because you just may get it, and it may not be quite what you expected.  The characters' choices are all ridden with impending consequence. It's not bleak, it's reality, while reminding you of the good life holds as well.

No this is not your typical children's Disney movie like the classic animated originals, and I was actually pretty surprised at the PG rating. I suppose they kept it because none of the deaths were shown at all, only implied or discussed, but never set on film. There were several children in the theater with me, which I was also surprised to see, but they laughed and enjoyed the film. I think the deeper and darker themes flew right over their heads, and they simply enjoyed the stories, as children do.

If you have seen the musical or are a musical enthusiast, you will enjoy this! If you are an unsure parent, check it out beforehand. If you are looking for your usual, run-of-the-mill Disney movie, look elsewhere. Avoid unfairly rating a great movie because it wasn't the typical thing you expected. This movie is amazing!!!",1419724800,342,1793,4.4573170731707314

6864086,5,B00Q7WBGHG,"Into the Woods debuted on Broadway in October 1987, where it was greeted with great enthusiasm by critics and audiences alike.  The narrative is based on four fairy tales, using versions by the Brothers Grimm (Cinderella, Jack and the Beanstalk, Little Red Riding Hood and Rapunzel).  The plot blends the familiar tales with an original story about a baker and his wife and their attempts to undo a witch's spell.  The musical boasts music and lyrics by Stephen Sondheim, the most respected theatre composer of the last 60 years, and a book by his frequent collaborator, James Lapine.

Historically, fairy tales by the Grimm Brothers have been viewed as being darker and more realistic than versions of the same stories written by other authors.  Consequently, and because Mr. Sondheim is seen as one of the most (if not the most) challenging composers of modern theatre, it must be noted that Into the Woods is not a piece that was conceived with an audience of young children in mind.  Rather, it is a sophisticated adult experience, a fairy tale for grownups if you will.  While some of the darker and more provocative aspects of the story have been muted for the film version, the fact that the film has been produced by Disney has led many parents to assume that this is a film for small children.  It is not.  It is a moral fable for grownups; most children under the age of fifteen or so (unless they are very mature) will not be able to appreciate the story, and many parents of small children will find the material unsuitable.

For the uninitiated, Mr. Sondheim has long been known for his extremely clever rhymes, and his intellectually provocative lyrics and scenarios.  Since 1957, he has written both music and lyrics for such heralded shows as A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum, Anyone Can Whistle, Company, Follies, A Little Night Music, Merrily We Roll Along, Sweeney Todd, Pacific Overtures, Sunday in the Park with George, Assassins, Passion, Bounce and, of course, Into the Woods.  He also wrote the lyrics only for West Side Story, Gypsy and Do I Hear a Waltz.  Whole revues have been assembled around his songs and even the songs he'd dropped from shows before they reached Broadway.  Nevertheless, aside from the lyrics to West Side Story and his most successful song, Send in the Clowns, he is largely unknown to all but regular Broadway audiences.  Yet many audiences are already familiar with the stage version of Into the Woods, either from Broadway, touring companies or the DVD of the complete show (with the original cast).  Like most of Sondheim's other works, Into the Woods has been praised for its witty and intelligent lyrics and its extremely humorous book.  It has also proved to be one of his most popular endeavors.

Devotees of the stage work will find that, like Sweeney Todd before it, several cuts have been made in the story and music for the film version of Into the Woods.  Having purchased the soundtrack and now having seen the film twice, I would say that about one third of the story and one fifth of the music has been removed from the film version.  I was a bit more disappointed at the deletions of the choral portions of Sweeney Todd than I am in the music cut from Into The Woods.  The film works quite well, with a good deal of the music and humor intact.

The following songs have been deleted from the score for the movie:

I Guess This is Goodbye / Maybe They're Magic
First Midnight
Act II Prologue (So Happy)
Agony (Act II Reprise)

And the following songs have been replaced by instrumental versions:

Ever After (Instrumental)
No More (Instrumental)

This is not surprising; what is surprising is that so much of the score has been retained for the film.  The original stage show ran over three hours, plus the intermission.  The film clocks in at just over two hours, which means that more than an hour of music and plot have been trimmed.  Many may disagree, but I believe this makes for a tighter, more structured story and score.  Considering the length of the stage work, some cuts simply had to be made.

It is recommended that those previously unfamiliar with the score acquire the complete soundtrack (with the libretto included) and follow along with the words as the songs are sung.  The first thing you will realize is (as with any of Mr. Sondheim's works) how incredibly witty and sophisticated the lyrics are; on first listen you may miss most of his delicious wit.  His use of the language, his clever rhymes, and his intelligent, deft semantics will amaze anyone who takes the time to listen.  There are reasons why so many consider Sondheim the foremost composer of the theatre, and so many intelligent theatergoers hang on his every word.  Into the Woods is no exception, despite the cuts.

The cast of the film, led by Meryl Streep, Anna Kendrick and James Corden are uniformly excellent.  I expected a faithful adaptation of Into the Woods as soon as I heard that the film was being directed by Rob Marshall, who brought the musical Chicago to the screen.  Mr. Marshall presented a faithful adaptation of Chicago, and once again he does not disappoint.

All in all, Into the Woods is a towering achievement.  Few of Sondheim's musicals have been successfully transplanted to cinema.  Into the Woods may very well be the best of them.

Highly recommended.",1419724800,142,5349,4.719827586206897
6864087,3,B00Q7WBGHG,"I didn't come to the movie with any preconceived notions.  I rather enjoyed the first half, as it is filled with wonderfully clever plot developments and some delightful humor.  The second half deconstructs the happy ending and is significantly darker.  The ending isn't bleak, but it isn't as pleasant as the first half's.  After a while into the second half, it got hard for me to keep watching because of the pessimistic outlook and the ceaseless visual darkness of the woods.  I spent a while afterward trying to figure out what I should gain from the experience.  Is there something thematically more meaningful in the musical than that everyone makes mistakes and that we should learn from 'em and take risks and be courageous?  I didn't feel inspired to be a better person, and was mostly relieved that it was over because I didn't have to worry about another character dying or characters getting into more fights with each other.  Usually when a theme is powerfully presented, I don't have to wonder if I understood the movie's intent.  Part of my confusion is because there's a song in the second half about how everyone has to find their own path to what works, and do the best they can to be good people, but it is so vague and leaves everyone to find their own moral path, rather than establishing some unchanging ideal we can aspire to.  The music didn't engage me very much, as composer and lyricist Stephen Sondheim's musical style in this somewhat resembles Stravinsky in what he does with rhythm, emphasis, and melody.  (Not his ""Rite of Spring"", but ""The Soldier's Tale"".)  But the words in the songs are very clever a lot of times, which I like.  In the end, the movie gives me a puzzled feeling because it's really great as a whimsical story connecting the different fairy tales, until the second half gets philosophical about the meaning of morality and how to rebuild from losses, asking a lot of questions but not providing answers.  Life gives me enough reminders of such burdens, and I usually like works of art better when they give answers or ideals to aspire to.  If the Into the Woods musical makes this clearer, I wouldn't know; I just know the movie version doesn't.",1419724800,25,2198,4.6875
6864088,1,B00Q7WBGHG,"This was the worst Disney movie I've seen in my life.  If I hadn't been blocked in the row, I would have left after the first 1.5 hours.  The music was not memorable even though each song sounded essentially the same. Five minutes after the show I couldn't sing even one of the songs from memory.  Maybe it works well on Broadway but as a movie, no.  There are no happy endings and limited morals.  One can say it is a clever twist on the classic stories but I go to the theater to escape the every day world and to hope for a happy ending.  The movie should have ended where expected and it would have ended on a good moral note, saved half of an hour of my life, and I would have given it three or four stars.

6864089,1,B00Q7WBGHG,"I Repeat! This A Very, Very Disturbing Film Not Suitable For Children Or Preteens. Into The Woods is a sick, twisted story that is beyond bad or rotten. It tells that audience that unless you are a newborn baby everyone - no matter what your age or social class - is corrupt and despicable! (If you want to see a fantasy film that is the best I've ever seen in my life then buy Hallmark's & Jim Henson's ""Jack and the Beanstalk - The Real Story."" It is suitable for all ages and you may even cry your brains out while watching it the first time, like I did!)

I've never before seen a movie that should have been rated PG-13 or R rated PG. Never in my life - and I have been going to movies for at least 45 YEARS! Let me ask you this: Is three separate acts of thievery of an  innocent individual's most valuable possessions - that leads to an act of manslaughter by a child, no less, worthy of only a PG rating? Then add another act of manslaughter, with the assistance of all the adults around him worthy of just a PG rating? Then another act of manslaughter by an adult killing the child's mother worthy of just a PG rating? Then the accidental death of another adult hero worthy of just a PG rating? How about leaving a new born child with a pre-teen with zero babysitting experience, as if that was not a big deal, worthy of just a PG rating. How about a kidnapper isolating her alleged daughter first in a castle with no escape, then in a rather flimsy hut made of twigs - in a swamp in the middle of nowhere - worthy of just a PG rating? How about one of the characters that was murdered looking exactly like an elderly grandmother is that worthy of only a PG rating? Or how about a flock of birds pecking out the eyes of two women is that worthy of only a PG rating? In the world of ""Into the Woods"" blindness is funny! How sick and twisted can you get? How about a totally innocent man having his eyes poked out by thorn bushes, is that worthy of only a PG rating. (Does it really matter if he is innocent or or not, this film was rated PG!) And last, but not least, let's not forget one women having their toe cut off and another having there heel of their foot cut off? Wow! I've never seen acts amputation to be hilarious until now (I'm being sarcastic!) Is that worthy of only a PG rating?

This Film Is So Bad It Is Making Me Feel Nauseous! I may even throw-up by the end of the night! Most people have better things to do then write a movie review when they feel this sick to their stomach. But if I help prevent one young person or adult from seeing this film and being deceived and traumatized, like I was, then it's well worth the effort.

I want to make it clear there are NO good guys in this film. I could care less about any of the characters except for the newborn child and the two murdered giants. Whoever had anything to do with this film knew exactly what they were doing. If adults want to see sick and twisted be my guest! But to market this as a movie suitable for children and then to have the film's rating gamed in order to maximize profits is an act of evil, plain and simple! Sorry, but I call a spade a spade. What I would like to really say will be censored, so let your imagination run wild!

On the subject of maximizing profits: Ticket sales are considerably down from last year and you wonder why? I was looking forward to seeing two other movies. Now I'm not going to see them! Hollywood and movie theater owners you made $11.50 off of me! Now you're going to loose because you would have made $34.50 had you not gamed the rating. I don't care in slightest how good the other films might be. I'll wait till I can buy them for a PENNY on Amazon! Now multiply that by lots of people across the world and I don't care how palatial you build your new  movie theaters - I have zero interest in stepping inside! Zero! Zero! Zero! Antagonizing your loyal customers by trying to boost your quarterly statement at the expense of your annual statement is dumb, dumb, dumb! Hasn't anyone in Hollywood taken Accounting 101? Hollywood, use that evil genius of yours for good and you will make more money, not less! Duh!",1419638400,17,4148,4.211320754716981

Remember that one? It's the first song that launches this perennial stage musical. I have seen it numerous times, most recently a spectacular version in Ashland, Oregon, staged at the Shakespearean Festival.

Now it passes into the capable hands of Rob Marshall (""Chicago"") who is someone we can trust with a well-loved musical. He did it right! The first act evokes familiar childhood stories, ""Little Red Riding Hood,"" ""Jack and the Beanstalk,"" ""Cinderella,"" and ""Rapunzel,"" with The Baker and His Wife woven in for continuity. It's constructed as a sort of scavenger hunt. Of course that's the part where they all live ""happily ever after."" The next section is what happens AFTER the ""happily ever after."" (Composer Stephen Sondheim MUST be in therapy!)

A stage musical this well known draws out musical theater fans. It was fun to hear the screening audience applaud after a song, much like we would do in ""live"" theater. The actors not only articulated like stage actors, the sound engineering is terrific! No murmuring, no whispers and no missed dialogue. Whew! This is important because much of the music contains witty lyrics.

Here is part of this huge, capable cast:
  * Lilla Crawford (TV Host) Red Riding Hood goes headlong into the woods to Grandmother's house but she's a little bit scared.
  * Johnny Depp (""Lucky Them"") The Wolf teaches Red Riding Hood a valuable lesson when he finds her in the woods. ""Hello, little girl!""
  * Anna Kendrick (""Pitch Perfect"") Cinderella will be just fine, if the birds keep helping her.
  * Christine Baranski (""The Good Wife"") Cinderella's Stepmother will go to any lengths to find the perfect husband...for her less-than-perfect daughters.
  * Chris Pine (""Star Trek"") Cinderella's Prince is a charming fellow.... He has my favorite punch line.
  * Meryl Streep (""August: Osage County"") The Witch is packing a lot of malice and in her mind it's justified. It's not HER fault!
  * Mackenzie Mauzy (Lots of TV) Lonely Rapunzel knows that she wants... something ...and it isn't just visits from her mother, the Witch, so she sings a haunting melody.
  * Billy Magnussen (""Boardwalk Empire"") Rapunzel's Prince is in agony when the one thing he wants is the thing he can't have.
  * James Corden (""Begin Again"") The Baker wants a son...period! But he's not sure how to be a father. He's not good; he's not bad; he's just nice.
  * Emily Blunt (""Edge of Tomorrow"") The Baker's Wife can't understand why she has never had a baby, so she believes The Witch's story. It takes two....
  * Daniel Huttlestone (Gavroche in ""Les Miserables"") is Jack, who traded his beloved Milky White for a handful of beans.
  * Tracey Ullman (""How I Met Your Mother"") Jack's Mother is at her wit's end trying to raise such a simple boy.

This two-hour, PG-rated collaboration between Disney, Lucamar and Marc Platt Productions depicts fairy tales, so expect some computer generated imaging but no sweaty bodies or profanity. Each actor has his or her moment in the spotlight and each one shines! It would be impossible to pick a favorite actor, scene, song or situation, although Chris Pine and Emily Blunt are perfectly cast! ...and that waterfall bit is delicious.... ...and Wyatt Smith's editing for ""It's Your Fault"" is lickety-split... and... Stop me or I'll go on and on and on...

I like the message, ""Be careful what you wish for...""",1419638400,18,3381,4.901408450704225

While I could feel the brilliance, it felt long to watch, not seeing it live. The film however seemed somewhat compressed, and that made the pacing much better for me.

Watching the video of the stage showthought I so respected the brilliance of the writing, directing, and performingI got a bit squirmy and bored, but with the film, I loved each song and was motivated to keep going through all the twists and turns. I could sink into the complexities and layers in the lyrics, and could get into the characters/performances. I also enjoyed the social commentary more. (I'm sure a good live performance would have the same effect.)

I disagree with the writer who doesn't like film actors in this. I didn't like the ""musical"" professional who played Cinderella. Though her singing was beautiful, I found her delivery of lines flat. The actors familiar with the camera felt more authentic. And yeah, Emily Blunt was brilliant!",1534032000,,1062,4.861878453038674

8690833,4,B00Q7WBGHG,"""Into the Woods"" began as a Broadway musical under the genius of Stephen Sondheim and James Lapine. Perhaps, it's perhaps their best Broadway musical. Rob Marshall (Academy Award winner of ""Chicago"" musical) directs this production and stayed true to the musical format. Meryl Streep played the witch and did a fantastic job in her performance. The all star cast included James Corden, Emily Blunt, Johnny Depp, Anna Kendrick, Christine Baranski and more. The film is a bit dark for me. The fairy tales include Cinderella, Rapunzel, the childless Baker couple, Jack and the Beanstalk, Little Red Riding Hood and more.

So they take all those children's tales and build a Sondheim musical to it. It was really genius and ahead of its time. Audiences will find the film to be entertaining and delightful if you don't let the darkness bother you. The stories are timeless and really quite sad especially Cinderella's abuse, Rapunzel's isolation; and the infertile Baker couple who desperately want to be parents.
