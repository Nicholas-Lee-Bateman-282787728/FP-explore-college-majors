7813477,5,6301570677,"Indigo Girls -- playing purely acoustic in a tiny club in Decatur, Georgia, without a band.  Sheer perfection---if there is a **best** way to see Indigo Girls live, this is certainly it: a small, intimate setting before a small but enthusiastic college crowd.  The reviewer who claimed ""the two female voices were not as harmonized as in later years"" is plainly absurd.  The Girls do harmonize of course but their greatest strength, in my view, is their ability to sing in beautiful counterpoint.  They do both brilliantly here and Emily is positively smokin' on lead acoustic guitar.  Features a surprise appearance by Michael Stipe of R.E.M. who simply walks on stage in the middle of a song and delivers his part on ""Kid Fears"" with astonishing power and feeling.  This performance alone in worth the full price of the DVD alone (and that's pretty high now since this item is out-of-print).",1486857600,,893,4.880794701986755

It's a shame that the Uptown Lounge isn't around anymore, but this video is a good testament to a bar band that made it big.",1360454400,,248,4.511111111111111

7813483,2,6301570677,"I had seen the Indigo Girls on Jay Leno TV show back in 1994-95, and they were very good.  So recently I decided to purchase their early years DVD ""Live at the Uptown Lounge"" from 1990.  I found it to be a disappointment.  There was no back-up band, the two female voices were not as harmonized as in later years, they were dressed poorly, and the sound/picture quality was not as good.  The two singers are young and enthusiastic in this DVD concert, as are their audience members.  But overall, not worth the purchase price.",1237852800,,526,4.494736842105263

7813485,5,6301570677,"Chick bands are my thing.  Without a doubt, if you are a chick band type of person, you'll find this DVD stellar.  Had the VHS version for years.  Although some will be stand-offish for the whole lesbian scene issue,...give these ladies credit.  The strumming of the guitars hangs thick in the Indigo Lounge air while the vocals strike with unparalleled accuracy.  I've had friends watch this DVD who wouldn't even have thought about buying an IG DVD.  The moment they witness this concert, they are off to their favorite music purchase outlet to get their hands around this one.  Repeat performance that you'll never tire of.  Guarantee.",1136592000,10,638,4.897196261682243
7813486,4,6301570677,"a fun-loving and frolicsome journey through the creativity and determination of a truly unique band.

If you can get past the silly fashions and very casual format of this video, you can peer into the heart of two women who stuck to their guns and forged ahead into true mastery of an enjoyable and enduring niche within the fickle music industry.",1104969600,,347,4.688524590163935
