It is a well rounded movie about Romeo Rajkumar who is involved in the drug world but gets caught between the two feuding drug families when the woman he falls in love with is the woman that his boss has determined to marry! Stellar movie!",1398816000,3,366,4.097222222222222
6208228,5,B00HU60DRM,"This is a classic prabhu deva film... IT's very action packed and masti just like we all like. The  fighting is as usual over the top but that's why we watch them, right? I loved the songs they immediately stick in your head and shahid dancing with prabhu is awesome! I also liked sunakshi's character in this, it was a new twist to her usual masala films. She was quite tough and fiesty and shahid following her with pursed lips everytime he saw her was hilarious! Get ready for fun just don't expect too much depth, this is pure action comedy!!",1397174400,3,546,4.405940594059406

8635759,5,B00HU60DRM,"This show blew my mind. I loved the twists. The action was well balanced with the music. The dancing was incredible, but I really have come to expect that from Shahid Kapoor. It was his acting that shocked me. So dynamic and different from other characters he has played.",1447027200,,271,4.551020408163265

8635763,1,B00HU60DRM,"I have seen hundreds of Bollywood movies but very few are as annoying as this one. Sexist, poor story, weak acting; where does it end? Not to sure as I stopped the movie about half way! My hubby agrees too that it is really a poor movie with a very outdated and boring plot.",1409875200,,274,4.092592592592593
