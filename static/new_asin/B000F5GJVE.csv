2552065,5,B000F5GJVE,"Just like many of you...I am now 22 years old and still look back on my tv shows I used to watch on Nickelodeon.  Slaute Your Shorts, Hey Dude, and Are You Afraid of the Dark (to name a few) have all given me great memories.  Thank GOD they put this out on DVD.  I just got mine today and watched the first 2 episodes....I couldn't believe how much I remember!  I thought that maybe (since I am alot old now) I wouldn't like it as much....but I was wrong...this is something to watch forever and one day show my kids what good ""teen TV"" used to be like.  Get the DVD!  NOW JUST BRING MORE OF THESE KINDS OF SHOWS ONTO DVD!!!!",1169596800,15,625,4.040650406504065
2552066,5,B000F5GJVE,"Remember when you could watch great shows on Nick at Night?? Are you afraid of the dark centers on friends that gather around a campfire and tell scary tales. While the show certainly hasn't aged all that well with costumes and effects- the spook factor has. I am 24 and have been looking for this series since tv shows started appearing on dvd sets and finally they are here. I still love this show. The characters around the campfire are not the stars- the scary stories they tell take center stage. We're not talking blood and gore but stories where little girls are trapped on the other side of a mirror, or a teenage ghost is still waiting in a grave yard for her boyfriend to take her prom, or a pair of cheap glasses let you see an another dimension, or vampires move in next door and your mother invites them in. This is still spooky and the stories don't always end happily. The seasons episodes are as follows.

1. The Phantom Cab

2. The Lonely Ghost

3. Laughing in the Dark

4. The Twisted Claw

5. The Hungry Hounds

6. The Prom Queen

7. The Captured Souls

8. The Nightly Neighbors

9. The Dark Music

10. Jake and the Leprechaun

11. The Super Specs

12. The Sorcerer's Apprentice

13. The Pinball WIzard

If you are a fan of the show you must also pick up season 2. One sour note- this dvd set was not made with an outer cover. Oh well. I got over it!",1167004800,48,1369,4.255813953488372
2552067,5,B000F5GJVE,"Though there's no purchase link, at least there is some type of DVD set out there!  I purchased mine off of Ebay (the ""complete"" series, although it's missing a few episodes) and I'll wait until Nickelodeon comes out with their own DVD set.  Maybe this will light a fire under their butts to get an official set out there!!",1151107200,,323,4.4576271186440675
2552068,5,B000F5GJVE,I grew up watching this show as well. Considering it has 13 shows on it I'm sure any Are You Afraid of The Dark fan will love it. I had no problems with shipping or with video wharehouse like the first reviewer. I got mine very quickly and would certainly tell anyone who wants the first season to get it right here.,1150416000,7,316,4.112903225806452

2552082,3,B000F5GJVE,As others have stated this is just a collection of assorted episodes across season into a volume. Quality is as decent you could expect something from the 90s but to release a series like this is disengenuous.,1485648000,2,209,4.675675675675675

2552086,5,B000F5GJVE,"This show is a classic.  I was born in 1982 and grew up on this show.  I love the stories, the actors, and how there are enough scenes to make small children jump, but not terrified.  My 6 year old son loves this show, and at 34 years old so do I still :)  The early seasons are the best in my opinion, but I still love all seasons of this show.",1480896000,,345,3.75
2552087,5,B000F5GJVE,"I think some of the episodes are a bit out of order, like if you watch volume one and it says  these people left the show they moved away, but in Volume 2  they are back??  not sure  if that was an amazon mistake or nicks  but i love this show,  its my favorite from when I was a kid . Now my son is watching it too, so awesome!",1480377600,,328,3.6142857142857143
2552088,4,B000F5GJVE,"Though this show is a bit dated, the storylines in some episodes are very strong.

2552099,5,B000F5GJVE,"I love this program, even though the segments aren't that long, but they do captivate you for the subject matter is what is interesting and you have to watch it because you need to know what's going to happen next. It's like a mystery within a mystery and that's what I've always enjoyed a mystery, yet many can be spooky, some turn out good and some turn out bad since life is like that too. A great program to watch...",1476144000,,420,4.2625

2552101,3,B000F5GJVE,"I LOVE this show. But these episodes aren't from Season 1. Where's the Tale of the Phantom Cab, where Frank first gets introduced into the Midnight Society?

I don't like how the episodes were split into volumes, instead of being in its original order by season....but I can deal. :)",1474070400,,147,4.481481481481482

2552107,3,B000F5GJVE,"Very disappointed that this series is released as ""Volumes"" and not ""Seasons."" It doesnt make any sense. I would have gladly bought them all if they were in fact in chronological order. I mean take a look at the last Volume. it only has like 4 episodes but costs the same as the rest. Obviously episodes have been left out and it is just a mess of a collection. I absolutely love this show and wish I could purchase it correctly.",1473379200,10,429,4.308641975308642

I took a chance and watched an episode with my six year old  she did not follow the story so much more suited for 8-11 years old. Stories are a lot like the Goosebumps show. Turn the lights off, pop some kernels, and prepare yourself for some small scares and family time.

2552178,5,B000F5GJVE,"I recently started watching this series via Amazon Prime because my 5 yr old was bored with PBS. She seems to enjoy scary stories, so her dad found Are You Afraid of the Dark and the Goosebumps series in streaming for her.

These stories are absolutely fantastic. They originally premiered in the early to mid 90s during my late teens and early 20s, but I never saw them... I'm not sure if they weren't broadcast on network television back then (as my household did not have cable) or if I just wasn't interested because they were marketed to younger teens, but man did I miss out!

The young actors and actresses in this series played their roles well, the stories were wonderfully written and directed and they are actually scary. Another treat? Every show seems to have some type of dilemma that needs to be solved or handled in an ethical way. In other words, each episode encourages ethics, morality and character building which is a far cry from what most shows geared towards tweens and teens offer today.

Currently in my 40s, I actually enjoy sitting down with my daughter to watch the stories. Some of them are too scary for her, but luckily she is self-aware enough to tell me when to turn an episode off due to this. We both love them and will be sad once we've completed all of the seasons.

Are You Afraid of the Dark is an awesome, family friendly TV show that is fun, engrossing and interesting to watch. The clothes, hairstyles and vernacular are a bit dated, but the stories more than make up for that.

Watch these with your kids   they are great!",1430956800,,1566,4.512367491166078

Volume 1 has been a good mix of haunted house, poltergeists, and even a nod to Washington Irving's The Legend of Sleepy Hollow. I find the acting in this series to be above average and the Midnight Society intro to each episode is a nice touch.

Yes, there is a cheese factor here but it's all in the spirit of fun and mayhem. There is no offensive language and the scare factor is neither too low nor high, making it perfect for the tween crowd.",1418515200,,652,4.344262295081967

2552336,4,B000F5GJVE,"Surprisingly timeless, the storytelling is excellent. Volume 1 is a great sampler of Are You Afraid of the Dark? episodes; however, I took off a star because it is not the entirety of any single season. I watch these to be nostalgic, and I wanted to start from the beginning and go in order. It turns out that requires a lot of jumping around between volume sets. Otherwise, still a great show.",1409961600,,394,4.486111111111111

I watched this show as a child and now my two little girls (3&7) and I watch it together!!
The episodes are not too scary, no gruesome killing or murders, and no profanity!! I have noticed some bullying but it tends to go along with the story and end up working to where the bully realizes his mistake kinda thing.

This is not a bad show in the sense that it has great writing and although avoids showing a lot of detail because it is obviously crafted for a younger audience it still has some fun horror elements. Great for a trip down memory lane and brought about a lot of nostalgia. Highly recommended if you watched the show when it aired.

However, once I finished all the episodes I realized that about half the episodes are missing from each season. They are also out of order as if someone just picked the most popular episodes. I wish the instant video had the full seasons because I would love to see all the episodes. This is why I only gave it a 4.

Now being 29 years old, obviously it isn't scary to me at all but it is freaking awesome to watch! I just finished viewing season one on amazon prime instant video and can't wait to watch the rest. I used to watch a bunch of nickelodeon shows back in the early to mid 90's and this was one of my favorites. Sometimes the stories can be a bit corny and the clothing bad(it was the 90's though lol), but the acting is pretty darn good for kids. If you have kids I think it's a good show to watch with them or just to reminisce by yourself. I am not sure why, but season 7 seems like you have to purchase it to view it or rent it and pay for that also. hopefully, season 7 will be on amazon prime instant soon.",1391558400,,825,4.036585365853658

It would be one thing if the volume was at least half a season.  But instead it is a random seeming collection of episodes. Which was super confusing when they kept going through Midnight Society Members.

So, over all the same great show you remember from childhood, that still holds up well.  But it is made up of 7 random episodes over the whole series.",1383696000,,520,4.255102040816326

There's definitely a sense of nostalgia for me when watching these. This, along with the other shows they aired during SNICK, were staples of my childhood.

Sure, the stories aren't as scary as they seemed back then, but they're still some good stuff. The look and feel of the show is definitely dated, but that can easily be ignored. The one real problem that I have is that this is just a volume collection, not an actual season. It was a little off-putting to be told that a couple storytellers moved, and then the next episode in the volume has them back. Not a huge pain, but just a little annoyance. I'd much rather these be in seasons, and in the right order.",1381536000,,821,4.3311688311688314

Still, this show has provided me with many fantastic evenings of drinking games with friends, all while getting to re-watch episodes from my childhood that resulted in recurring nightmares for years to come. One drink for every outrageous 90s haircut, 2 drinks if you had said haircut in the 90s, drink for smoke machine (get ready... it's a lot), drink anytime parents are absent, negligent, or just all around awful. This happens often as the show tried to use as few adult actors as possible in order to not have to pay as much money. There are several other rules that you can easily look up online, but you get the idea.

I remember watching this series on Nickelodeon's Snick, years ago. The case these discs come in is overall cool! The DVD's aren't as easy to get out as other DVD cases....but it's not har either. The picture quality is not widescreen, nore HD. They are as we all watched them in the 90's. Standard format and average picture. But none the less the picture is fine. It looks fine/good on a LCD, & in a Blu-ray player too! I have my Blu-ray player set up so it does play this set in widescreen. And I use HDMI, & it looks good. The sound is good quality for it's age also. This set has the entire first season (13 episodes) and comes w/ a bonus episode. The opening is slightly different from what I remember. It starts off the same. Then has extra music and footage of episodes. It's all good though. It may be due to being manufactured in Canada. They may have aired the opening that way in Canada. If you used to watch & follow this show (especially with the original cast) you won't be let down buying this set! I've seen this set sell on here for about $115.00. Me personally....I wouldn't pay nearly that, even though I watched this like crazy back in the day! I paid $25.00 for it. And I think that is well worth it! If you happen to find this DVD set for even around $40.00 you may wanna get it. I guess people are saying it is hard to find.

That being said, this was great, but it's a tease to only give us a Vol 1. chunk of episodes and not have the rest of the series available on instant video.  The one with Zeebo the clown is too scary to watch, anyway, so it feels like I only got 6 of the 7 episodes.

Episode five has Ashley Banks (Fresh Prince Will Smith's cousin) in it. It also features an ethnically vague family with the last name ""Johnston"".  Haha, get real Canada.  Kiki really fudged the details on this tale.

2552623,5,B000F5GJVE,"Arguably the best of Nick At Night. This series was written extremely well, and it shows in the longevity, sheer success and growing interest people have in the sets. In fact, 7 seasons is more than enough to prove you belong with the best of the best in Nick Shows. While not gory in any way, they built on fear, terror and madness the likes of which have not been seen since Twilight Zone.

In fact, AYAOTD is so good, one could call it a golden stepchild of shows like Twilight Zone. Enter some of the Very Best Told Stories ever concocted for a television set:
  (1)  Tale Of the Phantom Cab:  the all time favorite and best ghost story to hit a television show and done superbly!! My only small minor gripe with it is the actual naming of the show title, which i think makes the episode itself lose some power/effect. If the audience hadnt been initially tipped off like that before the show began... vastly different effect!

  (2)Tale of the Final Wish:  hideous, scary and downright disturbing that dreams, fairytales and wishes could come true, entwine into your reoccuring fears and terrorize you in ways no one could have ever thought possible, like floating ominous clocks and sleeping relatives unable to wake up and help you.

  (3) Tale of Laughing In The Dark: One of my Three all time favorites. Never has such a scary clown ever come out to ghoulishly stalk a nasty little boy bent on theft of property. Only through cigars, burn microwave dishes and taunting fun houses do we finally get closure to an evil presence bent on revenge. IT by Stephen King was tied with this episode to me... very creepy!  By the way: The Tale of the Crimson Clown on this set: took clowns to an entirely new hideously nightmarish level, the likes of which I cant even begin to describe!

  (4)  Tale of the Pinball Wizard:  One of my Three Favorites, fabulous use of pinball machines in pure golden Twilight Zone form. Well done, bravo and sheer brilliance to boot. The writers must have Twilight Zone in their blood because it was a PERFECT extension of it, in all its glory and writing perfection.

  (5)  Tale of the Silver Sight:  Many people don't like this 3 part set. It is my final favorite. They bring back old AYAOT members, inject terrible curses in real day life and make it a hunt to the end, regardless of the  consequences. Someone or something is going to pay for the sadness and torment in the past, one way or another!",1284163200,4,2435,4.519450800915332

2552625,5,B000F5GJVE,"I am almost 19, and used to watch this show when I was younger. Looking back at these episodes, they aren't that scary, just very odd and witty. A lot of these episodes, especially the early ones, were quite cheesy, but i like it that way.

The beauty of this show is that it appeals to kids, teens, and young adults, making it very accessible (Ex: kid themes for kids, teen themes for teens, adult themes for adults--generally; no sex or vulgarity or violence).

It has awesome actors like Daniel DeSanto (who plays Ray Kon on Beyblade) and Rachael Blanchard (who plays Sally on Flight of the Conchords)

I thought that the packaging was pretty cool. Cookie Jar, the distributor for the series, spoke truly with the quote on the box that said ""TV for the thinking teen"", and a series like this really DOES make you think.

I'm a big fan of retro Nickelodeon, and this is one of my favorites. Get this if you haven't already. It's frightening fun, and nostalgia for Nickelodeon nerds like me :D",1260576000,,994,4.5363128491620115

AYAOTD? is by far my favorite non-Nicktoon Nick show of all time, and my third favorite TV series!

2552637,5,B000F5GJVE,"Okay, I'd like to clear up a few things about these dvd sets. ""Are You Afraid of the Dark"" was one of my favorite shows as a kid and I almost didn't buy this dvd set, I'm glad I did. Alot of peolpe are wondering if these are bootlegs. They are not. They are 100% authentic dvds. THe show was a canadian show that Nickelodeon co-produced and released in America. The dvds are from the canadian company. Don't expect a Nickelodeon rlease of the show. They seem quite content screwing over fans of early 90's Nick, by cnacleing the release the final season of Pete and Pete, and not putting any of Salute Your Shorts on dvd either. The biggest issue people were worried about with these dvds was The first seasons packaging. It is a tri fold out cardboard case, like a standard tv show dvd is. The problem is, it doesn't include an outer sleeve to put it into. It's supposed to be that way, so don't worry. Not the best packaging, but it works. The other 2 seasons that were released do include an outer sleeve, which I definitly prefer, but the first season is acceptable. The dvds are of great quality, the picture and sound qaulity is great too. Don't expect remastered in surround sound and high def, but they are better than your average tv broadcast quality. Another question people had was about the changed opening. The first season has a changed opening. They cut the regualr opening short and added a bunch of scenes from the show cut to the credits music. Season 2 and 3 have the original opening you all remember and love. And finally, the question of altered scenes in episodes. In the first season, The Tale of The Hungry Hounds, a scene in the begining is cut where the main characters friend jumps out and scares her in the attic. It cuts akwardly instead to her reacting and doesbn't make any sense in the context. I don't know why thet did it, but the episode is far from ruined with that 5 second scene excised. The only other part thet changed was the song at the end of the Prom Queen episode. They changed it because they lost the rights to the song. Again, not a big deal, but be forewarned. These dvds are definitly worth the price, and they will play in your dvd player. They are Region 1 which is North America and Canada so don't worry. They are not available in American stores as far as I know, so ebay and amazon are your best bet for getting them. Hope this helped to clear up a few things, and let's hope they put out the rest of the incredible show soon!",1182124800,115,2484,4.355603448275862
