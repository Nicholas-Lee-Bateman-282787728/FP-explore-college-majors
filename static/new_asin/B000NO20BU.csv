8179832,3,B000NO20BU,"This is a good addition to your climbing video collection, a tribute to Derek H is included.",1282003200,,92,4.470588235294118
8179833,5,B000NO20BU,"I first saw clips of this film as part of the Banff Mountain Film festival a few years ago. They showed clips of Timmy buildering around town and of Biscuit the rock climbing dog. Hilarious stuff. The rest of the DVD is also quite good. The only part that I did not love was the protracted tribute to Derek Hersey. This segment was too long, too complimentary, and guilty of over-glorifying a practice (free-soloing) that really should not be glorified. However, don't let my brief climbing ethics rant dissuade you. This  is a brilliant film.",1111708800,3,543,4.71578947368421
