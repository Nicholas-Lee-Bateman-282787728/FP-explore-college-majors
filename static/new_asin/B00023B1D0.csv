8170517,4,B00023B1D0,"The movie depicts a true story on how a woman is hooked on an early extreme experience, and leaves a quiet, pleasant , ordinary, problem free life for prosecuting a career on her perversion. Never a medical lesson was so good explained, and few times ""common"" people acts better told. When I was a child, a school mate told me that movie makers were running out of subjects, romans and ancient mitology and western's subjects exhausted, and I had the idea that psychiatrist's offices would be a very good source of ideas. That film proves that the concept was not so bad. Enjoy an special part of every day's spanish life!",1179705600,2,622,4.612612612612613
