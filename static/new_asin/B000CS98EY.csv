It is in the authoritarian and industrial regimes/dictatorships that architecture gives shape to so much so quickly that the face of the powerful plasters everything in less than a lifetime.

Nicolae Margineanu, the film's director, relies on a book (Ioan Augustin's ""Architecture and Power"") to vividly illustrate the relationship between the Romanian power and architecture during the second half of the 20th century.  The lens focuses rather on Bucharest, the Romanian capital.  Architecture of modern Bucharest is rooted in Romanian traditions, French culture, various currents of the day (e.g. the Italian fascism, Stalinist, Bauhaus, North Korean [...],) or simply the personality of the leaders.  In fact, for the removed viewer, the drama of this work comes precisely from, and round, the People's House (at present, Parliament Palace) as Ceausescus' persona.

When talking about the film and the director's work, I would like to start with a couple of limitations: a) its short duration (52min); and b) its scope as limited by the short time lapsed between the fall of communism and the making of the film.  Despite these limitations, this film is, and will likely remain, of high value.  To begin with, it establishes early the associations between the Romanian communist power and its buildings/habitat.  I should probably add that buildings and their context are the support of, and eventually become, our daily lives.  Consequently, one is able to explain a great deal of a dysfunctional society by looking at the surrounding buildings.  Over time, as we learn more about communism and its societies, more will be revealed and better relationships established.  ""Power and Architecture"" will remain even then valuable by offering a timely relevant and vivid series of illustrations of a hugely dysfunctional society, which we call communism.",1200355200,,1994,5.372990353697749

8101717,5,B000CS98EY,"This documentary succeeds in showing how the architect in his submission to the powerful changes the spirit of the city.

Duiliu Marcu, one of the architects featured, managed to serve King Carol II in his efforts to leave his mark on Bucharest, creating the Victoria Palace and War School in the ""stille littorio"" promoted by Piacentini in Fascist Italy, but also serving the communists, later on. Is it possible the architects serving Ceausescu (in his attempt to recreate North Korea in the middle of Europe) may have taken a page from their predecessor, Duiliu Marcu?

Bucharest is a lovely city and its buildings help you understand the uneasy relation between architecture and power.",1137542400,3,689,5.088495575221239
