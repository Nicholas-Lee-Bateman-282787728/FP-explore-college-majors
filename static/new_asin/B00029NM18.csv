I'm not so completely thrilled with the first episode on the DVD where they introduce the string instruments, but that might be because I am a music teacher- maybe I am over-critical.  I do love the episode on styles of music!

I have noticed that some of the music education catalogs are starting to carry this DVD for a ""rainy day"" school classroom movie.",1126656000,8,518,4.586956521739131

live at the mall. I was to impressed with them. They gave me a sample dvd wich I took to my daughters daycare to show the children. They love HI5 . Not only does this group teach the children they also make them get up and move to the music.
This morning I took a news letter to the daycare to tell the parents Hi 5 dvds are coming out thats how much I love HI 5!!",1090195200,6,427,3.7555555555555555

8024419,5,B00029NM18,"Because of my grandkids-I have become a devoted fan of Hi-5. I purchased many of the DVD's and believe it or not-repetitive watching of these is NOT boring at all! We love to sing, jump, laugh and imitate this high energy group with their role playing and stories, life lessons, and soooo much more!! Very educational AND entertaining at the same time! This is NOT boring stuff!",1353801600,,378,4.656716417910448
8024420,5,B00029NM18,"Five years after buying this, the first child has moved on to other things, and the second child is wearing out our DVD player endlessly watching this. Kids just love Hi5 and Music Magic is one of the best ones. Being in Australia, the kids do love the original Hi5 more than the new batch, but they love the American Hi5 just as much as the first Australian batch. If you want to keep your 3 - 5 year olds entertained, buy it.",1326412800,,427,4.156626506024097

8024422,5,B00029NM18,"We ordered this when our son was 25mos. old before going on a LOONNGGG Car trip- because we knew he loved the show Hi-5 (which is on at 6am!!!) Our son LOVES THIS DVD! We have had it 1 month now and it's the first thing he asks to watch when he wakes up, and the the first thing he asks to watch when we walk in the door from daycare! He know's all the character's names, and picks which scenes he wants to watch. I love it as well- not only have I not gotten tired of it- but I love how the show is done, and the age range it covers!",1182988800,,534,3.734513274336283
8024423,5,B00029NM18,"Our daughter, all her friends, in Dubai and India love this. Apart from putting up a good show, it also encourages the kids to dance and exercise themselves. Excellent.",1175644800,,168,4.827586206896552
8024424,5,B00029NM18,"My children are already in love with the Hi-5 gang after watching early morning TLC. Adding this DVD to our collection has proven to be beneficial in more than one way. Primarily, it is incredibly educational and catches the attention of my 4-year-old, as well as my 6-year-old. Other playmates of my children have given the same feedback...boys and girls, alike! I highly recommend ALL the Hi-5 DVD's!",1170288000,,402,4.926470588235294
8024425,5,B00029NM18,"My daughter was 1 yr. when we bought it, she loved it. She is 20 mo. now and still loves it. We put it in the car dvd player and she watches it where ever we go. She doesn't want to watch the other ones.. she always says hop, hop, hop for me to put it in.  So...I have to say GREAT,GREAT,GREAT entertainment!!!!  It is hard on long trips with babies and this DvD makes it sooo easy.",1152403200,,382,3.8846153846153846
