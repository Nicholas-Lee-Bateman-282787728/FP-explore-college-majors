6588780,5,B00MMPB62M,"Phineas and Ferb: Star Wars is a new Disney DVD compilation of the Disney XD Phineas and Ferb special and five episodes of the Disney Channel animated mega-hit. In P&F: Star Wars, it is the retelling of the classic Star Wars: Episode IV added with a Phineas and Ferb touch. Perry the Platypus(Agent P) infiltrate the Empire and steals a CD-Rom plan for the Death Star and must return to the Rebels to thwart Darth Vader's plans to take over the universe, but he is confronted by Vader's goofy counterpart Darthenshmirtz(Dr. Heinz Doofenshmirtz) and what leads to is a hilarious battle. Also, Tatooine moisture farmers Phineas Flynn and Ferb Fletcher joins the Rebellion with the help of the devil may care space raider Isabella Garcia-Shapiro and cosmic bounty hunter Han Solo, as they help Luke Skywalker rescue Princess Leia Organa from the Stormtroopers, which three of them are Candace Flynn, Baljeet Tjinder and Buford van Stomm. Look for some Star Wars jokes like the Rebellion blames some errors on Jar-Jar Binks. The DVD also has five episodes of P&F like Candace meeting Vanessa Doofenshmirtz for the first time, NHL hockey great Luc Robatille in a cameo as Danville goes hockey crazy, and it's a return to the 2nd Dimension as Candace and the Resistance fight against Charlene Doofenshmirtz and Evil Dr. Doof. The only special features are sneak peeks of Disney favourites like the 101 Dalmatians DVD re-release, Star Wars: The Clone Wars: The Lost Missions and a preview of the new Disney/Star Wars cartoon Star Wars: Rebels. P&F: Star Wars is the first joint production between Disney and Lucasfilm, and it is sure to be a fan favourite with Phineas and Ferb fans and fans of the Star Wars franchise!",1416614400,,1712,4.88659793814433
6588781,4,B00MMPB62M,"Disney and Lucasfilm join forces to bring kiddies and their young-at-heart parents Phineas and Ferb Star Wars. It marks the Mouse Houses first real stab at lampooning and honoring George Lucass space opera since the company bought the Galaxy Far, Far Away. Im not counting Mickey and Donald donning Jedi shrouds and stormtrooper armor at Disneyland.

Phineas and Ferb are joyfully relaxing in the glow of Tatooine's twin suns a couple of summers ago in a galaxy far, far away. The two boys and Agent P are suddenly thrust into the middle of a galactic rebellion when the plans for the Death Star fall into their hands. Can they overcome the forces of evil and Stromtrooper Candace? Will Agent P prevent Darthenshmirtz from using his Force-powered ""Sith-Inator?

Phineas and Ferb Star Wars runs parallel to Episode IV: A New Hope. While Phineas and Ferb are embarking on their adventures, they cross paths with Luke, Leia, Han, and Chewbacca as they race to escape the Death Star and bring the hidden plans of the space station to the Rebels. Its funny to see how their actions inadvertently affect what goes on in the original 1977 movie.

Its also entertaining to see the characters, planets, and starships realized in the animated style of Phineas and Ferb. Other familiar faces from the Star Wars saga turn up as well. Ferb adapts Darth Mauls look when he turns to the Dark Side. Jabba the Hutt and his motley crew of creatures show up as well.

Phineas and Ferb Star Wars includes five bonus episodes of the Disney Channel series. Thats eight additional tales we get as extra features. The entire DVD clocks in at over two hours with the Star Wars portion taking up 45 minutes.

Although its rated G, Phineas and Ferb Star Wars does contain some jokes only parents will get. A couple of them I found unnecessary, but children won't understand them. However, older teens might grasp the double-entendres.

Phineas and Ferb Star Wars is a successful mashup between the two Disney worlds. Im sure well be seeing many more such crossovers very soon. I welcome them all if they're crafted as well as this one.

Phineas and Ferb Star Wars is available now on DVD.",1415836800,5,2161,4.746666666666667
6588782,4,B00MMPB62M,"I like PHINES AND FERB Star Wars more than Family Guy one with the characters touch to 1977 NEW HOPE classic.  I was surprise to read the actor who plays Han Solo isn't Harrison Ford as he sounded so much like him.  Rather than a spoof like Family Guy this does a good job of just adding the Phines and Ferb characters along side  real events of movie.  The extra section include a sequal to ACROSS THE 2ND DIMENTION movie. I really like Vanessa songs in the Star Wars story.

This DVD set is packed with hilarious episodes of one of the best cartoons ever made (and being a child of the 80s, I have watched a LOT of cartoons). The Star Wars crossover episode is brilliant, to say the least. It puts our beloved brothers and their friends in the middle of the SW universe, on a storyline parallel to (and often times intersecting) that of ""A New Hope"". This episode has some seriously funny moments (my favorite being the gag about the time share on Alderaan), and every character gets at least one or two great lines. There are a lot of winks to the more hardcore SW fanbase in there as well, if you know where to look. My two kids (age 2 and 6) laughed almost as much as I did at this episode. I won't go into too much detail about the other episodes as, let's be honest, you really wanted to hear about the SW crossover anyhow. Suffice it to say, the rest of the episodes (mostly various holiday episodes) are just as funny as the main SW ep. Definitely worth owning, as it is infinitely rewatchable, and never loses its initial level of hilarity.",1414972800,13,1213,4.367256637168142

6588810,5,B00MMPB62M,"What makes Phineas & Ferb: Star Wars better than just any F and P collection is one of the best satires of the Star Wars movies. The song In the Empire, alone is worth many re runs. And so it goes most scenes following onto or expanding from very convincing animations of the original movie. A list of my favorite small bits world run almost as long as this too short and yet just right, brilliant family friendly satire. This is perfect for your most beloved SW geek be they young in years or merely young at heart.

For me this one segment more than provides the value for this CD. But Wait! There is more! The addition of 5 more  hour P and F episodes make this a rich vein of entertainment for the family. Your choice to run it back to back or to spread it over several time slots.  To be honest, not all of these episodes held to the higher standards of humor I expect from this series. In no particular order:

The Steampunks episode had great promise and a few good laughs, but could have been better.

The Terrifying Tri-State Trilogy of Terror made for a P and F reply to the Simpsons Treehouse of Terror Halloween specials. This episode took me into a world of Phineas and Ferb for which I was not prepared, but was a lot of fun.

Tales from the Resistance only works if you have seen the earlier episode introducing the brothers and their sister from another dimension.

Doof 101 makes stars of some exploring bugs and characters I hope get some small time in more episodes.

And finally there is For your Ice Only a fairly typical P and F episode meaning funnier than most animations targeted at the kids but not esp the best of the boys.
The P and F folks made a point that Phineas and Ferb: Star Wars is  only a send up  based on Star Wars Episode IV , some of the rest are in desperate need of comeuppance, GO for it Team!",1447200000,,1837,4.237822349570201

6588825,3,B00MMPB62M,"We moved to Europe 3 years ago and my boys and I used to LOVE Phineas and Ferb (seasons 1 and 2).  We have not seen the episodes for a long time (I did buy The Fast and the Phineas, Daze of Summer, and Across the Second Dimension, which we LOVE).  But, these must be season 4 because they just were not as well thought out or as well done as they used to be.  Star Wars was choppy at best and 2 of the other 4 episodes were equally disappointing, both my boys (now ages 12, 15) felt the same way.  I know they cancelled the show and it makes me think that the producer's hearts just were not in to making them any more.  They had fun for a while and took a great deal of pride in the production, but this disc does not reflect that any more.  I am sure they were just tired.

We did enjoy Tales from the Resistance, it was more inline with the more fluid/congruous plot that we remember.  And we did still laugh at parts, but they are not nearly as memorable as older ones that we still play the songs from--S.I.M.P, Backyard Beach, I'm Lidana, E.V.I.L.

I am also a die-hard ""Star Wars"" fan and have watched all the movies except the last one repeatedly, so I had a ball with this spoof of the first movie in the franchise.  All the familiar tropes are here, but they take place in the background of a different adventure showing the stock characters from the animated series in the Star Wars universe.  If you like the TV series and you like the movies, you will probably like this too, unless you regard Star Wars as too important to be spoofed.",1429920000,6,649,4.347107438016529

6588856,3,B00MMPB62M,"Love P&F, love Star Wars parodies, and I thought this would be the coming-together of two great things to make something greater. After watching, I feel that Disney rushed this and that it could have been much better.  Don't get me wrong, there are lots of fun moments in it, when they forget the premise of the story and just have Phineas and Ferb fun with it.

Where the problem comes in: the idea is that Phineas and Ferb are also moisture farmers on Tattooine. They find the Death Star plans (which R2 dropped) and spend the movie running around trying to catch up with the real Star Wars characters to return the plans.  This means that many parts of the show are just cartoon remakes of the original movie. (Ep 4 ANH) Disney makes no effort to parody these segments or make them interesting or funny, and they are as bland as you might expect from a kids' TV-cartoon remake of Star Wars.  Either Disney could not bother to try to do something interesting and fun with these segments, or they were scared to make their valuable new property look silly.  In any case, the film feels to me more like Disney marking their turf on Star Wars than an honest creative work.  Most parodies are made by enthusiastic fans, and the only 'fan moment' in this movie was a 'who shot first' comment, which at this point is about original as a sparkly vampire joke.  I'd like to think that the tractor beam scene was an homage to Hardware Wars (the first great Star Wars parody) but it's probably nothing but coincidence. When the Phineas and Ferb characters occasionally break away from the original story, the show does become much more entertaining.

The other episodes on the disc are quite fun and worth watching the DVD for.  High points include a winter holiday/New Years special, and 'Return to the Second Dimension', a follow up to the Phineas and Ferb movie, which features one of the funniest songs I recall from this series.

I'm not saying 'don't buy it.' I'm just saying that, if it's the Star Wars parody that has you excited, temper your hopes a bit.",1421193600,,2055,4.544715447154472
