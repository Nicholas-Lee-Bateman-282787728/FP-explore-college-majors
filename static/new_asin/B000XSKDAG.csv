8229487,3,B000XSKDAG,"I watched the DVD twice to be sure but I only saw non-B17 4 engine bombers twice - and those may have been Brit bombers.  For the most part this DVD was concerned with low-level strafing/bombing by P-38s, P-47s & P-51s (specifically credited).  Lots & lots of low-level strafing gun cam footage.  My suspicion is that this exact same DVD is available under multiple titles to allow the producer to minimize his production costs.  It isn't a bad DVD, it just isn't about B-24s or Normandy specifically.",1471392000,,501,4.724137931034483
8229488,5,B000XSKDAG,"This DVD is full screen format. One hour long. This is a full hour of footage shot on location in Germany (from the air), Russian Bases, and Normandy Beach. This documentary does NOT include still shots or photographs like some documentaries do, this is a solid hour of live rolling footage.
A lot of the footage of B-24's is footage shot from inside the B-24 planes during bombing missions, showing the bombs hitting their targets. There is quite a bit of footage of B-17's and P-51 Mustangs, as well as other aircraft.
This documentary looks and sounds to be an authentic 1940's documentary, from the background music used to the style of narrative.
This would be an excellent DVD to show in History class. There are a few dead bodies shown at the beginning, but nothing too graphic and these scenes are short.
The last 10-13 minutes is about Normandy Beach, not the days of fighting, but the amazing ""construction"" of Normandy beach that made the invasion possible. This was one of my favorite parts of the documentary, as I'd never seen or heard anything about this extraordinary construction. The construction includes a temporary bridge for cargo trucks over water, to 60 large obsolete ships sunk with dynamite, to create a breakwater.",1328572800,,1242,4.863207547169812
8229489,5,B000XSKDAG,I am a history teacher and it is of great educational help to have this type of product where it narrates more specifics that you can find in your regular school books.  It is a safe buy!!,1194307200,2,188,4.081081081081081
