8426232,5,B004DY1OBI,"Why can we not get Region DVD of this very entertaining TV show?

 I enjoyed every episode. I found it entertaining from beginning to end. If I could change anything I would have made their enemies a little more human.",1379635200,,218,4.425
8426233,5,B004DY1OBI,"Let's be clear from the start: MINORITEAM will not be everyone's ""cup of tea"" in terms of animation style or subject matter.  However, for those of you out there old enough to fondly remember the animated adventures of the various Marvel Comics stars on the MERRY MARVEL MARCHING SOCIETY, and for those of you quick--and socially conscious enough--to appreciate broad-based satire aimed squarely at the serious issue of racial prejudice, MINORITEAM can be an absolutely gut-busting nod to the early days of television super hero animation.

There is little in the way of subtlety in the execution of MINORITEAM.  Each fifteen minute episode has more in common with a double barreled shotgun blast, aimed squarely at your adolescent funny-bone, than any attempt at ""high concept"" humor.  This is inspired idiocy, plain and simple.  Not only does MINORITEAM not apologize for its childish, multiple ""rim shot"" style of comic delivery, the show REVELS in the very same.

I adore the art style of the show.  The character designs, panel lay-outs, cuts, pans, and sound effects are not so much an homage to the late, great Jack ""The King"" Kirby (prominently thanked in the closing credits of each episode).  No, there's nothing so refined or constrained going on here.  MINORITEAM is more like a madcap roller coaster ride through some ""alternate universe"" Kirby subconscious--thoroughly laced with a hefty dose of mescaline and LSD.  I personally believe ""King"" Kirby would've laughed himself silly, watching this bizarre and unbridled warped version of his ""artistic muse"" running amok through a world of 2nd, 3rd, and 4th-rate villains and heroes battling over Mankind's moral attitude toward his ethnically diverse brothers and sisters.

However, let it be stated in no uncertain terms: even the concept of racial harmony is used by the series creators and artists as nothing more than a springboard for laughs.  MINORITEAM is Mad magazine moronic and proud of it.

Now, let's address the animation style.  ""Limited"" hardly begins to accurately describe MINORITEAM's execution.  But for those of us who grew up, racing home after school, to worship the adventures of CAPTAIN AMERICA, SUBMARINER, IRON MAN, and the HULK in their virtual ""moving panels"" style of animation, as presented in THE MERRY MARVEL MARCHING SOCIETY animated adventures, MINORITEAM is a lunatic visit with a long-lost friend.  Personally, I can't get enough and I was utterly bummed when Turner's Cartoon Network let MINORITEAM fold its tents after only a season.

Recently, Cartoon Network's ""Adult Swim"" has begun rerunning MINORITEAM at 1:15 a.m., out here on the West Coast, and I'm as giddy as a grinning idiot again.  I make it a point to stay up and record every episode I can, so that I may introduce my 14-year-old to this original--and utterly insane--bit of creative lunacy.  My son is both hip enough to Marvel's past, and a big enough Jack Kirby fan, that he can appreciate MINORITEAM for its past roots and present creativity.  I've read the previous reviewer's opinion of this show and I can only shake my head in wonder.  Either this poor fellow is too young to recognize MINORITEAM's priceless send-up of the MMMS, or he simply lacks anything even remotely resembling a sense of humor.

Personally, I can only PRAY that MINORITEAM receives a proper American DVD release.  The jokes come so fast and furiously in this little gem, that you NEED a DVD, so that you may back-up and freeze countless frames in order to catch the dozens of in-jokes and outrageous illustrations.

No doubt: there will be those who will hate MINORITEAM.  However, I assure you, there are those of us who LOVE it!  So, as Stan and the Bullpen used to say, ""Make mine MINORITEAM!""",1291334400,9,3742,5.024311183144246
8426234,1,B004DY1OBI,"This show is terrible.
I found this dvd in a trash can, it's brightly coloured fancy cover caught my hobo eyes. Being the cartoon hobo that I am decided to check it out.
When I first picked it up it seemed to emit a sort of cheese like substance from the sides of the box. I'm not sure if this was the intent of the producers of the show or not.
Once I arrived back at my hobo cave I watched it.
The cheap animation was the first thing I noticed but this came as no surprise as adult swim have been known to do that sort of thing but still manage to make it work.
This however was terrible, avoid at all costs.
Seriously just avoid this.
I like a lot of adult swim stuff too but this is by far the worst.
Avoid it like a hobo trap.",1290643200,,731,3.88
