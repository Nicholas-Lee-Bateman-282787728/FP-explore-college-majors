1821874,4,B00007LZ79,"I had trouble getting into the first half. It was very low key. The person I was watching with abandoned it early as too boring. But then, as often happens with Indian movies, the second half changed pace, tone and depth and I started to really care about the characters and got hooked.
The actors are a solid bunch and brought their roles off well. Aamir Khan unfortunately did 'annoying jerk' a bit too well early on and was irritating as a character. Fortunately he later became quite likeable. Saif Ali Khan and Preity Zinta always seems to be good and were here too. Akshaye Khanna is also in it but I wasn't sure about him as sensitive artist. He looked more depressed than sensitive and I've liked other stuff he's done better - but he is still fine.
I did end up liking and downloading 3 songs in the movie - which is not a bad rate for a Bollywood I think.
Apart from this I agree with all the positive comments of a former reviewer titled 'Love at Last'.
It was hard to know what to rate it. The first half I would have given perhaps a 2 but it built to a 4 in the second half so I took the 2nd half as my measure. This is one I will hold onto and revisit.",1228780800,,1166,4.118421052631579

Dil Chahta Hai features the powerhouse Bollywood triumvirate of superstar Aamir Kahn, Akshaye Khanna (""he of the uber-expressive eyebrows,"" as another reviewer notes perfectly) and Saif Ali Khan.  Like many Bollywood releases, this is a long one - almost 3 hours - but the trade-off is worth it. Writer/director Farhan Akhtar uses the time to develop each character in rich, detailed layers, especially Khan's Akash and - to a slightly lesser extent - Khanna's Sid.

You have to stretch your imagination a bit.  The three play themselves as university students (in sort of an extended flashback) despite Khan looking every bit his 35 years (and more) at the time of filming (that hair looks suspiciously jet black) and Khanna's famously receding hairline.  No matter - the trio capture the essence of devil-may-care student attitude, especially Khan's spirited instigator.  There's a couple of Bollywood song-and-dance numbers here, but the focus is mainly on the story.  By the end of the film, you care about all three of these guys, hoping it ends up well for each of them individually and as a group.",1189987200,,1701,6.995283018867925
1821876,4,B00007LZ79,"DIL CHAHTA HAI follows the lives of three recent college graduates and long time friends as their paths diverge and intersect thru a span of two years. Akash (Aamir Khan, excellent in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lagaan-Once-Upon-a-Time-in-India/dp/B00005U124/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lagaan - Once Upon a Time in India</a>) is the callous and cynical one, Sameer (Saif Ali Khan) is in love with being in love, and Siddharth ""Sid"" (Akshaye Khanna, he of the overwrought eyebrows) is the contemplative painter. The film lays out their tangled love lives and how that affects their friendship. For the dismissive Akash and the sensitive Sid, one such romantic affair creates a rift which isn't so easily mended.

DIL CHAHTA HAI mostly centers on the guys and their doings, but Preity Zinta does have a hefty role in the film's second half and is fetching as Shalini, the girl being stifled by a controlling fiance. The other two female love interests - Sonali Kulkarni as the modern-minded Pooja, who doesn't believe in arranged marriages, and Dimple Kapadia as Tara, a troubled older woman who shares Sid's artistic passion - both receive minimal screen time, but they do impact the movie.

The film caters to the metropolitan Hindi youth. For one thing, the polished cinematography strengthens the story's very contemporary mindset. From the opening sequence - a club scene featuring menfolk in leather pants - we are immediately clued in that this film concerns a younger Indian generation cloaked in hipness and modern sensibilites. Apparently, this cool and well-to-do set also tends to listen to Sting and read Steve Martini novels, but whatever. But, as per usual, by the film's conclusion, traditional values are espoused. So, in fact, there's really nothing controversial here, excepting maybe the part where Sid falls in love with the much older and divorced Tara and all the baggage which that implies (ah, but does she reciprocate?). Akash and Sameer's love stories stick to the usual Bollywood conventions, with Akash's tale being the more melodramatic.

Even weighed down by a certain predictability, the mostly engaging performances still propel this film to a four star rating (from me, anyway). Akshaye Khanna is good as Sid, the earnest and most introspective of the trio and saddled with the most improbable of romances, and you feel for him near the end. Saif Ali Khan (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hum-Tum-DVD-2004/dp/B0002T910Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hum Tum DVD 2004</a>&nbsp;&<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Salaam-Namaste/dp/B000I0RV90/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Salaam Namaste</a>) is a riot! He has a natural charm and demonstrates an array of truly comic expressions and masterful one liners. He justifiably walked away with several 2002 Indian film awards for his role as Sameer. Sameer is my favorite character in this movie and delivers my favorite line in this film (""I don't think she was from Switzerland, either.""). Aamir Khan's Akash is the main lead character, but I never quite warmed up to him. Akash, as portrayed by Khan, is a smirky, prank-playing jerk who I found extremely unlikable, and, really, it took him way too long to see the light. There was a frustrating scene, after the opera, as he has a conversation with Shalini (Preity) outside her home, where I just wanted to sock him. So, by the time he did come around, he'd built up too much animosity in me to care.

The perpetually peppy Preity Zinta isn't as peppy here, but she still turns in a good, nuanced performance. Dimple Kapadia stands out in her brief stints on screen, and one could see why Sid might be attracted to her, despite their disparity in age. Sonali Kulkarni doesn't get enough screen time to be as relevant, but, as I've mentioned, she does leave an impact, especially in one musical sequence.

Speaking of the songs, there are only two worth mentioning here. The sunny and quite joyous ""Woh Ladki Hai Kahan"" (Where Is That Girl?) just shot up my personal music chart as one of my favorite Bollywood songs. This number befits Sameer's lighthearted story arc and is also a good natured, rib-tickling send-up of old Bollywood (love all that arm flapping). To contrast that catchy tune, there's the bitter strains of ""Tanhayee"" to bring you down, playing as Akash forlornly haunts the streets of Sydney.

At three hours long, this film is an ode to the bonds of friendship, with romance mostly playing second fiddle. As each friend is beset by a dilemma, one or both of the other two inevitably, steadfastly shows up for support. Even with the estranged Sid and Akash, it is never too late to rebuild bridges (it just may take longer). Again, the story offers nothing new, but the stars are compelling and diverting, and it's worth it to sit back and chill (yup, even for three hours) and be regaled by them. Oh, and did I mention how funny Saif Ali Khan is? Or how fun the song ""Woh Ladki Hai Kahan"" is? I did? Well, then, my job is done.",1182038400,2,5088,5.229166666666667

I then played the song videos and it stuck on the third song and no matter how many times I removed the DVD and restarted, it would not budge beyond the third song.

1821921,5,B00007LZ79,"This was a huge hit in India, seen as an important step towards hipper,
less clich Bollywood film-making, that combined the strength of
western films (more low key and subtle story and acting, slicker
technical values) with the Indian use of musical numbers, big themes

The story is about 3 young men graduating from university, their
friendship, and how each deals with love and women.

There are things I could criticize. That 3 hour running time for one thing may
be hard on a US audience (just a cultural difference - that's a common
length in India). Casting actors who are clearly in their mid-30s to play
kids just graduating from college. A score that sounds like a Giorgio Moroder
cast off from the 1980s, and 'happy' montages that look like something Richard
Lester would have done in the early 1960s.

So why did I like it so much? Maybe it just caught me at the
right moment... it's just pretty damn infectious; the
few musical numbers feel slyly integrated (fantasies, performing in a
night club) and cleverly staged, instead of just stuck on. The songs
are good, with catchy melodies and clever wordplay. While the actors
are too old they're charming and natural in their roles. A lot of
clever, funny lines manage to translate across cultures, and while the
dramatic side could be attacked as hackneyed, and a more than a little
paternalistic, I still found myself caught up. Maybe on re-seeing it
I'll downgrade it. But the bottom line was, I had a fun, involved 3
hours I was glad to spend with this film. I smiled a lot. I cared about
what happened and how things turned out, and I was charmed, not turned
off by the seeming anachronisms.

released by 'Spark' (the one pictured with the red cover), which looked decent, and was
a dual level disc. But when I ordered it, I got a knock off single layered
disc by a different company that has a much weaker image. I then

1821925,5,B00007LZ79,"It's a classic coming-of-age story: three old friends, fresh out of college, are standing on the brink of manhood and struggling to take the leap of faith that love requires.

Akash (Aamir Khan), Sameer (Saif Ali Khan), and Sid (Akshaye Khanna) are upper-middle-class urbanites in Mumbai, with cushy lives and promising futures, but they're reluctant to trade the fun of youth for the seriousness of adulthood. Their transition into the work world couldn't be easier--Sameer is going to work for his father's computer business, Akash is being sent to Australia to run his father's company office in Sydney, and Sid is a talented painter who has the support of his family. What scares these young men is the emotional risk that comes with that central rite of passage--falling in love and making a commitment to one person--and the three of them grapple with their fears in completely different ways.

Sameer is a serial monogamist who's too insecure to ever be alone. He gives himself too quickly and too completely without considering whether the women are actually right for him, and when he inevitably discovers they're not, he's heartbroken. First, it's his bossy, humorless college girlfriend, who forces him to choose between her and Akash, whom she thinks is an idiot, and Sameer picks Akash. Next, he takes up with a hippy tourist from the West (their ilk are frequently derided in Indian films), but her interest turns out to be a ruse to rob him. Finally, his parents suggest an arranged marriage and ask him to meet their friend's daughter. At first, he balks, but he ends up liking her. However, she has a boyfriend and doesn't believe in arranged marriage, and for the first time in his life, Sameer has found a woman worth fighting for. (Saif's engaging portrayal helped push his career into the big leagues.)

Akash is the polar opposite of Sameer--he casually picks up girls and doesn't believe in love. If Akash had his way, he and Sameer and Sid would remain best buddies forever, with no interference from women. His stubborn refusal to grow up makes him act like a jerk--until a pretty girl he fancies, Shalini (Preity Zinta), puts him in his place.

Sid is the most mature of the three and his story is the most interesting. He meets a beautiful interior designer named Tara (Dimple Kapadia, who came out of retirement to play the role)--a divorce who's 15 years older than him--and they strike up a friendship over their shared love of art. She appreciates and understands him in a way no one else does, and her belief in his work makes a man out of him. Tara is not some hot-to-trot cougar desperately trying to recapture her long-lost youth, and when Sid falls in love with her, she discourages him. She's an alcoholic, drowning in pain over the loss of custody of her daughter, and she believes Sid deserves better. But he embraces their impractical love nonetheless and gives his heart to her without reservation.

Sid is insulted when Akash insinuates that he's only involved with Tara for sex with an experienced woman, and the resulting rift threatens the friendships that Akash cherishes so dearly. It's a simple, touching story about tender youth, with moving performances from start to finish.

1821927,1,B00007LZ79,My review is not about the movie...The movie is great! but the Amazon service is terrible!!!!! I never received my movie but they obviously charged me the money and I can't even find a phone number or customer service department for Amazon so I can call and fix my problem. I will never buy anything from Amazon again.,1250467200,,318,4.5

1821929,5,B00007LZ79,One of my favorite Indian movies of all time!! It's a little different since it's more about friendship rather than love (for the most part). And Amir Khan looks great in it! =),1235865600,,177,4.393939393939394
7978234,5,B00007LZ79,"I only watched this movie for Aamir Khan. Although, I couldn't care for their clothing. The dressmen needed more training (see credits). Chunky lemon is a good song. Tanhayee describes my life L0L.",1520035200,,197,5.0

7978237,1,B00007LZ79,I bought this movie because it specifically said with English subtitles but there were no subtitles and the quality of the DVD was horrible.,1488326400,,140,4.875

7978239,5,B00007LZ79,"One of my favorite movies of all time. It is funny, drama-filled and captivating. It might be 3 hours long but its a good watch. It is different to most Indian movies and it really set a mark on Indian cinema. The subtitles are on point and the quality is great. Definitely worth a watch.",1473552000,,288,4.254545454545455
7978240,3,B00007LZ79,This is a cute film. The Bollywood scenes are a little much but the rest of the story is very sweet and very entertaining.,1460246400,,122,4.125
7978241,4,B00007LZ79,"I am a fan of Aamir Khan, I admit it.  I love his acting, his directing, and his ""making of"" segments.
This movie didn't thrill me, because it is a often-rehashed plot of 3 guys looking for romance, or at least, finding romance.  Although the acting was fine, Sid and Sameer weren't especially interesting and I yawned through much of the movie.  Even Akash was annoying--until he wasn't.  He enchanted and moved me and made me want to watch again and again.  Sorry--I'm a fan.  Can't help it.",1459036800,,493,4.545454545454546
7978242,3,B00007LZ79,"I am a huge fan of Aamir Khan, but during most of this movie, I did not care for the character Akash that Aamir played, at least until the very end of the movie. So, from my perspective, being able to love Aamir Khan is the main reason I watch Bollywood movies. In Dil Chata Hai, what I liked most was the love story between Sid (Akshaye Khanna) and Tara (Dimple Kapadia).  I also thought Sameer (Saif Ali Khan) was adorable as he fell in love with all the wrong girls for all the wrong reasons. The end of this movie had a bit of a surprise twist that I hadn't encountered in my admittedly  brief tour of Bollywood, This plot twist comes from my American perspective anyway; perhaps it is not a twist for those more familiar with Indian culture. In sum, I like Dil Chahta Hai, but with the exception of Mela (which I didn't like), it is actually my least favorite of all Aamir's work since about 1995.",1458604800,,902,4.269005847953216
