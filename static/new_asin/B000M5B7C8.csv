8531231,1,B000M5B7C8,I had high hopes for this DVD.  I thought that the format would be easy for me to watch as I did other things.  I bought the one for mandarin and unfortunately none of the script marks which tone to use in pronouncing the words.  And in trying to speak Mandarin using the right tone is PART OF the word.  It is impossible to learn to say the word without saying the right tone.  Another thing that I really hate is the speed with which they talk on the tape.  When they are speaking IN ENGLISH they slow down to an infuriating speed as if English was our second language.  I can see absolutely no reason for this except to be annoying.  I wish I could have my money back.  This product stinks!,1221436800,3,693,4.150375939849624
