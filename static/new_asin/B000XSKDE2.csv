8229412,3,B000XSKDE2,"So-so documentary on Australian wildlife. It tries to cram in too much in 53 minutes, with poor background music and a badly written script. For example, a wombat is said to dig a burrow ""longer than a very long truck."" Why not just give the length in meters or feet? What is a ""very long truck""?  Many species are shown fleetingly, but there is good footage of black swans, the lyre bird and dingoes.",1503792000,,401,4.418918918918919
