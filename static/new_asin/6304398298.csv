4435578,5,6304398298,Great Aussie film. Why this has never been released on DVD I'll never know. Co-stars a young Rebekah Elmaloglou (Sophie from Home & Away Aussie TV series).,1305590400,,155,4.777777777777778
4435579,5,6304398298,"A stunning movie set in the outback, a heart warming story of Guilt and tenderness with mystical twists and a beautiful background
Back of Beyond, bosts some outstanding performances, most notable, Dee Smart, and Rebekah Elmaloglou, who gives her finest performance yet as an adult actress.
A must see film if ever there was one.",976665600,7,329,5.0
4435580,4,6304398298,"Back of Beyond is an Australian film about a socially inept mechanic named Tom living out in the desert. When he meets up with a group of thugs (jewel thieves), things start to turn nasty - particularly when the leader's  girlfriend takes a liking to Tom . Superbly acted and the desert proves to  be a chilling setting. Australia should really make more films like this.  Rates 4/5 because of the peculiarity of it all, as well as some of the plot  holes. Dee Smart and Paul Mercurio were great! Also, Amy Miller-Porter who  plays Rosie was a childhood friend of mine and I believe was one of the  best actors. Check it out.",961891200,10,625,4.43859649122807

4435622,3,6304398298,"There's a few gigantic plot holes, but once the story gets going it is somewhat enjoyable and even though the protagonist is a man of very few words, somehow we feel for him and his ""situation"".  The plot takes some cliche, expected, and predictable twists and turns until the very end.  There are a few flashback scenes that get repeated a little too much and some of the acting and writing is a bit suspect...such as the proper way to hold a firearm, and being able to repair a Jaguar in the middle of nowhere without any parts.  A cute movie overall, worth a weeknight view.",1418860800,,577,4.4245283018867925

4435625,3,6304398298,"I have to honestly say that an hour into this movie and I still don't know what the heck it is about.  The acting is good.  I like the scenery.  I keep waiting for the plot to reveal itself.  I know someone died.  I know the mechanic is the one who lost his girlfriend or sister.  Could be both for all I know.  I know some people are broken down.  I don't know how the mechanic walked to the broken down vehicle and then walked back before the car he fixed managed to drive to the same location.  I am not necessarily confused as I am feeling more left out of the loop.  I don't know what the grandfather and his grandkids have to do with anything in this film.  Well, at the very end we find that the mechanic is actually dead.  I don't know if this is a spoiler since who can follow what the rest of the movie is about.  This film seems like a series of unconnected plot lines thrown together to make a strange and unusual piece of cinema.  Not bad.  Not good.  Just somewhere in between.",1417392000,2,991,4.083333333333333

8436499,5,6304398298,"I think if one understood something about aboriginal culture (the land) you might  understand the context of what is going on.  Perhaps the site, the restaurant, the watering hole, the rock outcrop, the three spinning dust devils around the meeting place are where the spirits enter and exit the two worlds.....  A suffering spirit offers those in the living world each their destiny while resolving his guilt.  The plot lays between the two worlds.  The suffering is sensed by the lead character - who is tethered to the restaurant.  Each of the living make a choice that changes the way they already know -- everyone is stuck and they become unstuck in the end.  Well done and interesting. Subtle - lots of nuances.",1479427200,,717,4.780487804878049
