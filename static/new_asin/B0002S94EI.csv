2117021,5,B0002S94EI,"Tagline : Some secrets can't stayed buried!

Synopsis : Here is a tale of a young woman, Laura Kove, who struggles after being subjected to some frightening occurances on Halloween night. A year later she she has been closed off from the outside world, having only her freind Nikki to help her out. When things start to get uneasy again, she seeks the help of Elizabeth Dean who happens to run a ghost watcher's website. Together they will uncover the truth, the truth that haunts Laura.

Overview :

*Atmosphere A wonderful setup with the beginning of the film, to give us a feel of what it must be like for Laura to be so paranoid she can't leave her apartment. We are in her shoes yet the reason WHY she is this way isn't shoved down our throats.....it's a gradual discovery.

*Story Smooth storytelling, writing, and execution. A genuine ghost story with some modern twists.

*Cast/Characters Some truly talented actors in this film. No overdramtic scenes or poor stage direction. Keep your eyes peeled on this cast to appear in more films down the lines. The characters had depth, they were individuals and showed all different aspects of people you may know.

*Pace The movie was over before you knew it and has you craving for more! Good transistions between acts to bring you to the finale where everything falls together nicely.

*F/X Amazing effects team on this film because the there were moments that were just so eerie and even one scene made me cringe so bad my tummy flipped!!

*Cinematography Filmed in and around the Maryland area, you felt like you were right there. Even job well done in the limited space of the apartment that Laura never leaves.

Jekyll's Rating : It was a true pleasure to be able to watch this film and also meet the guys in charge of it. Very talented individuals and I look forward to checking out what they have in store for us next. This one gets a strong 5 star rating from me",1093305600,17,1922,4.580174927113703
2117058,1,B0002S94EI,"This probably looked really good on paper. An agoraphobic girl finds out that she's living in a haunted house. I guess that's one way of solving the age-old question for haunted house movies, ""Why don't they just leave?"" The problem is that the protagonist is completely unengaging. I don't know any agoraphobics. Well, I guess I wouldn't, would I? But it does make it pretty difficult to relate to your main character when she's kinda crazy to begin with. That, on top of the poor video quality and the fact that it quickly turns into a run of the mill haunted house story make it a misfire. It just goes to show you, and interesting tagline doesn't necessarily make an interesting movie.",1119571200,,689,4.655737704918033
2117059,2,B0002S94EI,"I've said it before about low-budget horror films: they can be great if done correctly, so it was easy for me to look past the sub-par acting, picture quality and sound of Ghost Watcher.

  That said, this film was one of the worst low-budget, independent horror movies that I have seen in a long time.  While, I credit it with at least having a story that carries it along, the story telling is not executed particularly well, and it winds up feeling like a very basic, boring ghost story.  There are no scares in the film, and while the composed music was actually very fitting, the heavy metal songs that plagued the rest of the film were awful and had no place in this film.

  What can be said about this film though, was that, while the directing was generally pretty bland, there were some particularly impressive shots, especially during the scene in the barn.  I watched that scene with commentary because I was curious as to what the filmmakers had to say about those shots, and found the commentary to be pretty enjoyable, though not enough that I would sit through this movie a second time.

  Also, and I feel this needs mentioning: this movie features the most blatant Evil Dead reference ever put to film.  It has nothing to do with what is happening on screen, and is an incredibly shameless attempt at an homage.  Not to mention, that Evil Dead is one of the best independent horror films of all time, and this one is very weak.

  And again, I give the filmmakers huge credit for making such a low-budget film, but I just think it could have been done better.

  Also, one more gripe, though not necessarily about the film itself, but about the DVD.  For some reason, the scene selection menu is actually within the special features menu, which may not be a big deal, but seems annoying if you plan on watching this movie more than once, since it could have been easily fixed.  A separate scene selection menu seems standard on all DVDs these days.",1119398400,,1966,4.525568181818182
2117060,1,B0002S94EI,"I wasted two hours of my life watching this drivel,hoping to find a shred of likeability,but it never happened. The ""acting"" is atrocious. Seriously. This would be a great ""mistie'd"" movie because there are so many things to make fun of. I'm sure the young actors gave it their collective best,but the entire undertaking sucked from the beginning.",1117843200,,347,5.0
2117061,4,B0002S94EI,"This is a great first effort film.  While most horror movies are gross bloodfests, this film does not need to sink to such levels.  I was scared throughout the movie, so Mr. Cross, your goal was achieved!  I'm amazed at the nitpicking of some reviews.  Yes, the film is low budget, but it delivers the scare.  Many big budget Hollywood films (The Grudge) can't do that.  Perhaps some people are too desensitized by big budget Hollywood to appreciate a change.  I especially enjoyed Jack, played by Kevin Floyd.  This, like the majority of the cast, is his only film, but I hope to see more of him in the future.",1117584000,,611,4.490909090909091
2117062,3,B0002S94EI,"This movie lacks the budget that you need for a big time scary hit, but that doesn't stop it from being a really good horror film. It deals with a young girl who is afraid to go outside and leave her apartment, because she was stalked by a man 1 year ago. The man also killed her parents and brother. She fears that her apartment may have a ghost in it! So she finds a girl on the net that specializes in ghost hunting. I don't want to tell you any more than that. There are some twists to the story as well. If you like horror movies dealing with ghosts, you should enjoy this movie!",1116374400,,584,4.043103448275862
2117063,2,B0002S94EI,"Let me say, there are some definately scary moments in this film, especially if you're watching it at night.  During the day, though, it might just be funny as you notice all the plot holes.

I think David Cross is a decent director, and this movie definately has potential.  However, he needs to find someone else to do the writing and acting.  The acting in the movie reminded me of high school drama class.  The plot has so many nonsensical parts, as I'll explain here.

Laura thinks her apartment is haunted, so she starts searching on the internet for info about ghosts.  She comes upon this ""ghost watcher"" site, which the premise is supposedly the owner has cameras all over her house so you can report any suspicious activity.  She finds this is just a front for a camwhore who is selling men access to the cameras in her house.  But for some bizarre reason, Laura decides to contact her anyway for help with her ghost problem, knowing that the site is really just a clever porn site.  Then Laura's friend begs the camwhore to help her with her ghost problem, despite the fact that both Laura and her friend know why she has a ghost problem and a internet porn star isn't really going to help with that issue. But it gives Cross the opportunity to put an idiotic and completely out of place scene of the camwhore stripping for the camera.

Anyway, the camwhore comes up with the ""brilliant"" idea that somehow digging up the corpse of the ghost who's haunting Laura and ""making sure he's really dead"" will solve her problem.  I'm sure you can imagine how well THAT plan goes.  And although I don't want to give it away, the ending is lame and doesn't make sense given events that happened earlier in the movie.

One thing you can say for Cross is he knows how to scare an audience, without any fancy special effects or equipment.  Now, if only he can find someone to write a horror script that makes sense, that'd be a movie I'd want to see.",1115769600,,1948,4.463276836158192
2117064,1,B0002S94EI,"I cannot believe that I wasted 3.99 renting this movie. This is the perfect example of judging a book by its cover. It put me in the mind of one of those low budget porno's with their acting technique. It made me think of them learning their lines right before the part. It was really horrible. I am so angry I wasted my money, the hour and a half watching it, (which I felt like doing dishes in the middle of it), and wasting my eyes, and ears on such crap. My eyes are still bleeding from watching this HORRIBLE movie. I feel like asking for a refund. DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS MOVIE~!!!!!",1111536000,,595,4.182608695652174
2117065,2,B0002S94EI,"I'm going way out on a limb here and giving the movie two stars because it started out differently and had some eerie moments.  However, it isn't long before it descends into movie madness, with so many inconsistencies and plot holes that it could pass as Swiss cheese.  Jillian Byrnes who ""plays"" Laura, our supposed heroine looks like a refugee from a rehab program, who develops agoraphobia after her parents are killed in a car accident and after this mysterious stalker takes her out to a barn and cuts her face up a little bit.  She thinks she's ""safe"" in her apartment, although we later find out a secret she and her friend Nikki share that would negate her safety.  Pretty lame writing.  Marianne Hayden who plays Nikki has the emotional range of a pomegranate.  Then enter Jennifer Servary who plays Elizabeth, the ""ghostwatcher"" who also does porn stuff on her web site, evidently to supplement her income.  She gets involved in trying to piece together the puzzle's complex parts.  Servary is the only one who comes close to having any acting chops, and notice I said close.  The best thing about the DVD is the gagwatcher goofs.  Director/writer David cross obviously had fun making this fluff, and there is one particularly funny segment in which flatulence is integrated in a scene a'la' Mystery 3000 Theatre or whatever.  This is a dog, but it's a poodle and not a rottweiler.",1110499200,,1392,4.758333333333334
2117066,4,B0002S94EI,"I enjoyed this movie.  Yes, it's obvious these are amateurs and it is a first effort, but the premise is interesting and it is genuinely spooky in several parts.  It is a very interesting ghost story and well worth a look.",1110412800,,222,4.390243902439025
2117067,1,B0002S94EI,"It would be very time consuming to get into all the reasons why I wish I hadn't bought, let alone, watched this DVD.  Everything that you could possibly attribute to a bad movie was present....bad plot, horrible acting, pathetic character developement.  For me, this movie was right on par with ""The Blair Witch Project"".  If you have absolutely nothing else in life to do for about 90 minutes, find something other than this movie to occupy that void.  And, if you don't feel like taking my warning....feel free to buy my copy.",1110067200,2,528,4.706521739130435
2117088,1,B0002S94EI,"This was probably the worst movie I've seen in a long time. For one: The Scene where she put the camera on the computer to record what happened in the middle of the night and then watched it back. How in the world could the camera have been zooming in and out and panning from left to right? Stupid mistake. Next, the actors were absolutely horrible, my dog who is mentally retarded and cat with 3 legs could have done way better than the actors in this movie. I would also like to know why the ghost was called two different names, first Dixon and then some other name at the end, that didn't make any sense to me. The ending was horrible. Actually the whole thing was horrible, a huge waste of time don't even think about renting, buying, or even borrowing this movie from a friend unless you have plans to use it as some sort of flying object to hit an elderly friend with.",1105747200,2,876,4.251497005988024
2117089,1,B0002S94EI,"Do not waste your money on this piece of junk! Anybody who rates it above one star is obviously from the production team.

I just can't say enough bad things about it so I'll just sum it up with one word: LAME!",1105056000,3,288,4.351851851851852
2117090,3,B0002S94EI,"Even though he made it, he's right, it's about 3 stars.  Put it basically, it has original plot and some really creepy parts.  But it was held back by its low budget, no doubt about it.  So if you need the giant effects, steer clear.  But if your a big time horror fan, don't miss it.",1104796800,,284,4.017857142857143
2117091,3,B0002S94EI,"Yes, it is low budget, VERY low budget, but I have to admit this movie was quite original. At first I thought this was going to be bad, due to a slow start, but I was pleasantly surprised. The story eventually moves along well, and there are a few twists and turns along the way. I was surprised to find myself rather engrossed in this movie. It was also an added plus to recognize some of the landmarks in the movie, having grown up in the general area. I recommend this original and entertaining movie, as long as you go in knowing its low budget.",1103068800,2,549,4.238095238095238
2117092,3,B0002S94EI,"I have seen every horror movie ever filmed (well, most).  Low budget and high; this film had a great plot, some pretty surprizing acting, and if a a bit more money had been spent, it would have been rated up there with Evil Dead.  It made me jump a few times, especially the basement scene.  The reason I only gave 3 stars was because of tacky filming.  At first I thought it was a student film because of the amateurish work, but the plot and acting made it well worth the time to watch.",1102982400,2,488,4.159574468085107
2117093,1,B0002S94EI,"I was seriously expecting this movie to challenge Orange County, Men in Black II, and Goldmember as the best comedy picture of 2002.  I was so impressed, in fact, that I did background research on the main characters.  To my surprise, I found that none of them have been in any movies besides this one.  I couldn't understand why, when all of a sudden I thought to myself, ""ooooh yeah, they sucked ass!""  The blonde chick spends half the movie running away from a ghost who doesnt even threaten her.  One time, he just looks her in the eye and touches her arm like a gentleman, and she gets all riled up.  The ghost is the most famous character in the movie, becuz he was the same blue dude in the Dell PC commercials, where he looked just as goofy.  I heard a rumor that he's gonna be in the upcoming Smurfs movie as well.  At least he has somewhat of a future.",1102723200,,862,4.245398773006135
2117094,3,B0002S94EI,"I have been so sick of Hollywood Horror for quite some time; it is insulting to intelligence.

This film, although low budget, seemed well thought out.  I was especially pleased by the story, which was original, unpredictable, and unfolded at a nice pace.  There were moments that made me jump, but even though I was looking for a scary movie when I got this, the scare turned out not to be the most important part.  I wanted to know what happened next, the scares were complimentary.

The acting quality did get better as the story deepened, however, I have seen higher budget films with acting far worse.  The girls were quite believable, especially during a few shining moments.

The actual film quality wasn't as bad as I had read on some reviews.  It seemed to be the standard low budget film quality.  Almost the same eerie quality as . . . yes . . . Evil Dead, (Great reference, by the way).

I think with a larger budget, this film would have been phenomenal; whatever flaws found seem mostly due to the smaller budget and unrefined natural artistic abilities.

This is one film worth giving a chance.",1101600000,6,1109,4.5786802030456855
2117095,5,B0002S94EI,"This has got to be one of the best scary movies of all time.  It's a supernatural twist on a serial killer plot.  But, it's totally original...a welcome change from the usual horror flick cliches.  You can't guess the direction that this film will take untill the end, because the script is different from any of the ""typical"" horror flicks.  I thought this movie was absolutely terrifying.  The low budget style and unknown actors made it seem more real.  The characters have depth, also different from many movies in this genre.  But, the movie doesn't overburden the viewer with all the characters' personal problems, either. I defy anyone to watch this and not be on the edge-of-your-seat during the ""barn scene"", or the scene in the basement of the old house.  I had to press pause repeatedly during these scenes because I just couldn't take the suspense.  If you're looking for a genuinely frightening, original suspensful movie, this is for you.  However, if you prefer played-out, predictable slasher flicks (like many people do) you might want to skip this one.  This is more frightening and more original than The Ring.  This will become a classic independent film.  Very fun to watch if you like scary movies.",1101600000,7,1220,4.864077669902913
2117096,4,B0002S94EI,"I rented this movie a couple of weeks ago and I am still compelled to write a review. The plot creates a few 'huh' moments -but relatively minimal unlike many huge block busters that cost millions.

The story kept you involved and you cared about the characters ( not a slasher film), you get the idea that the main character is a shut-in and for good reason.  There are some legimatly scarey moments that made me jump.  The makers didn't go overboard with cheesy special effects either I liked the simplicity.  It was an A+  low budget flick",1100736000,2,542,4.489795918367347
2117097,3,B0002S94EI,"I have to admit that my expectations weren't high when I rented this movie, but I found it to be an entertaining film. While you can tell it didn't have the typical Hollywood ""Spit shine polished"" look to it, it did have an over all creepiness that made up for the flash and glitz. Then again what do I know, cause I believe ""Tourist Trap"" is one of the all-time great horror movies.",1100649600,3,383,4.260273972602739
2117108,3,B0002S94EI,"I'm a fan of low-budget direct-to-video horror films. Most of the time, the films are entertaining but down right bad.

I felt ""Ghost Watcher"" is a definite cut above the rest of these films. The film contains some genuinely creepy moments (especially the scenes in the old house). I give the film 3 out of 5 stars.",1100649600,3,315,4.526315789473684
2117109,2,B0002S94EI,"For anyone considering viewing this movie, buying it, or renting it, just one thing you should know... this is the equivalent of college film making, perhaps it actually is!  This is not even B-Budget.  However, once you get passed this and get used to the 'quality' of the acting and directing, it does improve.  The worst elements are simply wooden 'first-flick-ever' acting, terribly corny and badly placed music, and a script that is not really complimented by the directing.  Actually, very little benefits from the directing.  In some places I'm not sure what could actually be done considering the plot seems to confuse the director when you listen to the extras.

Seriously, there are parts in the movie plot that just left me and my wife wondering what the heck just happened.  Although we think we pieced it together, the explanation for some of the later scenes still seems both out of leftfield and lacking any kind of rationality.

My wife wanted to rent this one because of the word 'ghost' in the title, and I gave in and watched it with her, with low expectations.  The only thing that really redeemed this movie for me were some of the outtakes in the extras menu.  While there were no real scares in the film for me (mostly due to ineffective directing of the scenes and cheesey awful music) one part did give my wife a quick fright, while I was just rolling my eyes.  The acting, especially early on is wooden and the main character, is given nothing to make her likeable to the viewer.  The Ghost Hunter chick is the best thing about the movie and she sidelines the haunted chick for most of the film.  But still, the acting may only have seemed to have improved because I quickly adjusted to the fact that this was not the hollywood movie I had assumed it was going to be.  Not even Hollywood... Looks like it was shot in Maryland, or somewhere on the East Coast by a group of friends.

My wife's comments were simply ""it's a shame it wasn't better.""

Despite all this, I would actually recommend this film to anyone interested in making films, be they student films, small independent films, film shorts, or anything of that nature.  However, there is no way this movie deserves anything higher than 2 stars.  The only reason I didn't give it just one star was that I felt kind of sympathetic towards the novice production team.  The director talks about hopes for a sequel.  Well, I wish this movie the best of luck.  It looks like those involved had a lot of fun making it.",1100304000,,2497,4.5662921348314605

I came back the next night and paid for it. Got to see two great films in two days.  Ghost Watcher had that rare feel to it that if it doesn't scare you it at least gives you the creeps.  It's not about the special effects people, get it through yer heads.  The image of something crawling at you with mean-ugly eyes, quick lightning flash and the freak is next to you is a good scare that I think anyone would share.  The developments towards the end gave it a maturation and a promise, and do I need to mention the copious blood vomit scene.  Good stuff and can't wait to see his next.

Ghost Watcher contains elements that might remind you of The Blair Witch Project, Evil Dead, or even the low-budget classic Carnival of Souls, but the film left me less satisfied than any of those three. Much effort went into building suspense and atmosphere, but for me it made promises it couldn't keep, with an ending that was a bit of a dissapointment.",1099612800,4,512,4.637362637362638

The movie basically picks up a year later when an apparition disrupts her shut in lifestyle but since she is incapable of fleeing she decides via the web to bring in a ghost hunter.
Much to my suprise the plot thickens and varies as the entire story unfolds.
I had very low expectations when I rented this and even once the film started because of the quality of the shot on all digital look and the luke warm acting I thought oh man another direct to vid craptacular horror flick.
I am not a fan of shoddy looking low budget horror movies that are flooding the market right now but this little flick has a ton of heart and loads of ambition that outshine its flaws by leaps and bounds.
The end result is pretty routine but overall the movie works.
Let us horror and film fans once again thank Lions Gate films for bringing yet another fine piece that would have been otherwise buried or lost entirely.

Ghostwatcher is a genuinely creepy movie that actually earns it's scares.

The low budget works! It is creepy in the way that the Blair Witch Project and Paranormal Activity are.  Horror films are the one genre where less money can actually be a positive.

There are about three or four really creepy scenes in here, and the ending is a blast, and not expected at all.

Boy,when it came to the first really scary scene I almost jumped outta my seat screaming!!I definately have to give it a high rating and tell everyone that they WILL NOT be disappointed if they take the time to watch this movie. As a matter of fact,no sooner than I had watched it,I was calling around to all the stores and malls within a 60-70 mile radius from my home in Saltville,VA. trying to find a copy to buy and found myself on Amazon.com buying one. I am an avid collector of movies,mainly horror,and this one was one I just had to have right away. I'd like to add before going that I think that the writer/director of this film,David A.Cross is a very talented and imaginative young man and did a wonderful job with this film and all of the awsome actors/actresses in it! I would love to be in one of his future movies,hopefully a sequel(s) to this killer movie!!GREAT JOB,GUYS!!!I just know theres gonna be a part 2!!!",1158451200,,1330,4.477366255144033
8031157,3,B0002S94EI,"For a low budget feature, it has a decent plot and some basic effects.  Nothing superior, but better than your average straight to Sci-Fi Channel flick.  Give it a rent and you won't be disappointed.

A couple of genuinely creepy moments and some funny lines.  A few unintentionally funny moments,  but overall I liked it.  The DVD even has a few secent extras.",1158105600,,361,4.650793650793651
8031158,4,B0002S94EI,"I loved the movie and had a great time watching it.  This movie really made me think about people that are young, single, and live alone.  I cannot wait for the next one to get out.  Plus Jillian is an awesome woman.",1129075200,,216,4.095238095238095
8031159,5,B0002S94EI,"Ok this movie was low low budget, some of the acting wasn't that great, but the plot was really scary.  The one scene where the lights kept flashing on and off with the dead guy was creepy.  I really have to give my all to everyone in this film including the writer and director.  The plot was original and some of the effects pretty neat.  I'm looking forward to seeing more come from this crew.",1127088000,,396,4.24
8031160,3,B0002S94EI,"For an indie horror flick, it at least kept my attention.  If you can ignore the sometimes poor acting, and the limited budget (sometimes with laugh-out-loud cosmetics on the one dead guy - won't give away more than that, but think ""Blue Man Group""), and the cheesy flying papers and books (a-la Postergeist) it really was a slight bit better than your average off-the-shelf (OTS) Blockbuster ""I really am trying to find a good horror diamond in the rough"" pick.  If you want one of those, try ""Session 9"", ""Dead Birds"", or maybe (to lesser degree) ""Ginger Snaps"" - (Ginger Snaps, while not scary, is at least interesting and clever at times). I recommend all those for anyone llooking for a surprise interesting horror movie that won't waste your time.

I give them an A for effort in this (Ghost Watcher), what seems a slightly better than average college postgraduate film effort (though it was apparently produced by a professional film company). I do have to say, there were some moments of individuality in this one that lack so often in the others of this OTS horror genre.

Just by way of background, and while other reviewers seems to prefer to reveal much of the story and plot, I think that sort of ruins the film in many cases.  So, you'll want to look for other reviews and reviewers if that is what you are looking for...",1124841600,2,1335,4.616033755274262
