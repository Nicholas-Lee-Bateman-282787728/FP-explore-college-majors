The story is simple and the mibie is not very long which makes it a very  easy watching experience.  A man dresed as jesus hayecrashes a house party and stsrts to throtle all the peoole in the house.  Seemingly,  random and quite pointless.  As the story unfolds with a few flashbacks, we se there is more to this tale than we first thought and whay folows is an enhaging tale of revenge wirh an anti bullying theme.  I can't say if this was an intentional theme or just what I gleaned from it personally but it was fast paced and enjoyable.  My only complaint is that there was not enough brutality.  Saying that,  it was made for less than the pricee of a night out so it can be forgiven",1368576000,2,849,4.310126582278481

8418923,5,B0049B2W48,"This was a really fun love letter to old school exploitation flicks! It seems like alot of people are going for the ""grindhouse"" feel and don't really quite understand how to do it correctly. This film did a great job feeling like a 70s flick. Not only did the film itself look gritty but you could see the 70s style in the camera shots and colors in this film. Very fun flick! Worth picking up!",1308009600,,395,4.28

Brutal Jesus is a 46min indie Movie that was shot the UK in 2010 for I belive a budget of 10/$15!!!

In a nutshell - It's a Killer Jesus revenge movie
(Christploitation)
The visual worn/grainy Grindhouse style gives it that whole classic exploitation look - Jesus ( Steven Newton) is a threatening/surreal presence who is void of dialogue (but accompanied by industrial soundtrack) - Except for a flashback scene later in the film.

The film is concise and it's a great achievement that it at no time becomes dull -  In fact I loved it!!

And while it may have some short comings - It would be harsh to knock what is in fact a triumph of what can be created by a small group of actors and film makers who enjoy watching movies & are now inspired into making movies - VERY COOL.
