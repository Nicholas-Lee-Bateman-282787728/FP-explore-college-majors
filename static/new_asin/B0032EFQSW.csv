8387460,3,B0032EFQSW,"Over all the movies were what I expected for a 4 movie pack...though I have to say that Hidden Agenda really doesn't seem to be sci-fi at all, it's more of a pseudo thriller. Lifepod was the best of them, with an interesting blend of sci-fi and disaster movie themes woven together with distopian future thrown in. T-Force was utterly ridiculous and downright fully of late 80s early 90s action silliness and plot holes you can drive trucks through. Star Knight was equally silly and often just embarrassing to watch (poor Harvy Keitel trying to do a kind of 50s ideal of a middle-ages knight).",1350345600,2,594,4.666666666666667

8387462,3,B0032EFQSW,"I adore good science fiction.  Give me the reimagined Battlestar Galactica or Farscape and I can literally be content to pull a nonstop marathon.  However, this collection here is, oy where to begin.  I suppose when you stop to consider a collection of 4- full length feature films for under $10 (in fact closer to $5 at your local store's reduced bin) you sort of have to have some seriously low expectations.  Even so I feel like this collection is pretty darn hideous.

In the event that you've never encountered any of the 4 films contained here, I should begin by disclaiming that Lifepod is by far and away the best piece here- arguably worth the price of admission by itself.  While a little light on action, this retelling of the famous ""whodunit"" by Alfred Hitchcock (Lifeboat) in a sci-fi setting works extremely well.  The acting is top notch and the dilemmas feel pretty convincing.

Like most true science fiction, it relies less upon special effects or visual appeal (you listening Michael Bay?) in favor of solid story telling.  Since this set costs about the same as buying Lifepod alone, perhaps its best to consider that you are buying this film and getting three more ""science fiction"" movies as bonus material.

And speaking of those other three, it's difficult to even list them in any sort of order.  They are all less than Grade B titles that you would probably change if you happened upon them on a Tuesday, 2:30am on SyFy.  That said I suppose T-Force may be the best of the trio but it's still pretty painful.

Despite what the cover may want you to believe, the film resembles Delta Force more than it does The Terminator franchise.  What you get here is a bunch of cybernetic ""heroes"" placed in charge of protecting humanity and the endless drama that comes with turning to machines to do our police work.  A few of the props (like the robot hand) seem to have been borrowed from the Terminator's set but what you really get here is a poorly constructed action flick with a little bit of topless female nudity to prevent you from throwing your remote through the screen.

Next would probably be Hidden Agenda.. A film that somehow shares a name with a whole bunch of movies, all of which are better than this one (don't take my word for it, there's one starring Frances McDormand and Brian Cox and another featuring Dolph Lundgren).  This one stars Kevin Dillon and in the event that name means nothing to you, rest assured, you aren't alone.  Matt Dillon you mean? Nope, Kevin.

This one tries to appeal to the mind-job scifi scene, like a sort of low budget ""Dj vu"" and ""The Manchurian Candidate"" with some East German secret police action, some hit men, conspiracies and a lot of mediocrity.  Of the four, this film could in fact be considered the most serious in terms of scope and ideology but a lot of that gets lost in the translation.

Finally, bringing up the rear would have to be Star Knight.. A film that despite IMDB's promises, I could not accept came out in 1984.  1974, maybe. 1964 definitely! You get a venerable train wreck of a picture, with awful acting, lips that don't match up with the words, dialog that could make a Grade B movie fanatic blush and action that, well never mind.  It's very unlikely you'll make it to the action scenes.

All you need to know is that somewhere amidst the goofiness you may actually have had the idea for a halfway decent made-for-tv movie.  A UFO visits and deposits an alien in medieval Europe- Amidst kings, knights, wizards and clerics.  Perhaps acceptable had it been an episode of Stargate SG-1 but what you get here is nothing shy of painful start to finish.  Of course I have to assume that last statement, try as I may, I was quite unable to get to the end of this one.  One thing is for certain: the reason Harvey Keitel has been laying so low lately could very well be that he's busy trying to scratch his name from the DVD case of every copy of this one distributed!",1334880000,6,3961,4.548660084626234
