32521,5,0780021088,"THE NAKED KISS opens with such a shocking, lurid and erotic scene of a prostitute violently beating her pimp, seen blow by blow from his point of view, that the viewer is immediately jolted and gripped by these images and is mesmerized. Director, Samuel Fuller hooks you and he doesn't let go. The statuesque Constance Towers is the prostitute named Kelly and eventually she arrives at a new town where she ultimately decides to start a new life that leads to her working with disabled children. Certain aspects of her past experiences lead her to conclusions that are unspeakable about the ""normal"" society that she has now established herself in. This is truly a remarkable film because director- writer Fuller takes the viewer to avenues of unexpected emotional response both subtle and outlandish touching raw nerves along the way leaving one disconcerted and devastated.  The chiaroscuro cinematography by Stanley Cortez shooting the light and dark elements of Constance Towers face and figure within each frame lends to the off beat and sensational visual expression of this torn figure of a woman. Towers and Cortez both complete Fuller's vision of a hard world speckled with fleeting moments of sentimentality and an ever-elusive sentimentality.",1026086400,10,1253,5.202970297029703
32522,1,0780021088,"This is a review of the older Criterion DVD, not of the more recent and much better Criterion Blu-Ray. This is one of the great, cult, Fuller films. Notable for its trashy blend of noir fatalism, stereotypical American settings and characters, and subversive anti establishment amoralism. However, save yourself $30.00 and buy a used VHS copy of the film, this Criterion edition is an absolutely AWFUL print, and looks to be no better than the cheapest VHS tape in quality.
Criterion continues to push the envelope -- the limit of how much people are willing to pay for what are frequently sub standard prints and transfers of classic films. They have had some wonderful remasters and reissues, and deserve credit for those. But they also won't hesitate to use their name and reputation to hustle poor quality copies.",1024099200,20,817,4.927536231884058
32523,4,0780021088,"This is an important film to me because it made me realize a major difference between truly American directors, and the European expatriates like Hitchcock, Wilder, David Lean, that mainstream Americans remember from this same period. I believe at their core American film directors want to preach; though, ""preach"" is a pejorative word for it. And directors either went at the system head-on -- e.g., Welles and Kubrick -- and were then forced out of the US, or they worked below the radar: and Fuller is the most outspoken American director that tried to stay under the radar (though even he was eventually forced from our land of free speech in order to finance his films -- alas, free speech is anything BUT free, if you want anyone to hear you anyway). I could write a thesis on both of the paradoxes mentioned above, but it would bore you.
I think ""The Naked Kiss"" was meant more as an entertainment than ""Shock Corridor"", but it sure as [heck] ain't a film for average Joe and Jane Q. American where the freedom to say what you mean and mean what you say is edited and re-edited in order to meet a democratic, social, money-paying group. I do think if you have aspirations to make films it's an important film to understand. Fuller's sense of humor, irreverence, and yet heart are quintessentially American. Any American artist (filmmaker, writer, architect, etc.) you've ever heard of usually has these qualities, and there are few other places where they are more naked than in ""The Naked Kiss.""",1020297600,6,1504,4.744274809160306
32524,4,0780021088,"Veteran director Samuel Fuller clearly pushed the envelope with this raw, uncomprising look at the life of a prostitute who wants out.  Although relegated to B-movie second-run status at the time of it's release, this tightly-woven bundle packs a real wallop.  One can see why it was controversial and probably swept under the rug by the distributor - how many movies from the mid-sixties tackled prostitution, abortion, and child molestation, all in the same breath?  Fuller expertly draws solid performances from his cast, especially Constance Towers and Anthony Eisley (of ""Hawaiian Eye"" fame) in the leads. The extras are nice, too - bios of cast and crew, trailer, etc. If you're a fan of hard-boiled film noir, take a chance on this one!",1018828800,2,743,5.024390243902439
32525,4,0780021088,"Beyond the ""exploitation movie"" premise and several admittedly effective ""shock"" scenes, this movie delivers a pretty good story about a prostitute moving to a small town and attempting to live a more traditional life. I liked the way the main character wasn't a typical movie prostitute with a heart of gold, but a tough, hardened woman with a heart of steel. The character's toughness both helps and hinders her as she confronts several bizarre situations in a small town not as wholesome and ""apple pie"" as it first seems. One wonders if this film was an inspiration for David Lynch's ""Blue Velvet"", probably the most famous movie examining the theme of image versus reality in small-town America.

32529,5,0780021088,"Produced, written and directed by Samuel Fuller, THE NAKED KISS is a little jewel. Constance Towers, in a ""  la Gena Rowlands "" role, gives a performance you won't forget easily. A great thanks then to  Criterion which allows us to rediscover this wonderful movie.
Samuel  Fuller, from his 1940 debut in Hollywood until his last movies in France,  deserves to be considered as one of the great american directors of the  last fifty years. He mainly visited the western, war movies and film noir  genres and gave us such masterpieces as FORTY GUNS, SHOCK CORRIDOR and  UNDERWORLD, U.S.A. With no big stars but with a style of its own. Raw,  violent and provocative, for the eyes and also for the intellect.
THE  NAKED KISS is a movie destined to shock the audience. An emotionally  ultra-violent first scene prepares us to a journey through Cinderella Land  and the Garden of Evil. Samuel Fuller won't let anybody unharm. The  Charming Prince, the Hooker with a heart big as the world, the Cop blas :  everybody will suffer in front of Fuller's camera.
It's the third time I  watch THE NAKED KISS, the first time on DVD, and I like it even more now.  Its atmosphere is one of the strangest you can find on film. Remember  Charles Laughton's NIGHT OF THE HUNTER ? One can feel a bit of this dreamy  atmosphere in Fuller's movie. The child song Constance Towers sings with  the handicapped children will give you the chill.
Image is great, a few  white spots now and then coming from a non-perfect copy. The sound is good  but you'll have to turn your volume control. Scene access and theatrical  trailer as bonus features.

32543,4,0780021088,"Samuel Fuller's (1912 1997) gifts as a director of low-budget, sensationalistic, and morally provocative films are on full display in this 1964 movie,  ""The Naked Kiss"", which Fuller also produced and wrote. This black-and- white film features Constance Towers as Kelly, a prostitute seeking to make a new life for herself, Anthony Griff as Captain Griff of the local police force, and Michael Dante, as Grant, the wealthiest resident of the town which bears his name who hopes to marry Kelly.  The American small town of Grantsville also is a prominent character in the film.

In its story of a prostitute, brothels, and pimps, the film has its share of sleaze and violence. In the movie's most memorable scene, Kelly beats her pimp, who has shaven her bald, before she is forced to flee the city and practice her trade in small towns.  When she arrives in Grantsville, Captain Griff purchases her services while advising her to relocate in a popular brothel in a town across the river. Kelly, who loves Beethoven and his Moonlight Sonata, Goethe, and Lord Byron, decides instead to make a new life.  She gives up prostitution to work as a nursing assistant in the town hospital for handicapped children and establishes a remarkable rapport with her patients.

As the story progresses, Kelly attracts the attention of the wealthy and idle Grant.  When the two fall in love, Kelly tells Grant of her life as a prostitute, but Grant continues ardent and proposes. Kelly feels she has found a life. When she finds Grant about to molest a young girl, she kills Grant n a fit of rage. Although Griff is skeptical of her claims and a host of witnesses testify against, Kelly, the true story eventually comes out. In an ambiguous ending, Kelly leaves Grantsville as an independent and free woman.  With her independence and life as a prostitute, Kelly sees life as gaining its meaning from love and from forming a lasting relationship with a man. This is a traditional, moralizing theme at the heart of this film.

The movie includes a great deal of toughness together with caricature, sentimentality, and moralizing.  The little town of Grantville has its virtues but is also a place of sexual repression and, of course, hypocrisy.  Kelly is a practitioner of her trade but also educated with a mind and heart of her own.  She finds, as she tells a young woman who wants to work in the brothel across the river, that prostitution results in a life of contempt for oneself and contempt for men. It results in a loveless, childless life for the woman and in lifelong loneliness. Kelly beats the madam who tries to recruit her friend into the brothel and gives her friend a large sum of money on condition that she will not use it for an abortion  -  which in the morality of this film is viewed as a grave sin.  With the sensationalism of the film's themes and the manner of their presentation, ""The Naked Kiss"" takes seriously what are now considered traditional values.

This noir film thus looks two ways towards the lurid and the sensational and towards the traditional and sentimental. In this respect, it shares many traits with other noir literature and film. Admirers of noir and of Samuel Fuller will enjoy this apparently critical and yet traditionally themed movie.

32550,5,0780021088,"""The Naked Kiss"" is one of the most provocative films you'll ever see.  Its themes are stated bluntly but not too explicitly by director-writer Samuel Fuller.  It's not so much a noir but a pulp fairy tale.  The film concerns a prostitute, Kelly, (Constance Towers) who flees her sadistic procurer and emerges in one of those Rockwellian towns that only exist on the cover of the ""Saturday Evening Post"".  Everything at first goes swimmingly.  The trusting seamstress who rents her a room.  The hospital that hires her without references to administer tough love to the handicapped children.  The darkly handsome philanthropist who loves her despite her past.  The only adversity comes in the form of a beat cop,Griff, (Anthony Eisley) who would prefer she ply her old trade at Candy's brothel across the river.  When it's too good there has to be an underside and is there ever.  Grantville despite its shiny veneer has a dark undercurrent and it's prepared to suck Kelly in with only Griff there to save her.  Not to give away too much away similar themes were explored in Charles Laughton's masterpiece ""The Night of the Hunter"" though these are completely different films though both films are given their black-and-white sheen by ace cinematographer Stanley Cortez.  Fuller tackles any number of social ills in a thoughtful non-exploitational way.  Towers shines as a smart noble woman who's made some bad life choices.  Watch this film and legitimately be prepared to be shocked.",1372377600,3,1485,5.0081632653061225
32561,5,0780021088,"The Naked Kiss is unforgettable ! Really shows you what pulp fiction is on film. Plot-wise the story of a reformed prostitute seems unlikely to entertain.

Other actresses adding interest are Patsy Kelly, Edy Williams, and the ever reliable Virginia Grey. Trashy films can be so bad that they are good.

32563,5,0780021088,"I once asked a fellow film enthusiast to suggest a unique film that he thought I might enjoy. Something I had never seen before but would appreciate. That film was THE NAKED KISS and he was right on the mark. I loved it. I had only seen a couple of Fuller's film before, PICKUP ON SOUTH STREET and THE BIG RED ONE. This film, along with SHOCK CORRIDOR, make all other Fuller films look main stream in comparison. The story is real ""pulp fiction"". It is a wonderful B-film with over the top, way before its time, melodrama with dialogue that seems to be from any campy film noir of the 1940's or 50's. The story is about Kelly, an ex-prostitute who decides to leave her old life behind and start fresh. She ends up in Grantville, a suburb that on the outside looks as clean and wholesome as a piece of Wonderbread but as we know now there are alot of additives and artificial coloring in Wonderbread but in the early 1960s we tried not look at list of ingredients too often. Kelly ends up as a nurse's assistant at the Grantville Orthopedic Medical Center. She has the heart and talent to work with the disabled children there. She also falls for the rich benefactor of the hospital. This film is so instinctual and raw and covers subject matter that was taboo back in 1964 that it is one of the most courageous film ventures I can think of. This film and Fuller's 1963 film SHOCK CORRIDOR make an incredible double-feature for when you want to venture outside the box of conventional film and into the eccentric world that Fuller has created with these two classics.",1351555200,2,1566,4.45993031358885

32566,3,0780021088,"Only Fuller's films run the gamut from low brow Ed Wood-like total crap to great moments and writing that rival the best moments in a Stanley Kubrick or Martin Scorsese film. Yet, he never had total control over any of his material. Even his magnum opus, the terrific war film The Big Red One, was butchered by its studio, and not restored until nearly a quarter century later. Similarly, The Naked Kiss was butchered to a point where Fuller threatened to have his name removed from it. In some ways, this film superficially resembles Federico Fellini's Nights Of Cabiria, save that Kelly ends up getting the upper hand, in true Hollywood fashion, albeit in a way that Hollywood would never allow. All of Fuller's films are didactic treatises where his characters, usually outcasts and reprobates, do the things that `good people' should do, but are too fearful to do. A Fullerian antihero walks the walk that typical Hollywood characters are only willing to talk. Fuller empathizes with the lowlifes in his films, even as he condemns their lifestyles, taking the most Christian ideal of loving the sinner while hating the sin to heart. Of course, there is a big ethical difference between harmless prostitution and wicked pedophilia, yet it is prostitution that gets a dressing down as a social evil from Kelly, while pedophilia merely gets a death blow, and no such direct address. Fuller also takes a very unique approach to triteness by not just using clichs but wallowing in their excesses until they have to be accepted as part of his slightly askew universe. Only then does he show his traces of originality.

  Still, many of his metaphors are too forced- such as his equation of Grant's pedophilia with the hypocrisy and sexual repression of the townsfolk. It's as if one is to believe that the evils of pre-sexual liberation mores were behind Grant's perversion. Only Fuller could be daring enough to cover such a topic- as well as prostitution and abortion, yet do so in the most hackneyed ways playing against the most direct and honest. It is this meshing of disparate methods that makes Fuller so unique, even when at his worst and most pedantic. This carries over into his film style, where he is a primitive, artistically. The camerawork by cinematographer Stanley Cortez is often wobbly, off-kilter, out of focus, full of glare, and the editing is often bizarre. The soon to be released DVD, put out by The Criterion Collection, is a vast improvement over both their earlier release of the film, and a cheapo version put out by Passion Productions. While the print is very good, and on par with the earlier releases, this DVD has some good extras; unfortunately, an audio commentary is not one of them. Considering the rise of Netflix and on demand films, one would hope that the vaunted Criterion would realize that extras are the very reason people still buy DVDs. Aside from an insert booklet that features excerpts from Fuller's memoir, A Third Face, there is an essay by film critic Robert Polito. The actual extras include the original theatrical trailer (in all its hammy glory), an in depth interview with Constance Towers- who praises Fuller's ability to tell such a sexual story, by film historian Charles Dennis, from 2007, three television interview excerpts with Fuller, from England and France; all of which lend insights into the man and his work. The film score, by Paul Dunlap, wavers between the laughably predictable blaring jazz of B films of that time, especially in its opening sequence, to its pompous Classical interludes, to its retread 1940s film melodrama set pieces, to the downright awful kids' song, Bluebird Of Happiness, being replayed when Kelly discovers Grant with his niece. The use of characters with names like Candy, Griff (a name used in almost all Fuller films, based upon a dead war buddy of his), Dusty, Kip, Buff, Bunny, and Hatrack- played by future schlock star of Beyond The Valley Of The Dolls, Edy Williams, only emphasizes how willing Fuller was to go over the top, so that he could slip in his morality plays with less suspicion and more ease, by distracting would be censors with red herrings.

  Yet, compared to such stiff moralistic Hollywood fare as Charles Laughton's Night Of The Hunter, which also deals with child abuse, one can see why a film like this chose to go over the top to slip in its medicine with such candied fluff. The Naked Kiss is anomic, leaves many of its scenes open to interpretation, is over-simplistic, ahead of its time, trite, yet also has moments of true human emotion. It is the definition of that work of art which is definitely not great, but, in a sense, essential, for it perfectly distills the contradictions of a time between the repressed black and white morality of the Cold War 1950s and the sludgy gray of the coming morass of Civil Rights Era abuses and mass murder in Vietnam. But, when all of that is said and one, it's just a fun film to watch, beyond any analysis, and that's a rare enough quality in any age.",1339027200,4,5026,4.797921478060046

I would like to say that the viewer will be treated to an exceptional film noir but, unfortunately, the film winds up as an overly-dramatic, overly-sappy B movie.  We begin with a bald prostitute beating a man unconcious with her shoe.  Shocking, yes, and it gives the viewer the impression they are about to see something on the order of 'Psycho' or 'Repulsion'.  Instead, our protaganist, Kelly, (Constance Towers) winds up as fallen woman making admends for her former life by working in a crippled children's hospital, struggling to keep a friend from becomming a prostitute and working her way up the social ladder in a small town.  She meets and falls for the town's local millionaire and things seem fine until, we once again find Kelly beating a man, this time to death.  The man is her fiance.  The dead man is determined to be a pedophile (although we are hard pressed to figure out just what it is the man was doing) and our film finally ends with Kelly vindicated.  Yep, that's the plot and I'm not sorry I spoiled it.

It has been rumored that the studio changed and altered Samuel Fuller's work and the result is what you see.  With a plethora of dark topics to work with, the film just lays there, better fit for a Frank Capra touch than film noir.  Prostitution and child molesting are sensationalist topics, even today, and this is what keeps 'The Naked Kiss' on the shelves, that and the name Fuller in the credits.

 In this 1964 release from writer-director Samuel Fuller, Ms. Towers plays a hooker who moves to a small town and decides to change her life.  She goes to work as a nurse's aide in a hospital for disabled children and also, over a period of time, falls in love with the town's leading, wealthiest citizen (Michael Dante), who turns out not to be such a prize catch after all.  Anthony Eisley plays a gritty local cop who knows her secret, and Virginia Grey is the madam of the local brothel, who doesn't have a ""heart of gold"".

 In its day, THE NAKED KISS was quite the shocker.  It dealt with (or hinted at) such then-taboo subjects as prostitution, abortion and even pedophilia in bold ways that were foreign to American film audiences.  Unfortunately, like many once-controversial movies, the handling of these topics are now so dated that, at times, they are almost laughable.

  The opening sequence with Towers beating up her pimp with her shoe, and an unexpected plot twist mid-film are still quite effective, but for the most part, the obviously low budget movie is filled with staid dialogue, performances and direction.

 Actually, the best part of this DVDs is not the movie, but the extras, a feast for fans of Sam Fuller.  It features an engrossing, fairly recent on-camera interview with Ms. Towers, who looks terrific, and three lengthy documentaries about or interviews with Fuller.

The film has received a new, high-definition digital transfer from Criterion.

32584,5,0780021088,"""The Naked Kiss"" is in-your-face pulp fiction, written, directed, and produced by Sam Fuller in 1964. It's reminiscent of film noir, but with an effrontery and moralism that makes it unique. The opening scene is one of cinema's most memorable, as cinematographer Stanley Cortez' camera stares into the eyes of a call girl as she beats the living daylights out of her pimp. Soon Kelly (Constance Towers) is on the run from the pimp, eventually landing in the small town of Grantville. In spite of her elegance, she's immediately spotted by the local sheriff, Griff (Anthony Eisley), who tells her she can't shop her wares in town. He recommends a brothel in the town across the river. But Kelly decides she would prefer a new line of work at the town's orthopedic rehab hospital, where she has a talent for inspiring the handicapped children.

Kelly is an odd woman. Lovely, poised, a cool cookie whose worldliness gives her an acute sense of what goes on around her. But she erupts in a violent rage when she is morally outraged. Sam Fuller makes her both Madonna and whore, a kind of Hester Prynne who is exalted above the hypocrisy around her. Constance Towers inflects her tone of voice from high to low depending upon what moral plane Kelly is supposed to inhabit. It's odd, but no moreso than anything else in ""The Naked Kiss"". The characters speak of two world's: the ""normal"" good world and the seedy underbelly. Kelly dreams of moving from one to the other. Griff is unconvinced that she can and always doubts her sincerity. Fuller uses Kelly's plight to comment on society's hypocrisy. But he seems to agree that the aberrant world is bad, while believing firmly that people can be redeemed, even hypocrites.

The DVD (Criterion Collection 1998): This print is not bad but neither is it perfect. It has some white specks. Sound is good. The only bonus feature is a theatrical trailer (2 min). The film is widescreen (1.66:1), so if you're considering buying it on VHS to get a better print, keep in mind that it will be pan-and-scan.",1248393600,,2042,4.73314606741573
32585,4,0780021088,"Sam Fuller's The Naked Kiss is one of those strange cult films that is so bad and so inherently odd that it begins to grow on you. The film attempts to present the underbelly of American post war society for what it is. The suburbs may look fresh and clean but they are filled with moral decay.

Kelly (Constance Towers) is a former prostitute who moves to Grantsville to begin a new life. There she becomes involved with the town police Captain, Griff (Anthony Eisley) who sees her only for what she once was. In her new life she becomes the towns hero: working with handicapped children and falling in love with the great grandson of the founder of the town and chief philantropist Grant (Michael Dante). But like all good noir there are terrible secretes hiding just under the surface and this film is no exception.

Fuller uses every trick in the book to take us into his world. There is stilted dialogue, over acting,  way too much music,and a town that looks so phony it could only have come from Hollywood yet surprisingly it all works in the end.

While this is not one of Critereon's best efforts it is perfectly watchable. It provides no real extras except the trailer.",1246320000,,1179,4.547169811320755
32586,5,0780021088,"I recently viewed the Critereon edition of THE NAKED KISS (1964), director's Sam Fuller raw, brutal yet at the same time sentimental and charming expose of ""one of the truths behind the American way of life"" circa 1964.

To say that Sam Fuller's films are ""the cinema of the extreme "" is to understate the situation.  Mr. Fuller seemed to believe he could illustrate his theories of why things are the way they are by usng the most extreme examples in every story and idea.

In THE NAKED KISS, Sam Fuller might be saying that because our society is structured the way it is,  women and children are pretty much unprotected when a socially acceptable appearing predator, expecially one with wealth and position, comes calling on society's most helpless potential victims.

THE NAKED KISS has sharp contrast B&W cinematography, beautiful musical interludes and enough shocking situations to fill several films from the same era.  I think that it is the juxtoposition of these contrasts, one right after another that really make this film dig into your psyche, at least while you're viewing it.

As I said, some of the contrasts are quite jarring but the overall theme is smoothly delivered and sort of sneaks up on you, even now, in 2009.
Yes, violence gets the story moving and pretty much resolves the criminal situation but Sam Fuller's larger question remains: How can this situation be allowed to exist? A startling question in 1964 and an even more urgent question in 2009.

The Critereon edition of THE NAKED KISS has no extras save the trailer & scene selections feature, something of a disapppointment.  I gave this film a five star rating because if you give THE NAKED KISS half a chance it'll grab at your consciousness and won't let you go for some time.",1245628800,,1764,4.795379537953796

He followed up in 1964 with this even more brutal story of small town corruption. Fuller's films from this era were pulp novels brought to the screen, hard-hitting stories of troubled and troubling souls, laced with over-the-top physical and emotional violence and twisted by mawkish sentimentality.

The Naked Kiss tells the story of a big city prostitute who finds small town America no place to reform. Try as she might to leave her past behind, the dark secrets of her adopted Grantville, and the cathouse across the river, continue to dog her. Fuller shot this on the cheap, and the cardboard quality of the back lot settings add wonderfully to the feeling that everything and everyone is projecting a faade. The uneven pacing - some scenes languish, some cut sharply - gives the picture an emotional jumpiness that matches its subject, and Fuller's uses close-ups to startle the viewer into direct confrontation with the protagonists.

Fuller's script bluntly weighs the relative morality of prostitution, corruption, out-of-wedlock pregnancy, and child abuse. The acting is just as sensationalistic as the themes, with Constance Towers as a hooker whose hardened exterior hides a sensitive intellect within. Not the stereotype hooker-with-a-heart-of-gold, but a human being with external awareness of her own predicaments. The male leads, Anthony Eisley as the police captain and Michael Dante as the love interest, are just the opposite, professionals who harbor dark, predatory secrets within.

This is by no means fine cinema, but it makes good on Fuller's philosophy that film is all about emotion. Even the oddly staged musical number is part of the creep show as Towers, having settled into a job as a nurse at a children's orthopedic hospital, practices with her physically crippled charges. Fuller spared no cinematic effort - within his miniscule budgets - in provoking viewers, and his journalistic storytelling combines with black-and-white cinematography to keep a believable edge on even the most outlandish elements of the script. Critereon's DVD includes the original theatrical trailer as the only bonus. 3-1/2 stars, if allowed fractional ratings. [2009 hyperbolium dot com]",1233964800,,3060,6.741772151898735

32590,3,0780021088,"Maverick American filmmaker Sam Fuller was both a progressive and a prude, and no film of his better illustrates this schismic personal dichotomy, echoed in his art's use of high and low techniques, than his 1964 black and white film noir melodrama The Naked Kiss, a cult classic whose title derives from its lead character, a prostitute named Kelly, who describes the kiss of the fiance she kills, that way, meaning she could tell he was a sexual deviant from the get go. It's a film that has brilliance, inanity, memorable scenes of realism, and trite predictable scenes of sheer fantasy- such as the mention of the titular act, which is not real, but works symbolically to explain certain elements of the lead character's behavior.
  That lead character, a hooker named Kelly, is played by B film mainstay Constance Towers, whose decades of acting in low budget films gave her the limited sort of celebrity appeal that only grows with time. For the last few years more people have become familiar with her role as the evil Helena Cassadine on the ABC soap opera General Hospital than in all her previous roles combined, but The Naked Kiss may be her most memorable film role. The film opens with a bang- a shot of Kelly beating the crap out of a man with her purse. He's her pimp, Farland, but he has been cheating her. After she knocks him out she takes only the $75 owed to her, and not a penny more. But, in their struggle, he pulls off her wig, to reveal her as bald. He has shaved her as an act of revenge for a perceived betrayal. It is one of the most kinetic and memorable openings in film history. After getting her money, Kelly puts her wig back on, while looking in a mirror and primping, as the title credits roll. Already, Fuller has set up the character as a `bad girl', but one with scruples. She will be the classic `hooker with a heart of gold', but Fuller goes beyond the stereotype, although he does so only by saturating the viewer with so many other stereotypes and clichs that one is forced to deal with the surfeit as its own raison d'etre.
  Only Fuller's films run the gamut from low brow Ed Wood-like total crap to great moments and writing that rival the best moments in a Stanley Kubrick or Martin Scorsese film. Yet, he never had total control over any of his material. Even his magnum opus, the terrific war film The Big Red One, was butchered by its studio, and not restored until nearly a quarter century later. Similarly, The Naked Kiss was butchered to a point where Fuller threatened to have his name removed from it. In some ways, this film superficially resembles Federico Fellini's Nights Of Cabiria, save that Kelly ends up getting the upper hand, in true Hollywood fashion, albeit in a way that Hollywood would never allow. All of Fuller's films are didactic treatises where his characters, usually outcasts and reprobates, do the things that `good people' should do, but are too fearful to do. A Fullerian antihero walks the walk that typical Hollywood characters are only willing to talk. Fuller empathizes with the lowlifes in his films, even as he condemns their lifestyles, taking the most Christian ideal of loving the sinner while hating the sin to heart. Of course, there is a big ethical difference between harmless prostitution and wicked pedophilia, yet it is prostitution that gets a dressing down as a social evil from Kelly, while pedophilia merely gets a death blow, and no such direct address. Fuller also takes a very unique approach to triteness by not just using clichs but wallowing in their excesses until they have to be accepted as part of his slightly askew universe. Only then does he show his traces of originality.
  Still, many of his metaphors are too forced- such as his equation of Grant's pedophilia with the hypocrisy and sexual repression of the townsfolk. It's as if one is to believe that the evils of pre-sexual liberation mores were behind Grant's perversion. Only Fuller could be daring enough to cover such a topic- as well as prostitution and abortion, yet do so in the most hackneyed ways playing against the most direct and honest. It is this meshing of disparate methods that makes Fuller so unique, even when at his worst and most pedantic. This carries over into his film style, where he is a primitive, artistically. The camerawork by cinematographer Stanley Cortez is often wobbly, off-kilter, out of focus, full of glare, and the editing is often bizarre. The DVD, put out by Passion Productions, has no extras, but the print is surprisingly high in quality- better than some of the titles put out by bigger companies like Fox-Lorber or The Criterion Collection.
  Yet, compared to such stiff moralistic Hollywood fare as Charles Laughton's Night Of The Hunter, which also deals with child abuse, one can see why a film like this chose to go over the top to slip in its medicine with such candied fluff. The Naked Kiss is anomic, leaves many of its scenes open to interpretation, is over-simplistic, ahead of its time, trite, yet also has moments of true human emotion. It is the definition of that work of art which is definitely not great, but, in a sense, essential, for it perfectly distills the contradictions of a time between the repressed black and white morality of the Cold War 1950s and the sludgy gray of the coming morass of Civil Rights Era abuses and mass murder in Vietnam. But, when all of that is said and one, it's just a fun film to watch, beyond any analysis, and that's a rare enough quality in any age.",1221782400,2,5517,4.66289825282631
32601,4,0780021088,"The first scene: (This film has one of the best first scenes of all-time.) A tall buxom brunette wearing only a black bra is wrestling with a man in a living room. The man seems to be losing consciousness but before he blacks out he rips off the woman's wig exposing her bald head. She re-attaches and re-adjusts her wig and flees.

The second scene: A woman (the same as the one in the first scene) now blonde, exits a bus on a bright day. Its a typical American town. She's all legs and lipstick and sunshine and smiles. All the men stare, the boldest chats her up. Turns out she is a traveling salesman or woman, named Kelly, and shes selling ""Angel Foam"" champagne. The guy talking her up is the town cop, Griff, and he decides to buy a bottle. The two end up at his place.

Kelly, it turns out is a call girl, but shes a call girl whose decided that she has performed her last trick. The town that she has chosen to reform in, however, needs some reforming of its own. It seems every woman that arrives in town is greeted by Griff who then sets them off on one of two career paths: working as a nurse in the town hospital or working at Candy's Salon as a ""bon bon"" girl. Its the guys who rule this town called Grantville, the girls just work there. After spending some time working in the hospital for handicapped children as well as assisting the abused women of the town, Kelly becomes a kind of hero. But after she finds that her fiance, the most powerful man in town, has committed an unspeakable crime, in retaliation she commits one herself and ends up in the town jail, vilified by all. Its only then that we learn what happened in that first scene.

The only way to vindicate herself is if all the women of the town stand together.

Samuel Fuller is a legend for breaking with Hollywood conventions and making pictures without Hollywood stars, and without your usual Hollywood characters and storylines, and, most importantly, without your usual Hollywood sensibility. I suppose that it is tempting to say that Fuller is interested in a more realistic vision of life than the visions of life offered by the Hollywood directors, but that doesn't really do justice to Fuller for his vision of life and his aesthetic is not realistic but  expressionistic (at times even surrealistic). Fuller certainly understands cinema and the fact that it is not reality but a heightened version of reality. His aesthetic is, therefore, no more realistic than any other directors aesthetic. Some call Fuller's a B-film aesthetic, but that term is too generic and ""B-film"" usually means artless, and there's plenty of ""art"" in Fuller's vision. I think the right word to describe the Fuller vision and aesthetic is ""carnivalesque"". That word suggests a recognition of appetites, of carnal desire, and of the fact that most of us mask our appetites and desires and distance ourselves from them by rationalizing and/or refining them until they are unrecognizable. A Fuller film can do many things, but rationalize and refine are not in his arsenal. He uses cinema to lay bare, to expose the raw and unrefined truth (as he sees it).

Fuller is obviously drawn to the odd lurid characters that Hollywood (and America) either marginalizes, exploits, or ignores. His films serve as a  reminder that the marginalized, the exploited, and the ignored also have stories to tell. This makes Fuller a kind of chronicler and champion of the abused. This in itself is admirable, but this praise is complicated by the fact that Fuller doesn't just tell their stories and thus humanize the marginalized, exploited, and ignored. Rather, he evolves an aesthetic that allows us to feel what it feels like to be one of the marginalized, exploited, and ignored.

Maybe the most disconcerting thing about a Fuller film is that Fuller knows full well how to exploit his material and the audience's appetite for the lurid. (No one would doubt that his films work very well as voyeuristic thrill and chill rides into the forbidden and the taboo.) But he also does more than that. Fuller's films also allow the viewer/voyeur to both identify with the alienated creatures on the screen and to be on their side. This is what is so innovative and so countercultural about his work.

NAKED KISS is a raw film. The viewer has been trained by countless Hollywood films to gaze at the vixens and villains on the screen , but Fuller's films have served as a countercultural alternative to mainstream cinema, and they invite us to relate with and examine what is on the screen in a different way than a mainstream film does. The films of Fuller ask us to relate to whats on the screen in a more intimate way. His characters and stories are lurid and seedy but there is also something genuine and authentic seething within them. Fuller peels away the cool exterior to expose the hidden and explosive truths not just about other people but about us. The more we learn about the exploited and the more we identify with them, the more difficult it is to see them as separate.

I would not call Fuller's films masterpieces, but I don't think that is what he's trying to create. They are more like experiments with a medium and an aesthetic. Sometimes the experiments are awkward and sometimes shocking but there is a power and an honesty in Fuller's amateurism and his awkwardness that is absent from most other cinematic art.

Some will find the over the top dialogue, situations, camera work, editing and acting to be too exaggerated, but those that enjoy the classy seediness will eat this up. Even I had to do a double-take and rewind, when the little girl skips out of the house, finding it hard to believe after everything else, they still found a way to sneak pedophilia into the mix.

The acting is kind of wooden; everyone is playing their roles in this morality drama. The sexual double entendres are clumsy...this is not Bogart and Bacall. It is definitely more frank than a lot of movies in terms of issues raised, but it's not like the story arises from a Leave It To Beaver kind of atmosphere. The small town of Grantville she comes to seems almost like a community that's been nuked. Hardly any people around. Maybe he just couldn't get enough extras, but there's no warmth to this town. I see it more as sort of an early exurbian town, you really don't know people yet, and where people are on the move a lot and no one knows each other. The brothel is ""across the river."" Anyway, I would group it with other morality message movies of the 50s and 60s. A lot of heavy symbolism. Has almost an Invasion of the Body Snatchers feel to it (the original one). The final scene, with the close ups of these anguished faces that are really hard to read...that was great.

The statuesque Constance Towers is the prostitute named Kelly and eventually she arrives at a new town where she ultimately decides to start a new life that leads to her working with disabled children. Certain aspects of her past experiences lead her to conclusions that are unspeakable about the ""normal"" society that she has now established herself in. This is truly a remarkable film because director- writer Fuller takes the viewer to avenues of unexpected emotional response both subtle and outlandish touching raw nerves along the way leaving one disconcerted and devastated.  The chiaroscuro cinematography by Stanley Cortez shooting the light and dark elements of Constance Towers face and figure within each frame lends to the off beat and sensational visual expression of this torn figure of a woman.

32609,5,0780021088,"""The Naked Kiss"" is an insult to anyone who has ever believed in the innocence and purity of small town America and is, frankly, a slap in the face to all dearly held notions of Jeffersonian idealism. And that's not all it gets right. It is also a film of intense bravado and cunning originality. Unlike most studio efforts of the time, Sam Fuller's 1964 film is simply bursting with an energy and edge rarely witnessed in cinema. The film is certainly rough and often crudely wrought, but is so often invigorating and compelling that any slight missteps are easily forgiven. It comes across as a film with a mission, made by people determined to expose and crack the gilded veneer of both American movies and American life. The film was widely banned across America, and why wouldn't it be? It is not only critical but downright insulting. It doesn't appeal to any notions of sentiment to make its point, but instead directly confronts and charges its audience with unflinching determination. And it is this honesty, this aggression, this forthwith condemnation, that makes the film as invigorating and perhaps important to watch now as it was in 1964.

To declare a film oppositional in nature is a slippery slope. It is especially tricky some forty years after its release when it has been so fully consumed and canonized as to even meet certain high priced, special edition `criteria' for greatness. But despite our culture's tendency to castrate opposition through absorption, ""The Naked Kiss"" is about as good an example of confrontational film as one can find. The story, or an urban prostitute come to settle in rural America, is as bold and challenging a tale as ever before presented in movies. It pulls all punches in telling the story too, throwing out words such as `hooker', `prostitute', and `molestation' with a determination to have them heard and heard loud. Its intent is to rattle a few cages, and rattle it does through this tale of small town corruption and common place perversion. It has also a fight to pick with the timidity of American movies, and makes its point with energetic and truly unique cinematic techniques. The cinematography is bold and creative; using techniques of lighting and focus to draw attention to the film's jagged edge. The editing too is creative enough to be noticeable and just rough enough to be subversive. The film draws attention to itself as a film and corrupts its own claims to realism and it is this rejection of a succinct and realized paradigm that calls our own into question. The film grabs a hold of your attention and proceeds to tell you what's wrong with you and it and the whole damn system. And you can't help but listen.

The film is intentionally shrewd and expertly flawed, but that does not stop the talent that is behind it from shining through. Sam Fuller was a talented and perceptive filmmaker, who, when allowed to run his own show, made films of great energy and nearly unparalleled originality. His sense of story and character is matched only by his inventiveness behind the camera. Take the opening sequence of ""The Naked Kiss"", where Constance Towers beats a man with a shoe before taking his money and reapplying a wig to her shaven head over the credits. The sequence grabs your attention like few others could, due in part to Towers directly beating the camera, which brings a certain chaos and energy to the scene that sets the tone for the entire film. Notice also certain shots of Towers where the background is not only out of focus but twisted and hazy to an unsettling degree. It is touches like this that bring this story and the intent of the film to full realization. The acting too is unique and skilled, with Towers especially being just succinct enough to be believable and yet odd enough to be dissident.

I could write so much more on this film and still fear that I have not said enough. In a nut shell the film is great, but not in a strictly conventional way. It is great in its willingness to experiment, in its determination to confront, and in its refusal to conform. The film is a grenade, both in its direct opposition to social and cultural mores of the time, and in its more subtle determination to expose its own fabrication. It is not a tidy film, it is not smooth in any way, and you may have the sensation that something is not quite right with it. Pay attention to this though, and consider its implications, and you will find watching ""The Naked Kiss"" an invigorating and worthwhile experience.",1156896000,6,4512,4.708860759493671
32610,3,0780021088,"A Gratin of spastic awkward forced contoversy fisting its way stiffly through its 1950's girdle, Naked Kiss seeks to be a controversial film yet doesn't feel remotely real in any way. Comically sad and stiffly acted, it is the epitome of a 1950's ""B"" movie (although a ""B"" may be somewhat kind) it is the vegas lounge singer of movies not purposefully campy or kitsch, it truly tries to get off the ground but has no wings... or legs for that matter yet it nobly pushes forth its best effort and THAT is the stuff of which genres are born.

In many ways, this film is kind of what the transition between the '50's & '60's were about. An awkward attempt to grow up too fast without knowing how. We get to watch the spasmotic growing pains of the ""Me generation"" pushing farther & faster than they can handle.

32622,4,0780021088,"Taken by many as one of Sam Fuller's masterpieces, THE NAKED KISS is so completely over-the-top that it seems to create a world all its own. Perhaps the most fascinating thing about it is that the film seems to be advertising itself as a form of hyperrealism in its sensational exploitation of prostitution, child molestation, civic corruption, and (above all) capitalism, yet everything it does is so operatic and charged with hallucinatory detail that it might as well be taking place in Narnia and Middle Earth. The bordello in the film's locale, for example, features prostitutes who ply their wares wearing high heels, teddies, and giant satin heart-shaped headpieces; the hospital for handicapped children seems to force all its patients to wear pirate hats around the clock (even to bed!). And there's no explanation offered for even smaller details, such as why the film's heroine (a former hooker trying to walk the straight and narrow) handles all problems large or small by adminstering vicious beatings, or even why she is almost the only character in the entire film who goes by her first name (rather than by her last name, as Griff and Grant do, or by an exotric moniker, as in the case of Bunny, Buff, Marshmallow, and Hatrack). It might be mere camp, given this surrealism and also the lusciously overripe dialogue Fuller provides his characters, but it becomes genuinely elevated to a much higher level by the artistry of Fuller's sensational direction, particularly in the phenomenal opening scenes involving the (temporarily balded!) heroine beating her pimp and her pick-up by the town's corrupt cop; by the beautiful cinematography of Stanley Cortez; and by the very sincere and thoughtful performance in the lead role of Constance Towers, who is rather like a more expressive Tippi Hedren and who gets to display her beautiful singing voice in yet another of the film's bizarre and inexplicable plot turns.",1149811200,5,1929,5.069182389937107
32623,4,0780021088,"This review is for the 1998 Criterion DVD.

The movie revolves around a nomadic prostitute named Kelly (Constance Towers) who comes to a small town and as luck would have it, her first client or ""john"" is a local plainclothes policeman, who clearly has too much free time on his hands, named Captain Griff. The morning after her ""trick"" with this self-righteous, sexually-exploitive cop, she takes a long look in the mirror and decides to become Mother Superior and work in a local hospital for disabled kids.  Later, Kelly meets one of the country's most eligible bachelors, J.L. Grant, who also happens to be Captain Griff's best friend.  Kelly impresses J.L. by being the beautiful and brilliant ""renaissance woman"" and they fall in love and plan to marry.  But between Griff's knowledge of Kelly's past and J.L.'s dark, hidden secret, things just don't go as planned.

The movie was clearly shot on a shoestring budget.  The acting is at times suspect and there are instances where the macabre and controversial issues aren't ""sold"" that well to the audience.  I have to give the film some credit in that it takes on a number of taboos issues for 1964 and even today such as prostitution, abortion and criminal sexual perversion, and clearly chastises behaviors as morally repugnant.  The one topic that it glazed over with no proper recourse was the hypocrisy of the sexual relationship of the police captain with Kelly.  But all in all, it's a movie that's interesting to watch, but personally, I didn't feel entertained by the topics nor was I impressed with the overall production of the film.

The B&W widescreen transfer is a minor disappointment - especially since this was released by of all companies, Criterion.  Tiny specs of deterioration were observable throughout the entire picture.  I guess this was one of Criterion's earlier projects and they've certainly flattened the learning curve since.  Another ""Un-Criterion"" disappointment was that the only bonus is the original trailer.

32624,5,0780021088,"Sam Fuller was well ahead of his time and that shows in most of his movies but this  in my opinion was probably his best film. It is almost indefinable.

From the first few minutes of the movie when we find ourselves in an unexplained and unprefaced violent fast action darkly lit sequence of a knock down drag out fight between a man and a woman who in the process looses her wig to reveal her bald head, to quote the Wizard of Oz, we realize are not in Kansas anymore.

  The first time I watched this movie  after the initial scene of violence the film  almost seemed like a bad ""b movie"" except that it continued to show strange little nuances of brilliance. The combination makes one both entertained, off balance and uneasy.

  Constance Towers plays Kelly  is a prostitute who tries to escape her past but her initial attempt lands her back in a house of ill repute. Finally fed up with that life she tries again to move to quaint Grantville where she  finds work as a nurse working with children. She catches the eye of the town's leading citizen (aptly named Grant). They fall in love but Kelly finally feels compelled to tell Grant about her past. Rather than be repulsed he proposes marriage. He too has a secret life.

  The studio edited some of the scenes of the original film and Fuller threatened to take his name off the picture but the edits, some of which are obvious, I believe are ""happy accidents"" that actually contribute to the power of the film.

  Somehow Sam Fuller takes all the elements of a trashy movie and makes them into  a surreal social commentary.",1117584000,5,1583,4.472027972027972
32625,5,0780021088,"""EMOTIONAL VIOLENCE!"" shrieks the trailer to Samuel Fuller's 1964 B-movie extravaganza ""The Naked Kiss,"" and you'll believe that claim eventually even though it initially causes a snicker. Fuller, arguably more than any other American director of the time, helped push Hollywood far beyond the staid, cookie cutter studio productions of the 1930s, 1940s, 1950s, and early 1960s. Here's a film that is a real envelope pusher, a film that deals with themes that must have absolutely shocked audiences of the 1960s to the core of their being. Heck, ""The Naked Kiss"" still has the power to shock today, and that's saying something about a black and white film that is now forty years old. Fuller, who had begun challenging film audiences much earlier with such films as ""Pickup on South Street"" and ""Shock Corridor,"" went on to produce, write, and direct other notable films. Before watching ""The Naked Kiss,"" the only Fuller picture I knew about was his homage to the fighting men of World War II, 1980's ""The Big Red One."" According to information gleaned during several Internet excursions, the French in particular embraced Fuller even as American audiences forgot about him. The recent DVD explosion is sure to rekindle a love for the man's films on this side of the Atlantic.

We see a good deal of that emotional violence--as well as a dose of physical violence--in the opening scenes of ""The Naked Kiss,"" as an aging yet still attractive harridan named Kelly (Constance Towers) pummels her pimp senseless with a high-heeled shoe. She's striking out on her own, taking a sum of money from her now prostrate boss in order to make her escape. Kelly feels that the years of abuse and degradation have rendered her useless and decrepit, and she hopes a new start will restore a modicum of her youthful zest for life. Two years later, we see our heroine stepping off a bus in Grantville, U.S.A., a place that makes ""Leave it to Beaver"" look like South Central Los Angeles. This town is so saccharine, so picture perfect in that 1950s Hollywood way that you start to wonder exactly where Fuller is taking us. Not to worry. Kelly immediately runs into police detective Griff (Anthony Eisley), a man who hangs around the bus station all day picking up women like Kelly. We also learn that Griff exploits these women by first luring them into a physical encounter before sending them off to a brothel owner named Candy (Virginia Grey). Kelly knows none of this at the start, but she learns quickly after Griff slips her a twenty for the time they spend together. Our woman is appalled at her lapse, so much so that she swears off the life forever and takes up work as a nurse at a local hospital for disabled children.

Things start looking up for Kelly after she takes her new position at the hospital. The hapless souls in her charge buoy her flagging spirits, making her feel as though she's really contributing something to the world. She also gets the opportunity to help out a few women, Dusty (Karen Conrad) and Buff (Marie Devereux), caught up in similar problems she once faced. But the best aspect of Kelly's transformation from harridan to hospital hero is the attention she receives from Grant (Michael Dante), Grantville's primary philanthropist and a beloved figure around town. This guy heaps praise on Kelly, wooing her with his fancy friends, gifts picked up in foreign lands, and his forgiving nature. Even after Grant learns about Kelly's past, in no small part due to Griff's interference, he still offers to marry her. Things couldn't seem better, right? It's around this point that Fuller drops the cinematic equivalent of a nuclear bomb into the proceedings. Towers's character discovers a shocking secret concerning Grant and the town's children, a secret so devastating that she lashes out at her fianc and accidentally kills him. Her new life shatters as every enemy, and even every friend, she has comes out of the woodwork to excoriate her. It's only through a few lucky breaks that Kelly clears herself of a murder charge, but she must leave Grantville with her reputation in tatters.

I watched ""The Naked Kiss"" with my girlfriend, and we had a grand time with Fuller's seedy film. We roared, guffawed, and giggled through roughly the first hour of the film. How could we not? The dialogue is hilarious, those children singing in the hospital will make you howl with pain, and Kelly's hard as nails behavior is a real hoot. You simply must love the scene where she charges into the local brothel in order to batter a squawking and squealing Candy into submission. Go get 'em, Kelly! And that mannequin in her room where she stays after first arriving in Grantville! Oh brother! Yep, ""The Naked Kiss"" is a real trashy laughfest--until Fuller drops the bomb. When Grant's true nature comes to light, my girlfriend and I quit laughing in a hurry. From this point until the end of the movie, you could have heard a pin drop in my living room. As the credits roll, it becomes abundantly clear that Fuller made a masterpiece. Any film that can change gears so effectively, essentially turning cinematic conventions of the time on their head in the process, deserves our praise.

The Criterion Collection again performs miracles bringing a screen classic to DVD. The picture quality looks amazing for such an old film. Unfortunately, you'll need to pick up Criterion's version of Fuller's ""Pickup on South Street"" if you want plenty of extras, as the only bonus included here is the EMOTIONAL VIOLENCE! trailer. ""The Naked Kiss"" is a must see film, and one that will stay with me for some time.

May be this was the main reason why this film was underrated. Too much high point temperature in the social body of USA in that moment.

Her ""tout"" shaved her head bald while she was passed out and she beats the hell out of him with her clutch bag! She splits and becomes a traveling hooker. (Well, I guess it beats peddling Mary Kaye.) She winds up in a very small town and her first customer is the local cop. Coming to like the small town life, she rents a room from a sweet old lady who has her own sad story and decides to go straight. But the cop is nervous about having Kelly around so he sends her across the river to a whorehouse run by Candy who takes a liking to her and offers her a job as one of her ""Bon-Bons"". But Kelly nixes the offer and goes back to the small town and gets a job as a nurse's aide in the crippled children's wing of the local hospital. There she finds what she's been looking for---purpose. Kelly is really a good person. But she has to make one more trip across the river to Candy's. She beats the hell out of Candy (with that trusty clutch bag again) for trying to recruit a down-on-her-luck co-worker at the hospital. She then stuffs the money Candy had given the girl right in Candy's mouth. Then things really begin to happen. A rich guy who's the ""pillar"" of the community wants to marry her and Kelly thinks she's met her Prince Charming until she catches him molesting a little girl! That nasty temper flares again and she shoots him. Of course this isn't the end but I can't say any more. The serpentine story never stops. The acting is first rate and the cast is perfect for each of their individual roles. Especially Constance Towers as Kelly and Virginia Grey as Candy. The two have memorable confrontations. As Kelly sits in jail for murder, Candy is called in to give a statement. She does. She says to Kelly, ""Nobody stuffs dirty money in MY mouth!""

It begins with a woman attacking a man! Her wig falls off. She takes the $75 coming to her, and her wig. She applies her make-up and leaves. The year is 1961. Next its 1963, people wait at a bus station. A woman steps off the bus, men watch her. She sells champagne, $10 a bottle. She hooks up with the cop. He tells her to get out of town; go across the river to Candys salon. I never make change she says. Kelly stares at the mirror. She finds a pleasant room for rent. Griff stops at Candys Salon. Kelly learns about this towns founder and benefactor. Kelly works at the hospital with crippled children. Griff argues with her about her new job; she is trying to change. Grant meets Miss Kelly and gives her an antique glass bottle from Venice. He shows her movies of Venice, taken from a gondola. Another nurse wants a new job.

Kelly offers a gown to Buff. Later Buff tells Kelly she got $25 from Candys Salon. Kelly warns her about that life. Kelly visits Candys Salon to talk to her and tell her to stay away from Buff. Kelly tells Grant about her past. But he wants to marry her. [Is this credible?] She agrees. Kelly offer help and advice to Dusty. Griff meets Kelly, they talk in private. He gives her 30 minutes to get out of town, but Kelly calls Grant. Later Grant has a confession for Kelly. She reacts by hitting him! [This may explain his actions.] There is shocking news. Griff questions Kelly about her actions. Griff brings in Kellys former procurer and Kelly explains what happened then. Later Dusty talks to Griff about Kellys help. Finally that young girl Dusty is found. Will she talk to Kelly? Yes. A court can dismiss an action, and does for Kelly. So Kelly leaves town on the bus.

This is a lower budget exploitation movie that must have been shocking for its time. Is the story believable? Could such a situation exist in a small city? Could a strange woman get a job as a nurse in a hospital? I don't think so. Religion is a big factor in small town life but is missing here.",1488844800,,2030,4.322834645669292

7789608,4,0780021088,"It's become common to compare and contrast The Naked Kiss with Fuller's Shock Corridor so I guess I'll follow the trend.

The Naked Kiss has improvements in character and plot development. Constance Towers is a much more strong-willed character than Peter Breck's character in Shock Corridor. She's not proud of being a whore, but she's not ashamed of it, either. She believes she deserves another chance. She quits the business and gets a job at a hospital for crippled orphans, which she excels at. She helps the younger female workers at the hospital to stay away from corruption and makes a difference in the young orphans' lives.

The theme of Fuller's movie is whether or not redemption and rehabilitation is possible in American society. Fuller shows that the forces of corruption and perversion threaten the weak and unfortunate on all sides. Fuller piles on the corruption very heavily, just as he wears too much sentiment on his sleeve for the crushingly cute orphans.

If anything, The Naked Kiss is better made than Shock Corridor but for that reason not as successful and effective. Constance Towers is a good actress who's up to the challenge of her role, but I think Fuller's sentimentality gets away from him. I think we're supposed to see Towers as a redeeming influence on the town. I also think that he wants to make his usual point that individuals are corrupted by large social forces such as wealth and government. Fuller's trying to be a much nicer guy in this picture, but it's not convincing because he can't have it both ways. Towers's final walk out of town seems like defeat and limitation, not triumph or lasting legacy.

This version of The Naked Kiss I'm watching shows a small picture at the center of the screen framed by large black borders all around. Pixelation is frequent and prominent. I think Stanley Cortez's work for Shock Corridor was more striking. Nonetheless, this is no way to treat the work of a man who gave us The Night Of The Hunter.",1456444800,,1984,4.775510204081633

7789610,4,0780021088,"While Douglas Sirk gave us frothy, sudsy offerings (ALL THAT HEAVEN ALLOWS, WRITTEN ON THE WIND, etc.) that tended to disguise his critique of middle-class mores with soap opera storylines, lush settings, and often garish color, he nevertheless used a directorial poniard to assassinate his targets. Not so Samuel Fuller, who used the cinematic equivalent of a blunt instrument to accomplish the same end.

Others have commented on the storyline (and in the process have given away too much of the plot) I will only say that Fuller's film goes from over the top sordidness, to idealization, to definitive crisis, to a satisfying ending (for some).

The actors give it their all. Constance Towers, whose character Kelly is looking a little worse for wear due to her past life, is riveting and she effortlessly passes through all the changes in her life following a really eye-opening and borderline funny beginning of the film to the ambiguous ending. She is ably assisted by Anthony Eisley as her tormentor/friend, the eminently watchable Virginia Grey as the hard bitten madam of the town brothel, and the chameleon-like Michael Dante who does sincerity/creepy like few other actors of his time.

As director/writer, Samuel Fuller is unsubtle, but his writing is almost as interesting as Quentin Tarantino's. While Tarantino is precise, Fuller is crude and clunky (just like his direction) but it is so interesting to hear and it really moves the action along. To confirm this for yourself, see Fuller's 40 GUNS, (starring Barbara Stanwyck) one of the weirdest and most compelling send-ups of Western films since JOHNNY GUITAR.

Just as compelling as his deconstruction of white-picket-fence America, Fuller's semi-meditation on the power of destiny is equally compelling. This is a hard movie to rate. I suppose it could be deemed a three-star or even two-star film, but I give it four stars for its sheer entertainment value. Not to mention that Criterion has given us an absolutely beautiful black-and-white print with great sound. For a change of pace, please give this film a try.",1445385600,2,2086,5.108504398826979
