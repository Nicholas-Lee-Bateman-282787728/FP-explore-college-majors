8410775,5,B0010KQO6S,"I bought the VHS video cassette, ""The Events at Garabandal"" from Amazon. The recording was in NTSC format, but I had no problem playing it on my Panasonic DMR ES 30 V combi system. By going into the setup menu I changed the output from PAL to NTSC and the cassette played on my 100 hertz Philips cathode ray tube television perfectly.

The video contains a documentary film made in 1971 by an American called Richard Everson. Mr Everson appears before the camera and tells the views all about the apparitions and messages of Our Lady at Garabandal.

Garabandal is a little village in the Cantabrian mountains in the north of Spain. It is about 55 miles from the nearest city, Santandar. It is not too far away from the Basque territory.

From 1961 Our Blessed Mother appeared to 4 young Spanish girls on an almost daily basis until 1965. She gave messages about ""Warning"", ""A Great Miracle"", a ""Chastisement"" and about the new era to come. She also said the rosary with the girls and thought them to become holy and respectful towards priests.

Accompanying the apparitions were many strange phenomena, such as the girls suddenly falling down on hard rocks without hurting their knees; running backwards down rocky hilly paths in the dark without stumbling; possessing the ability to recognise priests who came to the village dressed as ordinary men; being impervious the to pin-pricks of a paediatrician while in ecstasy; returning religious objects to the correct owners without looking at the owners; possessing the ability to respond to the silent thoughts of a priest when he silently requested of Our Lady that one of the girls come out of ecstasy in order to prove to him that what he was witnessing was true.

The documentary on the video implies that we are living in the times of the Apocalypse and that the whole world will soon pass through a tremendous change.

The documentary includes actual film footage shot in Garabandal during the time of the apparitions in the early 1960s.

The documentary lasts for 45 minutes. It may also be available in PAL format and on DVD disc from some other sources on the internet.",1251936000,,2128,4.766304347826087
