4713005,5,B005JJSGBW,"I have the 2 DVD version and the Blu Ray too.
What can i say of Dream Theater?
The only two words comes my mind are PROFESSIONALITY and PERFECTION.The show is incredible and the set list is impressive and perfectly played.
In the Blu Ray disc version the picture quality is stunning (1080i) and sounds amazing in LPCM stereo (i only have a 2 channel hi end system).
So, perfect musicians, perfect set list, perfect picture quality, perfect sound mix.....all that you want DT fans!
One of the best Blu Ray disc of my collection!!!

I would beg Dream Theater to upgrade all their previous DVDs to blu-ray. I will buy them all. I just went to their ""A Dramatic Turn of Events"" concert down here in Houston, TX. I hope they will issue a blu-ray disk for that tour too.",1320624000,10,387,4.173333333333333

My verdict is that there is no difference whatsoever. Be warned; if the original production was shot in standard definition the transfer will be just the same. I'm very particular so I notice these things, however it doesn't detract from this wonderful concert performance featuring four of the best prog musicians on the planet.

4713024,5,B005JJSGBW,This is the best live concert Dream Theater has put out in my opinion. They've had other great ones but the 1st time I saw this I was glued to the screen. As a songwriter and guitarist this video was very humbling. It's one thing to hear an album and another to see them playing. They stepped up the sound quality and video quality for the Blu-Ray version and it's the only way I'll watch it now. My dvd may collect dust.,1401753600,,421,4.146341463414634

4713047,5,B005JJSGBW,"Dream Theater 'Live at Budokan' is one of a handful of concert DVDs that continues to wow me completely. On 5 October, 2004 at the peak of their abilities, Dream Theater played at the Budokan, Japan. Although eight years ago and since then they have had other concert DVDs like the majestic 'Score', this is their landmark concert High Definition DVD. This review highlights why I repurchased 'Live at Budokan' on Blu-ray.

I love watching live music and have been fortunate enough to see Dream Theater play in Brisbane, Australia and Auckland, New Zealand. This Blu-ray is possibly as good as it gets other than being at their concerts. Indeed some may say it's better. At least in the comfort of your home you can manage the volume to what suits you plus have close-up views that only binoculars could achieve. (I make this comment as the Auckland concert was excessively loud and at times there was possible distortion.)

Back to this Blu-ray which is most beautifully crafted and meets all my requirements for a perfect concert. i.e. great sound, crystal clear visuals, a massive selection from their discography plus additional long instrumental breaks with the camera following the person playing the solo. (It always frustrates me when the drummer plays a brilliant fill and the camera man zooms on the vocalist who is not even singing. This fortunately doesn't happen on this recording because Mike Portnoy, the drummer, and John Petrucci, the guitarist produce it.) Clearly Dream Theater projected their creative and hard-working ethic to the production values of this Blu-ray. The original recording had been carefully thought through, even to the placing of the cameras for excellent closeups for each member.

The original DVD was previously unsurpassed in sound and video quality. The Blu-ray version is crisper - yes, the colors more vivid and richer and what I particularly noticed was the shine and sparkle on items like the Sabian cymbals. You notice small details like the glint on wedding rings, the reflection off Petrucci's guitar. It's these details that take an already brilliant high definition DVD and makes the viewing experience even more impact full. I was taken aback as to how beautiful the primary color lighting looks on Blu-ray. This is an amazing quality recording.

Yet I did not repurchase this for a visual improvement as I had thought my existing DVD copy was great. I bought this for the DTS HD Master Audio and the sound improvement is significant. Referring to 'As I am' the opening track of the concert you immediately notice a significant improvement in the bass levels. The opening bass note of the first bar is strong and resounds with a power not experienced on the 5.1 sound.

Overall there is a greater richness on the Blu-ray as you hear the growl and tone of Myung's bass together with the warmth of Portnoy's toms. There seems far greater dynamic range with the bottom end of both the bass guitar and the bass pedal more forceful. My sub-woofer gets a real workout yet the high range notes of the keyboard still ring out. There is greater separation with no difficulty to hear all four instruments and vocals. The many rapid unison guitar and piano lines over Myung's bass is wondrous. In Petrucci's solos you can hear the subtleties of tapping plus string wrenches. If anything the sound detail also shows their flaws so LaBrie sometimes doesn't quite hit the note, but after a marathon two hour fourty-five minute concert, I am not surprised.

For those who have woken up a decade after he was already one of the world's greatest prog-rock drummers, this concert is a Mike Portnoy showcase. (Mike Portnoy is sadly no longer with DT.)  Disc two has all the extras including the Portnoy solo and the Instrumedley - which allows you to focus just on Mike for a monstrous drumming display. That doesn't mean there is no solo drumming in the concert. Far from it! You're in for a surprise as the keyboard drum battle during 'Beyond this life' is like an added drum solo. I found this the highlight of the opening barrage of 3 songs - Rudess and Portnoy seem to have such fun and Portnoy gets to inventively show off what every little cowbell, percussion and timbale sounds like on his enormous double set of drums. He really shows how musical he is as he copies Rudess's keyboard lines on the kit.(Of course a few blizzards of bass drum bliss are effortlessly displayed throughout!)

The first twenty minutes of this concert are some of the heaviest moments of synchronised Dream Theater mayhem; the end of 'This Dying Soul' shows the most frighteningly fast unison lines of Petrucci and Rudess. Mesmerising! Portnoy is so solid as he segues from one time signature into the pounding grundge time midway through 'This Dying Soul' - makes you want to bounce with LaBrie as well. As LaBrie states 'We have one hell of a show coming at you, this evening'. At this stage of the concert you're only two songs in and sixteen still to come. As on any DT creation you'll see why Petrucci is arguably the most technically gifted rock guitarist in the world today. Combined with Myung, Rudess and their powerful vocalist, LaBrie, this is the benchmark of prog metal virtuosity. If you like intense, inventive heavy rock music that requires repeated listening, this is a wonderful value Blu-ray - brilliant!",1343433600,8,5344,4.8455640744797375
4713048,5,B005JJSGBW,"I have the DVD version of this concert. Every time I watch it, I kept telling myself that this is the best DVD concert. 10 out of 10. But after watching the bluray version, I realized that I was wrong. On a scale of 1 to 10, the DVD was -1 and the bluray was a 12. I heard music from the bluray that I have never heard before (either it wasn't there before or I am a schizophrenic). I could hear every single instrument AND james' vocals at the same time and they were ALL crisp clear (and I am only using a 2 Wharfedale front speakers; bluray audio set to PCM 2.0). But still. Awesome. If my mouth wasn't dry when I was watching it, I would have been drooling. DT fans must buy this. If you are short on money, starve for 3 days, and then buy this (it's worth it). All music lovers, you must buy this also (starve is you need to).

I have a bunch of concert blurays (Metallica, Iron Maiden, Megadeth, Nirvana, Foo Fighters, etc. and this is by far THE BEST BLURAY CONCERT I HAVE EVER EXPERIENCED.",1336780800,7,997,4.112820512820512

8475867,5,B005JJSGBW,"Many of you already know the name Dream Theater. If you Google the words ""progressive metal"", there is a very good chance Dream Theater will show up in your results. The Long Island quintet is known for their unique sound, complex arrangements and technical proficiency. They are the band with classic albums that need no introduction (""Images and Words"" and ""Scenes from a Memory"" to name a few). And also, concert films such as the legendary ""Live at Budokan.""

""Live at Budokan"" has been out on Blu-ray for a few years now. Originally filmed in 2004, when Dream Theater was in Japan supporting their seventh LP ""Train of Thought"", this film shows the band playing the more personal and heavier cuts from their catalogue at that time. Songs from ""Train of Thought"" and ""Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence"" make up the bulk of the setlist (both albums were released back-to-back), while a few of Dream Theater's greatest hits (""Pull Me Under"", ""Hollow Years"") round it out.

Dream Theater is at the peak of their careers. Some of you may bring up their 2006 film ""Score"" as their greatest filmed achievement, but for me, ""Live at Budokan"" takes the cake. It shows the band-members being absolutely comfortable and confident with one another at all times. The quintet comes out roaring with ""As I Am"" and ""This Dying Soul"" and never lets up. The entire film is lively and makes for a very thrilling experience. ""Beyond This Life"" and ""Instrumedley"" present the listener with a daunting collection of unexpected twists and turns, guaranteed to blow his or her mind. Other tracks like the emotionally powerful ""Hollow Years"" show that Dream Theater are also fantastic songwriters. And did I mention ""Pull Me Under"", the band's only radio hit?

Dream Theater's captain, then-drummer Mike Portnoy, directs the concert film with aplomb; remarkable camera angles and strong lighting are present throughout. This is one concert that feels like a studio-quality film, with strong production value throughout. The high-definition picture is flat-out terrific. Few, if any metal concerts have this kind of polish. As for the sound: it's top-notch. No surprises there. Interestingly, the viewer is given a choice between a first-class DTS-HD MA 5.1 soundtrack, a decent LPCM 2.0 soundtrack, and a Dolby Digital 5.1 soundtrack from the old DVD. I suggest you go for the DTS-HD soundtrack. It's simultaneously crisp and deep, prominent and raw. Kevin Shirley should be commended for his terrific work on the mixing console. It's safe to say that comparing the original 2004 DVD to this Blu-ray release isn't even a contest.

One of my favorite things about Dream Theater is that they never do the same thing twice. This is evident in all of their work. For example, ""Images and Words"" was a non-stop showcase of melody and virtuosity, and ""Scenes from a Memory"" was an immersive concept album akin to the rock operas of yesterday. The band sees each of their albums and videos as the start of a fresh and exciting new journey. And true to form, Dream Theater's ""Live at Budokan"" is a journey worth taking; a must-own for any fan of Dream Theater, or metal music, or fans of great music in general.

Dream Theater circa 2004:
* Mike Portnoy (drums, vocals, director, producer)
* John Petrucci (guitars, vocals, producer)
* John Myung (bass, chapman stick)
* James LaBrie (vocals, percussion)
* Jordan Rudess (keyboards)",1483920000,,3402,4.96140350877193
