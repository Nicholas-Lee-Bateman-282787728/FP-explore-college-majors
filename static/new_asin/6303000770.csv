7833427,4,6303000770,"One thing becomes obvious after watching this one. Joan Severance is hot; in fact, she's so hot the tape caused my VCR to overheat (brought it in for repair today). Skip the R-rated version, the plot only makes sense viewing the unrated version.  After all, here you have three grown men all being manipulated by this siren one of them is married to. How could these guys be so blind? The answer is simple. Men are men, after all, and if any man thought he might have even the slightest chance with a woman who looks like Joan Severance  he would  turn a blind eye to her character's shenanigans and stay focused on her when she unbuttons her blouse. Take that Robert Davi guy. Did old craggy face actually think Joan would wait for him in the rain and get soaked just to have an excuse to  undress in front of with him? At the same time did hubby  Jack Scalia think his good looks were enough to keep his wife from straying? (I know you're having sex with somebody else - that psychiatrist maybe?) Did her psychiatrist actually believe Joan would choose him over the others if he would do the one little thing she asked for - kill Jack's ex wife. Did Jack's fellow cop James Russo really think he could steal Joan away from his best friend and partner if he would do her bidding and off a couple of people standing between her and her inheritance. ? Yes, Joan is a scheming, manipulative, conniving woman who does not plan on sharing any of the $2,000,000 she will inherit if her brother dies. Can Joan convince her husband that the guy she is seeing on the side is not the psychiatrist but is, surprise, surprise, her brother, hoping Jack will become enraged and kill her sibling? Damn right. You're no doubt thinking this is getting a little preposterous, but guess what, if you're a man and you saw Ms. Severance naked just once (never mind the four times that you see her on display in this movie) you'd be the standing in line to do her bidding. That's unfair, of course, but who said life has to be fair, especially in the movies?",1367107200,,2037,4.406914893617022
