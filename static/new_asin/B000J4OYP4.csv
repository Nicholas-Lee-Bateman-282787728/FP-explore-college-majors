2666919,5,B000J4OYP4,"As a music teacher, I am always looking for non-traditional ways to get all students involved in music.  I wish that all loved playing  instruments or singing, but that is not the case.  I found this, and I was able to show how technology has come a long way.  We discussed technology in music and the time and precision needed to make this video. I highly recommend this and all technology in music dvd's to help teach a new generation about music.",1401926400,,449,4.439024390243903
2666920,5,B000J4OYP4,I saw this while on a school trip several years ago and have searched for it for years. I am so glad that I found it and can watch it over and over again.,1398211200,,154,3.5588235294117645
2666921,5,B000J4OYP4,Great video and my students loved it. Lots of discussion about making the video and how real it was. We will watch again.,1384300800,,121,4.304347826086956
2666922,5,B000J4OYP4,This by far the most amazing musical DVD in my collection. In my opinion it is brilliant.  I congratulate the composers and computer genius who put it all together. I promise I will be getting another one next month.,1316736000,,216,4.538461538461538
2666923,5,B000J4OYP4,My 9 year old loves this DVD.  He watches it over and over and over.  It is very creative visually and musically.,1297209600,,113,4.090909090909091
2666924,5,B000J4OYP4,"Animusic is just amazing to watch. The 1st time I watched this I actually felt inspired by my fellow man....I had that type of feeling from it. The technology that goes into making this, melding with the art forms of music and animation is astoundingly fun to watch and listen to. The music is excellent, the musicianship, though computer generated is dynamic and interesting. (I'm a musician and hold a little bit of a thing against stuff like drum machines vs live performances... However in this case !) The instruments have personalities all their own. Each song is performed by different sets of instruments that play flawlessly and with character. I've played my copy for dozens of people and it is always a smash and an inspiration. Being a psychotherapist, I have used this with several of my clients to jog them into working towards something when they were down and stuck. This is classic. Bye the way, the second DVD that came out a year or so later isn't as good as this 1st one in my opinion. The 1st song on the second one is great but it falls off a bit from there. This 1st one is a must have.",1294012800,,1109,4.467980295566503
2666925,5,B000J4OYP4,I bought the Animusic 1 DVD for my 4 year old grandson who loves music and is absolutely fascinated with anything mechanical.  He was entranced watching all the instruments come to life and play the music and watched the DVD over and over until his mom had to put restrictions on how often he could watch it.  I plan on buying Animusic 2 for him for Christmas!,1284163200,,360,4.358208955223881
2666926,5,B000J4OYP4,This is a fun music video series of rendered instruments playing the music.  The songs really sick with you and are very enjoyable.,1276992000,,131,4.695652173913044
2666927,5,B000J4OYP4,"The concept behind Animusic makes for some great work. The songs are catchy and relatively simple, but the animation they produce is mesmerizing. These are the most intricate music visualizations that I know of.",1259539200,,211,5.235294117647059
2666928,5,B000J4OYP4,I think all pre school children should see this one its fantastic and will keep them thinking about music....kevin,1254009600,,114,5.052631578947368
2666929,5,B000J4OYP4,"I stumbled across one of the Animusic trailors at a local science museum.  Took me a while to find out what it was called, who made it etc.  Bought Animusic 1 and 2, and love both.  Well, I grew up programming 6502 and 68000 processors :)  That may tell you where my infatuation comes from...

2666931,5,B000J4OYP4,"I bought this for my 2 year old grandson because he loves music.  We both enjoy putting the dvd in and watching the different ""instruments"".  I really like the more upbeat music and wish there was a little more of that.  I'm happy that I bought the dvd though...",1238198400,2,262,4.3061224489795915
2666932,5,B000J4OYP4,This is a darling instrumental DVD that has some exciting new innovations in the music department.

A lovely way to teach your children about music.,1232496000,6,298,5.061224489795919
8149177,5,B000J4OYP4,"Amazing computer generated graphics.  Along with the musical compositions, the entire experience is surrealistic, but very gratifying.  I'll have to pick up the second Animusic DVD when I have the chance.  Good stuff.",1496534400,,217,5.515151515151516

I love it!",1484092800,,244,5.102564102564102
