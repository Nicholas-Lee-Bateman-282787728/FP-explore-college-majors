474982,4,6302483395,"The Lawnmower Man is a pretty cool film for those who like to think a little bit about what they watch.  Essentially it's the Frankenstein story updated for a more modern generation, but it also makes a statement about  technology and how it's development could possibly bring about our own  undoing.  The cast is very good, the effects are rather remarkable and this  DVD transfer looks excellent.  The only qualm is in regards to handling the  missing scenes as DVD 'extras' rather than include them in the picture like  the superior VHS director's cut.  This aside, the film is very good and  well worth checking out for fans of the genre.",925948800,2,642,4.702702702702703
474983,1,6302483395,"In the world of the future Pierce Brosnan will be able to take a mentally  challenged gardening guy, plug him directly into 'Cyberspace' and turn him  into the mental equivalent of King Kong. Apparently. Somehow you just have  to love the Lawnmower Man. It's cheesy, poorly acted, badly scripted and  the special effects are pure 1980's. The basic tenant of the plot of badly  flawed, there' s a superficial sex scene that looks shoehorned in to give  the movie an adult rating and Jeff Fahey (the Lawnmower man of the title)  wears the constant facial expression of one who has been assaulted in the  nether regions with a red hot poker. In short it's very poor, but if you've  nothing better to spend your money on it's easy watching when the cranial  stretching pleasures of The Price Is Right prove too much on a Saturday  afternoon  END",909100800,6,841,4.64625850340136

475029,5,6302483395,"I was in high school when this movie originally came out and I thought it was the coolest thing ever then.  Obviously, the effects are pretty dated now but a lot of the sci-fi themes it explores are still pretty applicable.  Anyway, I love the longer director's cut as well as the interviews with Brett Leonard on the tightropes he had to walk to get the sci-fi themes into it (New Line wanted a straight up horror movie).",1499385600,2,422,4.397435897435898

Have held onto my laser disc of the extended edition since I purchased it many many years ago.  FINALLY after waiting so many years,  a wonderful edition on blu-ray.  Both the theatrical as well as the extended cuts on two discs.
If you're a sci-fi person like myself don't hesitate to purchase this soon before it's completely sold out.  Even though the special effects might be just a little dated, they are still good enough to watch and truly enjoy today especially on a high quality blu-ray player and  big screen hi-def TV.  Add this to your sci-fi  library.  You won't be disappointed.

It's not the director's cut but it's still a great movie about going too far in the name of science, kinda like The Fly! It has great sound as well especially the machine gun fire during certain horror scenes and the climax at the lab.

A bit dated movie, but it's still a really fun flick for a Friday night with some popcorn.
The special effects are obviously dated, but it adds a nice, older feel to the movie.
the overall premise of out of control virtual reality devices is entertaining for sure.
And we are graced with the good looking Pierce Brosnan!

I just wish the blu ray was cheaper, guess I'll wait until it comes down.

You can't go wrong if you like sci fi. If you've never seen it you owe yourself a viewing.

475081,5,6302483395,"I was a little late to this movie as I saw the movie trailers on tv, but I never got a chance to see it until I saw it on tv 3 years after it came out in theaters.  Even as I had to grin and bear the annoyance of commercials and tv edits, this movie totally blew me away right from the beginning.

For those unfamiliar with this movie, the basic gist of it is this:  The movie focus's on a local L.A. suburban scientist named Dr. Lawrence Angelo(Pierce Brosnan,  The Matador, Golden Eye, Mrs. Doubtfire) of whom is stressed out but hopeful about using Virtual Reality(VR) for positive use, in particular, as a means of stimulating the human mind as well as being a groundbreaking way of making a human being smarter.  Dr. Angelo has his neighbors, a friendly young kid named Peter Parkette, his beautiful mother Carla, and the local landscaper/repairman, Jobe Smith(Jeff Fahey, Psycho 3, White Hunter, Black Heart, Darkman 3).  After a highly unfortunate incident with the lab chimp, Roscoe, Dr. Angelo seeks out a new test subject for his experiments.  He finds that mentally challenged Jobe would be a good possible replacement for Roscoe.  Between his fun games and brain teaser and highly educational CR Rom's and VR with a gyroscope, plus a stimulant drug, used both at his home and at The Shop, the place where Dr. Angelo works, Jobe excels heavily as he successfully becomes alot smarter and even surpasses Dr. Angelo's intellect.  Unfortunately, something is going terribly wrong with Jobe as he is out of control and looking to seek revenge against any of the people that have mistreated him or anyone he knows.  Who's behind Jobe's corrupted mind and can Dr. Angelo save him?  Just watch and see.

That covers the basic idea of the plot.

I just love this brilliant Sci-Fi fantasy.  The CGI special effects may not be quite like what we have today, but when this movie came out 25 years ago, this was groundbreaking and such special effects had barely been done before.  I see this movie as being so ahead of its time and so forward-thinking that it came to be a tremendous influence on so many other great and epic sci-fi movies to come.  Such other great Sci-Fi films that soon followed after this were Virtuosity, The Matrix and The Animatrix, Dark Drive, the tv series VR-5 etc.  There's no question how much this movie owes to such awesome classics before it like Logan's Run, Blade Runner, Brain Storm, Total Recall, and of course Tron.

The story while having been done before in the movie Charly, took that idea to an even bigger level still with its use of our ever-growing technology and science involving VR and several educational computer programs.

This movie has so many awesome cutting edge CG images such as the virtual hornets, the molecular deaths, and best of all the coolest and most unique movie villain of the time, CyberJobe.

The musical score by Dan Wyman was beautifully done and very riveting. It covers the whole feel of the movie flawlessly.  The score ranged from tense to mysterious, to peaceful and whatnot.

The cinematography was very beautiful to look at with the sunrise, lovely shots of the suburbs, beautiful shots of green lawns, trees, and hills, and the remarkably shot interior scenes of the diner as well as the exterior shots of the gas station.

Jobe's not too fast and not too slow transitions were remarkably handled as Jobe starts out simple then he starts to become smarter then he becomes highly intellectual then cold, remote, and gaining more and more intelligence and finally power mad and vengeful.

There was a little bit of good nudity along with a couple of sexy scenes.

Jeff Fahey played his role flawlessly to where you could completely believe all of his intellect and personality changes.  Pierce Brosnan was the perfect opponent on the good side of the twisted spectrum that was addressed in the scientific and moralistic side of things.  Pierce's performance fully showed all the stress, concern, and optimistic hopes that Dr. Angelo had for his research and experiments.

Overall, this movie was and always will be a huge stroke of brilliance and creativity.  If you like science fiction, are into virtual reality how it was thought of back then or what it has become as vr has made a recent comeback, great special effects that were groundbreaking at the time of this movie and are still fascinating even now, a relatable main character that you feel some sympathy for, a cool and unique villain, seeing attractive people, nudity, and lots of exciting tension then this movie is one you gotta check out.  My only complaint is that there has yet to be a Blu-Ray release of this movie plus one for part 2. After 25 years since this movie came out, it still holds up perfectly and there are so few movies like this one so it's also a unique diamond in the rough given that.  I wish that they would get on that soon.  A MUST SEE!!!  10 stars out of 10!",1488412800,7,4925,4.676334106728539

475160,3,6302483395,"Lawnmower Man 1 was about mankind using tech to become a transhumanistic god. Lawnmower Man 2 was about that very same man becoming The Anti-Christ/Image Of The Beast/Lucifer and all of mankind becoming one consciousness in the technological singularity. Both movies were basically foreshadowing Lucifer's game plan for the human race 20+ years in advance. The script was demonically inspired/mused into a screen-writer, taking it far beyond Stephen King's original demonically inspired idea of a Satyr sacrificing to god Pan. Happens all the time! They were basically R-rated versions of the Book Of Revelation to some extent with Jobe being the Anti-Christ and building The New Jerusalem in Cyberspace. Heck! Even ""New World Order"" is mentioned. But the one thing the two movies didn't take into account was mankind's DNA being modified with Bio-Tech. The convergence of man and machine to our very genetic core, straight to the brain no glasses required, which is the ultimate goal. That's the 666 Mark.",1436313600,,1006,5.254658385093168
475161,4,6302483395,"It  bothers  me  just  a  little  bit  how  everyone  treats  him,  He  was  born  dumb.  That's  not  his  fault.  I  mean  we're  all  different.  Jobe's  most  talented  gift  is  mechanical  work  on  weed eaters,  even  chainsaws  &  his  own  mower.  He  helps  his  uncle  Terry  with  the  landscaping.
Terry  &  Peter  appears  to  be  Jobe's  only  friends.  Jobe's  father  the  preacher  wants  what's  best  for  his  son,  but  doesn't  treat  him  right  &  whips  his  back  with  a  belt.  When  the  chimp  is  killed  by  the  military  personnel  guys  Larry Angelo  (Pierce Brosnon)  sees  his  chance  to  help  the  scientific  people  with  their  projects  where  he  works. He  talks  Jobe  into  playing  a  game  in  his  lab  at  home.  &  helps  Jobe  become  smarter.  So  that  people  will  not  take  advantage  of  him  anymore.  Jobe  does  become  smarter  alright.  &  soon  has  got  himself  a  girlfriend.  His  mind  keeps  expanding  as  well  as  his  desire  to  become  even  smarter.  Even  Doctor  Angelo  is  impressed!  Jobe  learns  to  stand  his  ground  against  bullies  &  it  doesn't  take  long  for  him  to  get  past  all  of  that.  So  Angelo  takes  Jobe  to  the  main  lab  owned  by  the  government  agents  who  keep  what  they  do  classified.  &  follow  up  on  Doctor  Angelo's  progress.  Jobe  insists  to  continue  regardless  of  some  of  his  seizers,  When  Tim's  that  guy  at  that  private  base  switches  out  the  drugs  it  changes  Jobe.  &  Soon  Jobe  is  defying  Angelo's  warnings  &  his  guidance  &  learning  to  control  peoples  ways  of  thinking,  their  brains,  him  changing  the  police  officers  ways  of  thinking.  First  off  they  say  2  Bizarre  murders  in  one  night,  then  suddenly  they  just  say-(Well  accidents  happen.  That's  all  there  is  to  it)  Accidents  says  Angelo?  You  were  just  calling  them  murders?  &  Jobe  taking  away  Caroline's  who's  Angelo's  wife,  normal  life  away  to  where  she's  possessed  &  cannot  be  freed  from  Jobe's  power. &  can  destroy  people  by  making  their  bodies  divide  apart  until  they  become  nothing  more  then  thin  air.  Its  like  a  computerized  puzzle  that's  got  a  100  pieces  or  more  coming  apart.
Its  funny  stuff  like  that,  because  that's  what  I  like  about  this  movie!  It  is  far  beyond  ordinary!  &  Jobe  creating  a  computerized  colony  of  Yellow jackets  or  wasps  to  fight  the  guards  at  the  entrance  to  the  private  base. That's  what  I  like  best  about  the  movie  (Jeff Fahey)  is  brilliant!  Its  not  only  a  science  fiction  like  movie  but  weird!
Angelo  knows  he  must  stop  Jobe  before  he  does  anymore  damage  to  himself  or  to  human  society.
So  he  finds  him.  But  Jobe  has  automatically  transformed  into  a  computer  like  freak.  I  don't  know  what  to  call  him  exactly.  But  its  like  nothing  I've  ever  seen  before.  So  Angelo  plants  bombs  &  tries  to  get  Jobe  to  go  with  him  &  Peter  before  the  building  blows  up.  Even  though  Jobe  never  reentered  his  human  body  he  survived  the  explosion  & wound  up  in  the  phone  systems  instead  of  his  own  body.  That's  why  the  phones  were  ringing.  To  give  Angelo  a  message  that  he  was  okay.  I  do  feel  a  little  bad  for  him  that  Angelo  was  not  able  to  reverse  what  Jobe  was  going  through  to  prevent  him  from  becoming  too  psychotic.
 Not  only  did  he  learn  to  be  a  man,  he  got  in  to  the  project  too  deep.  &  should  have  considered  Angelo's  heeds  &  learn  only  at  a  steady  pace  under  Angelo's  wisdom.
There  definitely  things  like  this  in  real  life  to  where  you  can  get  smarter.  At  least  you  do  not  have  to  worry  about  brain  trauma  or  damage.
I  find  this  one  a  very  interesting  movie.  I  still  got  it  on  V.H.S
Its  not  much  as  far  as  gory  goes  not  much  blood  or  nothing.

Just  terrific  Si Fi  stuff.",1436140800,,4088,4.447409733124019

475164,5,6302483395,"As far as I am concerned this movie is ahead of it's time considering when it originally came out, some 20 odd years ago!  OK, it's not the greatest for the movie purists but it introduced us to the wonderful world of Virtual Reality. The movie is very entertaining with an ending you might see coming.

The story opens with Dr Angelo who is experimenting with a Virtual Reality system and contemplates using this tech to help a neighbor of his. He also works for the government where he has access to a very cool VR lab.

Dr Angelo is the researcher trying to enhance the mind of a neighbor whose is developmentally challenged, Jobe.  He feels this technology can help all people with such challenges some day.  Of course the government feels otherwise. They want the technology to create hordes of supermen! Typical...

The movie depicts the military aspects of VR and touches on the developmental aspects of the technology in the direction of greatly accelerated learning. And of course, beware, there is a sex scene, well, there has to be one of those.

The media comes on a double sided disc - One side has the movie and the other side has all the special effects... very cool.  Anybody who has any interest in the world of Virtual Reality, this movie reveals a wonderful (Sci-Fi) version of what is to come!

The funny thing is I have waited all these years for the promise of VR to become available to the masses (after watching this very movie), and finally IT IS HERE!!!!  It is said that 2015 is the beginning of the Virtual Reality explosion and by 2016 everyone will know what VR is!

Most of the tech depicted in the movie was real then but cost a ton of money at the time.  Headsets for smartphones with VR apps are here now!  I have the iPhone 6+ and am starting out with 120 VR apps and Google Cardboard to whet my appetite before my AirVR+ comes!!!!!!!!  I love technology!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

475184,1,6302483395,"Whenever I see a movie about computers from the '80s and '90s, I have to ask myself, ""Is this what people REALLY thought computers and the Web were like?""

And if there's a movie that can make ""Tron"" look reality-based, it would be ""The Lawnmower Man."" This is one of those ugly footnotes in Pierce Brosnan's career between ""Remington Steele"" and James Bond, and he is completely wasted as a scientist who (not kidding) uses virtual reality to change a person's brain. Even if it weren't a scientific farce, the acting is absurd and the ""serious"" death scenes are hysterical.

Dr. Lawrence Angelo (Brosnan) is developing a chemical/VR combination which can make a person more intelligent, but also possibly more aggressive. Of course, the government wants the process to make supersoldiers. But after his test monkey goes berserk and starts killing people, he decides to secretly continue his experiments from his basement.

His new test subject is Jobe Smith (Jeff Fahey), a mentally-handicapped guy who mows lawns in the neighborhood. And after Angelo begins exposing him to the magic of virtual reality, Jobe's intellect rapidly hits genius levels -- and then he begins showing signs of psychic powers like telekinesis, mind-reading and other fun abilities. But because of a mysterious government agency, Jobe is also becoming more evil.

""The Lawnmower Man"" is a movie based on Hollywood's belief that computers are magic and virtual reality is another DIMENSION. And that is where my suspension of disbelief snaps -- this movie informs us that virtual reality can overcome physical, actual brain defects just by flashing information in the disabled person's face.

And then they become a genius. And a telepath. And a telekinetic. How do you gain the power to control people like puppets, generate giant golden floating heads, and turn people into golf-ball-sized whirling spots around a black hole... from a computer? Yes, this is one of those science-fiction stories that has more fantasy than science, and it actually makes ""Tron"" look like hard gritty reality.

But it's a pretty dreadful movie even on artistic merits. The plot itself feels like ""Flowers for Algernon"" with a cliche sci-fi twist, and the attempts to be horrifying are absolutely hilarious, such as when Jobe uses a supercharged lawnmower to kill someone. It also feels like large chunks of the movie were cut out, since the mysterious ""Shop"" is never really explained and Angelo's wife just sort of evaporates from the movie.

The CGI has also not aged well. The more surrealist parts are actually pretty decent, considering how old the movie is -- but when humanoid CGI figures move and speak, it's terrifying. It brings home just why Pixar took so long to animate humanoid characters in their movies.

It doesn't help that Fahey is absolutely dreadful in this movie -- at first it seems like he's doing a really bad impression of a handicapped person, but he actually gets WORSE when Jobe becomes smart. Pierce Brosnan is clearly just phoning in it, possibly because his character is so utterly unsympathetic -- he swings between being a jerk and being a blah non-hero.

""The Lawnmower Man"" is one of those movies that hasn't aged well, and is probably best appreciated through a pair of thick nostalgia goggles. Otherwise, the silly premise and absurd execution just make it a chore.",1369958400,,3363,5.023339317773788

The reason is because of the director ""Brett Leonard"" himself.  I saw him doing a review of the film and he stated that he never wanted all that extra material to be release.  According to Mr. Leonard it made the film to long and boring to many people.

The problem is that the 108 minute version of the story looks as if things have been removed.  When I saw this film at the theaters in 1991 I was lost on what the story was trying to convey.  Then I rented the 141 minute version and it all fit together so I bought a use version of the VHS copy.

Yet, VHS will rare out and so will the machine that I play it own.  I do not understand why it is just a problem to release the Director's Cut onto DVD.  Everyone well make more money than it would cost to put it together and it would please a lot of customers.

Look what Steven Spielberg did in November 2007.  He re-released the original 1977 version of ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" with the other two versions on three separate DVD's.  Then in December of 2007, Ridley Scott released the original version of ""Blade Runner"" with 4 different versions on five DVD's.

All Mr. Leonard has to do is release both both version on DVD or just the Director's Cut version and the customers will be content.

If you have not seen the Director's Cut then please do and if you enjoy it enough please write your own email.  Fan's email does have an effect.

475227,2,6302483395,"I don't understand why producers, film-makers, and directors feel it so necessary to cut away scenes from movies all the time, in order to shorten or make the film more acceptably ""compact"" or whatever. The first time I saw Lawnmower Man on DVD, in 2001, the cut version, that was the very first time I ever saw the movie, in general. And when I saw it, it seemed INCOMPLETE, INCOHERENT, AND CONFUSING. In many ways. Scenes that seemed to appear out of no where.  Monkeys running like that? How? Why? From what? That woman in the house opening the door?? What the hell was that about?????
Ok, well THEN I saw alll the ""deleted scenes"" that the DVD option had. And I was like, WHY THE &%*$ did those dope-head producers in the studio cut out scenes from Lawnmower Man that were OBVIOUSLY needed to make the freakin movie make total sense???? In the original theatrical release too or whatever. Why do these editors take such insane liberties in just chopping away at scenes that they stupidly THINK are not needed. Length? I'd rather a movie be sorta long-ish and be cool, interesting, co-herent, and make more total sense than there be a shortened movie that makes very little sense, and has confusing parts, and with obvious holes in it. I mean, it's a SHAME, because the special effects are good in Lawnmower Man in ANY year, 1992, or 2008, despite what narrow-minded reviewers on here have said about that. The graphics and visual details and computer effects are impressive and even dazzling in some moments.  In any year.  And the concepts are interesting in the movie. So why ruin it, by retardedly cutting out good and needed scenes? Stuff like this, in a way, was done in the movie ""A Beautiful Mind"" too, with Russell Crow. As another example. GREAT SCENES THAT COULD HAVE AND SHOUULD HAVE BEEN LEFT IN, WERE DOGMATICALLY AND ANNOYINGLY TAKEN OUT. It seems that cutting out scenes from movies, for the ""final cut"", is done GRATUITOUSLY many times, by directors, cuz it's ""the thing to do"". Duhhh. I hear from other reviews on here that the VHS version had all the deleted scenes already inter-woven inside the movie itself, correctly and nicely, for a 140-minute movie, instead of a 108 minute movie. Again, it seems that in the original theatrical release it was probably about 108 minutes with all those good and essential scenes cut out by moronic producers and whatnot. I mean, SO WHAT if the movie is kinda long-ish. (It's not that long.)  In the uptight minds of the producers or maybe retarded ""test audiences"" or whatever the hell. Movies are not supposed to be a measly 28 or 58 minutes or 74 minutes or whatever. But like a good 2 hours or 2 1/2 hours anyway. More to be entertained by and enjoy and learn from and more material.  So what.  Yeah yeah, many movies are only 90 minutes we know. Cuz apparently it's thought that many people don't have long attention spans or don't wanna sit through something so long maybe. BS! is what I say to that small-minded uptight crap. It depends on the movie. Anyway, I wish the biscuit heads that put this DVD together had the brains by now (it's 2008 now) to make a FULL DIRECTOR'S CUT of this movie. Cuz Lawnmower Man kinda sucks without those many minutes worth of deleted scenes. Good necessary cool scenes.  THE MOVIE DOESN'T MAKE MUCH SENSE WITHOUT THOSE SCENES, PEOPLE !!! It's an ok movie overall, you can tell. But would be a good to great movie if alll the scenes were simply left in.
And there should be an un-cut full DVD version by now. Just like there was an un-cut VHS version. But my point again though is that the producers and decision-makers should have never taken those interesting and important scenes out of the movie TO BEGIN WITH!!  In 1993.  Again, it's not just Lawnmower Man, but many movies' directors have pulled this silly crap over the years. Blindly carelessly neurotically retardedly annoyingly cutting out good and even necessary scenes out of movies, that could make the movies sooo much better if it was just left alone. Instead of the chop job that's many times done.
Don't buy this version Lawnmower Man on DVD. If it's not a good extended director's cut version. Save your money. Cuz the shortened version SUCKS in many ways, and is incoherent and is obviously incomplete. Just the facts.",1209859200,,4288,4.646437994722955

King doesn't even have his name included in the credits of the movie.  On its own, THE LAWNMOWER MAN does have some brilliant computerized effects, especially considering we're only in the early nineties here.  The story focuses on maverick scientist Pierce Brosnan, who has developed a virtual reality program that has mind-boggling possibilities.  Of course, the scientist is being monitored by the sinister ""Shop"", a covert governmental group that has more nefarious schemes for Brosnan's discovery. Brosnan loses his monkey when it goes on a violent rampage, so he takes a hiatus and decides to continue the experiment on a human.  He chooses Jeff Fahey, an illiterate, mentally challenged lawn mower operator as his guinea pig.  Fahey agrees and before long, he has become as brilliant as his mentor, and thanks to some tampering from the Shop, a more malevolent force as well.  It all culminates into a virtual showdown at the end, as Fahey decides he can be a god if he goes into the mainframe of the computer and puts himself out into global interface and then he can control the world.  The ending is a little nebulous, although all the phones ringing at the same time universally would indicate Fahey managed to gain access before the lab was exploded.  This crucial ending is neglected in the sequel, which will be discussed further in a different review.

Of course Kubricks Clockwork Orange is in remembrance , but Leonard does what Kubrick couldn't do - probably due to Burgess novel and the ""impersonal"" story-points of C.O. - by letting us into the evil guy and by understanding his secret of the deepest darkest unhappiness known to man : The Luciferian state .

However , TLM is a different movie than ""Virtuosity"" and battles with ""brighter"" themes !

TLM is from 1992 ; Windows 3.1 was only just announced (Windows 95 didn't exist yet of course :-) and Windows NT was only on BETA-stage ... The wonder-promise of virtual learning , which now is commonly accepted (people ""speedlearn"" from the Internet and softwares on computers) , takes further steps into the future to a threshold we eventually will run into (when we have eliminated spam-mongers and cyber-terrorists !) sooner or later .

And here TLM starts it's ""evil magic"" , not like Fausts choice , but like a two-way-responsibility gone apart between the individual (Fahey) and the society (Brosnan , Slate etc.) resulting in tragedy on both parts . We can learn a lot , but we cannot learn how to unlock our civilized psychological prison as we ARE the prison of our mothers ""milk"" or symbolically in Jobe's case , the aggression-chemical !

Yet I find there are many other themes (in example : the creator and the creation / the mystery of sex and the mind etc.) , this underrated ahead-of-it's-time-movie treats , that is worth paying attention to ; this is a masterpiece in more than one way .

475247,5,6302483395,"My delight in and fascination with this movie revolves around the elements related to accelerated learning - yap, I have a certain obsession with mind-stuff and learning, development of different abilities, so this movie was right up my alley.

The movie involves a scientists who has passion for mental development. His main tools are nootropics (smart drugs) and virtual reality.  His experiments are funded by government which is only interested in creating killers.  The original experiment is conducted on a monkey.  It goes astray when the monkey breaks lose and kills few people.  Though, even this neurologically rewired monkey doesn't kill indiscriminately - he assesses whether the individual he is facing is potentially dangerous or not.  For that matter, one could say, this would work even on the instinctive level of an animal.  This monkey, on the run, stumbles upon a Lawnmower Man - a good-hearted, simple, young man whose mental development has been arrested somewhere around the age of a 5-year old and who just happens to live next door to the scientist's house.

Lawnmower man and the monkey strike instant friendship, however the government agents track down the monkey and shoot him.  Lawnmower is devastated (he has identified the monkey as one of his comic strip characters come to life), and so is the scientist.  But then, the brilliant idea occurs to the scientist, to continue his experiments in private on the Lawnmower man.

He begins infusing him with nootropics and stimulating his mind with virtual reality.  The first images impressed upon his mind, very much in the way subliminal programming is used are the seals from the Solomonic magick.  Different parts of his brain are also neurologically stimulated, following by feeding the man's mind with more information.

This is a sci-fi movie, but the learning process does have some parallels to the methods and techniques used in real life.  There are lots of people who are taking nootropics (smart drugs), albeit in oral form; and subliminal and supraliminal programming - if not yet quite the use of virtual reality - are alive and well.  Those who are familiar with photoreading and different techniques from Neuro-Linguistic Programming, also know that the mind does tend to absorb information better when it is delivered fast, as well as when all of one's senses are engaged in the process (that's the stimulation that virtual reality here provides).

So, the hero of this movie, Lawnmower man, makes extraordinarily rapid progress - together with amassing huge amount of knowledge in record time, absorbing the information mainly subliminally, he also begins to develop different abilities which are normally considered supernatural.  This, as matter of fact, also makes sense, because development of such abilities is based on stimulating and creating new neural connections.  The more he learns, the more hungry for learning he becomes.  There's also the reality that anyone with passion for learning is well aware of.  His ultimate desire is to ""be all"" - yet another element, that those who are involved in spiritual growth are very much into - the ultimate goal of merging with All There Is.  This, being a sci-fi movie, instead of merging with the spirit - our hero merges with the virtual reality - which is a decent metaphor for the spiritual reality / a quantum reality, where everything is made out of mind stuff and through the mind one becomes omnipresent, omnipotent and omniscient.

In vast majority of the movies, it is this ending where the movie flops and this ultimate level of omnipresence, omnipotence and omniscience either for dramatic purposes or due to lack of understanding of those who play with the idea, ends up in feeding individual's ego (that was even worst in Highlander than in this movie), as the one who has become All just won't have any desire to go and kill others - how could he - he IS present in all (even all others) - but for drama needed to make movies exciting this element that one would be all loving at this point, seems as if it would be boring.  In any event, here is where The Lawnmower Man II, flopped - it went into cyber neverland and lost the spirit of the original theme.",1102291200,19,4220,4.953191489361702

I saw it as part of a double feature at a budget theatre and still I felt that I had been ripped off, it was that bad.  I respect Jeff Fahey's talents as an actor, but he should be ashamed to have his name attached to this piece of crap, as should Stephen King (although I guess he really had very little to with this movie's production).

The world would be well-served if all prints of this movie could be destroyed.  Forget weapons of mass destruction --- find the original negatives for this stinker and eliminate them.  We will all be better off.",1095379200,4,644,4.203252032520325

I saw it when it was originally released at the theater. At that time I thought the graphics were great, but it just didn't grab my attention and hold it. I didn't mind going to the lobby for a soda, popcorn, hot dog, nachos, restroom, check out movie posters, make a phone call,... The problem is the story got to wrapped up in the lawnmower mans psyche. That would be okay if it was thought provoking, but it is mostly graphical halucinations and sexual innuendo. Not that illuminating into the characters motivations. One thing stands out in this movie. Some great early CGI.

Instead we are subjected to a made-up story about a guy who just HAPPENS to mow lawns for a living!  So the fact that they marketed this PoS as ""Stephen King's Lawnmower Man"" is a crime of intellectual property, except they didn't steal his ideas.  They stole his name and his story's name and defaced both with a crappy ""Flowers For Algernon"" ripoff.

Shame on every one of you who helps propagate this heinous crime against creativity.  Shame on everyone who equivalates that ""it's still an okay movie"".  OKAY isn't good enough.  If you make a movie called ""Mary Shelley's Frankenstein"", it should damn well have something to do with the book, instead of just being a study of Robert DeNiro slipping around in amniotic fluids.

475251,5,6302483395,"Even if the 12 scenes cannot be played as an extended version there's food for Your brains , hearts and gender here !
This movie does have vague resemblances to Scott's - BladeRunner , but only philosophically .
And the attempts to compare this film with Nelson's - Charly(1968) or Whale's - Frankenstein(1931) is ridiculously superficial , like comparing Coppola's - Godfather(1972) to Polonsky's - Force of Evil(1948) or Lang's - You only live once(1937) !
It is however understandable why critics and audiences in 1992 were repelled by the burning of a priest (!) and fascinated by sex/violence in the cyberspace ... they reacted blindly : ""This is a satanic movie !""
An indication of this , is that Stephen Kings wished/had his credit removed by a following lawsuit ...
I recommend everyone to see it (again) for now 12 years later this brilliant movie still shines as an epic drama of man , freedom and God .
Just remember BladeRunner , which 22 Years ago also grew discarded , cult-reserved and now is number 10 in IMDb Votes Charts Top 50 Sci-Fi movies and number 89 in Top 250 movies !
In the beginning The Lawnmower Man has a parallel to Charly (Daniel Keyes great Novel : Flowers for Algernon) , but mainly Jobe EVOLVES due to a growing thirst for knowledge and possibilities - while Charly IMPROVES himself to be more accepted and feeling equal to others .
While Charly ends tragically sweet , the Lawnmower Man explores in a completely different direction .  What about Frankenstein ?  No , it does not go in this direction either or end like this other great story ; Brett Leonard dares to push his vision much higher :
Jobe sees the totality of the world like God , but has become sad in soul through the interference of the government , religion & society and strikes back to change everything through the available electronic international net ...
That alone should be an eyeopener in these days of spam and morality !
Though the script has really very little to do with King's character nor his shortstory in the shortstory-collection Nightshift , one can hardly blame Leonard without remembering how another instructor expanded and explored Arthur Clarkes shortstory (called ""The sentinel"" on even fewer pages than TLM) and making the amazing movie 2001: A Space Odyssey .
At that time it was criticised as being too long , etc. !
I agree that there are typical movie-clones of Frankenstein and Charly , one is even with Robert DeNiro and Robin Williams called ""Awakenings""(1990) and though I love the two guys this is a 90% Charly-story !  But , then again , nobody dared saying so to Penny Marshall after making ""Big"" cowritten by Spielbergs sister - personally I think Daniel Keyes still could make a lawsuit !
And no critics would minimize Charlie Chaplins Dictator for being a cute rewriting of Duck Soup from the geniuses of the Marx Brothers !
I think this movie deserves respect and You will all find that the reason why You were amazed at the once incredible special effects , were because they fitted so well to the story and characters - a secret that merely few instructors like Spielberg and Hitchcock master .
Therefore judge this movie by the many-layered story of existence .
  I must say thanks to Brett Leonard & Gimel Everett
  for making this neo-myth out of a Stephen King-title",1078099200,5,3317,4.708620689655173
475252,3,6302483395,"I must admit it, I never watched The Lawnmower Man back in 1992. It wasn't untill I read reviews here that I bought it, interested to see what these 'stunning' visual effects are.

  Of course, judging on a 10-year-old movie's visual effects isn't easy. But in my opinion, compared to its time visuals in Jurrasic Park, Terminator 2, Total Recall, etc.. it's nothing.  Perhaps the problem is that there are TOO many visuals that it must have made them concentrate less in each scene.
  The movie itself is only TRYING to do something. I felt that the director was trying to make the movie an icon in Science Fiction like '2001 : A Space Odyssey' and 'Blade Runner' but instead through artificial intelligence, through Virtual Reality.  The movie revolves around the same idea of FRANKESTIEN, except that the cause of the transformation is VIRTUAL REALITY.
  The movie even doesn't explain how virtual reality could achieve what the story is revolving around; increasing brain activity and unlocking humans deep potentials.  All they do is put the person in Virtual Reality and through lots of images on him with a very fast speed, but is this logical?
  As for the DVD itself: the video quality is fine. Of course, it's not comparable to Total Recall which was 2 years before it, but it's fairly good since this movie isn't a huge one to deserve much attention.  The extras on the other side (it's double sided DVD; weird, the movie took 4.16GB on one side and the extras took 1.8GB on the other side) need no further explaination.
  Most notably are the deleted scenes. Most of these scenes aren't extended scenes or scenes which explained more about the story.  They're actually scenes that would've changed the story 180 degrees. Much like the alternate endings on some DVDs, except that some of these scenes provide alternate story...",1026604800,4,1838,4.824281150159744

True some of the cut scenes should have been kept but most are just plain out stupid! when the movie first came out on tape, it was an unrated direcor's cut with all the deleted scenes intact. later when the tape was re-issued, the scenes where cut out. now this dvd is a transfer of that second vhs tape. this dvd still gives the option to view the 12 cut scenes and i am happy about that. you can still see them, just not in the film. i thought most of them ruined the movie anyway. but its stil good to be able to see them separetly. the other special features on this dvd are really great. for a 12 buck dvd, its a great deal! its go the trailer, making of, audio commentary,a music video of the V.R. scenes and the 12 cut scenes. the reason this film didn't do so well in theatres was that it was competing with T2 and thats not easy to do! still this is a wonderful classic for any sci-fi fan. big woop about the 12 missing scenes! they really don't help the movie but if you wanna see them you still can seperately!",1018828800,5,1140,4.116591928251121

475288,4,6302483395,"This film was rejected by Stephen King as his product. Yet it was inspired by Stephen King and we find in it all Stephen King's themes. The central character is a retarded young man. He is submitted to experiments by the Shop, without the doctor responsible for the experimentation being aware of it. His psyche and intellect are improved tremendously and he becomes a genius. But the Shop changes the drug used by the doctor who is a little bit dumb since he does not see the change in colors from blue to red. But, details, details. And Jobe becomes a monster who tries to conquer the world without stooping down but by entering the computer systems of the planet. Then you have a vicious priest who is a torturer, in the name of God of course, like in The Talisman. Then you have a young boy who goes along with the doctor and his mother to destroy the complex where the exprimentation is taking place. But they are too late. Then you have the theme of vengeance, which is, from the point of view of the victim, Jobe himself, justice : he kills the torturing priest, he kills the violent father who has been manhandling Peter, the young boy. He kills the secret service agents who are trying to stop the doctor in his attempt to freeze Jobe's transformation, and also a few other agents of the Shop. This is killing, but once again, from Jobe's point of view, from his victimized point of view it is justice because it sets the clocks back to his time. Justice is nothing absolute, but only something relative, even if we must admit it is more vengeance and revenge than what we would call justice. The only element that is less Kingian is the ending, the bad ending : the monster succeeds. But even that is not impossible in a way. We find such an ending in Pet Semetary, for instance. This film is a great film about the possibilities of virtual reality but also about its dangers, even if the main accent is set on the dangers, after all.

In the case of `The Lawnmower Man', however, I found it to be just  okay... not bad, but nothing spectacular. I watch it more for it's virtual  reality scenes than it's story. Although seeing Jobe (Jeff Fahey) develop  from a simple nitwit to an incredibly intelligent, and dangerous, entity  with deadly psychokinetic abilities was interesting to watch. And his  attempts to enter and control the virtual world make for some of the most  memorable CGI special effects moments since `Tron' and `Terminator 2'. And  with all of the VR scenes, I can see where the Wachowski brothers got one  of their many grains of inspiration for `The Matrix'.
