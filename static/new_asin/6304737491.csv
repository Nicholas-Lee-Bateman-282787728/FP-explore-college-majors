Although the props are great and the music performed superbly,  watching this fiasco is like hearing Marilyn Manson performing with the  Mormon Tabernacle Choir. In an attempt to make  a multicultural rainbow out  of a classic, the absurdity of the effort becomes apparent. In 100 years,  college professors will make this a ""must see"" for those studying  ""deviant cultural trends of the 20th century"". Buy it for study,  but not for entertainment.",924307200,7,604,5.154639175257732

923062,5,6304737491,"I remember watching this movie as a little girl. My mother did not mind but my father did for all the reasons you can think of. But I have to say I never really noticed it. I was actually shocked when someone pointed out to me that they were not all white. I was like ""Really? Huh i never noticed."" IT never really mattered to me. I loved everything about it and don't understand how the reviews could be so horrible. The story is pure magic. Isn't that what it is about? Seeing the magic in life. And i have to say everyone was so great at their roles. It showcased what they are great at, besides singing. Their emotions just leap from the screen. I am still moved over 15 years later and cant wait to go home and watch this movie with my mom. I know almost every single work and I can keep up with all the songs. The cast and crew should be proud of the work they did. It inspires all to be blind to things that don't matter like skin color and to take people for what they are worth. I do have to say that I might talk like that and believe in it but I too have trouble acting like that. I think that is the worse trait to me and that's saying something. but I just want to say thank you to everyone who was involved with this wonderful production. You have inspired many things in my life including my lovely wedding gown!!!!Don't give up the dream!!!!!!",1352419200,,1359,4.112781954887218
923063,4,6304737491,"Loved this movie when it first aired as a television special. The creativity of the sets and costume design only enrich the music and story of this version of Cinderella. I was so happy to finally get a copy on DVD. The only bad thing is that the special features are very limited and the aspect ratio of the image is small for my television. I hope that they update this movie and transfer it to Blu-Ray with some additional features and a better picture quality. The computer animated graphics do age this movie, but it doesn't take too much away from the beauty and enjoyment of this wonderfully made production.",1334534400,,615,4.54954954954955

923066,5,6304737491,"I watched this in a foreign country and came to realize exactly how much the world has changed since the date of it's airing. Beside it appearing on television in my childhood (which makes me nostalgic enough), the songs are indeed catchy and the multicultural cast can at least pull off the gig.

Yes, it wasn't perfect. Yes, it was overdone in a lot of ways. However, I think it embodies a lot of the spirit of the late 1990s and the pre 9/11 world.

Look at what's on TV now, and compare, and THEN complain.",1104969600,3,510,4.302083333333333
923067,5,6304737491,"I never thought there'd be a better Cinderella movie done after the 1960's version with Leslie Anne Warren: That was the movie I loved as a little girl, and that's the one I thought they should have stopped with.  But then, this new version came along... What a delight! Suprisingly, though... I was amazed to read the Amazon.com review which totally panned it! Goes to show you should NEVER judge something until you experience it for yourself!  My two young BOYS even loved this video when we first saw it... (ages 6 & 8 at the time;) they loved the humor in it and the great songs! The colorful sets and the wonderfully animated characters are all cast as a whole just perfectly. The white dad, black mom, and asian son was never even questioned by my kids... which is another aspect of this film that makes it so special.  A five star in this mom's book... something the whole family can watch together from Grandparents all the way down to the toddlers! I'm off to buy the dvd (our VHS tape version is getting worn!) for our permanent collection.",1096934400,5,1051,4.521052631578947
923162,5,6304737491,"I found this movie delightful - I think I caught it on TV the first time I saw it. I sat through all the commercial breaks to watch the whole thing and that's saying something. I love how eclectic the cast is. It's refreshing to see a completely multicultural cast as well. The Queen and King were wonderfully played. The stepmother was perfectly cruel. The stepsisters were laughably brainless. The prince never seems to get enough credit in any of the reviews I've seen - he sings quite well; I thought he was a pretty good actor and he meshes well with his ""parents"". The songs are mostly well performed (I'm not sure what kind of crack the fairy godmother was smoking though). All in all, it's worth picking up and adding to your DVD collection.",1093737600,2,749,4.514705882352941

923164,5,6304737491,"This wonderful remake of the 1954 and 1965 version is the best yet. I fell in love with this movie the first time I watched it. The colors of the costumes and sets are brilliant and alive. Bernadette Peters brings a personality to the step mother, instead of only portraying her as the villian, she seems like a human. Brandy did an amazing job acting as Cinderella, and swept the viewers off of their seat for a second time once she began to sing. When Whitney Houston entered the story, the whole scene picked up. She was portrayed as a fairy godmother but the golden glittery spin on her character made her seem more like a goddess. Paolo Montalban did a breathtaking job as the prince, setting his character as an empathetic prince who is simply looking to be like everyone else. Natalie Dessette and Veanne Cox portrayed the two hillariously perfect step-sisters. They gave the two girls a breath of pity for Cinderella which made the audience love their personalities even more.
  The multi-ethnic cast and the new songs added in were brilliant, giving it just the perfect touch of reality and zing. This was over all a fabulous film, one that you could easily sit and watch...over and over and over again.",1041120000,5,1212,4.658878504672897
923165,4,6304737491,"CINDERELLA was executive produced by Whitney Houston (The Preachers Wife, The Bodyguard) and is the retelling of the Roger's and Hamersteins's version of the Brothers Grimm story of the young madden who wanted more out of her life. Originally produced for television with Julie Andrews (The Sound Of Music, Mary Poppins ) in the lead and then reproduced in the 60's with Leslie Ann Warren in this production - this version for the 90's has Brandy Norwood (Moesha, Hercules -YV ) in the lead. Directed by Robert Iscove (Miami Vice, The Flash TV) the film has a very high production value and visual style to it.
Whitney herself plays the Fairy Grandmother. (Originally she wanted to play Cinderella herself, but someone got smart and talked out of it. She is a little old!) This film stays true to the original play and what's even better is the costumes, sets and talents of the technology make this a lavishly looking production, costumes and even special effects.
There are a few standout performances by the two stepsisters - played by Veanne Cox (Eric Brochovich, You've Got Mail) and Natalie Desselle (Set It Off, For Your Love)have great comic timing and voices. But the standout singer in this is the evil stepmother played by the incomparable Bernadette Peters (Silent Movie, Annie) who is exciting and enchanting to watch.
New to this scene is actor/singer Paulo Maltebaun ( Mortal Kombat - TV, The Great Raid) making his debut from the stage to the small screen. He is interesting, and intriguing, and had a great voice. He is a natural opposite Brandy's Cinderella. Brandy gives it a fair shot and she seems innocent enough to make it work.
The music is updated and contemporary and has a lot of flair to it. It looks great and the DVD extra's include a trailer and a behind the scenes look at the production, casting and recording of the project. I liked this movie (originally made for the Disney Channel Premiere on the ABC network) and you will too. It's got humor, lots of music and special effects and it's good for the whole family.

923166,4,6304737491,"Whitney Houston as Cinderella's fairy godmother? Whoopi Goldberg as queen? Needless to say, that's quite a different cast than was in the original Cinderella! And the differences don't stop there. In this 1997 remake of the common fairytale, romance and zaniness freely combine to make this ""Cinderella"" version like any other.
One thing that I loved about this movie was the blending of the old and new. The Rogers and Hammerstein songs written for this movie were still on this movie (bravo to Disney for including them!!), but they were sung by Brandy, a ""Cinderella"" whose pretty ""pop"" voice gives them a modern twist. The stepsisters just can't get much funnier, and their outrageous ballgowns and ballroom blunders will leave you in stitches. Humor also comes in the form of the king and queen-their subtle one-liners will also make you laugh. A subtle yet wonderful new addition to this movie is the varied cast-creating a fairy tale world of every skin color.
The producers of this movie also knew what NOT to change. The prince as every bit as charming as a fairytale should be, and of course the glass slipper is present...and even the slight stiffness of Brandy's acting is forgivable doesn't spoil this otherwise wonderfully done fairy tale.",1027209600,22,1253,4.9714285714285715

923168,5,6304737491,I really enjoyed this version of Cinderella.  I love all of the actors voices.  I also really liked the fact that there were no color lines as far as casting and who was paired with what role...,1015718400,,194,4.216216216216216
923169,4,6304737491,"My 3 year old daughter is in love with this video.  She knows the words to the songs as well as the actors lines.  She can identify with the characters (especially Cinderella) and when she sees other versions of the book or the video she says that they are not the real Cinderella.  I am concerned about positive images for her self esteem and this video has served the purpose of introducing her to some of those images.
The cast of characters is made up of a great mixture of races which displays the diversity that I want my daugter to be comfortable with.  My concern is the absence of African American Males in the video.  There is not one except for the extras in any significant roles.  Unfortunately, I cannot find everything that I am looking for in one video but again the presentation of those in the video is done well.",1013904000,4,831,4.398692810457517
923170,4,6304737491,"Frankly, I'm surprrised at how much effort this was put in this made-for-TV version of the hit Disney animated classic. A multiracial cast was set, casting Bernadette Peters as the deliciously nasty stepmother, a lovely Brandy Norwood as Cinderella and Victor Garber and Whoopi Goldberg as the king and queen.
The movie is uniquely done, lavishly done, fine songs and chereography. The movie itself is a work of love, but it'll never compare to the glitzy, emotion-driven musical power of ""Moulin Rouge."" But the movie is special in its own way.
Give it a look, it's a special musical.",1013817600,2,585,4.91919191919192

I would highly recomend ""Rodger and Hammerstein's Cinderella"", a wonderful musical version of the classic Disney film. With such a convincing cast, the film may seem like reality , despite its fantasy setting. Brandy leads the beautiful film, along with other well-known actors such as Jason Alexander, Whoopie Goldberg, Whitney Houston, Victor Garber, and newcomer Paolo Montalban. I recently  bought Cinderella after seeing it on television, and it instantly became a family favorite. Buy ""Rodger and Hammerstein's Cinderella"" as soon as possible, and believe me, you won't regret it.",1009152000,,684,5.452830188679245

This version of ""Cinderella"" the Cast is wonderful and ""color- bind."" I don't know another movie like it. Where else can you see an African-American Cinderella played by singer/actress Brandy, an Asian Prince played by Paolo Montalban, and the wicked stepmother played by Burnedette Peters. There are so many wonderful cast members it is impossible to list them all.
This story is retold in a modernized, fun, uplifting musical style. Important lessons can be learned from this movie, and your kids will love it!
I also enjoyed the featurette included on the DVD.",1006300800,4,693,5.034782608695652
923263,5,6304737491,"This movie floats like a rainbow in the sky sprinkled with fairy dust. It is the most visually stunning, spectacular feast for the eyes I have ever seen. The messages are wonderful and wholesome, the plot perfect and the singing...magical. I can't find one single thing wrong with this movie.

Brandy brings a sweet innocence to Cinderella, and in my mind, she is the most beautiful Cinderella ever. Her voice lacks a certain maturity, which was perfect for the role. It breathes innocence and a human spirit into Cinderella like never before. She is sweet, mysterious and very feminine. She presents women in a very positive way.

When Cinderella and the Prince meet in the market, you just can't imagine it happened any other way. Paolo Montalban: wow...he is the perfect prince and so handsome. I was so impressed with his voice. When Brandy and Paolo sang together it gave me shivers and one time almost made me cry. It was like two souls mingling in the sky with longing. The choreography was stunningly original. The scenes in the market with all the food will just delight every cook.

The story starts in a market with Cinderella and her two sisters shopping. She meets the Prince, and is then told not to talk to him and is whisked home. Almost immediately, plans are being made for a Royal Ball to find the prince a wife so he can produce an heir for the kingdom. Whoopi Goldberg is hilarious as the Queen, and Victor Garber comes across as a loving father who wants the best for his son. I was amazed when the King and Queen were actually in love, which was not the case in other movies.

As in all the Cinderella stories, Cinderella is left at home and then when she wishes to go to the Ball, the fairy godmother magically appears.

Whitney Houston plays a fairy godmother just as you would imagine her to be, ethereally floating next to the horses and carriage, sparkling, singing...wow, what more could you ask for. It was amazing. Then, the humor was also there as she tries at first to turn the pumpkin into a carriage and fails on the first try. She mumbles something about how she should be able to do this after 600 years of practice. What she does with a pumpkin, well...baby, get ready. This woman can cook! She turns the pumpkin into the most stunning carriage. The pastel blue dress Brandy wears is simply gorgeous.

When Cinderella arrives at the ball, her sisters have already had their chance to um, impress the prince and have failed. The costumes and sets are so incredibly gorgeous and the ballroom dancing almost makes you dizzy because they keep spinning and spinning and spinning. There is a scene at the ball that will make you laugh out loud when her sister is on the staircase. Oh, my that was funny.

Cinderella of course makes it to the end of the stairs at midnight as her beautiful gown changes back to her regular clothes and she loses her glass slipper. When she gets home, more fun awaits. Her sisters are very suspicious of how much she knows about the ball. One of the funny things is that Bernadette Peters looks younger than one of her daughters, but still manages to pull off the step mother act with great flair. We cannot say the same for her daughters. They are quite funny and bumbling, just as we want them to be.

When Cinderealla's stepmother says something about remembering to hide flaws until after the wedding, Cinderella comments as to how a man should love a woman for who she is. A great message to women who sometimes try to be all things to men and fail to find true happiness in being just who they are.

I've always adored the story of Cinderella, and the fact that in this adaptation Cinderella is African American was delightful. Anyone who says Brandy can't act is really lying. She brings a wonderful spirit to this movie and does a wonderful job, she is a much better actor than eighty percent of the actors in movies today. The warmth she pours into this story is so needed in our world today.

I am literally SHOCKED at the poor reviews this movie has received. I have never seen anything this beautiful and heartwarming in my life! This is now my favorite version of Cinderella besides Ever After, which also makes Cinderella so much more human. They are both on my list of favorite movies.

The message of having a wish and then making it come true shows that everything starts with a wish. This message of hope and eternal optimism is so needed in society today. The multicultural actors added so much to the story; and it sends a wonderful message.

You will totally fall in love with this movie!

923264,4,6304737491,"I found this production to be most enjoyable.  There are some weaknesses in individual cast members, but the multi-racial casting is an unusual touch that works quite well.  The sets and costumes are whimsical in true fairy tale fashion and you can't lose with a Rogers and Hammerstein score.
Still, the real news here is Paolo Montalban - an acting, singing, powerhouse with an on camera presence that steals every scene he's in.  In time, I believe, the introduction of Paolo to the viewing public is what this production will be famous for.",998438400,2,543,4.817204301075269

I've always loved the story of Cinderella, and I think the fact that in this adaptation Cinderella was African American was great.  It provides the fantasy for little girls who could relate but not necesarrily identify with previous Cinderellas.
I think the role of the Fairy God Mother was tailor made for Whitney Houston.  While she's not a talented actress, she was able to let her own spunk shine in this role.  It was also a showcase of her undeniable vocal talents.
Jason Alexander's comedic talents were ever present in his role as Lionel.  Bernadette Peters made a superb step mother, even if she wasn't vile and evil.  The step sisters were a comic treat.  Whoopi Goldberg was great as the worrysome queen.  It was evident that she only wanted to see her son happy even if it meant she had to interfere.
Mr. Montaban showcased his talent as the prince.  Brandy's ever maturing vocal ablilities were displayed in this movie, especially when she was able to sing right along with Whitney.  Not only can she sing, but Brandy is quite the actress.

923392,4,6304737491,"If you were ever bored by the flighty tale of that little cinder girl, here's your chance to catch up.  Whitney Houston's eliminated the majestic  castles, tight-lipped step-sisters, and fairy *grand*mothers and replaced  them with flashy decor, bold splashes of color, and a sister with an  attitude.  This latest installment offers the same old story of a  mistreated ""country bumpkin"" who finds redemption in the arms of a prince,  but this retelling's got a touch of soul thanks largely to the  unconventional cast and art direction.  Loyalists to this previous R&H  effort may cry foul after this showy rendition of the musical, but it's a  refreshing effort.  The story returns to its fairy tale roots and youthful  fanbase by providing a healthy dose of cartoony action and emotions.  With  its exaggerated sets and costumes, there's nothing to traumatize the kids  either.
The cast, with its impressive combined stage experience, brings  the production to life.  Bernadette Peters and Jason Alexander lead the way  as the evil stepmother and haggled royal servant.  Peters plays her role to  perfection adding humor to a typically callous character.  The king and  queen are also given a lighthearted makeover by Whoopi Goldberg and Victor  Garber.  Veanna Cox, playing the lanky step-sister, also leaves a memorable  impression.  The movie's most satisfying performance, however, belongs to  Paolo Montalban as the handsome Prince Charming.  He has the right mix of  innocence and rebelliousness, and the guy can sing.  The only casting  blunder was in the main role.  Brandy, as Cinderella, is competent at best  with little acting ability to boot.  Her breathy R&B voice never fills  the energetic Broadway tunes, and she's no competition for her  predecessors, Julie Andrews and Leslie Ann Warren.  Brandy does give  Cinderella some modern spunk and attitude, but she never becomes the  remarkable yet tragically wronged heroine.
While the movie prides itself  on multicultural casting, it offers little in the way of real racial  breakthrough as the cast is primarily black or white, minus Montalban's  Asian prince.  It's a start, nevertheless, and impressionable kids will  take notice.  Aside from Brandy's paltry performance, this very bright and  energetic retelling introduces a pleasingly different approach to the dusty  classic.",967075200,4,2350,5.34435261707989

Here's probably a twist though--out of all the  characters in this newer version, enjoyed Bernadette Peters the most.  She  was outstanding as the evil step mother!  The ingenious pairing of the two  step sisters (one black, one white) was also a good match and also Whoopi  Goldberg as the queen.  Excellent performance in both singing and acting  from the prince.",964742400,6,529,5.190476190476191

Jason Alexander as the royal  aid was also awful.  The man is funny, but he can't sing.  This is a  MUSICAL.  It comes across as not funny and not musical.
Too many of the  songs don't carry the action, they STOP it.
When Whitney (Fairy God  Mother) comes on (42 minutes into it), it does get a lot better.  She is  very good.  But it's just too far into this mess to make it enjoyable.  Rent it.  Don't buy it.

923395,2,6304737491,"Huh? B. Peters as the step mom? Goldberg as the queen?  Didn't they switch those two.  Bernanette is much too pretty to be the step mom, while Whoopy would be perfect (if she could act mean).
Jason Alexander as the royal  aid was also awful.  The man is funny, but he can't sing.  This is a  MUSICAL.  It comes across as not funny and not musical.
Too many of the  songs don't carry the action, they STOP it.

Such a beautiful set, beautiful costumes and  wonderful directing.  Great casting too.  Whoopi Goldberg is priceless as  the Queen and her treatment of Lionel.  The stepsisters are truly  disrespectful of each other and Cinderella.  Bernadette Peters has her  usual wonderful, overblown quality.
How can you beat a movie where one of  the sisters has a shoe fight by holding the glass slipper over her head to  keep it away from the shorter man?
Whitney Houston is inconsequential  in this movie.  Oh well, the rest of the cast is superb, yes, even Brandy.",958003200,,730,4.829268292682927
923397,5,6304737491,"I didn't pay much attention to this made-for-TV movie when it first aired in '97. Now is a different story... I needed to write a paper about the Cinderella motif in films and I happen to pick this movie. I totally fell  in love with Prince Christopher! I couldn't take my eyes off him throughout  the movie... instead of writing about camera angles and mise en scene, I  was drooling over the Filipino prince!  Uh, in short I really like the film  not just of the handsome prince charming but because of the singing talent  present in the movie. I have to admit though, Brandy could use some voice  lessons... she was too breathy! (I can't help it! I'm a singer! ) I want  to know if the soundtrack is available. I totally love the lyrics  (especially the duets) and I've been searching for it here at amazon but  could not find it!",957484800,4,833,4.38562091503268
923398,4,6304737491,"I have not seen the original Rodgers and Hammersteins versions, and so I can't compare this with them. I wasn't all that looking forward to watching it, but when I finally did, I thought it was wonderful. The casting is  terrific, the singing is heavenly, the costumes and sets are gorgeous, the  chereography could NOT have been better and the script itself was amusing.  Brandy makes a really good Cinderella, although she is not the star of the  show by far. Whoopi Goldberg was a really amusing Queen, and Victor Garber  made a terrific King. Whitney Huston was a really cool Fairy God Mother,  but she certainly didn't steal the show, as much as she thought she would.  The step sisters were hillarious too. But Bernadette Peters as the Step  Mother and Paolo M. as the Prince are the ones who stole the show. Paolo  has such a gorgeous singing voice and extremely good looks. He IS as  charming as a prince could EVER be. I thought the songs were splendid, and  I really liked 'Falling in Love with Love' which was an addition, sung by  the step mother and the step sisters. I don't much care for the finale  'There's Music In You', which was written just because Whitney Huston  wanted to do a solo. The Stepsisters Lament is superb, and 'Do I Love You  Because Your Beautiful' is so romantic.  Overrall, this movie has  everything a family entertainment film needs : romance, enchantment,  humour, a good pace and a terrific score too. I liked the way Disney gave  it a modern twist, and how they gave each character a developed  personality, although Jason A. as the Prince's Valet is really annoying.  A  must see for all Cinderella/Rodgers and Hammersteins/Musical/Family  Entertainment/Disney fans!",953424000,10,1710,4.761092150170649

There are so many biracial families in America today, and now there is FINALLY a biracial fairy tale! It's about time! Brandy is superb  in her role as Cinderella! Not only can she sing, but she is a great  actress as well! This is definitely worth watching!",951955200,5,340,4.557377049180328
923500,4,6304737491,"A truly delightful and amazing retelling of the classic tale. Brandy turns in a fine performance as the truly sympathatic heroine. Special kudos must be given to Bernadette Peters as the 'evil' (selfish and insensitive is  more like it) Stepmother, Cinderella's two stepsisters who provided the  comic moments, as well as Whoppi Goldberg as the over-the-top queen. The  scores and songs featured are truly exceptional and well done, especially  the duet between Cinderella and the Prince in the market, and Cinderella's  song about pretending to be someone else. The songs tugs at your  heartstrings and at times, comical (i.e especially those sung by the  stepsisters who are more bumbling inept fools rather than evil - after all,  this is family entertainment! ) With great special effects, this superb  production has done justice to the timeless tale and then some!  The show  has even managed to enchant my restless 4 year old niece who has watched  the show more than 5 times!  ""Impossible! "" she even knows how  to sing the Whitney Houston number! My only complain is that the  power-that-be did not release a soundtrack to this show!  Highly  recommended!",951782400,2,1164,5.042105263157895
923501,5,6304737491,Entrancing - I have already viewed it four times. Brandy's Cinderella is a shear delight and Whitney Houston is grand as the fairy godmother. The supporting cast is excellent. My only criticism is that the choreography of  the big dance scene is slightly clumsy. A wonderful film - I'm going to  view it again.,947721600,3,310,4.722222222222222
923502,5,6304737491,"I have become captivated by this version of Cinderella.  Never have the songs sounded better.  Not only do my children love to watch it, but my husband and I find it to be Broadway quality.  I only wish I could find the  soundtrack, because the arrangements are that GOOD!  Leave it to Disney to  consider all the details.  The costumes and sets are as magical as the  story.  This story is well worth the time of the young and the young at  heart.",946944000,,448,4.289156626506024
923503,4,6304737491,"Although I have never seen the origional, this Cinderella remake blew me away.  With so many recognizable faces, and some really fantastic singers like Whitney Houston and Brandy, this musical is one of the best I have  seen.  Woopie Goldburg plays a part that you would never imagine her in,  and plays it well.  Whitney Houston is the best fairy godmother I have  seen, and the step mother and sisters play an important part in the movie  too.  If you haven't seen it already, I sugest that you see it ASAP!",946425600,,509,4.516483516483516
923504,5,6304737491,"In spite of a few minor flaws, Whitney Houston's CINDERELLA is a fabulous production which should be enjoyed by many for years to come.  I did not like the addition of the electric bass guitar sound to the song In My Own  Little Corner. It sounded like Rodgers and Hammerstein songs as played by  Bootsy Collins (bass player for James Brown and George Clinton).  I agreed  with those who thought that Brandy's voice was not suited for singing  Rodgers and Hammerstein.  But her acting and charisma made up for it.  I  think Brandy was a great choice for the Cinderella.  Whitney Houston may  have tried to dominate a little to much, but since it's her production, it  is her right.  The other cast members were wonderful, especially Natalie  Desselle, Bernadette Peters and Paulo Montalban.  I believe the  inter-racial casting was inspired.  Operas have been using inter-racial  casting for years so this should not be a problem. It would be interesting  to see if the ethnicity of the other customers was a factor in their rating  of this production.  At the risk of inciting racial tension, it seems that  some white viewers may be inclined to give this production a low rating and  may be close-minded to the idea of a multi-racial cast.  If Lawrence  Olivier can play Othello and if Elizabeth Taylor can play Cleopatra, and if  Yul Brynner can play the king of Siam, then Brandy can play Cinderella.  Whitney Houston's CINDERELLA proves to children of all backgrounds that the  color of a person's skin does not matter.  I believe it is time for  CINDERELLA  to be rated with the other R and H masterpieces such as SOUTH  PACIFIC, THE SOUND OF MUSIC, OKLAHOMA, THE KING AND I and CAROUSEL. With  it's great performances, stunning sets, and an updated musical score, I  highly recommend Whitney Houston's CINDERELLA for anyone's video  collection.",945561600,7,1851,4.823717948717949
923505,5,6304737491,"I grew up loving the Leslie Anne Warren version of Cinderella, but watching it as an adult has always been somewhat painful. The sets are very cheap looking, some of the choreography is downright hideous (the men  kicking the women in the butts with their knees during ""The Prince is  having a Ball"") and the dialogue is banal. All that's left that still  gives me great pleasure is the beautiful R&H score. So, I was intrigued  to see what a '90's version would be like, and I was not disappointed.  Brandy and Paolo are totally charming in their roles. The dialogue, while  still not Ibsen, is a vast improvement on the '66 version. Whitney gets a  bit too much screen time and Whoopi not enough; and why doesn't Victor  Garber get to sing? He has an incredible voice, for those who remember him  in Sweeney Todd. The highlights: Bernadette Peters, who gives some depth to  her wicked stepmother...the INCREDIBLY colorful sets and costumes, which  look stunning on the DVD...the wonderful  ""spinning-out-of-control"" feeling of ""Ten Minutes  Ago""...a much improved opening using a ""new"" song...and the  very welcome color-blind casting, along with the ""music's in you""  theme to the story (though that song didn't do much for me). Overall, a  welcome return to the old-fashioned Hollywood musical--with a few modern  twists.",941587200,20,1325,4.9771689497716896
923506,5,6304737491,"Just a little note on the comments stating that this version ""was not what R & H had in mind"":
1. Oscar Hammerstein was passionately against racism, (note his song ""Carefully Taught"" in South  Pacific) and I was told by his daughter, Alice, at the premiere that he  would have been overjoyed with this production.
2. Early on in the  process of re-realizing this score, I felt skeptical when I was asked to  tailor the music to the talents of R. & B. recording artists. In the  midst of production, I received correspondence from both the R. & H.  organization, as well as from Mary Rodgers herself (Richard's daughter)  that they were ""ecstatic"" at the updated sound of the score.  ""My hero,"" were her words to me upon being introduced to her.
Imagine my delight at hearing the above, being that I was an AVID R.  & H. fan as a child AND adult. I watched the 1965 version religiously  year after year until it was no longer aired. I feel very privileged to  have had the honor to have been able to tailor this magnificent score to a  new generation of listeners. It was an experience I will not soon forget!",940291200,87,1108,4.430693069306931

923547,4,6304737491,"This version of Cinderella, for me, is by far the best one I've seen.  Whoopi Goldberg steals the show as the prince's mother.  Her singing isn't quite what it was in the  Sister Act movies, but her comedic timing was at  it's best.  With Whitney Houston playing the fairy godmother and Brandy in  the role of Cinderella, their pop-diva sound combined with the rich lyrics  of Rogers and Hammerstein make for a fantastic musical experience.  But the  best performace of all is by none other than the legendary Bernadette  Peters playing the wicked step-mother.  This movie has a splendid musical  cast which makes up for the not so splendid acting by Paolo Montalbon and  others.  All in all, if you are a fan of musicals, you will appreciate this  movie and find yourself singing the lyrics when you are alone!",932688000,3,811,4.692857142857143

True, Brandy doesn't have the best voice for R&H but her Cinderella was a stronger character and more believable, instead of the  usual weak Cinderella.  Having great B'dway stars like Bernadette Peters,  Jason Alexander, Whoopi Goldberg, Victor Garber, Paolo Montalban and the  two step sister brought life, woderful acting, and wonderful singing to the  film.  Even though Whitney Houston wasn't the best choice for the Fairy  Godmother she produced the movie and you have to admit she can sing.  The  sets, costumes, and special effects were amazing and brought out the story  book mood, something the other versions never did and R&H's score was  beautifully brought back to its full glory that just wasn't in the 1965  production.
