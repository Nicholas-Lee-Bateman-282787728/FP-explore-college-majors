8348120,4,B001YJWI0Q,"The first film on this disc EL MISTERIO DEL HURACAN RAMIREZ is not what you usually expect from a Mexiluchahero movie. The hero doesn't fight against vampires or mummies. The Huracan Ramirez series generally involves human interest stories with a healthy helping of comedy. In some ways they remind me of the Bowery Boys series starring Leo Gorcey and Huntz Hall. Most of the action not set at the wrestling arena revolves around the hero's family restaraunt. Just as in the Bowery Boys series the action centers on ""Louie's Sweet Shop"".The story in this film involves gangsters invading the wrestling business. This is a good entertaining film,but be warned this isn't sub-titled. So you may have difficulty following the story if you don't speak Spanish. The second film on this disc is the film debut of Mil Mascaras,argueably the greatest masked wrestler of all time. In this movie directed by Jamie Salvador Mil is given a origin that could have been torn from the pages of a comic book. As an infant orphanned at the end of WWII he is taken in by a group of scientists who raise him to be the personification of ""mens sana en corpus sana"".Swearing an oath to fight against injustice,Mil is given a luchador's mask to begin his crusade against evil which starts against a crooked wrestling syndicate and a gang of overaged juvenille delinquents. This film isn't subtitled either. But you shouldn't have any trouble following the comic book-like storyline. And of course there are plenty of fights both in and out of the ring. Good fun.",1281484800,,1540,4.837121212121212
