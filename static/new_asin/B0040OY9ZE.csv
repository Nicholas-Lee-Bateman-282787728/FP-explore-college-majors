8412422,2,B0040OY9ZE,"I sure like the pedigree of this one, as director Carnimeo (a/k/a Anthony Ascott) is behind several fine Sartana films as well as FIND A PLACE TO DIE; and George Hilton is one of the Spaghetti Western genre's most laconic and charismatic stars. But despite very capable and creative direction, a hooky theme song and score, and the presence of Hilton's winning smirk, the film is a dud.

Hilton plays a notorious bounty hunter (Lord) who, with his burly, sloppy sidekick Bull (Walter Barnes in a Jack Black-style role) aims to discover the location of a missing fortune in gold. Horst Frank is the hot-headed young man that stands against them.

If you were to make a list of the pic's assets, you'd think, wow, must be great: There is an intriguing mystery to the story, as the heroes must decipher various arcane clues and enlist the help of a long-missing crippled girl. The title song, ""Walk By My Side"" by Francesco DeMasi, is supremely infectious, and repeats throughout in a variety of forms, notably plucked on an electric bass guitar.  Carnimeo's varied camera set-ups feature numerous unusually-composed and visually-arresting shots and interesting points-of-view. Hilton is sarcastic and charming. Barnes is goofy and funny, in a Bud Spencer sort of way. Still, the picture bored me to tears in each of two separate attempted viewings. (I was made so catatonic the first time around, I stopped halfway through and tried again from the beginning on another day. No Luck.) If I had to put my finger on it, I guess I'd say there is a distinct lack of dramatic tension and/or action on hand. We seem to follow Lord leisurely from from one scenario to the next, never sensing any danger, import or panic to what's happening. The very few action sequences are of that most boring variety: The Shootout. Is there anything less exciting than two teams of gunmen firing at each other from darkened buildings? In several such scenes here, various pistoleros crouch behind their hiding spots, peek out and fire, crouch back down again, maybe somebody does an overly dramatic fall ... you get the idea. Furthermore, these scenes are usually edited such that there's no perspective on who's shooting whom, from where, adding to the viewer's dissonance. Let's have some some action, guys! A chase on horseback, a fistfight, a daring escape, a dramatic leap from a building, a tense river crossing ... stuff that makes the runtime fly by, not just fill the time.

By no means a total failure, you may like this film if you are specifically locked in to Hilton's particular charm, or can forgive its clock-stopping dullness. I wouldn't recommend it otherwise. 5 out 10 stars, C-.",1306713600,4,2674,4.857456140350878
8412423,5,B0040OY9ZE,"Wild East Productions continue to be the reigning champions of Spaghetti Western releases this time spotlighting Euro favorite George Hilton in two rare excellent examples of the genre.  The films also are a treasure trove of stalwart Euro actors at that time.  The first, 'FULL HOUSE FOR THE DEVIL' aka 'TO HELL AND BACK' boasts a screenplay by Ernesto Gastaldi and Luciano Martino, brother of Sergio, who also produced.  Hilton plays the role of Johnny King who comes off as a jokester but reverts to the lethal gunman that he is when revenge enters the picture.  Gerard Herter, sans monocle, and looks like he just stepped off the set of Sergio Sollima's 'THE BIG GUNDOWN', plays the sadistic landowner who will stop at nothing in acquiring Hilton's property.  A seperate storyline has Hilton befriending a hired outlaw played by Paul Stevens. He does not realize that he was hired by Herter to drive him off the land and do away with him.  The film boasts an excellent score by Nico Fidenco utilizing dulcimers, flutes and acoustic guitars.  Director Giovanni Fago keeps things moving to the inevitable showdown.  The second gem is 'THE MOMENT TO KILL', an underrated double cross entry involving stolen gold, a crippled beauty, and psychotic gunmen all surrounding Hilton and his hefty sidekick Walter Barnes.  The villainy is represented in good company by Arturo Domenici(Javuto from Mario Bava's 'BLACK SUNDAY') and German stalwart Horst Frank playing the psycho son role to the hilt.  Directed by Anthony Ascott (Giuliano Carminico) who introduced the excellent 'SARTANA' films and beautifully photographed by future action director Stelvio Massi who would go on to helm films with Tomas Milian and Luc Merenda , the film emerges as one of the best in the genre boasting an excellent shootout finale in a slaughterhouse  which is a fitting climax to the proceedings and to the epitome of an example of a superb surprise ending- you'll see what I mean.  The ever dependable Francesco Di Masi provides the rousing music score and as the credits appear, makes you feel thankful that their are companies like Wild East Productions who care about the spaghetti western genre and their fans.  Thank you, Wild East.",1283644800,9,2217,5.008174386920981
