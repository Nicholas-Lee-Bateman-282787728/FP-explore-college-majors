3148160,3,B0015XHR5M,"Having suffered through 22 years of decline and mediocrity since the last time the Celtics were in the NBA Finals, no one could have been happier than me when I heard a DVD of the championship season was going to be released.

The best things about the DVD are the extras.  You get to see the final QUARTERS of the Semi-Finals against the Cavs and Conference Finals against the Pistons.  You are also treated to the interview between Kevin Garnett and Bill Russell, like two eras in the same room together.  There are a couple of other small extras, but nothing noteworthy.

The rest of the DVD is a 60 minute recap of the 2008 season and playoff run.  It flows nicely and it has a lot of ""behind the scenes"" stuff as well.  By that, I mean you hear some huddle conversation, post game locker room chatter and the like.  But it's nothing special.  I did enjoy the snippet that Doc Rivers explains the term ""umbuntu"", which becomes the Celtics' mantra for the season.

But, for $17, I would have hoped for a little more, especially when it comes to the playoffs.  I would have liked to see a lot more of the historic comeback in Game 4 against the Lakers.  I would have liked to see some highlights from the All-Star game, which the Big Three all attended.

If you sre a Celtics fan, it is a nice video for posterity.  And there isn't anything BAD about it.  But I think for the money, the fans deserve a little more than what we get.  Like I said, it moves along nicely.  But it really doesn't seem like anything special.

I have a dream, that 2008 will see the rekindling of an age old rivalry.

We hold these truths to be self evident, that some basketball teams (Boston and L.A) are more equal than others.

The 60's, The 80's and now the 2000's with Garnett and Kobe.

The finals are not yet upon us. At the time this was written the Conference Finals were just underway. I'm just hoping that L.A and Boston can meet in the final. That would be beautifully poetic.

Though I wish they showed a little more of the actual game footage I do love the whole part with the ""mobutu"" chant and coming together as a team. Also I wish it was longer!! A must see for Celtics fans, I enjoyed watching and am definitely glad I bought it considering how cheap it was.",1349740800,,390,4.283783783783784
3148217,5,B0015XHR5M,"Only watched it once, probably won't watch it again until each of the ""new"" Big 3 are inducted into the Hall of Fame.
But still a must have in my opinion for a green bleeding Celtics fan.",1331683200,,187,4.081081081081081
3148218,5,B0015XHR5M,"Gotta say it was an interesting ride watching the 07-08 season with the accelerated rise of the new ""Big Three"" Boston Celtics. Unlike later incarnations of Big Three's, this Celtics squad came together quickly and was as smooth as silk winning right out the gate and continuing the 'Ubuntu' theme throughout the season.

Even as a non-Celtics fan, I really enjoyed this DVD as it capably captures the essence of that magical season. The main documentary leads you thru the first signing of Garnett/Allen and on through the season until they reach the playoffs and experience some of their first turmoil having to deal with a couple of game 7's.

This DVD contains a nice amount of extra features. I liked looking back at Garnett's first experience as an All-Star in '97 along with the 4th Quarter elimination games against the Cavs and Pistons. There's a few improvements that would've made this DVD even better. I wish they included footage of the Championship parade.

Also unlike the old season/playoff reviews(the one's from the 80's), this program no longer covers the rival teams progress leading to the Finals. It would be nice to see the journey of the WCF champs road to the Finals. This would set up the magnitude of the matchup better.

Other than these couple of small gripes, this is a near perfect Championship DVD that adequately captures the magic and essence of a team that came together at the right time and reached the ultimate goal. This DVD is great for Celtic fans or even just for basketball fans who wish to relieve the 'Ubuntu' season.",1303084800,,1562,4.795539033457249
3148219,5,B0015XHR5M,I love watching this nostalgic championship season of my favorite team.  It brings tears to my eyes when I relive this historic moment when the dreams of team came true.  I can watch this over and over again.,1292371200,,208,4.447368421052632

3148221,4,B0015XHR5M,Huge Pierce fan so this DVD was made for me. non-fans need not apply (& Lakers fans shouldnt even waste their time - got their due this year anyway). perfect for the Celt's fan,1245974400,,176,4.205882352941177
3148222,4,B0015XHR5M,"This is a pretty good DVD, although there's not that much of the Finals highlights. Fourth quarters of final two Eastern playoff rounds vs. Cavs and Pistons are included in bonus features. The bonus features are what makes the DVD better, since the main program isn't really that long. The DVD concentrates on The Big Three, but we get glimpses of old-time heroes in bonus features, though not as much as I like.",1238803200,,412,4.657534246575342
3148243,4,B0015XHR5M,"I enjoyed this DVD as it did a great job of documenting the celtics historic season. From preseason behind the scenes footage in Europe all the way to the parties in boston after their championship run.

Well done!",1235692800,,214,4.631578947368421
3148244,5,B0015XHR5M,"I have already watched this dvd multiple times, although i do wish it had the full games on there for the championship series but it does to a good job at going over the season and the succesful playoff run and the bonus features are a plus",1220400000,,240,4.127659574468085
3148245,5,B0015XHR5M,It is a well set up DVD with a 100 minute ducumentary about the Celtics' 2007 - 2008 championship season. The DVD extras contain the two crucial fourth quarters of game 7 against Cleveland and of game 6 against Detroit. A definite buy for Celtics fans,1219622400,,251,4.478260869565218
3148246,2,B0015XHR5M,"expected it to be better with highlights galore of how the celtics cruised to the best record of the season specially during the first half of the regular season.

disappointed with what came out. i even pre-ordered this item.  i should have checked out prior seasons' similar videos which is the same format in terms of documenting the champs' season.

very poor. save your money.  might be better to get an espn copy if there is one.  at least espn will include many highlight plays (or so i suspect).",1219104000,,503,4.606741573033708
3148247,5,B0015XHR5M,"First of all, ignore the back of the DVD, as the main program runs a full 77 minutes, not 60.  When this first came out, I was very hesitant due to the short running time (which I thought was only 60) and rather steep price.  However, finding it now for a good price and watching how good the main program is, and how long and fulfiling it is, this is well worth the cash.  That's not even to mention all the loads of extras this one disc comes with.

You get the ""I Am A Celtic"" documentary, which features excellent interviews with Bob Cousy, Sam Jones, and John Havlicek.  It features a lot of clips that are in the main program, but also comes with a lot of stuff I'd never seen before, including the ""race"" Doc had at one practice, where he made everyone who lost to him in a sprint take an extra round of practice.  He cheated and got a head start and I had only read about this in an article when it happened, and it was nice to see the video behind it.  Both this documentary and the main show contain a lot of humorous and insightful looks into practice, the preseason, and behind the scenes with the coaches and players.  Having seen the entire year unfold on TV, these not on television moments made for a very entertaining watch.

You also get two full 4th quarters from Game 7 of the Cleveland series, and Game 6 of the Detroit series.  Very welcomed extras and nice to see this historic quarters in their entirety.  We will certainly get the entire Lakers series when the full Celtics box set comes out, so there's no need to complain about not getting them now.  We already get what I feel is a great compliment of features for this price.  There are also 7 other bonus features which include features on Ray Allen, Bill Russell and KG, Paul Pierce, and Danny Ainge.

Back to the main show, where we get about 18 minutes of preseason and regular season coverage, then onto the Eastern Conference playoffs for a good 25 minutes, until the 43 minute mark, and then a full half hour of the Lakers/Celtics Finals.  While they didn't dwell too deeply on any one game, it was a well balanced showing of the highlights.  The credits then roll with some humorous and candid moments of the team, ending the program at the 77 minute mark.

I think it was good that I waited nearly 2 months to pick this DVD up, as watching it in the weeks after the win, when the DVD first came out, may have been too premature, and not as impactful as seeing it now, after going a long time without a good Celtics fill.  I did seem to have a problem with the narrator at first, as he seemed kind of dull.  However, as it got deeper and deeper into the show, he seems to grow on you, and to the point where he fits in nicely and his delivery and flow is perfect.

An excellent all around DVD, and in my opinion, well worth it to any Celtics fan.  It's one for the collection, and will be a compliment to the box set due out in November.",1218931200,12,2924,4.241877256317689
3148248,5,B0015XHR5M,"They touch on obtaining the Big 3, the regular season and obviously all 26 playoff games!  Runs a little more than an hour and it's worth the price.  Lots of behind the locker room scenes...all-around solid DVD.",1218931200,3,211,4.675675675675675
3148249,4,B0015XHR5M,I enjoyed watching this DVD and liked seeing the behind the scenes segments more than anything. I would have liked to see more of the championship celebration but the pre-season and seasonal coverage was good and satisfying.,1218931200,,224,5.081081081081081
3148250,2,B0015XHR5M,"I was disappointed as someone who had followed the Celtics season and their progress through the playoffs.  There wasn't enough of the game play, and too much of the ""fluff"" that I suppose is necessary to please a wider audience.  Fortunately, I ""DVR'd"" enough of the playoffs that I will now record over to DVD's for my own preference in a memorial of a great team effort.",1218844800,,373,4.552238805970149
3148251,3,B0015XHR5M,"I was sorely disappointed that the producers of this DVD did not include complete game footage, particularly for the finals.  What's there is good, but why not produce a product like the Red Sox 2004 and 2007 championship DVD packages?  Was the Celtic's championship not on a par?",1218585600,,280,4.8125
3148252,3,B0015XHR5M,"Having watched most of the Celtics' games throughout the season and Playoffs, I expected to relive the same emotion I experienced since last november. But knowing that this DVD came out not long after the Finals, I knew it wouldn't be that great. It's obvious that they left out a lot of things that could have been compiled, had they waited and done a better job. Well, that's what you get when things are done in a rush just to get the product out and make fast bucks.

The main feature is well done, but don't count on enjoying the extras as much. They have the Playoffs' 4th quarter of the games against Cleveland and Detroit. What about the final game against the Lakers? I could do without the 4th quarter videos, if they had the whole last game against the Lakers. Or do something like the ""Boston Celtics 1985-86 Champions"" box and include all the Finals' games.

How about something on ""Gino Time"", the American Bandstand video that had everybody dancing on home wins?

There was also only one of the 2 or 3 videos NBA had on their site featuring conversations between Bill Russell and Kevin Garnett.

In the end, it was a DVD that will remind you of the season you just watched, but not something that will give you goosebumps and make you relive all the emotions in the future.",1217376000,2,1288,4.4914529914529915

3382711,5,B0015XHR5M,Great dvd for any Celtics fan to have! Shows lots of behind the scenes things from a great season that I don't want to forget! I watch it a lot!,1355270400,,144,3.8333333333333335
3382712,5,B0015XHR5M,I'm more of a football guy myself but I love my Boston teams and had to get this video.  They did a great job following the team throughout the season and had tons of great highlights.  I'm very happy I got this for my sports video collection.,1354147200,,243,4.148936170212766
3382713,5,B0015XHR5M,"So glad I found this.. DVD is cheap, delivery was prompt and I loved re-living the 2008 championships! Though I wish they showed a little more of the actual game footage I do love the whole part with the ""mobutu"" chant and coming together as a team. Also I wish it was longer!! A must see for Celtics fans, I enjoyed watching and am definitely glad I bought it considering how cheap it was.",1349740800,,390,4.283783783783784
3382714,5,B0015XHR5M,"Only watched it once, probably won't watch it again until each of the ""new"" Big 3 are inducted into the Hall of Fame.
But still a must have in my opinion for a green bleeding Celtics fan.",1331683200,,187,4.081081081081081
3382715,5,B0015XHR5M,"Gotta say it was an interesting ride watching the 07-08 season with the accelerated rise of the new ""Big Three"" Boston Celtics. Unlike later incarnations of Big Three's, this Celtics squad came together quickly and was as smooth as silk winning right out the gate and continuing the 'Ubuntu' theme throughout the season.

Even as a non-Celtics fan, I really enjoyed this DVD as it capably captures the essence of that magical season. The main documentary leads you thru the first signing of Garnett/Allen and on through the season until they reach the playoffs and experience some of their first turmoil having to deal with a couple of game 7's.

This DVD contains a nice amount of extra features. I liked looking back at Garnett's first experience as an All-Star in '97 along with the 4th Quarter elimination games against the Cavs and Pistons. There's a few improvements that would've made this DVD even better. I wish they included footage of the Championship parade.

Also unlike the old season/playoff reviews(the one's from the 80's), this program no longer covers the rival teams progress leading to the Finals. It would be nice to see the journey of the WCF champs road to the Finals. This would set up the magnitude of the matchup better.

Other than these couple of small gripes, this is a near perfect Championship DVD that adequately captures the magic and essence of a team that came together at the right time and reached the ultimate goal. This DVD is great for Celtic fans or even just for basketball fans who wish to relieve the 'Ubuntu' season.",1303084800,,1562,4.795539033457249
3382716,5,B0015XHR5M,I love watching this nostalgic championship season of my favorite team.  It brings tears to my eyes when I relive this historic moment when the dreams of team came true.  I can watch this over and over again.,1292371200,,208,4.447368421052632
3382717,5,B0015XHR5M,"Arrived promptly! Great price, great product! Awesome DVD!  Still get goose pumps watching it!",1281398400,,94,5.714285714285714
3382718,4,B0015XHR5M,Huge Pierce fan so this DVD was made for me. non-fans need not apply (& Lakers fans shouldnt even waste their time - got their due this year anyway). perfect for the Celt's fan,1245974400,,176,4.205882352941177
3382719,4,B0015XHR5M,"This is a pretty good DVD, although there's not that much of the Finals highlights. Fourth quarters of final two Eastern playoff rounds vs. Cavs and Pistons are included in bonus features. The bonus features are what makes the DVD better, since the main program isn't really that long. The DVD concentrates on The Big Three, but we get glimpses of old-time heroes in bonus features, though not as much as I like.",1238803200,,412,4.657534246575342
3382740,4,B0015XHR5M,"I enjoyed this DVD as it did a great job of documenting the celtics historic season. From preseason behind the scenes footage in Europe all the way to the parties in boston after their championship run.

Well done!",1235692800,,214,4.631578947368421
3382741,5,B0015XHR5M,"I have already watched this dvd multiple times, although i do wish it had the full games on there for the championship series but it does to a good job at going over the season and the succesful playoff run and the bonus features are a plus",1220400000,,240,4.127659574468085
3382742,5,B0015XHR5M,It is a well set up DVD with a 100 minute ducumentary about the Celtics' 2007 - 2008 championship season. The DVD extras contain the two crucial fourth quarters of game 7 against Cleveland and of game 6 against Detroit. A definite buy for Celtics fans,1219622400,,251,4.478260869565218
3382743,2,B0015XHR5M,"expected it to be better with highlights galore of how the celtics cruised to the best record of the season specially during the first half of the regular season.

disappointed with what came out. i even pre-ordered this item.  i should have checked out prior seasons' similar videos which is the same format in terms of documenting the champs' season.

very poor. save your money.  might be better to get an espn copy if there is one.  at least espn will include many highlight plays (or so i suspect).",1219104000,,503,4.606741573033708
3382744,5,B0015XHR5M,"First of all, ignore the back of the DVD, as the main program runs a full 77 minutes, not 60.  When this first came out, I was very hesitant due to the short running time (which I thought was only 60) and rather steep price.  However, finding it now for a good price and watching how good the main program is, and how long and fulfiling it is, this is well worth the cash.  That's not even to mention all the loads of extras this one disc comes with.

You get the ""I Am A Celtic"" documentary, which features excellent interviews with Bob Cousy, Sam Jones, and John Havlicek.  It features a lot of clips that are in the main program, but also comes with a lot of stuff I'd never seen before, including the ""race"" Doc had at one practice, where he made everyone who lost to him in a sprint take an extra round of practice.  He cheated and got a head start and I had only read about this in an article when it happened, and it was nice to see the video behind it.  Both this documentary and the main show contain a lot of humorous and insightful looks into practice, the preseason, and behind the scenes with the coaches and players.  Having seen the entire year unfold on TV, these not on television moments made for a very entertaining watch.

You also get two full 4th quarters from Game 7 of the Cleveland series, and Game 6 of the Detroit series.  Very welcomed extras and nice to see this historic quarters in their entirety.  We will certainly get the entire Lakers series when the full Celtics box set comes out, so there's no need to complain about not getting them now.  We already get what I feel is a great compliment of features for this price.  There are also 7 other bonus features which include features on Ray Allen, Bill Russell and KG, Paul Pierce, and Danny Ainge.

Back to the main show, where we get about 18 minutes of preseason and regular season coverage, then onto the Eastern Conference playoffs for a good 25 minutes, until the 43 minute mark, and then a full half hour of the Lakers/Celtics Finals.  While they didn't dwell too deeply on any one game, it was a well balanced showing of the highlights.  The credits then roll with some humorous and candid moments of the team, ending the program at the 77 minute mark.

I think it was good that I waited nearly 2 months to pick this DVD up, as watching it in the weeks after the win, when the DVD first came out, may have been too premature, and not as impactful as seeing it now, after going a long time without a good Celtics fill.  I did seem to have a problem with the narrator at first, as he seemed kind of dull.  However, as it got deeper and deeper into the show, he seems to grow on you, and to the point where he fits in nicely and his delivery and flow is perfect.

An excellent all around DVD, and in my opinion, well worth it to any Celtics fan.  It's one for the collection, and will be a compliment to the box set due out in November.",1218931200,12,2924,4.241877256317689
3382745,5,B0015XHR5M,"They touch on obtaining the Big 3, the regular season and obviously all 26 playoff games!  Runs a little more than an hour and it's worth the price.  Lots of behind the locker room scenes...all-around solid DVD.",1218931200,3,211,4.675675675675675
3382746,4,B0015XHR5M,I enjoyed watching this DVD and liked seeing the behind the scenes segments more than anything. I would have liked to see more of the championship celebration but the pre-season and seasonal coverage was good and satisfying.,1218931200,,224,5.081081081081081
3382747,2,B0015XHR5M,"I was disappointed as someone who had followed the Celtics season and their progress through the playoffs.  There wasn't enough of the game play, and too much of the ""fluff"" that I suppose is necessary to please a wider audience.  Fortunately, I ""DVR'd"" enough of the playoffs that I will now record over to DVD's for my own preference in a memorial of a great team effort.",1218844800,,373,4.552238805970149
3382748,3,B0015XHR5M,"I was sorely disappointed that the producers of this DVD did not include complete game footage, particularly for the finals.  What's there is good, but why not produce a product like the Red Sox 2004 and 2007 championship DVD packages?  Was the Celtic's championship not on a par?",1218585600,,280,4.8125
3382749,3,B0015XHR5M,"Having watched most of the Celtics' games throughout the season and Playoffs, I expected to relive the same emotion I experienced since last november. But knowing that this DVD came out not long after the Finals, I knew it wouldn't be that great. It's obvious that they left out a lot of things that could have been compiled, had they waited and done a better job. Well, that's what you get when things are done in a rush just to get the product out and make fast bucks.

The main feature is well done, but don't count on enjoying the extras as much. They have the Playoffs' 4th quarter of the games against Cleveland and Detroit. What about the final game against the Lakers? I could do without the 4th quarter videos, if they had the whole last game against the Lakers. Or do something like the ""Boston Celtics 1985-86 Champions"" box and include all the Finals' games.

How about something on ""Gino Time"", the American Bandstand video that had everybody dancing on home wins?

There was also only one of the 2 or 3 videos NBA had on their site featuring conversations between Bill Russell and Kevin Garnett.

In the end, it was a DVD that will remind you of the season you just watched, but not something that will give you goosebumps and make you relive all the emotions in the future.",1217376000,2,1288,4.4914529914529915
