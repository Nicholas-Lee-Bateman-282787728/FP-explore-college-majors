8601649,5,B00E5ZOYNA,"Grabbed this at a Target within reasonable driving distance of my home - makes sense since this is a Target-exclusive release. Like many others, I initially believed that I'd be getting the third ""Transformers: Prime"" compilation movie - editing the first four-episode arc of Season 3 into a feature-length movie. Turns out it was rather meager - just the first four episodes complete with 5.1 Dolby Digital Surround and creator commentary.

Do I feel cheated? At first I did, until I realized that not only would I have to live with my choice but ""Dawn of the Beast"" would tide me over until ""Predacons Rising"" comes out on DVD & Blu-Ray Oct. 8 and Season 3 - Beast Hunters hits store shelves early in the Christmas shopping season this year - which makes me seriously call SHOUT Factory!'s home video release schedule into question.

Is this DVD still worth shelling out $10 (what Target charged for it) to watch the return of Shockwave & Alpha Trion, the first appearances of Ultra Magnus & the Predacon and to see Optimus Prime come racing into Darkmount on a jetpack and beat Megatron like a drum? ABSO-FREAKING-LOUTELY! And if you still have doubts, the following dialogue fragment from ""Rebellion"" after the Big O's comeback should convince you:

U.M.: All units, (scene shifts to the Harbinger as Jack, Miko, Raf & Ratchet listen over the comlink) Optimus Prime has returned!
Jack: Yes!
Miko: AWESOME!
Ratchet: Thank the Allspark!
Raf: Sweet!
U.M. (over comlink as scene shifts to the airfield where Agent Fowler's squadron is standing by) I repeat: Prime is alive, and quite well!
Fowler: YES!",1380412800,4,1602,4.882352941176471
