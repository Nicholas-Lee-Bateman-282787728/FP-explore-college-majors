4131719,5,B003JZCVR8,"""The Ghost Writer"" is a Roman Polanski political thriller of the first order. It is very cleverly plotted with gripping suspense and narrative drive that pulls you into the story. Some movies of late have seemed endless; in this one I was completely unaware of time passing and was completely enthralled by this story of the deepest intrigue. It's full of conspiracies, and the whole thing is done in a very classy, sophisticated manner that will remind you of Hitchcock at his very best. It's engrossing and involving.
The acting is top-notch with Ewan McGregor very effective as the ghost writer who has been brought in to liven up the memoirs of a former prime minister (played extremely well by Pierce Brosnan). He is a Tony Blair figure who has been fingered for war crimes by one of his former cabinet ministers. He has ordered the arrest and rendering out of Britain of suspects so that they could be tortured for information.
 The movie begins in gloomy, leaden weather on the ferry to Martha's Vineyard. A car is discovered without a driver. The man's body turns up later on the island, the victim of accident, suicide, or as we rightly assume, murder. Foul play indeed! He is the previous ghost writer who has now been replaced by McGregor. And of course he found out too much while doing his research. McGregor, of course, knows he could be a target as well.
 Polanski has deliberately made very mundane matters seem full of import and menace. It's full of clues and mysterious doings in the austere modernistic house so alien to the Vineyard. The cinematography and atmospherics are terrific. A lot of sinister-seeming goings-on.
 They don't make them this good anymore, and I think viewers will be pleasantly surprised. The intellectually curious and politically savvy will be impressed, I think. Pierce Brosnan by the force of his personality makes Tony Blair seem like a nave schoolboy by comparison.",1268179200,142,1915,4.868098159509202
4131720,4,B003JZCVR8,"This movie is bound to raise some ire and all for the wrong reasons. The controversy surrounding Polanski will dominate the argument. I feel that is incredibly unfair to every one else who has worked on this movie. So I am going to separate the art from the artist.

In what has to be one of the best casting decisions, Pierce Brosnan plays Adam Lang the former Prime Minister of UK. Embroiled in a controversy regarding the rendition program, he has sought refuge in America. Ewan McGregor (he is never given a name) is hired as a ghost writer after the original one dies in a mysterious accident.

Your average thriller would start out with the base setup and build on the tension leading upto the finale. But in Ghost Writer the tension is always palpable. Even in the most mundane of scenes you are never allowed to settle. The remarkable background score by Alexandre Desplat and the camera work of Pawel Edelman which paints predominantly in varying shades of bleakness play a huge part in achieving that.

Pierce Brosnan is brilliant as a conflicted man who had to make difficult decisions in demanding situations. The movie very wisely chooses not take a stance on where it stands on those decisions. Olivia Williams as Ruth Lang produces an impressive multi-faceted performance in a meaty role - the kind rare in Hollywood these days.

So if you are open to separating the art from the artist, definitely watch this movie.",1267315200,45,1431,4.734939759036145
4131721,1,B003JZCVR8,"This is a 5 star script with 1 star directing. Polanski should be ashamed. This should be a beautiful slow simmering thriller building to an uncontrolled boil. Instead, each rise in suspense was deadened. Compare this to the masterful directing of Girl With the Dragon Tattoo.

4131727,3,B003JZCVR8,"The Ghost Writer is a somewhat old-fashioned suspense film, but I mean that in a good way.  It is a political thriller that is primarily cerebral.  It deals with secrets and lies and government cover-ups.  There are virtually no ""action scenes"" and there is lots of talking.  The viewer is required to actually pay attention...learn names of characters, follow revelations without being spoon-fed their significance, etc.  In that sense, it is a good film...leisurely paced and trying to avoid dumbing things down for its audience.

It follows a ghost writer (Ewan McGregor) who has been given a great opportunity...ghost write the autobiography of former British Prime Minister Pierce Brosnan.  His previous ghost writer died under mysterious circumstances and now there's very little time to finish the book.  McGregor moves to the lovely home Brosnan and his family and entourage are visiting in Massachusetts (the weather is pretty terrible the whole time, though), and sets to work.  He also immediately starts to realize that he may have bitten off more than he can chew.  Just as he arrives, a major scandal about Brosnan is revealed.  And if it's true, there are a lot of unhappy people trying to keep their part hidden.  And McGregor poking around sure isn't appreciated.  Jeopardy ensues.

McGregor and Brosnan are certainly up to their tasks.  McGregor is always a naturally engaging character, so we have no trouble rooting for him.  Brosnan brings his easy insincerity to the role...I could easily picture him having been a Prime Minister.  The problem is that other performers in the film are not so great.  Kim Cattrall is cast as a chief of staff sort, who is British.  Her accent is terrible and her performance completely unbelievable.  She comes across, at best, as an affable clerk.  Olivia Williams as Brosnan's wife does the best she can with an oddly unwritten role.  Her character is pivotal, yet it's tough to get a handle on her.  She feels ancillary to the goings on.  Other folks like Timothy Hutton, Tom Wilkerson and Jon Bernthall (miscast) appear in tiny roles...they all feel like ""hey, here's my chance to work with Roman Polanski, so I'll take a part.""

The final revelations of the film are pretty significantly anti-climactic.  There's a big reveal in one of the final scenes (at a bookstore) and it is handled in such a low key manner, one might almost miss it.  The revelation itself isn't as shocking as the filmmakers probably want it to be, either.  The net result is a movie without a climax.  This is a BIG miss...when you're watching a political thriller, you need some ""bang for your buck"" at the end that makes are your patient attention to detail pay off.  Polanski and company fumble that ball almost totally.

Also, without giving spoilers, there is a scene near the end at an airport that is pivotal to Brosnan's character.  What happens feels like an abrupt, cheap cop-out and not the natural result of a carefully plotted story.  And the very final scene of the film is similar.  It wants to be an ""oooooh, that's an amazing and creepy statement about the state of the world"" moment, but is, instead, another cop-out.

There's much to admire here, and I always appreciate a film that tries to engage the head and intelligence of the viewer.  If only it were as smart as it pretends to be.",1500854400,,3340,4.828924162257495

4131740,5,B003JZCVR8,"I unintentionally discovered this the Ghostwriter film at a Family Dollar store near where my husband and I reside but the dvd did not play properly once I got past the movie credits that were Letters to Juliet and Remember Me. As a result, I took a chance and bought this movie via Amazon video yet I am glad to have done so. The positives of the Ghostwriter film; As an aspiring writer it was fascinating to catch a glimpse into how the world of ghostwriting worked when the character of The Ghost (Ewan McGregor) is in talks for his next assignment with former British Prime Minister Adam Peter Bennett Lang (played by Pierce Brosnan). I recognized one of the characters named Rick Ricardelli (Jon Bernthal) who played an agent brokering/negotiating the ghostwriting deal because of his appearance in the 2016 Accountant film. Anyhow, The Ghost character (Ewan McGregor) realizes early on that his ghostwriting gig may end up being more than it initially appears to be when he meets former Prime Minister Adam Peter Bennett Lang, Adam Langs wife Ruth Lang (Olivia Williams) and Amelia Bly (Kim Cattrall) a personal assistant of Adam Petter Bennett Lang. A mutual friend of both the former prime minister and his wife died less than three days later and The Ghost (Ewan McGregor) must work under tense conditions to get the memoir completed that he was tasked to do. Of course, there are more plot points as well as actors/actresses involved in a who done it type of film. The caveats; While the film was well-done and a scandalous slant to their personal lives thrown in for realistic measure I was correct in my guess as to who was responsible for the whole debacle. My husband had a different idea on who he thought was responsible for the outcome but he acknowledged that I was correct in my initial who done it assessment but for a different reason than expected. I would have loved for both my husband and I to be surprised by who did it, not just my husband. I also did not like the ending and felt that it could have ended on a more complicated andor open to mystery type of note. Aside from those caveats, this was a brilliant film to watch. It is listed towards the end of the movie that this the Ghostwriter film is based on the book The Ghost by Robert Harris.",1489968000,,2274,4.575980392156863

4131747,4,B003JZCVR8,"Okay, everybody back in the day, back in the 2002, 2003 day in the lead-up to the disastrous and ill-fated Iraq War misadventure to get Saddam Hussein out of power knew that that the British, that then Prime Minister Tony Blair specifically was George W. Bushs poodle. That the long gone British Empire and its residue were in lockstep with whatever Washington had planned. Whatever caper the U.S government was up for they could depend on the cousins to back them up. That situation, that understanding of realpolitik is what underlies the film under review, The Ghost Writer, with the interesting fictional notion that those locksteps were not happenstance but a result of nefarious actions by, well, by who else but the American CIA. Although given how badly that organization slam dunk dropped the ball on Iraq intelligence I seriously question that proposition in realpolitik but makes a nice premise for a film.

Heres the play on this fine political thriller from the direction of Roman Polanski and the main actors. Like a lot of sports figures, socialites, and entertainers politicians who want to publish their memoirs need some editorial help, need a ghost writer to take the mass of gibberish and turn it into a finely wrought book that people will actually read. That was the situation with Tony Blair, oops, Adam Lang, the ex-Prime Minister of England during the catastrophic Iraq War (2003 version in case there is confusion) when he wanted to write his memoirs. But a funny thing happened before they could be whipped into shape. The original ghost writer, a political confidante, was washed up on shore in Marthas Vineyard when Lang was spending his exile.  Seemingly an accident so another ghost had to be brought in, this time a nameless ghost played by Ewan McGregor. He went to work trying to patch things together from what the difficult Lang, played by Pierce Brosnan, had written and would divulge in personal interviews between the two.

Then world politics intruded. Allegedly Lang while knee deep in collusion with the Americans had authorized the use of illegal seizure of suspected terrorists turning them over to the CIA for torture and the International Criminal Tribunal wanted his head. That hard fact was what led the ghost to investigate what the hell was going on after being given some information that the original ghost writers death might not have been an accident. Then the world begins to get very scary for him (although I am not sure I would confide in him for anything important since whenever he got some kind of lead he would immediately blab the whole thing to whoever would listen-and not all them it turned out were disinterested parties).

The more the ghost learns the more it looks like back in his youth Lang had been recruited by the CIA seemingly for the long-term purpose of having him vie for leadership of the Labor Party and who knows maybe the Prime Minister-ship. A compliant poodle no question. But looks are deceiving since it was not the half-bright Lang who had been recruited by the CIA but the power behind the throne-Langs wife the fetching and brilliant Ruth, played by Olivia Williams, who had been recruited by a Harvard Law professor. That came out though only after Lang had been assassinated by a distraught gold star father of a British soldier killed in Iraq. That CIA connection is the secret that the original ghost had left clues for in the manuscript re-write and other evidence. As for the ghost he in his naivet wound up with an unknown fate-all we know is that once Ruth found out that he knew the score he was apparently run over by a very convenient speeding car while he was looking for a cab as the incriminating pages of the manuscript were scattered to the four winds.

This was a very good political thriller, a good piece of fiction, but here is a sobering thought. None of the real main actors in the Iraq war crimes Bush, Blair, Rummy, slam dunk Tenet, Cheney or their underlings stood in the docket anywhere for their criminal actions. Dont blame that on the film though -see this one.",1484438400,,4080,4.781560283687943

'The Ghost Writer' was advertised by the NYT television show of the week. I viewed it via Amazon, and as soon as the first scene was on, I realized I had seen this film before. However, it was enticing enough that I watched it in its entirety, again. Directed by Roman Polanski, this is a thriller film that knows how to build up the suspense and stress without leaking a single clue. Many unknowns, and as our former Sec of Defense, Rumsfeld has said:

' As we know, there are known knowns; there are things we know we know. We also know there are known unknowns; that is to say we know there are some things we do not know. But there are also unknown unknownsthe ones we don't know we don't know.'  Indeed, they were present.

The ghost is played by Ewan McGregor in a solid role hired to rewrite the autobiography of a former British prime minister, Adam Lang, played by Pierce Brosnan.  It is quite apparent from the beginning that the prime minister is Blair. He and his family have deployed to Cape Cod to have his autobiography written. This is in the fall, and the area is deep and forbidding. Lang's wife, Ruth, is played by the magnificent, Olivia Williams.  Lang's aide, Amelia, played by Kim Cattrall, is the intelligent, aloof but gorgeous woman, and it is clear she is having an affair with Lang. Ruth knows, and it isn't long before she tells the Ghost. High Security is present with men and the big black cars that are ever present.

We know there are many secrets, but we do not know until nearing the end what is going on. One scene that is most memorable is the passing of a note at a meeting of sorts, from person to person until it arrives at the designated person. From then on, everything is wide open.

4131761,4,B003JZCVR8,"Slow-moving suspense that is beautifully filmed and well-acted. Ewan MacGregor is really extraordinary in The Ghost Writer; he dominates the screen by being almost completely self-effacing. That's probably as much a testament to Polanski as it is to MacGregor. I've enjoyed Olivia Williams' acting since A Heart of Me (2002), and she is great again. And though his scenes are few, Brosnan really gets to chew the dramatic scenery. Speaking of scenery, the north coast of Germany subbed for the Massachusetts coast; it's bleak, sandy and wind-swept. Alexandre Desplat created an oddly unique score; it felt out of place in the beginning, but seemed to fit more and more as relationships were tested and bonds broken.

So what kept me from giving The Ghost Writer a higher score? While possessed of a clever ending, I didn't find the suspense of the film to be very, well, suspenseful. Even when I didn't know what would happen next, I didn't find myself surprised by what did happen. Given that this is billed as a suspense thriller, it was a bit of a let-down. I still enjoyed the drama and the interplay of relationships, though, so The Ghost Writer is an easy recommendation from that point of view.

4131762,5,B003JZCVR8,"For my money, a great film. Above and beyond being a good ""thriller"" there's three things that really stand out here;

1. The look of the film is spectacular. Almost every shot is beautifully composed in muted shades of grey, and deep blue which are then accented by small splashes of yellow and red. If you're at all familiar with the work of the artist James Coignard you'll recognize the style immediately. A real treat for the eyes.

2. This is a brilliant homage to Hitchcock. The pace is right out of Vertigo and the score could easily have been composed by Bernard Hermann.

3. If you watch it carefully there is an eerie under current that implies that the Ghost Writer is, in fact, a ghost; he has no family, he has no name, and throughout the film characters react to him as if he were a ghost. A cab driver doesn't acknowledge him when he says, ""This place really comes alive at night"", an asian cook stares at him in fear when she delivers his lunch, he's ""the only guest in the hotel"", etc. In the end he vanishes and fluttering paper is all we're left with.

I only rate really great movies 5 stars or those that I think are incredibly novel ...

I borrowed this one from the library and enjoyed it very much. I found that some of the dialog was a bit dry in places. Some of the scenes dragged.

The players were terrific ... I found that one part of the ending, where the writer unravels the mystery, left out an important quote that the former PM had said about his wife. Some of you will remember it .... he always followed her advice. ;) They didn't have the writer recall that phrase and my guess was that Polanski and the screenwriter just wanted you to have to recall it from the movie. Which isn't so bad really. Nothing like a movie where everything is laid plain .. its my only nit pick about the way it ended.

Brosnan should be in more political movies. He is brilliant at this sort of thing. (I was not as fond of him as Bond as I was Dalton and Craig and feel his presence in scenes would work better in dramatic roles)",1451347200,,996,4.231578947368421

A very brief naked butt shot is something Ewan does well and fits perfectly into the story. If you like intrigue this is a must see.,1451174400,,358,4.523076923076923

It played fine until about an hour in, and then it started pickalating  (spelling?). That lasted for 15-20 minutes and then it corrected itself.

4131783,5,B003JZCVR8,"Brilliant  film on multiple layers. The corruption depicted is endemic on both sides of the pond. I must admit that I saw so little on the release in the US that I am surprised I missed it. The corruption in Florida is a good mirror for this film. Whilst not ""universally"" applicable to statements about Florida, the corruption I saw as a State of Florida employee was revealing. It is nice to see that someone tried to mirror the corruption in FL and the US. Halliburton is clearly depicted, as are the major players in Cheney's world. Great film but sad to say the people who make opinions are a large majority in Tallahassee politics. Maybe Polanski can do a film on the death of African Americans in US jails, and the police rascism? Anyway, its a great film because it depicts the truth. Sour grapes by the jingoisitic US flag wavers. Freedom? Not really, you have the freedom to have the Republicans opinion otherwise they kill you.
You will find that most of the US based critic of this film are REPUBLICANS who do not take kindly to having the saints in the repub hierarchy critiqued; very little can be said against the film except for ad hominem attacks. The story speaks for itself.
Laughable the way British accents are ""hard to understand""; Try understanding southern gibberish in the US, even when delivered by an educated person.

The script is intelligent and pleasingly literate, and the acting is superb, particularly the performances from Olivia Williams, Pierce Brosnan, and Tom WIlkinson. And the Blair/Bush political context (along with the involvement of the Ivy League in the CIA's implementation of torture) is insinuated with a calm, cold wit that's never pushed too hard. The movie even makes some mordantly self-mocking references to Polanski's own exile.

The movie actually sticks pretty close to the book, except for the ending, but that particular ending could not have been portrayed very well in film.  Takes it's time building up momentum but the anticipation is part of the excitement.  I found it interesting that the author was using Prime Minister Tony Blair as his model for the fictional prime minister, & has called for him to face war crimes trials.  Furthermore. the actors who played the British Foreign Secretary,  the US Secretary of State, both physically resemble their real-life counterparts, Robin Cook and Condoleezza Rice. Like the fictional Rycart, Cook had foreign policy differences with the British Prime Minister. The old man living on Martha's Vineyard is an allegorical representation of Robert McNamara. -- so understand the political leanings of this movie.

But there are many parties interested in this memoir, the hidden secrets, and much intrigue swirling around its completion. Thus begins a very deliberately paced tale of terrorism, rendition, revenge, suicide, and possibly murder, all intelligently served up in this 2010 film from director and co-writer Roman Polanski. Starring Ewan McGregor (Obi-Wan Kenobi of Star Wars) as the nonplussed ghost writer, Pierce Brosnan (James Bond), a stunning Kim Cattrall (Sex And the City), a riveting Olivia Williams, and great cameos by Timothy Hutton and James Belushi.  Kudos to Polanski for reaching the point in his film where many directors would have lost their way, reeling it all back while still reaching a startling conclusion. Three surprises await near the end. After you see it, go back and see it again: everything falls neatly into place. Highly Recommended. Five CLEVER Stars! (Available on Amazon Prime Video.

In fact, there are a few twists to this tale that kept it mildly interesting. Pierce Brosnan is a former British PM now being accused of war crimes. Ewan McGregor is offered big money to ghost write the man's autobiography. Of course we have to venture out to a secluded island, a modern house, and all the trappings of brooding mystery including awful weather that won't quit. McGregor quickly digs deep, finding some inconsistencies and dead ends. Brosnan does a good job of being both approachable and mildly aloof. The thing grinds along with the CIA as the bad guys (aren't they always?). Just when you're about to get totally bored, the movie twists and turns, which was refreshing but not enough to put this flick in the big league of derring do for the fish out of water character.

The main characters' decisions are either exceptionally stupid or simply unbelievable. WHY would he let the wife of the man he had been ghostwritting for KNOW that he had discovered she was a spy for the CIA? Was he just asking to be killed?

Which he was, at the very end.....did not make any sense.

Also is directed by Roman Polanski, who may be very good at making films, but who also is a pedeophille. Because of his wealth and celebrity status he escaped responsibility for what he has done. He cannot come back to the U.S. So unfair, for his victim's 'sentence' is lifelong, having been drugged and raped when only 13 years old.......",1396137600,,720,4.645669291338582

4131865,3,B003JZCVR8,"This is a slickly produced, moderately tense but ultimately unsuccessful movie.

Its downfall is its preposterous story, obviously the creation of a second-rate writer in whose fantasy a second-rate writer becomes an international power-broker and unravels a diabolical 40-year-old CIA plot at the very highest level (the Prime Minister of the UK) with TWO (count them) Google searches! It's absurd.

It also assumes without question that any European leader who cooperates with the United States in its war against terrorism is guilty of war crimes. Evidently in Polanski's world mistreating a terrorist is a high crime but raping a child is okay. It's stupid, it's immoral, and it's naive as only myopic Ameriphobic European intellectuals can be.

But no movie starring Ewan McGregor can be bad. He's the most appealing, attractive actor in the world - attractive in every way I can think of - but completely unselfconscious, marvelously free of the vanity that afflicts every other male in his profession (the contrast with Brosnan in this movie is interesting). McGregor is endlessly fascinating, and I could watch him do anything for hours and hours without ever getting bored.

It doesn't matter that McGregor always plays himself - playing any other character BESIDES himself would be a waste. That cannot be said of any other actor. If it weren't for him, this movie would be worthless. He makes it fascinating, but only because he is fascinating.",1386547200,,1455,5.1525423728813555

On the surface, it's about a Tony Blair-like British Prime Minister who  The movie was controversial because of the subject matter more than the story itself, which closely follows the great book, THE GHOST, by Robert Harris.

Having ghost-written numerous books for celebrities, the world-weary ghost-writer thinks he's seen it all. He knows how to turn a boring or sordid bio into a fascinating, inspiring bio. But as this story progresses, he begins to suspect he doesn't know the half of it. And in the end, what he uncovers tragically demonstrates his naivet.

Author Harris uses various plot devices that serve to have the 'ghost' of the dead former ghost-writer guide the new ghost-writer along the trail that led to his mysterious death. The use of the SUV's GPS system to lead the ghost-writer to those responsible is pure brilliance. If it seems simple to some, it's nevertheless an effective allegorical device that carries the viewer ever deeper into the mystery.

The ending is sadly ironic, inexorable and prophetic, like a great allegories often are, and it's lesson is as wry as it is bitter.

4131875,2,B003JZCVR8,"For me, the most interesting aspect of the film was that I never  recognized Brosnan until I  checked on the cast. Of course, I have not seen him since a couple of years after the end of Remington Steele;  like the rest of us he has aged, but aged very well both in looks and maturity as an actor.  He and most of the cast (none of whom are familiar to me) did a fine job, very credible in their roles. Naturally, I sympathize with Polanski who lost his wife in a bizarre murder plot in the United States and is still living under the cloud of an untested (in court) rape charge, which some believe is unwarranted (and I know nothing about other than its existence); but why he should get involved with, or perpetuate, this mish-mash of a plot, I have to wonder. By reputation, he should have known how to turn whatever he was given in the book (which I have not read) into a thriller which went beyond the trite and worn scenario he filmed. A shame, too, since he had such a good cast with which to work.
At any rate, I certainly commend it to any fan of Brosnan; he handles his subordinate role with excellence. The other lead players are worth watching as well. If you are a virulently anti-American in the UK (the U.S.A or anyplace else) you will probably find this quite enjoyable  for its subject matter if not its quality as a movie.

His longtime aid turned ghost writer, died in an apparent accident. The publishers scramble to bring in a replacement, as to avoid any delays in publication. Enter Ewan McGregor as the unnamed replacement author, who is tasked with finishing the memoirs in a reduced time-frame, despite his inexperience in writing ""political"" memoirs.

Due to Lang's scheduled speaking engagements, McGregor's character travels to the small town on Martha's Vineyard where Lang and his entourage are staying. As he begins reading the draft of his predecessor, he is bored by the writing, and realizes that he will have to start the narrative from scratch. During his interviews with Lang, he begins to suspect the Prime Minister of withholding some of the crucial facts from his past. He also begins to question the mysterious death of his predecessor.

Lang's entire team is soon caught off guard by the accusation by his former Foreign Secretary of authorizing the illegal seizure of accused terrorist to be handed over to the American CIA for torture and questioning. This forces Lang to refocus his energy from the memoirs to repairing his reputation and defending himself against the politically harmful accusations.

Of course, controversy sells. It is no surprise then that the publisher requests the memoirs be completed within the coming weeks instead of the original time frame. As the Ghost Writer investigates further into the life of Adam Lang, he begins to uncover inconsistencies in his claims. There are connections between Lang and an American professor (Tom Wilkinson) who is rumored to have worked for the CIA. As the Ghost Writer delves deeper into the life of Adam Lang, his is thrust into a conspiracy that spans nearly four decades. In the end, he must discover the truth behind the lies of Adam Lang before his meets the fate of his predecessor.

This is a taut thriller, with quick pacing, genuine characters, and a twist ending that you won't see coming. The entire film feels cold and disconcerting, in thanks largely to the production design, cinematography, and minimal score.

In The Ghost Writer, he has brought to life a story that he believes in and while Polanski has a glorious history of controversy in his personal life, he continues to be a brilliant director.

Robert Harris's book The Ghost serves as the basis for The Ghost Writer and he actively participated in the production of the film, sharing the screenplay credit with Polanski. The movie is almost entirely faithful to the book in it's structure, character development, and ideology. Some considerations were made to facilitate the pacing, but the most significant change was the improved ending.  I urge those who enjoy and understand this movie to read the book and compare Robert Harris's work in the two very different mediums.

If you are looking for anything akin to Repulsion or Chinatown, this definitely ain't it, baby.  The idea was a good one, i.e. what if the CIA completely controlled a Tony Blair-like politician who lied his country into the quagmire which was the Iraq War.  But surely there could be a bit more to this thesis than Ewan McGregor looking vaguely worried through two and half hours.  Kind of reminded me of a more recent failure, Robert Redford's disappointing The Company You Keep, which also started with a terrific premise (what if sixties underground radicals surfaced and had a chat with one another before deciding whether or not to turn themselves in to authorities after 40 something years) but piddled into sophistry and melodrama, not to mention unlikely legal outcomes.",1367712000,,899,4.818181818181818

4131885,4,B003JZCVR8,"The Ghost Writer will likely be remembered in the years to come as the film that director Roman Polanski was working on when he became embroiled in an extradition controversy whose roots were decades in the past. That fact seems rather sad when one looks at the film itself. Based on Robert Harris' bestselling novel The Ghost, The Ghost Writer deals with recent events by crafting a remarkable thriller around them.

The film features a fine cast. Ewan McGregor plays the eponymous and unnamed lead character who is hired to help ghostwrite the memoirs of a former UK prime minister after the previous writer dies in mysterious circumstances. McGregor's performance is the heart and soul of the film as you can count on one hand the number of scenes he isn't in. Thankfully McGregor is utterly believable as a man who increasingly finds himself sinking deeper and deeper into an increasingly dangerous world until the very last scene. On the other side of the equation is Pierce Brosnan as former UK Prime Minister Adam Lang, who in the original novel was modeled on Tony Blair. While there are definitely echoes (if not downright ghosts) of Blair's time as PM in the plot, Brosnan's performance is anything but that of the man himself. Brosnan's Lang is a seasoned politician who while writing his memoirs finds himself caught up in the midst of a legal battle over potential war crimes that threatens to undo his legacy. From moments of lightness to serious moments like a conversation between McGregor's Ghostwriter and Lang on the latter's private jet, Brosnan gives perhaps the best performance of his career to date.

As fine as their performances are though, McGregor and Brosnan are just part of a larger cast. Leading the supporting cast are Olivia Williams as Ruth Lang and Kim Cattrall as Lang's aide Amelia Bly, two women who seem to be at loggerheads for Lang's attention. Williams gives a fine performance as Ruth that leaves the audience thinking one thing before the final scenes change everything while the performance from Cattrail is adequate but perhaps not much else. The rest of the supporting cast includes good performances including Jon Bernthal as the Ghost's agent, Robert Pugh as former UK Foreign Secretary Richard Rycart, Timothy Hutton as Lang's lawyer and a rare dramatic turn from Jim Belushi as the memoirs publisher. There's also a nice, short appearances from Eli Wallach and Tom Wilkinson in small but pivotal roles. As a result the film is nicely acted by all concerned.

Much of the atmosphere and tension of the film comes from its production values. The story unfolds in a rather dark world ranging from overcast, rain and darkness featuring heavily in the cinematography of Pawel Edelman to the grays and muted colors apparent in Albrecht Konrad's production design and Dinah Collin's costumes. As a result there is a constant sense of menace about no matter if its the publishers in London or the modern house where the memoir is being prepared in Martha's Vineyard. Director Roman Polanski lets the film unfold at its own pace which might come across as slow to those accustomed to the fast pace of most films being released today but the result is that the viewer is allowed to connect the dots along with McGregor's character. Sadly the biggest mis-fire of the production values, if not the entire film, is the score from composer Alexandre Desplat which doesn't seem well suited to the world of film and in fact undermines rather then helps the tension through the film. Overall though the production values and direction add immensely to the film as a whole.

At the heart of it all is the script of course. Adapted from Robert Harris' bestselling novel The Ghost by Harris and Polanski, the film is a thriller set around recent controversial events. Those being so-called CIA torture flights, the war in Iraq and the disturbing connections between corporations involved in the defense industry and major governments. To do all this convincingly there is the memoir of former PM Lang of course and the tale of a ghostwriter who, knowing nothing about most of this, finds himself becoming increasingly deeper and deeper into it when Lang is accused of war crimes. Yet just as the viewer is led to believe that they've worked it all out, the final scenes of the film turn that very notion on its head with a twist that is truly out of left field. As with the novel, the film takes much of its basis out of reality and that makes the ending all the more shocking if not downright worrying with its potential real world implications. The result is a blueprint that is fascinating to watch and filled with tension.

The Ghost Writer is a thriller and a fine one at that. From the acting of lead actors McGregor and Brosnan to the supporting cast to the production values and script, it is a film that unfolds in a world of constant gray and overcast where nothing, even when you think you've figured it all out, is what it seems. Though the film will almost certainly be overshadowed by the behind the scenes legal issues that surrounded it, it should also be remembered for being what it is: a disturbing thriller for our time.",1365465600,,5172,4.800224466891134
4131886,3,B003JZCVR8,"It's probably ok.  I did not finish it, but for some people, it might be worth finishing.  Just not to my liking, but it's probably fine.",1365206400,,137,4.230769230769231
4131887,4,B003JZCVR8,"If you generally like Polanski's films, you'll probably like this one. THE GHOST WRITER is a low-key, extremely nonviolent, but very compelling poli-thriller. The mood-shifts in this film --from comedy to suspense to various other things--are impressively done. Great cinematography too: This film puts you right there on Martha's Vineyard, on the planes and ferries, in NYC and London, etc. Some very fine acting as well, particularly by Olivia Williams as the former PM's wife: She is a convincingly complex and very surprising character. Several secondary but still extremely important characters are also acted and scripted with fine realism--Special mention to Robert Pugh as the angry, protesting father of a British soldier killed in Iraq.

A few patchy places and cheesy plot elements: THE GHOST WRITER may be missing a piece or two somewhere. All the stuff about the CIA and its various supposed shenanigans seems a bit stale, and the parallels with various real-life Iraq War-related entities (e.g., ""Hatherton"" Corporation) are way too obvious. More allegory and subtlety in these places would have made this a truly exceptional film.",1364601600,,1145,5.361111111111111
4131888,5,B003JZCVR8,"""The Ghost Writer"" (starring Ewan McGregor, not to be confused with ""Ghost Writer"" starring David Boreanaz) is one of those films that as soon as you reach the end of it, you immediately want to go back and watch it again, knowing what you know now.  And if you do, you'll find that this film contains some incredibly powerful and extremely subtle acting, especially from Pierce Brosnan, Olivia Williams, and Tom Wilkinson.

I don't want to spoil anything, but suffice it to say that the film seems completely credible when you view it the first time, and then becomes even more powerful upon viewing it a second time - all thanks to the phenomenal acting.  Think of how challenging it is to an actor to know that the first time around the audience will view you one way, but the next time around they will view you another way, and both ways have to seem credible each time, but was only filmed once.  The only weak acting is Kim Cattrall's scene where she has to cry, which comes across as forced; you watch the scene and know that the only reason she's ""crying"" is because the script told her to at that point.  But the rest of the cast is awesome.

There are some deficiencies in the directing and the writing: scenes shot from angles that don't make clear sense, things that could have been made clearer in dialogue, plot points that should have been elaborated on but which feel missing.  And there is some unnecessary confusion regarding ""Rhinehart"" (the publisher) and ""Richard Rycart"" (the Foreign Secretary) and even the ghost writer's agent, ""Rick Ricardelli"" (Jon Bernthal).  With 26 letters in the English alphabet you'd think less similar names could have been chosen.  Even if these were the names in the original book (""The Ghost"" by Robert Harris) that doesn't mean they couldn't have been changed for a film audience's ears.

Last but not least, a shout-out for Alexandre Desplat (""Harry Potter,"" ""Argo"") whose score for this film sets the mood brilliantly and hauntingly.

In short, this is an underrated film that deserves more attention than it received.  After you watch it, be sure to check out the making-of extras.  You're going to be amazed that what you thought you were seeing wasn't what you really saw!",1364083200,7,2232,4.736434108527132

Ewan McGregor plays the man-with-no-name ghost writer who replaces Mike McAra, the dead--apparently from suicide--former ghost writer, Downing Street aide and friend to former British Prime Minister Adam Lang.

The movie is technically excellent and clearly demonstrates the capabilities of European cinema. This movie may appear somewhat slight, but it is much more substantial than it seems. Roman Polanski (in the special features section) says that this is a movie for adults. True enough, so long as the demography of the adults, does not extend beyond the borderline juvenile.

That sniping, aside, Roman Polanski and writing partner Robert Harris, could have added substantially more beef, beyond that which was barely alluded to (the brief discussion between Adam Lang and the ghost writer on the short flight back to Island, just before Adam Lang is assassinated)), without too much extra effort. The dialogue is mostly plain vanilla, but this may be necessary to avoid complications when translated into German, etc.

Then walks away from the scene and is killed with the evil bad guys getting away with everything.

I sat and watched a very boring movie hoping at least the bad guys would be exposed, but what happens is just one of these typical endings where you feel cheated.

I mean why would the very same man who has been chased by the bad guys turn around at the end and let the bad guys know that he knows all their secrets. Don't you think he would have been discrete and gone to the proper authorities and after that then stick his tongue out at them.

Too many films, these days, rely on special effects, incredible stunts ... forgetting that plot should be one of the most important parts of any movie.
Roman Polanski has taken us back to the film noir of the 50s, where though the film moves slowly, The Ghost Writer, moves slowly, it holds the viewer's attention until the final credits roll.
The story revolves around the Ghost (Ewan McGregor) who has been hired to complete the memoirs of a former British prime minister, Adam Lang (Pierce Brosnan). The manuscript was originally being written by Lang's first choice for ghostwriter. The original author had drowned under mysterious circumstances.
It soon becomes apparent that Lang is not as politically driven as his wife, Ruth (Olivia Williams). Our ghostwriter also learns Lang is having an affair with his assistant, Amelia Bly (Kim Cattrall). Bly makes it clear that the original manuscript can never leave the premises.
The day our author arrives a former British cabinet minister accuses Lang of authorizing the illegal seizure of suspected terrorists and handing them over for torture by the CIA -- a war crime.
Research begins to show that the first ghostwriter did not drown by accident, and that our young reluctant hero may have stumbled into a complex CIA'cover-up, which some will do anything to keep secret.

4131913,4,B003JZCVR8,"The Ghost is Roman Polanski's take on Robert Harriss's screenplay based on Harris's novel. It's a tightly shot film which somehow rides on the coat-tails of Tony Blair's time as PM, at times very tenuously. The whole premise is based on Harriss's wry disenchantment with his former friend's toadying to George W Bush,through the involvement in the Iraq war.

As well as being well-plotted,the film has been beautifully shot in dour,grey cloud-filled skies and coastal,rain-swept scenery(filmed in Sylt,Germany).McGregor remains unnamed,Lang is out of power, both are ghosts,just as the iceberg in the novel is the illegality of the Iraq war. This is a brooding, moody, chilling, conspiracy thriller with a nod to Hitchcock of an innocent out of his depth,with the cleverly shot car chase and ferry scenes,where McGregor escapes the CIA- sponsored fate of his predecessor,like North by Northwest.

Polanski creates an effective atmosphere of tension, intrigue, and a whiff of humor as Ewan McGregor tries to rewrite the personal memoir of a former UK Prime Minister, played by Pierce Brosnan, who is caught up in war crimes controversy. The untimely death of the original memoir author becomes more and more the object of McGregor's thinking as the movie unfolds.

The choice of location in New England was very good, as stormy waters and relatively lonely shoreline illustrate what the characters are feeling inside, a sense of remoteness and unsettledness with each other in the midst of turmoil. My favorite scene is where Brosnan is pacing his office while thinking through his legal entanglements, while behind him a full length window shows wind blowing violently over sea grass, and a determined yard worker keeps trying to sweep up swirling debris on a wooden deck. You get the sense Brosnan is fighting against forces that are well beyond his control, and it helps McGregor gain insight into the nature of the man he is writing about and the challenges he faces.

The final scene is perhaps a bit formulaic, revealing the personal costs suffered by McGregor as he uncovers the truth about Brosnan's character and the fate of the first ghost writer McGregor has replaced.",1323907200,,1380,4.888888888888889

Sadly, this American Summit Blu-Ray has all the cursing very poorly redubbed in order to get a PG-13. There are probably 15-20 instances of redubbing, almost always showing an actor in closeup, with their lips moving very obviously to other words.

Trust me, the cursing helps the film enormously. The replacement words are unintentionally funny and dull the impact of those scenes - the cursing is a vital aspect of the characters.

Luckily, there is a Canadian Blu-Ray with the exact same transfer of the film and the exact same extras. Indeed, I suspect it is an identical disc, as my Blu-Ray player thought it was the same and started at the same point in the film.

The only difference is that the Canadian disc, mercifully, leaves the cursing untouched.

For those who like an intelligent, suspenseful character study, the movie is a feast. The acting talent is top notch, starring Ewan MacGregor as a ghost writer and Piers Brosnan as a retired British Prime Minister who may have some secrets surrounding his political past. Both give fascinating performances, though Brosnan is supplied to the camera only stingily. Kim Catrall is barely recognizable, so deeply does she disappear into her role. Jim Belushi has one scene, albeit a very good one. With extra weight and a bald head, you won't know its him if you don't recognize his voice. Timothy Hutton gets two scenes as a lawyer working behind the scenes for Brosnan.

The entire picture is treated to a bleak look, supposedly set on a New England island in late winter. If the weather isn't overcast and windy, it is raining, setting the perfect mood for this very dark movie and the obscured circumstances of the plot.

There are other bits of nonsense in this book.  Americans don't care about Brits, and certainly don't care about the Hague -- so the idea of an ex British PM indicted for war crimes and that causing a media firestorm within America is absolutely ridiculous.  Also, America doesn't need to insert a CIA spy within the British administration to tell the Brits what to do -- the Brits are more than happy to follow the Americans anyway.

Not expecting much, I was pleasantly surprised.  The story is expertly written, with some very unexpected twists (and others that you see coming a mile away, but are none the less suspenseful), and characters who are realistic and well-acted.  Who's-sleeping-with-who is left mostly hinted-at and understated, which is a little annoying, but at the same time a nice change from the usual fare, forcing the viewer to pay attention to subtleties and work it out for themselves.  I didn't even realize until afterward that the ghost writer had never been introduced by name - which was a clever twist in and of itself.  He really is a man without an identity of his own, and even in this story he takes on the role of his predecessor.  The timing of scenes and events throughout the storyline is perfect, and the gray, rain-drenched atmosphere really adds to the overall feel of the story.  Likewise for the sterile, cold, industrial-modern home where much of the action takes place: a mansion full of glass walls that leave the characters looking exposed to the elements, but none the less hide the secrets within - and a groundskeeper who's constantly sweeping leaves off the walkway, which promptly get blown back.  There's a metaphor in there somewhere.  The solution to the mystery is elegant and unexpected, and you get an inkling of it right about the same time as the ghost writer does.  It's brilliant and inevitable enough to make some of the earlier scenes fall into place in a whole new light.  My main quibble is with the ending, which did not grow out of the plot the way everything else did, but instead was gratuitous, disconnected, and completely unnecessary, and ruined what would otherwise have been a great little movie.  It was like the director wanted to inject some totally random negative element at the end, in a misguided attempt to be ""artsy.""

But for some reason, perhaps because her role has no sexual implication, Kim Cattrall was allowed to look rather unattractive.

4131925,2,B003JZCVR8,"Five years after the faithful but bland adaption of ""Oliver Twist,"" Roman Polanski came back with a political thriller ""The Ghost Writer."" Reading the positive reviews and praises heaped upon the film, some quoting the name of Hitchcock, my expectation was high. Now I saw the film, and I don't know what to say. Acting is mostly effective, and so is the dark photography. But I am afraid that Polanski takes the preposterous storyline too seriously.

Polanski's political thriller is about a British ghost writer played by Ewan McGregor, who takes over the job of writing memoirs of former UK Prime Minister Adam Lang (Pierce Brosnan) when his predecessor was found dead on the beach. The unnamed protagonist flies to Martha's Vineyard, where Lang, being accused of a war crime, has been staying with his wife Ruth (Olivia Williams) and his assistant Amelia Bly (Kim Cattrall). While working on the project, the ghost writer stumbles upon possible clues that might suggest foul play.

It's not a bad opening, and the film's gloomy atmosphere is something you shouldn't miss, but the convoluted storyline has so many plot holes. The stories of Hitchcock's thrillers were often contrived, but at least they tried to stay within the bounds of plausibility. If the titular ghost writer really believes the ""secret"" he finds, (helped by several lucky coincidences and Google), and tells the whole world about it, who would believe it? Do you?

Of course, some might argue the film is not just about suspense. It can be, say, meditation on the elusiveness of truth. But when the ""truth"" is something too incredible, why should we take the film seriously. Strangely, however, that is exactly what ""The Ghost Writer"" wants us to, with its very political aspects which I don't discuss here. Whatever the film is, it is slick and stylish.

It is also satisfying to British subjects who have felt resentful towards their declining power in the Anglo-American alliance.

Several well-known American and British actors were happy to appear in Polanski's feature.  They are generally well-cast - with the exception of Kim Catrall, who is a British/Canadian citizen, yet has an oddly unconvincing British accent.  Meanwhile overused British actor Tom Wilkenson does a workmanlike job as an American conspirator.  Fired Bond Pierce Brosnan appears as a caricature of Tony Blair.

As political thrillers go, The Ghost Writer is as obvious as many others.  Its quality is mainly judged through the prism of ones' political convictions. It doesn't seek to convert, but rather to stroke old prejudices.  If more Americans bothered to see it, no doubt they would be offended.  There's simultaneously an American faction who is equally dissatisfied with Washington's close relationship with London.

4131929,4,B003JZCVR8,"Polanski has long had a way of turning genre movies on their head, and making tired old scripts seem fresh and cleanly written.

The intriguing plot turns nicely on itself, and Polanski keeps you guessing throughout the movie.  Adam Lang, impeccably played by Pierce Brosnan, bears some rather striking resemblances to Tony Blair, but rather than offer some polemic on the illegal renditions that were conducted in Europe, the ""ghost,"" finds there is much more to Lang's autobiography than meets the eye.

Ewan McGregor brings the viewer into the story, as he tries to finish off a manuscript left behind by a previous ghost writer who was found washed up on a secluded shoreline, not far from the austere beach house of Adam Lang.  The setting may be Martha's Vineyard, but Polanski had to do all his shooting in Denmark and Germany, as he has long been considered persona non grata in the States and Britain.  You get the feeling he is teasing his nemeses, as well as viewers, with this finely scripted drama, as the ""ghost"" uncovers juicy bits of information pointing to an unsavory relationship between Lang and the US.  But, these are for the most part carefully conceived distractions, as the real story is locked away in the manuscript, which the ""ghost"" eventually unlocks, but finds himself having to pay a heavy price for it.

Olivia Williams is excellent as Lang's jaded wife, Ruth, and Kim Catrall is barely recognizable as Lang's administrative secretary.  Like in many of his previous films, Polanski chooses to imply motives rather than broadly state them, leaving the viewer to piece together the underlying stories.  He provides sinister foils and desolate scenes to underscore the menacing tone of this film.  The Ghost Writer seems to float on the edge of the supernatural, thanks to the remote Romo, Denmark, location, like Shakespeare's Hamlet.  Ultimately, the films plays out pretty much as you would expect it too, but not without an Agatha Christie twist in the end.

Movie Review Essay (Submitted to Amazon.com)

 The Ghost Writer, directed by Roman Polanski, hit the big screen on March 19th, 2010. Starring Ewan McGregor and Pierce Brosnan, this edge-of-your-seat thriller was received by the public with some controversy at first. Disregarding the thoughts of the public, people involved in the film all claim that the film is entirely fictional, however, it has been speculated that the character of Pierce Brosnan is similar to Tony Blair, the British prime minister. This created controversy due to the fact that the character of Pierce Brosnan was arrested for war crimes and eventually died at the end of the movie. Legendary writers Robert Harris and Roman Polanski cleverly wove this sub plot into a movie with an even stronger main plot and good acting contributions from the stars as well as assisting cast members Olivia Williams and Jim Belushi. Predictably, this led to the movie doing well in the box office; collecting over $15 million dollars domestically and $60 million worldwide.

 Strongly casted, the focal characters of this engaging movie comprise of ""The Ghost"" (Ewan McGregor), Adam Lang (Pierce Brosnan) and Ruth Lang (Olivia Williams). Supporting the stars, the assisting characters include John Maddox (Jim Belushi), Sidney Croll (Timothy Hutton) and Richard Rycart (Robert Pugh). While this movie is fictional, it is set in modern day England, post-retirement of former, and fictional, Prime Minister Adam Lang.

 Engaging from the opening scene, The Ghost Writer begins with ""The Ghost"", a prolific ghost writer who has written for many political figures, being offered to write for Adam Lang, former Prime Minister of England. Eagerly, he is immediately whisked away to one of Mr. Lang's summer homes in America. The ambiance of this island is foggy and mysterious and it leaves ""The Ghost"" with a sense of apprehension as due to the strange events that occur in his first days there. ""The Ghost"" is first informed that his predecessor recently died on the ferry to the island. With no worry, expecting this to be a relatively normal job, ""The Ghost"" is shocked when, the day that he arrives, a former British minister named Richard Rycart comes out with information of war crimes that Adam Lang committed.

 When Mr. Lang leaves to try to clear his name of the accused crimes, ""The Ghost"" scours the island for clues of his predecessor's mysterious death and learns that it was murder. Sneakily, he also discovers the previous writer's car because of Mrs. Lang's help and follows its GPS to the place where the writer last was. Leading him to the house of Paul Emmet, the GPS and previous writer are correct. Emmet clearly hides his knowledge of Adam Lang and the previous ghost writer. He is then followed from Mr. Emmet's house to the ferry that the previous writer died on. However, he abandons the cursed ferry and stays in a Motel outside of it, avoiding assassination. With apprehension, he then contacts Richard Rycart, telling him of what he has experienced. Rycart tells him to go with Lang and act as a spy for him.

 Lang and his associates pick up ""The Ghost"" that night and take him to an airport. While they are on the plane, ""The Ghost"" accuses Mr. Lang of being a CIA agent based on information that he found and that Rycart gave him. Lang disregards the accusation with a chuckle because he isn't a CIA agent and they continue on with the flight. Upon departing the plane, Lang is shot and killed by a war protestor. Ignoring his untimely death, ""The Ghost"" is asked to make a posthumous publication of his biography of Adam Lang and does.

 Confused, at the publication party, ""The Ghost"" converses to people attending and discovers that Ruth Lang, the wife of Adam Lang, is in fact the CIA agent who has been cleverly influencing the political decisions of the Prime Minister throughout the years. Sneakily, ""The Ghost"" leaves Ruth a note proclaiming his discovery and is then hit by a car in the street upon leaving because of his discovery. Marking the end of his investigation, ""The Ghost"" is not able to show his discovery, which is vital to the discovery of the reasons behind Lang's decision.

 The message that this movie controversially sent was that no matter what there will always be corruption and no one is powerful enough to stop it. This is true, firstly, because of the untimely demise of the first ghost writer. Finding important clues, ""The Ghost"" knew that his predecessor had found sensitive information, which led to his predecessor's killing via the CIA. Secondly, when ""The Ghost"" was mysteriously killed by a car in the street after finding Ruth's secret, it was clear that he was killed as a result of his discovery. Without fail, people in power will always make decisions for their own personal gain and no matter what we do to stop this, it will never end. It's simply human and societal nature.

 Personally, I found this movie to be very enjoyable. While it is sometimes fun to watch mind-numbing movies, if you like movies that engage your mind and make you think then this is definitely the right movie for you. What I liked about this captivating movie is that it is much easier to comprehend than most heady movies similar to it. Gladly, I could still have a discussion with my sister about it when it was over, rather than it going way over her head.",1308441600,,5400,4.834236186348862
4131932,5,B003JZCVR8,"Polanski is one of the greatest film makers alive.  Beyond the perfect details and intricate stories, most of his films add new possibilities to the genres he operates in.  He re-made the film noire with China Town, introducing characters with far greater depth than in typical whodunnits, complete with an explosive political situation that ended in tragedy.  Now with this political thriller, in which an everyman finds himself in an extraordinary situation like Cary Grant in N by NW, Polanski again deepens the themes with tragedy, romance, and distrust.  There are so many levels to this film that I will be able to watch innumerable times and always see more.  It is some of the best film work available.

The plot involves a ghost writer who is hired to fix the memoires of Lang, a Blair-like figure who recently has left power.  The original ghost writer, who washed up on shore dead and full of alcohol, was Lang's most trusted aide.  The new ghost is a political naif, extremely skilled at helping non-writers to find a story line, but largely ignorant of the world of national security and spies.  Upon investigation, he finds discrepancies in what Lang is telling him:  dates don't match up, the narrative makes little sense, and the tension in Lang's temporary residence is palpable.  Lang's wife, a first-rate politico and extraordinarily beautiful middle-aged woman, is extremely bitter at the affair that he is having with a younger aide.  When charges of violating international law brings protestors to the remote island, the ghost finds some strange documents by chance, setting him on a different path of investigation - which he is not there to do.  Needless to say,  he enters very dangerous teritory almost unawares, until he begins to fear for his own life.

Behind this are wonderfully fecund themes.  Lang, as played by Brosnin, is a fascinating figure:  at once left-leaning and charismatic, he is also manipulative and enigmatic, perhaps a lier or worse.  You cannot trust anything he says, but his presence is commanding and decisive.  It is a study of a leader who is out and what happens once their secrets are no longer protected by their office.  Then there is his wife, whose subtle intelligence and guile are hidden behind her bitterness and seemingly pure motives to work as her husband's most trusted advisor.  She feels betrayed and is perhaps seeking revenge, yet appears lonely and betrayed, abandoned after a lifetime of devoted marriage.  She too may not be what the viewer is led to think.  The ghost is clearly out of his league, yet cannot help himself from getting dangerously enmeshed as events gather momentum.

Polanski's handling of the situation is so deft that the viewer can be deceived, in my opinion.  Sure, the ghost figures out a version of what is going on and pays for it, but is it the whole story?  It is impossible to know.  What is clear is that he stupidly overplays his hand rather than waits for the right moment as only a pol would know how to do.  I write this cryptically because I don't want to reveal the surprises in store for the attentive viewer.

This is one of the best thrillers I have ever seen.  The mood throughout is one of melancholy and bewilderment from the ghost's point of view, of gathering forces so far beyond his comprehension that he appears stupid.  Recommended with the greatest enthusiasm.  This is one of Polanski's best films.",1308268800,2,3422,4.836488812392427
4131933,5,B003JZCVR8,"An unamed ghost-writer (McGregor) is given the task of rewriting the memoirs of a Blair-like ex-PM Adam Lang (Brosnan), after the previous ghost-writer committed suicide. He travels to a gloomy seaside hideaway in America (supposed to be Martha's Vineyard -- the location they filmed Jaws -- though, due to Polanksi's legal problems, it was actually filmed in Germany) to meet the politican (and his wife), and attempt to rewrite the manuscript. As he is there, though, the story breaks that Lang is to be tried for war crimes in Iraq, and as he also finds (in the effects of his predecessor) evidence that there might have been CIA involvement in Lang's ascendency to the top.

I thought this was actually excellent and can't believe the amount of 1 star reviews! (If you don't like slow films, watch something else!) The cinematography and atmosphere (lots of sombre, autumnul greys and browns, rainy beaches) and pacing were particularily impressive and reminded me somewhat of Wallander (the Branagh adaptations), but the film was also full of Polanksi's mischevious genius. I thought McGregor was compelling in the central role (it was through his characters admittance that he knew nothing about politics that helped draw me in more). Brosnan was uterlised to perfection (keeping him cleverly off camera for large portions of the film to retain an impersonal distance and power), as Adam Lang, hiding away in his designer bunker by the ocean, whilst his world fell apart. The rest of the cast were excellent too.

I suppose people will see this in different ways. I'm seeing it as someone who loves Polanski's work, but who hasn't read the book. I'd reccomend this to anyone who likes Polanksi (or also Wallander). It's nothing like Bourne (some people have mentioned it had the potential to be another Bourne) as it isn't supposed to be. It's about character and focuses on the increasing paranoia the Ghost Writer feels as his situation unfolds, on the psychological tension rather than the dramatic tension of being chased in different situations. Polanski doesn't achieve the heights of his own benchmark in paranoid isolation, Repulsion, but this is still a cut above your average thriller. It's a beautiful and haunting film with a strong plot and top notch acting and direction. How anyone could rate it less than three stars is simply astonishing.",1308268800,2,2361,5.035805626598465

Secondly, take the first letter of the second word and stick it up the bum of one of the scriptwriters. Thirdly, take the first letter of the third and fourth words and burn them - preferably inside the nostril of the dialect coaches.

This 'film' is a shining example.

What other directors working today can make something as slow and sneaky as this film, one that winds and wends until it delivers a powerful, brutal and scary ending? The plot of GHOST WRITER is classic Polansky. Lead character is introduced and it is obvious he is ill-equipped to deal with what rapidly comes to be recognized by the audience (and soon him) as a dire and life threatening situation. Pulled into a mysterious and dangerous world, a Polansky lead can only do one of two things - live or die. As scary as this film can be - I think it's as good FRANTIC, personally, but not as good as ROSEMARY'S BABY or CHINATOWN - this film is also very slow. And it is also very gray - VERY gray. But as this plot unwinds, you find yourself feeling deep, complex emotions that few films these days can conjure in a viewer. Olivia Williams is formidable throughout.

4131939,2,B003JZCVR8,"Perhaps I lack sophistication, but I found this movie boring and stupid.

The premise is intriguing: Ewan McGregor portrays a ghost writer recruited to write the memoir's of the former Prime Minister of England, played by a very charismatic, yet underused, Pierce Broslin. As this process get's going, the former leader incurs charges of cooperating with the CIA in illicit torture. Now the ghost writer is collaborating with an increasingly unpopular person that is attracting world wide damnation. As he learns more about his subject's life, he naturally also learns about his secrets as well. Coincidentally, Mcgregor is the second ghost writer, the first mysteriously died.

Great set up yet this movie was so boring.

Lets just assume that my inability to be entertained is my fault because I ""don't get"" subtle drama. Nevertheless, the movie's problems are compounded by a ridiculous and unbelievable love tryst between the ghost writer and Prime Minister's wife, too fast of a conflict resolution, shady characters that seem more out of ""Bullwinkle"" than real life and a climax that is absolutely cartoonishly preposterous.

4131940,4,B003JZCVR8,"Yes, yes, yes, we all know that Bush & Blair are war criminals, that the film industry has a leftist political agenda, and that Roman Polanski is a scoundrel.  Now that we've got the obvious out of the way you'll enjoy Polanski's clever thriller THE GHOST WRITER--a film with several twists and turns, some of them predictable, some of them not so predictable.  What totally delighted and surprised me were the performances of Pierce Brosnan as former Prime Minister Adam Lang and Ewan McGregor as the ghost writer assigned to help Lang pen his memoirs; I must confess I'm not much of a fan of either actor, but here Polanski brings out these guys' A games, with Brosnan as a petulant politician accused of war crimes, McGregor as a hack writer suddenly in way over his head.

THE GHOST WRITER takes place primarily on a cold, windswept, and dreary island off of Martha's Vineyard, where Lang has established his own secure compound.  (Of course, we all know this isn't really Martha's Vineyard being filmed, as Polanski won't set foot in the States, which adds to my amusement, but I digress.)  The miserable conditions outside set the somber and surreal tone for the film, as McGregor's unnamed character starts to uncover the ugly truth about the ex-PM--which inevitably leads to personal danger for the ghost writer.  Throw in an affair with Lang's wife (a stimulating Olivia Williams) and now we've got a complex and multi-layered plot, culminating in an ending that had me envious of its cleverness.

To be sure, THE GHOST WRITER meanders, and the google epiphany is just silly, but overall this is a taut, satisfying political thriller.  Kudos to Kim Cattrall, sporting an unreliabel Brit accent, as Lang's personal assistant.  Watching her I kept asking myself, ""Is this the 'Sex In the City' MILF?""  To which I answered (as I talk to myself alot), ""Can't be.  Performance is too solid.""  Cattrall is cultivated and uber sensuous, which further enhances this fun film.

4131941,5,B003JZCVR8,"""The Ghost Writer"" is the work of a true master. It is Roman Polanski's eighteenth film as a director, and it proves--if it needed further proving--that at age 77, he just as brilliant a filmmaker as he ever was. He has made one of his best films to date, a taut, pulse-pounding political thriller of Hitchcockian proportions that also contains echoes of his own films, particularly ""Chinatown"" and ""Rosemary's Baby.""

Ewan McGregor plays a nameless man whose past is left a mystery. He is hired by a publisher to ghost write ex-British Prime Minister Adam Lang's (Pierce Brosnan) memoirs. The previous ghost, a long time aid to Lang, was found dead, washed up along the beach near Lang's beach house in Martha's Vineyard, his car still on the crossing ferry. It is assumed that he was either drowned accidentally or committed suicide, but Polanski lets us know in more ways than one that it will probably not be that simple. The sense of foreboding that the director creates forms its grip on us from the opening shot, and never lets go for a second.

Lang's beach house is a fortress of secrets surrounded by stormy, grey skies that constantly threaten to shed rain at any moment. The new ghost arrives and is welcomed by Lang's aid, Amelia (Kim Cattrall), who is also his mistress. This is no secret to Lang's wife, Ruth (Olivia Williams), a lonely but tough woman who is deeply detached from her husband.

Just as the new ghost arrives, Lang who comes under severe political attack over his loyalties to American foreign activities, including rendition and other war crimes. This leaves the ghost wondering gravely what he has gotten himself into, and if his predecessor's death was really just an accident, or something more sinister. Polanski gives us no reason to believe otherwise, and as the ghost becomes immersed in Lang's world of secrets, lies, deceit and CIA cover-ups, he realizes that his two-week deadline to finish Lang's memoirs is the very least of his concerns.

What is truly stunning about this film, aside from Polanski's sharp and menacing direction, is the amount of information that is retained from the audience. Even as the ghost unpeels the layers Lang's past, and slowly begins to understand what is going on, we are never quite certain about everything. In many cases in a film like this, the pieces are all there and it is our job and the protagonist's job to connect them. In ""The Ghost Writer,"" I think that Polanski and co-writer Robert Harris have deliberately chosen to withhold some pieces of the puzzle in order to generate the kind of doubt and anticipation that we experience throughout this film.

McGregor gives an excellent central performance as the new ghost trying to put together the events taking place, and his scenes with Williams, some of the more seemingly ambiguous scenes in the film, are wonderfully acted. This is also some of the best work that Brosnan has ever done, as the ex-PM who is attempting to both save his reputation and process his memoirs, while carefully trying to keep the truth submerged beneath what the people want to hear. He has only a few major scenes, but manages to communicate a lot in them.

Polanski also plays with modern technology, namely the GPS system, which is used in one brilliant scene where the ghost's predecessor communicates vital information to him from beyond the grave. In another scene, the ghost talks to an old man (Eli Wallach) who says that the current shouldn't have washed the former ghost up along the beach where it did, and that a key witness to it is in a coma. There is also an ingenious moment toward the end involving the passing of a note that keenly evokes Hitchcock.  These kinds of moments, which occur frequently through the film--in nearly every scene, in fact--allow the tension to build and build, until I could actually feel my heart racing.

The setting of the film also adds to the growing anticipation, and the ominous tone of the film, as the beach house where the ghost spends most of his time is cut off from the mainland. It is a hazy, cold, isolated, drizzly place where bad things are almost certainly bound to happen. ""The Ghost Writer"" is one of the most intensely crafted thrillers in recent years, as it blends classic Hitchcock themes with modern political allusions, while Polanski, I think, also manages to slip in some very personal incite into his own controversial situation with the law. It all adds up to a masterwork of the genre that perhaps offers us more questions than answers by the end, but that is all the more reason to watch it again.",1300320000,2,4588,4.7622641509433965

4131945,5,B003JZCVR8,"Offering a near-perfect blend of mystery, politics and human drama, the riveting and sublime ""The Ghost Writer"" is one of the most thought-provoking, intriguing and elegantly directed films of 2010.

The story begins when an unnamed author (he is a ""ghost"" writer, after all), expertly played by Ewan McGregor, receives a quarter-million dollar offer to ghost-write a biography of ex-British Prime Minister, Adam Lang (Pierce Brosnan), who's currently residing on an island off Martha's Vineyard and whose previous collaborator's body mysteriously washed ashore a few months back, an apparent victim of alcohol-poisoning.  Not long after McGregor's arrival on the island, Lang is charged by the International Criminal Court for crimes against humanity - primarily rendition and torture - which puts the young, largely apolitical, writer in an awkward position to say the least.  McGregor's official duties as ghost writer for the autobiography take a back seat as he suddenly finds himself plunged into a thrilling round of cloak-and-dagger espionage.  And what he finds is far more than he bargained for when he initially took on the assignment - namely, an intricately-spun web of military-industrial-complex intrigue that leads to the highest echelons of world leadership.

Further complicating McGregor's life is Ruth (Olivia Williams), Lang's beautiful, world-weary and cynical wife who's torn between a desire to protect her husband from political harm and her own personal disgust for the man.

The events in the movie - which was adapted by Robert Harris and director Roman Polanski from Harris' novel ""The Ghost"" - feel as though they`ve been ripped straight out of today`s headlines.  It's certainly not hard to see a thinly-veiled Tony Blair in the character of Lang, a British leader who serves mainly to do the bidding of the United States government and the CIA.  McGregor's author is the classic Everyman character - a mere cipher but with a basic sense of decency - who finds himself suddenly thrust into the midst of a life-or-death drama, wanting to do the right thing but all too aware of the power that this Goliath he's up against has to do him harm.

This stylish and topical movie has been paced for maximum effectiveness, seamlessly interweaving scenes of breath bating suspense with lyrical moments of quiet reflection.  As director, Polanski makes the dreary and windswept seaside setting an integral part of the drama, and Alexandre Desplat's score, heavy on the strings, echoes Bernard Herrmann at his finest.

The performances are brilliant throughout, with Timothy Hutton, Jim Belushi and Eli Wallach making memorable cameo appearances at crucial moments in the drama.

With a stunning climax that will leave you reeling, ""The Ghost Writer"" may well be the finest and most beautifully made thriller in ages.",1297814400,4,2837,5.28
4131946,4,B003JZCVR8,"Infamous director Roman Polanski (""Chinatown"") collaborated with writer Robert Harris (""Fatherland"") to create 2010's most bleak, cynical thriller - a perfect movie for our cynical times.  Ewan McGregor leads a top-notch cast through the twists and turns of an interesting, atmospheric flick.

McGregor plays a quality hack writer who gets the offer of a lifetime - $250,000 to ghost write the memoirs of Adam Lang (Pierce Brosnan), a former British PM in the mold of Tony Blair (well, we presume that when Tony Blair looks in a mirror, he sees Pierce Brosnan in the reflection).  Lang has left office under a cloud of scandal as his government is accused of rendering British citizens to torture-friendly countries as part of the War on Terror.  Nothing unusual in a politician having somebody with talent write his memoirs - but it is unusual that McGregor is the second writer.  The first ghost writer's body has been found in the surf near Lang's cold-yet-gorgeous beachfront mansion.

And we learn from a cantankerous local (Eli Wallach), there's no way that a body would have drifted to that spot on its own.

There's only one final point to make - this is a Roman Polanski film.

We are also apparently supposed to assume that anyone involved with Halliburton is eeevil (Daily Kos readers will love this flick).

It hardly helps that the source of all this anti-US moralizing is a director who is avoiding trial in the US for sexual assault. I guess rendition is too much like extradition?

Add to all that the lack of any clear reason for the main protagonists to act the way they do, and an incredibly dumb resolution to the ""mystery"" (hint: it involves Googling a person's name.

Pierce Brosnan himself gives one of his best performances in years.  Won't go into plot details, but found it wanting in the overall raison d'etre, but still well worth a look, and will keep you watching.",1294790400,2,822,4.934782608695652
4131951,5,B003JZCVR8,"Watching this film for the second time I was struck by how great of a director Roman Polanski is. This is a director, who at the age of 76 can still direct a high-minded suspense thriller that doesn't rely on violence or even plot to drive the suspense; a a throwback to classic suspense films, driven by atmosphere and directorial skill.

Ewan McGregor plays the unnamed ghost writer hired to ghostwrite the memoirs of former British Prime Minister Adam Lang (Pierce Brosnan) after Lang's previous ghostwriter dies under mysterious circumstances. Soon after the Ghost arrives at Lang's beach house, where he's staying with his wife Ruth (Olivia Williams) and assistant Amelia (Kim Cattrall), controversy erupts over Lang's alleged involvement in handing terrorist suspects over to the CIA to be tortured.

Many recognizable faces appear in The Ghost Writer including James Belushi, Timothy Hutton, and Tom Wilkinson, in a terrific bit role. 95-year-old Eli Wallach also participates in the film and his brief scene brought a smile to my face. The performances are solid all-around; Ewan McGregor carries the film as the mysterious protagonist, while Pierce Brosnan gives his best performance in years as Adam Lang. Even Kim Cattrall does a solid job that should silence the skepticism over her cast. Olivia Williams (probably best known for Rushmore) makes the biggest impression in a performance that will likely be tragically overlooked come Oscar season.

The Ghost Writer is a masterpiece of atmosphere and tone, being more in control of those elements than almost any recent film that I can think of. There's a sense of dread that hangs over the entire film, inviting similarities to Polanski's The Ninth Gate (which I believe Polanski was aware of with the addition of the mysterious motorcyclist early in the film). Polanski greatly utilizes his brilliant cinematographer Pawel Edelman, wonderful production design, and completely unnoticeable green screen effects to capture exactly the atmosphere he envisioned. With a complete grasp over this atmosphere, the film really draws you in to the story. A quietly foreboding score by Alexander Desplat also lends to the film's suspenseful atmosphere and will also likely find itself overlooked for Best Original Score.

Viewers have criticized the Ghost using Google search which is just lazy, idiotic criticism. The Ghost doesn't solve any huge mystery, but merely finds a few clues that seemed perfectly reasonable to find. The internet is a remarkable tool and in a world with access to such a vast source of information, why can't a film protagonist use it? I was so involved in the film at this point; I had no problem with him using it. As for the film being political ""propaganda,"" this is false. Much like the term ""pretentious"" is now used by people to describe something they don't like or understand; ""propaganda"" is being used to describe this film by people who don't agree with the parallels the film makes with Tony Blair and his relationship with the U.S. government. The Ghost Writer is a political suspense-thriller meant to entertain, not to sway anyone's political opinion. Regardless of the political implications it may make, you can't deny the film's greatness.

The film's ending is so well-filmed and well-executed, it's a testament to what a masterful director Roman Polanski is. The complaints about the ending can only come from people expecting a typical Hollywood-thriller where everything is wrapped up nicely with the good guy going home and the bad guy(s) going to jail. Those familiar with the work of Polanski will be pleased that he hasn't lost his pessimistic outlook. It's a first-rate ending that is so poetic it's a perfect end to this great film.

The Ghost Writer is the best suspense film of 2010 and one of the best films of 2010. Polanski remains one of the great suspense directors and his latest film is so well-made and so well-acted, I cannot heap enough praise on it. I hesitate to call a film perfect, but The Ghost Writer is as near-perfect as movies get. They rarely make films like this anymore.

GRADE: A

*For the American release of the film some profanity is noticeably dubbed over. Editing the film's profanity to get a PG-13 rating was a ridiculous decision as I can't imagine anyone under 17 wanting to see this film. With that said, the noticeable dubbing did not affect my enjoyment of the movie and it gives the moment when the ""f-word"" is used much more of an impact. With that said, a DVD-release should have given us a version with the original dialogue restored.",1294617600,36,4585,5.0078740157480315

The story keeps you puzzled throughout and the end gives everything away and it's just bad and makes you wish that there's gonna be another Ghost writer.  But anyways, it's basically about this guy who writes an autobiography of this politician about why he got into politics, etc.  There's lots of cheating with spouses, etc going on and everything.  Overall it was a good movie.  I watched it at 2am-4am and it kept me up so it was pretty good that I didn't want to stop watching it.  The ending just really disappointed me.

4131953,3,B003JZCVR8,"As this movie begins, the Prime Minister is being charged in the World Court with what the prosecutors call a war crime: rendition of people to foreign countries for torturing.

The ghost writer, knowing this, continues to work with the Prime Minister, but becomes suspicious that the Prime Minister may have killed the previous ghost writer. He then discovers that the Prime Minister's associates are hooked up with the CIA.

He threatens to reveal this when, as above, everyone already knows the Prime Minister has arguably committed a war crime, and when any free world leader is likely hooked up with the CIA.

So the only thing the ghost writer knows that's fresh or interesting is that the former ghost writer may have been murdered. To conceal what? That a Prime Minister may have worked with the CIA? That he sent people to be tortured which is already on all the tv stations and in all the newspapers?

I'm confused. It's like the Prime Minister is perfectly happy being charged as a war criminal, but will kill to stop people from knowing he worked with the CIA. And the movie has that plot curve: first we find out the guy is charged with war crimes, THEN we find out he may have killed to conceal them, or to hide who advised him.

What?

And why is a ghost writer who is willing to work with a charged war criminal suddenly hot to prove CIA involvement of some of the war criminal's associates? At the very end he finds out that a character is connected with the CIA, and that's supposed to be the big shocker, and all this war criminal business seems to have been totally forgotten by everyone.

What?

4131957,5,B003JZCVR8,"I agree with all of the positive notices.  I've seen this film multiple times, both in theatres on on DVD, and it pulls me in every time.  What a terrific ending!!!

A friend sent me a two-page collection of ""gaffes"" detected in the film by various nitpickers---virtually all of them trivially minuscule errors, such as the ferry rate from Martha's Vineyard to the mainland being way too low.  This kind of ""gotcha""  game can be kind of mindlessly diverting for fans of the film, but none of the cited errors make a bit of difference in one's enjoyment of the film.

One thing I noticed myself: the film takes place in January, mostly on Martha's Vineyard, during mostly miserably rainy weather. Yet every time the beleaguered ex-Prime Minister emerges from his hideaway there are big crowds of protestors jeering and heckling him.  The off-season population on the Vineyard is very sparse, especially so in January, and it defies belief that there could be this many people living on the island who are sufficiently infuriated by Adam Lang's alleged war crimes to camp out outside his citadel in such crappy weather.  And certainly they are not taking the ferry over every day!

Doesn't matter.  It's not a documentary, and I saw the film quite a few times before this even occurred to me.  I didn't even recognize Jim Belushi as the ghost writer's publisher (he has a shaven head here) until my sister pointed it out.

The ghost writer is never given a name.  I wonder if this is Polanski's slight nod to Hitchcock's ""Rebecca"".  In that film, the title character dies before the film action begins.  She's the worshiped first wife of Lawrence Olivier's character.  His second wife is continually made to feel that she is an inferior replacement.  To underline her anonymity, Hitchcock did not give the second wife a name.  In Polanski's film, the ghost writer replaces another writer, who has drowned in suspicious circumstances.  That first man is frequently spoken of in glowing terms, which unnerves his replacement.  You notice that although the title character is in several scenes in which he is meeting new people, nobody ever asks him his name, nor does he ever volunteer it.  The ex-prime minister calls him ""Man"", and the PM's wife (who shares many scenes with him, including one in bed) never calls him anything.  It's a credit to the screenwriter's skill that this doesn't jump out at you as an anomaly.

4131961,4,B003JZCVR8,"Apparently, when Roman Polanski isn't accosting young girls he is making really good movies.  Ok, so I've know that for a while (I mean, this is the man behind `Chinatown' and `Rosemary's Baby') but it's always nice to be reminded of Polanski's sharp eye for detail.

Watching `The Ghost Writer' made me realize that `Sherlock Holmes' could have used Polanski's restraint.

The film revolves around an unnamed ghostwriter who gets landed the job of rewriting the memoirs of British Prime Minister Adam Lang after the previous ghost was found dead (apparent suicide).  Shortly after landing the job, the ghost finds himself in over his head when Adam is accused of war crimes and things around him start to become increasingly chaotic.  As the ghost struggles to make something intriguing and meaningful out of the bore-fest that is this memoir he realizes that finding the truth behind the faade is surely going to bring him close to death.

Or maybe it will bring him death.

The film certainly has its fair share of twists and turns, most of which are actually probable (which aids in making this experience truly chilling).  I did figure out the ending before it was revealed, which was a little let-down for me since I was convinced by close friends that it was a total shocker (but maybe that's what gave it away...I was looking for it).  That said, it was satisfying, especially the way it is revealed (like I said, `Sherlock Holmes' should have had this detailed understanding).

The biggest asset this film has is the acting here.  I've always loved Ewan McGregor, the man with the greatest hair in Hollywood (seriously, no matter how much product I use I can never attain his perfect balance of chaotic control), and it's nice to see him working a juicy role with such nuanced understanding.  I was surprised to see Kim Cattrall tackling something so far removed from what she's famous for.  She should do this more often.  Olivia Williams is effortless here, completely convincing from start to finish and I am in love with Tom Wilkinson and firmly believe he should be in EVERY film, so seeing him show up near the films conclusion really made my night.  Honestly though, this film was all about Pierce Bronsan for me.  I've always liked him, but I've never loved him.  He has excited me with his performances before (most notably in `The Matador', where he really deserved an Oscar nomination) and this is one where he walked away most memorable.  His feverish performance has the right balance needed to create a character you understand almost more than he understands himself.  Most notable was the private jet scene with McGregor.  Watch his face, listen to his tone, and realize that he is telling you everything you need to know even though he doesn't fully understand what he is relaying to you.

Stunning.

Harris' protagonist is short on ego and confidence and has a bit of marketing and Fleet Street in him.  McGregor is perfect.

Harris' book is a thinly veiled broadside at Tony Blair.  Harris had been a supporter of Blair's, but soured on him over Iraq.  Here's where the movie excels over the book: Pierce Brosnan's Adam Lang is positively Blair-ian down to his fiber.  No less subtle is Harris' depiction of Lang's wife, Ruth, as shrewish and scheming (and more), pretty much hitting and playing up the worst rumors of Cherie Blair's behind-the-scenes role at 10 Downing St.  The Blairs can't be at all happy with this portrayal, most notably with Harris' denouement as it comes to the Adam Lang character.

To start with, Ewan's character would have to be a complete idiot to tell them he knew at the party.  Why?  Why would he do that?  There is no reason at all.  This created a totally unsatisfying ending to the movie.

And then, there is no way the GPS would lead him to the professor.  The first ghost writer was heading BACK, not there.  He would have set it to take him back to the island so it would have led Ewan back to Lange's home.  And if the first GW was returning from the professor when he was killed, that means he was just figuring it out.  He would definitely not go see the professor if he knew who he really was.

I only watched this because it has been directed by Roman Polanski, who delivers great movies. The Ghost Writer is about a author (Evan McGregor ) who has been picked to ghost write for Adam Lang ( Pierce Brosnan ) a former British Prime Minister. The circumstances under which McGregor was picked were tragic and mysterious because the prior ghost writer died. As he commences his ghost writing duties, he starts discovering some chilling revelations.
I thought the movie was excellent in all respects, especially the writing, acting and direction. The movie takes place in the confines of Martha's Vineyard and some other locations. The entire mood of the movie is somber and gloomy and something always seems to be simmering under the surface. Each character has been brilliantly written and suspicious. The conclusion is also surprising and chilling. Based on a book, The Ghost by Robert Harris, the references draw parallels to Tony Blair. There is also a Condi Rice lookalike in one scene. Kim Cattrall acts reserved a complete change from the loud role she has had on the Sex and the City series. Olivia Williams is splendid as the frustrated but in control wife of the Prime Minister. Evan McGregor and Pierce Brosnan are great and so is Tom Wilkinson in a brief but important role. I would watch this movie again. 4 stars. 10/3/10",1286668800,2,1436,4.841463414634147

Having said that, the creativity and skill factor of the filmmakers is very high. Taking the moronic and lame attempts at politicking out of the film and this becomes a very decent thriller with Ewan McGregor doing a solid performance as the ghostwriter following in the exact steps of a colleague who died under very suspicious circumstances.

Again, putting aside the schoolyard politics, my only minor complaints were three fold.

First, was the use of Kim Cattrall as a Brit. In all seriousness, while I'm constantly amazed at the ability of UK and Aussie actors to pull off a very convincing generic American accent - it most certainly is not a reciprocal skill. Having a US actor going about with the posh elites looks and sounds pathetically anglophile and oh-so-insecure.

Second, Polanski's use of a concrete bunker was bit overmuch; he might as well have stenciled in 'Reichskanzlei' in gothic script to make his point.

And finally, I question the obvious audio track edits to remove a fairly common profane word. Edits that, for all intents and purposes, had negligible effect on either storyline or character development. So why do it at all? And in the case of Brosnan's former PM - a definite weakening of what could have been a much more ominous characterization.

4131973,1,B003JZCVR8,"I have been disappointed by the endings of many movies, felt cheated/betrayed or insulted by some, and been irritated that the filmmaker wasted my time. However, I cannot remember ever being as infuriated by an ending as this one.  There were five elements in that ending that each would have themselves constituted a ridiculous or otherwise bad ending.

WARNING: Some of the comments on this review contain spoilers--additional absurdities that I omitted or danced around here.

The cinematography and atmospherics are very good (with caveats), as one would expect from this director (Polanski), and if I had known to shutdown my brain and not try to follow the story, I probably would have enjoyed the first half to two-thirds of the movie.  However, the story is one long stream of ridiculous contrivances and contradictions, all the way from the core plot elements (examples below) down to the minor details. It feels like the author/scriptwriter (Harris) took the template of the suspense thriller and shoved a grab-bag of standard elements from the genre into the slots without bothering to make them even moderately compatible, much less a coherent story.  I am not talking about the normal contrivances that power the typical suspense thriller or even the over-the-top contrivances that provide the energy to ones like The Da Vinci Code.  I am talking ones that are unnecessary, lazy/stupid and blatant (""In your face"").

The scriptwriter even fails to provide consistency between adjacent sentences in a scene. The replacement ghost writer played by Ewan McGregor (henceforth GW2) is attempting to set up a meeting and is concerned about his telephone call being monitored by the bad guys.  The other party tells him to be vague about his location, he agrees and then gives not just the name of his hotel, but his room number (even though they aren't meeting at his room).

A number of these plugged-in elements are blatant anachronisms.  Having a few such is acceptable, but their number and avoidability add to the sense that the scriptwriter wasn't really trying. For example, when leaving one house, GW2 is told to not turn in the wrong direction or he could become fatally lost. This is said menacingly, but comes off as silly: GW2 is driving a luxury SUV--in which GPS has long been standard--and the audience is well aware of the GPS because GW2 had depended on it to get to the house, plus the product placement includes the SUV's computer reminding the driver of this fact every time he gets in.

If you are familiar with New England, some of the atmospherics may be spoiled because the sense-of-place is wrong.  The primary locale is a beach house on an unnamed large island (think Martha's Vineyard) in winter, and the weather is primarily high overcast, lacking the dynamic aspects and extremes that I remember. And when GW2 visits a person's house ""in Boston"", that house is in a thinly populated, thickly forested rural/wilderness area where you can drive for miles without seeing another vehicle.  My recollections of Boston are quite different: that leaving a gap of more than half a car's length was an open invitation for another car to pull in front of you.  Also, the scenes involving the ferry are decidedly and jarringly non-American.

The atmospherics of the beach house, although artistically interesting, don't support the suspense thriller story.  It provides a sense of isolation, but one that you seek out rather than endure, and that is expansive rather than claustrophobic.

In its promising start, the movie _touches_ on--but fails to develop--a number of themes that could have been interesting in a suspense thriller not centered on a murder and this category of The Big Secret.

Additional caveats: Although I think Tony Blair has much to answer for, this movie is an unfair, unpleasant hatchet job.  And it is permeated with the anti-Americanism of the European left.

DVD Extras: Comments by scriptwriter, primary actors, director. Short, mundane, laudatory, totally predictable.  Comment by scriptwriter: ""the rules of the thriller drama are almost like grand opera ... are very strict and formal, twists and turns of plot, and I like that""

Examples avoiding significant spoilers
--------------------------------------
The first ghost writer (henceforth GW1) discovers The Secret and saves it as a Hidden Message anticipating that he might be killed, which happens during his return from a trip to see someone.  However, since he already knows The Secret: (1) he does not need to talk to that person, (2) he should know that there is negligible chance that that person would confirm The Secret (directly or indirectly), and (3) that asking questions of that person that revealed that he knew The Secret would put him in danger. Since the connection to that person was part of the public record--some of it quite prominent--if GW1 decided he needed confirmation of those facts, he could easily have interviewed that person as a legitimate and innocuous part of his role as a ghost writer without raising suspicion that he knew The Secret. Further confounding the ""logic"" is that that person wasn't home when GW1 went there, hence there was no trigger for GW1 being killed at that time.  The scriptwriter uses this nonsensical trip as a mechanism to have GW2 become aware that that person is significant.

The essential clue to The Secret was readily--and implausibly--available on the Internet and in a form that would have already invited countless people to follow up to at least the same point as GW1 and GW2.  Part of the ""foul aftertaste"" of this movie is that there never is any actual evidence of The Secret, only a couple of minor coincidences that could easily have been meaningless, and likely dismissed as such. As such, The Secret would better be labeled The Flimsy Conspiratorial Conjecture.

The Hidden Message is illogical.  GW1 had to know that if he was killed it would likely have been destroyed in the normal course of events before becoming available to the public (which in fact it was). And even if it survived, GW1's clue for finding it was too fragile and arcane.  And if anyone did find The Hidden Message, what good would it do?  It gave no usable information and had zero credibility, being indistinguishable from a random occurrence.

The hardcopy manuscript is effectively a main character in this movie (acknowledged in the DVD Extras), and is a major implausible contrivance.  Rather than use the electronic version, GW2's rewrite is to be done on the hardcopy which is then to be typed back in (appears to be about 1500 pages).  This is howling nonsense because the book is on a tight deadline--GW2 is given only 2 weeks to do a major rewrite--and this not only reduces his productivity, but introduces multiple cycles of delays (the typing-in itself and then finding and correcting all the typos).  The conceit that this arrangement is to prevent leaks is punctured when GW2 simply walks out of the house with it, no questions asked.

When the scriptwriter got to the slot in the template that called for a ""bad guy"" to lie to the main character, apparently he didn't understand that it was important what the lies were.  For example, the scriptwriter has that ""bad guy"" utter a series of lies that are themselves implausible and pointless, and ridiculous from the viewpoint of the ""bad guy"". In one of these, when the ""bad guy"" is asked where he was several weekends ago, he implausibly claims not to remember, but then _immediately_ negates his obstructionist lie by asking his wife who immediately looks it up.  He was the keynote speaker at an international conference in Aspen, not one of those inconsequential things that one immediately forgets.  Moreover, lying was against his interest: That event gave him a rock-solid alibi that was easily confirmed/refuted.

Example: GW2 is an incidental witness to a crime seen by hundreds, including police and TV camera crews.  The perpetrator is unambiguous and is killed.  Case closed? No.  Although all of GW2's relevant information was learned watching a local TV news broadcast, the police take away his passport, explaining that he is their ""key witness"".  Since this particular plot element went out of style with the fall of the Soviet empire, perhaps the scriptwriter found it at a really good clearance sale at The Hack Shack (""The Writer's One-Stop Source for Recycled Materials"") and just couldn't resist padding the script with it.

4131976,5,B003JZCVR8,"""The Ghost Writer"" is far and away the best film of 2010, despite the criminal and moral controversy of Director Roman Polanski. Perhaps it is these very qualities which give him insight into dark and crooked minds, for let it be declared: Dark and crooked deeds are afoot in this film.

Ewan McGregor's character--symbolically nameless in the film--replaces the dead ""ghost writer"" behind the memoirs of the previous prime minister of England. His (the PM's) dirty deeds come to light--a symbolic phrase representative of symbolic darkness and light throughout the film--and a firestorm of anger breaks loose at the revelation of torture the PM allowed to be used to gain information.

Who, of course, can condone torture? This is where Polanski fairly shows both sides of this controversy and the related racial and religious profiling. Pierce Brosnan's character (the PM) asks pointedly: Which airline would you rather fly--the one that pulls certain people aside for close examination or the one that allows all passengers through checkpoint to prevent profiling? The answer is, of course, two-sided--the public answer and the private answer.

So much is hidden and kept under lock and key (literally), but the deepest secret is not even known. McGregor's character discovers hidden information left by his deceased predecessor in the same room both inhabit(ed). The previous ghost writer's death was ruled accidental; the new ghost writer finally believes otherwise. Surely, the predecessor was killed and now maybe, he, too, is in terrible danger.

When he finally discovers the deepest and darkest secret, it is too late.

The acting is superlative all around, film editing is perfectly executed. Filmed in New England in a moody, misty, gloomy, almost menacing setting along the Atlantic coast, the story becomes reflective of its atmosphere: brooding, haunting, secretive, with each minute, each scene just sitting on the edge and suggestive of something imminently horrible. The great irony, as in the discovery of the torture the PM allowed, is the setting in Martha's Vineyard, the very name of refinement. But here, in its midst, is something dark. In fact, a wall-sized picture window overlooking this ominous ocean-front scene suggests the sinister watcher quality of the PM. Point: Such an excellent film must have an excellent director, so I give credit where it is due, despite that person's ugly baggage.

4131977,4,B003JZCVR8,"A throwback to the days when slow to boil suspense and subtle intrigue were reason enough to screen a film. The film doesn't require peeking through the fingers, seat belts or sending the kids next door to play. The `action' takes place in your mind. So often these days, we, the viewers are spoon fed everything and the direction one looks to is spelled out thoroughly, lest one be burdened with the aspect of thinking. I'd have to say the last good film of this vibe was `Match Point' (Woody Allen). What it has in common with `The Ghost Writer' besides the fact that both were directed by infamous men (here Roman Polanski) of questionable character, is that they are well done.

The Ghost Writer concerns a writer (Ewan McGregor) hired to complete the memoirs of a former British Prime Minister (Pierce Brosnan) when the original `Ghost' suddenly dies. While researching the PM, he uncovers, stumbles upon and is led to mysterious information regarding his subject. As befits most fine mystery films, that information comes from an array of interesting characters along the way. No disappointments here, as Tom Wilkinson, Robert Pugh, and the great Eli Wallach take turns throwing curve balls.

Kim Cattrall, as the PM's Chief of Staff communicates more with posture and a sly wink than most blabbermouths making the rounds in Hollywood these days. Olivia Williams is outstanding as his smart but strictly photo op wife. Timothy Hutton, James Belushi and Jon Bernthal spice things up along the way to make this film recommended for one of those rainy days you haven't a ghost of a chance to accomplish anything for the afternoon.",1284940800,,1633,4.891696750902527

Olivia Williams is the strong and cynical wife. Brosnan does a great job as the prime minister. McGregor is very good. He plays the amateur detective who does not want to be involved, but his curiosity takes over. Kim Cattral as the assistant/mistress seems a little vague. The plot doesn't quite hold up, but it is interesting. The ending, as is typical in a Polanski film, is a slight let down, but he gets to the end with style and grace. He adds little Hitchcockian touches throughout the movie. The movie is a pleasant suspense movie without major explosions, car chases, or multiple gunfights. He builds the suspense through character development, plot and atmosphere.",1284768000,,1025,4.829545454545454
4131979,5,B003JZCVR8,"Whatever on thinks about Roman Polanski the man certainly knows how to make compelling films. Since ""Knife in the Water"" (in 1962) he has been giving viewers psychological horror films that remain among the best of all time. In ""The Ghost Writer,"" Polanski shifts his aim at a more subtle horror -- the criminal activities of world leaders that hide behind their so-called patriotism. There are a lot of allusions in this film, some obvious (to Tony Blair, ex-Prime Minister of Great Britain) and some ironic (Adam Lang, the ex-PM, is sequestered in a hideaway that suggest Polanski's own recent incarceration in his Swiss Chalet while under house arrest in Switzerland). The thrust of the story is a memoir Lang is writing. The first ghostwriter he employs dies under mysterious circumstances (Suicide? Murder?) and another, unnamed writer (wonderfully played by Ewan McGregor) is employed to touch up the script. Soon accusations surface regarding Lang's involvement with the CIA. The ""Ghost"" is now under fire to complete the heavy-handed ms. sooner than expected to capitalize on the recent events. The manuscript becomes the focal point of the film. The Ghost's room is ransacked. Lang's subordinates are not quite what they seem (even his wife falls under suspicion), and there are telling clues in the ms. and research of the former ghost that suggest Lang is guilty of the crimes he so vehemently denies. Without revealing much more of the plot, the film follows the Ghost on his mission to find the truth. But the truth has a cost, and what is the truth anyway? Polanski seems to be asking these questions of himself in addition to the actions of the leaders who spin the truth for their own expediency. Pierce Brosnan must be acknowledged as a fine choice for Lang. His performance is one of his best. Olivia Williams, Tom Wilkinson and 95-year old Eli Wallach, who is a treasure to behold, deliver other delicious acting turns. There are holes in the script (let the viewer find them) and some stilted performances (Kim Cattrall and Timothy Hutton don't seem to fit), but Polanski weaves his spider's web of deceit and betrayal like few directors can or could.

4131981,3,B003JZCVR8,"New movies are coming out all the time and it seems the two genres which are constantly popping out an influx are chic flicks and suspense/crime/thrillers. Chic flicks usually have a loyal following. Write a tear-jerking story and throw in a cute, romantic guy and you got a hit. The thriller is a little more complex. You need an intricately-wound plot line, with twists and turns and enough action to keep you into the movie. This is where I think ""The Ghost Writer"" falls short.
After the tragic supposed suicide of the ghost writer for former British Prime Minister, Adam Lang's memoirs, an unnamed, unsuspecting writer is hired to continue the work. Soon after taking the job, the Ghost learns that Lang is being accused of war crimes and is under investigation. He begins to wonder what he's gotten himself. Over the course of the interviews and researching, the Ghost begins to see that some of the stories are not adding up. He probes further into the mystery and many elements remain hazy, but this much he is able to deduce: that his predecessor was murdered.
There are so many technical components that gives this movie high quality, not the least of which is Roman Polanski's brilliant, detailed directing. It seems Hitchcock's ghost has been visiting him. The set of eery hotels, bleak beach houses, and dark forest roads lend a ominous quality to the film. You never feel quite safe. The cinematography employs cold lighting. The music is perfect: a little creepy, but not horror creepy. More along the lines of you can tell somethings not quite right. These are just some things that are executed with such perfection that it's sure to be studied by film students for years to come. The casting and acting is top notch. Ewan McGregor is back in his role of naive writer thrown into a story he isn't prepared for, a role he seems to have perfected (Moulin Rouge, Men Who Stare at Goats). Pierce Brosnan's acting is getting better with age. He fits the bill of the suave British Prime Minister in emotional and ethical turmoil perfectly. An unexpected talent is Olivia Williams, absolutely brilliant in her part of the Prime Minister's wife. She acts with such force and confidence that you know right away there's more to this character you're seeing right away. But the script and the plot are just too weak. You know you're supposed to feel suspicion and suspense but you don't know what it is you're suspicious of or who. There's not really a focus for your fear. Which I guess might be accurate because the Ghost doesn't really know who dunnit or who he should trust. The problem is he seems to trust everyone. He calls a number scribbled by his dead predecessor, he confides in Lang's wife, he blatantly questions an obviously suspicious source about the former writer's death, and he lays everything on the table before Lang who is the last person he should trust. And not that action is everything (this is after all a political thriller), but there is almost none of it in the whole movie. The best we get to see is a pseudo car chase and someone escaping a boat with relatively no danger.
Also I don't know how Polanski can't see the parallels between Lang and himself. High profile figure under investigation for past events, sheltering in a foreign country. It's a little awkward.
It's a shame that this movie wasn't better written. It has so much going for it. I would recommend seeing it because I know some people who absolutely loved it and after a few more viewings I might too. But it didn't grab me on the first watch and quite honestly, I don't feel the need to revisit it.",1284595200,,3606,4.671383647798742

Also a plus: The Canadian Blu-ray does not come on a DVD/Blu-ray combo flipper disc.

As for the image quality of the Canadian Blu-ray release (I assume the US transfer looks on par), it looks great and I assume accurate to its source. High level of detail and refined grain, with no noticeable digital artifacts. You can see hi-res screencaptures at Land of Whimsy to judge for yourself.

The movie itself? Thoroughly engaging in story, acting, and overall presentation. Polanski still has great visual flair, artistic craft, and technical skill, and it's nice to see a thriller that doesn't utilize showy, in-your-face action sequences, but goes for a more reserved, subtle, and realistic approach.

STARRING: Ewan McGregor, Pierce Brosnan, Olivia Williams,Tom Wilkinson, Kim Cattrall, Timothy Hutton and James Belushi

WRITTEN BY: Roman Polanski and Robert Harris; based on the novel by Robert Harris

DIRECTED BY: Roman Polanski

Rated: R
Genre: Drama / Thriller
Release Date: 19 March 2010
Review Date: 02 September 2010

I won't comment on my personal feelings of Roman Polanski, but I will credit him with being a talented filmmaker. He has an elegant gift of being able to take a thriller and jam pack it to the brim with as much drama as he can, without making it boring. I look at his films sometimes and wonder how he does it. Chinatown, The Pianist and The Ninth Gate, are among his best pictures, and are now followed by The Ghost Writer.

Ewan McGregor stars as `The Ghost' - a writer who is good at what he does, but doesn't have much to be proud of in his life. McGregor is amazing. The guy has the ability to take a character that we would normally look at like a joke or a dork, and make us not only like him, but love him by the end of the movie. The Men Who Stare at Goats displays this beautifully.

His Ghost character here, is the same. There is nothing big and cinematic about him that would ordinarily warrant him to be a lead character. In fact, had McGregor not been cast to play him, I'm not sure the film would have worked.

We follow The Ghost from start to finish. He's invited to a meeting at which he is offered a very large sum of money to act as a ghost writer for a well known politician named Lang (Pierce Brosnan).  Lang has been working on his autobiography with another ghost writer, who has just turned up dead; dun, Dun, DUN!

Something shady is going on with Lang and soon The Ghost grows suspicious of this and decides to do some snooping around. Was this guy involved in the mysterious death of his previous ghost? And will our ghost be next?

As was the case in Salt and a ton of other movies, there are undoubtedly themes and tones in The Ghost Writer that can shadow current day political scandals; but that doesn't interest me. Who cares? We go to the movies to be entertained with fiction, not political nonsense. So, sorry - we won't be discussing that today; but the news is on at six.

The story is very riveting and grasps your attention right away and this is where Polanski shines the most: telling the story with the camera. As best I can remember, we never knew anything that The Ghost didn't. That's good suspense.

Lots of clues, lots of twists, love affairs, lying, brilliant writing and directing, great acting by everyone all around and a brilliant story, all wrapped up with one of the best endings I've seen in a while. The Ghost Writer is the kind of film, that makes movies fun!",1284336000,2,2761,4.422090729783037
4131985,4,B003JZCVR8,"This film was intriguing but I felt like I didn't get enough information, like there were holes missing. It may be just me, it had really good suspense and acting, yet the leads didn't seem to bring closure to me. Its about a former Prime Minister who is being thrown in the media for committing war crimes. Before this happens he has a ghost writer writing his memoirs, who unfortunately dies in a drowning that has some possible funny business written on it. In walks Ewan, the next ghost writer picking up the slack. He is very straight forward, not really evocative in his speech or manner, a person who is quiet and inward. He finds clues that cause him to ponder, did the other writer possibly get murdered. During that time his subject is being whisked away to Washington to respond to the allegations of possible terrorist suspects being tortured. The prime minister is visibly shaken and his wife who plays a strong regal woman, seems overwrought over his not following her guidance. He usually follows her advice she tells Ewan's character. Things get more involved with the couple Ewan is learning and writing about. He finds out secret information which leads to more intrigue. It is confusing did the Prime Minister get involved with the CIA before becoming a Prime Minister, or was it just his spouse involved in a triage of deceit? Was the Minister used by his wife and her tutor Emmet to be placed the role of Prime Minister in Great Britain? Did they manipulate a carefree actor who chased women by using a love interest to attract him on their path instead of his own, made by conscious choice? These are questions. Later on, was he set up somehow with the crimes, used, than taken out of commision on purpose as was his friend the first ghostwriter? Did the first writer have pertinent information to leak to the Minister before his death? Again lots of contemplation from this mystical raindrenched movie. The things I liked about this film were the beautiful glass encased room showing the long stretch of beach with sea grassy dunes spread out like a visual feast, the beauty of the compactness the house reflected, the big sandwich that Ewan had made for him by the housekeeper, the super quiet storybook hotel, with the little hostess dressed as a swiss maid and I liked the job Ewan had. It seemed like it would be fun to write and have all the accessories that came with the career. He also had the opportunity to meet people who were interesting and find out things that were something not everybody has privy to.

4131988,4,B003JZCVR8,"This movie was recommended to me by an anglophile colleague with an interest in British politics.

My first reaction was to the miscasting of Kim Catrell who provides an unconvincing portrayal of a British aide with a foreign accent.

Overall the movie held my interest with the viewer trying to pice together the clues before the revelations near the end.

Anyone with any prior knowledge of parliamentarian protocols would understand the creative licenses utilized by the film makers permit the story to start. No stuffy civil servants or intelligence offices to scan the text for breaches of the official secrets act or divulge any policy decisions.

The dramatization involving Ewan Macgreggor was excellent. His bedroom scene with the ex-PM's wife where he calmly removes his clothes and gets into bed with her before she suddenly pounces was comical but typically British.

My greatest admiration comes for the British actor who portrays the stuck up Harvard professor with an excellent New England accent extremely well.

The ending was really overdone. Like the RSC version of Romeo and Juliet which involved death by hypodermic, the death of the ghost writer at the end seemed stupid and pointless, not because you saw it coming but in the manner of it, highly improbable to say the least.

Polanski sometimes overdoes his movies with too much music and in this case with too much overbearing dreary music, very much so in comparison with Gorky Park for instance.

All in all, a reasonably good effort despite February looking like October.",1284163200,,1549,5.070866141732283
4131989,5,B003JZCVR8,"Movie - 4.5

I know the name Roman Polanski, but I'm embarrassed to say this is only the first film of his I've ever seen. My curiosity for this movie was nudged after hearing his name and the names of some very fine actors being involved, namely: Ewan McGregor, Pierce Brosnan, Olivia Williams, and Tom Wilkinson. In watching The Ghost Writer, I had gone in expecting some sort of political thriller along the lines of State of Play (the last political thriller I saw and really, really liked); something with a lot of twists, turns, and deception from every which way until a shocking resolution was reached. Instead, I was completely surprised with a good deal of British charm, wit, and whimsicality involved, and then a little dazzle in the discovery of one Mr. Polanski's talent. The Ghost Writer is, indeed, a thriller that managed to captivate and keep me guessing what would happen next, but in a very odd manner. Usually, when watching political thrillers, or thrillers in general, I've always had this ""expectancy of complexity"" factor in which I just about always expected the unexpected to happen, and often. But in experiencing this film, I was surprised at how it achieved the same effect, though in much less flashy theatrics and writing. From the very beginning, we know someone is dead, this ghost is assigned to finish the memoirs of a controversial former Prime Minister, and that things just logically snowball deeper and deeper into conspiracy. However, what surprised me the most was at how well-ground and down-to-earth the screenplay felt. It was very simple in nature, and not at all what I was expecting, and yet I couldn't help but become more and more intrigued by the mysteries that lied therein until everything came to revelation, and the movie was over just as the symbolism of the ghost implies. If Polanski was always this good, then I apologize up-front that I never bothered to discover him in the first place. The drama, sleuthing, and pacing were very enjoyable.

Video - 5.0

You wouldn't think a political thriller would make for much reference-level material, but don't let the generalization fool you. The Ghost Writer looks stunning on BD with a perfect transfer whose simplicity in writing is as deceptively commendable as its photography. Colors offer a wide selection of vibrancy throughout the various locations, sets, and costumes. And as plain as they are, flawless picture reproduction is still flawless. Black levels are deep and equally without fault, providing for some excellent foreshadowing as the film progresses. And speaking of shadows, line/shadow delineation is some of the best I've seen in recent memory (in relation to recent films). There were parts of the movie when McGregor would be sitting and reading in the dark, and the level of depth between his silhouette, the shadows behind him, and the natural lighting from the screen were ridiculously accurate and separated from one another. Contrast and lighting benefit from this very much as well, as apparent in the very fine skin and cloth detail from the gray hairs on Brosnan's head, to the fibers of a bath robe, to the stretch (or plastic surgery) marks on Kim Cattrall's body (have to say, though, she looks pretty good for 54). Sharpness is razor sharp and presents the overall photography with a kind of subtlety worthy of Blu-ray and the hype that comes along with its label of ""pristine picture."" This is definitely a winner, and should get at least an Oscar nomination for cinematography.

Audio - 4.5

Again, political thrillers don't usually instill that, ""wow, that's going to sound awesome,"" kind of feeling, but this movie just kept surprising me. Dialogue sounds perfect through the center and all (don't know how anyone can screw that up), and the script/acting come off very well to help the carry the plot. My biggest surprise, though, is in the score. Alexandre Desplat's compositions completely caught me off guard. They're not bad or anything, but the instrumentation and overall ambiance just really kept me into the film for some reason. It'd be something tense and suspenseful at one moment with a bunch of strings, and then all of a sudden transition into an almost goofy set of drums, woodwinds, and brass that, strangely, still had the right sense of setting a tone. I really don't know how to explain the feeling I got from his work, but it seemed off, yet oddly satisfying. As for sound effects, a lot of it is left to a particular kind of ambiance as well. The effects are relatively just there in the background, like cars driving on gravel, rainfall, ocean waves, the wind, or various creaks and taps on the furniture, but it makes for a great mix, regardless of their frivolities. I think my subwoofer went to standby once or twice from the inactivity of LFEs, so that should be pretty self-explanatory. For a film like this, though, you don't really need them.

Extras - 3.5

Not a whole lot of special features here other than an interview with the author of the original novel, Robert Harris (who is also the screenwriter for the film), interviews with the four main actors in what they thought about working with Polanski, and then an interview with Polanski himself, all of which are presented in HD. I'm going to go out on a limb here and say that, while the extras themselves don't amount to much in terms of quantity (just under 30 minutes), I still very much enjoyed the quality of them, mainly because this is the only thing I've ever come to see or hear about in relation to Roman Polanski and the notoriety that comes with his name as a director. From what I've heard about him, I get this image that he's a highly-renowned and very well-respected director that's something of an icon in the industry. And after hearing these comments about him, I'd even go to say the general consensus is to call him a sort of living legend. From his demeanor and the quality of work shown in this film, I can certainly see why he's earned a lot of this praise, and I'm very curious to play catchup on his career now. With that being said, I thought the extras also helped to add a decent amount of depth to the characters, plot, and filming process, though obviously they could've been longer or more fully-explained. I also would've loved to have heard an audio commentary by Polanski and Harris for the film, but too bad, I guess. Despite these shortcomings, I was pleased to be enlightened about Polanski's image in general.

Overall - 4.5

The Ghost Writer certainly won't be everyone's cup of tea. It's a thriller, yes, but it's nowhere near as fancy or flashy as a gangster, cop, or espionage entry into the genre. It's a much more simplistic, logical, almost humdrum kind of thriller filled with witty characters and tout dialogue, but could still be entertaining if you're in to this type of film. I'd never seen a Polanski film till now, but I'm proud to say I'm damn curious to see some more. With reference video, near-reference audio, and a pretty short, though very informative, set of extras (for me, anyway), I highly recommend this BD for fans of the movie. Others may want to give it a rent to see if it fits their preferences, first.",1283817600,3,7202,4.773675762439807
4131990,3,B003JZCVR8,"Director Roman Polanski has crafted a stylish yet astonishingly predictable thriller based on Robert Harris' topical 2007 novel. Despite the familiar twists and turns, a strong cast and Polanski's formidable skill maintain interest. ""The Ghost Writer"" does not rank with the filmmaker's best work, yet it is miles ahead of earlier misfires such as ""Frantic"" and ""Bitter Moon."" Worth seeing for Ewan McGregor's compelling performance in the title role.",1283817600,4,451,5.550724637681159
4131991,3,B003JZCVR8,"Roman Polanski hates America. Really hates it. Which is a bit of an ingrate attitude, seeing as America has given him so many opportunities to direct films in Hollywood, using American stars. Thanks to America, Roman Polanski is an internationally-famous auteur, and not just a regional European product. Mr. Polanski is also internationally-infamous for his conviction of statuatory rape of an American 13-year-old, on American soil, and that more than anything, explains his anti-American bias. Even if he does like to dress up his personal vendetta in 'political' clothing. Quite a way to treat a country who's been so good to him and who was instrumental in creating the nation of Israel. Go figure.

The film is an adaptation of 'The Ghost' by Robert Harris, the screenplay of which Polanski co-wrote with the author. So, the political ideas herein are not solely Polanski's, but seeing as Harris shares Roman's anti-American bias, it becomes easy to see why Polanski would have been drawn to this project. You've probably heard the plot: a talented ghost writer between jobs (Ewan McGregor--in the style of ""Rebecca"" our main protagonist is never given a name) is hired as a last-minute replacement for another ghost writer whose body washed up on the beach while working on the memoirs of the former British Prime Minister, Adam Lang (Pierce Brosnan). Despite misgivings, our ghost takes the job, only to be immediately mugged by thugs who think he is carrying the manuscript. The manuscript is kept under lock and key at the PM's palatial compound on Montauk, to which our ghost goes. He has to stay at the house because the manuscript is not permitted to leave the room it's kept in. While he's there working, strange undercurrents swirl around him in the house, and the story breaks in the international media that a former cabinet minister of the PM has accused him of war crimes for his complicity in Iraqi torture. The ghost soon discovers that by continuing work on this project, there is a very good chance he will share his predecessor's fate. But what he, and we don't understand is, why? What is in the PM's past, buried deep in his memoir, that people will kill in order to keep it hidden?

Now, I will give credit where credit is due: no one excels Polanski in the tension-building set-up, or in creating an atmosphere of increasingly-ratcheted up suspense. As in his Frantic (1988) with Harrison Ford, he puts a guy who is professionally accomplished yet politically naive into a sinister situation where he is completely out of his element, and turns him loose to see how he will cope. The creepy visual effects of the gray winter beach and sky outside the PM's sterile, modern house that seems entirely made of glass create this sense of forboding and opressive isolation that serves the story well. And, in whatever capacity the director deserves credit for these things, he ellicits terrific perfomances from his cast. Ewan McGregor anchors the movie, since he's in every scene. The character McGregor gives us here goes against his usual charismatic and self-confident type: something of a lost and passive man who is just drifting along with events, but watching him carry this movie, and seeing the physicality he has developed convinces me that the rumors that he was considered a leading contender for the reboot of the James Bond franchise aren't as far-fetched as previously thought.  Pierce Brosnan, best known as an affable light comedian and action star really displays his dramatic chops as the embattled PM. Here, Brosnan is portraying a man who is considered, though telegenic and popular, a political lightweight, an 'actor' rather than a serious political mind. Mr. Brosnan may have found some parallels between his character and himself: in drama school, the impossibly handsome Pierce was affectionately lampooned by his fellow classmates with the nickname ""Hollywood""--everyone predicted, rightly, that his looks would make him a huge star, but on the flip side, nobody is willing to take anyone that good looking seriously, or give them credit for more than superficial ambitions. Guess Mr. Brosnan has been able to have his cake and eat it too, thereby proving that he is more than just a pretty face.  It is impossible not to draw parallels between his fictional Adam Lang and Tony Blair, who despite being beloved for pulling his nation through the Princess Diana crisis and being elected a resounding three times by his fellow Britons, is in hindsight treated by the media intelligentsia (of which Polanski and Harris are part) with withering scorn as some sort of lapdog to two American presidents. The American government and the CIA are supposed to be the real baddies here. McGregor and Brosnan are supported by a cadre of reliable actors doing the kinds of parts they do best, most notably Tom Wilkinson and Olivia Williams. Kim Cattrall (aka Samantha on SATC) plays the PM's efficient secretary and not-so-secret mistress. She looks great, but whatever accent she's attempting drifts in and out making her something of a caricature.

As strictly a piece of suspense, The Ghost Writer delivers a moody, mostly effective thriller, though portions of it could be tighter. I dozed off a time or two before things really got going. But ultimately it's impossible to divorce the action from the political subtext, and there are so many holes in the logic that the piece sinks under the weight of its own self-importance. Had this been made a generation ago, in the height of Cold War paranoia, it would have seemed to have a bit more heft. At the final reveal, we are left going . . .Is THAT it? Really? In the end, Polanski's final card, which he seems to slap down on the table with an ""A HA!"" falls flat because it doesn't even make sense. Just prior to that, there is a stunt involving an anagram of sorts that was put to much more chilling use in ""Rosemary's Baby"" with Scrabble tiles. To trot out a similar device again feels tired, and in this case is dramatically flabby.

In the final analyisis of this movie, I can't say that Mr. Polanski will have won himself any new friends in the American government who are already none too fond of him, but that the British government has an even greater reason to be ticked off with Roman. Apparently Mr. Polanski does not have a high opinion of Great Britain either. Which makes him a darling in France, certainment!

I found this disappointing after having looked forward to it for quite a while. It earns 4 stars for the production design, but on the whole, only a three-star effort.",1283731200,5,6584,4.873214285714286
4131992,4,B003JZCVR8,"This controversial thriller and murder mystery implies that a certain former British prime minister had a very big, explosive secret.  Some readers of the Robert Harris novel think it's based on true events.  Whatever you think of Roman Polanski, his film adaptation does nothing to remove the aura of a real life secret exposed.  This is old school filmmaking at it's best.  Ewan McGregor is a ghostwriter assigned to go to an isolated estate along New England's east coast and write the memoirs of the secluded Adam Lang (Pierce Bronson).  The ambitious writer is quickly seduced by the power of sex and politics as the shocking story he uncovers becomes deadly.  I liked this solid suspenser that many film goers overlooked.

4131994,1,B003JZCVR8,"Offered here for our disapproval is a contemptible former British Prime Minister, a revisionist's Tony Blair amorally in bed with a mistress and with the evil U.S. in its war vs. terrorism. This one-dimensional character's alleged ""crime against humanity"" was the rendering of a couple of British Islamic terror suspects to the diabolical CIA for interrogation. A suspect dies in custody. While not presented as the cause of death, waterboarding is mentioned repeatedly and becomes a focal point of this story's self-righteous wrath.

It is a matter of debate whether waterboarding, which produces plenty of physical and psychological stress but causes no physical harm, is torture. Yet this ""crime"" is judged in the movie's court of public opinion by anti-war zealots and media without the movie offering an opposing viewpoint.

A more intellectually honest script would have presented the moral dilemma between the wartime pursuit of mass murderers whose main tactic is targeting civilians vs. preserving the civil liberties that such pursuit endangers. These worthy and sometimes-conflicting endeavors deserve at least cursory examination here. Just a few lines among the PM's own inner circle explaining to the audience his rationales could suffice. The most we get is the PM's brief and shallow statement about the ""defense of freedom,"" intentionally presented to us as a vapid media sound bite. His cooperation is simplistically presented as definitional evil as if no justification could possibly exist.

It is that one-sided presentation of a clearly controversial matter that makes this movie as propagandistic as if it were approved for public consumption by the Iranian Supreme Court. It assumes unquestioning agreement by the audience of its central theme -- that waterboarding is torture and a crime against humanity. That may be a ""fact"" to the anti-war crowd, but not to us all, and it's a lie to present it as such.",1283472000,10,1931,5.303921568627451

I saw it twice in three days and this film replaces all before it as the Film Of The Year. Truly Hitchcockian. What attention to details! Build up and suspense is truly magnetic. Embellished by an outstanding musical score by Alexandre Desplat. Hear it. Roman Polanski has handled this script with an ease like Alfred Hitchcock would have done with Saboteur and The Man who Knew Too Much. I was first bowled over by Polanski's 'Rosemary's Baby' and 'The Tenant'. This film is in the true tradition of how a tale has to be told even if the tale has political overtones. Any other director would have found the going dry and tough. Ewan Mcgregor, I always felt had the potential to deliver; and he has done greatly. Pierce Brosnan is adequate. Good supporting work from Timothy Hutton, James Belushi and Tom Wilkinson. Let me get back to Polanski who is the Master Director here and excellent work by Aexandre Desplat. The visuals are breathtaking and perfect for the sombre mood of the script. The music is a perfect fit to this suspensul cocktail of a tale.",1283385600,,1174,4.649038461538462
4131996,4,B003JZCVR8,"Within the first five minutes, if you watch the characters talk in the book publishing office, you will gain an appreciation of how Polanski uses casting to relay the message of this movie.  I won't give it away, but look at race, age, and accent, and you may be able to decipher subtle metaphors of how different countries stand in relation to each other today.

Down to the two Asian caretakers who are sweeping up the mess even as the wind blows.

I've been a fan of Polanski's work, ever since his first jazzy, beat Knife in the Water in 1962.  As with that film - this exiled director returns to a taut, tension-strung method of story telling.  In the extra, he himself references Raymond Chandler, whose signature is that sense of the diabolical, lying just beneath an uneasy calm.  There are no huge car chases with exploding barriers and Parkour jumps across buildings, the CGI is reserved for static backdrops (window vistas) and scenery color.

A noteworthy ensemble, combined with Polish cinematographer Pawel Edelman's (The Life Before Her Eyes) gorgeous steel grey landscape, and Alexandre Desplat's Philip Glassian score complement each other.  McGregor's nameless ghost does make many careless albeit convincing mistakes as a writer who apparently has no clue about the company he is in - international espionage, CIA, etc.

4131997,4,B003JZCVR8,"Roman Polanski`s movies don`t ordinarily lend themselves to autobiographical insight. In The Ghostwriter Polanski dabbles at the edge of autobiography in the character of Adam Lang, a former British Prime Minister exiled from England and subject to arrest in most of the world due to war crime accusations. Perhaps it is this convergence of art and autobiography that lead to Polanski's recent legal developments.

Ewan McGregor is a ghostwriter to Pierce Brosnan's Adam Lang who is facing war crimes charges in the Hague. McGregor is hired as a ""ghost"" to rewrite Lang's memoirs after the accidental death of the previous ghostwriter. McGregor inadvertently finds evidence that the death of his predecessor wasn't so accidental and they've both stumbled upon a secret of Lang's early political career that would cast a different shadow on his legacy as Prime Minister.

This is a thriller that isn't based all on action, car chases, shootouts, or explosions. It's a thriller that pulls you in because of the intrigue of the characters and the events that are created by them or are pulled into. The two male leads of McGregor and Brosnan are two excellent performances. McGregor gives a nuanced performance as ""the ghost"" as the only name he's given in the movie, a slightly disheveled writer who doesn't know what he's gotten himself into. Brosnan is right on as the former Prime Minister. A man who has had days in power, but still has the self-possessed confidence and retains the subliminal air of authority that everybody looks to when he enters the room. Kim Cattrall is a surprise as Amelia Bly, Lang's assistant. Even though it's suggested that she may have been or is Lang's lover, Cattrall shows here that she can play more than the sexpot or coquette that she has played in ""Sex and The City."" Timothy Hutton is good as he is in almost anything he does and it's too bad his part wasn't larger. Eli Wallach has a cameo as a crotchety old man who gets McGregor's ghost to start questioning what's going on.

The Ghostwriter isn't a flashy thriller that throws special effects, or car chases at you. As a matter of fact the only would be car chase is aborted because `the ghost' pulls his car off the road and lets the chasing car pass him. The intrigue and thrilling elements are delivered by the situation these characters find themselves in and how the events occur and how the characters struggle to find the resolution to the puzzle.

The DVD bonus features are minimal but give you a nice look inside the production of The Ghostwriter. They include an interview with screenwriter Robert Harris on how he came upon the idea of The Ghostwriter and how it evolved into its final form. A 10 minute interview with the major cast members about their characters, and an interview with Polanski on what he saw in The Ghostwriter.",1282867200,,2836,4.805327868852459

Disappointing to see Liam Neeson involved in this; we love his Long Way motorcycles movies.

The acting is spot on. It's a rare day I don't see who is who in a film, but this one kept me guessing.  Add a fun, intriguing mystery and unbelievable settings, and you've got a class film.

4132001,2,B003JZCVR8,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***

  I was disappointed in 'The Ghost Writer' since Roman Polanski did such a fine job with the excellent Holocaust drama, 'The Pianist'. What could have possessed Polanski to choose his material from 'The Ghost', a cheap shot novel from hack writer Robert Harris? The answer is obvious: Polanski has a grudge against the United States since they barred him from returning after he was accused of raping an underage girl back in the 70s.

  'The Ghost Writer' starts off rather nicely. A car on a ferry remains unclaimed after all the other cars have driven off. We soon find out that the car belonged to Mike McAra, a long-term assistant of former British Prime Minister Adam Lang (Pierce Brosnan). Mike is found dead, washed up on Martha's Vineyard beach where Lang has been vacationing with his wife, Ruth (Olivia Williams). Lang's assistant was helping him write his memoirs and now Lang's publishing company must hire a ghost writer to help the former Prime Minister complete the manuscript.

  The ghost writer (who remains unnamed throughout the movie and is referred to as 'The Ghost') is played by Ewan McGregor who arrives on Martha's Vineyard in the midst of a burgeoning scandal. It seems that the International Court at the Hague has accused Lang of ordering the torture of suspected terrorists while he was in office. Novelist Harris failed to do his research regarding legal protocol/regulations at the Hague. According to Wikipedia, ""handing British citizens over to the CIA to be tortured (in one case to death) -- would probably not be deemed a war crime or a crime against humanity by the International Criminal Court, as the acts were not ""committed as part of a policy that is executed on a wide scale"". In the DVD commentary, Harris admits he got the torture idea from watching a news report. Is this really the most original and clever idea that could have been utilized to propel the story along?

  While Harris admits that Lang has some attributes of the real-life Tony Blair, he denies that his character is supposed to be a model for the former Prime Minister. Whether he's the model or not, one thing remains clear: both Harris and Polanski blame Blair for his association with George Bush, who is linked to accusations of torture of prisoners. To my mind, I always thought that Tony Blair was a liberal/progressive, but the association with Bush not only sullies his reputation in the eyes of these militant left-wingers, but turns him into some kind of war criminal. At least Harris/Polanski allow their Blair stand-in, Lang, to defend himself from the outrageous implication that he is a war criminal but the subsequent turns in the plot point to where their true sympathies lie.

  McGregor's ghostwriter begins uncovering clues, possibly left by Lang's predecessor in the manuscript itself, that Lang is linked to the CIA. It appears that the CIA already is aware that there is some kind of secret code in the book, but they're either watching the ghostwriter to make sure he doesn't figure it out or allowing him to uncover the code for them. That's why so many unlikely events occur: Mike's room remains uncleaned and not searched and the Ghost finds some pictures of Lang from his days at Cambridge in the 70s, leading to clues that he may be associated with the CIA; The Ghost so easily finds his way to Emmet's house as the GPS is still programmed in the car; The Ghost so easily escapes from the clutches of two men who have been following in a car; and the assassin so easily is able to assassinate Lang despite the security protection (the implication is that the CIA makes a deal with the bitter father, who blames Lang for his son's death, allowing him access to the terminal roof).

  Perhaps the weakest part of 'The Ghost Writer' is the idea that the Ghost uncovers Emmet's association with the CIA merely by googling him on the internet. Big secret! And then there's the ridiculous finale where Amelia informs the Ghost, echoing opposition leader Rycart's earlier revelation, that ""it's all there at the beginning"". The Ghost figures it out that Lady MacBeth-like 'Ruth' is a CIA agent and has been influencing her husband for years. It turns out Lang is merely a 'patsy' and initially doesn't accept Mike's warning that Ruth has been up no good. Later, the Ghost reveals to Lang on the plane that Mike betrayed him, by telling Rycart about Ruth.

  The idiotic belief that the CIA uniformly consists of a bunch of cold-blooded murderers is reflective of the anti-American attitude in Europe today. Accusations of conspiracies are thick in the air despite no proof whatsoever. And here in 'The Ghost Writer', the CIA, in the form of a Machiavellian woman, will stoop to murder at any cost. If you are unable to refrain from bashing the CIA, it might be better to view them not as sinister characters, but more as a bunch of ineffectual bureaucrats, whose main source of 'intelligence', is what they can garner (along with anyone else) from the internet.

  Due to the prohibition of Polanski being allowed back in the U.S., most of the exterior shots were filmed in Germany. Polanski manages to extract some decent performances from his actors (although Kim Cattall's so-called British accent, has some rough patches). The problem with 'The Ghost Writer' is not in its characters or even its smart dialogue. Rather, it suffers from an incredible and ludicrous plot coupled with that anti-American sensibility. Behind it all is a naive Utopian presumption that we can all get along despite the presence of international terrorism--that is, a group of people who are bent on destroying all those who don't conform to their radical, fanatical ideology.",1282348800,8,5736,4.853483606557377

I guess that they were just supporting his legal stance with the USA for a crime that the so called victim did not want to pursue. I'm surprised that the great director of ""China Town"" and ""Rosemary Baby"" to name a few directed this peace of garbage. The ending was a let down.

Like that earlier film, this one plummets a civilian into international intrigue where he is left to shift for himself. He has to use all his ingenuity and wiles to evade the conspiracy that he feels taking shape around him. He senses danger at every turn, but since he isn't sure what door it's coming in through, he can't be sure which door to leave by.

There are major stars in this film who play their parts brilliantly. Tom Wilkinson is chilling in his portrayal of civilized menace. Pierce Brosnan does a wonderful job as the ex-Prime Minister whose hearty manner increasingly seems to be a mask he wears to hide ruthlessness.

The only problem is - the stakes in this game are hardly high enough to warrant all the characters' sinister maneuvering. In ""Torn Curtain,"" Newman and Andrews were up against the concerted forces of the deadly Cold War competition. Secrets about new atomic weapons were at stake. Here the forces being arrayed against Ewan McGregor's character are motivated by a desire to either make or break the ex-Prime Minister's reputation. One faction is working to make a cause celebre of his orders to have four suspected terrorists water-boarded in order to force them to reveal their connections. The opposing faction is working to cover-up this ugly aspect of his regime in order to protect his place in history and his Party's chances in the next round of elections.

Ordering the torture of detainees is certainly reprehensible, but it's hardly the stuff of international intrigue. As McGregor makes his way through this contrived danger and tries to ghost write an autobiography for the ex-Prime Minister that is neither a fluff piece nor unintentionally incriminating - he does begin to find that the over-shadowing conspiracy has a root system larger than the single issue of the treatment of detainees. But this larger issue turns out to supply an even less convincing reason for murderous plotting. This international game of poker with nothing convincing at stake then devolves into a completely trumped up exercise.

Without Nazis or KGB, or without directly invoking terrorist infiltration - modern political thrillers have a hard time conjuring up realistic threats. So this movie is a snow globe, a shining example of acting, dialogue, and cinematography, all encasing a harmless miniature of motive. But if you can just imagine those bygone blocs and inject some sense of the threat they posed into this plot, you can enjoy the craft of this film.

Plus, it has an authentically inventive, poignant ending.",1281916800,,2686,5.026966292134832
4132007,3,B003JZCVR8,"It is perhaps because of the fervency with which I was looking forward to this movie that I am now declare disappointment with Ghost Writer.

Who would blame me? There are quite a few recommending features: good actors, an interesting mystery and a good director who raises the viewer's interest level right out of the gate: an empty car on a ferry and a body washes up on grey, storming beach!

Who? Why? How? These questions are raised but tantalizingly go unanswered as we watch Ewan McGregor's reluctance for taking up a new job, which only heightens the effect: what's going on with ex-British PM Brosnan and why did the ghost writer before McGregor (whose character--McGregor's--interestingly, is never actually named) die under mysterious circumstances and will history be repeated?

The wind-swept island setting in which The Ghost (as McGregor is called) ends up is gorgeously somber, enhancing the general foreboding atmosphere as the tale weaves in and out, throwing various clues that leads the viewer seemingly everywhere but at the truth, punctuated by events that effectively shake up the picture. Unfortunately, the truth is where this movie falters.

Unlike my wife and much to my dismay, I'm never good at predicting the end of movies, but this one's was particularly easy from about two-thirds of the way in and it's pathetic. Unfortunately, it seems in his zeal to paint UK-US relationships with the master-slave brush, Polanski stumbles over what could have been a truly intense story and grabs this pale reflection instead.

Three stars for the gorgeous scenery, the wonderful beach house and the great acting (with the exception of the unfortunate Kim Cattrall).",1281916800,9,1685,5.135036496350365

I was so disappointed by the lack of tension and the preponderance of cliches in this film. Pierce Brosnan was good as a Tony Blair-like Prime Minister, but Ewan McGregor gets my vote as one of the most bland and colorless movie stars out there. Kim Cattrell's character didn't make much sense. I didn't care for any of the characters and the denouement was interesting but the ending just fell flat to me (like McGregor's body). Some parts of the film dragged on to the point where I was falling asleep (Ewan talks. Brosnan talks. They talk some more. Then more talk.) Was Polanski too worried about his upcoming trial in the U.S. to make a good, suspenseful thriller? I felt he was uncommonly restrained in what should have been a nail-biting thriller. Oh well...I guess even great directors have bad days.",1281916800,3,920,4.615853658536586

With Director Roman Polanski, it took me back to his 1974 classic ""Chinatown"" where he not only directed, but had a cameo part roughing up private eye Jack Nicholson.

Here we move up to near current events, with a Tony Blair type person trying to set the record straight re the Iraq war, rendition, torture, etc.  Come to think of it, these concerns are still with us. But the Blair person in the movie hopes for a new biography to clear his name.

A ghost writer comes in to try and polish the work of a previous ghost writer who ran into severe difficulties. He gets a month to polish the draft, then a new deadline of two weeks
This would be a very tough job for any writer, but add some romance and almost daily challenges and turns.

Pierce Brosnan plays the Blair role, and I told my wife I thought he did a great job.
She remained focused on Polanski's legal problems, which is a good point. But can't we just look at his recent work with this movie and let the legal system work its wonders?

I think you will enjoy this movie, especially if you are a mystery fan. We just do not get many movie mysteries like this. I hope Hollywood and the Independents come out with many more.",1281830400,,1303,4.297959183673469

In this particular case, to put the blu-ray edition on one side, and the DVD version on the other.

I prefer to get only the blu-ray version (in what I'm interested) instead of getting both on one disc.

4132011,5,B003JZCVR8,"Roman Polanski's The Ghost Writer is a great thriller in the vein of Alfred Hitchcock's The Man Who Knew Too Much or North by Northwest; This is a god send due the garbage being made today.

Ewan McGregor stars as a writer who replaces a recently deceased ""ghost writer"" who was working on the memoirs of a contriversal former British Prime Minister named Adam Lang, played in good spirit by Pierce Brosnan. Mc Gregor's character was brilliantly written because you feel his place in the world as an anonymous person, you actually never learn his name during the entire film. McGregor gets caught up in Lang's quest to not only preserve his legacy for prosperity but also fight political scandal; The film shows the power of words in the game of politics and in an ego-maniac's case, it never ends.

I also adore the settings of the film, everything is purposely cold and disdant and McGregor is essentially swimming in shark infested waters and never knows where the danger comes from. One of Polanski's great trade marks is always to have the main protagonist caught in sort of an existential box in which the character can't seem to escape.

The film builds to a gripping climax when Mcgregor investigates Lang's possible connections to the CIA and is hunted down by people who don't want him to find out; At one point a brilliantly staged low-speed chase occurs. Again, this is a welcome change from the standard thrillers of conspiracy without substance, characterization, and usually has everything occuring in public view as opposed to into the shadows.

Whether it's Woody Allan now cheering an Israel/Jew-hating Obama, or Roman imagining the CIA to be this incredible evil, it's shocking that these movies continue to be made. The fact that someone might have been with the CIA in his youth, and that BRAINWASHED characters do their bidding (to freedom's detriment, apparently) - distorts the natural kinship the few Western countries still have against terrorism. The great Golem, the CIA.

That being said, the pacing is very fast and good, and much of the dialogue is intelligent. It's just the plot assumption that isn't. It's like the woman who has you breathless at first glance, leaving you to find later with 'the-morning-after' that the hair extensions, silicone in the super-bra, padding-in-the-panties, hot-outfit and make-up gave you the ""wrong"" impression.

Here, the ASSUMPTION Polanski makes is that the audience will also be horrified to find that America's intelligence agency has similar goals to that of a British PM.  Roman shouldnt worry. Between Carter's Church Commission (1970s), which pulled the CIA's teeth and paved the way for Bin Laden, or the left-wing Clinton Stooge now in charge and further weakening that once-great agency, the CIA has also imploded, making room for transvestites, Jew-haters and muslim-terrorist protectors prancing down their once patriotic halls.",1281744000,8,1414,5.331838565022421

4132014,4,B003JZCVR8,"This is a spy movie for adults, and one of the best I ever saw. That being said, this is a mixed review, because while I would not have missed seeing this movie once, I would not want to own it. The movie is a masterpiece of intrigue and atmosphere.  It lacks the cheap attention getters of wild car chases,  excessive foul language, needless bloody gore, and over blown, explicit sex scenes that have nothing to do with the story, for which I am very grateful. I won't deal with the details of the plot, as other reviewers have gone into it, and both the positive and negative reviews describe the story very well.  The story moves our hero, the ghostwriter, through an entire series of events, as he starts out investigating the unexpected death of the writer who had the job before him.  He discovers a huge conpiracy involving the CIA, British politics, CIA sleeper agents, America placing British leaders in their postions of power, and making sure that anyone who gets in the way meets a bad end.  (Personally, I think that if the CIA was really this good at their jobs, we would not be in the world state that we are in right now.)  The plot is interesting and involving, and draws the watcher into it, along with the hero.  You have the feeling that this could really happen to any ordinary person, to you, or someone you know.  The ghostwriter finds himself swept up into events far too large for him to deal with, leaving him with no one he can trust or turn to.  What is disturbing is that he is the only character in the story with good intentions.  Everybody else either has their own agenda or doesn't give a damn. Unfortunately the ghostwriter tries his best to do the right thing, and his good intentions get him killed in the end. That's a little too close to reality for my comfort.  Although I did not really like the ending, it fit the flow of the story and gave added dramatic impact to the story.  VERY well worth watching, but it would not be a favorite that I would watch often.",1281484800,2,2002,4.4103260869565215

4132016,1,B003JZCVR8,"The Ghost Writer is a propaganda film by Roman Polanski in the form of a triller. The film makes two points: one is that the CIA and the USA are ruthless, evil and criminal; and the other that the British Prime Minister is a CIA plant since his early twenties. Were it not for the PM doing the CIA's bidding, Britain would not have been America's ally in foreign policy matters, including the Missile Defense Initiative.
Although the premise that a top government official is a plant and working against his own country is interesting, the persistent CIA/USA bashing gets tiresome. The acting is OK, there is some suspense, but it is not a clever story. The CIA is clever enough to control a country's leader and thus, policy, yet their agents can be found on Google. There are other very dumb things. There is no escaping the feeling that Polanski, who co-wrote the screenplay with Harris, hates America and will use his position to brainwash people.",1281398400,16,951,4.700598802395209
4132017,2,B003JZCVR8,"Somehow the British creative class have convinced themselves that the former labor Prime Minister, Tony Blair, overwhelmingly popular and elected twice, was some sort of lapdog for President Bush.  Probably closer to the other way round.  In fact, the American CIA was no lapdog of the former president, and never missed an opportunity to publicly undermine his policies, including issuing a ludicrous National Intelligence Estimate in 2007 arguing that Iran had suspended its nuclear weapons program in 2003 and had probably not restarted it.

The fever-swamp fantasy that Blair was Bush's lapdog forms the basis of this leaden ""thriller"" from child-rapist Roman Polanski.  Even in my flu-addled condition, I could see the big plot twist coming about half an hour before the ghost writer figured it out, by googling and by finding a poorly hidden cipher in a manuscript.  I'm sorry, but this was not a good movie on any level.  To make matters worse, they had Brits playing Americans, and Americans playing Brits, none of which worked.

It has to be one of Pierce Brosnan's best performances on screen.

Another excellent player in the movie is the weather.  It sets the tone in various scenes, drizzles, rain, storm and everything in between. What a beautiful movie to watch, again and again. Will definitely own the DVD.",1281312000,5,593,4.453703703703703
4132019,4,B003JZCVR8,"Actually, the first time I saw this film I did not think much of it, and by the end, I said to myself; is that all!!?? Well, I must not have been paying attention, or in a bad mood or something, because the second time I saw it, WOW! This is an incredible work of cinema.

The film has an eerie sense of foreboding in nearly every frame.
Lang's home looks like a bunker, and the grounds are lifeless and bleak.
When we meet the major players, there is a tension in the air that we can't quite put our finger on.

This tension builds slowly in layers with Polanski using the actors, their dialog, the buildings, the sets, the pacing, the gloomy atmosphere etc. to create a feeling that something is not quite right.
The memoires themselves seem to have a life of their own, they are a character in the narative.

Polanski said this movie is for adults, he is not kidding.
It's clear that he did not have the American under 25 age group in mind.
There are no explosions, car chases, gun battles, fast close-up cutting, jitter-cam or any of the modern Hollywood gimmicks used as cues to elicit tension and manipulate audience reactions.
Polanski uses slow and deliberate pacing as he layers the narrative. Pay particularly close attention to Pierce Brosnan's performance in the beginning of the film, his demeanor, body language and dialog.

A foreboding atmosphere permeates the entire film.
As an added touch, the ghost writer is never named, and the dialog cleverly tip-toes around it, even to the point of throwing in a little wry humor; ""and who are you""? Lang asks, ""I am your ghost""!
Lang refers to his ghost writer as ""man"", ""he always says that when he can't remember someone's name"".

There is a stark realism to this film, everything is logical and all the story pieces fit together in a way that could actually happen.
This is not a ""larger than life"" farfetched action thriller yarn.

The film is loaded with subtle clues and nuances' in the acting, and the final 30 minutes is sheer cinematic gold. Reminisant of Hitchcock at his best. The scene where the note is passed from person to person until it is finally read by Mrs. Lang is wonderful. This is the work of a master filmmaker.

Don't be too put off if you don't like it the first time, it's the kind of film that you really need to pay attention to everything. The second time around it will make perfect sense.
Polanski dots every ""I' and crosses every ""t"", the film seems uncomfortably real leaving no gaps of logic.
The ending is ironic genius.

At the end, I felt as though this could actually happen, and the implications are staggering.",1281312000,,2611,4.552238805970149
4132020,4,B003JZCVR8,"This movie has a lot of positive points to it that made it worth watching.  First, the acting was well done.  Pierce Brosnan, Kim Cattrall, Ewan McGregor, and Olivia Williams play characters who are complex, mysterious, and delightfully hard to predict.  Secondly, the ambiance of the film is spot-on.  The bleak atmosphere is foreboding and unsettling with its stark cinematography and the feeling like your every move is being watched from the opening scene.  Lastly, the plot is full of murky twists and turns that keep you guessing what will happen through the very last scene.  Add all of these things together and you end up with a movie that makes you feel nervous, uncomfortable, and agitated - just like a good political thriller should.

The story begins when a ghost writer, hired to write the memoirs for a former British Prime Minister, washes up dead on the shores of Martha's Vineyard.  Things only get more dangerous and bizarre when a second ghost writer is hired to finish the job and finds a trail of strange clues that his predecessor left behind. What's eventually uncovered is an intricate plot involving murder, terrorism, and the CIA.

I enjoyed the somber musical score that Mr. Polanski used throughout the film.  The Ghost Writer has the feel and mood of an early 1990's movie like The Russia House, a type of film from yesteryear that has more depth and less superficiality than what Hollywood films presently are about.  I was eager for The Ghost Writer to come out on DVD and am very pleased.  Also a fan of Mr. Roman Polanski as a filmmaker.  This is one of the better films of the year in its style and substance.

What most impresses me here is the sense of feeling WATCHED, right along with the protagonist. In one memorable instance, a conversation on the beach is filmed from a point of view that places the silent bodyguard at the center of the frame as he follows his charges, so that even though he's in the background and does nothing to call attention to himself, this minor character becomes central to the scene. For these few moments, it's impossible not to watch the watcher; his anonymous presence becomes as ominous as whatever unseen dangers it averts.

He suspects not all is well but it takes a few discoveries to determine that there is more to the memoirs than just names and dates.  He may not be an invective reporter but he is too nosy to let it go. What he cannot let go of could very well mean his life. Then again, maybe it will all work out for the best. We get to discover the layers of mystery together with the ghostwriter. We also get to tell him to ""stay in the car"" but does he ever listen.

The movie is formula and politically charged. Yet we get to enjoy the suspense without a lot of blood and gore, no excess of explicative's or over cranked chase scenes. Roman Polanski seems to have mellowed out in his old age. Watching the movie, a second time will reveal the clues that were not blatant or masked.

I like the review of old actors in this presentation. I was surprised to see Eli Wallach. Aside from Kim Cattrall's accent, she was believable.  Once Pierce Brosnan left those bond movies he also has become pretty good and fit the part in this film. I first became aware of Ewan McGregor from ""Angels & Demons"" then I remember seeing him around in a retroactive since; He can make expressions that speak better than words.

Alan Lang, former British PM who suspiciously keeps making decisions that favor America, is going to be investigated by the Hague for turning over suspected terrorists to the CIA, under whose custody one of them dies. This makes Lang a ""murderer"" and potentially, in the bizarre world of the UN, where Iran and Libya are on human-rights councils, a war criminal.

The whole film is basically a fantasy-cum-coverup expose, where his ghostwriter finds out the secret behind the demise of his predecessor. It's got touches of quirky humor here and there, and a sedate chase scene or two, but otherwise kind of a slow ride. Alan Lang is basically a stand-in for George W. Bush, whom many want to see prosecuted for ""war crimes"" in Iraq, etc. The whole film assumes that Lang's actions do in fact make him a war criminal, so be prepared for a liberal dose of that type of er, opinion. No pun intended. It's always fun, though, to watch Britishisms, which do come out in the course of conversation, well done in understated fashion by all around.

Surprisingly, there are little touches of balance. The ghostwriter jokes that he is about to be killed by a peace protester, reminding us that most calls to violence today emanate from the compassionate American left (the compassionate, giving Left being a myth debunked by a surprised Arthur C.

Later, Lang makes a good point to the sanctimonious ghostwriter, who regards it as beneath him to work for a war criminal such as Lang. If Lang were still in power, he would make two lines at airports - one where everyone was security-checked, and one where no one was, and let's see which one his critics would put their kids on. I was shocked that this was included in the movie, but it helped make it slightly more palatable.

4132031,4,B003JZCVR8,"Despite some obvious plot holes (finding a CIA mole link by simply googling the guy?), Ghost Writer benefits from a fine script, pleasantly low-key direction, a wonderful lack of violence, and a very solid and understated performance from Ewan McGregor.

Even Brosnan acts well here, not always the case, and Williams is also convincing. In fact, all the acting is good, which one can credit Polanski for, famous for being an actors' director. He clearly knows how to make his actors comfortable, and by giving them good material to work with paves the way for quality. The plot is excellent, and Harris' book gets a good treatment here. The overall idea is well worth considering, and part of this movie's appeal is indeed its willingness to confront various political realities most of us would rather not think about.

I'm not sure if it's because of his getting busted for the rape charge (or vice-versa), but Polanski has made a few of the better conspiracy-shaping-American-history movies, most notably of course Chinatown. I've always wondered about his getting busted in LA, the town that Chinatown exposes as full of cheating, scheming politicians and businessmen. Was the bust an act of revenge from LA's power elite? Was it a set-up or was Polanski doing what he was accused of? There are few popular movies that expose LA like that one, and only one director who's not allowed back in America. Quite a coincidence in any case.

Maybe Polanksi made Ghost Writer mainly to slam hypocrisy in the land that still wants to jail him? One thing for sure, the plot's central theme---that our leaders could stand trial for war crimes for the torturing done in Iraq by the CIA---can't sit well with Cheney, W, Blair and the boys. A little too close to home, and all too legally accurate. Most reviews shy away from this fact, but it's the central theme of the movie, and one well worth considering at length.

I think this film will wear very well as the years go by, and perhaps be seen as prescient. It's certainly Hitchcockian in many good ways, and Polanski's refusal to fill the screen with bullets and blood, instead choosing subtle moments and plenty of quiet face time with good actors at the top of their games, McGregor most of all, is simply intelligent filmmaking.",1281052800,,2278,4.803571428571429

In essence, the USA is the implausible villian in this piece and it really grates on one's nerves to see such a biased account of a nunaced issue that is a life and death concern for all of us. Then again, it's Roman Polanksi, and his antagonism towards this country is well-know.  So.. it winds up as a well-acted propaganda piece that will met with the approval of the many viewers who may share its jaundiced world view.",1281052800,2,557,4.5049504950495045
4132033,4,B003JZCVR8,"This fine political drama is based on the book ""The Ghost"" by Robert Harris, and its storyline features the Hitchcockian theme of an ordinary man caught up in an overwhelmingly difficult situation -to be more specific, in a web of political intrigue.  The ghostwriter is ably played by Ewan McGregor who blends seriousness with humor. McGregor is outstanding because the whole movie revolves around his character.  The viewer identifies with him and cares about what happens to him. (Interestingly, the character of the ghostwriter is not given a name.)

A. Brief Synopsis

The ghostwriter is hired to rewrite the memoirs of ex-British Prime Minister Adam Lang after the first ghostwriter mysteriously dies.  As the ghostwriter digs in deeper into the memoirs, he starts to uncover some of the secrets of the Lang character, who is accused of being a war criminal and a puppet of the United States.  Pierce Brosnan does a superb job of portraying a charismatic and dynamic leader who finds it challenging to deal with the aftermath of stepping out of a powerful political office.  This is one of Brosnan's best post-007 performances.

Meanwhile, the ghostwriter meets the two women who are most important in Lang's life -- his politically savvy wife, Ruth (Olivia Williams) and Lang's administrative assistant Amelia Bly (Kim Cattrall).  The most interesting character for me was Ruth. Olivia Williams captures the many different sides of this complex and intelligent woman, who loves her husband but who also hates him, and finds it very difficult to deal with some of the choices he makes.  Kim Cattrall (in a role which is vastly different to Samantha in the Sex & the City series) plays Amelia Bly, the loyal assistant to the Prime Minister, who becomes like a second wife to Adam Lang.  Some of the most interesting parts in the movie are the dagger-like dialogues (more like verbal sparring) between Ruth and Amelia. They clearly hate each other but they have to cover it up and look civil in front of the ghostwriter.

The ghostwriter tries to uncover the truth of how the former ghostwriter dies, and Lang's political background and ties.  Meanwhile, the memoirs of Adam Lang become a central character in the movie and takes a life of its own.

As the ghostwriter tries to get behind the truth of the allegations against Adam Lang, he finds himself at great peril as powerful political figures will stop at nothing to prevent him from discovering the truth.  Although this movie starts out rather slowly, it gathers momentum and builds up to a very interesting and surprising climax.  Enough said.  You'll have to watch the movie for yourself.

B.  DVD Features

Special Features:

I enjoyed these 3 featurettes:

1) Documentary:  The Ghost Writer: Fiction or Reality -- author Robert Harris talks about his novel and what inspired him to come up with the story after looking at Tony Blair's life in office and after seeing a real-life story of another British leader accused of being a war criminal.  Harris comments about his meaningful collaboration with director Roman Polanski.

2) The Cast of the Ghost Writer:  The stars in the film (Ewan MacGregor, Pierce Brosnan, Olivia Williams, Kim Cattrall) all talk about their positive experiences in making this movie and in working with Roman Polanski.

3) Interview with Roman Polanski:  Polanski talks about his interest in turning Harris' book into a movie and his collaboration with Harris as a co-screenwriter and director of the movie.  He talks about his casting choices, his work with the director of photography, how he designed the Lang house, and how he developed the manuscript.  It was a very interesting interview.

Bottom Line:  It is more of a political intrigue movie rather than a political thriller (and that's why I deleted one star).  It is not a Tom Clancy ""Jack Ryan"" sort of movie with lots of action or a John Le Carre movie like ""The Tailor of Panama"" (with Pierce Brosnan).  If you're looking for that, you'd be disappointed.  It is a satisfying political intrigue-drama with a twist of Hitchcock. Even though the story is different, this movie is more similar in feel and pacing with the earlier Roman Polanski film ""Frantic"" (1988), another Hitchcockian film starring Harrison Ford.  I appreciated the rich character development and the well-written, intelligent script in ""The Ghost Writer.""  They don't make many movies like this today.",1280966400,5,4426,4.997267759562842
4132034,5,B003JZCVR8,"The slow-boil thriller is a genre that I immediately respond to and Roman Polanski is certainly the master. With ""The Ghost Writer"" he crafts, what I believe, to be his best film next to ""Chinatown"". With crackling suspense, spot on acting, and a plot that is always compelling, relevant, and well told, you get one of 2010's finest films. The picture is so well made (expert cinematography, a memorable score, snappy editing) that it's almost unbelievable. Roman Polanski is back and in top form.",1280966400,3,497,4.928571428571429
4132035,3,B003JZCVR8,"""The Ghost Writer"" is an adaptation of Robert Harris' political thriller ""The Ghost"", written for the screen by Harris and director Roman Polanski while the novel was still in progress. An unnamed writer (Ewan McGregor) is hired to put the finishing touches on the memoirs of former British Prime Minister Adam Lang (Pierce Brosnan) after the ghostwriter who was working on the project drowns. The new Ghost qualifies for the job, against the objections of his editor, by being fast, British, best-selling, and completely oblivious to politics. He heads to Martha's Vineyard in the United States, where Lang is living while a scandal brews in Europe. Lang's former Foreign Secretary Richard Rycart (Robert Pugh) has accused Lang of authorizing the illegal handover of terrorist suspects for torture by the CIA. The International Criminal Court is investigating Lang for war crimes and human rights violations.

The Ghost steps into Lang's modernist beach house and into a world of politics and intrigue that he does not understand. He's just there to transform Lang's words into punchy prose. But things get dicey when he begins to investigate some leads that his predecessor had apparently followed to his death. The first hour of the film is striking in the number of extraneous shots and scenes that run too long. Tightening it up would have cured the excessive length. The cast is impressive in the depth and breadth of its talent, but the acting style is almost parody at times. I think that Polanski is invoking crime melodramas of the mid-20th century. But it doesn't work here, as not one of the characters comes across as a real person. That's an impediment when you're trying to comment on, or at least allude to, current events. The most obvious case is Kim Cattrall's kittenish portrayal of Lang's assistant Amelia. It's pure caricature and seems incongruous with her lines -which she delivers in an unidentifiable accent.

Worse, the story doesn't make sense. The Ghost suspects that he is in danger, but he trusts everyone without reason, as if he has a death wish. The plot relies on people knowing things that they shouldn't logically know. It's badly written. People don't act this way, and the story is not self-contained. It runs too long. It doesn't make sense. Characters are over-the-top when they should be compelling. Olivia Williams, who plays Lang's wife Ruth, is 15 years younger than Pierce Brosnan, when part of the mystery hinges on them having met when they were young. The interiors of Lang's beach house were filmed on a set, as was necessary because of lighting. But the huge glass windows never have any sand, rain, or reflections on them. They're perfectly clear, as if they don't exist. A minor point, but I found it distracting. Why even 3 stars? ""The Ghost Writer"" is an entertaining mess. As long as you don't' think about it, it will entertain you as it goes along, though probably not in the end.

The DVD (Summit Entertainment 2010): There are 3 featurettes on the disc. ""The Ghost Writer: Fiction or Reality?"" (10 min) interviews author Robert Harris about the evolution of the book, characters, and his collaboration with Polanski. ""The Cast of The Ghost Writer"" (11 min) interviews co-producer Timothy Burrill and the principle cast about working with Polanski and about performances. In ""An Interview with Roman Polanski""  (8 min), the director talks about his interest in the project, casting, the set, the ending. Subtitles are available for the film in English SDH and Spanish.

4132036,5,B003JZCVR8,"THE GHOST WRITER begins in medias res -  no credits, no lead in, just a dead body lying along the coast of either Cape Cod or Martha's Vineyard, and this creepy beginning remains the tenor throughout this very smart and very gripping drama based on the book 'The Ghost' by Robert Harris as adapted for the screen by the author and by the director Roman Polanski (the Cape Cod/Martha's Vineyard scenes were shot in Germany due to the political decisions about Polanski's being in the US).  This is one of those films, thankfully, that requires full attention for its 128 minute duration, as every word of the dialog is meaningful and additive to the plot/conundrum of the story.

Adam Lang (Pierce Brosnan) is the British Prime Minister, electing to live in the US with his wife Ruth (Olivia Williams) and crew including his personal secretary Amelia (Kim Cantrall) while the media and the public in England is outraged at the news that Lang has allegedly turned over suspected terrorists to the CIA, a move that includes the dastardly water torture rendition.  Lang is in the process of writing his memoirs with a ghost writer who just happens to be the man we saw dead in the surf at films opening.  On the mainland agent Rick Ricardelli (Jon Bernthal) convinces one of his clients to be the replacement for the dead ghost writer - the unnamed ghost is Ewan McGregor.  Reluctantly the new ghost travels out to the home of Lang and in studying the apparently inept memoir manuscript begins his re-write.  Slowly incidents occur that lead the ghost to information that all is not as it appears with Adam Lang: meetings with an apparent old Cambridge friend Paul Emmett (Tom Wilkinson), a wily old codger who has seen a lot on the beaches (Eli Wallach), and a time alone with Ruth while Lang is away with Amelia on a speaking tour to assuage the public hate are mixed with espionage like incidents and ultimately discoveries as to the truth about Lang. Ghost eventually breaks the code that is hidden in plain sight. It is a tight story and on that holds attention well for the long duration of the film.  There are some fine actors in small roles - James Belushi, Timothy Hutton, etc - and every detail of the script and acting is first rate. The cinematography by Pawel Edelman and the musical score by the superb Alexandre Desplat add greatly to the atmosphere. But it is the gift of Polanski that maintains the chilling tension so much a part of his directorial influence that makes this film memorable. The idea of the story is a terrifying concept that is too plausible for comfort and Polanski makes it work well.  Grady Harp, August 10",1280880000,,2641,4.662365591397849
4132037,1,B003JZCVR8,"As mentioned by previous reviewers, it's hard to take this movie serious since Google Search is the prime means of solving the mystery. Also, the ending is anticlimactic, and more of a cop out than anything else.",1280793600,5,212,4.756756756756757
4132038,4,B003JZCVR8,"It's been a while since Polanski has directed a straight-up thriller; THE PIANIST was a superb drama, but it hasn't been since THE NINTH GATE over a decade ago that we've had something taut and suspenseful.  And while THE GHOST WRITER isn't Polanski's best, or even his most suspenseful, it is indeed a superb film that resonates in today's culture.

The film follows a ghost writer (Ewen McGregor) as he is hired to write the memoirs of former Prime Minister Adam Lang (Pierce Brosnan).  After ensconcing himself in Lang's American retreat, and getting to know Lang's loyal secretary (Kim Cattrall) and wife (Olivia Williams), the Ghost (and the world) discover that Lang is being charged with war crimes.  Are they true?  And what exactly happened to Lang's previous ghost writer, who washed ashore a couple weeks ago?

What could easily have been a throw-away political thriller is, in the hands of Planski and novelist/screenwriter Robert Harris, a personal thriller.  Politics are clearly important here (there's no denying this is a Tony Blair allegory), but it's really about the Ghost; and as such, McGregor is forced to carry a lot of this film on his thankfully-capable shoulders.  He turns in a fine performance, one of his best.  Brosnan is surprisingly underused; ever since he cast aside the Bond tux, he's been turning out marvelous performances left and right.  Here's yet another, in the brief screen time he's given.  Cattrall is appropriately menacing; is she merely loyal, or something much worse?  And Olivia Williams is a stunner; her chemistry with McGregor doesn't quite click, but she is in fine-form, turning in a sultry, mysterious performance.

The film never entirely digs itself in.  Much as with Polanski's 80s thriller FRANTIC, we never get a real sense of the danger, despite the stellar script, direction, and performances; thus, the ending, while otherwise inevitable (and yet oddly satisfying), comes off as a bit hackneyed.  There's a claustrophobia that just isn't here; we don't feel the Ghost's world closing in upon him.  Still, THE GHOST WRITER is a great thriller from a fantastic director and writer.  It's not Polanski's best, but it's better than a lot of the political thriller wannabes out there.",1280793600,2,2244,5.070844686648502

And the really odd thing, no mention of all the deaths, rape and torture caused by terrorist, oh I'm sorry, man made disasters.

4132043,4,B003JZCVR8,"The ghost writer is truly a ghost writer, trying to write the autobiography of a former British prime minister, who is obviously Tony Blair.  The first ghost writer was murdered. In reading the first writer's manuscript and looking at his pictures, he finds that there is group of men who trace back to Cambridge college days.  The PM was one of them. Pierce Brosnan plays the PM and does so ably.  However, it's a good thing Ewan McGregor was aboard this film as the lead, the ghost writer.  I think a lesser actor would have been lost. This is because he is on his own for so much of the movie. He also is trying to solve most of the mystery at the core of the movie, which is: was the British PM an American stooge from day one of his political career? He does so in large part by shuffling papers, pictures, and clicking away on a computer.  This can be some pretty dull stuff in the wrong hands.

This is Roman Polanski's film.  It is NOT his ""China Town"" mystery by any means. I think Polanski is trying to emulate Hitchcock's work in this film but the result is not as successful as a Hitchcock film.  However, it is a good film with an interesting premise and Ewan McGregor is one of my favorite actors.

One warning: although this is a mystery film, I would not call it an action film.  If you are into the thrills and spills of an action film, this is not that kind of film.

4132044,5,B003JZCVR8,"Despite his personal life, I've always loved Roman Polanski's thrillers. I'll admit he's not always on the mark with movies but when he is he strikes gold. The Ghost writer, based on Robert Harris' novel (who also wrote the screenplay) is one of the best thrillers to come around in a long time.

The plot of Ghost Writer involes a nameless writer (an excellent McGregor) who's been hired to spend a month with a Tony Blair-ish former prime minister (perfectly cast Pierce Brosnan) and ghost-write his memoirs, replacing another biographer who died under mysterious circmstances. As our protagonist interviews the prime minister and his wife he ends up getting involved (in more ways than one) with them and uncovers political secrets, lies and cover-ups that threaten his own life. Like the novel the plot of the film sometimes flirts with the predictable, but it's always engaging and even manages to catch you off-guard with some surprising humor and insight into the creative writing process.

The cast in this film is both terrific and unexpected. It's been a while since Ewan McGregor and Pierce Brosnan have done a film worthy of note and they've never been better than in the Ghost Writer. Kim Cattral is surprisingly good (and surprisingly well-cast) as the Prime Minister's assistant. Olivia Williams is absolutely brilliant as the Prime Minister's long suffering wife. The rest of the cast is well chosen with Tom Wilkinson, Timothy Hutton and Eli Wallach. Even James Belushi is given a small but memorable role.

The Ghost Writer is also well filmed taking place mostly on an isolated estate. The sense of being shut off from the rest of the world is perfectly realized and the atmosphere really draws you into the story.

While the Ghost Writer may not be up there with Roman Polanski's classics like 'Knife in the Water', 'Chinatown' and 'Repulsion' it is one of the best films I've seen in this disappointing year and an easy must-see experience.",1279324800,6,1961,4.951367781155016

4132046,1,B003JZCVR8,"WARNING: SPOILERS

The best part is when the writer discovers the professor is in the CIA.  How? Google search! First page of the results! Remarkable.  The first ghost writer apparently didn't have a computer or I would think he would have left that clue rather than the photos.  ""He was in the CIA! TPlus he gets in the BMW and the nav system is still pointed at the CIA dude's house who, even though he is a CIA dude, hasn't got a convincing cover story for an operation he's been running and gets all blustery with McGregor immediately.  Also, the ""code"" is awesome, it's the first word of each chapter! Just like an Encyclopedia Brown mystery! Or maybe the Hardy Boys. How does Brosnan's enemy have time to pursue him in the UK and show up in Massachusetts to help McGregor?  The twist is? 'he's not in the CIA', 'she is!'.  Dumb.  I love that the damned paper manuscript is the key to the whole thing, he's just towing the thing around for ages.

I'm floored at the reviews.  There was maybe 60 minutes of movie here, plus 30 minutes of the 'thrilling' trip on the ferry and back.  I give four stars to Pierce Brosnan overacting.  The sex scene is inexplicable and once you know the ending, all of her behavior and motivation is equally so.  Atmosphere might be a plus if it wasn't so busy telegraphing the nefariousness of it all.

BTW the notion that a functioning UK government would ever hand up a former PM to a war crimes tribunal is nonsensical even in a dumb thriller.  Or that it's on the news ALL THE TIME IN THE US.  Polanski's been hiding out so long he doesn't remember we don't have international news on the TV EVER, we're too dumb and isolated.

At no point was this ever not a cartoon.  They never cleared out the old ghost writers stuff? Never cleared the nav system? The CIA managed to run a UK PM  for 30 years with no hiccup and then were found out in two days by a biographer? With one photo and a single Google search? Dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb.

The movie, too, takes the name of the US book release.  Shame that, because 'The Ghost' is a more apt title - Harris' trick is to never provide a name to the Ewan McGregor writer character...a feat Polanski pulls off as well.  The Ghost role was originally supposed to go to Nicolas Cage, but passed to McGregor.  That was a major upgrade - Cage has become a cartoon.  Harris' protagonist is short on ego and confidence and has a bit of marketing and Fleet Street in him.  McGregor is perfect.

Harris' book is a thinly veiled broadside at Tony Blair.  Harris had been a supporter of Blair's, but soured on him over Iraq.  Here's where the movie excels over the book: Pierce Brosnan's Adam Lang is positively Blair-ian down to his fiber.  No less subtle is Harris' depiction of Lang's wife, Ruth, as shrewish and scheming (and more), pretty much hitting and playing up the worst rumors of Cherie Blair's behind-the-scenes role at 10 Downing St.  The Blairs can't be at all happy with this portrayal, most notably with Harris' denouement as it comes to the Adam Lang character.  And, if anything, Polanski's version is even more shocking as it comes to its treatment of Lang in the end.  It seems almost incendiary.

I enjoyed the film a bit less than the book.  The book's tone is superb.  I was hooked right from the first line - ""The moment I heard how McAra died, I should have walked away.""  That's one of the best opening lines ever for a novel.  I have to admit I was fairly obsessed with cataloging the differences between book and film, mostly those due to what I'll call ""Polanski-induced restrictions.""  The book takes place mostly in three locales: London; Martha's Vineyard and New York City.  Polanski can travel to none of those places.  So, Berlin serves as London.  A bleak island in the North Sea serves as gray, wintertime Martha's Vineyard.  And Harris and Polanski - as adapters of the novel into a screenplay - conspire to write NYC out of the plot all together.",1278374400,4,2269,5.024128686327078
4132048,4,B003JZCVR8,"This is Roman Polanski's latest movie. That is an issue in itself, which I have decided to ignore. I believe I can have an opinion about his work independent of moral judgments of the man's life.
Polanski has made many very different movies. Some of them were very good. I can not remember any that would be classified as political thriller. Why did he decide to make this one? My hunch is that he was interested in other aspects of the story, not the main plot.

The film is based on a thriller by Robert Harris. Harris normally writes a different kind of book. He is best known for `historical' thrillers, like Enigma, or Imperium, and for `alternative history' thrillers, like Fatherland, or Archangel. I like his books a lot. The Ghost was unusual in picking up a recent subject, which of course also fades more and more into history, however not entirely as long as the Iraq adventure is not finished.

As a political thriller, it deals with the Iraq war and with Britain's participation in it. Brosnan plays a barely disguised version of Blair. He is the ex PM by now, and resides on an island like Martha's Vineyard as a guest of a US conglomerate that earns its bucks in `security', specializing on Middle Eastern issues. He gets accused of war crimes and the International Court starts prosecution. His American friends stand by him. He is facing a situation where he may not leave the US without danger of arrest.

As a thriller, it deals with the situation of the ghostwriter. The ex-PM is writing his memoirs. His ghostwriter and long time collaborator drowns few weeks before publishing deadlines. The hastily hired replacement, McEwan, finds himself in an oddly claustrophobic situation on this island with mostly bad weather, in an isolated super-safe high- tech house, with neurotic people who are always highly strung. Main source of tension is Mrs. ex-PM, who is fighting  psycho wars with everybody, most intensively with Brosnan's personal assistant (an attractive blonde who warns off any expected ouvertures by McEwan by telling him that she misses her husband, within less than an hour of their `cooperation'.). It is an atmosphere of  suspicion, jealousy and hysteria.

Suspicions about the predecessor's death begin to grow in the ghost's mind. Was he murdered? Strange clues are found in his material. Quickly McEwan finds and investigates traces of a conspiracy. His relation with the boss is not good. (On first encounter, Brosnan asks: who are you? McEwan says: I am your ghost. That is not received too favorably, though Mrs. Ex says: see, he is funny.) His relationship with the boss's wife is difficult (he asks her: did you ever want to be a proper politician yourself? she answers this insult by asking: and you, did you ever want to be a proper writer?) ...

Here I have to stop relating the plot, to avoid spoilers.
What do I think of the film? The plot is too contemporary to be a comfortable subject for a thriller. Its characters are too identifiable. It is too easy to confuse fiction with allegations. If it were mainly meant to carry a political message, it is too indecisive and loses its steam through its fictional elements. As we say in German: not fish, not meat.
The political message that stands, independent of twists and turns of the plot, is the accusation that every single decision that the ex-PM has taken as PM was in the interest of a foreign government.
Esthetically, the island life and the siege situations, when protesters and press bother the inmates of the `asylum', have a strong identity and mood. Was Polanski telling us of his own situation in Switzerland?",1276992000,3,3623,4.80577849117175

4132050,5,B003JZCVR8,"THE GHOST (WRITER) is a truly enjoyable thriller which has this reality feel to it, no superheroes, no spectacular action scenes, no gratuitous gore or murder, but an entertaining tale of political intrigue and corruption, somewhat Hitchcockian, not too complex, which allows you to enjoy every aspect of it. The characters are believable and vulnerable individuals all with their virtues and flaws, which makes you care.  They really are the victims of the situations they've gotten themselves into.  One thing, however, that made me love this film was its atmosphere.  Simply amazing.  Here we see the real genius Polanski at work (as with THE PIANIST).  How he's able to create a universe of anxiety, suspicion, and mystery by using all visual and audio means at his disposal.  There is Lang's house, of course, a magnificent setting, luxurious, but cold and sterile, blockhouse-like, concealing terrible secrets.  There is the island, the weather, desolate, gray, where the constant wind and rain enhance the feeling of despair and imminent doom.  Oh, yes, and the music.  Just listen to track 16 `The Truth about Ruth' on the soundtrack and you get into the mood.  The perfect musical accompaniment by Alexandre Desplat.  The end of the film is a masterstroke, surprising and unexpected, yet leaving all possibilities open.  THE GHOST WRITER is a story about real people committing REAL crimes.  Roman Polanski, a well-deserved Silver Bear!  Film lovers, don't miss it.",1276300800,3,1474,5.190677966101695
4132051,3,B003JZCVR8,"If this movie were a nice, single-malt whisky I'd review it as follows:
Nose: dried orange peel, dark chocolate, wild cherry with a hint of peat.
Taste: full-bodied and almost chewy, clings to the palate.
Finish: Wait? What? No finish???

It all starts out very promising. From the very first minutes the movie draws you near. You find yourself IN the story, wondering what will happen next. Even though the pace is quite slow, it's never boring.

Then suspense is built up, and up, and up... And then when you expect a grand finale... Suddenly the credits start rolling and you're left with a hollow feeling, thinking: ""Wait... That's it???""

It's an absolute bore with ""surprise"" plot that's not much of a surprise, ""suspense"" efforts that's totally suspense free and characters that are caricutures.  By the way, if you like Pierce Brosnon and expect great things from him in this movie, you'll be sorely disappointed.  Ewan, much like in Cassandra's Dream (another dud by another famous director), basically repeats that role.  This movie MAY have been an ok made-for-TV movie but to actually have to pay and sit through this mess, jeezz...  It's unfortunate that Polanski have to live up to the high standard set with the ""Pianist"" so maybe I'm being overly harsh.

4132053,4,B003JZCVR8,"The mounting suspense and twisty plot turns may recall Hitchcock, but the richly paranoid mood, the ambiguous moral compass and especially the climax of this politically driven 2010 thriller are pure Polanski.

Still, it remains crackling good entertainment on its own terms. Based on Robert Harris' 2007 novel,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Ghost/dp/B000XTGFTS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Ghost</a>, the story (adapted by Harris and Polanski) wraps around Adam Lang, a renowned world leader who is fighting extradition for past war crimes. Similarities to former UK Prime Minister Tony Blair are purely intentional since Pierce Brosnan's sharply rendered portrayal evokes such comparisons. The handsome, charismatic Lang was forced to resign when he supported a war as a favor to the U.S. President even if it irreparably damaged his reputation at home. Along with his tightly wound wife Ruth and suspiciously efficient assistant Amelia Bly, Lang is staying in a private compound on Martha's Vineyard in order to finish his memoirs.

Enter a professional ghostwriter hired to finish Lang's memoirs, an assignment nearly completed when the first ghostwriter is suddenly found washed ashore on the island. The circumstances for his death are unclear, and the new writer is given just one month to spruce up what his predecessor had written. Just as the writer settles into his new role, Lang is ordered by the International Criminal Court to stand trial for handing over four suspected terrorists to the CIA for torture such as water-boarding. The gears are set in motion with the book's deadline pushed up due to the breaking news and the writer discovering information secretly left behind by his dead predecessor. The plot thickens considerably with Ruth playing a pivotal role as she unravels from the crisis and the surprise appearance of a Harvard professor named Paul Emmet whose past association with Lang may implicate the political leader in a burgeoning conspiracy that proves life-threatening to the writer. By the time the puzzle pieces come together, Polanski provides a crescendo that melds the brooding intensity of a mystery with a canny sense of political intrigue.

In the title role, Ewan McGregor brings fervent energy to a nameless everyman character whose entire existence appears to rest on the secrets within the manuscript. With subtle force, Brosnan exposes the vainglorious underbelly of the Blair doppelganger, while Olivia Williams sears the screen with fierce intensity as Ruth, a cross between Hillary Clinton, Lady MacBeth and Mrs. Robinson of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Graduate/dp/B00000F798/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Graduate</a>.

4132054,5,B003JZCVR8,"Sure not to be included at any American Enterprise Institute (read: neoconservative) awards banquet or used as a CIA recruitment film, Roman Polanski is at his realpolitick best with ""The Ghost Writer.""
 Ewan McGregor plays ""The Ghost"" very well. We hear his actual name early in the film but Polanski cleverly makes us forget it after McGregor's character claims to have no family and is repeatedly called ""man"" by his client - former British Prime Minister Adam Lange (played by Pierce Bosnan). Brosnan plays the dodgy pol to a tee, showing us that political thrillers may be his cuppa tea. It's Brosnan's best movie work since ""The Thomas Crown Affair."" (Sorry, Pierce, but Daniel Craig and Timothy Dalton are better at playing James Bond).
 Polanski neatly hides the underlying problem in plain sight - The British PM's name resembles that of the headquarters of a foreign intelligence service. This is Polanski taking a John le Carre-esqe poke at Tony Blair and his Cool Britainnia and its kneeling posture vis a vi W. Bush's U.S. during the Iraq War. Think: Blair House in Washington isn't named after Tony Blair but it ought to be.
 As always, Polanski's room of ideas and history is handsomely furnished. He pays tribute to past espionage thrillers in casting Timothy Hutton (""The Falcon and The Snowman"") as Lange's lawyer. We recall Polanski's masterpiece - ""Chinatown"" - when the great Eli Wallach (""The Two Jakes"") steps out from behind the door of an old sea shack. The curve-ball ending of ""The Ghost Writer"" isn't on par with ""Chinatown"" but it's compelling nonetheless.
 The writer/director even manages a rehabilitation of the non-partisan press. The Ghost represents the faceless print media that Rush Limbaugh and friends love to complain about but couldn't live without. On behalf of those not likely to become a Woodward and/or Bernstein we thank you, Roman.
 The Richard Rycart character bears a strong resemblance to Robin Cook, a minister sacked by Blair for not being sufficiently pro-American. If this film gets London to reassess ""the special relationship"" then John Bull-y for the UK.
 Polanski also has a veiled message for Jews and Israelis in that the person pulling Lange's strings has the same name as a revered historical figure that converted to Judaism and became, as it were, more Jewish than the ""regular"" Jews themselves. A beautiful story that but also a teaching about zeal applicable to today's Middle East. Interestingly, Polanski gives this person's recruiter the same name as the most famous Jewish convert to Christianity, a point that Christians and especially Christian Zionists should reflect on.
 The lesson is for Jews and Israelis to put their faith in what Russell Kirk called the permanent things (G-d and Torah) and that perpetual conversion to Americanism is a recipe for trouble with Arabs and Muslims. The Holy Land will find peace by being a multiethnic spiritual crossroads (""My House shall be a house for all peoples,"" G-d told Isaiah) and not as The Jewish State or as Little Apartheid America.
 But just as you're ready to join Israel's Peace Now movement, Polanski reverses field with some Kissinger-type wisdom - Lange's rant to The Ghost about airport security while they're flying on Lange's private jet (the former PM's near last words) should be taken seriously.
 Polanski's message sounds notes from Ernst Mach's intellectual symphony - the world is always as we find it at that given instant and we can't wish that away. Like it or not, the past is a powerful ghost.",1269993600,3,3537,5.0119250425894375
4132055,5,B003JZCVR8,"The Ghost Writer (2010) is the type of movie I love and the film making at its best. Mystery/thriller, in this case a political thriller/suspense, is among my favorite genres and Roman Polanki's film never disappoints. I also think of it as of the masterful Ghost film. The ghosts are everywhere in the film, the ghosts of the past and regrets, including the references to the director's own personal ghosts.

All directors who think they know how to set and make a thriller / suspense need to watch the movie made by 76 years old Roman Polanski and learn how to make a highly thrilling exciting movie without special impressive effects or overindulgence with blood, gore, shooting, and sex. The Ghost Writer is magnificent - intelligent, exciting, and dark. Each character is not a two-dimensional cardboard figure, but an interesting personality, each with a ghost in their past. Pierce Brosnan with each new movie shows that he is more than Bond. James Bond. Ewan McGregor did remarkably well in the lead role of the man without a name, a successful ""ghost writer"" who has received an enviable contract to make a bestseller of the autobiography of a former British Prime Minister Adam Lang (Brosnan). Lang had to resign and now is facing the international tribunal on the charges related to the crimes against the British citizens during the war in Iraq. McGregor's hero with no name snatched the dream contract after the previous ""ghost writer"" who had been with Lang for years, tragically and unexpectedly died.

I also want to mention Tom Wilkinson in a small role of the distinguished Harvard professor who has known the former PM since their students' days in Oxford. Olivia Williams makes Ruth Land, Adam's wife, such riveting screen presence and her character one of the most interesting among all.

The film was made with such assurance, confidence and skill that it never lets the excitement and tension go for a moment. The majority of film takes place on the Martha's Vineyard Island in New England, Massachusetts, during the winter when it rains incessantly, creating oppressive and unforgiving atmosphere of imminent danger. Alfred Hitchcock whom Polanski seemed to pay homage with this film would have been pleased with it. Some scenes are worthy of the cinema textbooks. I only say that I don't recall the expression ""The Ghost in the machine"" been so remarkably well and cleverly used as in The Ghost Writer.

I highly recommend to watch and re-watch The Ghost Writer because after it is over and you already know who is who and why, the film can be enjoyed as a beautiful piece of filmmaking and you can pay closer attention to the wonderful music, to creative camera work, art direction, production values and everything else that makes a film not just a flick but an event.",1269993600,6,2795,4.877894736842105
4132056,4,B003JZCVR8,"In this stylish, political mystery-thriller a mostly drunken (unnamed?) ghost writer (Ewan Mcgregor) is pulled in by a publisher to write the autobiography of the ex-British Prime Minister Adam Lang, a fictionalized Tony Blair (played by Pierce Brosnan). The PM of the story is now retired on an island off Massachusetts, like Martha's Vineyard, although I don't remember it actually being named. The island is only reached by ferry. The ghost writing job was started by another writer who has died, mysteriously falling off the ferry to the island. Did he commit suicide?  The house where the PM, his estranged wife Ruth, and staff headed by tart mouthed assistant Amelia played by Kim Cattrall (Sex in the City), seems less a home and more a fortress, or a bunker with armed guards. I guess that is what is needed today. The concrete and steel house and the lonely, desolate island with sand and oatgrass, wind, the gray churning stormy skies are symbolic and materially contribute to a sense of gloom, oppression and menace throughout the movie. This mood is enhanced by the cameraman's consistent use of blue and green filters. The house, the environment, is a star of the movie, in a sense.

The ""ghost"" is given a ludicrously short timeframe, first a month then two weeks to clean up the dead writers work and finish the bio. The PM seems rather reluctant to talk much which makes the writer's job all the more difficult. All involved seem to not want to fill in the bio gaps, they just want the ghost to hurry up and fix the phone book sized bio written by his predecessor. The ghost starts asking questions...

Suddenly things turn ugly as protestors start to question the PM's involvement or complicity into Bush Administration policies Guantanamo, rendition, waterboarding, etc. The PM and other people in the bumker house seem to have a bumker mentality. The ghost takes a ride around the island to ask questions of locals and takes the ferry to the mainland to research some ambiguous statements and some pictures he finds. Are there people following him or is he being paranoid?

Ex-patriot director Roman Polanski has made a deeply atmospheric movie in the old sense, Hitchcockian (as is mentioned elsewhere), a thoughtful, tense, topical mystery movie for adults, which is so much a rarity today. I will avoid comment on his legal problems and just say that he is a great director and I hope these problems end and he returns to this country and continues to make movies of this quality (like ""Chinatown"") rather than the mindless dreck Hollywood mostly cranks out today. It it a sad commentary that this movie isn't, as of today, in the top ten box office releases.

This is one of the most intriguing and consistently interesting movies of the new year.",1269820800,5,2770,4.823157894736842
4132057,5,B003JZCVR8,"The answer: yes, he does.

I thought I would get this question out of the way, as that is what my friends wanted to know upon learning I had seen ""The Ghost Writer."" By now I suspect McGregor has a clause in every contract that stipulates million dollar fines from the producers unless the actor is allowed to flash us on film. Cheeky sod!

Back on topic:

Former British Prime Minister Adam Lang is staying on Nantucket, writing his memoirs. When a body is fished out of the sea near Lang's house, it turns out to be that of his ghost writer. The death is quickly pronounced a suicide and a new ghost writer is dispatched. Enter Ewan McGregor (still fully clothed at this point). The man quickly realizes not all is well in the house of Lang. Dead body, witness in a coma, group of seemingly innocent photographs carefully hidden under the dead man's sock drawer... Lots of questions, few answers. Alas, once The Ghost Writer makes the decision to step foot on the path of discovery, he cannot turn back. The unfolding events promise a sinister conclusion, and do not disappoint...

The tense story is courtesy of a book by the British journalist Robert Harris. The book caused a bit of a stir upon its publication back in the UK as the character of Adam Lang is clearly made in the image of the actual former British Prime Minister Tony Blair. The insinuations the author makes about the ex-Prime Minister and his possible involvement with the CIA are so preposterous they cannot be believed. According to Harris, the low probability of the events was the very reason he avoided being sued by Blair. And yet, the suggestions are so deliciously scandalous, some part of us cannot help but wish they were true... Harris and Polanski, the film's director, expertly transformed the book into a script. The slow boil of tension the film delivers reminds me somewhat of ""Touch of Evil"" by Orson Welles. No CGI, no gimmicks; just good old fashioned filmmaking supporting a clever plot... It has been a while since going to the movies felt so good. Do not deprive yourself of the experience.",1269561600,3,2085,4.657608695652174
4132058,5,B003JZCVR8,"I was reluctant to see this film, fearing it might be dark and depressing.  I was very pleasantly surprised to find an interesting, well-made film that held my interest from the mysterious beginning to the almost amusing ending.  I won't relate the story since the Amazon reviewer and others have done that.
After seeing it I pondered just why it was so good.  Since I'm not a film student I couldn't analyze its components and come up with a good reason.  I concluded that it was just well-done, all around.

The casting is perfect.  Ewan McGregor is just right as the smart, but not-too smart guy who finds himself in a pretty mess when he accepted a ghost-writing job for a former British MP.  He is attractive, but doesn't overwhelm you with his charm.  This is no James Bond, and we like him a lot for his sort of vulnerable heroic qualities.

Pierce Brosnan is appropriately creepy as the PM, who used to be an actor back at Yale and Cambridge, and uses his talents in the political arena. Olivia Williams ('hope I got her name right) is super as his Harvard/Cambridge educated wife, and the brains in the family.  She is so funny and smart and pathetic and strong, in turn, that you want to root for her to get an Oscar nomination for best supporting actress next year.  (I hope they remember her.)

I thought Kim Cattrell was very good, too, as the PM's hyper-efficient assistant, and mistress.  Her accent may have wavered a bit but she had the attitude nailed down.  She's actually very funny.  There are brief appearances by a number of well known actors, not the least of whom is Eli Wallach.  They all add to the fun of the film, although this is not intended to be a funny film.

The dialogue is very smart, but again it doesn't overwhelm you with its cleverness.  Polanksi shows brilliance, subtlety and restraint in every aspect of the film, including the murky, menacing, seaside where most of the action takes place.  This is a smart guy and he knows how to make good films.

This is one of the few films I think I will see a second time.  I  recommend it.",1269302400,6,2074,4.474666666666667
4132059,5,B003JZCVR8,"""The Ghost Writer"" is excellent! This is how the story goes: When a successful British ghostwriter, The Ghost, agrees to complete the memoirs of former British Prime Minister Adam Lang, his agent assures him it's the opportunity of a lifetime. But the project seems doomed from the start--not least because his predecessor on the project, Lang's long-term aide, died in an unfortunate accident. The Ghost flies out to work on the project, in the middle of winter, to an oceanfront house on an island off the U.S. Eastern seaboard. But the day after he arrives, a former British cabinet minister accuses Lang of authorizing the illegal seizure of suspected terrorists and handing them over for torture by the CIA -- a war crime. The controversy brings reporters and protesters swarming to the island mansion where Lang is staying with his wife, Ruth, and his personal assistant and mistress, Amelia. As The Ghost works, he begins to uncover clues suggesting his predecessor may have stumbled on a dark secret linking Lang to the CIA -- and that somehow this information is hidden in the manuscript he left behind. Was Lang in the service of the American intelligence agency while he was prime minister? And was The Ghost's predecessor murdered because of the appalling truth he uncovered?

The cast led by Ewan McGregor (as The Ghost) & Pierce Brosnan (as Adam Lang) is excellent! The directing by Roman Polanski (who also wrote the screenplay and produced) (who also directed ""Rosemary's Baby"" (1968), ""Chinatown"" (1974) & ""The Pianist"" (2002, which won him the Best Director Oscar, he also produced) is excellent!

The cinematography by Pawel Edelman (who also did the cinematography to ""The Pianist"" & ""Ray"" (2004) is excellent! The film editing by Herv de Luze (who also did the film editing to ""The Pianist"") is excellent! The casting by Fiona Weir (who also did the casting to ""Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire"" (2005), ""Harry Potter And The Order Of The Phoenix"" (2007), ""Harry Potter And The Half-Blood Prince"" (2009), the upcoming ""Harry Potter And The Deathly Hallows Parts I & II"" (2010 & 2011) & ""Invictus"" (2009) is excellent! The production design by Albrecht Konrad is excellent! The art direction by Cornelia Ott (who also did the art direction to ""Valkyrie"" (2008), David Scheunemann (supervising art director) (who also did the art direction to ""Inglourious Basterds"" (2009) & the upcoming ""The Apparition"" (2010) & Steve Summersgill (who also did the art direction to the upcoming ""The Apparition"") is excellent! The set decoration by Katharina Birkenfeld & Bernhard Henrich (who also did the set decoration to ""Valkyrie"" & ""The Bourne Supremacy"" (2004) is excellent!
