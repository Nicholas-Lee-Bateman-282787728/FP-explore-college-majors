6382626,2,B00JPFTSD6,"Legendary: Tomb of the Dragon features a battle between man and beast. Dr. Travis Preston (Scott Adkins) is a crypto- zoologist  a scientist who tracks down animals thought to be extinct. He and his team travel to a remote region of China where the locals believe a primeval monster roams free and a merciless trophy hunter (Dolph Lundgren) has already set up camp. A race against time follows for Travis and his team to capture the creature alive.

The conflict here is the same as that in The Thing From Another World and Creature From the Black Lagoon. Characters disagree about how to treat a real threat to human life: scientists want to preserve and study it, while the non-scientists want to destroy it. The acting is sub-par and so is the script.

Special features on the DVD release include interviews with Scott Adkins and Dolph Lundgren and a making-of featurette.",1407715200,,875,4.781456953642384

6382631,3,B00JPFTSD6,"Let me start with this. I know giving three stars is pretty generous. The film is not that good, but I like this kind of silly adventure movies. And I like Dolph Lundgren, too.

Another thing you must keep in mind is that, despite the two players Scott Adkins and Dolph Lundgren, this is NOT a martial arts action movie. So please don't expect something like The Expendables 2.

A UK-Chinese production Legendary: Tomb of the Dragon revolves around the adventure of Travis Preston (Scott Adkins), a London-based cryptozoologist or a person studying animals of which existence has not been proven. Travis and his team fly to a remote village in Central China, looking for a mysterious creature terrorizing the locals and construction site workers. Travis has to accomplish the mission of capturing the animal before a ruthless hunter named Harker (Dolph Lundgren) kills it.

In short, Legendary is a low-budget adventure movie shot on-location in China. Except for some beautiful scenery there is nothing new in this creature-themed action. One good thing is that the film does not take itself too seriously. It is fast-paced and light-hearted, and totally forgettable with not-so-great effects and generic set-pieces.",1399766400,2,1217,5.16751269035533
6382632,2,B00JPFTSD6,"It's a bad movie with no bad-movie-quirkiness or corniness to make it amusing.

Dolph Lundgren is evil, with some random lame attempts at forming an evil philosophy of life (including the incorrect claim that only humans lie). Scott Adkins is the typical monster movie idiot who doesn't want to kill the beast (with the ridiculous assertion that they have no reason to kill it, after it has killed several people).

The monster is nothing but a medium-quality giant CGI lizard. Very boring monster.

Of course the good guys end up killing the monster to protect themselves, even though they didn't mind dragging their feet as it killed several locals.  Kind of morally hazy.  In the end, the argument between the good guys and bad guy is whether or not killing the monster was awesome, though there was obviously no disagreement at that point that it had to be done.  This is like an Internet flame war over a functionless distinction.  Lame.",1417305600,4,942,4.813664596273292

6382634,3,B00JPFTSD6,"I must see all movies on monsters. All of 'em. Even when they're kind of bad. Like this kind of bad.

Still..., while it's not as crazy as SHARKNADO it's memorable in its own little way. At least, it worked for me as a diversionary strategy during a long weekend down with foodpoisoning. Then there's Dolph Lundgren. Given too many lines that distract from his legendary physical presence, which, regardless of your sexual prefs, is darned amazing just to gawk at, right?  Lundgren can go from weirdly ironic to campy very quickly.

This monster film seems to be set in China. Two things were interesting: the absolute, unquestioning submission to authority that seemed to be culturally acceptable, the norm, in ""what seems to be China""; after all, it's a movie, a low-budget American portrayal of a totally different political reality.  Didn't research the film after seeing it, so I wasn't sure, and mean no offense to whatever Asian country this was filmed in and/or intended to portray. That said, there were a couple of hilarious physical gags in small to medium boats that were standouts. One or two of the monster scenes looked really low budget, but some were OK. To rent, LEGENDARY makes a doable hangover distraction. Add a couple margaritas, even better.",1412208000,4,1265,4.897196261682243

6382636,4,B00JPFTSD6,"Okay admittedly I am a sucker for Dolph Lundgren and special effects laden movies. While it's never going to win any awards and the CGI effects were only okay. It wasn't a bad movie to watch compared, Dolph plays Dolph, albeit something of a heavy this time around. The acting and story wasn't the worst in a b movie looking to make it frequently into the Sy-Fy channel Saturday rotation. If your looking something to kill time with a bag of popcorn this isn't a bad way to go.",1410307200,,477,4.370786516853933
6382637,3,B00JPFTSD6,"This is a movie to watch when incredibly bored. It has two dimensional characters, that are more laughable than anything, and about as many movie cliches as a teen slasher flick. As bad movies go, it doesn't make up for lack of plot, or whatever, with adult content. The one thing that really got me was the directing. I have no doubt Lundgren could portray a homicidal narcissist without coming off as a wannabee with some serious overcompensation issues. I can't figure out if its suppose to be a comedy or not, but its definitely not realistic.",1409702400,,547,4.649484536082475

8652738,1,B00JPFTSD6,"Pathetic giant creature, no action, no laughs, no fun kills by creature, no interesting characters, just a lot of boring dialogue.  Definitely nothing to make it Legendary.  Even Barney Stinson who can label laser tag and other lame things ""Legen....waitforit.....dary, wouldn't claim this slow, boring, movie with a small lizard from a backyard, blown up on a green screen in the background to around the size of a car, that Scott Adkins wants to capture and Dolph Lungdren wants to shoot and mount its corpse on his wall, as Legendary.  The CGI is bad, therefore the creature which is what these sorts of movies are all about, looks really bad.  It's not even that big.  The giant bear in the opening scenes was a better thought to be extinct creature.  Both these creatures have tooth decay and leave their incisors in prey they've killed so Adkins can pick the tooth up and be amazed at how big the animal must be.

What really lets the film down is, simply it's boring.  There's a lot of standing around talking, none of it is interesting. I ended up fast forwarding the talking scenes from about the half way mark.  Even though the two actors being used to market the film are action stars, the movie has no action in it at all.",1512432000,,1234,4.572727272727272

8652740,2,B00JPFTSD6,"This is not the type of film one would expect upon finding out that it stars the likes of Scott Adkins (""Expendables 2"") & Dolph Lundgren (""Expendables 2""), and fans of either are strongly advised to look elsewhere.  In fact, the casting and production makes me wonder just who the intended audience really was.  The overall mood of this film is somewhere between a '90s wholesome Disney adventure, a cheap SyFy channel cheese-fest, and a tv pilot.  Since there's no angst-ridden, recently-adopted adolescent or lost cuddly dog for our heroes to either mentor or rescue, scientist Travis Preston (Adkins) and company will have to settle for looking for a crudely animated 15-foot Chinese gecko with serious territoriality issues.  Standing in their way is Harker (Lundgren), a narcissistic hunter who wants the glory of blowing away something more exotic than the usual rhinos and lions he's used to gunning down.  Preston & friends want to stop the yet-to-be-discovered creature from killing anymore people but to capture it alive and insure its survival and contribution to science.

My typical review would be for a martial arts film.  The kind that Adkins (and occasionally Lundgren) would normally star in. Usually, after describing the plot, I would delve into the quality of the fight scenes.  Since there's none here to talk about, I'd like to mention how much easier things would've been for everyone involved (especially the viewer) had Preston simply decided to kickbox the hell out of Harker.  But sadly, no.  Oh, he decks him once but it's not the same.  So the real problem with the fight scenes is that they don't exist.  The problem with other action in the film is that it does exist.  I know this is not a big budget Hollywood film, but special effects are less convincing now than they were 20 years ago.  The animated amphibious predator seen in this flick makes ""Sharknado"" look like ""Jurassic Park"".

In other areas, the supporting cast is mostly likeable, with Yi Huang (""The Legend is Born: Ip Man"") providing the bulk of the obligatory romantic interest.  Not the cute, perky Lydia Leonard (""The Fifth Estate"") that the film initially hinted at.  Everyone does a decent enough job, though it's hard to sound wooden repeatedly yelling things like, ""Hold on!"", ""Watch out!"", ""Come on!"", or even ""Get out of the water!"".  Lundgren's character takes a less-sadistic cue from his ""Universal Soldier"" days and frequently gets philosophical about why he's such a jerk.  He's kind of an interesting character who at least seems to buy his into his own nonsense.

The Lionsgate/Wreckin Hill DVD has a nice 16x9 widescreen picture (2.39:1) that only looks like crap when the lizard is on the screen.  Special features include separate interviews with the 2 stars and a ""making of"" featurette.  I can't help but think the two leads were under the impression that this film would be for real.  The interviews were clearly conducted when production wrapped, before the boys had the opportunity to see how doofy the finished product was.  The overall production and use of Chinese locations looks both slick and cheap at the same time.  Run time of 92 minutes.  For the record, I had low expectations and did enjoy watching it, but there's not really a reason to recommend it either.

8652746,3,B00JPFTSD6,"I stand by the moto which says, ""A movie monster is far more effective when glimpsed briefly and in quick shots."" This worked tremendously well in Steven Spielberg's groundbreaking blockbuster, ""Jaws"", where we waited until the hour mark to fully see the shark as well as in films like the original ""Alien"" and the slew of imitators of these that came afterwards. ""Legendary"", directed by Eric Styles and starring Dolph Lundren, is proof that this slow reveal formula still works.

  It doesn't quite live up to its name or these two prior mentioned films but it still is an endearingly fun B movie with a monster that, when finally shown in the finale proves fair in the effects department (far better than the average C.G.I. fests of late) but its as likable for the way it goes through the familiar monster movie conventions with amusement and in an entertaining way without appearing to simply be checking off a list of creature conventions.

  There is a bit of a romantic sub-plot that seems forced and exists for no more than weak character development,  Dolph Lundren is his usual stone-faced self (though very fitting for his role), there's nothing spectacular about the adequate performances but I enjoyed it for its echoes of ""Godzilla"" and the many beast on the loose films before it.

  ""Legendary"" knows what it is, what its audience wants and gives it to them without being pretentious. Sometimes that's all you need for a more than satisfying time at the cinema.",1417737600,,1478,4.829365079365079
8652747,2,B00JPFTSD6,"I usually like movies like this to some degree, and I'm sort of a fan of Dolph Lundgren, but this movie was very boring overall. Movies like Sharknado and its sequel, and Big A$$ Spider have upted the ante for killer animal movies, and Legendary just doesn't cut it. A movie like this today needs humor to be fun, and this one was so dry and humorless and the PG-13 rating doesn't help as there's no gore either. Skip it.",1417651200,,421,4.275
