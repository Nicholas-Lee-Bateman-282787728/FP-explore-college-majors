4310261,4,B004AODY3C,"The story is not original, but it is still a fun movie to watch. I found the comedy to be more on the stupid side. It will make you laugh. You could tell the characters had some chemistry as they were very good together...really made the film what it is. I would not say this is a four star movie, but definately a 3 star, unfortunately Amazon decided to have a 5 star system to complicate the matter.",1297468800,,401,4.153846153846154
4310262,4,B004AODY3C,"AWESOME film. Loved every minute of it. But fair warning: If you don't find British humor funny - then this isn't for you.

This is UK dark comedy at its absolute warm-from-the-tap finest.

Would have never guessed Bill Nighy could be the lead actor - never. Especially after seeing him in the Underworld series. But wow - given the opportunity, the man has the cool styling and elegance of Cary Grant. Admittedly he's not the looker type, but he makes up for it in pure panache. Will never see him as a pure second player again. That Director Jonathan Lynn saw this is, in my opinion, a true stroke of brilliance.

Not being a Harry Potter fan, I have never seen any of the films. So this was my first exposure to Rupert Grint. This guy is hilarious! Played his role as the fumbling slacker turned apprentice assassin perfectly. Kid has some serious acting chops - I hope his career path follows a similar UK actor that I enjoy watching - Simon Pegg.

And another first for me - my first Emily Blunt film. Not only is she stunning - she's incredibly funny! A lethal combination - no pun intended. The world is her oyster and she certainly deserves it. Looking forward to more from this young actress.

Can't say enough good things about this film. The one single drawback - pet lovers be warned. (hands raised in defense)",1297382400,4,1322,4.514644351464435
4310263,4,B004AODY3C,"Given the way that some movie critics dumped on this film, I fully expected I wouldn't like it.  I'm pleased to say that I thought it was a pretty good little bit of black comedy.  The premise is not exactly original:  Victor (played by Bill Nighy), a sophisticated but lonely hitman, falls in love with a woman he's been ordered to kill.  He decides to protect her instead.  Chaos and mayhem ensue.  ""Wild Target"" is given a boost out of the completely banal by Emily Blunt's performance as Rose, who comes across as someone even an uptight triggerman might fall for.

What kept me from giving the movie five stars is that most of the laughs are front-loaded...the pace of the film slowed down some once they got to the country home of Victor and the birthday party scene was a bit contrived.  Another thing that worked slightly against the film was that Victor came across as so uptight and reserved, it was perhaps a bit difficult to see him and Rose as a couple.

But this being said, I thought it was a fun movie and I don't feel I wasted my money buying it or my time watching it.",1297296000,3,1086,4.36318407960199
4310264,5,B004AODY3C,"This is a wonderfully hilarious subtle British comedy with Bill Nighy, Emily Blunt, and Rupert Grint. Three completely different characters (an aging assassin, a lady thief, and a young stoner) meet under the most unusual circumstances and learn to interact and find a common ground, while constantly facing threats from people trying to kill them.

The Blu-ray transfer is nice and clean, which was a pleasant surprise considering its price is less than that of an average DVD!

Definitely one I will be watching many times (I have just finished watching it for the first time).",1297296000,,579,5.020833333333333
4310265,4,B004AODY3C,"Bill Nighy has a following in my store no matter what the film's theme is, and in this case he plays his age and character beautifully.

The story follows an aging hit man revered as the best at what he does, but an assignment to snuff a young klepto/con-artist played adequately by Ms. Blunt goes awry and the fun begins. It is like a bumbling Stooges act for the middle of the film as he decides to protect her instead, while also apprenticing a hapless young man. Nighy's mom is a little over-the-top by Eileen Atkins who I last saw in the nice film&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Evening/dp/B000V6LSOA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Evening</a>, and the remaining cast is average to overly cheesy. The comedy tried to be dark as the body count goes up, but Nighy carries this overall without letting it get too slapstick.

The Blu specs are solid as the picture is clear, so much so that the background failings can be obvious (can see the rain outside nearby windows when they are trying to make it look sunny, crew reflections, etc.) and the DTS is mixed nicely. The car chase scenes are where the channels get used the most and it surrounds you just right. Unfortunately though Fox once again dumps this BD with nothing extra. The ""On Target with Emily Blunt"" lasts a few minutes and is immediately forgettable. You really want to have there be a making of documentary or commentary as quite a few questions come up about the production (why he holds the gun in such an obscure way throughout the film, locations, etc). 3.5 for the film and .5 for the Blu specs. Region coded A with English language only and subs in same. A light comedy that does not take itself too seriously, enjoy.",1296864000,24,1732,4.828282828282828

4310298,5,B004AODY3C,"If you're a fan of dark humour than Wild Target won't disappoint.  If you're not, than you're probably best buying something else.  Basically Emily Blunt's character is a thief/con artist, and rips off a rich guy with a fake delivered stolen Rembrandt.  He put out a hit on her, using the number one hitman (Bill Nighy's character), but circumstance after circumstance on the day means he keeps having to back out of the hit.  After being told off by his elderly mother for bringing down their family name's reputation he sets out the next day to finish the job, only to encounter in her carpark someone else in the act of doing  his job for him.  He of course can't have that, but it turns out the other hitman had a partner.  Misunderstanding that he was just a good samaratin saving her life, the two flee while being shot at together with an actual good samaratin kid (Rupert Grint) who was also in the car park. Thinking he's got the skills to protect her, she hires him to be her bodyguard.  Of course the two have some severe personality clashes being he's neat and conservative and she's neither of those things.  The kid who has been wants to be an apprentice bodyguard and learn the ropes.

The film never takes itself too seriously.  It's a tongue in cheek movie, if you don't like things happening that aren't realistic than this also probably isn't the movie for you.  But if that's not the case, you'll enjoy this British dark comedy.",1483142400,,1448,4.5482625482625485

4310302,1,B004AODY3C,"I have to align with the one star reviewers, but not because the acting is lousy or the story terrible but because the character the Emily Blunt portrays is simply loathsome.

Wild Target is one of my favorite movies.  Light hearted characters where the good guys are good and the bad guys and bad. But it has more action and humor than the average chick flick, making this enjoyable for most guys.

4310315,4,B004AODY3C,"The premise of this dark comedy about a professional killer who falls in love with a young woman on his hit list is not all that original.
Because of that, a film such as ""Wild Target"" can only succeed if the actors are brilliant in their roles since audiences already have an idea about how the movie will turn out.
That said, this delightful British remake of a French film is a well-done, fun-to-watch movie that showcases the considerable talents of stars Bill Nighy, Emily Blunt, and Rupert Grint. It is a fast-paced film and the characters are, in a quirky sort of way, very appealing. Blunt stars as a small-time thief who uncharacteristically decides to go for one big score. She, with the help of a friend, swindles a ruthless businessman by selling him a fake Rembrandt. Discovering the fact he has been cheated, the businessman sends hitman Bill Nighy to kill her and retrieve his money.
Things don't work out, however, because Nighy's character is fascinated by his completely amoral target.
I'm not going to examine the plot in any great detail here because that would be unfair to those who have not yet seen the film. However, I will say that while there are no real plot twists, the quality of the acting and the smooth direction of this movie make it an enjoyable viewing experience.

I first saw Bill Nighy in ""Shawn of the Dead"" and i wanted to see more of him he is so funny here with his dry, subtle wit and charm.  The trio in this film are perfectly matched. This is such a great film, i had to watch it like 3 times. Sorry, i am too tired to go into plot and details right now.  Rent this film, you will love it .

4310409,5,B004AODY3C,"Bill Nighy has become my favorite British hitman, spy, intelligence analyst, and whatever role he's assigned. Credibility derives from talent, and Nighy provides entertainment whatever suit he wears. In Wild Target, a wonderful Birthday present from my beloved (from Amazon.com of course!), we enjoyed the loopy, seemingly plotless development of assassin who failed at his life's profession. Without Emily Blunt (and Nighy's assistance), the central character's wild flailings might have destroyed any substance in this delightful comedy. All others in this film were comparatively limited, stilted, and backdrop. The menacing assassins were pitiful foils; including their peculiar conclusions. What's not missing is the comedy; and the happenstance of the main actors clearly enjoying their craft with each other. I found the collection of the three central characters was unlikely: however, the comedy and good vibes came from their unique differences. By whatever means, from wherever you find it, Wild Target is a delightful action-comedy with warm feelings for those willing to forgo their rational needs. I highly recommend for fun-seekers!",1432339200,,1147,5.752941176470588

4310473,2,B004AODY3C,"WILD TARGET. 2010, PG.  In this all-star 98-minute British romantic/comedy/crime flick, 54-year old veteran hitman Victor Maynard, (Bill Nighy), solitary at the top of his profession, meets Rose (Emily Blunt) cute.  She is a young con artist and thief, his latest target; but owing to her beauty, he is unable to kill her. So Victor winds up hanging out with her and Tony (Rupert Grint), an unexpected sidekick they pick up; they both think Victor is a detective. Meanwhile, Victor deals with his formidable overbearing mother Louisa (Eileen Atkins); Ferguson, (Rupert Everett), the angry client who wants Rose dead and Hector Dixon (Martin Freeman), rival hitman who wants Victor out of the picture.  The film was directed by Jonathan Lynn, ( YES MINISTER, YES PRIME MINISTER, NUNS ON THE RUN, CLUE) whos had some winners and some losers.  It was based on a French  film CIBLE EMOUVANTE written by Pierre Salvadori.

Nighy, (BEST EXOTIC MARIGOLD HOTEL, LOVE ACTUALLY, PIRATE RADIO, PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN), as a former standup comic, is, of course, an excellent light comedian.  And he is another example of how well some British actors age, growing sufficiently in stature and gravitas as to be able to carry a movie.  And he is undoubtedly middle-aged, as is his character, old enough to be Roses father, which made me rather queasy.  I was reminded of this by reading on IMDb that his hands are so arthritic, he is unable to hold a gun properly, and in several scenes a hand double was used.  Some hitman.  Golden Globe -winning Emily Blunt, talented in both drama and comedy, (THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA, YOUNG VICTORIA), does well and forcefully as Rose; she is undeniably beautiful, sensual and  capricious and helps  carry the film.  Rupert Grint, (HARRY POTTER), is  excess baggage  as Tony.  Eileen Atkins, (DOC MARTIN, CRANFORD, GOSFORD PARK), is of course excellent as Louisa, Victors mom, in an inexplicably overwritten part.  Everett (MY BEST FRIENDS WEDDING, THE IMPORTANCE OF BEING EARNEST) and Freeman (SHERLOCK) do fine.

The film cost $8 million to make and, despite its starry cast, did miserably in the United States.  I can understand why.  It might have been successful in its French origins, but I don't know why it was even made in English.  Perhaps we English speaking people are colder than the French, but I, at least, need a soupcon of reality to like a picture, even a romcom.  Considering the unusually fine cast assembled here, this film is quite a disappointment.

4310474,5,B004AODY3C,"""Wild Target"" is a delightful, humorous, sweet, British movie. I knew nothing about it but bought it on the strength of the cast. Anything with Bill Nighy is usually well worth seeing. Emily Blunt is wonderful as is Eileen Atkins playing the role of mother to Bill Nighy. The premise of the film is Bill Nighy is a hit man, Emily Blunt is his target, Rupert Grint is his accidental apprentice.

Bill Nighy delivers a performance that brings you in until you care for this hit man and you find yourself hoping that he truly can find love.  Rupert Grint is hysterically funny, and brings laughs when least expected.
It's a dark comedy, people do get killed (nothing graphic) but in the end, the grand adventure, the twists and turns, leave a movie going satisfaction so rarely found these days.",1403568000,,558,4.673469387755102

SO had to see it.  5 mins into the movie  realized I had ALREADY seen it  LOL  watched it on NETFLIX a couple of years ago.  Whilst it is not the best thing EVER  it is fun.  Pleasantly quirky  the humor is not laugh out loud  more grinning a lot.  The plot leaves a lot to be desired  but it is fine  I have seen worse movies.  Even seeing for the second time  I did enjoy  and OF COURSE Bill Nighy is GREAT.  Worth a view.,1402099200,,581,3.73109243697479

A missed opportunity to write a good screenplay, because the premise has potential. The actors alternately try too hard, or don't try at all. The camera cuts to Emily Blunt's disarming smile whenever there is a gap in the dialog. The dialog itself is puerile. This movie was inexpensive. (I got it to round up an order amount to get free shipping. Worth a chance, right? No.)
I paid too much, and I don't want it taking up a slot in my DVD album. I just don't dislike anyone badly enough to give it to them. In the trash bin. Didn't watch the whole thing. Maybe Martin Freeman redeems it in scenes later than the ones I watched....",1391212800,,807,4.534246575342466

But to my pleasant surprise, I didn't give a rat's ass, because this is one of the most entertainingly quirky pieces I've seen in a long time.  Bill Nighy is wonderful as always, here playing a tight-assed,  cold-blooded assassin with a dominant mother, whose personal expectations for happiness run the gamut from a to a-.  When he falls for morally-challenged Emily Blunt, the viewer begins rooting for love, unlikely as it seems.  Rupert Grint, as non Ron Weasly as possible, adds a delightful touch of spice to the story; Rupert Everett and his gang of boobs is equally fun.

There's something oddly gothic about ""Wild Target"", where we see a mobile of rubber pistols hanging over the baby assassin's bed; Mom makes a startlingly Hitchcock-like appearance and somehow ends up a hero in the end.  Terrific writing, great acting, wonderful everything else.  You've probably never heard of this movie, but I'd suggest you buy it.  It's a good night's fun.",1360454400,,1064,4.802197802197802

4310590,4,B004AODY3C,"This is a humorous British story about an assassin and his elusive target. Bill Nighy plays the 55 year old Victor who lives at home with his mother. Being an assassin is a third generation occupation. Victor is ""old school"" in his job and his mother worries that he may become a homosexual. His hobbies include learning French, chess, and encapsulating his furniture in plastic.

Rose is a light fingered free spirit. She had a copy made of a Rembrandt, made a switch and double crossed a buyer. Victor is supposed to kill her, but after a few failed attempts because of her Inspector Clouseau ability to avoid a bullet, he has become an admirer of the girl and in a twist of fate becomes her protector with Ron Weasly as his apprentice.

While the story was humorous, it lacked a certain uniqueness. Emily Blunt was good, but I liked Rachel Weisz as a free spirit in the ""Brothers Bloom"" more.",1341273600,,895,4.552795031055901
4310591,3,B004AODY3C,"My husband and I enjoy quirky humor, so we expected to enjoy this film -- which we did, though not nearly as much as we expected.  I laughed a fair amount, but often had the uneasy feeling that I wasn't laughing at the parts where I was supposed to be laughing (which makes me wonder whether this might be a somewhat too-literal adaptation of the original French film).  Also, for whatever reason, I don't feel that the Rose character ever quite jells.

The casting and acting are very good.  The DVD has subtitles, but the only extra feature is a brief interview with Emily Blunt.

Lest anyone be deterred by the description ""black comedy,"" I'd like to point out that we do come to care about the protagonists (even though they are certainly not nice people by normal standards), and yes, there is what would have to be called a happy ending.

The main reason we bought this film was that we thought it would be fun to see frequent good guy Martin Freeman playing a hit man (in the safe environment of a comedy).  In contrast to the businesslike Victor Maynard, Hector Dixon is a sadist, and Freeman plays the part with icy relish.  I assume we would have enjoyed his performance tremendously, except that someone decided he needed scary-looking teeth.  The man is an actor(!), for pete's sake -- he doesn't need weird teeth in order to be scary.

The film's promising premise and talented cast (including Rupert Everett) ends up being squandered because of the inept direction from Jonathan Lynn, whose comedies (""Nuns on the Run,"" ""My Cousin Vinny,"" ""The Whole Nine Yards"" and others) have been hit and miss. The players are doing their best with Bill Nighy attempting to bring deadpan humor to the script but without much success, because the film is too tame, lacking the zany energy this type of comedy, or farce, really needs.

The British crime comedy is a remake of a French film ""Cible &eacute;mouvante"" starring Jean Rochefort, Marie Trintignant and Guillaume Depardieu. Like Johnny Depp / Angelina Jolie film ""The Tourist,"" ""Wild Target"" benefits from the capable cast, especially Emily Blunt and Martin Freeman as another killer chasing Rose and Victor, but their fine performances are not enough to save the film from the lazy execution.",1329177600,2,1333,5.110091743119266

Every time there seemed a return to normality, the scenario took off into surrealism, too bad, it could have been a great movie, as I said, I did not see much of the end of the movie, due to a defective DVD, but I am not sure I would have wanted to see the movie again, anytime soon.

After failed attempts to kill her, he can't seem to shake her, and soon finds himself connected to her. With the mission failed, Victor finds himself with Rose and a young slacker (Rubert Grint), as they are now the intended victims.

I don't mind understated comedy and love dry humor, but this film just didn't hit the mark (pardon the pun). Some comedies work at an understated level, but the story here just seems so stilted and dead in Wild Target.  If there is any comedy ,it barely has a pulse, as many of the jokes are mistimed. Most of the acting seems uninspired and the script really lacks anything creative.

I differed from most in that I detested the film during the first half, but it kind of grew on me a little when we find more about the characters as they are hiding out in the second half. What I didn't like was that the resolution felt a little forced, and the main character's transformations a little contrived.

There were some enjoyable moments, though. I did think it was interesting to see Rubert Grint in a different kind of role, and there are moments when Victor actually is a bit of a sympathetic character. Over all, though, Wild Target is a bit average.",1319932800,2,1346,4.504098360655738

Delightful touches in the script are Maynard: ""She's absolutely out of control!"" - Tony: ""Is that your typical mother?"" - Rose (being given a silk handkerchief by Maynard when she actually asked for a tissue after having to ""pee""): ""Silk - class!"" - the dumb thug: ""What's his (Rembrant's) address?"" and even the concluding scene, where Maynard's two year old offspring is gently patting the ground with a trowel, when they ask where Snowy the cat's got to.

There are no outright jokes, but there doesn't need to be - the story itself is funny, and so are the characters. This flick doesn't need cheap one-liners to get laughs. You'll be giggling and snickering the whole way.

That being said, this is *dark humor*. Light-hearted dark humor, to be exact. It's unapologetic, doesn't take a moment to be serious, and certainly isn't meant to be any kind of morality tale. Check your scruples at the door if you want to be entertained. Be prepared to find constant kills, thievery, gay undertones, and cat murder, funny - because it is. Here.

We get a nice tour of London and the countryside, lots of cobbled streets and grand old stone buildings and even an old, old wooden house with natural sunlight and very creaky floors.

The main characters are all likable, (even the gentleman assassin) and the wonderful 'family' feeling that grows between them is cute to watch.

What ensues is something of a comedy of errors, while the movie investigates the three characters in great detail. The antagonists are also pretty interesting.
The whole movie maintains a nice pace, although there are rarely moments of actual breathlessness. It is kind of like a comfortable, Saturday morning film that you watch while sipping tea and snacking on cucumber and cream cheese sandwiches. Just pleasant, with quite a few laughs and an attachment to the characters.
In a way, it was kind of a perfect movie. At the end, you feel content and don't really need any more. The stories closes out well, and the length is perfect.

4310614,4,B004AODY3C,"This is a British remake of a French comedy, which a lot of folk have said is much better - well originals nearly always are. I decided to judge this purely on its own merits. A lot of Brit comedy of late has been anything but funny and actually quite poor, this however has real charm and some on screen chemistry that worked for me.

I think it is because of some rather good acting and a wealth of British stars. Bill Nighy plays Victor Maynard, a typically erudite, restrained sort of City gent, who earns his money by being a professional hit man.  He is hired to take out Rosie (Emily Blunt), but after a bungled attempt he sort of starts falling for her womanly charms. Rupert Grint of Harry Potter fame, plays his pot smoking, accidental side kick, and he is really good, I quite liked his character. I think it is because he does it in a nave childish way, yet is convincing. We also have Martin Freeman playing another hit man, though a lot more ruthless.

Fans of Rab C. Nesbitt will be delighted that Gregor Fisher plays a hit man. I've just realised there are quite a few hit persons in this little plot. To top it all of we have Rupert Everett as a play boy nasty, and Bill Nighy's mum turns out to be part of `the family business' too, that of being hired killers.

It is a pretty good romp, with non gratuitous violence and some very good performances. The plot may be a tad ridiculous, but this is a comedy, and I did laugh a number of times.

As I've noted before, I am precisely the audience for comedies about hit men -- as previously proved by&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/You-Kill-Me/dp/B000UAE7KO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">You Kill Me</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Matador/dp/B000EQ5UIC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Matador</a>, and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Grosse-Pointe-Blank/dp/1558908382/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Grosse Pointe Blank</a>&nbsp;-- so I wanted to see WILD TARGET as soon as I knew it existed. And it does what a comedy about hit men has to: it immediately gets the audience on the side of Victor Maynard (Bill Nighy) by immersing us in his world and seeing it through his eyes and his voice. So we want him to continue to succeed in his chosen career -- but that's a problem, since we also see young con artist Rose (Emily Blunt) finagle a complicated double-swap of a counterfeit Rembrandt to a not-quite-crimelord (Everett), and we'd prefer to see her succeed as well, or at least survive.

Unfortunately, they can't both succeed equally, since Everett's character hires Maynard to kill Rose, which he sets off to do in his usual professional manner. But her life is so chaotic and full of unexpected events that he can't quite do it, and, through the sort of unlikely series of events that movies like this are full of, Victor ends up on the run with both Rose and a young man named Tony (Rupert Grint), with another hit man named Dixon (Martin Freeman) after him and Rose. It all ends pretty much the way it should, and goes a lot of enjoyable places along the way.

WILD TARGET is fun and witty and entertaining, though there's something just slightly out-of-focus about it, particularly in Rose's characterization. (She takes risks reflexively, all of the time, just to do dangerous things, and there's no explanation or excuse or payoff for that -- she also asks every man she meets ""how much do you weight,"" which equally leads nowhere.)

4310620,4,B004AODY3C,"*** THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE BLU RAY VERSION ***

I had a feeling from seeing the trailer for ""Wild Target"" that I'd enjoy it - and like many others - I was more than pleasantly surprised.

Jonathan Lynn's 2009 film is a hugely enjoyable romp - a kicking little movie with a very witty and warm script. That it stars the truly scrumptious Emily Blunt is good enough for most guys - but mix in real comedic talent like Bill Nighy, Rupert Everett, Martin Freeman and Gregor Fisher - and you're going to have your funny bones tickled - a lot.

What's also unexpected is the genuine (if unlikely) chemistry between Blunt and Nighy. And while the camera simply adores our Em in every scene she appears in - it's Nighy who's steals the entire film. He is just superb as the twitchy po-faced assassin Victor Maynard still unable to live without his mother and properly pleased with his lifetime of strangulations, poisonings and a good clean bullet in the head (his preferred trademark). His mad upper-crust mother Louisa has even made him a lovely newspaper-clippings memento of all these killings and put them in a scrapbook for his 52nd birthday (how thoughtful). Veteran and classy British actress Eileen Atkins gives an equally scene-stealing performance here too - a great combo with Nighy.

The story goes like his - Ruby (Blunt) falsifies a rare painting, pawns it off on bad guy Rupert Everett for a cool million quid, but gets rumbled. Victor is called in to `remove' said rumbler. But of course he is completely unhinged by the lovely kleptomaniac Rose and their initial mutual loathing eventually develops into something worth fighting for. Rose doesn't need to be extinguished by Victor, but protected by him instead (even if it costs 30,000 a week to do so). And Rupert Grint (Ron Weasley from Harry Potter) is cleverly cast too as the footloose and parentless young lad Tony - who simply gets tangled up in the whole shooting match, but turns out to have natural gun-slinging capabilities - and therefore become the apprentice Victor never had. They form an unlikely trio as (slightly bumbling) professional killers pursue them (Martin Freeman and a very funny Geoff Bell).

Hardly original stuff I know - but as other reviewers have said, I'd rather watch this 'again' than sit through some of the truly awful rom-com pap thrown at us these days by Hollywood. It may not be an oil painting, but it's a bloody good copy mate.

Like ""Tamara Drew"" - ""Wild Target"" is a very likeable British Ealing-Comedy kind of movie - with a great cast and a very, very witty script. It's a good night in and well worth a punt. And the BLU RAY is very cheap too.

I'm off now to dream of lovely Emily and put down the fact that's she's happily married as a minor inconvenience and trivial detail...

4310621,5,B004AODY3C,"The movie as a whole is original and funny. The cast of characters is very diverse and I actually for a minute or two forgot to associate Rupert with Ron Weasley.
Quick summation of the plot: congirl tricks art collector into buying a replica of a Rembrant, he finds out and hires assassin to take her out, the assassin develops feelings for her after observing her daily activities (it's pretty funny to watch her pick pocket and steal without breaking her stride), when he fails to kill her the art collector sends his goons after her to finish the job, the assassin sees her about to get killed by one of the goons and saves her life. Then the story gets a lot more complicated and interesting from there. Ok so maybe it's not THAT original. But it's a really funny different spin on the basic elements of the story.
I will say this though: how is it that every time a classic Mini Cooper is in a movie it seems to always steal my heart?",1302393600,2,940,4.346590909090909

4310623,4,B004AODY3C,"WILD TARGET is a fine example of the way British comedies are made to suceed: take a good script (this film is based on the 1993 French film ""Cible &eacute;mouvante"" by Pierre Salvadori and adapted for the English version by Lucinda Coxon), A director who knows how to pace fun with action (Jonathan Lynn), and cast it with character actors of the caliber of Bill Nighy, Emily Blunt, Rupert Grint, Rupert Everett and Eileen Atkins and the result is bound to be sophisticated farce.  It works every time!

Victor Maynard (Bill Nighy) is a 54-year old professional assassin from a family of professional assassins (the matriarch is Louisa Maynard played to a fare-thee-well by Eileen Atkins) who is unmarried and therefore is leaving no heir to the heritage of his family.  Victor never misses his target - until he is paid to assassinate the kleptomaniac/con artist Rose (Emily Blunt) who is in the midst of swindling the wealthy Ferguson (Rupert Everett) with a fake Rembrandt self portrait.  Rose has her style and as Victor attempts to carry out his assignment he is thwarted by an innocent kid bystander Tony (Rupert Grint) who makes a shot Victor can't ignore - perhaps this ad is the heir apparent to Victor's solitary life.  In a series of fun twists and turns Victor is taken in by both Rose and Tony and the chase between the trio and the henchmen of Ferguson is on.  Yes, the shenanigans are  funny and the cast is terrific in tossing away hilarious lines of dialogue, but true to British form there is also a series of sidebars that are carefully written to give the story a fine sense of human interactions.

It's a nifty concept: a topnotch hit man (Bill Nighy) is hired to kill a habitual sneak thief (Emily Blunt) but botches the job through no fault of his own and not from want of trying.  Other factors simply get in the way, chief of which is a trigger happy witness (Rupert Grint), who thinks he's being trained as an apprentice private detective!  Eileen Atkins is especially good as the hit man's uncompromising mother; it's the family business after all, one has to do things properly.  Less successful is Rupert Everett as the hit man's employer.  He doesn't have enough screen time to evolve into anything other than a type that any actor could have played; they didn't need a ""name"" to do the job.

If you're a fan of sidesplitting british humor, crazy action car chases, and much more, than this movie is for you!
I can honestly sit and watch this movie over and over again and still find it as funny and amazing as the first time I saw it. It's incredible.

4310630,3,B004AODY3C,"Victor Maynard (Bill Nighy) is an erudite, posh gentleman who also happens to be a professional hit man.  Hired to terminate Rosie (Emily Blunt), a pretty young thief, he instead falls for her.  On the run from the men who hired him, they are accompanied by a confused stoner (Rupert Grint) as they hide out till the coast is clear.

I always enjoy the wonderful Bill Nighy and he has many witty scenes early on; unfortunately, none of them are shared with Blunt or Grint.  Blunt's character is thoroughly unlikable and she has no romantic chemistry with Victor; Grint's drifter serves no purpose in the story,  he's awkward, and mumbles his dialogue.  The film starts out promising enough as we watch Victor alone, but once the three come together it's absurd and silly.

This is an okay rental, just don't expect big laughs or a plausible script.",1299542400,9,848,4.727891156462585
4310631,5,B004AODY3C,"I love Dark British Humor.  This has romance, plot twist, and satirical humor.  I love this dry sense of humor.
I was rolling just watching this movie.  I never saw it advertised in the theater, but saw it on a Blu-Ray movie preview and it looked like a fun movie.  I was not disappointed.",1298937600,,289,4.296296296296297
4310632,5,B004AODY3C,The movie was excellent quality.  Didn't care for the movie so much.  Kind funny but a bit too stupid for my taste.,1298592000,,115,4.181818181818182
4310633,4,B004AODY3C,"I'm always tickled when I get the chance to watch a movie without any preconceived notions about whether it will be good or not, few expectations planned for me by either great or poor previews or if its something I've heard nothing of but watch because it arrives in the mail. Such is the case with a movie I've just found one of the funniest I've seen in ages, WILD TARGET.

Bill Nighy stars as Victor Maynard, a professional hit man carrying on the family tradition of being the best in the business. No one has ever seen Maynard or witnessed him commit any murder, even his competition. He is a man who doesn't exist who gets the job done quickly, neatly and efficiently.

At the same time Victor is being hounded by his mother. He's just turned 55 and has yet to have an heir to carry on the family name and business. Having been taught by his father, who will he leave all his knowledge to?

Victor's latest target is a young woman named Rose (Emily Blunt) who has staged an art robbery and the sale of a forgery of a famous Rembrandt painting. Having been paid $900,000 by a wealthy art fancier named Ferguson (Rupert Everett) for the original painting, she switched it out with a copy so that the original could go back to the museum it was located in. Ferguson wasn't too happy about being swindled though so he's hired Victor to kill Rose in 24 hours.

But things don't always go as planned. Victor tracks down Rose but with each attempt on her life something stops him. Be it someone stepping out from a shop or finding a man slipping into her bed, something always gets in the way. And just as he's about to get the job done in a parking garage, one of Ferguson's henchmen gets in the middle of it and Victor kills him for interfering. When the second henchman gets the drop on Victor, a young drifter named Tony (Rupert Grint) shoots him giving the trio an opportunity to vacate before they're arrested.

Realizing she's in danger, Rose offers Victor $30,000 to be her bodyguard. Interested in seeing where this goes, Victor takes the job and begins to do what he does best, avoid being detected. Unfortunately Rose isn't a willing participant in the endeavor instead doing things that draw more attention to them instead of keeping them under the radar. Not a good thing to do since Ferguson has hired the second best hit man in the business to finish the job.

As the story moves forward, Victor seems to think that Tony has a natural ability for firearms after having seen him shoot someone using a weapon for the first time. Realizing this, he takes Tony under his wing with promises of teaching him the trade. Although he doesn't tell him he's a killer, telling him he's a detective instead.

An attraction between Rose and Victor develops through the series of events that unfold. This wayward young woman who no one has ever stood up for or protected begins to feel deep emotions for the first person who has ever done so, Victor. And in Rose, Victor sees perhaps a chance at life, something he willingly kept away from in his plastic covered home in the country, the location he chooses to protect Rose and Tony in. But eventually we know the bad guys will show up, truth will be revealed and the outcome will be unpredictable.

Sounds pretty straight forward, right? Well the fact is that it isn't. In reading the synopsis one would think this is a hard core action film with plenty of bloodshed. But it isn't. Instead it's a dark comedy that ranks among some of the funniest I've ever seen. Everything from a potential witness to murder in the form of a parrot to banged up bad guys done so in the oddest ways possible fill this film with tons of laughter. Then again I have a twisted sense of humor so that helps.

Nighy does a great job here as he does in nearly everything I've ever seen him in. Blunt is an attractive young actress who gives more depth than her years would make one believe. And Grint, finally doing something outside of HARRY POTTER offers a good job as a potential assistant to Nighy.

The movie was much funnier than I expected it to be. I actually found myself laughing out loud a number of times. This is a movie that you could enjoy the first time around and perhaps even a second or third time. While you may not decide to buy this one, it is definitely one of the best titles around worth the money to rent. Give it a go.",1298505600,3,4373,4.434620174346202
4310634,5,B004AODY3C,"I rented this movie, watched it, laughed hysterically, and immediately went on Amazon to purchase it, as in while the credits were rolling. Bill Nighy is superb as always, he really nails physical comedy and wit with perfect subtlety. Emily Blunt is also awesome, as usual, creating depth and dimension in a character that could come off as one-note if left in the wrong hands. Rupert Grint is trying to have a career after Harry Potter, and more power to him. Yes, he is a little shaky and new, but it works for his character and there are some real gemstone one-liners that he delivers hilariously. Oh, and Rupert Everett, though his role is somewhat small and shallow, is as charming as ever. This film does not take itself too seriously, nor should it, as it is an awesome dark(ish) comedy that succeeds where many contemporary movies fail. I highly recommend picking it up and seeing for yourself. A+ from me.

Sidenote: For all you fashion-minded folks out there, Emily Blunt's wardrobe is AMAZING in this film.",1298332800,,1017,4.745762711864407
4310635,1,B004AODY3C,"I bought it specifically because of Rupert Grint. You know what? He looked better in Harry Potter movies 'cause in ""Wild target"" he looks dump and awkward, always smoking drag or doing nothing with empty look in his eyes. Grim humor takes place through the whole movie. I did not see that anyone in my family laughed including me - mostly chuckles ironically. I do not know who wrote all 5* reviews (must be English people) but movie worth 1* no more. Bill Nighy - bad play. He got a first role but he does not fit for it. I'd rather give him a maid role (eyes - down, no emotions at all). Emily Blunt - good work! You made me believe in that character. She almost made me hate her - means she was totally in this role.
The movie about assassin (Bill Nighy) who kills in cold blood his targets. His mom supports his deeds. But she also wants grandchildren. So Bill couldn't kill his next target because he liked her (Emily Blunt) even if she was a thief and she kept stilling everything what was in her sight through the whole movie. Some bum (Rupert Grint) shows up suddenly when Bill failed to kill his target and his replacement (the other killers) intended to finish it. Rupert's interruption prevented target killing (Emily). Then all three of them Emily, Rupert and Bill run away throw whole movie. In the end they killed their killers buried them in Bill's home yard, Emily marred with Bill and their 4 years son buried their favorite cat in the same yard (leaving you in guess how he killed him).  Well if this is fan for you ... you may laugh now.
Do not buy it just because of Rupert Grint. You won't enjoy it.",1297987200,5,1620,4.364238410596027
