4209248,5,B003VG515Y,"I hink the movie is very good when Sarah Thompon meets William Whitfield the Duke of Whitfield on her tip to Europe with her parents after her divorce from a bad marriage from Fred van Deering.
I like the part when William and Sarah got married and started a family. I did not like the part when William was in the army and Sarah wa left alone to raise Philip along with her unborn child she is expecting which she died of influenza wen it was not any medicine to take care of her and also when William was in a wheelchair and also died of a heart attck. Sarah was left alone to raise her children and to take care of the jewelry store which she and William has opened up in the different locations after the war.
I like the part when her childtren have grown to get married and to have a family of their own and to also celebrate her 75th birthday and when she also ran into an old friend from her childhood.",1352332800,,909,4.112359550561798

The Movie which I have seen before is WONDERFUL so please do not allow my 1 star to deter you from buying it. Again 1star is for DVD quality and to think I paid for 2 day for this junk. NOT a happy customer at all.

I really enjoyed the movie, it is #3 on my list of favorites just after Gone With the Wind and its sequel, Scarlett. Highly recommended!! The movie came all on 1 DVD, thank goodness, I hate when I have to get up and switch DVD's.",1462233600,3,479,4.052631578947368
