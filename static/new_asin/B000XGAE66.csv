8611093,2,B000XGAE66,"Despite the modern and very ""toony"" appearance of the characters on the cover of this DVD's package, this DVD is a collection of seven doggie cartoons dating from 1935 to 1949. I had never seen any of them before and some of them are actually quite good. Most of the short films are in dire need of restoration. There are some very obvious signs of wear & tear from the films and some of the dialogue is difficult to understand.

  The package looks like it comes from Wal-Mart's $1.00 bargain DVD rack. I paid a little over $6.00 for it and, frankly, it's not worth that much. I found some of these videos readily available at YouTube. Oh well, now I have them on DVD.

  This DVD contains the following cartoons:

* ""A Self-Made Mongrel"" (1945)
* ""A Mutt in a Rut (1949)
* ""Boy Meets Dog"" (1938)
* ""Pudgy Takes a Bow-Wow"" (1937)
""Scotty Finds a Home"" (1935) (Note how the name is spelled. It's not spelled ""Scottie"", as the DVD's packaging suggests. No wonder why I couldn't find it anywhere online.
* ""Doggone Tired"" (1949)
* ""Play Safe"" (1936)

  Overall, this collection of cartoons is good, but they might be too dated for most folks' tastes. Total run time is 59:12.",1241568000,,1173,4.464788732394366
