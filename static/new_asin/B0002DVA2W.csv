2080933,4,B0002DVA2W,"My children and I love to watch Donutman. The movies are short (25 min) and the music gets the kids attention.  The songs are so catchy, you'll be singing them for days!! The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because there was a short part of the Resurrection Celebration video where there were some scratch lines on the screen (from the first time I opened it and watched it)",1366934400,,382,4.305555555555555

We have all of the DVD's and highly recommend them to people who like good clean christian songs/shows for their kids.  Good biblical lessons and songs. My kids are now teenagers and they still love the Donut Man.  I can't wait till I have grandchildren to spoil with the DVD's,1360713600,,355,4.603174603174603

Our daughter claps along, and tries to do the motions to the songs! She gets so excited whenever we turn ""Donut Man"" on! I appreciate that his videos have positive messages about Jesus Christ and teach good values! What more could you ask for in a video?!?! :-) I highly recommend these videos!!!",1360713600,2,428,4.644736842105263
2080936,5,B0002DVA2W,I bought this cd for my 3yrs and 4yrs old girls. They love music and I want them to listern to fun and music that will minister good message to them.

2080941,5,B0002DVA2W,"My 2 preschool age girls LOVE this DVD. They ask to watch it almost everyday. The best part is that they are learning Biblical theology without even knowing it.

2080955,5,B0002DVA2W,"We had The Donut Man videos when our children were young. Now our grandchildren are singing and dancing to the DVDs and they are only 1 1/2 to 3 years old! It really blesses my heart to know they are learning the truths of God's Word as they have fun acting out Bible stories. My favorite is when our 3 year old grandson, Lucas, acts out David and Goliath!  Or when our whole family sings ""Life without Jesus is like a donut "" while dancing with Rob Evans (the Donut. Man). It is fun for the whole family!!",1406592000,3,506,4.163265306122449
