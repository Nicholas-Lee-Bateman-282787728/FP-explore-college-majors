8368723,3,B002ASAFHS,"Cons: as other reviewers have said, the quality is poor. Home video w/o melody or any fancy background. Some tunes are off.

Pros: my 16-mon son's favorite video. Whenever i put it on, he would watch with his full attention. I guess the simplicity helps in some way. Many books don't support the idea to let child below two years old watch TV,but I feel comfortable to show him this video because it shows a ex-daycare teacher singing/acting without any flashy background.

So in spite of the low quality, I still recommend this video because my son loves it.

BTW: you can find more video online at Cullen's website. So you don't have to buy a DVD since you can view them online. It is more convenient to have a DVD on hand though.",1332201600,,732,4.447761194029851
8368724,1,B002ASAFHS,"This set of product is a total joke. It is homemade video with very poor graphic and sound quality (actually there is no music, just this lady talking and singing, and her singing skill is below average). The DVD did include many of the popular songs, which is the only reason my kids watched it for 10 minutes.
Don't waste your money on this.",1320969600,,343,4.375
8368725,3,B002ASAFHS,"My three year old grandson loves Cullen's videos, but I have to force myself to watch them with him.  Cullen is energetic and presents herself in a way that is very engaging with kids.

However, she can't carry a tune!  I try to sing along, and sometimes it's so far off the melody is gone. This takes most of the joy out of sharing the songs with him. He doesn't know the difference, though. I guess that's what really matters.",1260230400,,428,4.325
