Read the reviews above...I worked on the movie, so it would not be right to review it myself! But I must tell you, COMPLICITY will have you on the edge of your seat the entire time. Great direction by CB Harding and all the young actors are terrific in this thriller. Complicity won two awards at The Boston International Film Festival for Best Screenplay and Best Cinematography. Please check this out!

5856896,1,B00DUUC104,"I rarely use the ""one star"" it could have gotten two, but the ending on top of this pile of nonsense was, wasted. So you have these vague like introductions, typical high school teenagers, gearing up and getting ready for college. Then they have a last minute party and things aren't what they seem. What happens in this movie happens around 35 minutes in, before this you virtually get a slew of stupid high school nonsense that could easily have been suggested, instead of telling more about the characters, they make them one dimensional, so you truly don't feel anything for any single one of them. This is a movie were nothing is explained, but the most mundane, lame i could have figured this out in ten seconds stuff, is included.
The next part may contain spoilers, i highlighted the character list for you, so you know... i could get out some post-movie angst.
Like for example here's a character index, Girl who all:i'm privileged and drunk and that offends me!... Boy who is all ""my dad is the worst, i lost the game, rage rage rage"". . A Girl who is ""i'm slightly goth punk, and i have issues with treating others like crap for reasons that will never be explained. Boy who is: I'm that rage-y guys friend, we play football, i'm the darn smartest character in this movie"". Girl who is all i'm rich, your not, maybe something happened to me, maybe something didn't, but you all will pay. and Boy that is basically , i'm mysterious, described as creepy, but no one understands me, because if they understood me, they wouldn't be asking.
Also, there is a scene in this movie that goes into some Traumatic stuff happening., but they made it super sexual, which is never explained, but at the same time, it was unnecessary to be filmed in such a glossy way, and not glossy as in, they skipped over it, i mean filters, changing perspectives, just a bunch of junk. (total spoiler) with how the movie ended, they could have alluded to it happening, and never showed us a thing and it would have been more effective, so, boo to you director, you messed up.",1453939200,8,2059,4.537634408602151
5856897,1,B00DUUC104,"This movie is not worth watching even if you were paid to do so. The story line is horrible. Pointless script with a crappy dialog. I couldn't wait for this movie to end. Why I get sucked into buying this are the previews. It LOOKED interesting...but as they say..the previews show the best part. After watching this mess I couldn't figure out what were the best parts of this waste of time. There were NO good parts. How the found a way to sucker me into this is still a mystery to me.

The movie never did get interesting. The actors were no one I have ever heard of and probably got paid $100.00 to be in this farce. And even a hundred bucks would be to much. As my title states...total POS. Avoid at all costs.",1446336000,,714,4.211678832116788

I could not tell you names because I didn't care enough to find out. The story is we have a party, all the popular kids are there and some no so populars too. One of the girls may or may not have been raped and she of course points out a not too popular strange boy (it seems that she has issues). The football guy roughs him up, just about everyone joins in and well,  things happen and I'm sure you can figure it out from there.

This is a very real and very possible. This is a highly intelligent film with depth and insight.

Using the clever choice of words at the end of the film to descried the victims thought process for doing what he/she did and who he/she chose to target for their rage was to little to late to bring the story full circle. Some questioned the flashbacks and what they meant and I would just say that that was the cause of his/her problems and he/she felt helpless and used the other victim as the source of rage. If you couple that with the group mentality of the friends you wind up with what plays out in the movie. The movie came across as a convoluted mess the way the story is told and it lost most of its effectiveness.
There is a fair amount of violence (fighting) and a for the most part a implied rape scene (no nudity) with drug and alcohol use and cursing (maybe even the fword), but is fairly tame for the targeted age group.
The movie had some good production values except for the writing and some of the cast performances were below par.

It's a solid film with trauma, violence, secrets, and much more. The characters are in high school and attend a party at which there are no adults. The movie is not a slasher, but is violent.

There was a hallucination in which an adult male with glasses was in the room. Let's see...the weird boy has been weird since something traumatic happened to him last fall.  Could it be that he was sexually abused and raped the girl? or was it just the breakup with his teenage love? How about the girl who was promiscuous (to say the least), was she screaming rape because of a past experience in which she was sexually assaulted by an older male?
