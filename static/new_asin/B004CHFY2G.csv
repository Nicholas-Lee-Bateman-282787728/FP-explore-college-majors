4327191,5,B004CHFY2G,"Hi Folks,

After I purchased the Gibson Learn and Master Guitar Course and I saw the production quality and teaching standard they employ, I ordered the L&M Setup and Maintenance 3-DVD Set as well. It covers setup and routine maintenance on both Electric and Acoustic type guitars. The instructions are clear and well illustrated and just a few setups that you perform to keep your sound in tip top order will more than save you the cost of the DVD set if you had to take your guitar to a music store and have their technician do the setup for you. Great value.",1334793600,2,561,4.446601941747573
4327192,5,B004CHFY2G,"I have been using other learn and master programs, specifically, guitar and I wish I had purchased this a year ago when I started. This program, if followed closely, will allow you to do basic maintenance and adjustments on your acoustic or electric guitar. If you're like me and are afraid that you will damage your precious guitar then this is a great start to learning how to do SOME of your own maintenance. Let me be clear that this is not a substitute for periodic maintenance by a professional to adjust saddle height (although that is covered in the dvds) or the nut (which the dvd suggests to always have looked at by a pro). If you like to change your strings 3-4 times a year or more, or you like to keep your guitar well maintained to get the best tones from it but you want to save yourself the time and money of dropping it off at the guitar shop then this is an easy choice. You will learn about setups on electric, acoustic, and arch top guitars, what tools are needed, how to change the strings, basic cleaning, and how to make adjustments to the guitar. A great buy!!!",1327708800,5,1086,4.354679802955665

8423017,2,B004CHFY2G,"I purchased this DVD course directly from the vendor, not from Amazon.

I am a new guitarist with one electric 6-string guitar and one acoustic 6-string guitar.  I purchased this course hoping to learn enough to perform the most common guitar maintenance tasks myself.

Early on, the course looked very promising for a beginner, since it starts out naming each part of the guitar.  Unfortunately, as it gets in to the real meat of the processes, the teacher glosses over many critical steps.  2 examples: 1. when describing how to set up the pickups on an electric guitar, he says to measure from the string to the pickup, and tells you the measurement.  What he does not tell you is where on the pickup, and where on the string.  Does he mean from the center of the string? Top, bottom? And where on the pickup? The body? The pickup cores?  2. When showing setting the intonation and tuning, he uses a technique on the string to get it to ring the harmonic an octave above the main string value.  He does this in the video, but never discusses or mentions it.  I found that confusing, and had to do 3 hours of research to understand what he was doing.  Im still confused, as there are many conflicting opinions on the Internet.  I would have hoped the video would cover this.

There is a lot of information coming at you pretty quickly in the videos.  There are no printed materials accompanying the course.  So when you are setting up your guitar, you have to find and re-watch the pertinent sections.  A short, printed process overview with measurements would have helped immensely here.

Overall, the videos are of decent quality, and I learned quite a bit about guitar setup.  I would be reluctant to try on an expensive guitar though.  The videos just aren't specific enough.

I think maybe a more experienced guitarist would get more useful information from these videos than I did.",1425340800,4,1889,4.632530120481928
8423018,5,B004CHFY2G,"Greg Voros is a master at what he does, and it shows. Anyone who has a guitar they care about would do well to get this DVD set and watch carefully.",1387929600,,148,3.806451612903226
8423019,3,B004CHFY2G,"I'm a little disappointed in this. The lessons are fine if you're just starting out and need to learn some basic techniques to restring, clean and setup your guitar to be able to start playing. But it's nothing you can't find on google or youtube for free. He does cover the most common types of setups for electrics and acoustics.
While I'm sure Greg is really good at his trade, he doesn't really dig in and explain much about why he is doing this or that, you basically just copy his actions and hope for the best. Also the camera angles aren't always that good which leaves you to figure out some things on your own.

Still, it's nice to have the information on a set of dvd's in good video and audio quality, instead of having to sift through videos on youtube. And you can be sure you'll be doing the right things because you get it straight from a master. And the price is fair as well.",1385164800,,893,4.284023668639053
8423020,5,B004CHFY2G,"Excellent and easy to understand information, presented in a simple straight forward way that is easy to follow.  Will save a lot of money on standard guitar maintenance.",1360281600,,170,5.071428571428571
8423021,2,B004CHFY2G,"This glossy basic approach and terminology for beginners may be suitable. But for a 3 DVD set and the word ""Master your setup"" I expected more substance. After covering the basics and he just starts to touch on the DIY details Greg punts and instructs you to take it to a trained professional technician. What? Give me a break! If Greg is going to include the word ""master"" in the title immerse yourself with some substance or at least get your hands dirty. Disappointed to say the least!

If you are looking for more details try Stewart Macdonalds pitchman Dan Erlewines DVD series especially his 3 dvd series on fretting. Greg has a section for fretting but completely ignored any specific details. Next time Greg at least include some nice close up graghics or diagrams of what a crown should look like or neck relief.
I hope this helps in your decision process.",1359849600,27,865,4.65359477124183

I have paid for many setups of new and older guitars and with the Learn & Master Guitar Setup and Maintenance set, I feel comfortable doing these things myself.  A good buy for anyone that owns a guitar.",1357171200,,243,4.377777777777778
