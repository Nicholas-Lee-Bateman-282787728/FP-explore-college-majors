8349959,5,B0023S49PY,"I first watched the ""new"" series and was hooked so decided to check out the ""old"" series. I was happy to find that it's just as well written and McManus is a better lead. The bodies fall like autumn leaves but Taggart plows on. Sometimes I have to rewind to decipher ""Oh, och aye"" but it is definitely worth it. Because each episode is over 2 hours long, there's plenty of time for introducing enough secondary characters that I really don't know who did it until Taggart does. A very well-done series and worth the price.",1303948800,2,522,4.447916666666667
8349960,5,B0023S49PY,"Although I was born in the USA, as were my parents, I had the good fortune to have grown up in a neighborhood comprised of immigrants from England, Ireland and Scotland. It is not easy to understand the variations in Scotch ""English"" unless you hear it spoken and listen very carefully. Once you get beyond ""Listening"", you can begin to recognize how well written the Taggart series is. Over time individuals develop characters. You begin to enjoy the humor and wit which makes this such a popular show in Scotland. This series, like the others demonstrate the ongoing shuffle of the main characters as they receive promotions and take on different responsibilities. There are plenty of murders in this series. One wonders if there are any people left in that country. Poor old Taggart. He is never happy. But he does enjoy his work and making sly witty comments to his crew. To those who would like to have English sub-titles I say listen carefully. Don't have distractions when you are watching. I used to watch these shows on television in this country and I was very happy to find them on DVD.",1266883200,3,1097,4.689119170984456
8349961,5,B0023S49PY,"The owners of this series had fans wait what 3 or 4 years since release of the last sets in this series? Well better late than never. I love this series and I was not disappointed.

I don't like the fact that there is no closed captioning, can't these people get with the times? Even with the lack of CC I doubt that hard core fans will be deterred. I can't wait for the next 3 sets in June. I hope we don't have to wait another 3 to 4 years for release of future sets in the series.",1243468800,3,483,3.878787878787879
