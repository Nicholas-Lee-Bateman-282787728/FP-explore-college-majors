8243488,5,B00120LPM4,"John Cena VS JBL: Nothing will ever top there match Judgment Day 2005 match, that was just plain awesome. This was a pretty good match but nothing like three years ago. Cena wins out of nowhere with an F-U in a good opener.

Kane and CM Punk VS Miz and Morrison: They show The Dirt Sheet by Miz and Morrison before this event, pretty funny stuff. Three of the future main eventers in WWE and Kane, who is stale beyond belief. This was a really good tag team match-up, lots of action. CM Punk looked good towards the end but Morrison hits Moonlight Drive for the win as Kane choke slams Miz on the outside.

Chris Jericho VS Shawn Michaels: If these two men every had a bad match against each other, please let me know. A classic match with an awesome ending and they shook hands in the end. I would have liked the see HBK win the IC title but this was a non-title match for no reason.

Beth Phoenix VS Melina VS Mickie James: All three women can wrestle but I still skip over all women matches.

Edge VS Undertaker: This was a pretty good back and fourth match-up. Undertaker wins the world title via count-out but Vickie comes out and says the title is vacant. I hate Vickie, I hate Edge, and would rather forget this.

MVP VS Jeff Hardy: MVP comes out and brags that he has held the US title longer then anyone else. Considering he won the belt from Chris Beniot, no wonder WWE never talked about the title. A good back and fourth match with the usual botch spots by Hardy. Hardy wins in the end with a move that i've never how it damages opponents, whisper in the wind.

Triple H VS Randy Orton: Wow, its June 20th 2009 and this damn feud is still going on. I never understand why WWE started the you can pin your opponent in a cage stipulation. This was a pretty good match overall with Triple H winning in the end. JR asks if these two could be the same after the match and I can answer truthfully, yes. IT'S STILL GOING ON!

William Regal looked on thru out the whole event for some reason.

Overall, a decent event. Micheals-Jericho stole the show and the main event was pretty good. I'd diffently buy this dvd.",1245456000,,2118,4.2775

8243490,4,B00120LPM4,"John Cena vs. J.B.L. - Wow, Cena in the opening match of a PPV?  That's the first time in almost 4 years.  Cena injured his shoulder early the match revolved around J.B.L. just working on Cena's shoulder & his ribs with Cena having to rely on his power.  This wasn't a ""get the crowd fired up"" opener as it had a slow pace to it but if you can get past that & the ""out of nowhere"" FU finish, this was actually a good match between the two & as I stated, their second best match they've when compared to the other three that I've seen from them (haven't seen the Bash match yet)...with the first one being at this exact same PPV 3 years earlier.

WWE Tag Team Champions John Morrison & The Miz vs. Kane & CM Punk - A short match that was very good mix with all four men putting on good performances with the only draw back being that they weren't given more time.

Shawn Michaels vs. Chris Jericho - Eventhough this match didn't have the emotional story attachment to like their previous one, this match is right up there with their WM19 match in my opinion as they performed such a great wrestling match with each man countering each other's moves & even displaying a couple of rarely seen moves like Jericho's own mix of an indian...oops, I mean ""native american"" deathlock & a figure four and HBK doing an armbar while hanging over the top to yank the arm down.  One heavily athletic contest.

Womens Champion Mickie James vs. Beth Phoenix vs. Melina - This match was too short (around 5 mins.) to really turn into anything special but it was a nice match for what it was.  The real moment to check out is the double backbreaker on Mickie & Melina by Beth...that was heavily impressive.

World Heavyweight Championship Match: Undertaker vs. Edge - Just like their matches at WrestleMania & Backlash, this was a match that just got better as it went on with great wrestling & countering/kicking out of each other's holds back & forth with the story of Undertaker not allowed to use ""that choke hold"" coming into play during the match.  I can say that these two have not had a bad one on one match & this is no exception if you can get past the ending.

Jeff Hardy vs. MVP - Well, we get a bonus match here.  For the most part, MVP grounded Jeff from doing his daredevil offense & worked on his arm to the point where Jeff went for a leapfrog out the corner & dropped straight to the floor because of the bad arm.  In the end, Jeff gets the win ""out of nowhere"" with the Wisper In The Wind(that he barely connected with for anyone paying close attention).

Steel Cage Match: WWE Champion Triple H vs. Randy Orton - This was one of those steel cages that wasn't a bloody hardcore massacre but still a that got intense at certain moments with a chair even getting involved later on in the bout.  Another good match between the two but it doesn't top the earlier matches in their series.

In the end, this was the best overall Judgment Day card since the 2001 edition.  There wasn't a real bad match on here, nothing really to skip over, and the only drawbacks being that some matches could have went longer than they did.  In the end, this is one you should go out of your way to see based on the inring action that will leave you satisfied & I highly recommend.",1217289600,2,3260,4.325123152709359

John Cena V. JBL
Interesting placement on this card. It didn't seem like this match should be first and it was a little weird seeing Cena in the opener. Good match here with JBL destroying Cena for the whole match so whatever psychology they had made they lost when cena hitting the FU out of nowhere for the win. **1/2 Seems like their WrestleMania 21 match.

WWE Tag Team Championship:
John Morrison & The Miz (Champions) V. CM Punk & Kane
Good match here too. Good wrestling but Punk & Morrison which is weird because their single matches together in 2007 sucked. Anywhere, Morrison and Miz retain in a good match but nothing realy noteworthly here. **3/4. The commentary by Mike Adamle was just horrible. Like ""Miz & Morrison won the titles in November and had hold them for 5 months""...WHAT?? Ok, the PPV was hold in May which is the fifth month of the year. But they won them in November, so they actually hold them for seven months at this point. Good adding there Mike. Another awesome line was: ""CM Punk with the right hand just kicked Morrison in the head""...WOW...I'm not going to even touch that one.

Shawn Michaels V. Chris Jericho
This was a really good match, but was also disappointing. This match just seemed to be missing something. realy good match with god wreslting and storyline but again was missing something to push it over the top. Michaels wins. ***1/2

Triple Threat Match for thr WWE Women's Championship:
Mickie James (Champion) V. Beth Phoenix V. Melina
Really good womens match here. Good stroy to it and some cool spots. Mickie retains. ***

Vacant World Heavyweight Championship:
Undertaker V. Edge
Very, very good. not as good as WrestleMania, but still good. Cheap finish that fits well with the storyline. Taker wins by countout, but you can't win a Championship by countout or disqualification so, the title is still Vacant. Interesting. ***3/4

MVP V. Jeff Hardy
Bonus match here at Judgment Day and it was good. Just good. Good finish here with Hardy winning. ***1/4

Steel Cage Match for the WWE Championship:
Triple H (Champion) V. Randy Orton
Better than what people give it credit for but it could ahve been better. Again, very good cage match but the effort just didn't seem to be there. Triple H wins. ***3/4

A Good PPV, but it seemed to be missing something the whole night. The effort just didn't seem to be there. Definitly watchable, but just didn't have that something special to push it over the top to make it special.",1216252800,,2534,4.704288939051919

This Year For WWE Has been real well all their pay-per-views have been great and this one was no exception

Win: Triple H
9.5/10

Well this is my review for Judgment Day 2008 it was the best Judgment Day i've seen since 2005 so it's good to see wwe is back on the right track",1212192000,,2254,4.081447963800905
8243493,4,B00120LPM4,"JUDGMENT DAY has always been a weird PPV event for the WWE:
*  Undertaker making a big debut and accidentally helping his rival win?
*  Eric Bischoff throwing up on the crowd?
*  Kurt Angle getting a permanent haircut?
*  Kurt Angle getting pinned in 60 seconds?
*  Undertaker getting pinned clean?
*  HBK getting squashed?

Yeah, I usually don't bother to watch a JUDGMENT DAY PPV broadcast.  But for the 10th edition, I took a chance.  It's not perfect, but I think WWE still scored big this time around.

There's lots of good stuff to write about, so here goes:

1) JBL v. John Cena
---In Cena's first PPV opener since WRESTLEMANIA XX, this was actually the toughest one to call.  Remember WRESTLEMANIA 21, where JBL dominated Cena for most of the match, then lost out of nowhere?  Tonight was an encore of that evening.  The difference is that JBL implemented a very solid ground-grappling strategy, so I didn't mind the one-sided battle too much.  The Omaha crowd was generous with the slow pace, and didn't chant ""Boring"" until about 15 minutes in.  But just like 3 years ago in Hollywood, Cena's sudden victory got a lukewarm reaction --- not a good sign.  I kinda got into this opener, but you better be sitting in your most comfortable chair, because this one might test people's patience.
""6.5 out of 10""
---------------------------------------------------------------

2) WWE Tag Team Championships
John Morrison & The Miz (WWE Tag Team champions) v.
CM Punk (Mr. Money-In-The-Bank) & Kane (ECW champion)
---First off, every title bout got in-ring introductions, which I think is a classy move on WWE's part.  As for the match, I'm convinced that Morrison and Punk can do just about anything if given the chance.  Kane and Miz can be good singles competitors, but they're much better at tag team action.  So I had high hopes for this one.  Turns out that ECW's only presence on the PPV was a good one, but could've been better.  The champions showed some good teamwork, and the challengers are a pairing I enjoy watching.  The only problem is that the match was a tad short and had a weak finish.  Overall it's good stuff, but these guys deserved more than the 8 minutes they got.  One more thing, congrats to Mike Adamle for having a botch-free evening.  I might grow to like him, after all.
""7.0 out of 10""
---------------------------------------------------------------

3) Chris Jericho (Intercontinental champion) v. Shawn Michaels
---The bad news is that this grudge match wasn't nearly as good as their WRESTLEMANIA XIX showdown, which is one of the greatest matches of all time.  The good news is that this 2008 contest is one of the year's best matches, and is probably JUDGMENT DAY's greatest to date.  This storyline is as gray as it gets.  I didn't really know who the good guy is, the crowd didn't know who to cheer for, and I don't even think JR & King knew who to push either.  HBK and Jericho don't repeat the same spots used 5 years ago; instead, this one had its own story and unique psychology.  I think most of us were looking forward to this one the most.  You won't be disappointed --- it's 20 minutes of excellence!
""9.0 out of 10""
---------------------------------------------------------------

4) Women's Championship
Beth Phoenix v. Melina v. Mickie James (champion)
---Thank God this wasn't a lazy Diva effort.  These women showed some sweet moves and interesting storytelling.  Did you know Phoenix could lift both women at the same time?  I sure didn't.  I wish they got more than 5 minutes, because this was solid from bell to bell.  I hope that this is a sign of greater things to come.
""7.0 out of 10""
---------------------------------------------------------------

5) World Heavyweight Championship (vacant)
Edge v. The Undertaker
---Before I review this match, I want to first paraphrase Bret Hart's thoughts on his classic Owen Hart Tribute Match against Chris Benoit:

""What's interesting is that when you first watch it, the fans are kinda just sitting back, wondering if it's gonna pick up or not.  Then as you watch the tape, you can see them kinda lean forward a bit.  And then by the end, they're on their feet cheering and getting really into it.  I always thought wrestling was better when it was slower, like a real fight.  The pace shouldn't always be at a high; it should start slow and then gradually pick up.""  [shoot interview in Yonkers, NY - 2001]

Hitman's philosophy is the key to why Edge and Taker have delivered on three consecutive PPVs.  Edge and Taker haven't resorted to fast-paced action or crazy spots.  They aren't afraid to let us start off quiet, and then only stand on our feet towards the end.  That type of patient wrestling is a bold attempt from these two, and I give them a ton of credit for challenging our expectations, and succeeding every time.  Some might will be mad that this ended with a screwjob finish, where neither man won the belt.  But even though I paid 40 bucks on PPV, I didn't feel too mad about it.  I knew Jericho/HBK was going to be great, but this was a more pleasant surprise.
""8.0 out of 10""
---------------------------------------------------------------

6) MVP v. Jeff Hardy
---This RAW/SmackDown contest started with MVP complaining about not having a match, which Matt Hardy then let his brother give him one.  This PPV bonus was very similar to the JBL/Cena opener, with Hardy getting little offense in.  The difference is that MVP got the crowd more into it.  I wish the match weren't so one-sided, but I liked how it cooled me down between main events.
""6.5 out of 10""
---------------------------------------------------------------

7) Steel Cage Match - WWE Championship
Randy Orton v. Triple H (champion)
---I read so much about why this was a pointless rematch, because we know who was going to win.  But that's like saying James Bond movies suck because he always stops the bad guy.  Orton and HHH have consistently put on solid performances, and although this one stalled a bit at first, it's one of their best.  Even the entrances were a thrill, because each guy's music and body language got us pumped.  The Steel Cage Match does include the usual throws and escape attempts, but none of it felt stale to me.  Sure, I had to suspend disbelief a few times.  All that Cage action, but no bloodshed?  Why climb over the top when you can use the door?  Who put that chair by the Cage door, anyway?  But when the action was this good, I stopped asking those questions and just went along for the ride.  I wasn't really looking forward to this one, but these 25 minutes were more than worth my time.
""7.5 out of 10""
---------------------------------------------------------------

OVERALL
---JUDGMENT DAY 2008 is probably the best of the 10 PPVs in the series.  There were no stupid gimmicks, pointless comedy sketches, or confusing booking decisions.  There are few backstage interviews and promos, and they were a pleasure to watch.  This PPV was meant for fans who just want to see physical competition; on those grounds, JUDGMENT DAY 2008 succeeded.  WWE has been on a roll since October, and if this quality of presentation keeps up, we could see their best work since the initial brand split.",1211068800,5,7216,4.821515892420538
