1624741,5,B00005MEV2,"This is the best comedy that I have seen this year, and also the funniest! David Spade plays a redneck on a search for his long lost parents. This movie has many funny moments, including a spoof of ""The Silence of the Lambs"" that is just hilarious! This is David Spade's best comedy since ""Tommy Boy"".

1624800,2,B00005MEV2,"How arrogant and self-centered can one bad comic be? Written by D.Spade and stars D.Spade.
Did not laugh one single time at anything David Spade did. Laughed one time at a comment made by a spectator.
One laugh for what could have been a hilarious 1.5 hour movie is certainly not worth the time. I watched all of it, after a long break in the middle, cuz I believed it would have to get better and be funny. Nope.

But I don't believe the prepubescent humor is funny. This guy actually thinks having lunch room food thrown at him is funny to watch. If you do, you might really like this movie cuz it is FULL of stupid stunts like that.",1508198400,,635,4.24793388429752

1625102,2,B00005MEV2,"Joe Dirt is a Cinderella story muddied and soiled by crass humor, tasteless visual images, and a puerile sense of what constitutes funny. The title character (David Spade) works as a janitor at a Los Angeles radio station. After being abandoned by his parents at the Grand Canyon at the age of 8, Joe sets out to find his parents. Enroute, he manages to get himself into unlikely, contrived situations. Spades Joe is an innocent, and is supposed to elicit sympathy as he navigates a world that has not been kind to him.

Wigged in an exaggerated mullet, which is one of the movies main sight gags, Spade goes through an awful script with trooper determination to get to the end credits in one piece. From his work on Saturday Night Live and his talent for creating characters, we know Spade is capable of far better than what this sad excuse for comedy offers.

Jokes and sight gags are scatter gunned with little cohesion. Celebrity cameos by Dennis Miller, Kid Rock, Kevin Nealon, and Adam Beach do little to shore up the comedy. Christopher Walken co-stars as Clem, a very strange school janitor, and neatly steals the picture. Walken is unique among todays actors. His mere presence can elicit smiles, and hes very funny here, illustrating how weak and desperate the rest of the movies comedy is.

Bonus features on this new-to-Blu-ray release include commentary with director Dennie Gordon and David Spade, outtakes, blooper reel, deleted scenes, original theatrical trailer, and the featurette Joe Dirt - The Return: The Making of Joe Dirt 2: Beautiful Loser.",1435708800,,1565,4.87593984962406

1625226,5,B00005MEV2,"Is this ""The Godfather"", ""The Right Stuff"", or ""Good Will Hunting""?

No.

However, ""Joe Dirt"" is the #2 best bad movie out there (#1 going to ""Tremors"", both starring Fred Ward, who was also in ""The Right Stuff"").  David Spade's shtick as the cranky smart-alec had pretty much run its course after ""Black Sheep"".  This character was the best 180 degree turn he could have made, because while he was a bit annoying at times, you didn't want to punch him in the head.

Brittany Daniel?  Awesome.
Jaime Pressley?  A bit creepy, but hilarious.
Christopher Walken?  Very creepy, but funny.
Kid Rock?  Biggest surprise of the movie.

You don't watch a movie whose cover is a mullet-loving dude with a mop and expect cinematic excellence, but if you want to turn your brain off, get a few surprises and a lot of laughs, this will fit the bill.",1398211200,,836,4.587837837837838

I am a big fan of Dennis.  This movie highlights the finer points of redneck living in a light hearted humorous manner.  Kid Rock is in it...you can tell it is NOT a far reach for him to display the white trash side of life, complete with early '80's Trans Am!!

1625284,4,B00005MEV2,"David Spade is one of those actors who I find genuinely hysterical.  There is just something about his shtick that really makes me chuckle, a lot.  Even when his films are ridiculously stupid, I can't help but feel that he elevates them to this other level of entertaining.  That same rationale can be applied to `Joe Dirt', a film that really has no grounds to stake a claim at `funny' and yet, it really is.  It is as predictable and manipulative as these `dumb comedies' come and yet, there is always Spade to make it all go down smoother.  Spade plays Joe Dirt, a hillbilly simpleton in search of his parents.  Being abandoned at the Grand Canyon in his youth weighed heavy on him, and so Joe recalls his adventures in a way that should make us walk away, but it doesn't.  YES, this film could have been much better, but much better is not what you expect when David Spade dons a mullet and pronounces his name `Dear-tay'.  What you expect is a shamelessly predictable gross-out comedy that will make you laugh out loud.  In that respect, `Joe Dirt' works.  Oh yeah, and that 'Silence of the Lambs' spoof is funnier than anything pulled out of 'Scary Movie'; or at least nearly so!",1304035200,,1185,4.4953271028037385

This movie is not made in spirit of ""Me, Myself, and Irene;"" ""Tommy Boy;"" or ""Dumb and Dumber."" Those movies were actually funny. Joe Dirt is the kind of movie that lets Hollywood know they can spend minimal time, money, and effort, and still make a fortune of a group of uniformed people who can't believe that a movie could be this bad, so they spend money and try to watch it anyway.

The script is horrible. The story horrible. The acting horrible. The attempts at comedy are rare and not even laughable.

If you try to watch this steaming pile of cr@p, you will be bored, not amused, and that will make you mad, which will make you kick your dog.  Please, you owe it your dog, don't watch this movie.

1625296,4,B00005MEV2,"# 123. Quite entertaining 2001 comedy that finds janitor / low-life / redneck wanna-be Joe Dirt (David Spade) in search of his long lost family that he hasn't seen since he was eight years old. Radio host Zander Kelly (Dennis Miller) takes a special interest in Dirt's story - as he tells it on 'air' over the course of several days. Dirt's gal pal, the sexy country girl of a small community Silvertown, Brandy (Brittany Daniel) seems to find that 'something appealing' about this society reject. Upside is that Joe Dirt turns out to be a geniune nice guy, yet many still think low and laugh at him.

David Spade is very entertaining as ""Joe Dirt,"" a down-and-out nice guy (but not exactly pure, either) who tells his tale of trying to find his parents to sleazy disc jockey ""Zander Kelly"" (Dennis Miller). Brittany Daniel is an attractive, likable female lead.

It's a fast-moving hour-and-a-half. Some of the scenes are outrageous, such as a dog getting his - can I say this? - testicles stuck to the porch. Yes, it's good family fare!! Ha. Ha.

1625301,5,B00005MEV2,"Joe Dirt is the gut-bustingly funny tale of a character by the same name, payed by David Spade.  He's a complete loser working as a janitor when he gets spotted and highlighted by a radio host (Dennis Miller) named Xander Kelly.  The show gives us the privilege of hearing about Joe's life, and the hilarity ensues.

First and foremost, Joe is pathetic looking.  He has a surgically attached mullet, porkchop sideburns, and facial hair that looks like the results of bad inbreeding.  What's more, he is absolutely clueless about how stupid he looks.  He's so worthless, in fact, that his parents abandoned him at the Grand Canyon, and it's this abandonment that begins his amazing journey.

Soon enough, we come to see Joe Dirt as not so pathetic, and we begin to empathize with him.  He's just an honest guy, looking for his family and love, but just happens to look horrible.

There are far too many hilarious scenes to mention, but a few noteworthy ones are when he meets an Indian named Kicking Wing who owns a fireworks stand in the desert.  In a matter of no time, the two are shooting fireworks into fuel, and causing massive explosions.  The next thing you know, Joe Dirt is getting septic tanks dumped on his head, dog's ballls are getting frozen to winter porches, and beatdowns occur at oil derricks.  All the while Joe is completely oblivious, spouting off lines like, ""Life's a garden; dig it"".

If you like to laugh out loud, then this is the movie for you.  It's highly recommended.  The entire movie provides laughs, and there are great cameos by several stars, namely Christopher Walken, who are intertwined in ingenious scenarios, one more outrageous than the previous.

This stands for its own and is a really good comedy. You just need a common sence of humar to enjoy this movie.

The movie seems like a knock off of Forest Gump almost in the way the movie is diplayed. The story is told from a stereo type  redneck. His name is Joe Dirt. He tells his tale of his life to a radio DJ and at first the DJ takes it all as a joke.
Many people start to really like Joe's story and soon Joe's story is in full effect.

Joe's story takes off way back from the point of getting lost at the Grand Canyon. He meets some very odd people and the love of his life along the way. All he wants is to be reunited with his long alost family.

Audio wise it's really good. You get some rock songs to mix into the movie. The movie may seem corny, but alot of the comedies out today don't stack up to Joe Dirts status.

Joe Dirt's upbeat personality somehow gives the loser in me a reason to feel hope.

Yea, its only a movie....but movies like any presentation of ideas, can be powerful to inspire as well as destroy. This movie is a silly comedy on the surface, but there is an underlying current of inspiration and hope within it for those who relate to Joe Dirt's social and familial alienation. And, it can make you laugh if you can sit back and let go of pretentions and just have some unselfconcious childish fun ( the best kind of fun IMHO). The scenes at the carnival are the funniest parts to me. ""This ain't unicef!""

Joe Dirt is one of those tongue-in-cheek comedies. Just look at the cover before you watch it... it's obvious it's not going to be an Academy Award winning movie anytime soon.

But if you actually HAVE a real sense of humor and don't get offended at every little thing (as some people seem to) then enjoy it for what it is. A comedy that can make you laugh and entertain, as movies are intended to.

1625320,4,B00005MEV2,"Another reviewer stated he couldn't understand why professional critics give ""films"" like ""Lost In Translation"" five stars, and mainstream comedies such as this two. The reason is quite simple: It boils down to the ""if you can't understand it, it must be deep"" maxim by which directors hawk erstwhile incomprehensible fare as somehow profound.

Actually, I rate ""Joe Dirt"" a bit higher than ""Lost in Translation,"" giving the latter three stars. I actually enjoyed Sofia Coppola's movie, but found the cinematography a bit wanting.

However, ""Joe Dirt"" has been slammed as a formulaic comedy. Indeed, that it is. However, the producers of this flick never make any intimations that this movie was anything other than what it was. Unlike ""American Beauty,"" a compilation of suburban cliches and stale anti-bourgeoise gripes, ""Joe Dirt"" doesn't pretend it's the latest profundity emanating from the Dalai Lama.

And, what it is is good fun, some gross gags and a somewhat autobiographical story for David Spade. It's about dirty Joe Dirt, an abandoned orphan now grown up and living in the broom closet of a classic rock radio station. He's discovered by shock jock Zander Kelly (played by the ever droll Dennis Miller), who exploits Joe's life story for the entertainment of his radio audience.

Like so many movies of its kind, it uses the road trip analogy borrowed by so many comedies ever since Homer's ""Odyssey."" Joe -- who was abandoned as a child at Grand Canyon  -- is searching for the parents who mislaid him so many year before. Along the way we meet tough guys that bully Joe (Joe Don Baker and Kid Rock), a real hot country gal (Brittany Daniel), an ex-mafioso hiding out as a janitor in a witness protection program (Christopher Walken, as suave as ever) and an American Indian shilling fireworks (Adam Beach).

""Joe Dirt"" has a good number of sight gags and lots of literal toilet humor, involving crap meteorites and a-bomb RV toilet tanks (""I got the poo on me!"" Joe cries, covered in dung). Walken has the movie's best line: ""It's your tone, it's all wrong. Do it again, and I'll stab you in the face with a soldering iron."") There's even a hilarious send-up of ""The Silence of the Lambs"" in which transvestite Buffalo Bob (Brian Thompson) imprisons Joe in a hole in the floor.

Best of all, Joe's life is set to a great soundtrack of classic rock songs from the late 1970s and early 80s by great bands such as Lynyrd Skynyrd, the Doobie Brothers, Bachman-Turner-Overdrive, April Wine, George Thorogood and the Destroyers and Cheap Trick.

No, ""Joe Dirt"" is not nearly as profound as ""Citizen Kane"" nor as funny as ""Young Frankenstein,"" but it's a solid film, and lots of fun, if you don't take a silly film as this seriously.",1102204800,6,2742,4.819148936170213

As the film progresses, Los Angeles(where the radio station is located) becomes captivated by the simpleton's plight and he becomes a local hero.
As with any film starring Spade, this movie has some very silly situations, but you can't help but laugh at them no matter how stupid they are.  This is one of those movies that falls under the category of ""guilty pleasure.""
One glaring omission from this film is Chris Farley, who, if alive, would have definitely been in this film.  Without Farley, however, Spade does a solid job and gives the viewer what to expect:  sophomoric comedy.
One note:  ""Dirt"" is from Louisiana, so was the ""Waterboy.""  This seemed to offend a lot of people from Louisiana because they felt that both films degraded people from the Pelican State.  I'm from Louisiana, and I wasn't offended in the least bit.  If anything, these films show the resiliency of the Bayou State's people and their ""never give up"" attitude, albeit in two rather buffoonish characters.  Just remember that these characters are so over the top, that you'd have to be an idiot to believe that everyone from Louisiana is so dim-witted.",1061769600,7,1652,4.881720430107527

Joe Dirt is a movie that profiles a pathetic country kid on a mission to find his long-lost parents.
This may sound like a cheesy plot, and if I'm honest, it is. But there are some funny jokes, and you have to laugh at Dennis Miller, who plays a stuck up DJ on an LA radio station, as he judges and critises Dirt about the sorry life he leads.
The shining lights in this film are David Spade, who plays Joe, and Clem, the janitor/ex-mobster, who he ends up working with. Spade is very funny, and if you like him as Finch in Just Shoot Me, then Joe Dirt is worth a look.
Perhaps the best part of the DVD is David Spade's audio commentary. In this he talks of the amount of times he had to beg producers to keep scenes in, and how he loves when someone says this or does that. His witty one-liners and unique laugh only help improve this film.
Watch the movie, then listen to Spade's commentary, and the short but entertaining blooper reel, and after all this decide whether or not Joe Dirt is a good movie or not.
Don't buy this DVD if you are after the best comedy ever, or an original and quality plot, but if you want some quick laughs and aren't too quick to pass judgement, then Joe Dirt might be right for you.",1055030400,,1428,4.103571428571429

1625396,4,B00005MEV2,"JOE DIRT is often crude, is rather poorly edited, yet is somewhat enjoyable. David Spade plays Joe Dirt, a white trailer trash kid who was separated from his parents on a trip to the Grand Canyon. Left on his own, Joe begins a life of nomadic existence before being forced into foster care. Later, he runs away beginning his wandering life again in a quest to find his parents. He travels all around the country, working at a host of jobs from carnie worker, alligator wrangler, walking tooth, oil worker, and a janitor to name just a few. Eventually, Joe ends up in L.A. and his story is told on a misanthropic, sarcastic radio program and Joe becomes a national celebrity.

JOE DIRT is rather crude and risque several times. I mean, the movie tries to make a joke out of a dog having it's testicles frozen to the floor of a front porch. However, this is an Adam Sandler produced picture so that should be expected. David Spade is sometimes funny as Joe Dirt, but more often than not he's just pathetic. Spade is great when it comes to witty, sarcastic humor; but when left to physical or situational comedy, Spade isn't that funny. The movie jumps around a lot and would have probably worked better if a lot of the radio station stuff (and Dennis Miller) was cut out and had the story told in a more coherent chronological order without the choppiness. Nevertheless, the film does have it's moments and is surprisingly funny.

Joe Dirt is an adventure that takes our mullet haired, skynyrd listening, AC/DC T-Shirt wearing friend on a quest to find the parents who deserted him 10 years ago.  The series and sequence of events of the film are a collage of thrown together vignettes that simply just don't work, on ANY level.

There are some moderately big stars in Joe Dirt like Christopher Walken, Dennis Miller, and Rosanna Arquette; all I can say is that they must have owed Spade a favor.  David Spade is at his best when his dead-pan sarcasm is allowed to shine through.  In this film, Joe Dirt is not sarcastic rather Spade tries to pull him off as a lovable backwoods kid.

The deleted scenes were, for the most part, deleted for a reason. The outtakes and bloopers are very funny. The coup de grace is the ""David Spade Commentary"". Spade's commentary is funnier by far than the movie. Spade also explains why many of the jokes weren't as funny as they could have been: PG-13 rating requirements. All in all, if you saw the movie and liked it, I would recommend the DVD for its extra features.",998956800,4,933,4.461988304093567
1625436,5,B00005MEV2,"Why the fuss about mindless humor?  Exactly what is wrong  with that?  There are plenty of us who after a long stressful day want to sit in an air conditioned movie theater and be mindlessly entertained with stuff we really don't have to think about.  Joe Dirt gives this type of entertainment.  Don't get me wrong, I have nothing against movies that one has to be sharp minded to ""get"", but once in a while it's nice not to have to think so much.  I would recommend Joe Dirt to anyone who is seeking that kind of entertainment.  Incidentally, I usually hate David Spade, but I could barely tell that was him underneath the mullet.  I can't wait to get it on DVD.",998524800,19,663,4.333333333333333
1625437,1,B00005MEV2,This is one of David Spades worst films ever. They have a cameo of the white trash king Kid Rock who only adds the the poor acting and horrible cliches. There are maybe two or three funny scenes that can lead only the biggest fans of David Spade to chuckle. If you have nothing better to do and would like to see just how low David Spade can really go then pick this one up.,996364800,9,374,4.0

1625459,4,B00005MEV2,"Former 'Saturday Night Live' comedian David Spade is JOE DIRT, a radio station janitor with a mullet haircut. One day, Joe is asked to appear as a guest on a radio talk show hosted by Xander Kelly, and Joe tells of his life-long quest to find his parents who abandoned him at the Grand Canyon when he was only 8 years old. Soon, everybody all over the nation is tuning into the radio station to hear the adventures of Joe Dirt and the many people that he has met along the way. I have to say this movie was definitly better than I expected, and I think David Spade is an underrated actor --- people don't give him the credit that I think he deserves. Well, this movie had me laughing out loud from start to a semi-sentimental finish. Long live Joe Dirt!",993081600,,753,4.2727272727272725
1625460,4,B00005MEV2,"The Story of Joe Dirt is a Story that Deserves to be told, it's Funny, Uplifting and... Nice, which was a Change from the Vile, Mean, Gross out comedy I went in Expecting (and of course... Wanted to see). Sure, it has moments of Ingenious Gross out comedy, but At it's Core, and for most of it's Running time, it has a lot of Heart. David Spade's Leap to Big Screen Leading man is a Successful one, like the films producer Adam Sandler, and their Mutual Friend Rob Schneider, Spade is the Underdog with a Heart of Gold and I for one couldn't Wait to see him come out On Top.
Spade is (you guessed it) Joe Dirt, a Mullet-wearing Loser whose life has been Fraught with Failure and Overcome by Opposition, well Not Quite overcome, as Dirt is an Undying Optimist. He is brought onto a Radio show one day by a Satirical DJ (Dennis Miller) to be the Butt of all the Jokes, but as his story unfolds, the DJ, the Listeners, the Entire Country get caught up in his story and he becomes a National Hero.
The film is Always Amusing, Sometimes Hysterical one. It features a Wonderful Supporting cast that, no matter How much screen time they get, they Give they're all. Dennis Miller is Naturally a Hilarious man, he is also one of the most Underrated comedians in America, I just Love the guy, he can do no wrong. Brittany Daniels is Sugary Sweet and Boundlessly Beautiful as Joe's Sweetheart. Jaime Pressly is Endlessly Sexy and Fiendishly Funny as a Strange Acquaintance of Joe's. Brittany and Jaime are both Unbelievable Beautiful actresses and they also prove themselves to be Quite Talented Comediennes.
Christopher Walken gives a cameo that threatens to Steal the film out from under Joe's feet, he is a Brilliant performer and I Await the day when he takes on a Full-Blown Lead role in a Comedy. It could Happen, don't Poo-poo the idea straight away, just think about it. Rosanna Arquette gives an Amusing performance as well, the one performance in the film that Stands out as Genuinely Bad is Kid Rock's performance. This man is Not an Actor, he is bad, there is no other way of putting it. He looks Very uncomfortable in front of the camera when he is Supposed to be playing a Bully Character. ""Joe Dirt"" features a Lot of other known faces and Good performances, but to list them all would Bore you and Annoy me, but I will anyway. Fred Ward, Adam Beach and Joe Don Baker. That wasn't so bad.
Overall, it is a Pleasing ""Forest Gump""-ish tale of Overcoming Adversity, Accepting Yourself and your Situation and making the audience laugh. I went in thinking it would be a Silly Gross out comedy and I came out Shocked because I'd just seen a Good Film, with a Good Story. Man, I didn't see that coming at all.
Oh, one last thing. When Joe heads to Florida, keep a eye out for a certain funny man from ""The Waterboy"".",992736000,14,2813,4.474708171206226
1625461,2,B00005MEV2,"Joe Dirt is a black comedy. Not as black as you can get, but dark. I don't have a problem with that, in fact, I love black comedies. But only when they can build up to the laughter, when it actually means something. This is not the case in Joe Dirt, the comedy - which is at times hilarious, at others laughably unfunny - is just quick snippits and then back to the story that has David Spade looking for his parents. That is not entirely bad, but the story falls flat later on in the movie because it has no more supporting material. Other than that, the performances aren't that impressive; yeah, their not supposed to be because it's the enjoyment and the comedy that matters, but it would be nice to see some great performances reminiscent of maybe Peter Sellers in a modern movie. The film is also very unrealistic. But, this movie has a cool hair-do and some original characters, which make it bearable enough to sit through. But, sometimes you just wonder why all the people around you are laughing at such typical jokes. I would most highly recommend Joe Dirt to a teenage audience, they'll get hyped up about the `coolness' and enjoy talking about it on the ride home.",990835200,,1177,4.47906976744186

1625464,1,B00005MEV2,"Joe Dirt is an udderly boring comedy about some moron, who was ditched by his parents at eight. David Spade suprisingly did a nice job, but the plot was horrible. Between the perverted comments and retarded jokes, Joe Dirt scores lower than dirt on my recommendations. I truly feel sorry for David Spade because this will completely ruin his image.  A radio talk-show host gets Joe to spill his life's sad story over the radio. Joe starts off by him being ditched at the Gran Canyon when he was eight. The movie continues as Joe runs into: A copy of Hannibal Lecter, a country girl named Brandy, a witness relocatee (gets him in big trouble), an Indian dude, and a large collection of other completely strange things. Joe Dirt is a complete waste of time and should not be considered a choice when selecting a movie to go see.",989020800,8,826,4.543624161073826
