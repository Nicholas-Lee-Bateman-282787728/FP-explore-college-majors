3466718,5,B001ASJIXG,"The movie itself is like any typical Hallmark movie, so I don't get why people were expecting something absolutely stunning. It was a good movie, with a simple enough concept to follow that you don't have to think about when you watch it. Sometimes it's good to watch something and not have to think too hard through mysteries and plot twists and all that. I will admit that the script was a bit lacking, making the movie feel a little dragging and dry. However, I found the movie as a whole something nice that made me laugh. And of course, I'm a huge Shannen Doherty fan, so that's a huge plus.",1458432000,,596,4.378378378378378

Shannen Doherty is still acting, though I haven't seen much of her in the past five years.
This is my most-recent Christmas movie purchase. I buy about fifteen every year.
My wife liked this more than I do, but she likes THE REF more than I do, too.

3466791,5,B001ASJIXG,This is a combination of two other movies - Uncle Buck which in a way its a Christmas version of and How the grinch stole Christmas - and its a very funny and very good movie. A jewel thief finds herself looking after her niece and nephew just before Christmas after a jewel heist goes wrong. Im sorry for a small spoiler here but I find it ironic that her true love is the sherriff. Anyway you should see this movie. Merry Christmas.,1359158400,,434,4.240963855421687

3466797,4,B001ASJIXG,"I'm a sucker for a good christmas flick. I have made it a tradition to buy a couple of these every christmas season just to get in the festive mode. I have not always been impressed by Shannen Doherty's acting skills but I gotta admit that in this one she's pretty good. Although ""Christmas Caper"" follows the traditional format of sceptic turned into true believer there is a charm to this 2007 flick that put a smile on my face. The supporting cast is so good, especially the character Annie, that you tend to forget all the cheesiness that follows with this kind of movies. If you don't like the overly commercialisation of the holiday then remember that it is all about love for one another and togetherness that matters. as shown in Kate's total turnaround from hardcore thief into lovingly accepting her family and letting love into her life.

3466809,3,B001ASJIXG,"I borrowed it from the library, thinking I might want to buy it.  I like films that teach, so I thought the premise might be interesting.  I wanted a GOOD script, a solid connection between characters (I try to overlook a mediocre script if the acting is good enough - it wasn't) and this film just didn't have enough sparkle or holiday charm. So I give it two and a half stars because it was okay to see once - alone.",1309564800,,418,4.148148148148148

3466811,2,B001ASJIXG,"I removed my initial review thinking it to be too harsh.  But seeing this thing all the way through I can't help but say that this is one of the most vapid, sugary, house-wife oriented films ever produced for the small screen.

A ""former"" jewel thief with the motherly instincts of a model PTA member?  Give me a break.  She lacks any kind of street savvy other than to talk to a couple of uninspired actors who are allegedly jewel thieves, one being a fence.

The acting is abysmal on all levels.  It's a supposed to be a Christmas film, se we can give it a little wiggle room for having to placate to a niche market; the house mom, but beyond that this thing isn't worth the celluloid that it was filmed on.

This house mom is allegedly ""on the lam"" after doing ""a job"", but there's nothing in the sense of desperation, nothing in terms of anything other than an opening sequence where she acts like a cavalier Soccer Mom.  She even removes her mask and veil to let down her long flowing brown hair so that we know who it is tinkering with the high tech burglary equipment.

The opening sequence is lack luster, and much of the film is static talking bodies.  It's a made for TV film, so there's budgetary constraints, but B-films have more story meat than this junk.  No movement, no action in terms of characterization, absolutely nothing beyond the actresses talking to one another, with the occasional male popping in.

Suddenly I regret removing my initial review, but, in defense of the target audience, I'll say this; if you're a house mom with some criminal fantasy but are completely out of touch with how the real world of thieves operates, than this film is for you.  And that was the original intent in the first place.

Otherwise pass it up, or donate the disk to the library.

This is truly a waste of time.",1298678400,,1823,4.448795180722891

Now she is responsible for watching her niece and nephew while her sister and husband are stranded on holiday.
She soon finds out that not only are people willing to accept her now but her own attitude years ago is what brought on much of her perceived rejection and all are willing to forgive and welcome her with open arms.
Now, it's up to her to decide if she will do the right thing and truly come home for the holidays.",1289520000,,659,4.28
