2410017,5,B000BB1MQO,"Stalking Laura is a great TV movie from the early 90s. The movie stars two 70s icons; model/actress Brooke Shields and TV actor Richard Thomas best known as John Boy Walton. Shields plays Laura Black a beautiful young engineer who has come to the Silicon Valley to work for a top company called KEI. She is met there by her supervisor Chris and Richard Farley (played by Richard Thomas) a fellow engineer the trio head for a work lunch. Farley is immediately smitten with Black and asks her out at lunch. She refuses however he continues pursuing and asking her out until he becomes a stalker. Thomas is effective in the role of creepy obsessed villain. Shields hold up her part surprisingly well. This movie is good for repeated viewings due to the professional acting, photography and pacing. The movie is mostly accurate to the real life story save for a few details like for example the real Farley was much older and uglier than Thomas he was also not an engineer but a technician. He is actually still on deathrow in California! Still this movie is effective it's a warning to women and companies for what to look for in these types of situations. It's also a warning to men that NO means NO.",1406592000,,1198,4.576744186046511
2410018,5,B000BB1MQO,I love true story movies and this is one of the best! What Laura went through is the reason there are laws against stalking in this country. I highly recommend this DVD for the pure purpose of exposing how twisted a stalker can be and to what extremes he is willing to go in order to get the victims attention!,1404345600,2,310,4.183333333333334

2410036,2,B000BB1MQO,Have been hunting for this movie for a long time and was happy to see it in stock. The DVD quality was terrible.

I'm not a fan of Brooke Shields...but Richard Thomas is worth the price of the DVD. And it is based on a true story.  Thank you",1320364800,,409,3.951219512195122
2410038,5,B000BB1MQO,"""Stalking Laura"" is a made-for-TV film based on a true story.  I was instantly drawn into the unforgettable plot.

Laura, (Brook Shields), is an engineer who finds a job at a prestigious company.  She is introduced to one of her coworkers, Richard Farley, (Richard Thomas), who is immediately infatuated.  Infatuation quickly turns to obsession, and when Laura rejects his advances, the brilliant and sadistic Richard vows revenge: not only against Laura, but against all those, according to his warped perceptions, who have mistreated him.  The resulting explosive climax will stay with you long after the movie is finished.  Laura's courage resulted in more stringent laws regarding the safety of women and men everywhere.

""Stalking Laura"" is a true drama that explores the borderline between love and obsession.  Brook Shields is totally convincing as the terrorized Laura, and Richard Thomas superbly shows his versatility as an actor by portraying Richard Farley so well.  Thomas is chilling in his performance.  His gentle, soothing tennor voice provides suaveness for a despicable psychopathic personality, and his brief flashes of rage put the viewer in mind of a coiled snake ready to strike.

Please give this outstanding film a chance.  Happy viewing, and God bless.",1270771200,,1278,5.335
2410039,4,B000BB1MQO,"Should have been the title for this movie. I was shocked and stunned to see Richard Thomas, everyone's favorite All-American guy, playing a psychotic man with obvious rejection, self-esteem, and erotomania issues. Richard Farley was a man who just did not, or would not, take no for an answer from Laura Black, played to perfection by the luminous and super-talented Brooke Shields. I did not know what to expect seeing Richard Thomas play this role. I had seen television and documentary coverage of Richard Farley and I did not know how he would bridge the gap between his image and the reality of the psychosis of Farley, but he does so brilliantly. Watching Thomas portraying Farley at first unassuming, then pushy, then moving on to breaking and entering after somehow getting in Laura's garage when she lived in a high-security gated community, and then his final descent into madness before beginning the attack on his former employer was shocking. You get a significant sense of Farley's evil and mental illness when you watch him break into Laura's office, rifle her trash and pretend to kiss the tissue upon which she blotted her lipstick, and then find the address book with her family and friends' names, addresses, and phone numbers. Do not watch this film thinking that you know Richard Thomas as an actor. Wait until the film is over before making that determination. He shows his dramatic range perfectly, and his point-perfect demonstration of Farley's obvious glee over his assault on Laura and all of his other former colleagues at their Silicon Valley workplace is chilling, to say the very least. This film is violent and sickening toward the end, so please use parental guidance if children under 17 will be watching this film. If drama and suspense based in reality is something you enjoy watching this film does not disappoint. It was initially a CBS movie of the week, but now all high school and college-aged girls should have to watch this movie to learn what to do, and what not to do, when a guy won't take no for an answer.",1265500800,2,2053,4.818696883852692
2410040,4,B000BB1MQO,"Richard Thomas is typically excellent, as the psycho-creep Richard Farley, who
tries to force the love of ambitious Laura Black, well played by Brooke Shields.
Note his first clumsy importunity, when he lurches across Laura to yank some
tickets out of the glove compartment of his BIG truck (inferiority complex?)
Farley's obsession builds to such outrageous offenses that you will yell for Laura,
when she can, to shoot him to ""swiss-cheese""dom.  You will also yell in frustration
at the supercilious HR exec who drags her feet to discipline the loathsome Rich.
""Engineers are often...eccentric,"" she explains to the exasperated Laura.

  Also outstanding is Richard Yniguez as a true hero, the hostage negotiator
detective who uses clever psychology on a murdering maniac, wearing him down
with soothing promises of a quart Diet-Coke ""with lots of ice"" and a Togo's #26.
(""It's the BEST!"") The assault on the company HQ will have you jumping with
each resounding shotgun blast! To sum, here's a modestly-produced TV thriller
I can watch repeatedly, for the crazed Thomas, stunning Shields, and persuasive
Yniguez!",1257897600,,1115,5.2824858757062145
2410041,4,B000BB1MQO,"First of all, forget about John-Boy.  Richard Thomas has proven he can play every character type that spans the entire spectrum between both extremes, from John-Boy to Rich Farley.  Brooke Sheilds looks a lot like the real Laura Black, and it's a good supporting cast also.  The plot is a good one, and it's a movie that's not only entertaining, but also serves as a portrayal of the realities of those with an obsession.  Overall, it's a great movie, but dont' let the kids watch!",1250208000,2,481,4.623529411764705
2410042,5,B000BB1MQO,"I was employed at the same company, ESL, and worked in the same building, M5, as Laura Black.  Fortunately for me, I quit the company the day before the shootings took place.  Although I worked in the same building and on the same floor, I was not in the same group as Laura.  Although I do remember her - she was an attractive young woman.

From all that I know about the actual event the movie is, for the most part, very accurate in both the overall story and also in the details.  It seemed particularly accurate in many of the particulars:  Farley shooting his first victim at the entrance to the building, Farley shooting many computer terminals, the Togo's #26, Laura being on the 2nd story of a two story building, the restraining order, and many more details.

But there is one area where the movie does not follow what really happened.  In the movie Richard Farley is portrayed as a valuable engineer with reasonable physical attractiveness.  In reality, Farley was a technician (not a college graduate position), was substantially older than Black, and was not very attractive physically - you can see his picture on Wikipedia.  It is not clear to me why the people who made this movie made this change to the story.  My best guess is that it allowed the development of the scenes where the HR person at KEI (ESL) implied that Laura shared some of the blame for Farley's advances.  In reality it would have been very hard to believe that Laura shared any blame for the situation.  Because of this deviation from reality, I am more skeptical that scenes with HR are accurate (of course I don't know the truth here).  Also, Laura went back to ESL after she recovered and worked there for years.  This indicates that she did not have animosity towards the company which implies that HR did not behave as portrayed in the movie.

Despite these changes which appear to be made to build the drama, I think the movie was a very good portrayal of a very unfortunate event.",1240704000,28,1975,4.568181818181818
2410043,5,B000BB1MQO,"Richard Thomas was at his best in this movie. Forget John-Boy! Thomas was absolutely chilling in his portrayal of a crazed stalker, and eventually, killer. Sadly, incidents such as what happened in this true story have since happened far too frequently, including one just yesterday. Nevertheless, this movie gives you valuable insight into the mind of the type of troubled and deranged person who would do something of this magnitude. Despite the violence, this is a 5 star movie.",1238803200,8,481,5.10126582278481
2410044,5,B000BB1MQO,"I first saw this several years ago when I was just a child.  It had such an impact on me that I recently searched the TV channels until I finally located it and watched it again.  I told my sister about it and she said that we should definitely buy a copy of it.

Although I watched it as a child, I don't believe it is a good movie for children as the end of the movie gets kind of bloody and frightening.  Parents should decide for themselves if their children can handle it.",1223424000,,477,4.042553191489362
2410045,5,B000BB1MQO,This movie delivers all of the suspense and thrills of a true tale of obsession.  The cast was selected with perfection.  I would highly recommend the movie.,1220745600,,157,4.777777777777778
2410046,5,B000BB1MQO,Richard Thomas and Brooke Shields are terrific in this movie. A movie anyone can relate to.,1216512000,2,91,4.75
2410047,4,B000BB1MQO,"I found this little gem after a lot of searching on various sites. Having seen it 14 years ago when it appeared on TV under the title of 'I Can Make You Love Me; The Stalking of Laura Black', and being haunted by how accurate it was, I was thrilled to see it again. Richard Thomas brilliantly plays the computer engineer Richard Farley (though he looks nothing like the real Richard Farley); cunning, fiendish and genuinely chilling. For those who remember Thomas as 'John-Boy' on 'The Waltons', his performance will shatter that wholesome image. Brooke Shields is quite effective as Laura Black, the new computer engineer working at Farley's firm who fights back against his relentless harassment. The actors who play Chris (her supervisor at KEI) and Lt. Grijalva (hostage negotiator) are also effective. Having read about the true story of Farley & Black, I can say with some confidence that the movie is extremely close to the facts of the true story. Richard Farley finds out EVERY detail of Laura's life, right down to the locations of her parents & sisters, then threatens to harm them should Laura continue to ignore him. Farley is eventually fired by KEI for his continual harassment & decrease in productivity. But even THAT does not stop him - he continues his chilling pursuit of Laura by showing up in her garage, at her work, following her when she is dating another man, and, most chillingly - returns for a final time to KEI to carry out a horrifying massacre. It will end with 7 KEI employees dead, SWATs called in to stop the assault, and Farley awaiting a death sentence at San Quentin. Probably one of the finest TV movies ever produced in the 1990s.",1210377600,13,1670,4.722602739726027
2410048,5,B000BB1MQO,"""Stalking Laura"" is the feel good romantic comedy of the year that's finally available on DVD. Richard Thomas stars as our shy, misunderstood hero Richard Farley who's determined to win the heart of a cold, career minded co-worker (Laura Black) portrayed with bitchy hilariousness by Brooke Shields. Determined to win her love despite the objections of an overzealous and litigious HR representative, clueless bosses and Laura's wacky best friend, who all try their best to prevent the unlikely interoffice romance, a cute office game of ""Cowboys and Indians"" shows just how far Richard will go to win Laura's cold heart.

I can't think of a better way to spend a chilly Tuesday night, than to curl up on my sofa with a Togo's #23 sandwich (it's the best) and a quart sized diet cola (extra ice, I like to chew on the ice) and my copy of ""Stalking Laura"". If I could give this movie 7-stars, I would, but take my word for it. I will make you love Stalking Laura.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Richard Farley: I want her to live. She can't regret it if she doesn't live.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Penny: Do you understand that sexual harassment is against the law? You could be fired!
Richard Farley: If I lost my job, I'd have nothing to live for.
Penny: That's my point. We want you to stay.
Richard Farley: I have guns. I'd kill myself. I wouldn't be the only one; others would go.
Penny: Rich, are you saying if you were fired, you would kill me?
Richard Farley: Yes. Not just you, I'd take others as well.
[Long silence]
Richard Farley: Excuse me.
[Farley gets up and leaves]

Lawrence Kane: [Mr. Kane spots Richard heading for the building as he is leaving work. Richard is carrying a rifle, 2 shotguns, a series of pistols and more than 200 rounds of ammunition] Whoa!
[turns around as he walks past Farley]
Richard Farley: [turns to face Kane] Hey Larry - Cowboys and Indians!
[Farley fires his shotgun at Kane, then blows out the building's front doors and enters]

Penny: It would be best if you didn't attend the aerobics classes. He might get wrong idea.
Laura Black: What?
Penny: The clothes?

the guy Richard Thomas played was a real nut!",1203206400,2,93,4.875
2410050,4,B000BB1MQO,"Laura Black (Brooke Shields) just graduated from UC Davis and got a primo job working for a defense contractor in the Silicon Valley. She unwittingly captures the attention of a fellow worker, Richard Farley (played chillingly by Richard ""John Boy"" Thomas), who becomes fixated on her to the point of obsession. After finally spurning his attentions, reporting him to HR, and filing a restraining order, Richard gets a slap on the wrist, manages to land another IT job at a competing company (since HR did not want to hurt his employment opportunities), then returns to the office armed to the hilt to seek vengeance against the woman who dared to not return his affections. Going on a shooting rampage that took a company hostage and left many dead in his wake, Thomas is the epitome of a cold and calculating killer. You won't look at John Boy Walton in the same way after viewing this. Or the Togo's #23 sandwich.

The story is all the more chilling since it is based on actual events which eventually led to California's stringent anti-stalking laws and a company's responsibility to its employees in creating a safe workplace.  IT was originally released as ""I Can Make You Love Me.""",1187654400,29,1188,4.790243902439024
2410051,4,B000BB1MQO,"Stalking Laura is a great movie if what you are after is one and a half hours of quality entertainment. Take in to account that Brooke Shields in the early 90's was never going to make an outstanding movie to begin with, the storyline stays close to the orginal happenings of Richard Farley and Richard Thomas provides a freakishly good account of his character. If what you after is a thriller that requires brain power and tests human knowledge, i probably wouldn't pick this movie. But for what it is - a great movie. I thoroughly enjoyed.",1175385600,6,542,4.597938144329897
2410052,5,B000BB1MQO,"This was a great movie. The true story of a woman that was stalked by a man she worked with. He was everywhere she went. She never even dated him. She told him from the beginning that they would only have a professional relationship but he ignored her. Eventually he was fired for his behavior. When the problems he caused were going to prevent her from getting a promotion she finally filed for a restraining order. That threw him over the edge. He armed himself as if he were going to war and went to work with one thing on his mind. Kill as many as he could.

Great movie. This event helped create Anti-Stalking laws in California.",1145923200,16,634,4.372881355932203

For example: chapter 1 as soon as the beginning credits are done, it automatically goes to chapter 3. (3) And then it switched back to chapter 2.

Word of advise. If any more people order this from New Star Video, don't. Try find this on another DVD company if possible. Sad thing about this is this movie is awesome.
