I usually never watch cartoons, and if I do it is usually the old fashion kind (Tom & Jerry, Pink Panther, Looney Tunes, etc.) but as I saw the box cover I thought to myself this is just too hilarious to pass up and indeed it is. A extremely quick funny sketches, this looney tunes version of the white house just about sums up the Bush years. It is politically one sided most definitely, but it delivers the laughs and it hit the target w lil bush. I just could not stop laughing. All the folks who have trashed this tiny toon, we know what side they are on and it would make total sense to trash it for they won't find the humor in it much less figure out all the inuendo its filled with. Lots and lots of subtle as well as in your face commentaries. Does this accomplish its purpose? without a doubt. Its way funnier than The Simpsons and for my personal taste, it refreshingly vulgar with lots of adult humor.

George is in elementary school -- along with classmates (his future cabinet members and executive staff). The characters resemble their adult selves in personality and behaviors and the episodes are very loosely based on some factual tidbit recognizable to most. This series is not partisan nearly as much as it is satire. For better or worse, President G. W. Bush provided the creators of Lil' Bush with rich data to draw from. If you still have questions about this very well priced DVD -- take a good close look at the cover and know that Barb and George Sr. are in the big white house simply trying to raise their sons right.

3048073,5,B001053074,"Regardless of how you feel regarding the politics in america, this a show that is just political satire at it's best.  Not in recent years have I laughed so hard & so much at a cartoon.  Unlike South Park & Family Guy which has a record of having ""hit & miss"" episodes, so far the first season of Lil' Bush hasn't missed one.  Don't get the wrong idea, just because the show is called Lil' Bush & his cabinet/family are the stars of the show...EVERYONE gets made fun of from Bill & Hillary to Obama & Michael Moore...and even celebrity media news stories get a quick one liner like Paris Hilton's jail time & Bob Barker's retirement.  If your highly sensitive then avoid this but if you have an open sense of humor then pick this up & be prepared to just have a big laugh at people & situations that have caused a heavy amount of mixed reactions & strong emotions from americans & others around the world over the past 8 years.",1216512000,3,927,4.310344827586207

3048078,4,B001053074,"I bought this DVD set on a whim never seeing a single episode on Comedy Central and, though it isn't as funny and doesn't have the re-watch ability of South Park and Family Guy, there is enough about this season to like and to hold my interest for future seasons. The cartoon is about George W Bush as a kid (he is sooo cute!) living in the White House during his father's administration (there is much creative license when it comes to the ages of these characters). His brother Jeb is there, too (and he is a freakin' moron--but Lil' George has to be nice to him because he may help him rig an election some day). Barney is the family dog (shouldn't their dog be Millie?). Lil' George has four friends who follow him around and do whatever he says. Lil' Rummy is the smart one who always talks about being beaten by his father. Lil' Cheney is the brutal henchman who says mostly ""rowr, r-rowr, rowr"" but then can throw in an actual word or two that can be very funny. Lil' Condi is the skinny girl who wishes she could catch the eye of Lil' George only he has a thing for chubby Lil' Laura (Lil' Laura has a very small role, I don't remember her even speaking a line). Condi is the only one of the group who seems to have a moral conscience, though she never gets to use it. The Lil' Democrats are there, too.

In the bonus material, the creators point out that it's not strictly an anti-Bush show and that The Lil' Democrats aren't shown in too good of light either (well, Lil' Barack Obama remains unscathed save for a smoking scene), but let's face it: it is definitely an anti-Republican show. My political leanings tend to be Republican but I still find humor in seeing how far Bush haters will go. Though light-hearted at times, the show paints the Bush team as heartless and self-centered to an almost inhumane degree. The parts that go way over-the-top, strangely enough, involve Barbara Bush! What did she ever do to deserve such nastiness??

Lil' George and his cronies are in a band and there are a lot of songs in these episodes. Some of them are pretty funny lyrically and catchy musically although I'm not a big fan of musical numbers in animated shows (including Family Guy) as I think they take away from more jokes, but I find myself humming some of these songs (especially, the ""Special Buddy"" song for Lil' George and Lil' Tony Blair), so I guess they're OK, but less is best where the music is concerned. Here are the episodes:

Iraq/First Kiss--Opening message: Paris Hilton. Lil' Bush sees stories about Iraq on news channels other than Fox that does not put his father's administration in a good light. For Father's Day, Lil' George goes against his inclination not to serve and finds his way into joining the military and going to Iraq in search of a ""feel-good type story"" for his dad. The ending is pretty funny. In the second segment, Lil' George and his cronies have a bet as to who gets their first kiss first. George has his sights set on Lil' Laura, and Lil' Cheney on George's mom! Lil' Bill and Hillary make an appearance (along with the Lil' Lewinski twins). Lil' Condi may end up winning the bet--but not the way she hoped.

Nuked/Camp--Opening message: Bob Barker. A foreign exchange student humiliates Lil' George and he wants revenge. Fortunately, it's 'Take Your Kid to Work Day' (Lil' Jeb goes to work with Barney to teach him how to drink out of the toilet) and Lil' George has access to weapons of mass revenge. Next, the gang go to Lil' Camp David. They find their way to Al Qaeda Camp and play pranks on them. The Jeb sidebar stuff was a bore but the arm-chewing bit was hilarious. The Lil' Bush band dress like KISS for the talent show. The ending to this one is rather weak.

Gay Friend/Mexican--Opening message: immigration. It's football tryouts, but Lil' George isn't cut out for the sport. He meets up with an agreeable, jolly English kid, Lil' Tony Blair, and they decide to be cheerleaders. Lil' George's parents are alarmed by this new friend who ""drives on the wrong side of the road."" With Lil' George preoccupied, his posse find someone else to follow around: Lil' Barack Obama. In the next segment, Lil' George doesn't like doing chores so he hires a Mexican to do his work for him (""Mexicans, they're America's greatest resource""). This episode is one of my favorites.

Global Warming/Hall Monitor--Lil' Al Gore tries to convince Lil' George and the gang that global warming will ruin the planet by taking them in a time machine to New York City 100 years in the future. Lil' George and the gang keep wanting to go back to free ice cream day (""we were so innocent then""). Highlight: Al Gore explains how he really did invent the Internet! The Lil' Bush band does a Red Hot Chili Peppers type song for Lil' Earth Day. This is my favorite segment of Lil' Bush so far. Next, Lil' George becomes Hall Monitor but his authority is challenged by Lil' John McCain. Lil' George gets advice from his Hippie brother Neil (he's George's older brother here--in real life he is 9 years younger) and uses fear to shut up McCain's ""straight talk."" Highlight: George Bush Sr. is allergic to Asians.

Evolution/Press Corps Dinner--Lil' George has problems learning evolution, especially when the kid he's cheating off of, Lil' Cheney of all people, dies of a heart attack (Don't worry, Lil' Cheney proved to be too much for Hell so he was sent back). He learns at the St. Nogaysallowedius Church that he doesn't need to learn...anything. Next, a George Bush impersonator hired to be the opening act at the Press Corps Dinner starts to invade the Bush's privacy. Lil' George feels ""nepotastic"" about being the headliner at the dinner, but he gets jokes from the Lil' Democrats.

Haunted House/Hot Dog--The Lil' Democrats play a joke on Lil' George and the gang by challenging them to spend the night in the haunted attic in the White House. Next segment, Lil' George is angry that Hot Dog Day at the school was canceled to make way for a multi-cultural lunch menu. To save Hot Dog Day, Lil' George and the gang resort to some heavy-handed methods that were filmed by documentary film maker Lil' Michael Moore.

Walter Reed-A bonus episode made in case the real VP Dick Cheney died which would make ""Evolution"" highly inappropriate (that geeky-looking guy in the preamble sure hates the VP!). Lil' Bush does not want to participate in Operation Cuddlestorm (where kids go to the front lines to hug troops) so he instead films an AC/DC style music video at the Walter Reed hospital. An unintended result is that their video shows how poor the conditions are at the hospital. As usual, though, things have a way of working out for the Bushes. Henry Rollins contributes his voice to Steve ""halfsy"" the wounded soldier who lost his left hand and leg in the war. The character looks like Rollins, too.  This is the most heavy-handed anti-Republican episode of this season.",1207612800,5,6908,4.613506916192026

I usually never watch cartoons, and if I do it is usually the old fashion kind (Tom & Jerry, Pink Panther, Looney Tunes, etc.) but as I saw the box cover I thought to myself this is just too hilarious to pass up and indeed it is. A extremely quick funny sketches, this looney tunes version of the white house just about sums up the Bush years. It is politically one sided most definitely, but it delivers the laughs and it hit the target w lil bush. I just could not stop laughing. All the folks who have trashed this tiny toon, we know what side they are on and it would make total sense to trash it for they won't find the humor in it much less figure out all the inuendo its filled with. Lots and lots of subtle as well as in your face commentaries. Does this accomplish its purpose? without a doubt. Its way funnier than The Simpsons and for my personal taste, it refreshingly vulgar with lots of adult humor.

George is in elementary school -- along with classmates (his future cabinet members and executive staff). The characters resemble their adult selves in personality and behaviors and the episodes are very loosely based on some factual tidbit recognizable to most. This series is not partisan nearly as much as it is satire. For better or worse, President G. W. Bush provided the creators of Lil' Bush with rich data to draw from.

Not in recent years have I laughed so hard & so much at a cartoon.  Unlike South Park & Family Guy which has a record of having ""hit & miss"" episodes, so far the first season of Lil' Bush hasn't missed one.  Don't get the wrong idea, just because the show is called Lil' Bush & his cabinet/family are the stars of the show...EVERYONE gets made fun of from Bill & Hillary to Obama & Michael Moore...and even celebrity media news stories get a quick one liner like Paris Hilton's jail time & Bob Barker's retirement.  If your highly sensitive then avoid this but if you have an open sense of humor then pick this up & be prepared to just have a big laugh at people & situations that have caused a heavy amount of mixed reactions & strong emotions from americans & others around the world over the past 8 years.",1216512000,3,927,4.310344827586207

3282575,4,B001053074,"I bought this DVD set on a whim never seeing a single episode on Comedy Central and, though it isn't as funny and doesn't have the re-watch ability of South Park and Family Guy, there is enough about this season to like and to hold my interest for future seasons. The cartoon is about George W Bush as a kid (he is sooo cute!) living in the White House during his father's administration (there is much creative license when it comes to the ages of these characters). His brother Jeb is there, too (and he is a freakin' moron--but Lil' George has to be nice to him because he may help him rig an election some day). Barney is the family dog (shouldn't their dog be Millie?). Lil' George has four friends who follow him around and do whatever he says. Lil' Rummy is the smart one who always talks about being beaten by his father. Lil' Cheney is the brutal henchman who says mostly ""rowr, r-rowr, rowr"" but then can throw in an actual word or two that can be very funny. Lil' Condi is the skinny girl who wishes she could catch the eye of Lil' George only he has a thing for chubby Lil' Laura (Lil' Laura has a very small role, I don't remember her even speaking a line). Condi is the only one of the group who seems to have a moral conscience, though she never gets to use it. The Lil' Democrats are there, too.

In the bonus material, the creators point out that it's not strictly an anti-Bush show and that The Lil' Democrats aren't shown in too good of light either (well, Lil' Barack Obama remains unscathed save for a smoking scene), but let's face it: it is definitely an anti-Republican show. My political leanings tend to be Republican but I still find humor in seeing how far Bush haters will go. Though light-hearted at times, the show paints the Bush team as heartless and self-centered to an almost inhumane degree. The parts that go way over-the-top, strangely enough, involve Barbara Bush! What did she ever do to deserve such nastiness??

Lil' George and his cronies are in a band and there are a lot of songs in these episodes. Some of them are pretty funny lyrically and catchy musically although I'm not a big fan of musical numbers in animated shows (including Family Guy) as I think they take away from more jokes, but I find myself humming some of these songs (especially, the ""Special Buddy"" song for Lil' George and Lil' Tony Blair), so I guess they're OK, but less is best where the music is concerned. Here are the episodes:

Iraq/First Kiss--Opening message: Paris Hilton. Lil' Bush sees stories about Iraq on news channels other than Fox that does not put his father's administration in a good light. For Father's Day, Lil' George goes against his inclination not to serve and finds his way into joining the military and going to Iraq in search of a ""feel-good type story"" for his dad. The ending is pretty funny. In the second segment, Lil' George and his cronies have a bet as to who gets their first kiss first. George has his sights set on Lil' Laura, and Lil' Cheney on George's mom! Lil' Bill and Hillary make an appearance (along with the Lil' Lewinski twins). Lil' Condi may end up winning the bet--but not the way she hoped.

Nuked/Camp--Opening message: Bob Barker. A foreign exchange student humiliates Lil' George and he wants revenge. Fortunately, it's 'Take Your Kid to Work Day' (Lil' Jeb goes to work with Barney to teach him how to drink out of the toilet) and Lil' George has access to weapons of mass revenge. Next, the gang go to Lil' Camp David. They find their way to Al Qaeda Camp and play pranks on them. The Jeb sidebar stuff was a bore but the arm-chewing bit was hilarious. The Lil' Bush band dress like KISS for the talent show. The ending to this one is rather weak.

Gay Friend/Mexican--Opening message: immigration. It's football tryouts, but Lil' George isn't cut out for the sport. He meets up with an agreeable, jolly English kid, Lil' Tony Blair, and they decide to be cheerleaders. Lil' George's parents are alarmed by this new friend who ""drives on the wrong side of the road."" With Lil' George preoccupied, his posse find someone else to follow around: Lil' Barack Obama. In the next segment, Lil' George doesn't like doing chores so he hires a Mexican to do his work for him (""Mexicans, they're America's greatest resource""). This episode is one of my favorites.

Global Warming/Hall Monitor--Lil' Al Gore tries to convince Lil' George and the gang that global warming will ruin the planet by taking them in a time machine to New York City 100 years in the future. Lil' George and the gang keep wanting to go back to free ice cream day (""we were so innocent then""). Highlight: Al Gore explains how he really did invent the Internet! The Lil' Bush band does a Red Hot Chili Peppers type song for Lil' Earth Day. This is my favorite segment of Lil' Bush so far. Next, Lil' George becomes Hall Monitor but his authority is challenged by Lil' John McCain. Lil' George gets advice from his Hippie brother Neil (he's George's older brother here--in real life he is 9 years younger) and uses fear to shut up McCain's ""straight talk."" Highlight: George Bush Sr. is allergic to Asians.

Evolution/Press Corps Dinner--Lil' George has problems learning evolution, especially when the kid he's cheating off of, Lil' Cheney of all people, dies of a heart attack (Don't worry, Lil' Cheney proved to be too much for Hell so he was sent back). He learns at the St. Nogaysallowedius Church that he doesn't need to learn...anything. Next, a George Bush impersonator hired to be the opening act at the Press Corps Dinner starts to invade the Bush's privacy. Lil' George feels ""nepotastic"" about being the headliner at the dinner, but he gets jokes from the Lil' Democrats.

Haunted House/Hot Dog--The Lil' Democrats play a joke on Lil' George and the gang by challenging them to spend the night in the haunted attic in the White House. Next segment, Lil' George is angry that Hot Dog Day at the school was canceled to make way for a multi-cultural lunch menu. To save Hot Dog Day, Lil' George and the gang resort to some heavy-handed methods that were filmed by documentary film maker Lil' Michael Moore.

Walter Reed-A bonus episode made in case the real VP Dick Cheney died which would make ""Evolution"" highly inappropriate (that geeky-looking guy in the preamble sure hates the VP!). Lil' Bush does not want to participate in Operation Cuddlestorm (where kids go to the front lines to hug troops) so he instead films an AC/DC style music video at the Walter Reed hospital. An unintended result is that their video shows how poor the conditions are at the hospital. As usual, though, things have a way of working out for the Bushes. Henry Rollins contributes his voice to Steve ""halfsy"" the wounded soldier who lost his left hand and leg in the war. The character looks like Rollins, too.  This is the most heavy-handed anti-Republican episode of this season.",1207612800,5,6908,4.613506916192026
