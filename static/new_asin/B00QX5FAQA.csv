6889241,2,B00QX5FAQA,I've been a yogi for 20 years and her style just did not capture my attention.  I found it boring and have not been using it. I recommend the Namaste Yoga series or Baron Baptiste.,1478044800,2,180,4.142857142857143

6889244,5,B00QX5FAQA,"This is by far the best Yoga DVD I've owned, and have owned quite a few.
The production quality is terrific, background music is perfect and of course, Tara is most amazing in her approach and technique.
She is soft spoken and guides you through the moves very well.  You really don't need to look up to see what she is doing to follow along.
Thank you Tara Lee for a beautiful DVD gift! Peace & Namaste.
Oh, on other thing, be sure to do the guided meditations on the  bonus area! Absolutely fantastic!
Cheers then!

6889245,5,B00QX5FAQA,I am very new to yoga and the first in the series Earth is wonderful,1474675200,,68,3.6
6889246,5,B00QX5FAQA,"Great job Tara Lee. I have tried many yoga dvd's and this by far is one of the best! The fire dvd is my favorite so far, yes it is challenging but I love it!",1473984000,2,157,3.5142857142857142
6889247,4,B00QX5FAQA,"I am beginner/intermediate in yoga. I like Tara's video, but I really think it's more for intermediate/advanced overall. I was able to keep up for the most part, but she does several poses that I couldn't attempt in my dizziest daydreams. But she does give nice narration - she talks about the reasons for each movement, what they mean and what they do in the body, which I found interesting and made the experience richer. I also liked her breath work  - I'd never been in a yoga class where we did different types of breath work like that, so it was great to learn and do.

She does flow a bit quickly in and out of poses, so if you are just beginning yoga this is going to be way too fast for you. Sometimes I felt like she got us into a pose only to immediately get us back out without getting to feel the full presence of the pose, but that's just my opinion. I tend to enjoy restorative and yin-types of yoga better than fast-paced vinyasa flows.

I will say that she's put together great programs that have definitely increased my strength and balance. It's just that I think I'm not quite advanced enough for her and not quite flexible enough to keep up with what she does. In one of the Fire Dynamic programs she pulls her legs over her head and balances her toes on her forehead, almost like someone off Cirque De Soleil, and I am just never going to be able to do that with my back. She doesn't offer any kind of alternate for this pose, so I was left twiddling my thumbs during that sequence.

Overall pleased but definitely do not recommend this for a beginner or new intermediate.",1472428800,14,1594,4.321070234113712

6889251,5,B00QX5FAQA,"I am new to yoga and I was a little nervous to start because a) I am not flexible at all; and b) I'm really out of shape. However, this DVD set is amazing! Tara Lee is a soothing, encouraging trainer and with the three DVDs included, all skill levels of the potential user are met.

I started with the Foundation DVD, and while I was sweating towards the end - it was quite enjoyable and I truly felt so relaxed afterwards. Tara guides you through the poses and breathing with a serene voice, and the beautiful scenery of the background is also calming and enjoyable.

While I have a tendency to start things and never see them through; this DVD set has honestly made me fall in love with yoga and really fostered the desire to keep with it - I am really excited to see how I progress (and  gain better balance and flexibility!)

I absolutely recommend this DVD set, regardless of your current yoga skill level. If it can make a believer out of me, I have faith that any potential users out there in Amazon Land will love it as well! :)",1466467200,18,1036,4.270408163265306

6889253,5,B00QX5FAQA,"My favorite yoga series of all time. I use this one everyday. The yoga poses shapes my arms and legs beautifully without it being too strenuous. She has three 20 minute sections in each of the elements, or you can play the whole 69 minute workout without interruption. She delivers each workout so if you're concerned about balancing chakras, you can do this simultaneously. Top notch! Namaste",1462752000,9,393,4.880597014925373

6889259,4,B00QX5FAQA,"I have done the air and water flow so far. It is very near to a flow class that I do at a local studio. Very good music , and look. I will update as I try the other 2 dvds.",1456963200,,172,3.2195121951219514
6889260,5,B00QX5FAQA,"Tara has produced a great workout DVD.  I have only done the Earth Element so far, as I am trying to rehab after an accident.  I like the faster pace of Tara's workout.  This is a fantastic addition to the Candle Light Yoga that I already have, which is great for stretching out and calming down in the evening.",1456790400,,311,4.237288135593221
6889261,5,B00QX5FAQA,Tara Lee is a fabulous teacher. Her healing energy is amazing.  I recommend buying this box set for all levels. Tara Lee you rock!,1456531200,,130,4.416666666666667

6889265,4,B00QX5FAQA,"I've taking a bunch of yoga classes over the years and wanted to start a more regular practice in my home. My wife got this DVD for me and I'm really enjoying it. Tara has a great energy and each workout is broken down into three 20 minute sessions so you can do one, two or all three together, which is great because I have different time available each day.

I would call myself at intermediate skill level and feel it's a very nice blend of easy to more advanced poses so that people at all skill levels should enjoy it (although it might be a little easy for very advanced people).

Definitely recommended.",1454716800,3,610,4.342105263157895

6889267,5,B00QX5FAQA,"I wanted to get back into practicing yoga. So, after reading all the positive reviews, I decided to give Tara's videos a try. I am so glad I did.  My favorite is Air and Water as she walks you step by step on how to breath and stretch correctly. Great stress release. I am looking forward to the other two dvds in the set.",1453334400,2,322,4.03125
6889268,5,B00QX5FAQA,"This Yoga 3 DVD set is very low impact and gentle on the body. I have been practicing yoga for three weeks now and yes it if an effective workout yes you will sweat and yes are arms will tremble, and yes are going to have a good cardio work out, and yes you will gain increased flexibility, and each work segment is about 22-30 minutes in length.  The most challenging yoga DVD without a doubt thus far that I have practiced with ( keep in mind this is still basic yoga) is Kino. So comparing Kino to Tara Lee, Tara is much more gentle. The entire point of getting the full benefits of yoga is that you HAVE to practice 6-7 days a week for 20 minutes a day. It's that simple and if you do not have that little amount of time you should consider a different work out program that would be the equivalent. Best part, the special features on each DVD. If you are looking for a challenging core work out this is what you need to do. Get a strong core, stronger and more flexible body and get rid of the unwanted fat from problem areas",1452729600,14,1030,4.124378109452737
6889269,5,B00QX5FAQA,"These videos have some challenging parts and certainly get you working hard.  what I love best is that, as described, you come away with the feeling of the element featured in each video.",1448841600,,187,4.666666666666667
6889270,5,B00QX5FAQA,"This is an awesome collection of Tara's dvds.  We started using the Earth and Water practices for our lunchtime yoga at work.  Everyone loved them and most who attend went out and bought their own copies to use at home.  When one of our regulars retired, we bought her this set as a goodbye present.  I've owned all three myself for the past several years and never tire of them.  Earth and Water are excellent for beginners and those who are older or a little less flexible. Fire is the most difficult, but it is still great.  I'm an amateur fighter (Thai boxing) and find that these are a great compliment to the intense training I do at the gym.  My hips, lower back and hamstrings get incredibly tight but Tara's sequences provide excellent stretching and gentle strengthening.",1447113600,17,781,4.615942028985507

8693200,4,B00QX5FAQA,"I have only done fire so far but I plan to work my way through them all.  Fire is challenging and has set a goal for me to keep at it.  I am interested in chakras and that is one reason I became interested in purchasing the complete set.  Also the reviews I read were encouraging that I would find help with these programs.

8693201,5,B00QX5FAQA,"I love these dvds. They range from easier to harder so it has something for everyone. Even if you are past the beginning stage of yoga I believe that you can get a lot out of these. Tara Lee makes it easy to follow along without having to try and look at the screen. If you are newer to yoga though, I would recommend watching them first. This set has become a regular part of my routine. I look forward to trying more of Tara Lee's yoga dvds.",1487289600,,443,4.045454545454546
