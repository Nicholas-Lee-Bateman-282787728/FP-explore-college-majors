6351440,1,B00JAD6DHW,Could only see 1 movie. No option to see the rest. Where are they? Poor quality picture. Waste of money,1419811200,11,103,4.2
6351441,4,B00JAD6DHW,"This is less of a review and more of an opinion. People buy these bargain basement sets expecting to find 15 great movies for almost nothing apiece. Then they are disappointed when the movies turn out to be well b movies. Well, that's what you get for almost nothing. So, please don't buy the movies if you expect a lot for your money. There is a reason that these movies are so cheap, they are not great, but they are good to collectors like myself. While I don't own this particular set, I do have 4 of the movies included here and yes they are b movies, but they are enjoyable non the less. Look, you get what you pay for. You want a great movie you pay a minimum of $5 to $24 per movie. You want less quality, you pay a lot less.  These movies are public domain movies, meaning that the owners no longer are willing to pay for the copyright oh them, there is a great reason for that, they are not worth the price of the copyright to the owners. Please keep that in mind when you purchase on of these bargain basement sets.

6351444,1,B00JAD6DHW,ONE Steven Seagal movie in this collection. Very bad deceptive marketing. There were a few Chuck Norris movies and the rest was a collection of unwatchable supposedly ACTION movies. Maybe MST3K creators would like this collection.,1409702400,6,230,5.416666666666667

6351448,1,B00JAD6DHW,"I was scammed by Wal-Mart with this falsely advertised collection. 3- Chuck Norris movies that I already have, 1-Steven Seagal movie, and the rest are the most boring amateur movies that I have even seen. I was under the illusion that false advertisement was still against the law, amazing how fast times have changed, and how some are so accepting of it to try and defend such actions. It is definitely a rip-off, not worth $1.00 for this collection.",1480550400,,451,4.7215189873417724

6351465,2,B00JAD6DHW,"We took a chance on this one. It didn't exceed expectations, that's for sure. Indeed there is only 1 Seagal movie and like 3 Norris movies. None of these movies are well known. I've maybe heard of two of them, and that may be wishful thinking.

If you cram 5 movies onto a single DVD, you're going to get poor quality. Image quality is quite bad for a movie made in the last 50 years. The titles are blurry, heck everything is blurry. Each movie is about 1 GB of data (whereas a good movie is more like 6-7 GB.) Stereo sound, no fancy surround sound. No subtitles in case you can't hear something due to the lo-fi sound. Avoid.",1453680000,2,627,4.225

6351474,3,B00JAD6DHW,"It's a bit amusing when there's complaints that some of the movies in a 15 for five bucks set are boring or plain bad.
You can't buy ONE new film for a fin, or see one at a theater for that price.
So what if even half of the fifteen are turkeys? That's still seven or eight decent ones that cost pocket change each.

As for ECHO BRIDGE, their dub quality has steadily improved over the years.
Back when they were known as PLATINUM PLUS, this outfit sold transfers that were worse than SLP videotapes.
Blurry images. lots of film scratches, edit breaks, faded colors, snow in the picture and weak lo-fi sound.
They also had the most annoying habit of a constant on-screen watermark.

Not anymore. I feel quite sure that any ECHO BRIDGE DVDs I buy will be of fine quality,
thus there was no hesiation when I encountered this 15 movie bundle at my local ""big W.""

Seagal and Norris aside, here's a quick glance at the ""other"" movies in these 15....
.

Based on IMDb data (rated 4.1), TUNNEL VISION (2013) is surely one of this set's throwaways.
It has a no-name cast in a well-worn story of a man seeking revenge for the murders of his family.

In tepid rated (4.9) video-only THE SWEEPER (1996), C. Thomas Howell is a cop that (guess what?) is
the survivor of a murdered cop dad and family. He falls in with vigilantes out to cap some criminals.
Also with Jeff Fahey and Ed Lauter.

Some OK casting in THE CHAOS FACTOR (2000), another low IMDb rated film (4.6).
With Antonio Sabato Jr., Fred Ward and R. Lee Ermey. Here, an Army Intel officer is sent to 'Nam
long after the war to find left-behind American land mines and other material. Instead he uncovers
a soldier's diary that tells of atrocities inflicted on civilians by our own soldiers.

ED MCBAIN'S 87TH PRECINCT: ICE (1996) is one of three TV movies loosely based on the novel
and 1961 cop show series. Joe Pantoliano's Det. Meyer Meyer was originally played by Norman Fell,
aka ""Mr. Roper"" on THREE'S COMPANY.

THE SPY KILLER (1969) is this collection's ""antique."" An ABC TV movie made in the UK, it stars
Robert Horton, Sebastian Cabot and Jill St. John in a story of an ex-spy who's coerced back into
the shadow service. Has a decent 6.4 rating.

At an anemic 3.6 IMDb rating, PREY OF THE JAGUAR (1996) may be our barrel bottom. The plot?
Uhhh...a special ops agent's wife and child are murdered by a drug lord, so he learns martial arts
and... eh, you know.
Apparently even having Maxwell Caulfield, Stacy Keach and Linda Blair in it doesn't help this one.",1426809600,7,2518,4.4803493449781655

8649363,4,B00JAD6DHW,"As virtually all the reviewers stated, this collection is very misleading. It implies that virtually all of the films on the discs feature Steven Seagal and a few feature Chuck Norris. This is not true. The truth is that just a handful feature these two actors and the rest feature other actors. Those with Seagal and Norris are full of action and are generally good. The others are for the most part B films some better than others. The package sells for about $2 on Amazon and is a good buy because of the Seagal and Norris films and some of the others. Viewers who need subtitles because they are hearing impaired should not buy the package because it does not have this feature.",1527465600,,682,4.508064516129032
