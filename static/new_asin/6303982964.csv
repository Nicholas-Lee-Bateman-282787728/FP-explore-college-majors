Did it deliver? It sure did. By the end of the movie, Roogie's bump swelled up so much, the doctor could only describe it as a cancer. I was in tears. Beautiful film.

7908556,5,6303982964,"Certainly, this is a small, independent film, in black and white, and some kids won't sit still for that. Still, it's a terrific story of hope and encouragement for kids who have been bullied. There is bad acting, weak direction and lots of other stuff, and most kids couldn't care less. What there IS, is some inventful special effects, and a sweet story about a kid who can beat the odds. I really think all little kids should see this. I saw it when I was about 7, and saw it again a few years ago on TCM. I taped it. They are colorizing everything these days. This is an uplifting film that all little kids will appreciate, letting them know that there is a light at the end of that long tunnel of kid-dom. Highly recommended.",1314316800,,730,4.335766423357664
7908557,2,6303982964,I saw this movie in it's original release when I was 7 years old.  Back then I thought it was a wonderful movie.  After watching it again for the first time in 55 years I found it to be really a slow boring movie with very bad acting and looking like it was made on the lowest of budgets; almost unwatchable. I don't think kids of today would like it at all. The only bright spots are being able to see some of the Brooklyn Dodgers' icons from the 50's and the acting of Ruth Warrick who put out a nice performance despite an awful script. although there is a lesson here about bullying it's very hard to suffer through this horrible movie to learn it.,1251936000,4,652,4.166666666666667
