2900759,5,B000TGWR7E,"Is there anyone out there listening to the pleas of the Judging Amy fans? Believe me there are more than just these few posters who would love to see a boxed dvd set come out....I just loved this show for its honesty and unflinching portrayal of our not-so perfect juvenile system, from the eyes of a judge and social worker....Amy made so many choices that had me yelling at her on the tv screen to plug in and get a clue! And Maxine, what a wonderfully complex, now-you like her, now-you don't personality...what a shame it would be for the powers that be to ignore our requests for this series to become available for purchase....I'm crossing my fingers, waiting....",1212105600,30,669,4.630252100840337
2900760,5,B000TGWR7E,Please release the Judging Amy TV Series!  It was a great show and Amy Brenneman and Tyne Daly were dynamic.  I would love to own this series and would buy it in a heart-beat!  Please release the DVD already!,1211932800,18,208,4.282051282051282
2900761,5,B000TGWR7E,This was a great tv show.  I would buy it immediately if it ever came out on dvd.  I can't believe that they won't put it out there for the fans!,1207440000,40,145,3.6451612903225805
2900762,5,B000TGWR7E,"Rather than reading a series of mostly ""rave"" reviews, I would rather that the DVDs of this outstanding television drama be released.  It simply was one of the best ... cast, performances, writing, courageous subject matter.  Just release these! This series is a must for collectors and a not-to-be-missed performance by Tyne Daly.

(I foolishly bought DVDs of  Judging Amy, out of desperation, from Canada...DO NOT DO THIS!  They were poor quality and had a haze of red on all episodes AND it was expensive.  When I tried to return them for poor quality no one answered the phones or responded to emails.  I believe this is the ""region two"" listed here on  Amazon.)",1200528000,97,666,4.780701754385965
2900763,5,B000TGWR7E,"Judging Amy was a daily luxury. I'd tivo episodes I had seen easily twenty times before, and snuggle deeper into the couch to watch.
When TNT discontinued the series in rerun, I was honestly crushed.
This gives me hope.
Please, for the love of Pete, release the DVD's already.
What does this mean, anyway? Are they giving us a release date? WHAT'S THE DEAL?

2900764,5,B000TGWR7E,"Judging Amy caught my eye all those years ago originally because of the presence of the great Tyne Daly, an actor with an awesome range more than capable of keeping us entranced week after week, as was proved in Cagney and Lacey, numerous films, and now of course as the social worker, and
widowed mother of three grown up off spring, one of whom is Amy,(played so realistically by Amy Brenneman)a childrens court judge and a chip off the old block.
Amy is a divorced mother with a daughter Lauren. She and Lauren move back into the the family home where she once again has to learn to negotiate with her bossy, self opinionated mother, the magnificent Maxine (Tyne Daly),her gentle younger brother Vincent (Dan Futterman) and reconnect with older brother Peter(Marcus Giamatti)who runs the family business,an insurance agency originally belonging to their late father, and his dippy high strung wife Gillian (Jessica Tuck).
The interesting saga about Amy and Maxine, in particular, is that they are both deeply caring human beings, whose working lives are dedicated to making the lives of others (mostly children in both cases) a more hopeful and positive experience than it otherwise would have been. And both are very good at what they do. Maxine is regarded with some awe by her co-workers in the Dept of Corrections, and Amy gradually developes into a fine Children's Court Judge.
Yet it is in their private lives that overall turmoil threatens to unravel them, because despite coming from a close-knit family environment all three of Maxine's children find that negotiating long term successful partnerships seems to be beyond them.
Judging Amy doesn't allow itself to become melodramatic, and there is never a likelihood of the viewer over dosing on sacharine. The scripts are strong, the acting first rate, the storyline never feels it's losing it's edge (an achievement of no mean feat over six series) and flawed though the characters may be, this only adds to the sense of reality and and understanding we feel as we share in their tials and tribulations.
Amy Brenneman deserves full marks for developing an idea she had to write a series about her mother,then produce and star in it.
The casting of Tyne Daly, was a crucial part of Judging Amy's success as a series, and the performances of Richard T Jones as Bruce Van Exel, Tim Omundson as Sean (Maxine's boss) and Jillian Armenante as Amy's court clerk Donna,were consistently outstanding.
Now bring on the DVD Boxed Set.",1198972800,107,2486,4.935560859188544
2900765,5,B000TGWR7E,"Daniel Futterman, Jillian Armenante and Richard Krenna also added to the diversity of personalities in this cast. Oh, and Richard Jones as Bruce...tv debut of Grey's Anatomy star, Sandra OH, and oh so many others. A socially sensitive show, looking at the juvenile court and foster care system from two viewpoints, Amy's hard edged one, and her mother Maxine's tender lioness one. And Maxine's supervisor, Shawn...can't remember his name. But I mourned the loss of each of their characters.

It was a beautiful run. Lots of failed romances, depression and miscommunication, but always a heart in this show. I long to get it on DVD...truly...ache for it.",1196812800,65,653,5.102803738317757
2900766,4,B000TGWR7E,"Judging Amy is funny, moving, and poignant.
Amy's no-nonsense approach to the situations that arise in her court room (weather very serious, intense or comical) is a nice escape from the sad truth of the judicial system today.  I can relate to Amy with some of the situations she's faced with in her personal life, the emotions that sometimes get in the way, and the inability to just let some things go.
The interaction between her employees and family is at times very amusing.

Tyne Daly's performance is excellent as Amy's mother.  I love her sarcastic sense of humor, and the way she deals with some of the ridiculous situations she's faced with as a social worker. Sometimes bureaucracy forces her to take drastic measures in order to successfully do her job and save some of the lost souls who desperately need her help.

Also like the addition of Maxine's nephew, Kyle which brings a little medical drama to the show (since I'm also a fan of ER, House, Bones, CSI Las Vegas, Crossing Jordan...)",1188950400,52,1002,4.708571428571428

So, my sis bought me the first season at least two years ago and since then I haven't been able to find the rest of the series in UK format.

Tyne Daly, with her strong, old-fashioned values outshone everyone in this series but, having said that, the rest of the characters fitted in well together and actually came across as a genuine family unit.

I would love to be able to collect the rest of the series.",1429142400,,546,4.3861386138613865

2900800,5,B000TGWR7E,Judging Amy was one of the best TV series I have ever had the pleasure of seeing. It was the older actors cast that made the series exceptional. Please try to get the series released in this country. What are they waiting for. It is like the movie Love Letters with Jennifer Jones and Joseph Cotton. I had to wait for years to get a DVD of this movie. There are so many good movies and TV series that would make Amazon a lot of money on Instant Video; you should have somebody investigate a way to contract them.,1427673600,2,512,4.181818181818182
2900801,1,B000TGWR7E,The DVD is not made to play on USA equipment; only for UK. Some dispute with the network.  Amy Brennamen said she thinks it's quite unfair and wishes the network would release it for the USA.,1415491200,2,191,4.305555555555555

2900805,5,B000TGWR7E,I have been patiently waiting for YEARS to be able to purchase this series on DVD....why haven't they released it?  It cannot be because there aren't enough fans....I have seen many many series for sale that weren't nearly as great as this show.  This would make a great gift for the holidays and for myself!  The acting of the entire cast is some of the best...and the story lines were interesting and powerful...and there was a lot of humor as well.

2900806,5,B000TGWR7E,"I completely agree with the other reviewers who have written rave reviews of the wonderful series.  I, too, purchased the series from a rogue dealer and was very disappointed in the quality of the DVD's that I received.  They were quite expensive.

2900818,5,B000TGWR7E,"Recently Judging Amy reruns returned to GMC. I had missed this wonderful production when it was a regular on TV.
I want the Judging Amy CD's so that I can share the goodness of life with my twin granddaughters who are now four (4). There are so few quality life-lesson shows available now. Judging Amy makes you feel good about the human race (and there are still people out there like Amy and her amazing mother, played by Tyne!!) The humor and subject matter are perfectly entwined! The writers of this production were genious - where are they now? I absolutely treasure my recorded Judging Amy shows - and will hold on to them until I can get the CD's!",1325980800,7,655,4.466666666666667
2900819,5,B000TGWR7E,"Judging Amy was, by far, one of the best TV Series ever! Nothing beats having your own DVD set.  What will it take before CBS or whomever releases it on DVD?  I know Amy Brenneman was an executive producer and creator of the show, but does that mean she has the rights to the show to release on DVD?  GMC network is running the show for 2 hours a day and I truly appreciate it.  But today, the did not show the Series Finale ""My Name is Amy Gray"".  This one episode culminates the whole entire series!  You see the passion she has for the welfare of the children caught in bureaucratic red tape of the judicial system.  It brings to full circle her desire to make a change. Since GMC neglected to show the series finale, I did a search and found all episodes of all 6 seasons (with no commercial interruptions or missing scenes) at [...]

Now, by no means am I saying to download these, but it's nice to have a place you can go to look at the full episodes of all 6 seasons UNTIL SOMEONE RELEASES THE DVD SET!!!!!!!!!!  Can we sign a petition and send it somewhere?",1316563200,8,1065,4.206896551724138

2900821,5,B000TGWR7E,"Besides the Gilmore Girls, which incidently is an incredible box set available to all die-hard fans, Judging Amy would be a hit.  Clearly, the fans that gave their reviews have been dissapointed with the gaps and quality of what little is out there.  The actors and story line was so amazing that for years I would make sure what station was running the old episodes and set my VCR and then my DVR to get every possible moment of this memorable series.  I, and apparently many fans, want to know ""WHAT IS THE PROBLEM"".  AMAZON has always been my favorite place to order books, music and movies.  I have a feeling that if you folks put your heads together YOU COULD MAKE THIS HAPPEN...THE ENTIRE SERIES.  JUST DO IT...IT'S GOOD BUSINESS AND YOUR CUSTOMERS WOULD BE EXTREMELY IMPRESSED.

AMAZON...please post an update  -  Thank you for providing great product, this would be the icing on the cake!",1311811200,15,896,4.656050955414012
2900822,5,B000TGWR7E,"Not just the great actors and actresses make this series so very special but also the fact that these are NORMAL people with NORMAL and very human problems and troubles they go through. They deal with it, they live with it. And we can learn alot about life, relationships and human behavior if we watch closely and just let us fall into it. From each character there is, we can take something and think ""This is great, I want to be a little more like that, too.""
And the wisdom of Maxine, her comments mostly, is awesome! So is Amy herself who is in everything she does very honest, strong and human.",1310515200,6,600,4.366071428571429

It's inapprehensible to me, why an american TV Series is published in Norway and Australia first, but is still not available in the US - Anyway, I just want to share that information with everybody impatiently waiting for the release of Judging Amy in the US

Update Jan. 23.2011 - Apparently the complete Series is available in a DVD Box Set that contains all 138 episodes in NTSC Format, I just ordered the Box Set and look forward the delivery....

Update Feb. 19.2011 - Unfortunately the ordered ""Complete Series"" turns out to be fraud from a chinise company, which call themselves TVDVDSTORE and deliver cheap and damaged pirate copys of popular TV shows. By contrast the australien release with dvdorchard is a legal high quality edition.

One episode that really caught my eye was the one a young boy accidentally shoots and kills his younger sister only meaning to scare them he did not know that the gun he had still had bullets in it. When the boy was being sentenced it was the reaction of the boy and the ADA when he said it not enough, the was finally stopped the court officer and finally showed remorse ""I shot my sister!"" and Amy asked ""Did you know that the gun was loaded?""  and was the best episode.

CSI, too much violence.  Pushing Daisies, too macabre.]  ""Judging Amy"" wasn't intended to give ""Law & Order"" or ""Boston Legal"" a run for their money.

2900863,5,B000TGWR7E,"Judging Amy was my favorite show on TV!  I didn't watch it from the begninning when it was on CBS but caught the last couple of seasons when it orginally aired.  I taped it everyday it was on TNT and watched it every evening.  I really miss this show!!  Even tho I have seen every single episode, I watched it daily!  Please release it to DVD so I can start purchasing them!!  LOL.  Talk about addiction!!",1216857600,9,405,4.25
2900864,5,B000TGWR7E,"Judging Amy was, by far, one of the smartest, most genuine TV shows I have ever watched.  I didn't watch it when it was part of CBS's regular lineup, I only started watching it when TNT aired it.  I started watching it when I became a stay-at-home mom over 2 years ago - it was the perfect show to relish, laugh with and cry with as I began the amazing journey of motherhood.  I literally cried when TNT stopped airing it.  I'm waiting anxiously for the DVD release of this outstanding show!",1214092800,16,491,4.304347826086956

2900866,5,B000TGWR7E,"Like ER and several other bygone greats, I didn't watch ""Judging Amy"" when it was on real time.  But, I have seen every rerun and have learned a great deal from this television drama. It's funny, heart-tugging, thought provoking, and excellently produced.

My two college-aged sons (one will be a kindergarten teacher, the other will be a policeman) will learn creative ways to approach the individuals they'll be dealing with ... when they receive their full set of seasons for Christmas.

Please, whoever is responsible for holding ""Amy,"" read/judge all our posts and release her to us.  Thank you.

Court is adjourned!",1213056000,7,621,5.049019607843137
