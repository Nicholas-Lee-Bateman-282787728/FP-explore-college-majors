7880170,5,6304966334,"My ex-husband is in this documentary - The very last part on the Fish Creek Ranch.  This documentary covers two ranches in Southern UT and one in N. Nevada. The other segment is about rodeo- as I recall mostly barrel racing and women in rodeo. Narrated by Joseph Campanella for a PBS showing in 1991.  Always wondered why when being interviewed and talking about caring for the little calves, and caring for your horse, one of the cowboys interviewed didn't see the value in taking care of his kids he abandoned! But the family rancher at the ranch where some outlaw was to have hid shows a good family man and saves the cowboys reputation!",1304640000,,640,4.556521739130435
