I can't believe the wwf DVD was better!  An I hate McMahon an his product. This was sickening,  disgusting  and ridiculously distracting watching Ric chew tobacco spit and droll all over himself, an his water bottle every 6 seconds.  it was the most disgusting interview I ever watched, chew dripping down his chin, chew stick in his teeth! Makin weird suck noises an spitting! the interviewer next time has to forbid this from happening! I can't believe they allowed that!  awful.",1485129600,,635,4.535087719298246

8317461,5,B001L6V948,Whether you liked Ric Flair or not.  Great In Depth Interview. Really made understand the NWA.  Really did well up to 88 when Crockett sold to Ted Turner.  I am a bigger better Bret Hart Fan.  I wish I could find more Bret Hart and Ric Flair stuff.  In conclusion Rice Flair gave you an honest interview and you money's worth.  Best Wrestling DVD interview I've ever purchased hands down.,1440892800,,388,4.4714285714285715
