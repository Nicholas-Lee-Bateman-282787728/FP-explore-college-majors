8148061,3,B000IZJRBU,"NOT one of Akshay's best films. Even the professional wrestler The Undertaker didn't help. Akshay actually got injured while fighting him in the movie. If it weren't for the fact that he looks good, I wouldn't have watched it after the first 30 mins. (I do give all movies a fair chance b4 turning it off). His other Khiladi films are much better.",1448496000,,347,4.523809523809524

8148066,5,B000IZJRBU,"I was an extra in this movie. The really long shot at Toronto city hall was so interesting, mainly in how the photographer orchestrated the actors' walk and the long track the camera moved on. There was a lot of excitement on the set when the stars showed up on set in their white limousine. Hundreds of fans from the Punjab were jostling to get onto the set and police actually had to hold them back. Also, the fight scenes at the top of the Queen's Quay condos were a blast.",1322179200,8,476,4.241758241758242

8148068,5,B000IZJRBU,"Akshay Kumar plays a super strong and smart hero in this thrilling and exciting, action, adventure, romantic Bollywood movie from 1996. Akshay`s character  is like superman and super stud fighting the giant wrestler the undertaker and saving his brother Ajay (inder kumar) from the evil madam maya and romancing beautiful women like raveena tandon and rekha. Raveena tandon`s character priya is madly in love with Akshay  ,while madam maya (rekha) is impressed with his physical prowess and intellect. Akshay`s character has the strength, brains, confidence, fighting skills and near magical ability to beat guys bigger and stronger than him.
