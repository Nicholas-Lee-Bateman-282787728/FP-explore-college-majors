8183883,1,B000O785ZQ,"THE CLOWN MURDERS, 1976 - It's Halloween night and four friends, all dressed as clowns, kidnap an enemy's wife as a joke - and to ruin a real estate deal.  Then, things begin to go terribly sour.

Third billed John Candy's only ""horror"" film also features his only sex scene.  (Yeah, you read that right.)  I bought this because it was the only John Candy film I had never seen - and it takes place on my favorite holiday, Halloween.

Everything about this film is wrong.  Baby-faced John Candy is ridiculed and abused throughout the film.  His character is relegated to the clich one-dimensional fat guy.  He never stops eating and his friends never stop commenting on that fact.  John is humiliated and beaten up by a guy half his size and weeps uncontrollably as he is tied up and slapped around.  I felt so embarrassed for Candy - the actor, not the character he was portraying.

None of the plot hung together for me.  (Maybe I'm just dumb.)  L-o-n-g static scenes with dialog that did nothing to explain motivations or advance the narrative made the 96 min. film play like a 3-parter mini series.  While I felt for Candy, there wasn't a likable character in the whole cast.

This movie committed the worst sin of all - it was B-O-R-I-N-G!  Don't watch this one in a room with a timepiece.  You will get whiplash glancing back-and-forth between the TV and the clock.

This one falls just a skosh short of a positive recommendation.",1504656000,,1436,4.586614173228346
8183884,1,B000O785ZQ,there was no killer clown everybody dressed up as a clown for the halloween party four friends kidnap a woman that they know and that was basicly it its not worth the time or money for anyone to buy and its really boring,1409097600,,220,4.1395348837209305
8183885,1,B000O785ZQ,"THE CLOWN MURDERS begins w/ a scintillating game of polo between a group of pompous rich guys. Lawrence Dane (SCANNERS, HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO ME) plays the head zillionaire, Phillip Sutherland. John Candy plays poor, persecuted Ollie. Shortly thereafter, it's time for the big Halloween party. The rest of the group decides to pull a prank on Phillip. Needless to say, things don't go exactly according to plan, resulting in police involvement. One of the pranksters is up to something more than simply playing a trick. THE CLOWN MURDERS is a not-very entertaining, non-thrilling, fairly idiotic film. It also commits the unpardonable sin of being extremely boring! I kept waiting, no, praying for something, anything remotely interesting to happen! Well, at the mid-way point, a mysterious figure dons a discarded clown mask, and begins stalking around. I actually wept at this point! Alas, after several more precious minutes elapse, nothing of any consequence takes place. Oh, people do eventually, blessedly die. By then however, I was ready for death myself! This is a damned shame, since the final 10 minutes are pretty intense. If only the other 86 minutes had been as entertaining... WARNING: Contains the infamous John Candy love scene!...",1403568000,,1244,5.225
8183886,4,B000O785ZQ,Product arrived on time and in great condition but I have not had a chance to watch this movie yet so I cannot comment on the content of this movie.,1398556800,,148,3.966666666666667
8183887,1,B000O785ZQ,Actually I didn't like this movie at all compared to many other clown movies that I have. Kind of dull and no plot.,1395187200,,115,4.043478260869565
8183888,2,B000O785ZQ,"The Clown Murders (1976) was a complete waste of time; vulgar, little point, no conclusion, simply terrible.

The slow moving plot underwhelmed me. The situation of the characters was impossible to believe. I felt the only excitement of this movie comes when the Clown makes or attempts a kill. The dialogue was so unsatisfactory and the characters are set up to be generally hated. The dialogue was delivered like a bad soap opera show left on the cutting room floor. All of the actors should not have been hired.

The characters are all one-dimensional caricatures (I know that's the point, it doesn't mean I have to like it though), the rambling, wandering story doesn't go anywhere, and when all is said and done, the movie doesn't even really end so much as it just stops.

There is absolutely no redeeming value in The Clown Murders (1976). I really could not be entertained by it. One minute into the movie and I felt like turning it off.

Skip the movie and a book.",1382918400,,973,4.6395348837209305

8183891,3,B000O785ZQ,"This movie is very creepy and the clown killer is awesome, very creppy and provides the best parts of the film when he actually shows up.  But the cover art is rather decieving, it looks amazing but to show a cool graveyard with a clown & Machette full of blood makes people rather dissapointed after seeing this film.  Over all a strange film that as the previous reviewer stated is unsure of exactally what it wants to be, if the Clown was in it more and had more scary parts like he was limited to this film would have gotten 5 stars.",1184630400,7,537,4.254901960784314
8183892,3,B000O785ZQ,"""The Clown Murders""(1976) featuring an early performance from a young and un-funny John Candy is one of those foggy oddball but some-what creepy films that only the 1970's could cough up. The film seems like it doesn't quite know what it wants to do with itself yet still manages to have a eerie feel to it that seems to consistantly grow throughout. The climax, even though pretty tame held up to todays standards(though all over the place as well) still makes you feel somewhat dirty & abused...like being forced to witness something that you shouldn't have.
In the end a film like this may not be for everyone but for those of you who (like myself) really have a sweet tooth for those obscure lost 70's weirdy flicks ""The Clown Murders"" is pretty much a keeper.",1182643200,8,764,4.625
