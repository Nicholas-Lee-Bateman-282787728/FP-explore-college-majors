8374159,3,B002MXN24E,LEFT SOMETHING TO BE DESIRED!,1448409600,,29,5.0
8374160,2,B002MXN24E,"I thought it was amusing - again, with judicious use of the fast forward - I don;t know what my tolerance would be without being able to ""decipher"" the ""plot"" and ""humor"" without triple speed subtitle playback.",1446163200,,210,4.702702702702703
8374161,1,B002MXN24E,"At least they tell you up front that the movie will "" Suck"". Makeup and visual effects were above average. But the storyline was poor and just too silly to even be funny.",1438041600,,170,4.181818181818182
8374162,5,B002MXN24E,"This has got to be a cult classic, what a sleeper.  Not many people know about this movie and when they hear the alternate title, they kind of shy away, but it really is hysterical.  Sure it's a bit corny; but funny really funny and don't forget the babes! Get this one, it's one of those you can easily watch again and again.",1341273600,,326,4.158730158730159
8374163,4,B002MXN24E,A slapstick comedy about friends going to a party hosted by vampires.  It was funny and predictable.  I was a bid disappointed in the count count who is suppose to be the boss.  The count's property gets stolen and he corners the thieves...then the sun comes up???  It's sort of disappointing. It's a nice little mind numbing movie to watch on a lazy weekend.,1299456000,,359,4.5625
8374164,4,B002MXN24E,"Had never heard heard of this dvd, and had never seen it before, but loving all things Vampire, I bought it.  First off, it's a French movie with English subtitles.  Now that is not a bad thing.....but when you're not expecting it.....  Figured I just had to set the dvd player to English and we'd be good to go.  Alas, that wasn't how it was to be, and I had to read the subtitles, which isn't a really big deal, once the movie flowed and you got into the characters and their lives.  Three friends, who Love to party, score some invite tickets to an exclusive party that has been rumored about for years.  They arrive in style--by helicopter--and it's loud music, sexy dancers, drinks flowing freely, comedic S&M, and long flowing, ""Fabio- manly"" locks from there on.  In the ladies restroom a little while later one of our heroines notices something amiss ( a dead body and loads of blood are a, ""dead"" give-away.)  and informs her friends that things are not quite what they seem.  What ensues is a lively cast of characters, from a vain, ditzy- ""prize"" mistress, to an ego-centric dentist, all trying to stay alive after they discover their hosts are blood thirsty vampires.  There are so many little things that you notice in the background, while the main stuff is happening-- plus one of the heroine's has a  job that helps her out for a little bit when she's going mano-a-mano with the bad guys,  and it is hilarious.  I really enjoyed this movie and my laughing was heard all the way upstairs.  If you're into the quirky and broad humor, ( such as ""Airplane"" ) and are not bothered by subtitles, then I think you will find this extremely funny as well.",1266883200,6,1662,4.51505016722408
