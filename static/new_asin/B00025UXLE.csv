8022484,3,B00025UXLE,"I was looking for a black and white video that showed a bunch of crazy inventions such as a `cow catcher' attached to a car that scooped up people, the dude that made a mouth clapping musical instrument etc...  This video compilation seemed to have most of what I was looking for.  However, the one I remembered had a different title (Maybe Gizmos or something like that, and an orange and black sheath, with a different soundtrack ""going mobile"" and more wall walkers, jumpers etc...)

Anyway, I needed this video for an inventors unit for my 5th grade class.  I will use it and it will work ok.  I was disappointed it wasn't the exact one I remember using a few years ago, but it will work.

If anyone remembers or has the one that I am looking for please let me know.",1137024000,,770,4.34965034965035
