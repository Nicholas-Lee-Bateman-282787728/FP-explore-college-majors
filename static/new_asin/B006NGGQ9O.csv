5007255,3,B006NGGQ9O,"Was it a movie? An exercise video? Turns out it is neither one; it's a documentary about yoga. I thought it was interesting and well done. One thing I had not realized was that yoga started out being dominated by men---something you would never guess when you look at classes filled by women. I enjoyed listening to the people who were interviewed for this documentary, and it was fun watching people practice yoga, as well. There is something extremely fluid and beautiful when someone moves through a series of poses. The entire thing was well worth watching. I might even watch it again sometime. I learned a lot about the many different people who practice yoga, in all circumstances and all conditions.",1401408000,,707,4.80327868852459
5007256,3,B006NGGQ9O,"It was interesting, but not really profound. I did enjoy getting ""introduced"" to a few new women in yoga. I was a little disappointed in that this movie seemed to emphasize that women who succeeding in yoga in the same way we have been measuring the success of western men in yoga- by their commercial success.",1399766400,,310,4.553571428571429
5007257,5,B006NGGQ9O,"If your thinking about taking up yoga or just curious about it, this is the movie to watch. It's very inspiring and very inclusive of all women regardless of you current physical situation. I know I'll watch this one again :)",1398902400,,225,4.512195121951219
5007258,5,B006NGGQ9O,"It was put together well. It was very inspiring. For those who even thought about doing yoga, would be convinced after seeing this documentary.",1396310400,,143,5.0
5007259,3,B006NGGQ9O,"A sales & promotional tool for all involved, but if yoga were really some magic bullet, there wouldn't be so many egomaniac, severely flawed teachers. I love yoga & have been practicing for quite a long time, but I can tell you that (at least in ashtanga) it doesn't transform anyone into this beatific creature (except when filming promos for Instagram or YouTube).

The message is good at times but if anyone wanted to make an interesting film about yoga they might try to at least admitting to some of the dark side.

This film is mainly a platform for Seane Corn, who I don't mind. She seems sincere enough. My favorite speaker was Angela Farmer. I basically liked all of them except Cyndi Lee. For some reason I got a big, inner ""ewww"" from her vibe.",1393718400,9,755,4.5036496350364965
5007260,4,B006NGGQ9O,"""Yogawoman"" (2011 release; 84 min.) takes a look at the yoga scene for woman. As the movie opens, we are given some basic facts such as the roots of yoga in India, the role (more non-role) of woman in yoga historically, and how prior to the 1960s and 70s there were no female yoga teachers in the US. That started to change some 40 years ago, with rapid expansion for women. (There is a hilarious archive clip from those early days courtesy of WCET in Cincinnati--where I live--in which Lilias Folan gives a yoga lesson.) l Nowadays, there are 20 million yoga practitioners, of which an astonishing 85% are women. As we hear testimonial after testimonial, it is clear that many believe that yoga is an excellent tool with which to battle the stress of the world we live in today.

Couple of comments: first, I couldn't help but feel that this is not an 'investigative' documentary, but rather that it is an 'educative' one, in fact almost an infomercial for a product called 'yoga'. And I'm not suggesting that this is any different from what this DVD portrays itself to be. Second, please note that the documentary is narrated by none other than Annette Bening. Third, the soundtrack is very much new-age like, in fact reminding me at times of the classic Windham Hill new age albums from the mid/late 80s. I liked the music quite a bit.

""Yogawoman"" was first released in 2011. It is now getting renewed exposure with the re-release of the DVD by US distributor Passion River, and it's also available as an Amazon Instant Video. If you are a woman and into yoga, you will definitely want to check this out. For the rest of us, it's more of a curiosity than anything else.",1393372800,5,1673,4.573333333333333
5007261,4,B006NGGQ9O,I have been practicing yoga for the last 5 years or so.  This movie was a nice reminder of all the benefits I receive from doing my practice on a regular basis.  Also it was nice to learn how yoga has and can impact the world.,1393200000,,226,3.891304347826087
5007262,5,B006NGGQ9O,"this is a wonderful movie that shows the deeper meaning of yoga for All women-young, older and so on. a must see for all yoginis",1358640000,5,128,4.16
5007263,3,B006NGGQ9O,"This is a program by some Western women Yoga practitioners/instructors using Yoga as a platform. Through the practice of Yoga asanas, they aim at understanding and coping with women's cycles of life and enhancing every aspect of life. There are sections in the video on applying Yoga to every stage from childhood to advanced age. The therapeutic value of Yoga is highly emphasized. These yoga women expand the program to attempts at managing stress, and coping with and healing serious illnesses of the body. They also reach out to the world, to some of the disadvantaged areas of Africa, improving the self-identity and self-image of the population there. They build self-esteem in the women and introduce community and social services.

It is all about women's unity and applying women's influence and power to better women and children, which will spill into all areas of their lives and make calmer, happier families and world.

This is a very good program with great ideas, but there are some questions. Do the Yoga women work in the slums and disadvantaged areas in the US? If they do, it is not included the video. Are they overlooking the needs in their own country and going all the way across the world to help? The program shows a Yoga woman working in a US detention center for teens, but nothing more on work in the depressed areas in the US.

There is one huge mistake in the video. One of the Yoga women states that women in India were not allowed to practice Yoga. This is not true at all, on two levels. Here are the facts: The old Indian culture did not allow `combined' class of men and women together in a class, especially physical programs, because it was considered immodest. Women, especially privileged women learned Yoga at home or in informal women-only settings. In India, the place of origin of Yoga Science and Philosophy, it was and is practiced as a complete system of spirituality, not just the physical culture/asanas the West does. The under-privileged population of India did not have the resources, they received their `exercise' simply through physical work. They tried calmness through prayer (Bhakti Yoga) and helpfulness to others (Karma Yoga).

The West has isolated just the one limb of Yoga- asanas/'yoga postures' from the whole system and is finding out how therapeutic just this one limb is. The few who try to practice all limbs of Yoga have a glimpse of the whole picture.

Human every-day angels have been doing service throughout history, with or without a platform. Off-the-mat project is an expansion effort of the work at the global level.",1334966400,36,2594,4.85972850678733

5007286,1,B006NGGQ9O,"Seems dated. It makes the point that women's entry into yoga is groundbreaking and revolutionary because yoga was dominated by men for thousands of years, but for someone of my generation (I'm 49), it feels like old news. All I've known are yoga classes, videos and studios dominated by women, so I didn't get a lot out of the film's statement that women have made their place in the practice of yoga. This film is dominated by white speakers and shots of thin, white, middle-class women. One person makes a statement early on that yoga is practiced by women of all colors and cultures, but we don't see or hear from many of them. The filmmaker covers yoga and pregnancy, yoga and children, yoga and acute care and yoga as stress relief. I was glad they included fat yoga (yoga for ""larger women""), but they spent exactly two minutes on it. Besides that, all the shots of yoga classes and practitioners are of thin women. It also went on for too long and got boring. The whole thing felt exclusive, tedious and dated.",1435881600,6,1017,4.562841530054645

Same thoughts for Patricia Walden, who did appear more frequently.  Blessings to you dear Teacher after years since studying with you and my condolences for the loss of your dear Teacher BKS Iyengar.  If you haven't viewed on YouTube The Feminine Unfolding i highly recommend that if you have an interest in the topic of Yoga.  That said i thought this was an interesting overview of what is going on with the ""women's movement"" called Yoga.  I wonder who the new teachers are who will fill the shoes of some of these teachers featured...that said Elena Brower lovely to see you here...",1426032000,,823,4.85

5007301,2,B006NGGQ9O,"While I liked seeing the different ways the Western Yoga community is giving back to society through various non-profits the film makers linger too long on certain segments making this film in need of editing. Not all the limbs of yoga are really explored, there is a strong leaning towards Vinyasa and flow while not representing other forms of yoga that are practiced in the West. I got the message that Power Yoga has become popular in the West with women because women in general are looking to re-claim their power. While that is possibly true, women and men are also looking for spirituality and adult growth. The spiritual aspects of yoga are given the briefest of mention in the film. I thought it was interesting that they closed the film credits with a song by Snatam Kaur but did not mention Kundalini yoga in the film, a huge oversight.",1420243200,6,848,4.66
5007302,4,B006NGGQ9O,"This is a well done documentary on women and yoga, and the power of yoga to transform lives.

I really enjoyed seeing so many female yoga teachers, famous and non-famous, talk about yoga, especially how yoga can empower women.  Some of the best moments though are when the film lets non-famous yoga practitioners speak, such as the young woman who was incarcerated for 18 months.

I highly recommend this for viewing by anyone who's interested in yoga or who wonders what all the yoga hoopla is about.",1419897600,,501,4.735632183908046

5007304,5,B006NGGQ9O,"Yogawoman is an incredible documentary on the power and influence of women in yoga. As a yoga teacher, this movie gave me pause to realize all those who have come before to make this available to each of us. What I appreciated the most was that yoga is a life, not just poses done on the mat. It is an essential element of each teacher, and that greatly influences everyone who comes in contact with them.
The only thing I would have liked, and believe it would have added to the power of the video, was more inclusivity of Kundalini Yoga. There were teachers shown in the video from this teaching, but no powerhouses like Shakta Kaur, Gurumukh Kaur Khalsa or Krishna Kaur sharing their wisdom.",1418860800,2,694,4.515873015873016
5007305,4,B006NGGQ9O,"It's pretty good, but you need to care about yoga and women's health issues. It's  basically a documentary about the history and development of women as yogis.",1415664000,,159,4.888888888888889
5007306,5,B006NGGQ9O,I loved it! I never fully realized how much yoga has changed through thousands of years and the great positive influence of women on this ancient practice and vice versa.,1412812800,,170,4.7

5007308,5,B006NGGQ9O,"Suffice it to say,U'll see a lot of women in yoga pants, but not 1 mention of how Yoga gives them a nice booty or any other such vain, superficial nonsense. This film illustrates the warmth of the female lead yoga community without any stereotypically hockey sisterhood cliches. It's feels authentic and genuinely promotes the practice of Yoga for its synergistic healing and balancing effects on the entire human system. Not a single moment was wasted on glorifying vanity or competitiveness that can sometimes pervert the purity of this ancient system. The film's tone is soft and feminine, and it's effect is that you become inspired by the stories and achievements showcased. However, the inspiration feels very internal, like an awakening, or at least the recognition that you too can become awake if you take part in this new revolution of female-centric yoga instruction.",1411948800,,878,5.104166666666667

5007313,5,B006NGGQ9O,"This is a necessary video for all yoga practitioners, women and men. There is much to learn about the evolution of Yoga over the centuries, and the recent infusion of the feminine is transformative and essential for the evolution of humankind. The only clear gap in this video is that it focuses only on a particular genre of yoga (for lack of a better descriptor). There are women making transformative contributions in other yoga traditions such as Kundalini, Ananda Marga (which has been practicing ""off the mat"" for decades), etc.",1406419200,,534,4.944444444444445
8501371,5,B006NGGQ9O,Just watched this this morning because I had some quiet time.  This movie just resonated with me and how women are faced with so many challenges and so much is put on all of our plates.  We are facing so many day to day challenges as women and yoga really can help bring us joy and steadiness.  I thought this was a beautiful movie with a lot of different points to it.
