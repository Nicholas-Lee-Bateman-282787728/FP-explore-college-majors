3936593,3,B002IJQ352,"Very facinating UFO case, this DVD is good. Some books about Billy Meier like ""Light Years"" by Kindle are better.  One problem with this DVD is that the film maker towards the end uses it as his own personal soap box to spout his own opinions about immigration etc, which are not quoted from the UFO people nor attributed to them, its probably not what they said about immigration. This is a common problem with people makeing books or films about Billy Meier, they want to spout their own opinions. People view the books or DVD to find out about Billy Meier and the Plajeans, we don't want to hear the filmaker's personal mundane opinions inserted into the production about his politics or social views. Its not a good way to make a documentary. If you make a documentary about X then you make it about X, you don't waste 10 minutes interviewing yourself about immigration.",1293667200,7,874,4.602564102564102
3936594,5,B002IJQ352,"I have been fascinated by the Meier case since I saw the first book published back in the 1970's.  At first I thought he was a nut, but after careful consideration of all of the evidence that he has put out there, there may be something to all of this.  His life story makes for a fascinating documentary.  I would highly recommend this to any one that is interested in the subject of UFOs or life elsewhere in the universe.",1289174400,15,424,4.275
3936595,5,B002IJQ352,"I had watched a UFO program on TV and this DVD was advertised on a commercial. I ordered it on Amazon and I received it very quick. This was great because the subject matter is an interest to me. The quality of the DVD is not the best, but it is still pretty decent. This DVD covers the life of Billy Meiers who claims to be a UFO contactee. This case is very interesting due to all of the photos and film he has collected which backs up his claims. There are probably as many skeptics as there are believers on this case, so you should make your own decision about the case. Some of what he says is everyday common stuff and some other stuff is one of a kind and I have never seen anything like it. For the price, you will be entertained to an impressive level. I was almost sitting on the edge of my seat just listening to this story. I recommend this to anyone who hasn't heard about this case or even hasn't heard the whole story about this case. I will probably watch it again with friends and family, unless they ask to borrow it. Either way, whether you are a skeptic or a believer, you should take a look at this case. These photos, films and other evidence are all from a farmer with only one arm and years before any type of photo shop or video effects software was even produced. This was even before the home computer was conceived. Great stuff!",1287792000,15,1357,4.203065134099617
3936596,3,B002IJQ352,"This DVD, The Billy Meier Story, is a retitled/repackaged version of the film, The Silent Revolution of Truth. As that, it's a GREAT movie, and I would have given it 5 stars. But I give it 3, because I already had The Silent Revolution of Truth, which I like a lot, and then I bought this anxious for some different film, and when I put it in, it was the same film I already had. So, I was disappointed. If it had been made it known on the listing, this was The Silent Revolution of Truth, I would not have bought this, because I already had this movie under it's original title. BUT, for those that do not have this, I would give it a good rating and recommendation. This is an offically licensed DVD, so don't be concered about that. The DVD is well made, though my curse is discs coming loose in the mail, which happened(oh why did they invent DVD cases like they did?). But this is a great movie, with great info, it shows many pictures, as well as film, and much footage with Billy Meier, and his history, and also speaks of the controversy of his claims. Highly recommended for UFO enthusiasts, but note, this is the exact movie as The Silent Revolution of Truth, if you happen to already own that, like I did.",1286236800,26,1216,4.291304347826087
3936597,4,B002IJQ352,"You know that beer commercial with ""the most interesting man in the world?""  Well, Billy Meier is the real thing.

He's the source of hundreds of photos and videos of UFOs, taken around the world.  He claims to have had contact with extraterrestrials since 1942.  In fact, some of his photos are claimed to have been taken from UFOs.

A veteran of the French Foreign Legion, now missing an arm, with a 2-foot-long beard, Billy Meier calmly explains the most fantastic things in his native German (he's Swiss.)  Most interesting is the relationship between religion and the extraterrestrials.  Also fascinating is an interview with Meier's son, who grew up as the son of the local ""nut-case.""

Whether you believe in alien visitation or not, this DVD is a great introduction to a fascinating character.",1276214400,12,801,4.925373134328358
3936598,3,B002IJQ352,"I had purchased this dvd as a gift for my wife. Price was right, delivered very quickly,,but,,, upon opening case, she found that the disc itself had come loose from the locking mechanism holding it into the case. There are many scratches on the surface of the disc. Fortunately those scratches don't seem to be affecting the playing quality. We are both advid Billy Meier fans and enjoyed the dvd. Although, since, we're such fans, we had alot of the material before. It is nice to have our(her) own copy to peruse at our leisure.

3936627,3,B002IJQ352,"Billy Meier's contacts with aliens from the Pleiades were big news about 30 years ago. Indeed, I heard about Meier and his alien woman Semjase already in junior high. A Swedish weekly magazine had published a sensational article on the case, complete with photos of Semjase. The case caused a tremendous amount of controversy in the United States, where Meier (a Swiss national) got some supporters. Then, interest in the Meier case died down, and today only a few hard-line nerds such as myself remember it. However, it seems that Meier and his small circle of supporters (called FIGU) are still going strong in Switzerland.

Of course, the Meier case is a transparent hoax. His films and photos of UFOs are laughable forgeries, and so are his prophecies. Meier's predictions about the collapse of the Soviet Union, two U.S. wars with Iraq and impending doom due to climate change and overpopulation were supposedly issued in 1958, but not published until 2005! His sensational new gospel, ""The Talmud of Jmmanuel"" is a modern apocrypha of the usual kind, with all the anachronisms and misunderstandings firmly in place (see my review of it elsewhere).

Meier claims to have met Saddam Hussein, Emperor Haile Selassie of Ethiopia, King Farouk of Egypt and Mahatma Gandhi already as a young man. He also claims to have been employed as a professional hitman by several Mideast governments, code named ""The Shadow"". Supposedly, he served in the Foreign Legion and successfully deserted from it, in the middle of the Sahara desert. I'm not sure if anyone has bothered to check Meier's stories, or check if he even understands Turkish, Arabic, Amharic and other ""shadowy"" languages. Considering the general track record of this man, I'd say he made it all up!

This documentary is pro-Meier and brought to us by Michael Horn, Meier's officially recognized representative in the US (recognized by Meier, that is). I don't deny that the film is well-produced and interesting. Weirdly, even a token sceptic have been featured, who indirectly accuses Meier of being schizoid or having a delusional disorder (a more diplomatic way to suggest that Billy is a pathological liar). Most of the other interviewees are Meier fans or supporters, including one man who claims that the aliens gave him an apple which he has preserved in alcohol to this very day (he does indeed show the bottle with the apple in it). This is the most comic part of the entire show, with the old man complaining about most people not taking his apple story seriously...

On a more disturbing note, Horn calls for an armed One World Government to fight terrorism, and wants us to follow a man of principle and integrity whose identity is never specified (obviously the Messiah...or the Anti-Christ if you're a wee bit sceptical to Meierism). Coupled with the fact that Meier's bizarre new gospel is both anti-Semitic, Islamophobic and homophobic, I think it's obvious that we are dealing with some kind of proto-fascist sect.

Still, I'm involuntarily fascinated by Meier and his little band of followers. It's obvious that we are dealing with a contactee case. The Billy Meier story is part of the religious-spiritual undercurrent of the UFO phenomenon. It has obvious similarities with the Adamski case, including the hoaxed photos and the grand pretensions. The spiritual message of Meier (who looks like Moses complete with the big white beard) is a mutated version of Theosophy - again like Adamski. Note also the distorted Biblical or Egyptian names of Meier's principal alien contacts: Semjase, Semjasa, Sfath, Asket, etc. There is also the typically Gnostic role reversal, with evil Biblical characters being seen as good. Judas Iscariot supposedly wrote the true gospel of Jesus, the name of the fallen angel Semjaz turns up in the names of the benign aliens, etc.

More interestingly, perhaps, are the almost archetypal features of the story. Meier claims to have met aliens already as a kid. They became Meier's spirit-guides and groomed him for his future role as a prophet. The priest who regularly visited Meier's family was supposedly aware of the alien presence, and became a kind of additional mentor to the young man. This reminds me of many other cases: Whitley Strieber claims to have been educated by aliens already as a kid, Carl Gustav Jung claims to have met a spirit-guide named Philemon, both Jung and Rudolf Steiner had mysterious human masters alongside the spiritual ones, etc. Perhaps we are dealing with a ""real"" meme or psychological archetype, typical of charismatic prophet-figures?

The end-result of the Meier saga also strikes me as archetypal. Induced by the spirits, the ""prophet"" goes public, forms his little religion...and eventually all his prophecies turns out to be wrong, forcing him to fake evidence to stay afloat. Yes, Eduard Albert ""Billy"" Meier does fit the bill in more ways than one! Perhaps Meier did have genuine spiritual experiences, but if so, it's a tragedy that he warped them into a fascistic new religious movement based on make-believe.

I can't give this pro-Meierite propaganda flick five stars, but since ""The Billy Meier Story"" is fascinating in its own right, I nevertheless give it three - the OK rating. Of course, it's also available for free on Youtube.",1350777600,7,5289,5.0365714285714285
3936628,4,B002IJQ352,"The hero, Billy Meier, of this true account of how he was contacted decades, ago, by aliens living in the Pleides constellation. By the way, these aliens aren't the little gray things from the planet Zeta Reticuli who experiment on humans. These other aliens look just like human beings and, supposedly, are beings who helped create humans thousands of years, ago, along with the residents from the planet Nibiru and from whom we are also descended.  Billy was taken abroad spacecraft and flown around and once was taken to the main planet in the Pleides star cluster. One of the predictions his friends make are that there is a possibility the United States in the future could bomb North Korea, which is supported by China and Russia. If that happens, they would bomb five of our major cities, which would be the end of the USA. It's interesting that another psychic whose book I read several years, ago, I believe it was Sylvia Brown, predicted that a vice president in this century would send nuclear warheads to North Korea. This possibility is frightening. Could it be the next vice president of the United States? This is a fascinating video of actual sightings of UFO's and one anyone interested in UFO's should watch.

3936629,1,B002IJQ352,"Billy Meier is an elderly man with a long beard and only one arm who lives in Switzerland.
He has made a lifetime career out of claiming to be in constant contact with aliens from the Pleides star system.  He has written around forty books, and he proudly claims each had three thousand copies published.

He has numerous photographs dating back to the 1950s of UFOs.  They are very sharp photos, clear and in surprising detail.  For me these were the most obvious clue that this man was one of the biggest liars I have ever heard.  His first UFO video shows a little UFO shaped thing which looks like it is very obviously dangling from a string.  It isn't hovering or flying, it's ""penduluming"" to coin a new word.  Around and around it tilts from it's center axis, seeming to sway back and forth in the air current.  Some of the other photos are more convincing, but since they were taken by this particular person, they can't be believed.

The only amazing thing about this entire film is this.  How can one elderly man keep up the constant stream of lies?
How can he blithely keep yammering on and on answering all the questions about his UFO friends and expound on philosophical subjects and tell all about what we are put on earth for and what our souls are doing here.  Reincarnation and abortion are explained as if he has the answers from much higher authorities, namely the aliens he chats with.

And, how can he get a few dozen other people to support him and claim that he does indeed chat with visitors from other star systems, and support his claim that his videos and photos of UFOs are genuine.  Even his first amaturish attempt at the UFO hoax, the one dangling from a string, is marveled over by a so called expert as being the real thing.  A five year old could see it was suspended from a string.

He claims that he is the only person on earth that the alien visitors allow to see their spaceships up close.  He was especially chosen, at the age of five, to bring the messages of the aliens to the world.  But later in the film he gives the year when the aliens first contacted him, which was when he was thirty six.  If you are going to tell giant lies on film it helps if your memory isn't slipping.  Maybe they chose him at age five but didn't contact him until he was thirty six?

Much to the credit of the makers of the documentary, a psychologist was shown explaining how sometimes if a person has had an abusive childhood, he can invent a way to make himself feel more important.  The implication is that this is what Mr. Meier has done.

This was fascinating on one level, that of a con artist's arrogance that he is being believed.  My guess is that this man has some sort of psychological disorder.  Don't waste your time on this.",1344556800,,2760,4.3772102161100195

8370966,1,B002IJQ352,"This documentary presents only a fraction of the many ' Bizarre ' claims of Billy Meier made over a decade. His promoter/producer in USA, Michael Horn, has the nerve to even argue for some of his ' Outrageous ' UFO photos citing so-called expert opinions, including his infamous ' Wedding Cake ' UFO that had been found to resemble certain barrel lid, bookcase pins, and Xmas ornamental balls assembled together !

Details of these photos and a lot more were debunked by many, such as ' billymeierufocase.com ' :
1)  One of his Dinosaur photos was shot from an illustration in a 1972 book titled "" Life Before Man "".
2)  His ET humanoid photos Asket & Nera were taken from a Dean Martin TV show in the early 70s.
3)  His Fireship photo was created by a traditional feat of swinging around a burning steel wool .................

This film just omitted all these exposed hoaxes as well as the testimonies of his wife in 1997, who divorced him after realizing some of these
frauds of her husband.

When his hoaxes were increasingly publicized since the 90s, Meier simply retracted some of what he had long claimed and blamed some
secret agents for the fabrication, while the film showed him shamelessly preaching that "" human being is solely responsible for each and everything he thinks, does, feels, and undertakes ...... "" ( at about 1 hr 12 min ) !  Even today Meier's so-called ' spiritual ' teachings are still
continued by some of his supporters, much like those of the phony Evangelists and sinister/Satanic Popes throughout history ( including the current Pope Francis ).

Many profoundly serious questions remain concerning what darkly twisted powers and motives were behind Billy Meier and his kind, and their blind believers or promoters also. Who are the genuine Contactees of truly benevolent Beings from other Worlds / Dimensions ? There are many more serious sources to examine these matters, such as those of Harvard M.D. John Mack ( killed by a drunk driver in London, 2004 ), or the colossal "" Matrix "" series (I to VI, 1988 - 2007+) by Leading Edge Research Group, edited by Val Valerian ( mostly free online, with some misinformation/disinformation also  ).",1490140800,,2176,4.781333333333333
