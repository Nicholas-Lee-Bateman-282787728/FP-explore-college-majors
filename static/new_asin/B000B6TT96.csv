8082711,5,B000B6TT96,"Each story in Max Lucado's Hermie and Friends series is fantastic!  We are big Hermie fans in our house.  Each episode contains a kid-sized life-lesson with Biblical truths throughout.  The animation is superb, voice talent amazing, and the story-line engaging.

In this episode, you meet Stanley, whose greatest fear is that others will not like him.  The other bugs want to like Stanley, but because of his stink, it is difficult for them to overlook the smell and really get to know him.  The storyline also touches on doubt and being able to ask God the ""why"" questions of life.  Every Hermie and Friends story opens up a dialogue for children and their parents.  In the end, the bugs discover why Stanley stinks and that God made him that way for a very important reason.",1172361600,2,776,4.696296296296296
8082712,5,B000B6TT96,"I actually haven't seen the movie but having Don Knotts be a part of it INSTANTLY makes it a must-buy.  Don Knotts has a really good voice and probably fits in perfectly with the storyline in the film.  I must be on the lookout for it.  Besides, any story with a stink bug as a main character HAS to be good!",1154736000,,308,4.016393442622951
8082713,5,B000B6TT96,"A wonderful new video from Hermie!  The Hermie universe always introduces silly and fun new characters to the garden, such as the stinky Stanley and Skeeter, the Mosquito with no sense of direction.  Judge Reinhold provides a cute and endearing voice as Stanley.  This story does a great job of helping us to accept those who are different than us and finding what qualities they have that are good.  This is also one of Don Knotts' final acting efforts so it's worth it to enjoy him for one of the last times.",1154304000,3,510,4.510869565217392
