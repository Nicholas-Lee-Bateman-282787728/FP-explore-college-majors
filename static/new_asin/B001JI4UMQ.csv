3658002,5,B001JI4UMQ,"My children grew up viewing Shelley Duvall's Bedtime Stories and now my 2 year old grand daughter has watched them, also, and loves them.  I am so glad that they are available for her because they are wholesome, refreshing, and provide the quality of entertainment that is difficult to find for young children.  Thank you Shelley Duvall and friends.",1258675200,,349,4.898305084745763
3658003,5,B001JI4UMQ,"Sad, but true, there was heretofore no information about the actual contents of this DVD set.  It goes as follows:

Disc One: 6 Stories-75 minutes------
Elbert's Bad Word by Ringo Starr / Weird Parents by Bette Midler / Little Toot and the Loch Ness Monster by Rick Moranis / Choo Choo by Bonnie Raitt / Elizabeth and Larry by Jean Stapleton / Bill and Pete by Dudley Moore

Disc Two: 7 Stories-75 minutes------
Blumpoe The Grumpo Meets Arnold the Cat by John Candy / Millions of Cats by James Earl Jones / There's a Nightmare in My Closet by Michael J. Fox / There's an Alligator Under My Bed by Christian Slater / There's Something in My Attic by Sissy Spacek / Patrick's Dinosaurs by Martin Short / What Happened to Patrick's Dinosaurs by Martin Short

Disc Three: 6 Stories-78minutes------
Tugford Wanted To Be Bad by Steve Martin / Little Penguin's Tale by Candice Bergen / Moe The Dog in Tropical Paradise by Richard Dreyfuss / Amos, The Story Of An Old Dog and His Couch by Morgan Freeman / My New Neighbors by Billy Crystal / Rotten Island by Charles Grodin

Disc Four: 7 Stories-105 minutes------
The Little Rabbit Who Wanted Red Wings by Shelley Duvall / Katy No-Pockets by Mary Steenburgen / Bootsie Barker Bites by Rhea Perlman / Ruby The Copycat by Shelley Long / Aunt Ippy's Museum of Junk by Kathy Bates / Uncle Wizzmo's New Used Car by Ed Begley, Jr. / The Christmas Witch by Angela Lansbury

Naturally these are read by, not authored by the various actors and actresses.  The books chosen are not all time-worn children's classics, many are much more recent than Millions of Cats.  I probably read only a fifth of these titles to my own children, which were read to constantly.  However, parents and children love these DVD stories.  Parents will get a kick out hearing John Candy, Steve Martin, and Angela Lansbury tell the stories.  It is far preferable to read to a child on your lap for many reasons.  But, these renditions are good for the times when someone has to get dinner on the table or nurse a sick cat.  It will heighten the child's appreciation of books in general and, I believe, help encourage many to become good readers.",1249776000,34,2155,4.580729166666667
3658004,5,B001JI4UMQ,Shelly Duvall's bedtime stories is a wonderful collection of children's literature and the graphics are in keeping with the illustrations in the books.  My granddaughter is thrilled with them.  What a wonderful way to introduce children to these classic tales.,1247011200,9,260,5.475
3658005,5,B001JI4UMQ,"We use to let our 3yr. old grandson watch a couple of Shelley Duvall Bedtime Stories when they were ON DEMAND on cable, before he went to bed. Then they took them off. So when I discovered them on amazon, I was excited. They are fabulous. Our grandson loves them. They have become a bedtme ritual. I would very highly recommend these to anyone.",1241913600,5,344,4.390625
3658006,5,B001JI4UMQ,"My grandchildren have loved each and every Shelley Duvall's Bedtime Story on VHS tapes, and now we can get them all in one DVD collection!  Terrific news!  They love Little Toot and the Loch Ness Monster, Elizabeth & Larry, Weird Parents, Millions of Cats, Choo Choo, There's an Alligator Under My Bed, Tugford Wanted to Be Bad, Bootsie Barker Bites, and many, many more.  I always felt confident letting them watch these animated books (with Shelley Duvall's delightful introductions and the celebrities reading them so well) because it was as if I were sitting there reading good literature to them.  These are the best DVDs ever and they hold the attention of 2-7 year olds!",1239148800,11,677,4.860869565217391

I definitely recommend them!",1235347200,6,167,4.533333333333333

8312939,5,B001JI4UMQ,Wonderful as I had expected. I obtained the dvds for my great grandchildren and wished they have very good movies without so much violence and bad language.  This specific dvd along with all the others I found were perfect.  Thank you.,1417651200,2,235,4.7073170731707314
8312940,5,B001JI4UMQ,"My son watched these when he was young, I can't wait to share with my niece and nephew! It was such fun to have the book to go along with the video for him to 'read'",1372032000,,165,3.611111111111111
8312941,5,B001JI4UMQ,"I have 2.5-year-old twin boys. They don't get to watch a lot of TV besides PBS stuff, but when we saw this at a friend's house, they were riveted. My friend said it was one of her son's favorites, and since they were such sweet, simple stories (no loud crashes, flashes, etc.), I decided to get it for our house. Unfortunately, because it's old, it's hard to find. I ordered mine used through Amazon. It was advertised ""like new,"" but it did come with the wrong case for one of the DVDs. Not a HUGE issue, just a little annoying. And not enough to go through the hassle of returning it for - especially since it's hard to find.

My husband and I find Shelley Duvall a little annoying, but our sons seem to love her. Maybe because she IS so different and silly. Anyway, I strongly recommend this set if you want to offer your children simple stories on DVD. I don't think you'll be disappointed.",1335225600,,894,4.3532934131736525
8312942,5,B001JI4UMQ,"My son was thrilled when this arrived.  He wanted this and could not find it in town.  great service , no hassles.  You made a customer for life.",1320192000,,145,4.107142857142857
8312943,5,B001JI4UMQ,"My grandson loves it. He had watched several of the stories on ""On Demand"" with Comcast and was upset when they were no longer available. Delivery was also great. Thanks

8312944,5,B001JI4UMQ,"I watched these On Demand with my son and when they weren't on anymore I bought this set. He loves them and we can watch them over and over again, just like his favorite books! Highly recommended!",1288828800,3,196,4.324324324324325
