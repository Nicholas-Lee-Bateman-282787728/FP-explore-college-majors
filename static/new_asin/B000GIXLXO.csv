2614432,5,B000GIXLXO,"My boyfriend and I are huge Brett Favre fans and I got him this for Christmas and we both loved it. It was similar to the DVD in his book, but it did have some things that were different. It was well documented and had humor with it also. Billy Bob Thorton did a great job with it. I'd suggest this to anyone who is a Packer or Favre fan.",1169856000,11,338,3.842857142857143

2614471,5,B000GIXLXO,"I have not recieved this DVD yet, but I look forward with eager anticipation to viewing Brett Favre in all his boyish  energy & enthusiasm. I remember that heart tugging game Brett played in honor of his father who had just died hours before the game. I cried & cheered Brett on. One of the greatest games Brett Favre ever played. I miss Brett Favre & wish he would become a NFL commentator for the love of all his fans. A great quarterback &  a great athlete.",1389398400,,460,4.275862068965517

2614474,5,B000GIXLXO,"This DVD was a great overview of Brett Favre's life before and during his play for the Packers. It covered a lot of personal details that I didn't know, nor did the 2 family members I watched it with. It is well worth a look, and value priced as well.",1264809600,,251,4.04
2614475,5,B000GIXLXO,"I have watched this repeatedly and think this dvd is very well made. It is liking watching poetry in motion when Brett throws, and you will get tears in your eyes watching the segment on when his father passed away and how he played that game, perhaps his best ever. Why is Brett Favre so adored? He may be known as the ""gunslinger"" but he is also all heart and plays football with the passion and enthusiasm his fans admire him for. I think that Billy Bob Thorton narrating this dvd was the icing on the cake. My brother paid $20 for this dvd at a local store and I got it on Amazon for $5 sale.",1231027200,,596,4.102564102564102
2614476,3,B000GIXLXO,"We love Farve, but my cheesehead hubby, born and bred, gagged on the ""greatness"" of Brett. Good for the collection.",1223510400,,115,4.8
2614477,5,B000GIXLXO,This is a great dvd to remember all the great things about Brett.  I rate this highly and Amazon shipped it so fast and better than other stores online.,1222128000,,152,4.241379310344827
2614478,5,B000GIXLXO,My husband is a huge Favre fan & I can't help but like the guy too (even though I am a die hard Steelers fan).  We really liked the video & were not disappointed.  We are hoping that there is an updated version in the future.  The last few years are missing.,1214697600,,258,3.923076923076923
2614479,5,B000GIXLXO,The DVD is really great. I enjoyed it tremendously. Brett Favre is a great person on and off the football field. The DVD did a good job of portraying him.,1208736000,,154,4.166666666666667
2614480,5,B000GIXLXO,"Even as a committed Bear fan I still have to say this was a very enjoyable DVD. It is well worth having and you will not be sorry you bought it.
Favre has to be one of the best to have played the game and he will be missed. Buy it. You will play it over and over again.",1208563200,,269,3.5762711864406778
2614481,5,B000GIXLXO,Outstanding and inspirational DVD! Shows how someone can take on multiple challenges in life and keep pushing forward.,1208304000,,118,5.611111111111111
2614482,5,B000GIXLXO,"This NFL bio of Brett Favre was aired on one of our local TV stations the night that Brett announced his retirement.  I missed it, but my husband saw it and loved it.  Thankfully we were able to buy the DVD.  It's an inspiring and heart-warming tribute to the Packers' great #4.  We loved seeing it and bought several copies for others who share our respect and affection for this terrific athlete and man. Packer football won't be the same without Brett, that's for sure!",1207958400,,472,4.517647058823529
2614488,5,B000GIXLXO,"I watched this DVD both before and after Brett Favre announced his retirement from football. The first viewing left me feeling happy and proud that he is a Green Bay Packer; the second, sad because he'll never wear that  green and gold uniform again. BF is truly one of a kind, and this NFL production does him proud. Note to Brett: You are already sorely missed.",1207440000,,363,4.5
2614489,4,B000GIXLXO,"'Favre 4 Ever' is a great look at one of the most storied quarterbacks in NFL history, Brett Favre.  Examining his career from the start up until the 2006 season, it seems like a version 2.0 of this DVD will be required to show him breaking the all-time passing yards and touchdowns records, along with his incredible MVP-type 2007 season.  If you are a Brett Favre and/or Packers fan and enjoy watching NFL documentaries, you will no doubt enjoy this solid release!!

2614494,5,B000GIXLXO,"A great documentary type movie.  If you love Brett Favre, you have to have this movie.  It has some cool footage from high school and college that you never see anywhere else.  It also has some stories that you've never heard before.  It's a great movie and during the part about Brett and his dad, wow, it made me want to cry!  It pumped me up for the game this weekend, that's for sure.  If you are a hardcore Packer fan, this is a must for sure.  I'm glad I got it.",1192147200,3,468,4.021739130434782

2614496,5,B000GIXLXO,"This DVD was released on my 30th birthday, and what a gift it was. Thanks, Brett! Such a wonderful documentary about an amazing football player. What made it even more perfect was that Billy Bob Thornton narrated it. Of course Brett's story has to be told with a twang! There's no other team out there like the Packers, and we (yes, I refer to Packer fans and pretty much the entire state of Wisconsin as ""we"") are so blessed to have him as our quarterback. May he play for 4Ever! GO PACK GO!",1184198400,7,492,4.301075268817204
