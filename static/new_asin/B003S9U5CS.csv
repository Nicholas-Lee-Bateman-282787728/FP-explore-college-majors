8404125,4,B003S9U5CS,"Excellent Concert, a variety of good music, the band is awesome and the Bluray includes a nice resahal video before concert with a view of people waiting for in and Miku's projection test.

Concert features excellent Audio with an Option of HI-FIStereo Sound PCM and Dolby Digital 5.1 Channels.

The Bad and the reason i give 4 of 5 stars is the Bluray doesn't have Pop-up Menu feature and when you want to change tracks you must stop the playback and go to the Menu, that is very annoying.

The another thing is the character projection look some pixeled, i can imagine that will be improve in the next Vocaloid concerts",1495411200,,621,4.576576576576577
8404126,5,B003S9U5CS,"One of the first and best Vocaloid concerts to date, in my top 3.  Lots of varied songs different from other concerts.  Great band performance, and  a crisp, clean, sound mix.  Well edited, lots of varied camera angles.  I had trouble getting the disk to start on my player, but once it started it played fine.  The special feature documentary on the concert production does not play properly on my disk player.  Could be an odd video format or other incompatibility with my machine.  My player is older than this disk release, but plays newer disks with no trouble, so it must be some kind of mastering problem.
Anyway, this concert is a worthy addition to a devoted Vocaloid fan's collection.",1429574400,3,694,4.677685950413223
