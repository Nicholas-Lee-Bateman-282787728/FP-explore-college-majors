2069343,5,B000296E7W,"Etre et Avoir/ To Be and to Have is a masterpiece of documentary filmmaking. I watched this with my wife and we were both taken in by the story of the teacher in the twilight of his career using all his acquired skill and experience to shape these children. Not only teaching them to read and write, but also teaching them their personal worth and place in society. You'll laugh and cry. Any teacher or anyone planning on teaching should view this film.

I loved that there was no voice over commentary from the director, which allowed you get an unbiased view into the life of this little schoolhouse. Forget Michael Moore and his propaganda laced documentary, Nicolas Philbert isn't selling you any of his ideas, but you'll buy into the story line. The shots are beautiful and you'll wish grew up in small farming town in France. Absolutely Stunning. A must see. Thank you Nicolas Philbert.",1102204800,23,892,4.681528662420382
2069344,5,B000296E7W,"I chose this DVD before reading the reviews because I usually enjoy documentaries. My expectations were exceeded.

At first, as this quiet documentary meandered slowly from scene to scene, I wondered, ""When will we get to the point?"" Then I realized, this IS the point.  We're enjoying a slow-paced, leisurely experience, pacing the school's rhythm and the relaxed French country town.

We begin with a bitter winter day, first watching cows being herded home,then two tortoises in an empty room, then children coming on a school van. (The director's commentary explains that the cows and tortoises are metaphors for, respectively, school and the film.) And then we see scenes of Georges Lopez with the students, singly or in groups, never raising his voice, never showing annoyance, never crossing boundaries.  This is a man with a vocation, the kind we rarely see anymore.

Lopez isn't a modern teacher. He's strict: students stand every morning to greet him, say ""yes sir"" and perform lessons by memorization. When a very young child doesn't finish a drawing, he misses recess.

I don't know if it's the best pedagogy around. But what students learn goes way beyond math, French, drawing and cooking. They learn to work as a second family, respecting one another, obeying the rules.

Because the director chose a small school, we get to know each child a little and we see some parents. There's a hilarious scene where an older student grapples with math homework. His entire family -- parents, uncle, older brother -- come to help and end up becoming equally confused.

This is the kind of film I could watch many times, seeing new details and nuances each time.  The director allows scenes to unfold with no voiceover. We're forced to create our own interpretations, develop our own understanding.

I wish we could learn more about Lopez. Does he have a life beyond the classroom? How does he work with young children all day and remain so calm? In the one scene where he's interviewed, he visibly relaxes, remembering how he got into teaching. His father worked so hard, he says, he knew he wanted another life.  Perhaps the context of his childhood framed his expectations, leaving him remarkably free of burnout.

And I wondered about the socioeconomic status of the children. They all seem to come from working farms. One child is shown working -- driving a huge tractor-type machine confidently, feeding animals, mucking out stalls. But all seem well-dressed with good haircuts. The teacher seems to be driving an Audi.  Is this group especially privileged?

Finally, we need a sequel!  Does this kind of education prepare children for the real world, whatever that may be? Will they do well in middle school? Will the boys cease fighting and Nathalie, the quiet girl, become more comfortable with conversation?  That's the test of a good documentary: we're so involved that we want to learn more.",1099958400,10,2907,4.9628865979381445
2069345,5,B000296E7W,"Etre et Avoir documents the story of a rural French one-room school, where students from kindergarten to about 11 years old are taught by a devoted teacher who has taught at this schoolhouse for over 20 years.  We get a glimpse into the homelife of one or two of the students, and the documentary crew (who spent a year at the school) manage to capture some truly charming spontaneous moments.

I found it fascinating to watch the kids learning their numbers and French grammar.  I am reminded of that old joke about the American who went on vacation in France and was impressed at how educated the children there were: ""I heard children as young as two years old, speaking French!""

All first-year teachers could benefit from watching how the instructor deals with the children of different ages.  He is patient, but he demands respect.  He is stern when necessary but never cruel and the children love him, as it's clear he loves them.  What a wonderful true story.",1099785600,39,967,4.686390532544379
2069346,5,B000296E7W,"This documentary film is like the antidote to, or at least the cultural polar opposite of, the reelection of George Dubya Bush to the United States Presidency... A subtle, poignant look at the work done by one schoolteacher in one, small school in rural France.  Mssr. Lopez, who is about to retire in the next school year, teaches twelve children, ranging from 4 to 11 years of age, and he gives each one his full, loving attention, helping them explore and find their place in the world.  He's the dream teacher: parents who see this film will ache to have Lopez magically appear in their lives and have him take over their kid's education.  As the world around us becomes faster, meaner, more heedless of humanity, watching a film like this restores one's faith that rationality and compassion will still have a place in our future... And they will, as long as the world still has teachers like this in it.  Beautiful cinematography, as well.",1099612800,24,945,4.709090909090909

2069361,4,B000296E7W,"I bought this movie as an English-speaking French teacher hoping that it'd be a good one to show to my students. I may still show them, but as is, it'll be of limited value to them for a few reasons.
1: There are only English subtitles, not French. That's helpful for my FRN 1 students, but not so much for the upper levels. Either way they'd just be reading English the whole time, which doesn't provide the immersion I was hoping for.
2: Since this is a documentary and the microphone isn't always very close to the person speaking, the dialogue is a lot more difficult to hear, especially for someone who's not a native speaker. The music, background noises and other sounds are all loud and clear, but it was frustrating that the dialogue was so quiet no matter how high I turned up the volume.

If you're looking for something relaxing to watch that'll give you a view on life in rural French towns, this is it. I did enjoy watching it.",1394409600,2,941,4.408045977011494

Shortly after the start of the documentary, however, we were completely drawn into this teacher's world. There are things that people can learn through education or experience and then there are people who appear naturally gifted. George Lopez is a natural educator and his students (and their families) drew the jackpot when they landed in his classroom. For us the documentary proved to be an emotional experience thanks to the sheer magic with which George Lopez plies his trade and interacts with his students and their parents. Moreover, the documentary draws one back to a simpler life, a simple environment, where less is more. An absolutely wonderful documentary (which had some unfortunate consequences due to its success.

2069365,5,B000296E7W,"The premise of this documentary is simple: One teacher, 12 multi-aged students, which to most would sound like a day in hell, but George Lopez handles it not only with aplomb but the man practically earned sainthood right before my eyes. If you think that I'm spouting hyperbole, read some of the other reviews. If every teacher and father in this world were like Mr. Lopez, the world would be a much, much better place.

The documentary captures day-to-day experiences of the teacher, the students and their lives in a small farming village. Experiencing teaching on a small scale (with various grades in one room) was a new and interesting thing. Mr. Lopez was patient and caring to the point of bringing tears to my eyes more than a few times. And the children, like all kids, ranged the gamut from angels to problems, but all seemed equal somehow under his caring force. There was only one ""interview"" of Georges, and it was brief, but still gave an insight to his life's calling. The end of this film was captivataing, watching him struggle in front of the camera to hold back his emotions as the children left for holiday break. I can't say enough positive things about this man's character.

I don't think I've ever been so captivated and touched by a documentary. If you aren't at least emotionally moved in some way by this film, you might want to check and see if you have either a heart or a lump of coal where one should be.

Stylistically, the movie moves rather slowly, many ""postcard"" shots (camera not moving) of the local environs act as scene-changers but seemed to drag a bit long for my tastes. While the cinematography was good, a bit of panning - even slightly - might have helped move things along a bit better. Even so, the sound and action were produced well with no distortion or off volumes. The look and sound made you feel like you were there.

HIGHLY recommend. Five well-deserved stars.",1386547200,,1917,4.629411764705883

I would encourage any teacher who has become demotivated to see this film to recover a sense of mission and importance.

Every parent, grandparent, teacher and child counselor should watch this film and inform themselves of the immense potential that can be cultivated and extracted from our children through patience, empathy and by listening and hearing, by acknowledging their worth and allowing them their voices.

Thank you Nicolas Philibert, thank you for your sensitivity, for your insight, for the lessons, for your tasteful way of capturing and conveying to us the value and importance of our greatest gifts and responsibility - our children - and how our behaviour towards them and in general, shapes them and their future.

2069378,4,B000296E7W,"This oddly named, Frederick Wiseman style documentary does a fine job of showing the daily life of a teacher and his students in a rural French school, with a few glimpses of their parents. M. Lopez is a dedicated teacher who rather masterfully manages the 13 students in his one-room school, while displaying no particular brilliance at doing more than keeping them orderly and occupied at not-so-interesting tasks. About to retire, after 35 years in the profession, M. Lopez may represent to conservative French audiences the value of ""old-school"" teaching methods, which produce a kind of regimented acquiescence in the presence of authority. The lack of restlessness among his young charges is remarkable, as is their frequent reticence, and one begins to wonder how much their behavior is influenced by the presence of a camera crew.

Having spent my own early years in a 2-room country school, I found it all vaguely familiar and somewhat unsettling, as these students seemed poorly prepared for the modern world. Meanwhile, the librarian at the middle school where they take a field day talks of all the books on the shelves, but there is not a single computer in view anywhere. The students in M. Lopez' school, especially the younger ones, are endearing and sometimes full of life - especially when they are outside of the classroom - but the quietude of the older ones is disturbing. Only one shows a spark of resistance - and is scolded for his ""attitude"" - and he seems likely to grow up a farmer like his parents who run a dairy, where education seems to be and have a low priority. In one scene we see the boy, maybe 10 years old, adroitly operating a tractor, though he's hardly big enough for his feet to reach the foot pedals.

As a documentary filmmaker, director Philibert captures much with his camera and edits it all together in a way that seems to catch life as it is lived - at the pace of life itself, often slow. Teachers (as some have already noted here) may well have reservations about it all. The DVD includes an informative interview with the director.",1230422400,,2083,4.751381215469613
2069379,4,B000296E7W,"""To Be and to Have"" is a somewhat unusual documentary, as it has no narration, very few interviews, and no profound message.  Instead, we see the everyday events in a one-room rural French elementary school.  The lone teacher, Monsieur Lopez, oversees all the educational activities of the children (about 12 in total from ages 4 to 12 years), which vary from French dictation to making crepes to a field trip to the bucolic countryside.  He also lives above the school.  The class is his entire life, and he's obviously totally dedicated to the students.

The cameras follow this class over the course of a year, which is also the second to last year of Monsieur Lopez's 35 years of teaching.  Nothing earth-shattering happens - just kids being kids.  The film focuses more on some students than others of course, particularly young JoJo who has difficulty paying attention.  Although JoJo often takes up much of his time, Monsieur Lopez doesn't seem to mind, and he'll take extra time in the library to quiz JoJo on his counting and joke around with him as well.  If only all classrooms allowed this kind of one-on-one interaction!  Some of the other interesting students include withdrawn Nathalie, bickering Julien and Olivier, know-it-all Marie, and ghost-fearing Axel.  A few of the students get little coverage, which made me a little sad, but I suspect that they get their fair share of attention in this warm, loving classroom.

Director Nicholas Philibert has done a superb job of filming this documentary.  The look of it is unlike any other I've seen.  After watching about 20 minutes, I questioned whether I had misread that it was a documentary, as it was so cinematic.  I think many teachers will love this documentary, although some may find it too far removed from their experiences in crowded classrooms.  Also, one shouldn't view this documentary as a lesson in how to teach - Monsieur Lopez's teaching style seems effective but is clearly not meant for everyone.  Non-teachers who like kids will also greatly enjoy this one-of-a-kind film.",1227916800,2,2059,4.938953488372093

This film is an absolute masterpiece!  There is such depth and affirmation to the teacher and to all those who appear in the film.  It is a common theme - striving to reach underserved or overlooked children - to light the fire of wanting to learn and finding the bright potential in each one. George Lopez is a remarkably adept teacher who doesn't need the latest gadgets to create lessons that connect with each child. Patience, courtesy, a master guide's knowledge of the steps necessary for understanding are his tools, and he is a master craftsman.  It is one human really reaching out and touching the heart of another in ways that will change lives, ways that lift the very spirit of each child. How very many seeds he has sown! What marvels will they reap? What a gift this teacher and all who strive like him are to every student and community!  It reminds you what a difference personal dedication and an inspired noble soul can make in a world all to fascinated by technology and temporal glittery things. Spoken words and questions. Handwritten lessons. Yet they are so profound. This is what education and the vocation of teaching should return to - what we desperately need to hold on to lest we lose our very humanity.",1216944000,3,1385,5.110619469026549

All the way through I was wondering when the penny would drop and I would see what everyone was raving about. That never happened. And I bought this turkey. Oh well. Maybe someone will read this and won't get caught out like I was.

Anyone with a video camera could produce identical results by going to any school on the planet tomorrow. Kids, sitting around, learning. Wow.",1196640000,5,671,4.275590551181103
2069384,1,B000296E7W,"I came to this film excited by the reviews I had read.  I thought I would get it for my adult child who is thinking about getting into teaching.  As a former elementary teacher who has long been interested in best practices in teaching and learning, I couldn't wait to see what this extraordinary teacher would show me about working effectively with children.  To say I was disappointed is an understatement.  This teacher does not listen to his children. He talks and talks.  He asks them if they want to say something and then he continues talking before they can answer.

He does not inspire love of learning in them.  He gives them boring work to do and then asks other kids to correct them when they don't give him the exact answer he is looking for.  The film liner says he teaches through encouragement but I found few examples during the film where he encourages a student rather than prompts them to give him the answer he is asking for.  When they can't recite exactly what he wants, he is quick to put them on the spot and have other students answer for them.

His students do not speak up.  When Jojo starts a fight and then gets the worst of it, Lopez assumes that the other boy was responsible.  He does not ask the other boy to tell his side of it.  The other boy is unable (in a short time--Lopez never gives his students very long to respond to his pedantic, adultish questions that must mystify his students)--to articulate that he responded to Jojo's push rather than caused the problem.  Instead he bullies the boy into apologizing to Jojo.

The lack of joy in the classroom is troubling.  Not once did I see a child's eyes light up in excitement about learning.  All learning seems to be rote.  The teacher has children one by one go to the board and write a seven.  What a waste of a child's time and potential to get excited by learning!  And the level of learning is quite low.  Kids the age of 10 are working on multiplying by zero (and sometimes getting the answers wrong!).  The level of reading displayed is low.  It's not clear he is teaching them to decode words or use context to figure out what a new word means.  He certainly isn't instilling in them a love of reading which must seem like a mechanical task to them by the way he teaches the subject.

And a word about the parents.  There is a painful, painful scene in which one of the older boys is being ""helped"" by his mother.  When he makes a mistake, she says (I am not kidding), ""Do you want a slap?""  At one point she does slap him when he makes a mistake.  Then the boy's father and uncle get involved and they argue about whether the boy's answer is correct.  The boy sits dumbfounded as they argue about a simple question (2 sixes = what?  Then add 2).  That a 10-year-old boy would be having trouble with this level of math problem is astounding.  That his parents can't agree on what the right answer is downright scary.

One scene epitomizes the teacher's ineffectual pedagogy.  He holds up a flash card of ""ami"" (masculine version of friend) and then ""amie"" (feminine version of friend).  When a child repeatedly says ""pal"" instead of ""friend,"" he becomes impatient with him and asks in a frustrated tone, ""Where did he get 'pal'?"" to the other students.  His entire teaching on screen is teacher centered to the point that he even reaches into a student's frying pan to straighten out his crepe.

The teacher's supposed facility helping his students with their emotional problems is a joke.  He tells Nathalie, who like many of the students, doesn't talk much, that he has told her teachers for next year that she has a problem speaking.  She seems a little confused by this--I have no understanding of why he felt he needed to share this information with her.  Then he asks her to say it was okay for him to tell this to her future teachers.  After he keeps at her, she finally nods her head.  He tries to recover by inviting her to come and visit him on Saturdays next year.  I doubt that Nathalie will want to do this but she dutifully nods her head, as she (and the other children) have learned that it's best to nod your head when he talks.

He builds up (sarcasm alert) one boy by saying that his test results were ""not entirely satisfactory"" but that nonetheless he would be passed on to the next level.  What a way to send a kid off to the next level.  He then tells the two oldest boys who were seen being ""talked to"" after a fight earlier in the film, that they were likely to be beaten up next year.  Great, they now have all summer to worry about new kids beating them up when they go to their new school in the fall.  He encourages each of them to get involved in the fight if either of them is picked on.  He tells one that he is strong as a bull (or some animal) so he shouldn't be afraid of getting into a fight.

Disappointed in the first minutes of the film, I thought I'd give the film more time because I was waiting for the payoff that the reviews had primed me for.  After I realized what kind of a teacher this was, I then decided to see it through to its end just to see how bad it would get.

When I read the fawning reviews of critics and others, I wonder that they would hold this teacher and this classroom up as an example of great teaching and learning.  I guess the up side for Americans who hate France because it refused to joining in invading Iraq is that with this kind of education, these future French adults will be no challenge to American dominion.",1188518400,11,5487,4.3431661750245825
2069385,5,B000296E7W,"This excellent documentary illustrates what is missing from contemporary American schools.  Viewers observe a school small enough that the teacher truly knows each of his students, and he knows their parents as well.  Exhibiting respect for the dignity and intelligence of each student, he commands respect in a natural way that allows for instructing his students not only in academics, but also in social rules and relationships.  In such a small school, the teacher is able to do for his students what adults are Supposed to do for children and youth, and that is to mentor them.

In addition, viewers observe students fighting while also supporting and forgiving each other.  One example is that of an older student who accepts the blame for pushing a younger student even though the younger student actually was the one to initiate the physical altercation.  After finding himself on the ground, the younger student is in tears because due to his fighting, he has unnecessarily fallen into the mud again after his teacher spent a good deal of time cleaning him up from the last time outside.  The little guy is distraught because he knows it will mean he will lose the privilege of an anticipated school outing.  Although this younger student was the instigator, rather than tell the teacher why he shoved the younger child, the older student allows the teacher to believe he was the one at fault.  In order to protect the younger student, not only did the older student allow the teacher to reprimand him, but also all of the students who witnessed the altercation protect the younger child by not volunteering to set the record straight.  Anyone who has spent much time on American playgrounds knows that is not the norm here.  However, in a school like the one in this documentary, such behavior among children is common because in small, more intimate environments students are able to bond with each other as a true community. No one can be an outsider because the community is just too small for anyone to be invisible or persecuted.  Instead, despite inevitable personality conflicts, in small schools with their accompanying close teacher-student relationships and guidance, students learn to accept each other and help each other

While considering what our own schools used to be like, before schools with 600-plus students at the elementary level and 1500-2500 students in middle and high schools, compare the actual relationship this teacher has with his students to the lack of personal relationships our students (especially after fifth grade) have with their teachers.  It is such relationships with adult mentors personally invested in them that motivate children of All ages.  Remember, too, that our own schools (small, without modern technology, and before the ""school reforms"" of the last 35 years) once turned out the world's leading creative thinkers, scientists, and inventors,.  This documentary illustrates why it is that until Americans go back to providing learning environments like the one in this film, all of our efforts to improve ""outcomes"" for the millions of disengaged students will only end up failing large numbers of them, just as they do now.",1187136000,,3187,5.076628352490421

The wise, soft-spoken M. Lopez oversees a K-5 schoolhouse in the heart of the Auvergne for 90 hushed  minutes, I was transfixed by the simple grandeur of the setting, the faces of these lovely kids and the quiet power of their teacher. The film sweeps the audience away from the noise and ugliness of this world into a place in which hard work, simplicity and hope prevail.

The cinematography and Ravel-like score enrich the thoughtful sequence of events Nicholas Philbert captures during a single school year. He also takes us into the homes, farms and fields of student families. At times, it seems remarkable the film wasn't scripted -- but after my second viewing, I knew it could not have been.

It's also noteworthy to compare the methods of M Lopez with the mass-production approach our districts have often taken in U.S. schools. Despite the learning problems, coping deficits or personal trials of his kids, he never views their reactions to struggle as disorders. His only interest is to view children as whole people help them on their way.

Pure love and joy, which goes a long way toward explaining why he was a master teacher, and this otherwise slow-moving film is so powerful and even magic. We see the kids reading and writing, fighting and farming, baking, sledding and celebrating class birthdays. In my favorite scene, Lopez coaches little Jo Jo to discover that he can count to a hundred, a thousand, ten thousand, and even a billion or more. You see his little mind reeling with the unfolding realization that numbers never stop! For the most part the kids are oblivious to the camera.

2069392,1,B000296E7W,"I found this film simply irritating.

I can't think why it should be ""required viewing"" like some reviewers claim. Maybe for those who are into teaching, who absolutely LOVE kids and for those who do rural sociology (I must be forgetting some other trade).

But for most of us, it only shows how difficult it must be to teach VERY young kids. And how vital that role is. As Kim Anehall puts so well in Amazon: ""To Be and to Have offers some true insights on the job as teachers should be regarded as everyday heroes in the last line of defense in a developing society"".

I think that the director Philibert never ""scrapes below the surface"" of the teaching process itself, leaving us instead with plain empiria. And the ""lessons"" seems staked, like if Mr. Lopez would like to prove how good he is at teaching, and as a person. But, as a reviewer notes, the camera shows very clearly when the kids have learnt their lesson, and when they don't (which is most of the times).

The stark contrast of the ""conditons of life"" in France compared to any underdeveloped country is painful. The teacher drives a big Audi (!), the schools themselves are nice and lofty, and they all have all the necessary equipment. The kind of things people take for granted on the developed world. I'd love to have this system back in my country, Argentina. Specifically, in the ""conurbano bonaerense"", where teachers aren't paid for months, pupils go to school basically to have a meal their parents can't afford back home, and violence is the rule of the game.

I laughed with one American reviewer when he said that probaby JoJo would be medicated in the US...

If you want to know about different methods of education you could always watch for instance Kiarostami's ""Where Is the Friend's Home?"" to learn how the other half of the world lives.

The cinematography is very nice.

I agree with another Amazon reviewer Matt Curtin (Columbus, OH USA) on the Lopez'saga of suits: ""That he would later claim that he was due some additional compensation that was never part of the deal reminds me of his interaction with young JoJo (...) even our greatest teachers are still ultimately human, complete with their own weaknesses. Perhaps the final lesson is that even disappointment is a part of life"".

Same goes for the great Manohla Dargis on the LA Times: ""Apparently, the French are not so very different, after all"".",1161216000,4,2394,4.680952380952381

Briefly, this is one of the best documentaries you will see. You get to laugh, think, feel, and remember. This should be required viewing for every parent & teacher. Enjoy!",1154476800,5,195,4.735294117647059
2069394,5,B000296E7W,"The one-room schoolhouse is widely seen as a thing of the past, a relic that predates the wonders of a modern system of education. Yet thousands of these schools exist in rural France. Director Nicolas Philibert takes us into one, situated in a remote Auvergne farming community in his documentary film tre et avoir.

Starring in this documentary is teacher Georges Lopez whose patient yet firm hand guides his students--about a dozen in number, ranging from the age of four to eleven--through some of their most formative years.

If Lopez is the star, he is supported by a cast of young people who did an admirable job of being themselves. The youngest of the children struggles to concentrate on a task at hand and then discovers that when it's time to play he hasn't followed through on his end of the agreement made with the teacher. Then comes the lesson: if he had stayed on-task, he would be finished and now able to play, but as it is, he needs to keep at his work while the other children play because failing to finish isn't an option.

The older children, in or near their last year in primary school, find themselves struggling to find their places. When the boys fight, Lopez finds himself in the role of mediator, showing not only the nonsense of the physicality, but helping them to see how it came about and how it could have been avoided. Finally he helps them to see that their behavior will guide that of the younger children and he asks them to consider what sort of example they're setting. A girl seems desperately in search of her voice and a means of expression and she seems unable to conquer the numbers that make for the lesson in mathematics. We see Lopez talking to her mother and hear him state his own objective in working with her as he does: he just wants her to be happy.

Working for the children's happiness sounds perhaps clich&eacute; but as the film progresses, we find no difficulty believing it. We see him volunteer his time to continue to work with his student struggling with math and to communicate even after she goes off to middle school. We observe a conversation with one of the older boys whose father is ill, recovering at home from one surgery so that he may return to the hospital for another. The boy is clearly and understandably upset, but the school's quiet master patiently listens and helps him to keep his perspective: even pain is a part of life.

Observation of the man and his methods that have helped children not just to learn their numbers and grammar but to become whoever they can become is genuinely a joy. Thus the film takes on a bittersweet flavor as we learn that Lopez is close to retirement--and in fact must be retired by now. One only hopes that the next generation of teachers will live up to the example set before them. We're also given cause for reflection, how it is that we interact with children and what sort of influence we have over them.

I was saddened to discover during the course of writing this that Lopez has since sued director Philibert, claiming partial authorship of the work. Losing his original suit, he appealed, and lost again. One additional appeal is possible and as far as I can tell, no announcement has been made. That Lopez would make such a claim--no doubt in search of a portion of the proceeds of the film which has turned out to be a surprise commercial success--is deeply disappointing. Being a documentary, the film simply reports what the camera sees, and we presume that Lopez agreed to be part of a documentary. That he would later claim that he was due some additional compensation that was never part of the deal reminds me of his interaction with young JoJo, who failed to live up to his part of the deal to be able to go out and play with the rest of the children. Were someone failing to live up to an agreement there would be some cause for dispute but this civil action looks like it could be greed, wanting to negotiate a different deal after seeing how the project turned out. Perhaps I'm just too much of an enterprising American to identify with Lopez on this front: one would think that a far better course of action would have been for him to use the tremendous amount of free publicity to publish a book on methods for education, to lecture on the development of children, or to do anything that could be a lucrative second career launched by the global exposure offered by the film's success. The episode is perhaps valuable for reminding us that even our greatest teachers are still ultimately human, complete with their own weaknesses. Perhaps the final lesson is that even disappointment is a part of life.",1154304000,4,4641,4.578820697954272

It is so reminiscent of times past where children are in their purest form--interacting with one another in such an innocent way...untouched by our western society...it is hard to believe there is still such a place that exists.
The teacher, Mr. Lopez, is a person who clearly understands his place in the lives of these children.  And his love of teaching children is so evident through out this film.
This was an exreme joy to watch and yet a painful realization of how far our educational system has strayed.  I can only hope and pray that we can get back to the basics--of protecting our children, loving & nurturing them and teaching them the simple joys of life.

2069397,4,B000296E7W,"French pedagogy differs from American, so American viewers should not expect an American classroom with a French accent when they watch ""To Be and To Have"" (""Etre et Avoir"").  Despite the differences of style and language, however, the film is powerful because it taps into the reservoir of universal experience.

Adults sometimes idealize childhood.  Maybe they really did have perfect lives as youth, but more likely their memories are short.  ""To Be and To Have"" recaptures not just the innocence and sponteneity of childhood that we idealize, but also the uncertainty, the need to be accepted and understood, the need and sometimes difficulty of understanding, the influence of family, the importance of a wise and caring teacher or guide.

The children are positively endearing, and very individual.  Some are stars; others struggle.  George Lopez, the instructor, is soft-spoken and reaches his students' minds through their hearts as well as intellect.  One of the things that struck me early on in the film was how effectvely he reached through to his students with his quiet wisdom and steady hand at the tiller.

The quality of the cinematography and editing are also excellent and support the film beautifully.

2069399,5,B000296E7W,"To Be and to Have is a spontaneous documentary depicting the hard work a teacher continuously provides for his students in a rural part of France where mountains loom in the background.  The words 'hard work' are relative as it is manually considered light work while the hours and the emotional patience might be weary on the hardest of men.  In addition, very few teachers are recognized for the work they provide for an emerging generation that will eventually take over from the current generation.  Nonetheless, the teacher's satisfaction is provided through the success of those he teaches, as they will move away and in due time discover what secrets rest behind the mountains.

The teacher, Georges Lopez, teaches a combined elementary school where the student's age varies with the youngest at about four years old.  Despite the wide range of ages among the students Mr. Lopez succeeds in teaching them what is needed to advance academically.  The students learn how to draw and write proper letters and numbers and learn what diameter and radius mean.  One of the amusing moments in the film is when the younger students learn how to crack an egg and one student misses the bowl while cracking the egg to which Mr. Lopez simply says, ""It's ok.""  This displays how Mr. Lopez does not miss an opportunity for learning, as the child learns a lesson in how to deal with failure.  There is a serenity surrounding Mr. Lopez to which the students seem to respond well, which is implemented even when he is dealing with bullying and fighting.  It is easy to see that Mr. Lopez has a job that he loves, as he also mentions that he could not imagine having a different job.

The students are uncomplicated kids that prefer to play during recess and chat among one another.  However, the students show an immense respect for Mr. Lopez who keeps them in line and on task as he holds them accountable for their work or lack of work.  In one scene there is a student, Jojo, who has not finished his assignment as he wants to go out for recess, but Mr. Lopez keeps him inside and makes it clear that he must finish his assignment now and not later.  These students learn not only academic skills through Mr. Lopez, but also social skills through verbal communication along with work ethic.  These verbal skills are practiced and demonstrated when two students are being reprimanded after a fight, which Mr. Lopez verbally guides the two boys through.

It is pure joy to watch Mr. Lopez handle each and every situation in school, outside of school, and during recess as no situation is the same.  Films such as Stand and Deliver (1988), Dead Poets Society (1989), and Emperor's Club (2002) offers insights and the beauty of an enlightening education, but these films do not affect the audience in the way To Be and to Have does as the students truly display a sincere manner in which most children learn.  The difficulty a teacher faces in order to get and continue to maintain their attention focused on educational material can be monumental, but in the fiction films this is merely displayed through one situation and with a wink of the magic wand where all students sit in nice rows and pays attention.

Mr. Lopez should have had one more year of teaching when Nicolas Philibert finished shooting the film, which means he has entered retirement by now.  In 30-some years Mr. Lopez worked with numerous students as many other teacher have done before him and teachers will continue to do after his retirement.  The notion of all the hard work that teachers provide for children are seldom appreciated as many even think teachers are overpaid.  However, the audience should consider that without teachers there would not be a progressing civilization, as teachers encourage the young generations inquisitiveness and quests for knowledge, which are a fundamental piece of technological evolution.  In addition, teachers help foster social skills which are essential for society's well-being as people must try to get along whether they like or dislike one another.  Thus, To Be and to Have offers some true insights on the job as teachers should be regarded as everyday heroes in the last line of defense in a developing society.",1103328000,60,4224,4.810511756569848
