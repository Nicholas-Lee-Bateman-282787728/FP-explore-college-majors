8376954,5,B002PETMV2,"This DVD helps you understand the easy ways in which to prepare your foods without oils, cheeses or meats.  It is excellent!  In between cooking preparations, Dr. McDougall gives his input on issues such as heart disease, diabetes, arthritis, body odors, eyesight, hearing loss, and more.
Dr. McDougall's opinions are featured on the new documentary, ""Forks over Knives"".",1403827200,3,371,5.379310344827586
8376955,4,B002PETMV2,"This DVD and the other McDougall cooking demonstration DVD, Cooking Made Easy, have amazingly helpful cooking tips and demos. I like that each cooking demo deals with a nutritional lesson. In other words, you get the whys first, then the hows. The McDougalls complement each other very nicely in both videos. Mary is the cook, and John explains. Well done. I found both cooking demos equally helpful: the more I stick to the diet, the better it tastes, and the easier I find sticking to it. I highly recommend both McDougall Made Easy and McDougall made irresistible.",1367971200,3,567,4.855670103092783
8376956,3,B002PETMV2,"I bought this DVD intending to lend it out to friends and family as an overview of McDougall's valuable health and nutrition messages.

This DVD is decent, but far from a good example of his best DVD work.  Was sorely disappointed.  It's like ""McDougall Light"" ... just skims the surface of the most important issues related to weight loss and eating a plant based diet. And the ""skimming"" happens in a casual, fireside chat format:  Mcdougall muses aloud while Mary (McDougall) shows us how to cook.

Friendly, easy to digest but not very meaty.  Quite frustrating when you're interested in what McDougall's saying but you have to work your way through the cooking parts to find the educational info.

I've seen Mary's cooking demos on other DVDs and enjoyed them.  And I thoroughly enjoyed other McDougall videos (like McDougall Medicine, which is still outstanding even though several years old).

I bought this one thinking it would be the best of McDougall Medicine plus cooking demos.  The format serves neither one well.

Not recommended.",1312243200,8,1045,4.982658959537572
