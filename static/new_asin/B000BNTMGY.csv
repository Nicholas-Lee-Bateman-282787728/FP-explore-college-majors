8089466,5,B000BNTMGY,"Great movie..!!  Don Antonio Aguilar, Latin America's most respected charro, and La Madre de la musica Ranchera, Lola Beltran.  What a cast!!  And the music is awesome..  You hear the old classic songs done by many artists, but when you hear the original versions - there is just no comparison.  This is no exception.  The movie is funny, The music is wonderful and just to see Antonio Aguilar and Lola Beltran together is such a treat.  En Paz descanse ""El Charro de Mexico"", y ""La Reina de La Cancion Ranchera""",1212710400,,512,4.622222222222222
8089467,5,B000BNTMGY,It is so good to hear Antonio Aguilar and Lola Beltran sing the songs of Jose Alfredo Jimenez.  This movie especially is fun to watch as both actors challenge each other in put downs through songs and seemingly in a race for President of the municipality.  Great fun!,1184457600,,267,4.541666666666667
