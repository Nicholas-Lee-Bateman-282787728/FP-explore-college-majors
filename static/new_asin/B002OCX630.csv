3961053,5,B002OCX630,"For those not in the know, 'Dalziel and Pascoe' is a popular British television crime drama based on the Dalziel and Pascoe books by Reginald Hill. First broadcast in March 1996 in the UK, it is set in Yorkshire, and is about two completely different detectives - and how they always come together to solve the crime; no matter what gets between them.

In the first of the four episodes, 'On Beulah Height' a young girl is taken and it seems that it isn't the first time such a thing has occurred in that small village. And now the whole village believes a once convicted young child murderer is back for more. No longer Inspector Dalziel but Superintendent, who notes that his body is created so due to ""years of Tetleys and second helpings"", he grabs his crotch and scratches his way through the mystery! The ending is a double twist beauty to stay attune to it.

In 'Recalled to Life,' we begin in 1963 where we find two lovers on a riverbank; who get rudely disturbed. We then find out, via flashbacks and present day investigations that he was married and the house owner, and she was his servant. Primarily set in the second half of the episode in the modern day, some of the flashbacks and characters to whom they are meant to be today can get confusing, but stick with it. This one stars the always-brilliant Tom Bell as suspect #1 and Leslie Phillips (at the end), but this one is a real jigsaw puzzle to put together, for sure.

In 'Time to Go,' a night clubber is killed with a drug overdose and soon all the action takes place inside a nightclub - and all attention is focused on the young (sexually creepy) brother and sister who own it. Also starring another British great, Bernard Cribbens, the episode allows for Dalziel to crack another fine comment: ""He's a funny block. Good looking, but smells like a tart's brothel!"" We also get to meet Dalziel's first wife, and possibly his child too! As for who does some of the future killings in the story, well, they are kind of obvious in which direction they point, sadly.

In the final episode of season four, 'The British Grenadier,' the title refers to a British pub, and a landlord - the great Dennis Waterman, in a most negative, angry role quite like nothing that I've EVER seen him portray - who's gone over the edge. Basically, the whole episode is a hostage situation in the pub that Dalziel gets roped into - being that he and the landlords wife had had something many, many years back! And she's called him for support that very same morning. For his burdens Dalziel gets a nasty blow to the forehead, which he carries with him the entire episode, and come the end, takes two to the chest!!",1316131200,3,2663,4.4958677685950414
3961054,5,B002OCX630,"I along with thousands (millions?) of Daiziel and Pascoe Fans have long awaited the release of US Playable (Region 1) sets of Dalziel and Pascoe's adventures. This is set 4, along with sets 1,2,and 3 these represent what I believe were the only episodes shown on US TV (A&E or PBS). The Series went on for 12 seasons, most of which were not available in the US. There are more seasons available from a Dutch company, these are playable on a european or a non-regional DVD Player, Which are not expensive but who wants 2 DVD players?
  These first series keep well to the original novels. Reginald Hill is one of the pemier Detective Novelist of our time, Dalziel and Pascoe are not his only characters as most of you know. Unfortunately, In the later Episodes the Film Makers strayed away from the novels. I believe Ellie was elimnated by divorce, as I haven't watched all the later episodes, I do not know if there are further deviations from the novels. Still this is one of the finest detective series availible.
  That said, Dalziel and Pascoe are among some of the great pairings in Detective Mystery! This set No. 4 includes Ep. 12 - On Beulah Heights - Ep. 13 -Recalled To Life - Ep. 14 - Time To Go - Ep. 15 - The British Grenadier. These are what i believe to be the last episodes seen on US TV. Hopefully they will contiune to release the rest of the Series.",1308873600,26,1368,4.416666666666667
3961055,5,B002OCX630,"The D-P series are a treat for my wife and I to watch.
In this set,only the British Grenadier ep is somewhat weak.
As usual,Warren Clarke (Dalziel) impresses;he is clearly
the dominant figure throughout the series. Here,we see his
ex-wife for the first time;what a ""tongue"" on her! (until
the end when she mellows a bit).The photography is a bit
too dark-even in ""daylight"" scenes and the lack of English
subtitles (actors use English;subtitles are Dutch) cause
some minor difficulties. Overall this is a terrific set,
and we look forward to viewing the next series (#5)",1271376000,9,570,4.947916666666667
3961056,5,B002OCX630,"Dalziel and Pascoe is one of my favorite detective series. Dalziel is not your usual chief detective and his relationship with the very different Pascoe makes the shows much more interesting than your average mystery. The series ran from 1996 through 2007. A total of 47 episodes were made, some of which were shown in the U.S. many years ago.

I can't understand why neither the United States nor the UK is producing DVD's of all of these shows at this time. There have never been any U.S. releases to my knowledge. The UK released Series One and Two and then stopped. These DVD's are from The Netherlands which has released the first five series on DVD. The programs are in English with subtitles which can be turned off from the main menu. The disks are, however, REGION 2 PAL DISKS. You must have A REGION 2 OR REGION-FREE DVD PLAYER CAPABLE OF CONVERTING PAL SIGNAL TO NTSC. You can't play these on a standard U. S. DVD player.

The 4 episodes in this 4-Disk Boxed Set were originally shown in 1999 and are as follows:

3961100,5,B002OCX630,"Andy Dalziel is a man accustomed to being underestimated; those who don't recognize that this Detective Superintendent Inspector is a force of nature do so at their own risk. Under that tough exterior is a ferocious intelligence. This isn't the charming but murderous environs of Midsomer, or Inspector Morse's Oxford. No, this series features mysteries with the roughness of the rolling Yorkshire dales and Dalziel's formidable form. To quote the Fat Man, ""A man who can play the bagpipes shouldn't have trouble with this job."" Colin Buchanan convincingly contrasts as Detective Inspector Peter Pascoe, trying to cope with balancing work and life.

On Beulah Height: This is a melancholy, fine adaptation of Reginald Hill's mystery novel, with the landscape as another vivid character, one of the best episodes of the entire series. The quality of the narrative, cinematography, and music as excellent as a classic film. If only the Jack Russell could protect his young ward better; the story deftly weaves loss past and present, with the previous flooding of a village to create electric power. Thanks to writer Michael Chaplin, script editor Andrew Clifford, Daemion Barry for the music, Graham Frake for photography, and producer Nick Pitt. The improvement in production is so marked that this may be the best series to start with, so you know just how good this series can get; Nick Pitt excels. Thus far, Series 6's ""Truth and Consequences,"" and Series 7's ""Men's Sana,"" ""Sins of the Father,"" and ""For Love Nor Money"" attain the same level of quality.

Recalled to Life: MI5 agents and marital subterfuge gall Dalziel and Pascoe. Andy's reputation suffers a blow when he and his old supervisor are investigated for a case of long-ago wrongful imprisonment. Fine guest-actors add life to an improbable plot, but the book was convoluted as well; this enactment is an improvement.

Time to Go: Why do the brother and sister look so alike? Great casting? No: it's the great young actors Andrew-Lee Potts (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Primeval-Volume-1-Series-1-2/dp/B001D2WUGG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Primeval: Volume 1 (Series 1 & 2)</a>) and his real-life sister Sarah-Jane Potts doing a bang-up job as a rather frightening pair of siblings.

The British Grenadier: Post-traumatic stress disorder is explored when a kindly Andy visits an old flame, Stella Moon, and winds up as a hostage in a village pub. An armed siege results, with the Super pulling punches and shots, thus endangering more lives.

Look forward to Season Five, where in Episode Three, ""Foreign Bodies,"" a recovering (from his wounds) Dalziel is in amorous mode in a beautiful, massive Victorian hotel on the coast. Dracula-like, a body washes ashore in a coffin, a black dog roams the seaside resort, and the same actress who played a Midsomer psychiatrist (who spawned evil children) uses her ripe feminine whiles on our susceptible voluptuary, Andy. Bront fans may especially enjoy a mystery that includes their blustery Yorkshire landscape. Enjoy!

PS: For those of you who want more, Series 6 through Series 11/12 are available for Region 2. Series 6 and 7 are worth it, after that the show drastically declines in quality, as reviewers in the U.K. note.

3961104,5,B002OCX630,"Filmed in the late 1990s and sans ""high tech"" gadgetry, Season four (4) of Dalziel and Pascoe is really a very good British detective/mystery program that I enjoyed.  Dalziel and Pascoe remain as ""different as night and day"" but they are a darn good detective team solving some very dastardly ""murder mysteries"" very well with Dalziel unorthodox and seemly crude manner (he is really rather nice, perhaps a"" little rough around the edges"") and Pascoe's very suave, gentle and well-dressed methods of solving murder mysteries.  In this season, they certainly have become a very good team solving horrendous cases very well while, we, the viewing audience, get to ""see"" some of their personal lives.

The mysteries this season are very well written, directed and acted.  I was kept very alert trying to determine ""who done it"".  Be advised to keep your ""thinking caps"" tightly in place because the mysteries in Season Four (4) of this series requires them.  Yes there is the preverbal ""cliff hanger""--will one of the ""leads"" survive to solve more crimes?",1318982400,,1052,5.017241379310345

8375960,5,B002OCX630,"The screenplay faithfully reflects author Reginald Hills characters, and the acting is superb, in all four episodes recorded on these DVDs.  The dialogue is realistic, although it would help most American viewers to turn on subtitles, and to learn a little about the slang terminology used in the vicinity of Yorkshire.  Still, I had little trouble understanding what was taking place.  There are four episodes in Season 4.

The first episode is titled On Beulah Height.  This episode is every bit as good as the book by Reginald Hill, which I reviewed and awarded five stars.  The overarching theme of the story is a childrens book called Nina and the Nix, which is Rosie Pascoes favorite bedtime story.  The Nix is a scaly monster who kidnaps little girls, drags them into his underground lair, and eats them.

Fifteen years ago, when Dalziel was a still Detective Inspector, he was in charge of a police investigation into the apparent attack on a little girl on Beulah height, a hill overlooking an abandoned and now-flooded village in Yorkshire.  At that same time, another little girl went missing and was never found.  The suspect also disappeared, and everybody believed that he had fled to America.  When, fifteen years later, the alleged suspect is seen in the village, and when another little girl disappears, everybody believes that the murderer has returned to the area, and to his crimes.

In a parallel story line, the Pascoes daughter Rosie contracts meningitis and falls into a coma.  She dreams that she has been captured by the Nix, and she is waiting for her father to come and rescue her.  While Rosie lies in the hospital, the body of the recently-missing little girl is found in a small cave on Beulah Height, and the comparison to the lair of the Nix becomes clear.

All loose ends come together at the end of the story, which has a few surprises for viewers.  Even though I had previously read the book, I was still a little surprised at the ending.  While generally faithful to the novel, a few things have been left out of the TV episode, but that did not adversely affect the quality of the production.  This show is clearly deserving of the five stars I award it.

The second episode is titled Recalled to Life.  It is based on the novel by the same name written by Reginald Hill.  Beautifully performed by the cast, the story begins in 1963, when Dalziel was just a young rookie detective.  A woman is charged with the shotgun murder of her lovers wife and spends 35 years in prison for it.  She is released when her lawyer manages to convince a judge that her conviction was not safe, the British term for unjustified.  The husband and his two best friends are all members of the British Security Services, what Dalziel calls the Emmies  MI-5 and MI-6.  He refers to all members of the Security Services as funny buggers.  One of the three is a mole, but which one?  It is revealed at the end, but not before more victims are murdered.

The plot is convoluted, but paying careful attention will allow most viewers to follow it.  As always, I suggest the use of subtitles when viewing this series.  Pascoe is almost murdered in this episode, and he suffers a serious cut above his left eye.  Dalziel travels to London to find the now-released murderer, who has absconded with a gun.  There, an attempt is made to murder Dalziel, also.  It is only good fortune that saves both detectives.

I liked this episode, and would rate it four stars, the same rating I awarded the novel when I first read it.

The third episode, Time to Go, is a story about a pair of fraternal twins, a boy and a girl, who appear to be in their mid-twenties.  I have read no novel with this title that was written by Reginald Hill, and I could find no mention of it on the Internet.  The screen credits indicate that the story was written by David Ashton, and that it was based on characters created by Reginald Hill, but not on any particular one of his novels.

The twin boy was born three minutes before the girl, so they consider him to be her older brother.  Their names are Nicholas and Sophie Richmond.  Their parents were killed in a tragic auto accident twenty years earlier in which the two twins were the only survivors.  The parents had been drunk, after attending the fathers brother Henry Richmonds birthday party at his home.  Uncle Henry becomes the guardian of the children, raising the inseparable pair into adulthood.  Nicholas and Sophie come up with an idea for a dance club, and Uncle Henry, who owns a perfume manufacturing company, finances it.  The club is called Tribal Pulse, and it is tremendously successful.

A criminal low-life named Tony, along with his cohort Snake, who also manages the dance club, conspire to take over control of Tribal Pulse from the twins.  Illegal drugs are being sold in the club, and one of the dealers is Sophies current boyfriend, Zach.  Zach collapses from what is originally thought to be a drug overdose, but police later determine that he has been poisoned with cyanide.  Later, Snake is found smothered to death in the club, but there is a witness who tells the police that the murderer was Sophie.  Was it?  Could she do such a thing?

Police search Uncle Henrys perfume manufacturing plant and discover a side operation that manufactures Ecstacy, known as E by the young people.  Not long after, Zachs father is caught in a meeting with a criminal, and it is discovered that he was allowing his son to remove drugs from the pharmacy he owns so that they could be sold in the dance club.

The plot is complex, but not too difficult for the average American to follow.  I thought the story was quite good and, as always, the acting was outstanding.  I highly recommend this episode.  I award it five stars.  Very entertaining.

The fourth episode of Season 4 is titled The British Grenadier.  That is the name of a village pub, whose owner is suffering from PTSD as a result of his experiences in the Falklands War.  His name is Frank Moon, and his part is played by veteran British actor Dennis Waterman.  Waterman later starred in the excellent BBC series New Tricks which, unfortunately, was taken off the air, much to my great dismay.  Once again, this episode was not taken from any particular one of noted author Reginald Hills novels but was written by Michael Chaplin.

The opening scene of the episode shows us a group of men and women, including Frank Moon and his wife  having a violent argument in the pub while a young boy watches in consternation.  The next scene shows us Moon waking up from a PTSD nightmare while sleeping in the back of his car in the woods.  He is having flashbacks from the war.  For whatever reason, Moon has concluded that his wife has been cheating on him with other men.  He is violently accusatory towards her, and in her fear and confusion, she reaches out to Superintendent Andy Dalziel for help.  He goes to the pub, but Moon returns, grabs a handgun, and begins waving it around threatening everybody.  The local elderly Police Constable comes and tries to take the gun away from Moon outside the pub, but it goes off and the policeman is shot.  Moon immediately orders everybody back into the pub, and a hostage situation quickly ensues.  Dalziel is trapped inside.

The Chief Constable, a very religious, but largely incompetent, police officer takes over the case because Dalziel cant be located.  Nobody knows that he is one of the hostages.  The head of the British equivalent of the SWAT team is an inspector with a reputation for being trigger-happy.  He was suspended, but has returned to duty.  Detective Constable Novello looks through a scope that the SWAT team pushes through a hole they have drilled in the wall of the pub, and she sees Dalziel.  She tries repeatedly to tell the Chief Constable, but he brushes her off.  Before long, Pascoe is also taken hostage and Frank Moon is wounded by a sniper.  Nothing good happens after that.

Needless to say, there are more deaths, and more injuries before the standoff comes to an end.  Much of the story is a classic hostage taking story, so a lot of it might be predictable to some viewers.  I did not particularly like this episode.  It is not as good as the other three episodes of the season, so I award it only three stars.  Still, it is an entertaining presentation, well worth the time spent to watch it.

All together, these four shows warrant a five star rating, in spite of the weakness of episode 4.  If you like Dalziel and Pascoe, you should acquire these DVDs and watch them.  It would definitely  be worthwhile.  Highly entertaining police drama at its best.",1514332800,,8648,4.633969716919026
