1215110,5,B00000G3AF,"If you can get past the fact that this is a concert, and NOT an actual Musical, then there is a wonderful production to be enjoyed here.  The casting is perfect.  Jewel, a relative unknown at the time, demonstrates  talents that will lead her well beyond the Title- Pop Music Star she holds  today.  The music throughout is a wonderful new interpretation of the  original.  The ""Behind the Scenes"" interviews were nice reminder  of the concerts purpose to benefit underprivileged children, and the  stories ultimate moral that ""Dreams can come True"".  My wife and  I first viewed this concert when it was broadcast on TNT cable; we had just  announced our first pregnancy. More recently, I've been enjoying this video  at the constant request of my three year old son. I strongly recommend this  version to anyone that's a fan of the Wizard of Oz.",936230400,13,847,4.751724137931035
1215111,5,B00000G3AF,"I just put my three year old daughter down for her nap after having watched the first twenty minutes of The Wizard of Oz In Concert.  Those twenty minutes were magical as I held my daughter in my arms and we watched  as a concert hall stage was turned into the Land Of Oz.  From Dorothy  (Jewel) to the Munchkins (Harlem Boys Choir), the voices, costumes, and  acting were all breathtaking.  My daughter whispered innocent questions  along the way and I hoped that I provided insightful answers.  This was  truly a fine bonding experience and one that will carry on into the future  with other performances of The Wizard Of Oz.  I do highly recommend this  video ONLY if parents are willing and excited to watch and help thier young  children unravel the many wonderful messages that this classic film has to  offer.  Enjoy this delightful journey into your own Oz!  My best, RTW",916704000,3,879,4.6103896103896105
1215191,5,B00000G3AF,"As we used to say while growing up in the sixties, when heaping the ultimate praise on a performance, this wonderful interpretation of The Wizard of Oz was quite simply groovy, boss, beta, bitchin, out of sight.
From the outstanding singing provided by the Harlem Boys Choir, to Jewell's breathtaking rendition of ""Over the Rainbow,"" to Roger Daltrey's swinging the mike in a wide circle and catching it, before starting his rock version of ""If I Only Had A Heart,"" to Nathan Lane as the Cowardly Lion entering the stage while spitting up a fur ball, as well as the remarkable jobs done by all the other actors and musicians, this exceptionally brilliant show was simply a tremendous joy to watch.
The only thing that disappoints me about this show is the fact it is not available on DVD.
I am a musical theatre junkie.  I rate this performance among the top three of all the shows that I have ever seen, which pretty much includes any musical ever performed on the stage or on film.",1046563200,5,983,4.5852272727272725
1215192,5,B00000G3AF,"I first saw this concert version of the Wizard of Oz when it first was airing and was positively thrilled.
Every performance was spot on -
Joel Grey did the part of the Wizard proud;
Roger Daltrey gave the Tin Man a Who-like showing on ""If I Only Had a Heart"";
Jewel's rendition of ""The Jitterbug"" was fantastic!;
Natalie Cole's Gospel-style singing of ""You're Out of the Woods"" shows off the pipes of this talented singer;
Nathan Lane's Cowardly Lion positively channeled Bert Lahr;
Debra Winger as the Wicked Witch was a hoot with her standard above-standard performance;
Jackson Browne's Scarecrow singing ""If I Only Had a Brain"" was marvelous;
The Harlem Boys Choir made a wonderful set of munchkins;
And the guest artists all made the concert a special event.
Darrell Larson did an extremely creditable job of direction on the entire production and is to be commended.
I've owned a copy of this for several years now and watch it regularly. The only thing that would top having this on tape and CD would be if they released it on DVD as well.",1031184000,10,1047,4.664864864864865
1215193,5,B00000G3AF,"I was so exited when i got this in the mail, the first thing i did was run into the living room sit on the couch and watch the Wizard of Oz in concert. After seeing the first 5 minutes i absolutly loved it. All the acting,costumes, and singing were terific! Nathan Lane was very very funny. Jewel was outstanding as Dorothy. Jackson Browne and Roger Daltry were very good and brought a new style to the original songs. All the others were fantastic. The only thing is you have to remember this is a childrens benifit concert not an actual movie. If you remember that I'm sure you will enjoy this video.",1025222400,10,602,4.336283185840708
1215194,5,B00000G3AF,"This video was filmed at a benefit concert for a children's foundation. There are no scenery props or elaborate costumes, but we found the actors' work to be fantastic; the whole concert is a gift for children and adults who like The Wizard of Oz. You can see the orchestra performing the whole time, which gives the viewer an opportunity to live the music. Actors' performances are a delight to watch, especially Nathan Lane (he is hilarious) and Debra Winger as the wicked witch (she is fantastic). I have to give special mention to the performance by the Harlem Boys Choir as the Munchkins and Toto; this kids showed incredible talent. I have watched this show with my 3 year old son several times since we got it. He is a fan of the movie itself, so I was doubtful whether he would like it or not. He was absolutely mesmerized! The different concept gave him the opportunity to appreciate good acting without the need of fancy costumes or other props. He has been acting out the show every day since he saw it. I sing and dance along with him and we've been having a great time!!",1024531200,4,1083,4.474747474747475
1215195,5,B00000G3AF,"Like many of the reviews of this product, I first saw this on cable TV.  When Jackson Browne and Roger Daltrey did their renditions of ""If I only had a Brain/Heart"", I knew I'd want my own copy.  Giving the song a modern rock sound was INSPIRED!  And what about Nathan Lane?  One word:  hilarious.  And I swear Judy Garland's spirit entered Jewel that week.  She was perfect as Dorothy.",978480000,3,386,4.428571428571429
1215196,4,B00000G3AF,"My daughter & I saw ""Wizard Of Oz"" In Concert on PBS twice.  I carefully watched the credits to see where I could find it to add to our collection, but had no luck in finding it.  We loved Joel Grey, Natalie  Cole, and Debra Winger brought a new look to the Wicked  Witch.  Nathan  Lane was marvelous as the Cowardly Lion, and Roger Daltry has just enough  shyness to be a truly effective Tin Man.  We managed to find the soundtrack  over a year ago, and now, thanks to Amazon.com, a two year search has come  to fruition.  Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!",958780800,6,556,4.2
1215197,5,B00000G3AF,"Wonderful performances from Jewel as Dorothy, Roger Daltry as Tim Man, Jackson Browne as Scarecrow, Nathan Lane as the Lion, Natalie Cole as the good witch and many more. Live benefit concert with star-studded cast is  well worth watching again and again. Especially great holiday fare - watch  this with your Kids!",944352000,14,315,5.038461538461538

7908875,2,B00000G3AF,"For someone who is a huge wizard of oz geek! This was extremely disappointing! The casting is sub par! First things first this is a concert version, this could work really well as a CD, but as a movie you are literally watching a concert. Minimal costumes, no set, they are just standing in front of music stands reading from a script, no real dog, just some kid barking and standing next to Jewel. Jewel makes a terrible Dorothy, I have much respect for her being her music is used in my preschool classroom for naptime :p but she is not a Dorothy! I would not waste your money on this if you are a die hard Oz fan.",1470009600,,616,4.184873949579832
7908876,5,B00000G3AF,"I somehow missed this program when it was originally aired on TV, then recently saw clips of it on Youtube.  As a life-long fan of the Wizard of Oz, I wanted to enjoy the entire show, but found that it was long out of print.  I located a good used copy from Amazon.  This is a wonderfully inventive take on the story as we remember it from the movie, with the same characters and songs, but some new laugh lines added.  I highly recommend it to Oz fans everywhere.",1406332800,,464,4.179775280898877
7908877,5,B00000G3AF,"I saw this on TV a long time ago and it was the only rendition of The Wizard of Oz that I could really accept. It was magnificent.
The newer version of Oz with James Franco ""Oz The Great And Powerful"" was wonderful too, but that was not a new version The Wizard of Oz. It was a prequel and that's why it worked.  Nobody should try to remake Judy Garland's Wizard of OZ.
Now does anybody know if this wonderfu Wizard of Oz Concert was ever on DVD?  Thank you very much.  Bob ""Ziggy"" Anderson",1401580800,,490,4.083333333333333
7908878,3,B00000G3AF,"I saw this on television when it first aired in 1995. I bought it when it first came out in VHS for my young children. Have watched it for years and enjoy it every time. HOWEVER, I am so disappointed waiting for it to be released on DVD and Blue Ray. there is another whole generation of children who would love this but VHS is going the way of Beta and 8 tracks. can we please move this into the 21st century. I now have grandchildren who would so love this! Please release this on DVD!",1351468800,,487,4.083333333333333
7908879,4,B00000G3AF,"The stunningly beautiful Roger Daltrey stole the show as the Tin Woodman at this show. His honest, passionate, emotional portrayal upstaged all the rest, including Jewel, Nathan Lane, and even Phoebe Snow, who did a lovely ""If I Only Had..."" medley. Not that the other performers weren't good.",1327536000,,293,5.125
7908880,5,B00000G3AF,This performance is incredible!  An amazing cast!  When will it be available on DVD?,1203206400,,84,4.928571428571429
7908881,5,B00000G3AF,"I have enjoyed the Wizard of Oz in Concert for years, and only recently discovered it online.  I only regret that it is not on DVD, allowing for a slightly higher quality, and hopefully the ability to watch the concert straight through without the side bits dispersed throughout it.  I definately recommend it for anyone who enjoys the Wizard of Oz.",1128211200,2,349,4.704918032786885
7908882,5,B00000G3AF,"I was blown away by this video.  When I heard that Roger Daltrey was in ""The Wizard of Oz in Concert"" as the Tin Man, I was anxious to see it, but a bit worried that it might not be as magical as the original.  I was wrong.

Not only is this performance for a good cause (The Children's Relief Fund) but it also incorporates many wonderful people into a marvelous retelling of the classic story.

Jewel is sweet and has just the right feeling for Dorothy.  Jackson Browne is perfectly cute and...well, dumb...as the Scarecrow.  Roger Daltrey is adorable as Tin Man!  I love his silver ""flower pot"" hat and stiff-legged walk.  Nathan Lane is hilarious as Lion.  Also, Debra Winger, Joel Gray, Natalie Cole, Lucy Arnaz, and the Harlem Boys' Choir were wonderful.

This is a very endearing version of the story and I will cherish it for years to come.",1122940800,4,848,4.483660130718954
