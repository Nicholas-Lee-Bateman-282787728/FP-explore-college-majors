3744264,2,B001P9N99E,"On the island of Tasmania, rumor tells of a thought-to-be extinct tiger roaming the woods.  A woman named Nina has photographic evidence of this beast, taken years previously by her sister, who later turned up drowned in the same area.  Nina sets off to catch her own glimpse of the elusive animal, taking along her boyfriend, his brother, and his brother's girlfriend.  Once the four enter the backwater locale, things quickly proceed from bad to worse as they run afoul of another local legend, the infamous Alexander Pearce, AKA ""The Pieman.""  An infamous escapee from an 1800s era prison who reportedly survived on human flesh, this real-life legend comes to haunt our cast in the form of Pearce's supposed offspring.

This was the third of the 8 Films To Die For I watched this year, trying to go in order of least to most interested.  From the trailer and synopsis, I went into this one with very little interest.

At first, I thought I might be headed for a pleasant surprise.  The film is absolutely gorgeous to look at.  Widescreen views of the heavily wooded waterways shrouded in ominous clouds gives the film a wonderfully eerie start.  Add to that the wonderfully likable Melanie Vallejo, and I was settling in for a good time with what appeared to be a good old-fashioned creature feature.

Unfortunately, the original premise of hunting for a fabled tiger turned out to be a misdirection.  The true horror lies in the confrontation with the locals - supposed descendants of the famous cannibal.  What was looking like a nice, creepy chiller turns into a run-of-the-mill ""hillbilly horror"" flick.  I don't think I have ever seen this sub-sub-genre pulled off effectively (unless you include TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE) - something about the redneck cannibals just always seems excessively cheesy and improbable.

But what really kills the film are the inanely stupid decisions the main characters make in the second half.  The first kill was effective and jarring, I'll give it that.  But after this, the remaining three become complete nimrods.  First, they seperate.  Second, they allow themselves to be led from one trap to another by one of the locals whom they have NO reason to trust!  In the end, you feel like they deserve to meet their ultimate demise!  By the time the film reached it's predictably gloomy conclusion, I was ready to eat these people myself!  It is sad, because I felt the movie set these characters up nicely in the beginning.  They seemed to be a level above the usual horror fare.  I actually liked these people - until they got stupid.

As I said, the setup was good, but once the slaughter begins, the script quickly runs out of ideas.  Creativity and suspense take a back seat to simple, straightforward gore.  Why set up an elaborate chase sequence, when you can just have an extreme close-up of a man chewing a woman's toes off her severed foot?  What filmmakers need to know today is that simply throwing blood and goo at the lens does not compensate for a lack of imagination.  Ironically, the one truly memorable death in the film involves the annoying brother-in-law, a bear trap, and VERY LITTLE blood.

Somewhere along the way, hints were dropped to suggest that the hillbillies have more in mind than just food - that they also are eyeing the main girl as a potential breeder . . . whatever, it's such a slapdash inclusion, it barely has any lasting impact on the overall proceedings.

All in all, this is near the bottom of the Afterdark heap for me this year.",1255132800,,3513,4.766556291390729
3744265,5,B001P9N99E,"Standard horror movies: everything's great, something spooky happens, something spookier happens, someone gets raped, murdered, mutilated, eaten, bludgeoned, cut apart, and oh my 5 more people to go! Did I miss the inbreeding? So sorry. Alexander ""The Pieman"" existed and so did the Tasmanian Tiger. I liked the fact that they stuck those two historical facts together although the main cannibal guy picking everyone off wasn't as great as I'd thought he'd be, I was hoping he'd pull out a banjo at some point and wow us with a jig at one point or another. The kid was creepy as well as the town cast (the main cast was good as well) and I found another movie that I can add to my collection of movies that will keep me from camping forever. If you're looking for an all out gore slasher where the only plot line is body parts everywhere with some guy running around trying to wear someones face, this isn't it. But if you like movies where you walk away still knowing why some things/people/places are better left alone, this is a good choice.",1254268800,8,1044,4.588235294117647
3744266,3,B001P9N99E,"Dying Breed turned out to be another strong point in this years After Dark Horrorfest Collection. While the story came across a little vague and confusing at times, every other aspect of the film was wonderfully pieced together. Thorough character development for a group of well portrayed and varied personalities helped keep you interested in the groups fate. I've seen several survival films set in the wilderness before and I'd classify this as one of the best I've seen. The scenery is beautiful and gritty which helps build an ominous atmosphere (and eventually turns into a bloody mess). The gore is wonderfully graphic and severe. My interest was captured early on and never let loose. This one was a blast to watch and comes recommended.",1246752000,,746,4.976
3744267,2,B001P9N99E,"This is basically a concept redone before - group of people go to isolated town of inbred cannibals. Add to this the need to 'breed' with some of the incomers in case the bloodline is too intermixed and we still don't get anything new. It was done recently in The Hills Have Eyes 2

The only differences here are the setting (in Tasmania) and the suggestion that an eight year old inbred girl is 'in heat' and is making herself available to be bred with. Fortunately (?) she's just interested in the end in feasting on human flesh",1242345600,,530,4.408163265306122
3744268,1,B001P9N99E,"Dying Breed is a huge waste in so many ways.  It trying really hard to be a ""shocker movie"" and a ""torture movie"" and a ""monster movie"" but fails all around.  History was really distorted in regards to the tiger and the pieman.  Not accurate at all, just odd jumbled mess.

It has very little about Tasmanian Tigers, and uses them as a marketing ploy to make it seem more ""Tasmanian"" but it is just a waste.  The only good part is the few video clips that are shown of real Tassy Tigers (filmed long ago and can be seen on all over the net).

By trying to be a shocker movie ""Dying Breed"" just copies other movies, and does that poorly.

At best Dying Breed is more of a redo of some other horror movies.  Nothing original here, even with trying to use the Tasmanian Tiger ploy.

No decent story telling, no plot line worth mentioning.  So gibberish about a sister who found a paw print and then died.  Really nothing new or different. First half of move is poorly done set up, but is not as bad as the last half which is just the same tried old blood soaked chopping, mutilation, slashing and two dimensional scare scenes.

You have probably seen it before.  Young people from a city lost in creepy woods find nest of weirdos who eat people. BORING time 12.

Suggestions:  Ditch the redo of other movies.  Drop stupid dialogue, write a real story, use people who can act, and not just scream.

Dying Breed is a waste of time, money, and effort.  I would give it zero stars, but that was not an opinion.

""Tasmanian Tiger"" by David Owens is a good book about the real story.",1240704000,,1574,4.310580204778157
3744269,2,B001P9N99E,"It wouldn't be a proper After Dark Horrorfest lineup without some kind of backwood hillbilly cannibal flick, and that's what we get with Dying Breed.  Taking place in the Tasmanian woods, Dying Breed follows a group of people (including Saw writer/co-creator/star Leigh Whannell and Wolf Creek's Nathan Phillips) who end up running afoul of the area's locales, learning some the area's dark history, and eventually wind up as dinner.  Yeah, Dying Breed offers nothing new in the least, but it does use factual elements in its effort to craft the story, even if it isn't done particularly well.  What really hurts Dying Breed however is that the cast is so wooden, and the film is pretty slow moving before the blood and gore (which is the reason why we're here to begin with) really kicks into gear, and even when it does, it isn't all that impressive, especially with some bad CGI effects.  Still, there are worse options instead of Dying Breed in this year's After Dark Horrorfest, so we might as well count our blessings.",1238803200,,1024,4.801136363636363
3744270,3,B001P9N99E,"""Dying Breed"" was one of the better films of the 8 Films To Die For this year.
The only slasher in the woods installment""I love a good maniac loose in the woods film"".My favorite sub Genre,The effects were great to lacking especially the Blatant and SO fake GGI axe to the face, the blood looked cartoon like.

I don't understand why they chose to go that route when they had other gore effects that were so authentic and cool. You will know exactly what I'm talking about when you see it. I love that the Dude from Saw that played Adam""Leigh Whannel"" was in this film as well as the last guy standing from Wolf Creek ""Nathan Phillips.

The story was interesting enough and it has enough punch to keep a horror/slasher fan interested and entertained. Just when you think it's over ""Viola"" power punch surprise ending. It was very Timber Falls meets Wrong Turn but not as solid as either but I watched it twice so I must have enjoyed it. Three and a half stars..",1238630400,,961,4.423728813559322
3744271,3,B001P9N99E,It led you to believe it was going to be a monster movie but it was really just a bunch of rednecks killing in the woods. Not bad but doesnt add anything original to the genre either.,1238112000,2,183,3.972972972972973
3744272,3,B001P9N99E,"I always laugh when a horror movie begins and ends with facts to read. Even if the filmmakers are alluding to actual events, do they honestly expect that the plot itself is deserving of a history lesson? At the start of ""Dying Breed,"" we learn about Alexander Pearce, an Irish convict who in 1822 escaped from a penal colony on the Australian island of Tasmania; in 1824, he was caught, tried, and hanged for murder and cannibalism. In the film, he's given the nickname The Pieman, although we now know that this is actually a reference to pastry chef Thomas Kent, another Tasmanian inmate who also escaped imprisonment in 1822. I can understand why writers Michael Boughen, Jody Dwyer, and Rod Morris gave that name to Pearce--students of ""Sweeney Todd"" know that cannibalism is a lot more fun when it's coupled with the skill and artistry of a baker.

This movie also tells us about the Tasmanian Tiger, a carnivorous marsupial that was once common throughout Australia and Papua New Guinea. As of today, some believe early European settlers hunted this animal to extinction, the last one dying in captivity in 1936. Others believe that a select few survived and continue to exist in isolated groups within the bushland of Tasmania. Sightings have been reported, although there's no actual proof of anything. There is, however, the ominous fact that many hikers have gone into Tasmania, never to be seen or heard from again.

What exactly do these two bits of information have to do with one another? ""Dying Breed"" attempts to make a connection, although it's weak, probably because there's no chemistry between them. Yes, there is that fact that both are part of the fabric of Australian legend. And then there's one of the film's most crucial subplots, in which the creepy townsfolk of an isolated Tasmanian village show just how far they will go to keep certain traditions alive; the obvious symbolism is that the townsfolk are struggling to survive, just like the Tiger. But that doesn't amount to very much in the grand scheme of things. Ultimately, two very different ideas are at work in just one story, and that's bad because they don't really belong together.

The plot focuses on an Irish zoologist named Nina (Mirrah Foulkes). She has now made it her mission to find a Tasmanian Tiger, which she believes still exists. The proof is in a photo of a paw print taken by her sister, who was also in search of a Tiger before dying mysteriously eight years ago. Nina's superiors refuse to fund a new expedition, so she has to rely on her Australian boyfriend, Matt (Leigh Whannell), who relies on an old friend named Jack (Nathan Phillips). Once Nina and Matt arrive in Tasmania, they travel with Jack and his girlfriend, Rebecca (Melanie Vallejo), into the frighteningly isolated village of Sarah, where it's always gray and rainy and the locals all have a distrustful, psychotic glint in their eyes.

The first three-quarters of this film could have worked as a character study, but alas, everyone is so broadly drawn that they come dangerously close to turning into cardboard. Nina, for example, is no more nor less than what the screenplay requires her to be at any given moment; when she doesn't need to be persistent, then she's curious, and when she's not curious, she's scared, and when she's not scared, she's lost somewhere between driven and confused. In other words, I didn't really know who she was. Matt, on the other hand, is so passive and even-tempered that he's just shy of completely boring. Rebecca is just an extra character, serving no real purpose other than being a companion for Jack. And as for Jack, he's probably the most developed character, which is annoying since (a) he isn't the main character, and (b) he's unlikable. He seems to lack the ability to keep his mouth shut when it's most necessary, creating tension between him and Nina, which in turn creates tension between Nina and Matt.

The horror element is there, but it's not much of a saving grace since so many of the clichs I grew tired of a long time ago are still being used. Only in this kind of film would anyone even consider exploring a shack located miles from anywhere. And not run when they discover that it's a House of Horrors. And actually investigate a stove when it appears that the contents of an abandoned pot are about to boil over. The only thing that prevented this story from bottoming out: A lack of sex-crazed teens stupidly wandering off alone while calling, ""Hello? Is anyone there?""

Still, clichs are better than back-stories that don't make a whole lot of sense. I watched the Tasmanian townsfolk in various scenes, and I got that they were driven to keep to tradition, but somehow, I couldn't make sense of the tradition itself, which involves both feeding and breeding. What exactly is director Jody Dwyer trying to tell us here? That one deadly species has gone extinct, only to be replaced by another deadly species? If that's the case, then why even bother bringing up the Tasmanian Tiger? Why not focus on just the townsfolk? I would have liked ""Dying Breed"" a lot more had it known which story it wanted to tell. The Pieman or the Tiger--make up your mind. I'd go for The Pieman, because God knows that, in a horror movie, watching someone eat a meat pie is better than reading the history of an elusive animal.",1231459200,8,5344,4.747039827771798

The keen editing and sound design help to heighten the impact and exhilarating rush of adrenaline during these moments for a terrifying overall effect. Let alone the gore, there are several cringe-worthy scenes that will have audience members reeling in their seats. Leigh Whannel leads a solid cast, and outside of a few questionable decisions, the characters act with intelligence and a survival instinct. What DYING BREED lacks in originality, it makes up for in thrills to prove itself a worthwhile entry in to the survivalist horror genre.

3744412,3,B001P9N99E,"There are rumors that the Tasmanian Tiger has been sighted on the Australian island of Tasmania. Nina, an Irish zoologist, believes that the mysterious tiger still exist. Her sister had came to the island looking for it. She had sent Nina a picture shortly before going missing. That was eight years ago and Nina and her group of friends go to the island to find the tiger, but then end up finding a group of cannibals.

The first thirty minutes of the movie has slow pacing and I almost fell asleep because of it. Things start to get interesting when the Nina spots something outside in the bushes, then the blood and gore starts. Dying Breed reminds of the Wrong Turn movies, but only set in Australia. The acting is decent, but the plot is somewhat cliched. It's not the best horror movie, but it is better than some.",1347753600,,820,4.503355704697986
3744413,1,B001P9N99E,"the After Dark Movies, have an ability to be either Terrible, or Amazing. This movie, Sucks. After Reading some reviews, and reading the plot, i thought i would love this movie, Boy, was i surprised. This is second On the list for worst for me. The worst is Dark Ride. don't even get me Started! This movie could have been so much better, if they had of spent a little more time working on it. The acting was terrible, All of the Characters, were Extremely Unlikable. usually, Good or Bad, there are likable characters in every film, but not in this one. I hated the Characters, and people who played them. It's ashame that they wasted a film, that could have been really great. All the plot talks about, is Finding an extict tiger, but the movie doesn't even follow that Plot, I Mean, it mentions the tiger a couple times, but that is it. Awful Movie, don't waste your time, or money.",1310342400,2,885,4.435582822085889
3744414,3,B001P9N99E,"Part of After Dark Horrorfest III, Dying Breed (2008) is a rather slow developing but pretty nasty terror in the woods tale, set in Tasmania.  Besides featuring some exotic locations, the screenplay co-written by director Jody Dwyer, incorporates uniquely Tasmanian elements that may not be that significant to those that are not familiar with the Tasmanian culture.  The setup takes a while, and involves some sketchy elements, but once the violence is finally set in motion, there are some grim and chilling moments.

Nina (Mirrah Foulkes) apparently a photojournalist, journeys to Tasmania with her boyfriend Matt (Leigh Whannell) with the hope of photographing the supposedly extinct Tasmanian tiger.  Some eight years earlier, her sister had supposedly photographed a tiger paw print, shortly before her death.  Matt's childhood friend Jack (Nathan Phillips), has agreed to provide ground transportation, and also has a boat for travelling on the river to the location where the tiger was supposedly seen.  Also on the journey is Matt's girlfriend Rebecca (Melanie Vallejo).

The party arrives in a settlement called Sara.  Long ago, Tasmania served as a penal colony as for the British.  Legend has it that an infamous escapee from a camp near Sara known as the ""Pieman"", apparently survived in the wilderness by eating human flesh.  Travelling deeper into the wilderness, they make the final leg travelling on the river.  Hoping to get photographic evidence of the mythical tiger, the group sets up camp in the woods.  It is here that things take a turn for the worse.

Dying Breed is 92 minutes long, and it takes past the 50 minutes mark before the violence begins.  Much time is devoted to developing the relationships between the two couples, but it may be too much preamble for some.  When the terror finally happens, events move along fairly well, though often not very logically.  After Rebecca goes missing, the group winds up turning to the locals for help.  This of course does not turn out well, and some tense encounters with the natives, the film ends with a dark twist.

Although it takes an eon before things turn nasty, writer/director Jody Dwyer succeeds in putting Tasmania on the horror landscape.  There are some chilling moments near the end, but the story is a bit uneven, with some large plot holes.  Time is spent building up the friction between Nina and Jack, and nothing much comes of it.  The quest to document the existence of the tiger, that is the whole reason for the journey, isn't executed very credibly.  Wandering in the woods with flashlights, attempting to photograph a wild animal at night, using a camera with a dinky lens is ridiculous.

The acting is not bad, with an animated Nathan Phillips helping to keep things lively, and Billie Brown is menacing as the leader of the locals.  Filmed under difficult conditions, despite its weaknesses, Drying Breed does finally deliver some scares, and a downbeat ending that may appeal to fans of the backwoods horror genre.  Rating: 2.5 stars.",1297555200,2,3034,5.007984031936128
3744415,4,B001P9N99E,This review is for Dying Breed NOT the entire horrorfest as i've seen below...Dying Breed was very creepy and very gory! Picture Deliverance but with blood thirsty psycho cannibals! Nathan Phillips of Wolf Creek and the Main Girl were both very good. They set out on a trip where the main Girl's Sister had previously died searching for an animal thought to be extinct...Things go very bad from there. The whole scenery was excellent and rain and such made this more scary in my opinion. Hunted and terrified they try to get back to civilization but at there every turn...Will they make it? I thought this was well made not as a horrorfest film but in general. This is a creepy thriller! Thanks for reading :),1278028800,,709,4.634920634920635
