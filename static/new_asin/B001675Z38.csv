8261367,1,B001675Z38,"With reference to the last few seasons, American Idol really needs to pull up its socks.

The weekly performances are high school amateurish at best save for the last episode where rock stars are invited to perform with the contestants.

These talented kids deserve better stage representation. American Idol might want to learn from X Factor. Performances are very slick, polished and really professional (to quote Ryan Seacrest). It's like watching actual rock stars at music award shows.

American Idol is better off exploring ways to improve it's presentation rather than spending time taking cheap childish shots at people. Make sense?",1333497600,,640,5.316831683168317
8261368,1,B001675Z38,"Buyer beware. If you're like me and wanted to relive the finale show in its ENTIRETY, this DVD will absolutely NOT deliver. If you're looking for all the spots where the other contestants perform with celebrities, you're not gonna get it. If you're looking for the the wonderfully sweet African Children's Choir, (my personal favorite), it's not here. So by entirety, I mean literally everyone else who was on stage besides these two finalists.  You won't see anything, and I mean ANYTHING except Blake and Jordan performing their songs, the judges critiquing them, and Chris Daughtry performing ""Home.""  That...is...it.

I partially blame myself for not properly researching this DVD first, but I guess I just didn't expect that a DVD that claims to be the ""Finale Performance Show"" will have shaved off everything but 40 minutes worth. The runtime on this DVD was certainly deceptive. I suppose the 90 minutes runtime was both discs combined.  What a disappointment.  This finale show was one that had so many features I enjoyed so it was let-down just to see Blake and Jordan when I wanted to see everyone else too.  Sure, some of the show was kinda stupid, but so much of it was just so entertaining and I wanted to see ALL of it.

So yeah...if you want JUST Jordan and Blake, then by all means, get this. It certainly does them justice I suppose.  But if you want everthing else, best just hunt it out on the internet.",1217548800,18,1423,4.709677419354839
8261369,5,B001675Z38,"I am a huge American Idol fan.  This DVD replayed the final showdown between Jordin and Blake.  I loved reliving every moment.  The DVD extras were also a treat.  It was fun to take a peek behind the scenes, and see what goes on when the contestants aren't on the stage.  I wish they would do this type of video (not just a ""best of"" or ""worst of"") for every season.",1212969600,4,366,4.098591549295775
