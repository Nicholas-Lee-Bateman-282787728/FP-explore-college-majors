8426007,5,B004DTS18M,Gotta love Mr. Rodgers.  Such a genuine individual.  I love his calm cadence in a world that demands 100 mph everything.,1411344000,,120,4.666666666666667
8426008,5,B004DTS18M,All of the magic that I remember from my childhood! I love watching these videos with my son! Great find!,1395446400,,105,4.3
8426009,4,B004DTS18M,These five episodes deal with adoption and how families come in all forms.  Mr. Rogers uses his wonderful way of helping children understand adoption on their level.  His explanation about his sister's adoption made me tear up.  My children are adopted and they love this series.  It introduces the topic of adoption in a casual way that all children would understand.  Mr. Rogers is the best thing to watch before our dinner meal.  It keeps the kids occupied long enough to pull dinner together and helps them to get into a calm state of mind for our meal.  Then we use dinner time to talk about what they saw on the show.  Only complaint is the cost of the DVD.  I don't think Fred Rogers would have approved of the $30 price tag.,1315353600,6,732,4.443609022556391
8426010,5,B004DTS18M,"What more can you say about Mister Rogers? Both of my children were adopted, so I am always on the look out for media that deals with how families are different. Mister Rogers may not be flashy and modern, but children (and parents) still love him!",1309392000,2,248,4.413043478260869
