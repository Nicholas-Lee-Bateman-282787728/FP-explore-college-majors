8684978,5,B00OU5WVS0,"An Italian made Robin Hood!!!! I love it and I am glad it is dubbed in English. I have enjoyed all the Italian made films (sword and sandals), except the spaghetti westerns. It is nice that this is added to Amazon Prime so members can watch them.",1510012800,2,246,4.25531914893617
8684979,5,B00OU5WVS0,It's rare to find this movie in color. I have another print that's black and white. This version is in color and better quality.,1492214400,3,128,4.375
8684980,1,B00OU5WVS0,All i can say is don't buy this disc . And i would suggest not to buy from this company PRS. To start with the movie clocked in at around one hour and fourteen minutes . It should have run 88m . That's 14 min of missing movie . But worse than that these morons re edited the movie by putting in their own opening credits and closing credits . Both poorly done . They also added in a couple of poorly made written dialogue screens to push along the film . These were not in the original film . I've never seen someone selling a film product who altered the original product without fair warning up front . If they had let you know that this was a re edit of the original film that would be ok . But this was a joke . If you like films and you want to see the film how it was meant to be seen stay away from this piece of crap company .,1491609600,3,834,3.8265895953757227

8684982,4,B00OU5WVS0,"OK Italian-made, English-dubbed early '60s swashbuckler.  Robin Hood, en route to the Crusades, gets picked up by pirates who intend holding him for ransom.  The ship sinks and everyone gets swept to the English shore near Robin's lands.  There he finds that an usurper has killed his father, stolen his inheritance, and is tormenting the populace.  Our hero enlists the pirates to aid him in his quest.  There are a few discrepancies in the film.  First off, the pirates' women are described by the locals as Saracens, but they look and act more like Caribbeans.  It is supposed to be the 12th century but looks off by a few hundred years.  Also the landscape looks a little too barren to be medieval England.  Where are the rolling misty green hills and lush Sherwood Forest.  Other than all that an adequate time-passer.  I bought the PR Studios DVD-R from Amazon and the transfer quality is extremely good.  Recommended for fans of the genre.",1432598400,5,946,4.771604938271605
