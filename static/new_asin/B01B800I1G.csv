7622540,5,B01B800I1G,"Wonderful acting on this show. The re-creation of 1950s England is fabulous. This series is inspired by Runcie's mystery series, but not a literal adaptation, which may bother fans of the books. I've read the books and watched the series and I think the series stands on its own and offers more intensity and drama than the books. The television series also examines many of society's moral dilemmas during that time, including the laws against homosexuality in place in Great Britain (until the 1960s, I believe), and post-war issues like PTSD and the changing class system. It is interesting to see how stories and characters from the books have been reformed for the screen. So glad to hear it has been renewed for a third season.",1462406400,11,733,4.825396825396825
7622541,5,B01B800I1G,Apparently people either love it or hate -- count me among those who love it.  It's worth watching just to look at James Norton.,1462320000,2,128,4.333333333333333
7622542,5,B01B800I1G,"Utterly gripping from the first episode to the last. This season is even better than the first and delves even deeper into the questions of morality, human nature and forgiveness. James Norton and Robson Green are a fantastic pair, can't wait for season 3!",1462320000,3,256,4.840909090909091

7622544,5,B01B800I1G,"I continue to enjoy ""Grantchester.""  The series is so much better than most television productions.  Season One was terrific.  OF COURSE in Season Two, the writers have to keep up the tension between Sydney and Amanda.  That is part of the fun.",1460851200,9,244,4.738095238095238
7622545,1,B01B800I1G,We liked season one so I read the books.  I was disappointed in the digression from the original story.  Season two looks like it will stray even further.  I have completely lost interest.  I will stick with the books.,1460419200,8,218,4.512820512820513
7622546,2,B01B800I1G,"Predictable Sunday evening TV. I find it telling that the writers sent Hildegard back to Germany and married off Amanda. They have to keep their pretty-boy vicar unattached and they want to maintain the sexual tension with Amanda. In the books Sidney courts and weds Hildegard and Amanda goes through a couple of disastrous engagements. Its rather unrealistic to keep him a bachelor, though. He needs a wife to help him keep up with his parish duties. He takes off so much time for crime solving, he'd be in trouble with his bishop.",1460246400,11,532,4.731182795698925
7622547,1,B01B800I1G,"Bad writers ruin James Norton. They are awful. Trite, predictable and silly.",1459987200,9,76,5.416666666666667
7622548,5,B01B800I1G,"Sydney Chambers and Geordie Keating are back! Season 2 has finally arrived, and I'm as hooked as ever. We're only two episodes in here in the States, but I know I'll be watching until the end of the season. I love all the characters -- even the peripheral ones, like the housekeeper and the apprentice curate. Their complex relationships and rich inner lives drive this British crime drama set in the town of Grantchester, outside of Cambridge.

The focus in the second season seems to be shifting a little. While Anglican priest Sydney (James Norton) is still the main character, the writers seem to be dividing their attention between the sleuthing vicar and his police inspector friend, Geordie (Robson Green). Geordie has some inner demons, perhaps stemming from being shot and almost killed last season. He seems harder and more unpredictable this time around.  (Did he really just punch a grieving widow in the face?) I'm hoping his friendship with Sydney helps stabilize him as the season goes on.

For me, the crime stories take a back seat to one of the main plots -- the relationship of Sydney and Amanda (Morven Christie). The two are long-time close friends who obviously have more than just affection for each other. Onscreen, the actors have oodles of chemistry! But, in the famous words of F. Scott Fitzgerald (or maybe just the movie), ""Rich girls don't marry poor boys, Jay Gatsby."" Heiress Amanda has been married off to a wealthy (and perhaps abusive) scion of business and is imprisoned in her lush life. She and Sydney long for their former closeness, but can the two be just friends? Geordie warns Sydney that men and women can't be just friends. I guess we shall see! But the real mystery for me? What is that book the curate, Leonard Finch, is forever reading?!?",1459814400,42,1786,4.792207792207792
7622549,5,B01B800I1G,"Classic British mystery series.  I would love to see this for 25 series.  I've bought all available, watched them all, and will watch them again as soon as I forget the plots.  (Given that I'm old, that won't take long!)",1505692800,,220,4.45

7622584,4,B01B800I1G,"This is a very solid series. It is set in the 50s in England. There is always a story about murder, but it's really a series about life. It explores human situations like grief, friendship, love, loneliness, mistakes, forgiveness, compassion, and trauma. One of the most refreshing things about it is the friendship between Geordie and Sidney. It's an honest male/male relationship that has nothing to do with sex. When do you ever see THAT on tv? Men are usually portrayed so macho that you don't get to see them as real people. This is refreshing in that it does this in such an honest way.",1485129600,,592,4.59433962264151
7622585,5,B01B800I1G,A cop and a vicar living with their WWII memories solve crimes in an English village.  An excellent depiction of the post-war experience with all the  complexities of the era.  Sensitive character portrayals without being sanctimonious.  We watched season 1 and half of season 2 on PBS and then our recorder screwed up and we lost several episodes.  It's a testament to how much we enjoyed this program that I paid for the DVD just so that we didn't miss the end of season 2.,1484265600,,475,4.541176470588235

7622588,5,B01B800I1G,"I just finished watching Season 2, in order. I had previously only been able to watch episodes here and there, out of order. Although I always liked the show, it was all a mish-mash. Now I know why. It is because each episode rests on the previous ones of that season. Each episode, unlike other mysteries, is not independent. If a person misses an episode, rots of ruck figuring out the next. And heaven forbid a person misses two in a row -- they are, how shall I say, screwed.

I look forward to Season 3, assuming there is one. I am dying to know what becomes of Sydney, Amanda, Amanda's child by another man, and this ""another man"" who, for all intents and purposes, I get the feeling, is bent on killing Amanda, or so Amanda implies.",1481846400,,739,4.355072463768116

Subject matter of this series is extremely relevant even tho is is set in time 50 years ago.  Subjects are treated with wonderful 'portrayals' of the prejudices people have on differing subjects.  Thanks to Sydney (James Norton) and Leonard (Al Weaver) their inner conflicts and compassion are there for all to witness and feel and experience.  Al Weaver is especially poignant as Leonard.  Wish they would make more episodes per series--seems like the series ""I don't like"" have many episodes whereas this one only has 6 per season???",1474156800,5,628,5.107843137254902

The story is principally about a Church of England Vicar and a detective in the local police force. The very handsome vicar is single but his heart is taken. The detective is a family man and both of them solve crimes together. The scenery where this was made is lovely and other characters help to make this very interesting series. Will the Vicar finally be with his love, that is for us to find out in season three. What a great series this has been.",1472428800,4,580,4.1875

7622623,2,B01B800I1G,"Very disappointed by the way that the tv series cheapens the plot of the books by adding a lot of frivolous dynamics that aren't in the books. The characters are much less credible and believable than the books, which are excellent. I liked the first season of the series although I had some of the same concerns, but this second season really went downhill. I think that what people respond to in the series as giving it a good rating, is that in the first place, the actors do a great job and secondly, that there is enough remnant of the characters showing through from the books and some of the affection that you feel for the characters built up in the first season. If you want to watch just one more of those dumb soap operas with the pat and predictable storyline of Eastenders, then by all means, you will like the second season. However, if you wanted something more subtle, believable plot lines, and characters that have some integrity to who they are, then you will be disappointed in this season.

Norton looks like he is swallowing cough medicine ----it shows on his face that kissing the actress is well, not his first choice.  Almost as if he is repelled by it. James Norton is just not a very good actor if we can see that --- after what is supposed to be a two season climax of Sidney and Amanda's dancing around each other.  Norton showed more emotion hugging Geordi moments before.  Oh.... So, an actor steps out of character and cannot bring himself to kiss a woman, and spoils the drama.

7622658,5,B01B800I1G,"First off, I would think that those coming to this review of the SECOND season of this British mystery series (produced by the commercial ITV Network  not the BBC) have already seen Season One. (If not, I apologize and highly recommend that you start with Season One so you can watch the characters develop.) So I won't repeat info from the first season. And this is a mystery series  and those who have read my other Amazon reviews know that I detest spoilers  or reviews that give away too much of the plot  so I will provide very little plot info here. The fun of a mystery is not knowing what will happen.

There are 6 episodes in this season and they vary in length from 52 to 58 minutes. Some of the episodes almost stand on their own (there are multiple crimes and murders this time) while others go back to an earlier episode for information. I will say  and this is not a spoiler that you will find it best to watch the 5th and 6th episodes back to back. The flow of story is better. Since the first season took time to introduce the characters, there is more time this year to flesh them out and understand them.

There is graphic violence and some though very little) strong language. And the series  based on a set of novels with the same title  does bring up some ethical and religious issues this season.  I don't know if the episodes were edited for PBS when shown on US TV, but, I prefer to watch a few episodes at a time and therefore prefer DVD or BD.

There are three bonus features this time. The best is the now-requisite Making of featurette (20 minutes) plus two shorter (7-to 8-minute) shorts on the crew returning to the actual village of Grantchester to film and the tension between Sidney (the Vicar) and Georgie (the police detective).

PLEASE, I urge you, not to watch any of the bonuses before watching all the episodes. Too much is revealed in the featurettes. I will say that I was satisfied that the season ended with enough loose ends tied to make it completely satisfying  but there is still enough of a plot device to allow for a season three, if one is contracted for.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

7622665,5,B01B800I1G,"Sidney Chambers is Vicar in Grantchester, Cambridgeshire. He has a black lab named Dickens, drinks too much and smokes too much  but this is the 1954, so attitudes differ from now.  Chambers is a good man and a good vicar, and also, incidentally, good at puzzles. Especially puzzles of the who-dun-it kind.

His best friend, Geordie Keating, is a Detective Inspector, and he couldn't stop Sidney from getting involved in solving murders if he wanted to. On the work front, Sidney has a curate, Leonard Finch, who has the heart if not the charm. And the vicarage is ruled over by the housekeeper, Mrs. McGuire, who is fierce and motherly at the same time. But mostly fierce. Like the time she vouches disapproval of a woman: ""She doesn't wear stockings!""

Grantchester, on the River Cam, is gorgeous. But like anywhere else, there are heartaches. Such as Sidney being in love with a married woman. Or Geordie haunted by his time as a Japanese POW. But there is a lot of comedy in this series, too. Such as when Geordie and his wife Cathy arrange some blind dates for Sidney.

There are many themes running though this series They reflect England in the 50's as well as resonating today. Questions about infidelity, mental health,  the church protecting its own, loneliness, illegal abortion,  being gay and closeted, police brutality, capital punishment (not abolished for murder in Great Britain until 1965), and, above all, friends trusting friends. As Robson Green says in the DVD Bonus Feature 1: ""It's one of those very rare hybrids that one minute makes people laugh, next time, it makes people cry. And it has very, very thought-provoking storylines.""

""Grantchester Series 2"" originally aired in March/April 2016. It has six episodes totaling 6 hours. Incidentally, the episodes have no names. The DVDs present the show in widescreen and stereo. English SDH subtitles are available on the episodes and the three Bonus Features.

Bonus Features:
....A.  ""The Making of Grantchester"" (11 minutes) Commentators include Robson Green (plays Geordie), James Norton (plays Sidney), Tessa Peake-Jones (plays Mrs. Maguire), Daisy Coulam (writer), Sandra Pearson (dog handler), Diederick Santer (executive producer), Neil Morrissey (plays Harding Redmond), Kate Gill (costume designer), Owen Mann (standby art director), Al Weaver (plays Leonard) and Ed Bennett (director episodes 5 & 6).
I was amused to hear that the black lab who portrays Sidney's dog, Dickens, has a stunt double for his swimming scenes.
....B.  ""Back to Grantchester"" (2 minutes) Commentators include James Norton, Robson Green, Daisy Coulam and Diederick Santer.
Santer says : ""Series 2 of 'Grantchester' is funnier than Series 1.... It's darker than Series 1. It's more complicated and messed up than Series 1.""
....C.  ""The Trouble with Sidney and Geordie"" (3 minutes) Commentators include Diederick Santer, Robson Green, James Norton and Daisy Coulam.
Green says, ""The scars of his time in WWII manifest themselves in this series. Something isn't quite right with Geordie.""

This show is based on the short stories written by James Runcie, the first collection titled ""Sidney Chambers and the Shadow of Death"". They film in the real town of Grantchester, as well as Cambridge and London. The church scenes are filmed in the real Grantchester church of St. Andrew & St. Mary.

I thought Series 1 of ""Grantchester"" was good, but Series 2 is VERY good. Though I admit I occasionally tire of the the Sidney/Amanda drama, there are strong realistic women in this show.  If you've missed the beginning of the show, you may want to catch it because it gives you the background/flavor of what is to come in Series 2:

No harm, no foul!",1464393600,2,341,4.9298245614035086
7622667,5,B01B800I1G,"A long wait for a second season, but then greatness can come slower. They got the little burg of Grantchester, near Cambridge, right the first time. This season is just more of the same. It is captivating, believable acted characters, and an emotional builder. 1953s sets, costumes, props, music, cinematography, whats not to like? It shows its worth taking the time to do it right.

Vicar Sidney Chambers by James Norton (Death Comes to Pemberly War & Peace); DI Geordie Keating by Robson Green (Reckless); beautiful love interest Amanda Hopkins by Morven Christie (oh I like her); and the housekeeper Mrs Maguire by Tessa Peake-Jones have all returned for all 6 episodes, as they did in season one. Al Weaver puts the collar back on trying meekly to do his religious bit as Leonard Finch for all 6 (5 in 2014).
New cast for season 2 includes greats: Claudie Blakley (Cranford Larkrise to Candleford) and Neil Morrissey as Agatha & Harding Redmond.

Sidney Chambers wrote the books this series is based on, which I have NOT read, but most of us know, adapting a book is often unlike the book. It takes a long miniseries to do justice to one book; like Outlander as done. Even that series picks, chooses, and adds.
Viewers get a murder in every DVD episode, but also great character development and ongoing threads through the season. Definitely a DVD series to OWN. Even knowing the outcomes, it is worthy of repeated viewings. At least thats what happens at our house. My wife and I both love Grantchester.",1463097600,,1508,4.751908396946565
7622668,3,B01B800I1G,"The second season of Grantchester suffers the same shortcomings as the first, namely that the plots are angst-fueled, characters self-absorbed, and no one acted this way in the 1950s without finding out quickly and in no uncertain terms that it was socially unacceptable. Honestly, the constant wallowing and self-obsession of these characters would have been considered mental illness. Even the gruff, working class DI Geordie Keating (Robson Green) gets into the act this time. On a positive note, this seasons structure is very different from the last. Instead of discreet episodes, there are ongoing storylines. The main storyline is introduced in the first episode and not completely resolved until the last. Each episode has its own mystery, but the subplots are connected.

It makes the episodes more cohesive but also more like a soap opera, especially since the subplots involve interpersonal relationships: Rev. Sidney Chambers (James Norton) reluctant search for a girlfriend, Amanda Hopkins (Morven Christie) unhappy aristocratic marriage, Leonard Finchs (Al Weaver) loneliness and new friendship, and housekeeper Mrs. Maguires (Tessa Peake-Jones) strained loyalty to her long-gone husband. Even Geordies marriage is troubled were not sure by what, but every relationship must be troubled. In spite of the tiresome behavior, I found Season 2 more entertaining than Season 1. This is due to the common threads and the excellent supporting cast, who provide welcome relief from the tribulations of the principle characters.

The episodes are:

To begin episode 1, Sidney is arrested out of the blue for sexual assault of 15-year-old parishioner Abigail Redmond (Gracie Brooke), who apparently described an affair with the vicar in a diary she kept. But the diary and the girl are now missing. Released for lack of evidence, Sidney and DI Keating go looking for Abigail, only to find her dead in a photographers studio where she had posed for illicit pictures. A pretty and ambitious but troubled girl, Abigail had expressed to Sidney fear of her father and guilt over something unforgivable she had done, but would say nothing more. She had confided something in another vicar in a nearby township, Sam Milburn (Andrew Knott), and in her simple-minded friend Gary Bell (Sam Frenchum) that might provide clues as to what troubled her.

Cambridge academic and climbing enthusiast Valentine Lyall (Rob Oldfield) falls to his death from the roof of Kings Chapel in episode 2. An apparent suicide, DI Chambers is convinced otherwise by a witness who saw two men climbing the roof and one push the other to his death. Sidney and Geordie visit the dead mans bewildered and distraught Burmese wife Mya (Lourdes Faberes) and his close friend and prot&eacute;g&eacute; Kit Bartlett (Matthew Tennyson), who was a fellow climber. What looked like a prosaic murder in which a number of people are lying about being on that roof takes a sharp turn into Cold War intrigue, when the Dean of the college asks Geordie to stop investigating lest he jeopardize an important project. But neither Geordie nor Sidney know whom to trust.

Episode 3 begins as young Theo Graham (Jeremy Neumark Jones) confesses with bloodstained hands to killing his landlord Mr. Eric Whitaker (Michael Shaeffer). But, when Sidney and DI Chambers pay the boarding house a visit, they find Mr. Whitaker alive and well and treating his wife Vivian (Liz White) badly. Later, Mr. Whitaker comes to the police station but is struck by an automobile just as he says he has something to tell Geordie. Sidney begins to suspect Whitakers unhappy and seductive wife of both crimes, but he is not, himself, immune to her charms. Meanwhile, Sydneys preoccupation with solving mysteries and his lingering feelings for now-married Amanda Hopkins threaten his budding relationship with police secretary Margaret Ward (Seline Hizli).

Sidneys insistence that he testify to what he believes is right strains his relationship with DI Keating, who needs to believe that criminals are bad and his own judgment infallible, in episode 4. The widower of a recent suicide, Reggie Lawson (Paul Nicholls), is convinced that his dead wife is haunting him and asks Sidney to help. Unconvinced, Sidney agrees to accompany Lawson to his palatial home to say a prayer, which he does in the presence of Lawson, his new wife Kitty (Eliza Bennett), and brother of the deceased Lazlo Herzl (Elliot Levey). A picture falls from the wall as Sydney speaks. Lawson shows Sidney the stables where his late wife was found hanging, then another death in the household causes Sidney to suspect foul play.

Amanda has used her social connections to solicit letters in support of clemency for Gary as episode 5 begins. Sidney is happy for the help but doubts that it will be enough. Geordie visits the home of Eddie Jones (Matthew Jure) and arrests him upon finding stolen property, after seeing Jones wife Rita (Tanya Franks) in hospital from domestic abuse. Jones is agitated and complaining loudly in his cell later that evening. Geordie pays him a visit and is blamed the next day when Jones is discovered dead, apparently from injuries received in custody. Geordie is suspended from the force pending investigation, and, in spite of their continuing disagreement over the fate of Gary Bell, Geordie asks Sidney to investigate the matter after swearing that he did not kill Jones.

The seasons ongoing storylines are wrapped up in episode 6, which finds Sidney drinking himself into dysfunction after the troubling events of the past few weeks. The Archdeacon (Geoff McGivern) proposes to replace him, which makes Leonard nervousand suspicious of the Archdeacons motives. Rev. Sam Milburn (Andrew Knott), from episode 1, turns up and pleads with Sidney but disappears after he is discovered, leaving Sidney and Geordie to fear that he has been killed. The main mystery in this episode is the search for Sam Milburn, dead or alive, leading to the resolution of the main storyline introduced at the beginning of the season, as well as relationship storylines for Leonard, Mrs. Maguire, and Amanda Hopkins.",1462492800,3,6130,5.159959758551308
