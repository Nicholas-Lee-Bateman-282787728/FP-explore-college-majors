8403449,5,B003R9K0H4,"There are those out there that despise Mya Communications for some of their slipshod past releases of inferior quality and high prices.  I tend to agree with a handful of some titles that I purchased, however, I still am a grand supporter of them because of their ability of locating rare Euro titles of which 'THE GIRL FROM CORTINA' is a true find.  A film that again is described as a late entry in the Italian Giallo canon, it definitely is not.  Without spoiling the experience, an abused wife plans on escaping her abusive artist husband and thanks to a superb story idea from Luciano Martino, the film relentlessly twists and turns into familiar territories but with fresh results climaxing into a nail bitingly unexpected finale.  Director Maurizio Vanni directs busily with superb and sometimes atmospheric camerawork by Giancarlo Fernando bringing the mountainous landscapes of the Alpine region of Cortina right onto your lap.  The acting by all is excellent with the female leads ,Valentina Gravina and Isabel Russinova, vying to out do each other.  The film is produced by non other than the great Sergio Martino who looks like he also had a hand in the proceedings and the progressive music score by Luciano Michelino bounces and pulsates to keep the viewer on edge.  Surprise to all you Mya bashers, the quality of the transfer is excellent with a Dolby Digital Italian soundtrack with English subtitles and its in full screen which may give hints this was made for Italian television even though nudity does arise in some sequences.  All in all, an excellent surprise release for lovers of thrillers and unexpected plot twists with some doses of atmospheric horror to make this film unclassifiable but highly recommended.",1293062400,9,1736,4.982698961937716
