2175863,5,B00068NVMK,"The Twilight Zone box sets that are allready out are AWFULL and I pity any fool who put their money into the extra-less, out-of order DVDs. THIS is the one to buy! They are jealous because they aren't going to see the great extras on this release. The cover art sucks, though...

Anyway, this is an INCREDIBLE show and well worth the (okay, so it is quite expensive) price tag. The extras look to be very good and the shows have been cleaned up and are now in a logical order. Make no mistakes, if you are going to buy this show on DVD, THIS is the release to get, not those crappy other box sets.",1099094400,17,597,4.146551724137931
2175864,2,B00068NVMK,"I want to start by saying that I will try to be as objective as possible in this review.  I have just read the various reviews listed here and wanted to add my personal insight from the perspective of a casual fan.

There are several reasons why I am not ranking this set highly.  1.) This is a show that has already been released on DVD in its entirety.  We did not get some of the episodes or only a best of set, BUT if you bought all the collections that Image produced (5 total), then you have EVERY episode of the Twilight Zone.  Therefore, 95% of the material on this NEW set, is the exact same episodes that you have seen over and over again.  Sure, the picture has been remastered on this new set and audio as well, but why wasn't this done to begin with?  Furthermore, I just played the Image discs and the quality on those previous discs is very good.  Will it really make that much of a difference?  Probably a little, but $400 worth?  I'm not so sure.  After all, that is what they are asking you to re-spend to buy them all over again even though you already have them.

2.) PRICE PRICE PRICE!!!  This set is way overpriced.  There are other tv season sets out there containing six discs that cost half as much.  You have to admit, this does support the ""corporate greed theory"" of previous reviews.  However, one positive review listed before mine wants us to think that ""Image doesn't expect you to double dip"" and ""I don't think ""corporate greed"" factors into the equation as much as customer demand from fans like myself (as well as the logical necessity) for one of the best shows of all time to have an exhaustive and organized set of releases.""  I WORK FOR A MARKETING COMPANY.  DON'T THINK FOR ONE SECOND THAT THEY ARE RELEASING THIS SET FOR THE FANS.  THE ULTIMATE GOAL IS ONE THING: MAKE MONEY!  How can we make more money from this series?  These corporations sit down and think of how many ways they can make money and how much.  And if that means re-releasing a product over and over again they don't care as long as it is selling and they are making money.  Your hard earned money.  I say that because it seems as though some people are really nave when it comes to this.  If they cared about the fans they would have a.) released a better set initially, or b.) charged a lower price knowing that most people already have their previous sets.  I mean the list price of this 6 disc set is $119.99.  One hundred and twenty dollars for six discs.  And for something that is already pretty much readily available.  That is a bit absurd.  Again, don't be nave.  Also, think about how greedy they really are.  This set was first brought to video through Columbia house.  Tons of money made there.  The whole set cost like $800 through mail order.  Fans ate it up.  Then they released individual dvd discs to fans.  More money for the studios.  Then the DVD collection sets.  EVEN MORE MONEY.  How many times are they going to repackage the same thing?  They are making money hand over fist on a show that was made forty years ago!  If that ain't greedy, I don't know what is.  Which leads me to my next point.

3.) This treatment should've have been done in the first place.  But they knew we would all buy previous editions, only to release something better later on and get us to buy it all over again.

Bottom line is this.  It is ultimately your choice as to whether or not to re-buy this series and set.  I will say that if you do not own the previous sets, then by all means this new set is recommended.  But that is just it.  If you are a fan, more than likely you would already have the previous sets.  It's not like the show is getting new fans all of a sudden.  I mean, you need to remember that it is forty years old.  I also don't think I can recommend buying it solely for the features (unless you are truly a die-hard fan that needs everything twilight zone, and even then, that is what they are hoping for so that they can get more of your hard earned money.)  Think about what features are included: (Rod Serling's `Next week.' Teasers).  If you own all the episodes, do you really need teasers?  I don't know about you, but I hardly ever watch the trailers that are included on dvds.  It's just a waste of time.  Audio commentaries made by people who worked on the show 40 years ago???  Most likely, these are new commentaries (or very recent) recorded for this set.  These people worked on this show 40 years ago!  My view on commentary is that it is nice to have, but definitely not a necessity.  After all, the real reason you are buying the set if for the show!  As you can tell, I'm not big on commentary.  Well there you go.  I am a fan of the show, and would rate the show very highly on its own, but I really question the INTEGRITY of the studios and companies that are making money off of this re-packaging scam.  Thanks for taking a brief detour...through the Twilight Zone.",1099094400,42,4922,4.308196721311475
2175865,5,B00068NVMK,"Right around the time of their release a couple years ago, I invested in Image's series of five 9-Disc box sets that collected every Twilight Zone episode from the original '59 series. From a collector's standpoint, this seemed like a great move, as these sets turned out to be much more affordable than the previous releases, which were 45 individual volumes. I figured I had the collection and could sit back and relax. I really enjoyed the sets (my reviews of them can be found here, as a matter of fact) and watched them ritually once I owned them.

In March 2004 when the rumors first hit that definitive season-by-season sets were to hit, I put my collection on e-bay and received almost all the money I invested in them in return. Yes, as a diehard TZ fan, I support the definitive releases wholeheartedly. Part of being a DVD collector is knowing that upgrades are imminent. In fact, this may not be the last time I invest in the series... experts forsee Blu-ray coming into play within the next 5 years and a company like Image with no single film or TV property to their name bigger than The Twilight Zone may someday release these with HD transfers on Blu-ray disc. DVD, like a cheaper version of Laserdiscs, is ten times the collector's format that VHS ever was.

In short, Image doesn't expect everyone to upgrade. They're not trying to bleed the same customers dry. But they are making a ton of the diehards and DVD collectors truly ecstatic. What hasn't been mentioned in any of the reviews here yet is THAT THE VIDEO AND AUDIO HAVE GONE THROUGH A RESTORATION PROCESS -- they LOOK AND SOUND BETTER than they ever have before, whether your first exposure to them was on CBS in the early 60s, in the late 70s (when the re-runs were very popular), or during the holiday marathons of the 90s and today on the Sci-Fi Channel. Not only that, but included are Rod Serling's ""Next week..."" teasers and, for the first time, audio commentaries by major players in the episodes themselves as well as crew members (Martin Landau in ""Mr. Denton..."", Earl Holliman in ""Where is Everybody?"", and Kevin McCarthy in ""Long Live Walter Jameson"" immediately spring to mind). As a TZ diehard, I thought I'd seen and heard as much as I'd ever get to, but Image has put together something new for me to look forward to. The ""audio lecture"" Amazon refers to is from Sherwood Oaks College and is split into several parts. There is a great deal of discussion regarding ""Walking Distance"" for instance -- and we are able to listen to it while watching the episode at the same time. It runs nearly the entire length of the episode. Real treats also include Zicree's interviews conducted in the late 70s for the writing of his book with such stars as Burgess Meredith and Anne Francis.

Also -- the old collections tried to theme the episodes on each disc, but this simply didn't work for me. Too often I'd only want to watch one of the episodes on a disc and would have to frequently change out. With this set, we'll be getting the first season which, in a point that is rarely disputed, is the best of the series:

Where Is Everybody?, One for the Angels, Mr. Denton on Doomsday, Sixteen Millimeter Shrine, Walking Distance, Escape Clause, The Lonely, Time Enough at Last, Perchance to Dream, Judgment Night, And When the Sky Was Opened, What You Need, The Four of Us Are Dying, Third from the Sun, I Shot an Arrow into the Air, The Hitch-Hiker, The Fever, The Last Flight, The Purple Testament, Elegy, Mirror Image, The Monsters Are Due on Maple Street, A World of Difference, Long Live Walter Jameson, People Are Alike All Over, Execution, The Big Tall Wish, A Nice Place to Visit, Nightmare as a Child, A Stop at Willoughby, The Chaser, A Passage for Trumpet, Mr. Bevis, The After Hours, The Mighty Casey, and A World of His Own.

So while Image doesn't expect you to double dip, you gotta feel good going knowing you have that option someday. I don't think ""corporate greed"" factors into the equation as much as customer demand from fans like myself (as well as the logical necessity) for one of the best shows of all time to have an exhaustive and organized set of releases. Take care and we'll see you in the fifth dimension!",1098748800,458,4219,4.575396825396825
2175866,5,B00068NVMK,"This new DVD version of The Twilight Zone 1959 Season One is remastered from the original camera negatives and the original magnetic soundtracks. It has the best picture quality ever and is a great set for fans.

This six disc set is packed with some wonderful extras-
*Audio commentaries by Earl Holliman,Martin Landau,Rod Taylor,Martin Milner,Kevin McCarthy,Ted Post and William Self.
*Vintage audio recollections with Burgess Meredith,Douglas Heyes,Richard L Bare,Buck Houghton,Ann Francis and writer Richard Matheson.
*Rod Serling audio lectures from Sherwood Oaks College.
*Isolated music scores from Bernard Herrman,Jerry Goldsmith and more.
*Rod Serling promos from ""next weeks show"".
*The original unaired pilot from ""Where Is Everybody?"" with Rod Serling's Network pitch.
*Rare Rod Serling blooper.

Some information about the above audio commentaries- Ann Francis starred in the classic 1950's movie ""Forbidden Planet,Kevin McCarthy starred in the original 1950's version of ""The Thing"",Rod Taylor starred in the classic Hitchcock movie ""The Birds"" and the 1960 George Pal classic ""The Time Machine"".
Martin Landau guest-starred in both the original 1959 and 1985 versions of The Twilight Zone as well as the original ""Mission Impossible"" and ""Space 1999"".
Writer Richard Matheson also wrote stories for both of the original and 1985 Twilight Zone series.

This classic television show has become part of western culture and language. People now the term use the term ""in the Twilight Zone"" for description in newspapers or interviews. It's starting do-do-do-do theme has now become part of the culture and is used to denote something strange happening. The singing group Manhatten Transfer even had a top ten record with the title.

One note of criticism- this new version is a wonderful effort for a show that is 45 years old,but fans that have bought previous sets could be entitled to ask why this wasn't done in the first place,some having spent many hundreds of dollars on the three previous releases. Firstly,we had the ""best of"" TZ 40 episode set followed by the 4 episode discs sets followed by the Volume 1 through to Vol 5 sets. And now we have this new set. That is enough to test the patience of any fans and they have every right to complain at this sort of exploitation.
In a few years,I predict that a new TZ set in high definition will be released.

So fans,if you want the definitive(we hope)DVD box set on the original Twilight Zone,then sell your other copies and buy this.
It is really well done and hopefully fans can keep this for many years to come.",1098316800,153,2583,5.1258907363420425

2175868,5,B00068NVMK,"Going on sixty years and the stories are still as fresh and creative as ever. Serling and his staff were so far ahead of their time! No scary monsters (except maybe one episode), just mental twists and turns - the unexpected from start to finish. In all my years, I've never seen anything as well done as Twilight Zone on television, and perhaps (to some extent) in theaters. I learned to play the theme on the piano, and it always brings a crowd!",1512864000,,447,4.397590361445783
2175869,5,B00068NVMK,"I love this series, but I was unable to watch these DVDs. My wife always loathed ""The Twilight Zone"" and would give me a hard time every time she caught me watching it. I tried to watch some episodes on my laptop at work but my boss wouldn't allow it.

My luck changed one day when there was a worldwide nuclear war and I was the only survivor left on earth. Despite all the devastation, the electricity was still working, and I finally had all the time I needed to watch every episode of ""The Twilight Zone"" on DVD! However, as soon as I put the first disc into my DVD player, the machine fell off the shelf and broke into pieces. It wasn't fair!!!! I finally had time!!!!

---------------------

Now that I got that comical review out of my system, I want to say in all seriousness that ""The Twilight Zone"" was one of the best series in the history of television. Rod Serling's creation was fully deserving of the critical accolades it received and the Emmys it had won. All 36 episodes of Season 1 were remastered for DVD from the original 35 mm films, and have amazing picture and sound quality, as if they were made yesterday!

My review is of ""The Definitive Edition"" which I highly recommend over the ""Episodes Only"" collection. The numerous ""extras"" on the ""Definitive Edition"" are awesome!

These include interviews with various cast members and directors, and some commentaries to specific episodes by cast members and directors, recorded especially for the DVD collections about 45 years later! There are also audio recordings of some of Rod Serling's college lectures from the mid-1970's. Listening to these are as close as you may ever come to meeting Rod Serling in person!

Also included among the bonus features are selected 40-minute episodes of the ""Twilight Zone"" radio series made in the 2000's, based on Rod Serling's original scripts for the TV series. There are also clips of Rod Serling appearing on other TV shows, such as ""The Jack Benny Program"" and Tell It to Groucho"". There are two clips of Rod Serling accepting Emmys for his writing on ""The Twilight Zone"" and a fascinating interview of Rod Serling by Mike Wallace from 1959, when ""The Twilight Zone"" was only in the planning stages.

""The Twilight Zone"" had first-rate music scores which most people take for granted when watching the episodes. Bernard Herrmann and many other great composers wrote and conducted original music scores especially for specific ""Twilight Zone"" episodes. About half of the episodes included in the ""Definitive Edition"" include the bonus option of watching the episodes with JUST the music, minus dialogue and sound effects!

Almost every episode originally included a short preview of the next episode, with Rod Serling giving brief but tantalizing descriptions of the next week's journey while using some of that episode's props and sets. These next-show previews were not included in syndicated reruns, but they've been restored for the DVDs. (Unfortunately, in a few instances only the audio portions Serling's next-episode previews are known to exist, and in such cases they are run with a black screen.)

If you own a DVD player, you do NOT have to settle for watching syndicated reruns, which have footage deleted to allow time for more commercials, intrusive onscreen ""promos"" obstructing the picture, and somewhat muffled or tinny audio. Buy the ""Definitive Edition"" of Season One on DVD and experience the Twilight Zone as it was meant to be experienced!",1512086400,,3476,4.908006814310051
2175870,5,B00068NVMK,never knew how great this classic was up until i watched this when there was nothing else on.  i am hooked! recently bought an Amazon firestick and found this on their Prime list.

2175871,5,B00068NVMK,"Rod Serling's thought-provoking and heart-thumping morality tales are brilliant.

2175873,5,B00068NVMK,"The Twilight Zones series is truly liken to a ""timeless dimension"" because of its continuous run since its inception!
One of my favorite episodes comes from season 1 episode 21 ""Mirror Image.""As a writer, I have imagined what it
would be like to write my own episode. It finally came to me when seeing this specific story. In the original plot,
the man that came to the bus station that turned out to be of some help to the woman, had earlier been in an
accident. And it got me thinking about a possible alternate ending....

(picking up just after 21:30...)

EXT - BUS STATION - DAY

A police car drives off with Mrs. Barnes in the back. Paul walks back into the bus station.

INT - BUS STATION - DAY

Paul enters, walking to the clerk.

Clerk: Did you get her off alright?

Paul: Yea. They are going to take her to the hospital for observation.

Clerk: What was she talking about? That thing about another life?

Paul: I don't know. Apart of her illness I guess. You said the next bus is at seven?

Clerk: Got about four and a half hours pal. You can take a snooze on that bench. You'd be all alone.
No noise whatsoever. This place is like a tomb between now and then.

Paul: Maybe I will get some sleep.

Paul sets his things beside the bench and prepares to sit down.

{Commercial break}

Sometime later....

A police car pulls beside the Bus Station. An officer enters.
The Clerk looks up from his book.

Clerk: Good morning Officer.

The officer nods.

Clerk (cont) How is she doing?

Officer: Not sure. They are holding her for observation. It will probably be a day or two until
they know for sure.

Several emergency vehicles make their way up the street along with police cars.

Clerk: Would you look at that? I wonder whats going on?

Officer: Earlier this morning there had been a traffic accident in the next town.

Clerk: Gosh. I hope everything was all right?

Officer: It was a bad night. A couple of accidents from neighboring towns. One involved a car hitting
a tree. The other...a bus.

Clerk: You don't say?

Officer: That's also the reason for my visit. The bus involved made a stop here just before the accident.
It's a good thing she wasn't on it.

Clerk: Hey!? Did you hear that?!

The Clerk looks toward the waiting area. There is nobody there.

Clerk: Where did he go? He was here earlier.

Officer: Who, sir?

Clerk: Uh..it was nothing. As you were saying..about the accidents?

Officer: Yes. The other one involved a car crashing into a tree. The driver was alright but the passenger
in the cab was found dead a couple of blocks up the street from where it occurred. He
was supposed to stop here to catch a bus.

Clerk: Here?

Officer: Yes. From what the cab driver had told us. Talk about bad luck.

The clerk looks back at the waiting area.

Clerk: Hey, who was this poor fella by the way?

Officer: Paul Grinstead. A man in his thirties. Tall. Hat and trench coat, carrying a travel bag. Why?
Anybody you know?

The clerk stares back into the waiting area.

Officer: Sir? Is everything alright? Sir?",1507075200,,3030,4.44

2175955,5,B00068NVMK,"Perhaps what I like about Rod Serling is that he will take something that is very familiar and then take left turns fearlessly telling his story to make it into something much different and quite surreal.  I chose surreal instead of unbelievable because like in dreams the possibilities seem endless in the hands of a master storyteller.  In the intro just the words it is the middle ground between light and shadows really makes your mind race.  The show is also a showcase for many talented actors some of which were already names, but even more who go on to greatness and you get to peek into a time when they were only aspiring such.  There really isn't anything like it today even with the superior special effects and wide-open avenues of multiple delivery platforms.  This show just hit a certain amazing sweet spot of exploration of the unbridled mind. This is one show that black and white film is absolutely the preferred medium, it could hardly be better.  In it's realm this is the absolute gold-standard TV show ushering in a wave of more sophisticated Sci-Fi, yet never really surpassed.  Watch TV history and greatness here.

My dad allowed me to watch it along with him and I was captivated every week! The quality of the restored B&W episodes are really quite amazing to watch today. Being a photographer myself, the cinematography is first rate! Rod Serling was a master. Many up and coming actors played characters in the 156 episodes. I will never forget meeting Mr. Serling in person while he talked to my journalism class in 1974. His speech that morning kept our class glued to their seats. He was most friendly in person. I took a photo of him that morning which I still cherish. This format had never been done before in television & it is amazing how each week the Twilight Zone kept viewers spellbound in just a one half hour episode. Serling really showed Hollywood how to make a compelling series on TV.

2176843,5,B00068NVMK,"Five stars without hesitation.  Everyone already knows the Twilight Zone remains as one of the greatest television series of all time.  The actors are top-notch.  The themes concerning the dreams, desperation, and fears we face in a rapidly changing world -- privately or collectively -- are as relevant today as they were in 1959,  Rod Serling's teleplays are often clever and always sharp.  And, of course, his introductory and concluding narratives are, as some observers have said, a form of beatnik poetry.  Altogether, it's as addictive as the hundreds of cigarettes that are smoked throughout the season.

What surprised me was the high quality of the picture and sound.  Previously, I had seen the series in the form of repeats broadcast by local television stations (grainy and with static) -- no more of those distractions with the streaming version!  The IMdB notes are another bonus.  The short biographies of the cast members for that episode are especially fascinating and sometimes saddening..",1464480000,,1008,5.204968944099379

2176848,5,B00068NVMK,"A pop culture icon straight from the height of the cold war. The Twilight Zone had an all-star team of writers and directors. It's one of those old TV shows that is referenced constantly even to this day, from the theme, to a monster on the wing of a plane, or some poor guy breaking his glasses. You simply cannot live without watching at least a few episodes. That classic Americana vibes make the show almost dreamy now almost sixty years later. Give it a watch, you won't regret it. Oh, and tread lightly because about to enter The Twilight Zone. Cue music.",1464393600,,561,4.456310679611651

2176894,5,B00068NVMK,"Rod Serling is a superb story teller.  These episodes are a step back in time to when the U.S. was a simpler, clearer & easier to understand place.  Everything kind-of made sense back then, even in our country's paradoxes & failings.

The stories are mostly White-Post WWII-American-Man-centric.  Through the lens of a life-hardened man, women always seem to be nicely outfitted accessories.  It's like living life inside the heart, mind & gut of Rod Serling and his contemporaries. He moves us around ""from the pit of man's fears to the height of his knowledge,"" with surprise twists and profound ironies along the way.

It's a wonderful period piece.  I learn so much from each show and find them endlessly fascinating.  The show is also great to watch before bed; a nice, bite-sized, digestible snack.

The show is also neat because it is not informed by modern science.  Using meteors as prison colonies that look like Utah?  Sure, why not.  Having a young girl hit by a car and end up with no broken bones, but in bed feeling sick?  Check.

The show is not science fiction in the sense of deep understanding of science.  The show is really about the human imagination and where it can take us.

They just don't make TV like this anymore.  I love it!",1462924800,2,1254,4.65296803652968
2176895,5,B00068NVMK,"HA! What comment is necessary? It's Rod Serling. He rules!

I'm an old man. I've seen every episode at least twice I'm sure. It's just really nice, as the day winds down, to sit there relaxing, cat curled up on my shoulder and going through my own little Twilight Zone. LOL My goal is now to watch 3 or 4 episodes a night & watch the entire series in sequence - although I'll have to rent or purchase Season 4. Hahaha.

Anyway, if you pay attention, every episode offers a good ""moral to the story"" kind of ending...like Aesop's Fables. Only the animals are two legged, and the world is the 5th dimension.

2176974,5,B00068NVMK,"If you're old enough to remember ""Twilight Zone"", but not quite old enough to remember every episode and plot twist, then this is for you.  I enjoy watching the old episodes, catching some ubiquitous TV stars of yesteryear in their early days picking up some lunch money for an episode or two. Some episodes end with a plot twist, a couple that you can see coming from the start - see ""A nice Place To Visit.""  A few are downright scary - ""The Grave"" starring Lee Marvin has been my personal lifetime nightmare.  I recommend watching at night just before going to or already snuggled in bed.  I am enjoying watching them sequentially, but that is just a personal preference.  On the down side, these episodes are better than 50 years old, so seem a bit tame today; the black and white format reinforces that feeling.  But if you're bored with today's TV, this might be one alternative. It works for me.  Snuggle in your chair, tune in and enjoy.",1459209600,5,945,4.523529411764706

2176995,4,B00068NVMK,"I'm 64 years old so I can remember watching The Twilight Zone on live TV.  I was surprised to see so many familiar (now) actors's faces in the episodes.  Each episode has a different cast of actors.  I was also amazed to see how bad the acting and script writing was but I think that was typical of that day and time.  Of course the shows are all in black and white - nobody had color TVs back then, at least my mom and dad didn't.  Some of the story lines are pretty infantile and completely predictable but a few of them are interesting with plot twists that you don't expect.  At any rate, it is nostalgic blast from the past and I have enjoyed watching the shows.  Since each one is only about 25 minutes long and is not a continuing series, you can just watch one or two when you have a few minutes.",1458000000,,804,4.115384615384615

2176997,4,B00068NVMK,"I bought all 5 seasons, one at a time and in order, from Amazon, which did offer them much cheaper than in stores. The price is lower now than what I paid!!! There is also a newer packaging with a different cover for about $20, less than half of what I paid when this originally came out.

The shows are great, the remastered picture and sound is good, and there's many special features. Season 1 even came with a book about the entire seasons, including reviews of every episode --- I enjoyed that.

The best seasons are 1, 2 and 3. Seasons 4 & 5 each have some great episodes, but fewer than the first 3 seasons. Season 4 had one-hour episodes (while the other seasons had half hour episodes) and it's the weakest season by far.

If you loved this show but aren't sure about spending the money, get the first 3 seasons only. If you want it all, get the definitive collection with all 5 seasons together and save a lot of money.",1457827200,,929,4.297142857142857

First, what an amazingly written show. The 2 minute set ups to the episodes that Mr. Serling recites are almost poetry.  Second, what a realistic yet pessimistic understanding of adulthood.

2177174,5,B00068NVMK,"Rod Serling's ""Twilight Zone"" television series is no doubt the best of its kind by which all other anthology series are judged. The amazing array of name get stars, original and riveting plots, incredible film noire staging, and twisty plots and endings make this a true one-of-a-kind series. I grew up with this show, and it is always being run by some broadcast, cable, or satellite network. It is so good that you have a hard time stopping if you decide to binge-watch this series.

Rod Serling had a wonderful way of exploring human nature -  the good, the bad, and the ugly. Nearly every show ends up being a well crafted story with a moral of some kind. In between starting the story with Serling's prologue and the ending epilogue, you will always learn something from the story that is told.

Many have compared Serling's story telling with that of the short story master O. Henry. The common approach to story telling is undeniable. Introduce characters, a situation, and then run with it for a short time. The story nearly always concludes with a surprise or twist ending that leaves you wondering about life, the universe, and everything

I have seen many of these episodes dozens of times through the years. I never turn down watching on, even if I know it well. They are so well written, acted, and staged that you can't take your eyes off of an episode once it begins. There are very few television shows I would give five stars; Rod Serling is definitely one of them, Watch it - you will love it!",1449187200,,1512,4.588888888888889

Watching it now after all these years I see the flaws, the poor acting, silly scripts. But for whatever reason I still enjoy it. Rod Serling's narration is what make it interesting. It's one of those hit and miss shows where some are good and others not so much. I gave it 4 stars for nostalgia more so than quality. I am midway through the 2nd season and will most likely watch the entire series. What I find amazing is that after 50+ years I still remember some of the stories. It's worth a look, I think you'll either like it or hate it but no harm in checking it out.",1440201600,,669,4.153846153846154

simple 25 minute episodes.  always interesting story lines with great plot twists at the end.
Serling and his crew were great screen writers. crisp dialogue, rarely more than 3-4 characters in a script.
its just plain fun to watch this period piece from the late 50's early 60's.
one note- i think he must have bought the spaceship ""set"" from the movie ""the day the earth stood still"".  it seems to pop up in several episodes.  one of the fun aspects of science fiction is seeing how the technology of a time period influences their vision of the future.",1439251200,,736,4.623076923076923

2177520,5,B00068NVMK,"When I was younger I would watch twilight zone marathons with my parents n I always thought this isn't scary ?! This is black and white ;this is boring !... ( I don't remember how old I was when I first started watching them) then when I got to be a teen I remember the real infamous ones like ""nightmare at 20,000 feet""; the one with William shatner and the monster on the plane or "" night call"" with the older lady who gets constant harassing phone calls only to find the source of the calls coming from a terrifying place ( don't want to reveal where !"" And I began to appreciate the so called "" good"" ones Now, here I am in my forties and about 2 years ago I got my first kindle as a gift ( little did I know at the time it would soon become my constant companion) and I started to go over movies and TV shows that I never had time to watch and I soon returned to the twilight zone ; the original and......  im mesmerized ....from seeing a young Robert Redford verbally battle with an older woman who is afraid of him, claiming he is Mr. Death to seeing Russell Johnson pre Gillian's island not knowing what to do with a criminal who pops out of his time machine ; I am coming to appreciate the subtle and not so subtle meanings of each one ; some are about the appreciation of life and not to be so afraid of death ; others reference how easy it is to get ppl in a tizzy over nothing and start pointing fingers at each other a la The monsters on maple street. Each one has something to appreciate about it. This review was supposed to be about the first season and I've bled into the other seasons but having watched so many of them at once I would give five stars for every single episode Even the not so great ones ( one about a magical seer with William shatner comes to mind ) are still fun to watch and have something in which to appreciate. I could go on and on about TTZ Rod Serling was a genius IMO ; the acting is top notch and to get this kind of feeling and emotion out of things without resorting to CGI and other ploys used in today's market is truly a magical gift one I've come to fully appreciate .... I am stuck in the 6th dimension ..... Or is that fifth? ( amazon users get a tidbit about Rod saying 6 th dimension at first until the execs questioned him about it TO which he replied aren't their five dimensions already ...?

As a writer myself, I'm left in awe at the end of every episode. To be a person at the time when these episodes were first airing on television must have been quite the experience, and even now these stories still stand the test of time. The plots, characters, and scenes will stay with you for the rest of your life in a way that will haunt you for the better.

Many from the casts of these teleplays went on to have very successful and staring careers after this show. Twilight Zone is exceptionally well written and preformed on sets that are not elaborate but provide sufficient setting for the scene, Shows end in a twist that are ironic and sometime surprising and at times are like fables giving a lesson on toward decent behavior without being preachy or moralistic. The show is in black and white which is what was available for TV at the time but is also suited for the stories where often there is a struggle between good and evil, black and white.",1435363200,,726,4.549618320610687

2177634,5,B00068NVMK,"Twilight Zone is an iconic TV show of the late 50's and early 60's with incredible story lines penned mostly by Rod Serling.  Also of interest is all the stars who acted in the series, and later went onto their own series or a movie career.  Everyone has to start somewhere, and what better place than on a Twilight Zone episode.
I watched the show when it originally aired, but the stories are timeless and work just as well today.  It's hard to beat good writing, and Mr. Serling was a fantastic writer.",1433721600,,505,4.408602150537634

2177652,5,B00068NVMK,"There's just so many brilliant serials in every season of this, the benchmark anthology series of all time, but certainly the premiere season has its fair share.  Many of the season 1 episodes were Serling's teleplay adaptations of Matheson and other short stories, along with a few of his own.  ""Time Enough At Last"", ""What You Need"", ""The Hitchhiker"", ""The Monsters are Due on Maple Street"".  What amazes me is that no matter how often you watch these shows, they never become tiresome or seem dated.  Some of the finest dramatic actors along with wonderful sets.  I purchased the complete series on DVD when it was released some years back and it was beautifully done, but as that set is far away with my mom I'm very glad Amazon Prime includes these in its line-up.

If you are not acquainted with the series I must first ask what remote island have you been deserted on for the past 50 years, and then I will advise you to begin watching this series immediately.  When I found Twilight Zone on Amazon Prime Instant Video I got a little excited.  This is a series that I am wasn't even a glimmer in my father's eye when it first aired but, the first time I saw it I felt some kind of connection to the show.  If you are a lover of science fiction of the creepy kind or just the plainly bizarre then this media will keep you entertained for many hours.

Only some of the best story telling and twists that have ever been written for television. Give it a try you may be very surprised at how much you enjoy each episode. Watch many of the older stars today when they were young before they became famous. Among the most puke inducing words today is ""reality television"".

At times the 25-minute dramatizations can be very frightening, but there is generally no ""blood and guts"" horror. Rather, the stories can be terrifying the way the plight of the Morlocks is terrifying in H.G. Wells' ""Time Machine"". Some of the episodes veer into science fiction, and many concern the nature of the relationship between individuals and those in authority.  The series has worn well for the most part, although some references deal with specific concerns of the period, such as the cold war between the US/USSR and their respective allies.

2177956,5,B00068NVMK,Rod Serling was not only ahead of his time with his creation of The Twilight Zone; but he was a writing genius. He was also a true American patriot because he was not afraid (thru his episodes) to tackle some hard core issues of America in the 1960s. He was fair to everyone and fair in his episode presentation to every side of an American societal issue- not to mention that his episodes were also extremely entertaining.,1424390400,,423,4.5064935064935066

Lots of end-of-world, bleak, and uninspired writing.  I don't know why the creators of Twilight Zone were so very unhappy.  But generally, they are a bummer.  I do not recommend this program to anyone.  Even the famous William Shatner episode focuses on a strange cloud being attacking his airplane, and the Character Mr. Shatner plays is locked up as crazy.  Another example: a man gets all the time in the world to read all his favorite books, but then breaks his reading glasses - unable to read anything.

2178032,5,B00068NVMK,"I live in a small town about 30 miles from Indianapolis.  In the 50's and 60's, the only television stations were located in the big city and we snagged our signals out of the air with antennas mounted on metal poles at the side of our homes.  I mention this because the resulting signals that we viewed on our 19 inch black and white TV's was often snowy and sometimes faded in and out.

But we watched the Twilight Zone episodes with relish.  We loved the embedded moral lessons and the dramatic performances of budding actors of the time.  Watching these episodes on Amazon Prime is like taking a trip back in time to those simpler times when ""good"" and ""evil"" were seemingly easier to distinguish.

This is time well spent.",1417824000,,727,4.511450381679389

2178054,5,B00068NVMK,"Do not be fooled into looking at these episodes as science fiction or fantasy.  These are real  short stories, in the tradition of O Henry.  They have a plot, they often have a ""surprise"" ending, they often have a message with some substance and meaning.  Many focus on moral choices, the challenge of a person to ""do the right thing"", and they are busy observing and examining human behavior.  It is correct that in 26 minutes, there isn't much time for character development or great depth.  But they are shockingly deep for that amount of time.  The message gets across, even if it is not so developed.  This is just excellent storytelling, plain and simple.  Now, try and explain why it is entertaining to the average teen (or even adult) nowadays.  You will get nowhere.  There will be no appreciation for it, because these go back to a time when the world had the ability to stop and think and look for meaning, instead of having a 4 second attention span and an absolute disinterest in anything that requires thought to appreciate it.

2178095,5,B00068NVMK,Initial 'Twilight Zone' season. Fascinating and original series. Many well known Hollywood actors appear in leading roles. I even saw Ron Howard (billed as Ronnie Howard) in on one episode as a very little kid. Well worth sampling in it entirety. Episodes are 25 minutes long and video quality is excellent.,1413936000,,307,5.03921568627451
2178096,5,B00068NVMK,"Everyone in my generation grew up with the Twilight Zone, but as a kid I was more impacted by its eeriness than by anything else. Revisting these 30 minute episodes as a mature adult the eeriness is still there because of the musical score, the camera work, etc., but I was struck by the high level of moral and metaphysical message in the writing and the concepts found in almost every episode. Rod Serling truly was on the cutting edge of America's evolving ""New Age"" culture, which delves into the so-called supernatural and extraterrestrial, but rather than just titillate with terror, violence, weirdness, etc.,  The Twilight Zone always had a moral message, sometimes purely whimsical in its presentation, but many times a searing message comes with the Sci-Fi, pointing out man's weaknesses and vices, or strengths and courage, and what they inevitably bring as a result. The script was sometimes themed with references to current events, and always implemented so well, with the classic surprise at the end of the show that made it worth waiting for and wading through the commercials to get to, which, by the way, are not present in the Amazon prime versions of the show. It's hard to match the Twilight Zone for innovation, quality, excellent writing, and just pure entertainment.",1413849600,,1290,4.972222222222222

2178232,3,B00068NVMK,"I have vague memories of watching reruns of the original Twilight Zone as a child, so it's always been on my list of things to watch.  Now that I'm actually watching it, I find it doesn't live up to my nostalgic memories.  Maybe it's because I've read so much science fiction that by now most of the ideas seem old to me, or because after growing up to be a scientist I see all the bad science that was know by then to be nonsense.  It's still entertaining, I like noticing the episodes I saw as a child, and today it's fun to recognize many actors I've seen in other shows recorded in the 60's and 70's.  I also like that it's not as fast-paced as most modern shows, and not as singularly focused on pure visual appeal as many of them.  But I don't like that so many of the plots seem transparent, uninspired, or nonsensical.  (For example, -- SPOILER ALERT -- the first episode has an astronaut in training for a mission to the moon by testing a device to keep him sane in extreme isolation.  While we hadn't yet sent a man to the moon, we did have radio, so we knew he wouldn't have to be so extremely isolated.)",1404086400,,1115,4.206572769953052

2178243,5,B00068NVMK,"I love the Twilight Zone. While some (my Wife) say its creepy they really miss the whole point of many of the episodes. Some episodes are just 'fun' with little or no point but most have a theme - Good vs Evil, Dealing with Death, Men/woman down on their luck or troubled, The little guy vs the big guy, and End of the world. Serling's treatment often got controversial subjects past the overzealous censors of the day. Several episode have O'Henry-like endings which provides a real twist. A few episodes are just sentimental. While the writing makes the Twilight Zone one of the best one shouldn't forget the photography - Very good use of Black and White and its ability to set the mood. Many episodes have a definite 'film noir' quality although its 'science fiction and fantasy' not mystery and suspence. Still in some cases the mood and story lines mirror that of classic film noirs. Many of the shows require little or no special effects and yet are convincing when they do which is good since schlocky effects can ruin a story (but see below). For an anthology series it is hard to beat. Generally the quality of the shows is consistent although, of course, when there are as many shows in a season as there are, there are bound to be a few clunkers.

Another similar 60's show that has held us well is the 'Outer Limits'. While the latter's special effects are pretty schlocky it is a great show to watch. Actually, while pretty schlocky, I kind of enjoy the effects - classic Kitsch sci-fi effects! The point and the mood of the show is a little different from twilight Zone - but often the shows have a good theme or are just good science fiction. The 60's series is definitely worth watching. Surprisingly, the show was revived and ran for 6 or 7 seasons in the mid 90's. These new shows really capture the intent of the producers (who produced both series)  and are also great. The writing is very good and many of shows have very modern sci-fi themes which seem on the verge of becoming real.  The special effects for TV are fantastic and the revival really is worth watching.

2178245,5,B00068NVMK,"It never really could compare to the likes of today's CGI heavy serial shows, but Twilight Zone had/has something that today's shows severely lack... Writing!

Rod Serling was a master of being able to suspend belief for a few minutes and take a viewer to the Twilight Zone. His stories still hold a great fascination, deft slight of hand and overall quality that today's shows just don't have or writers today simply can't be bothered to take the time to instill in their product.

I have watched these shows for almost 35 years now and I am still pulled in and find myself trying to figure out the plot, to see if I missed clues to the final outcomes the previous 300x I have seen this particular episode! There is no blood... no gore... minimal violence, yet Serling can convey all the emotions from love to blind rage. He was truly a master of the small screen!

The acting is superb,  and they are able to tell great tales in only 25 mins. The production values, while dated now,  were done of the best of they're time during the early 60's.

2178256,5,B00068NVMK,"This is a great series because the writers figured out how to write for a half-hour time block. This was also before the assassination of the best president of modern times, John F. Kennedy. The country still retained a modicum of innocence as we still kept the front door unlocked. We still had the Cuban Missile Crisis to go through, we dealt with Cuba amicably and could still get the best cigar in the world for about $0.25. The Cold War was heating up and our enemy was Communism. We were heading to Viet Nam only to advise those without benefit of the lessons learned in the Korean Conflict and more distantly WWII.

In view of all this and what was to come, TV was still in its 'Golden Age' and was in 'high school' and rapidly growing up. TV for the most part was 'Slice of Life' and was like eating Comfort Food. The best part of The Twilight Zone was that it wasn't gory for gorys sake, it wasn't scary or crude like today's mainstream horror. We also had the benefit the television sensors, the guardians of America's good taste.

Mr. Serling hired writers who wrote short stories the way he taught writing. Grab the audience's attention immediately, and don't let go and with 5 minutes to go, throw in the twist of fate or place the wrinkle within the boundaries of good taste. I'd recommend The Twilight Zone to audiences of all ages as there is content still pertinent today. Some start out slow but if given a chance the viewer will be rewarded with a satisfying viewing experience.

I've seen the whole series all five seasons(mostly growing up)I remember the show in it's first run probably '64 or '65. This was around the time of other 1/2 shows like Gilligan's Island, Addams' Family, The Munsters and others. A lot of these shows started out Black and White, and turned into COLOR. As color technology got off the ground, shows were broadcast 'IN COLOR' and if you rich enough to own a color set, you saw it in color. If you still had the old Black and White technology, you still got to see the show, exactly as broadcast but only in Black and White. The show's producers would let everyone know that the show was in color by writing 'In Color' at the bottom of the screen and the announcer would say 'In Color'.

On a side note, as networks were want to do, as shows were canceled there was a dilemma as to what to replace them with. CBS in the 1963-64(4th season) season, had canceled a show. In order to keep costs down and to avoid show development of a new show, they allowed The Twilight Zone to fill the time. Now this kind of threw a monkey wrench into the works, as the show was very successful as a 30 minute show, now it would be an hour show. This placed a lot of pressure on the writers and Mr. Serling to stretch it out to an hour. As true to his word, Mr. Serling delivered the 4th Season as promised extended to an hour. As this formula was a dilution of the former format(though the hour shows were a bit tedious they never dipped into the unwatchable category.), it was agreed that the last season would return to the 30 minute format.

Mines are: The Lonely, the guy they gave a female robot on an asteroid, The Hitchhiker, with the lady who kept seeing the same hitchhiker on the road, The Fever, with a snotty old man who was too miserable to enjoy himself on a free casino vacation with his wife and ended up losing his damn mind on the slot machine, Elegy, with 3 astronauts who landed on a weird planet with a weird graveyard, Mirror Image, with a lady at a bus station who kept seeing herself, The Monsters are Due on Maple Street, with people bugging out on a power outage and a comic book story a boy told them, and more. Great stuff that will never stop entertaining. Rod Serling nailed it!",1402012800,,807,4.386666666666667
2178263,5,B00068NVMK,"Each episode is unique.  Fun to see actors you remember from the 50s, 60s and 70s.  Even though I've seen most of them through the years as reruns, they are still classics!",1401926400,,172,4.34375
2178264,5,B00068NVMK,Very good series with many young and soon to be famous actors in the episodes.  A classic that has yet to be equaled.,1401926400,,117,4.086956521739131

It's nice to watch these whenever I want and not having commercials is a big plus! :) Store them in your Cloud, so when you buy a new device you can transfer them over. Any fan of the Twilight Zone should get these. They didn't take up as much space as I thought they would either, so I will be purchasing and downloading the rest of them.",1401840000,,460,4.238636363636363
2178267,5,B00068NVMK,"The Twilight Zone lasted for 5 seasons, spanning 156 episodes, and it originally aired between October 2, 1959 and June 19, 1964. During the first three seasons (1959-62), it aired on Friday nights at 10:00pm EST. During the fourth season, it aired on Thursday nights at 9:00pm EST, and for its final season, it aired on Friday nights at 9:30pm EST.

The picture and sound of the HD versions are just simply clean and stunning.  The benefit here is not just the quality of resolution, it is that in modern times, cable/broadcast channels edit the episodes to allow for more commercials, deleting small (but sometimes important) scenes to make the episode fit a 30-minute time slot.  Here, they are not edited.  I can enjoy these seasons as they originally were made.

One of my favorite childhood memories was the family gathered around the TV for a nightly journey to that ""... signpost straight ahead""",1401753600,,903,4.837662337662338

2178278,5,B00068NVMK,"This is the quintessential TV series that is thought provoking and intriguing in the stories told in it's episodes.  Many of the actors ended up becoming major stars or were already major stars.  The biggest mistake that the network did was to cancel it.  The revived series not so long ago is better for production values, but the stories told in the original are still better.",1400630400,,378,4.696969696969697

An episode or two of The Twilight Zone is like a mug of hot cocoa: the perfect comfort entertainment. This review should be considered valid for any of TZ's seasons; they're all great! I decided to start with Season One and work my way forward. 16mm Shrine with Ida Lupino, Long Live Walter Jameson with Kevin McCarthy, and the classic Time Enough at Last with Burgess Meredith are among the standout episodes in Season One.

There will never be another show on like the Twilight Zone, for the shear simplicity of the Sci-Fi, fantasy and horror brought to life in your mind on a low budget can never be rivaled by the shear story telling impact. Known for Rod's quiet monologue setting the tone at the beginning and his epilogue at the end. Drama with an occasional wry twist of comedy and humor disguised as Sci-Fi.

The acting is good for the most part.  There is a lot of nostalgia in watching them and I think that is what attracted myself and my husband to the show; we both remember it from our childhood. I would recommend the show to others because even if some of the episodes seem repetitive, they are some very good ones.",1398902400,,479,4.074468085106383
2178297,3,B00068NVMK,I used to just love The Twilight Zone when I was a kid. Still interesting but somehow just don't seem quite as good. But still interesting and worth a look. Before everything was about sex and crime. Brings back some good memories.,1398902400,2,231,4.523809523809524

2178331,5,B00068NVMK,"I watched these as a child and loved them.  Going back to revisit many years later, they are still very enjoyable to watch, but with the added perspective to see and appreciate so much more.  For example, many stories have to do with outer space, the advancement of science, and fear of war.  After all, this was the space age, time of the Cold War, and post WWII.  The themes have to do with the human condition, and human needs, desires, and fears.  Mysterious and often spooky, some of the stories seem to have provided inspiration for later stories and movies by other writers.
The settings are very much of their time, 1959, and give a good look at American culture back then.  Yet the stories themselves are timeless.",1396396800,,723,4.565891472868217

2178389,5,B00068NVMK,As I'm sure like most people who decided to watch this I was a big fan of the series when it was originally  on TV in '59 and '60. I loved it then and while I do remember a few of the stories for some at least it is like seeing them for the first time. Each storyline itself is still great even if the sets and some of the acting is very dated.,1392854400,,344,3.6486486486486487
2178390,4,B00068NVMK,"Although some episodes are predictable now (70 years later!) many episodes are compelling and gripping. The acting holds up despite the amount of time that has passed. There are a few episodes that figure war prominently, both real wars and fictional ones. These give us a chance to look at those wars from a fresher perspective (e.g. WWII from the perspective of a writer in the fifties). Classic stuff.",1392854400,,404,4.869565217391305

2178395,5,B00068NVMK,I started watching it as these shows were made in the late 50's and early 60's.  What was science fiction then is sometimes reality now.  This was one of my favorite tv shows as I was growing up.,1392681600,,195,4.105263157894737
2178396,5,B00068NVMK,"I am not so old as to remember when the shows first aired, but I did grow up watching the reruns. These are just great shows that illustrate a time in history.

Sure, I already had that in me, but, Serling's goal was to push American society into serious reconsideration of what it took for granted as established order - ""...between the depths of man's fear and the summit of his knowledge."" - Serling's classic intro into each story.  Thanks Rod.  I'd love to see what he'd be writing today.

He features the stories of other authors along with his own in this Season 1 series.",1392595200,,782,4.857142857142857

2178402,5,B00068NVMK,"This series scared me 50 years ago, now I have nothing but admiration for Rod Serling, the creator and writer; brilliant and gone much too soon from lung cancer.

2178404,4,B00068NVMK,"I like watching streaming video on my Roku and Kindle Fire HD.  It is a great convenience without having to purchase the DVDs that might just sit around, and get misplaced, etc.  Twilight Zone still holds up to be very entertaining, and I still consider it one of the best Sci-Fi/Fantasy shows of all time.  It's great to watch them over and over again.

The only reason I gave this a 4-star instead of a 5-star rating is that when watching through a Roku on a standard television, the picture does not fill the screen.  Since this series was made for standard TVs the letter-box format does not make sense.  I would suggest that Amazon correct this.",1392336000,,650,4.512820512820513

2178406,5,B00068NVMK,"Considering these short episodes were written and produced in the 1950's, author and narrator Rod Serling certainly has a wild imagination and a very unique way of presenting his works.

Some of the best television writing ever. Seriously, I'm not being exaggeratory.  Serling and Matheson. Just amazing. Serling was cut from the most special cloth to be able to create what he did...Weekly. He wrote 75% of all five seasons episodes. The man was a writing prodigy. Most importantly, these stories still hold up today. i work in a very political environment, where people slow destroy each other preemptively out of fear - usually because of their differences. It makes me want to put up a street post that reads ""Maple Street"", in my cube, which is why I want to be dropped off by my bus in Willoughby. Also, I Shot an Arrow into the Sky is great too.

From Ida Lupino, Burgess Meredith, Claude Akins, Jack Albertson, Robert Redford, Sebastian Cabot, Robert Duvall, Peter Falk and hundreds more.  Many of them with links to other shows during the 60's and movies prior (and after) the series.

2178465,5,B00068NVMK,"a dimension not only of sight and sound but of mind; a journey into a wondrous land whose boundaries are that of imaginationyour next stop, the Twilight Zone!"" Rod Serling
I don't think any review can be made without knowing something about Rod himself. He started out in radio where he had a strong interest as a helper doing small tasks, but learned how things worked, WW-2 started, and he enlisted. He was a member of the 11th Airborne PIR. He wanted to serve in Europe against the nazis, but instead was deployed to the Pacific Theater, where he first saw heavy action in the liberation of the Philippines; his unit often had casualty rates of 50%. He ended the war with a Purple Heart and Bronze Star, and the war deeply affected him [and his writing] the rest of his life. After the war he went to college where he not only started as a broadcaster, but a freelancer as a writer for radio programs-but due to industry wide lawsuits involving alleged stolen storylines, he was always turned down for, ""heavy competition, lack of professional quality"" or some other reason. In 1950 he sold his first piece that was nationally broadcast, and worked as a staff writer producing both radio and TV scripts. He later said this was a huge mistake because once you come up with an idea and its used, it can never go on again. ""You can't afford to give away ideas  they're too damn hard to come by. If I had it to do over, I wouldn't staff-write at all."" He felt radio was not right for him and moved into TV. He had at one time 40 rejected radio scripts, so he rewrote them for TV and they started to sell. In 1955 he wrote a script for nationwide Kraft Television Theater called, ""Patterns,"" broadcast live. It took the nation by storm. Just one example of a critic:Robert Lewis Shayon stated in the Saturday Review, ""in the years I have been watching television I do not recall being so engaged by a drama, nor so stimulated to challenge the haunting conclusions of an hour's entertainment."" There was such a popular demand that it was rebroadcast live a month later (most programs weren't filmed.) From then on he never lacked work but had to contend with corporate censorship, so frustrated, he decided to start his own show. In 1958 the first program he submitted to CBS entitled, ""The Time Element"" was to be the first for his new weekly show, ""The Twilight Zone."" It was produced by Desilu, and shown on Westinghouse Playhouse. It received such audience acclaim CBS agreed to go ahead with his pilot, and in 1959, ""The Twilight Zone"" was born.
He managed to maintain creative control, and wrote a large number of the scripts {92} often drawing on his own life experiences, along with hiring writers Charles Beaumont and Richard Matheson. The show incorporated his views on society veiled in science fiction and fantasy, some tales light hearted, some dark, but all with a twist, unique-there is no such thing as a bad episode, and they are as timeless today as then. As a creative work it can stand on its own. Serling's work has the sheer power of narrative, forcefulness of characterization, and brilliant climax (there is no let down.) Genius is a word often overused, and some people do achieve a moment of it. Serling is consumed with it, and each episode of, ""The Twilight Zone"" is inspired by some emotional truth or statement regarding the human condition. You will meet everything from angels to demons, laugh, have tears run down your face, watch the shadows and dark, but you will never be bored. This is season one {throughout the series you will recognize many actors who will become famous later} and one episode, No. 27, ""The Big Tall Wish,"" (Requiem For a Heavyweight) a little boy tells the fighter, ""for magic to work you have to believe;"" later after the story's twist, as he's telling the little boy good night he says, ""maybe magic doesn't work because enough people don't believe in it"" (you'll understand.) This episode won a Peabody Award for best quality.

The movie sets have all changed but many of them can still be recognized from modern films.  I especially enjoyed the scenes from Las Vegas in ""The Fever"".

I admired his willingness to take on the Corporate bullies of his day -- they are still with us unfortunately -- to champion good acting, good stories, and no nonsense entertainment.  He thought that the ""dumbing down"" of Americans using ""SitComs"" was a bad idea.

Just pure unadulterated spookiness and unsubtle social commentary without the ice, mixers, garnish, special guest appearances, or commercial breaks. Well, maybe a word or two from our sponsor before the chain-smoking Rod Serling tosses out a teaser about next week's episode. Good Lord, he might even mention the name of the writer! That's the way it was in '50s/'60s TV. And Twilight Zone was among the best of the lot. Still is.

Go ahead. Treat yourself to a marathon of little boys wishing their enemies into the corn field, nuclear worldwide war paranoia, troubled men longing for bygone days of idyllic youth, and troubled women longing for -- or desperate to avoid -- perverted beauty. You may never want to get on a plane again. Even the devil himself-- well, I won't spoil it for you.

The episodes appear in their original broadcast order. For my money, the best years were the first season and the fourth (the only hour-long episodes), but feel free to disagree. Yeah, there are a few clunkers in there, but go ahead and buy all five seasons. You know you want to.",1388448000,,1122,4.690355329949239

Watching the show intentionally, I noticed something that I'd never thought of before.  Special effects were extremely limited by the budget and technology of the time.  Watching these episodes I was able to focus more on the acting and story.  Sometimes an episode focuses on a single emotion, sometimes on a complex issue.  Earl Holliman running around a deserted town looking for any person at all, shouting ""Where is everybody?!"" and later discovering it was all in his mind as part of an astronaut isolation experiment.

Maybe the black and white makes it cheesy to some, the aliens looking like a ""My Favorite Martian"" character, an obvious lack of modern special effects, but these kids learn so much more than just reading-a-script vs. watching the show.

I enjoyed seeing things like the old typewritter, not even electric (these old ones had a really hard touch). The phone booth, the old phones. Then there was the drug store complete with books and the malt shope. Is that what small towns were really like? With a list of the members of the Basketball team on the counter at the drug store. Only ONE high school in the entire place? It reminds me of a Normal Rockwell painting. You could just imagine the high school kids sitting on the stools slurping down a malted or sharing a hot fudge Sunday.

Spoilers...

Also, imagine, just ten years later and we actually did land on the Moon. Sometimes I forget that before that event, we could still imagine there were other creatures up there. Before the vast expanse of knowlege which has happened in such a short period of time...we thought the earth at least was permanent.

Now we know that even the Universe will end someday. And have not found life anywhere but on Earth. Talk about feeling isolated and alone....

It was also  fun seeing the old actors. The main character was in 'Police Woman', the General guy was in 'My Favorite Martian', and I recognized another man but couldn't place him.",1387497600,,1419,4.58893280632411

There's nothing frightening here, or even very creepy, but every episode is thought-provoking.  They also tend to end on some sort of twist.  Some of the twists you don't see coming, but the ones that get me are the episodes where you see the twist from ""a mile away"" and are sitting there thinking, ""No, don't do that to them, Rod!""",1386374400,,462,4.275862068965517

The show was ground-breaking and original, delving into fantasy, horror and science fiction in ways that had never been tried before. Rod Serling's fantastic writing and memorable voice made the show what it was, and they found a wealth of fine actors to bring the stories to life.

I saw the show when it first aired, and was surprised at the number of shows I remembered, since I was only nine at the time. What I didn't remember was that this first season did not have the legendary theme song everyone associates with the show. The music they did have was moody and fit the original narration, it just wasn't ""The"" theme.

The stories just get better and better---can't imagine anyone not having seen them so if you're finding them for the first time, look out!  You'll be sucked in and addicted in no time!  Serling's stories are a fabulous mix of morality tale, sci fi, fantasy, nightmare...can see how the likes of the X-Files naturally evolved from the Zone.  Wonder if Stephen King would consider his work to be rooted in them, too...  Great American Originals!!!  I only put four stars on it because it's for the first season---there are some rough eps here...but overall, I give full series five stars!",1383004800,,733,4.716535433070866

So many were more humorous than scary but I still feel a little creeped out when I hear the opening music. I watch modern horror movies and laugh (which does cause concern in others) but I feel the vicarious thrill in anticipation of being scared watching these shows approved by the censors of the time.,1382918400,,481,4.415730337078652

I have enjoyed watching all these episodes so many times.  There are some television shows that will always remain classic and dear to us and for me Twilight Zone is one of them.

It is surprising in retrospect how well done the episodes are for a weekly TV series. They used great TV actors who went on to become big name stars and the writing is superb. These stories make you think about human nature. I also love that I can watch them for free with Amazon Prime without commercials.

2178648,5,B00068NVMK,"Many Scifi shows that came after Mr. Serling had created this monstrous hit attempted to do what he had done. Though some of those attempts were good, like the Outer Limits, none ever were able to match the Twilight Zone for its originality, creativity, ability to get right inside of the viewer's head. Many of his shows brings to life many ideas that others have thought. Many just did not have the guts to express them to others. It brought out fears of what the future may turn out to be, or what an alien encounter may look and feel like. And yes, as you watched these programs you FELT them as well. You became emotionally involved and attached to the characters.

Looking back, it is amazing at how many later-to-be stars were on these shows. And some that were already known to be stars as well. His appeal reached far and wide to every social-economic class.

Its the most fascinating experience watching these shows, since for the most Ive not seen most of these for eons  if, indeed I saw them at all.

The real alien ship showed up near the Breainerd area just like in the Twilgjht Zone show.  The only difference is that the real aliens from space sent me a chemical formual on my chat. I think it something about reducting air poluction. The real alien ship travels at very high speeds faster then the human eyes can see. It travels very smoothly thru the air. It's amazing that it can actually pinpint my exact location on the ground. Back in 1980s some government agency was broadcasting about how each alien ship engine is manufactured. This real Brainerd Alien ship actually saved my life by sending me right to the front door of some indian in the brainerd area when I was upset about people giving me a very hard time, I had walked about thirteen miles during the winter, it was very cold, down south of town about thirteen miles to get my stress reduced. I got cold and received directions on which house to go to. I walked right up to the door of this house and the Indian guy let me right in to warm up. The Indian said ist was really weird how the dog did  not bark at all. What I thought was weird was the fact that the dog seemed exactly like a dog that I use to have when I was young. The dog kept me warm while I was waiting for someone to pick me back up and take me back home. I sure wish earth  people would treat me as good as the real space aliens do.

Highly recommended to everyone who remembers this series when it was first on and even more highly recommended to younger folks who want to see some great actors and actresses in their youths.,1371081600,,278,4.58
2178795,5,B00068NVMK,"Although I was just out of my toddler years when the first season aired I became a huge fan of Twilight Zone as the years passed.  My wife has joined me as a fan.  We even spent one memorable holiday weekend watching a Twilight Zone marathon on TV when we had nothing else to do while she was in the hospital.

I was thrilled to see the full seasons available on Amazon Prime.  We loaded them all into our Prime watchlist to view on our Roku and her Kindle.  We started by watching Season 1.  Even with all the time we spent watching Twilight Zone over the decades there have been several episodes from season 1 that we had never seen!  Talk about an unexpected gift from the past.  Yes, Twilight Zone has a dated and aged feel in many episodes, demonstrating a general misunderstanding of distances involved in space travel, but Rod Serling was a man ahead of his time visualizing and scripting the emerging science fiction genre.",1371081600,,931,4.4674556213017755
2178796,5,B00068NVMK,"I'm old enough to remember watching Twilight Zone when it was first-run TV, and unlike many shows of that era, Twilight Zone is just as good today as it was then.  Taking just a simple idea and spinning it into a half hour show with a twist at the end, it keeps you engaged.  Production values are not exceptionally high but are good, and the acting, casting and writing are excellent.  I can get started watching these and just keep going, like potato chips.
Not everyone is a fan of the Twilight Zone sci-fi type drama, but if you are, and you like one, chances are you'll like them all.",1370995200,,589,4.336363636363636

Quality of the picture is really good, especially in HD.",1370044800,,167,4.25
2178806,5,B00068NVMK,"Outstanding show that was well ahead of its time when it debuted in 1959, and that still - for the most part - holds up today, largely due to quality writing and excellent Golden Age of Television actors in the early stages of their careers.  In addition, some of Hollywood's best musical talent scored the episodes, and the black-and-white photography of the era adds to the overall effect.  These Blu-Ray transfers are excellent: crisp; clear; drawing out the the best in shadow that subtly reinforces the overall theme of a place between ""substance and shadow"" alluded to in the opening credits.  The fact that Amazon Prime members can view these episodes for free goes a long way (in my book anyway) toward justifying the $79 annual cost for the service, but to get the full treatment - including audio commentaries; additional video clips; Rod Serling's rarely aired pilot ""Time Element""; etc., you'll need to purchase the DVD set.  Either way, invest a rainy afternoon in watching (or ""re-watching"" if you're a Boomer like me) some of the best television ever filmed.  It's just sad that while Technology has evolved, the quality of much of modern television has spiraled downward into the gutter.  They just don't make 'em like this anymore.",1370044800,,1248,4.919047619047619

Once you start you will want to watch the entire season. The waiting time to get this set was well worth it. Amazon once again did great with the packaging and shipping, Prime is the way to go.

His Twilight Zone series was a first in made-for-TV scifi and created a surreal world that challenged the imagination of his viewers. Many of the programs were socially minded, since he was interested in topics like the Nazi  persecution of the Jews, what loneliness to the extreme can do to one's mind, and alien encounters with a unique twist. His use of camera angles to create an inner ""point of view"" from the perspective of the lead character was amazing. Anyone who enjoys science fiction will enjoy this series.

She is hit with reality when asked to play the role of a mother. She refuses to accept her age time and time again.

The cinematography, acting, and writing were all top notch. She is very believable and kept me wondering what was next.

The ending of the episode with the interplay between the characters and Rod Serling is wonderful, funny, and incredibly unique!

The episode may be dated, but further evidence of how Twilight Zone episodes were so incredibly ahead of their time in stories of irony, fantasy, and science fiction.

2178970,5,B00068NVMK,"This is the pilot episode of The Twilight Zone, and it really set the tone for the rest of the series. No shows before this were as clever, and most TV entertainment was very straightforward. Rod Serling had a different approach and it changed TV forever.

SPOILER ALERT: Stop reading if you haven't watched the episode.

What makes this episode so brilliant is the fact that it came out before we had even landed on the Moon. The struggled with traveling to other planets and moons seemed to be that we couldn't build a ship that could propel us out of the atmosphere and sustain a human life in the process.

But Rod Serling was thinking about the psychological effects of space travel. We are now at a time, 50 years later, when we are trying to explore Mars. One of the big challenges of sending human beings to Mars is the fact that it is a long trip, and the astronauts will be isolated and not able to fully socialize. This is exactly what Rod Serling was foreseeing when he wrote this episode, and it just shows how truly remarkable his mind was.",1345075200,,1054,4.422680412371134

This first season is now in Blu-Ray format and while not every episode looks great on 1080p due to the various states of deterioration of the original master tapes they are certainly a whole lot better than the dvds.  The sound quality for the most part has been cleaned up and hisses are few and far between.  What I like about the Twilight Zone is that I never seem to tire of watching the episodes over and over again as I always seem to find something new that I missed on previous times.  Not all the episodes in this first season score but the ones I liked the most are: ""The Lonely"", ""Perchance To Dream"", ""And When the Sky Was Opened"", ""Third From the Sun"", ""The Hitch-Hiker"", ""The Last Flight"", ""A World of Difference"", ""People Are Alike All Over"", ""Nightmare As A Child"" and ""A Stop At Willoughby"".

While most episodes have excellent picture and sound quality, a few are not so well transferred but overall this is a very good blu-ray set of season one of the series.

I previously owned the Definitive Collection of this series but sold it when I purchased this set. The video and audio are fantastic and definitely an upgrade from the Definitive Edition.

I do have one minor issue with this set that I cannot seem to figure out. It appears the framing is off to sum up  the problem. It appears it is framed in 1:31:1 as compared to 1:33:1. The pillars on the side are larger in width than other 1:33:1 blu-rays (i.e. Star Trek TOS, It's a Wonderful Life, etc.). This seems very strange to me and it makes me wonder if cropping is occurring along the sides. FYI... I have tested this set on two blu-ray players on two different TVs so I know it's not my equipment. I was wondering if anyone else has noticed this as well. I also find it odd that none of the professional reviewers have mentioned this issue. I wish I still had my Definitive Edition so I could do a comparison between the two sets.

Overall I highly recommend this set but I am dinging it one star for the framing issue I mentioned in my review. Hopefully someone else can comment on this possible issue.",1330732800,2,1205,4.323008849557522

I love Twilight Zone.  This is not one of my favorite episodes though because almost all of it is done with only one character.  That's a personal preference on my part.  My favorite episodes tend to have three or more characters.

The acting and directing is excellent.  A theme about survival and rules is explored.  Twilight Zone frequently used the subject of astonauts, reflecting the concerns and outlook of the time, 1960.

You can hardly find entertainment like this without going back to 1960.  There is no canned laughter, special effects, rapid-fire screen shots or product advertising in the segment.  It's thoughtful.  Compared to what we're used to now, it feels a little slow-moving and more like live theater.

Before TV gave way to the repetitiveness of Gilligan's Island, Get Smart, Bewitched and other shows that reused the same plot lines and main characters that never seemed to change (unless threatened by cancelation), TV had anthology shows and great actors who really wanted to be there.

2178978,5,B00068NVMK,"I've been a fan of The Twilight Zone ever since I saw William Shatner's classic performance in Nightmare at 20,000 Feet. Normally, I'm skeptical about older shows being remastered like this for Blu-ray, but overall, I'm pretty impressed. In a nutshell, here's what I think about The Twilight Zone on Blu-ray.

GOOD
- the quality of the transfers look very impressive in HD, there's no artifacts or other anomologies sometimes seen in the DVD version
- the audio tracks have been restored and remastered and they give a lot of new depth to some of the classic episodes
- a nice collection of episodes that still stand the test of time
- great extras are included, including interviews and other behind the scenes bits

BAD
- the set can be kinda pricey, so shop around for the best deal
- some have complained of playback issues on this set, so make sure your blu-ray drive has the latest firmware updates

Even if you have these on regular DVD, I realize that it can be daunting to buy another series AGAIN, just to have it in HD, but trust me, it's worth it.",1326326400,2,1059,4.505208333333333

The restoration and clarity... the artistic aspect of the black and white and the shadows is just pure classic artwork.  I'm on the 2nd disc of Season 1, and I stumbled on an episode that I don't recall ever seeing before:  ""The Four Of Us Are Dying"".  About a con man who can change his face to look like anyone using nothing but his ability of total facial muscle control.  The LOOK of the episode is pure Jazz ""neon"" film noir artwork! with a soundtrack and feel that you just don't hear or see anymore.
Jerry Goldsmith did the score.  The Blu-Ray gives you the option of isolating just the music score.  Nice jazz!  Interlaced with the episodic music of the drama that's taking place throughout it.  So good, that the silent breaks only emphasize how great the music is when it comes back.
This set is well deserved of major awards.
I recommend watching it with the subtitles on.  It adds an emphasise to Rod Serlings literary depth during his narrations that just makes me laugh out loud from pure delight of enjoyment.",1325894400,,1202,4.393665158371041

I didn't bite on ""The Definitive Edition"", so I can't compare against it, but I just had to get the Blu-ray. The main difference is that the old collection transfers are very contrasty (not much detail in shadows especially) and the picture is just plain old 480 lines of resolution. The Blu-ray is amazing both in the incredible detail that resulted from remastering to 1080 lines, the dynamic range (detail in shadows, lovely black and white), and the vastly improved sound along with the image clarity (abscence of significant noise).

As such, these reviews are out of date and many are flat out innacurate. I should know. I had my disc 4 replaced after it stopped working when I had to switch out a BD-rom drive.

I like to put these dvds on and work with my computer while watching them but it bugs me that I have to reset them at the end of every ep. It probly sounds lazy to some people but I just don't like using the dang remote so much to reset it every 20 - 30 minutes. What is so hard about including a ""play all"" option? Just my 2 cents.",1318118400,3,478,3.8877551020408165
2178986,5,B00068NVMK,"I'm not going into detail about each of the episodes, many of which are so a part of our national cultural heritage, that I feel as if I would be describing wind or rain. It's something that everyone knows about, whether they love it or not. The show has been an inspiration for many movies, old and current. The writing is excellent, and the drama can be both intense and entertaining. Each episode a look into our mortality and our morality. So with that being said, I would like to just say to those people who are thinking of buying the series, but are not sure in which format to purchase it, this is worth every penny. I had been looking for complete seasons of the Twilight Zone for  years, but it was quite some time before the chronological sets came out. But then Blu Ray/HD happened, and I was waiting to see what would become of the show in High Definition. Like Star Trek the original series, this set is so well put together it staggers the mind and the imagination. I can not even think of anything they could have done better. The Extras are awesome, the original ads/billboards put the show in a historical context. The Video presentation has never looked better. Blu Ray seems to enhance it rather than reveal the flaws. I'm glad I waited for this set. Forget the dvds buy this on Blu Ray and if you don't own a blu ray player yet, get one. This set is worth it. I also like the bonus features, as they seem to capture the moment in time in which they were made. Blu Ray gives them the option to not only present the best audio/video but to also give you as many extras as they can think of. Unlike the episodes though, some of those extras are not in pristine condition, as they are very old and we are probably very lucky that they even still exist, but it's great to watch, and the radio plays are great as well. I can not recommend this any higher. Rod Serling was a brilliant writer, and a great narrator. The shows come to live in a way that you can not even imagine until you see it, while still maintaining the intergrity of the show, and not harming the charm/nuances of the show. Everything will be as you remembered it, only better. It is almost like when you look back in time at something you loved to watch, only you don't see it how it was then, as your love for the show has grown over the years, so you see it as something even grander, only in this case, the Twilight Zone meets and exceeds those high, normally unobtainable, expectations. I used to watch this show while I was growing up, as I have always loved Science Fiction. I love the idea of taking modern themes and putting them in a sci fi setting. as sci fi has always been the best way to scrutinize the complexities of man, his ideals, his dreams, and his shortcomings. And, then package it in such a way as to give us objective distance. While there are morals to the stories, it's never in your face to make you feel ashamed if you are like the characters in the story, but makes you think of how you might look to other people. Everyone can relate to the Twilight Zone because it is more or less a mirror reflected inward. We get to see mankind as is, with no sugar coating, but with enough subtlety as to not make you defensive, but rather it helps you explore the very nature of who we are. That's what Science Fiction is to me, and when it works best, as in The Twilight zone,you don't even realise that you've learned something until you are thinking about it's questions and premises at later moments. So anyone who just loves great storytelling should buy this, even if you are not into science fiction or old shows that are b/w. Watch these shows and you will see what television was in its prime. No reality shows, no Snooki, no american idol. Just Great Writing with great Presentation. You won't be disappointed.",1317945600,13,3823,4.346853146853147

2178989,5,B00068NVMK,"Just a heads up to those unsuspecting purchasers of this  Blu-ray disc version,  the aspect ratio is 1.33:1.  This means that your 16:9 HDTV will play the disc with  bars at either side of the screen to make up for the missing width of the image. This is referred to as pillar boxing or vertical letterboxing.

While I suppose one becomes accustomed to viewing the episodes in this restricted mode, it is confounding to  invest in a widescreen  HDMI  SONY and then play an expensive  Blu-ray disc where the  third of the screen is covered with black bars at the sides. While the bars at the top and bottom for  1.78:1, 1.85:1, or 2.39:1, aspect ratio Blu-ray discs or DVD's is a bargain trade off for the complete image,  not seeing the screen filled playing these expensive discs, as opposed to seeing a full screen image when viewing TZ reruns on the Sci-Fi channel, is rather disappointing.

On the subject of Marc Scott Zicree's contributions to the Blu-ray TZ special features:

While the quality of the Blu'ray discs are all that one could hope for,  author of ""The Twilight Zone Companion,"" Marc Scott Zicree's voice over  commentaries regarding Rod Serling have a lot to be desired.  On the discs,  Zicree  is intent on characterizing Serling as some sort of  1960's liberal icon. who despised Hitler and McCarthy (but apparently not Stalin and Khruscheve)  and supported MLK  and civil rights. The  impression one derives from this editorializing is that liberals  had  a  monopoly on supporting equality, civil rights and  the  trepidation of all out nuclear war.

Regarding the episode ""the Whole truth,""  Zicree  writes in his book that Serling , "" was not immune to some of the most pervasive prejudices of the day.""  This is a rebuke  of Serling  for singling out  Soviet Prime Minister Nikita Khruschev as a  totalitarian leader with a problem for telling the truth.  Why does Zicree consider  Serling's  condemnation of  Khruschev and communism  a form of ""prejudice?'  Apparently, this Rod Serling is in conflict with his ideal Rod Serling, who  objected to McCarthy and the Hollywood blacklist.  Perhaps Serling 's politics are  not so easily pigeonholed as Zicree would like us to believe.

Another instance of Serling's  disharmony with Zicree's  notion of liberalism was apparent when he taught  film classes in the 1960's. Serling felt a stronger rapport with older students in his evening classes than he did with the counter-culture of the day. This observation was made in Bob Rosenbaum's  1987article,  ""Life With Rod: A conversation with Carol Serling",1308009600,8,2578,4.948235294117647

I had this collection on my wish list and my son bought it for me for Christmas.  It was my best Christmas present, and the finest Blu-Ray collection I own.

I also own the Definitive Edition DVD set, and this totally blows it away in terms of quality.  If I can point to one scene that would demonstrate the detail that you can see with this edition, check out ""And When the Sky Was Opened"" and go to the scene where the airman breaks into the bar after closing time.  Before he breaks the glass, you can see the wavy lines in the glass....it's stunt glass, or candy glass!  I don't think I had ever noticed that in all the times I had watched the episode in its previous incarnations.

Sounds good.

Treasure trove of bonus features. It's great to hear Serling trash his own work in the audio from the Sherman Oaks course. You can actually hear him smoking!

BUT...

The Blu-ray logistics don't appear to be quite right. I purchased this item this week and have only tried disc 1. When you play an episode with commentary activated, there's no way to play it without that commentary. Unless you activate a different commentary or audio mix. But once one alternate audio track has been activated for an episode, there is no option to watch the episode ""clean."" It latches on to that alternate audio and won't let go. Unless you go back to the main menu and then turn off the BD player, then turn it back on again.

Am I using an old, out-of-date BD player? Nope. Panasonic DMP-BDT350 with the latest firmware update.

I hope Image Entertainment isn't planning a 2013 release: ""The Twilight Zone Definitive Blu-ray Series With Correctly Working Menus/Special Features"" in hopes of more re-buys.",1295654400,3,1019,4.827586206896552
2178999,5,B00068NVMK,"I've been holding off writing this review for awhile, mainly because I've been hoping (yes, hoping) that I would finally receive a set in which all five discs would load and play in either of my Blu-ray players. That has not happened. Yesterday, I received the fourth set, and once again, disc four will not load. Thanks to Amazon making it so easy to send merchandise back, I've been trying repeatedly, hoping a copy my players would read would arrive. But that's it....I've given up now and will send this one back soon.

After reading many of the negative comments regarding playability here, I have an idea of what happened. When Image created the Blu-ray masters for this set, they didn't use a good ""player standard"" or set of files that would work with all available players. That is the only explanation I can think of for some people's sets to work right away, for others to have issues until a firmware upgrade, and for some to have discs which just won't load.  For the record, both my Panasonic and Sharp players have the latest firmware, and I have yet (after the purchase of 100+ Blu-rays) to have any other Blu-rays not load and/or play.

In the meantime, I've watched bits of the first disc and must agree with the positive reviews a lot of folks have left here. The image quality is amazing, and the wealth of additional extra features makes the upgrade worth it (if you have the standard definition, which I already do). Therefore, I'm giving three stars....I don't want an overly negative review to pull down the rating of a fantastic series, but I cannot positively review something I'm not able to watch in its entirety. Three stars....five for the show, minus two stars for Image's negligence in encoding (and not standing up and addressing the issue).

I will not order another set (or any other season) until Image has addressed and stated that they have corrected this problem. I'll stay with the standard definition set for now.

UPDATE (4/8/2011): Well, so much for the previous paragraph's statement about not ordering another one until Image addresses the issue.....thanks to Justin Playfair's review stating that the problem seems to be resolved, I ordered another one....and yes, all discs load and appear to play fine!! Obviously, the problem disc's master files have been corrected. There have been no recent firmware upgrades to my system; it was indeed a disc construction issue. Just make sure you order a new one, if you want to insure playability! I'll go to five stars now....even though Image (who I know have had financial trouble) should've been up front with people about this issue.",1294790400,8,2626,4.8137472283813745

2179005,5,B00068NVMK,"I was excited to get this blu-ray set when it was first announced; but then, after it was released, I hesitated to buy it for two reasons:  the $70 price tag and the reviews from people who had trouble with discs not loading in their players.

I greatly rely on customer reviews when I purchase from Amazon, so after reading both positive and negative comments, I convinced myself to wait for Image (the blu-ray producer) to recall the set and re-release it someday, especially since I couldn't justify paying the $70 for it anyway.

Then, after Christmas 2010, ""TZ Season 1"" went on sale for about $48--still pricey but a little more affordable for my budget.  I was tempted so much that I began re-reading the reviews and comments to see if any of the supposed bugs were still occurring.  I came across one posting that recommended updating your blu-ray player's firmware so that it could handle this set's content-heavy discs.  I saw that as a possible solution to what seemed to be occurring with folks.  So, I took a chance and bought the Season 1 set at the sale price.  As I waited for it to arrive, I was hopeful but still concerned that the discs wouldn't work on my blu-ray player, even if I could figure out how to update my firmware.  But because of Amazon's great return policy, I felt reassured that if I couldn't make it work, I could always send it back.

I had never updated my Sony BDP-S350 before and didn't know how to do it (it's not hooked up to my Internet so it doesn't update automatically), so I went to the Sony web site, carefully followed the instructions, downloaded the latest firmware update for my player, and then burned the update files to a CD-R.  I put the CD-R in my blu-ray player and let it run its course.  To my surprise (I don't have a lot of luck with fixing things), after about 15 minutes it seemed to have worked.  The message from the blu-ray player on my TV screen said that its firmware was updated.

I received the set in the mail and then carefully placed each disc in my player.  I anxiously waited while I heard the low hum of my machine reading the high-def data on discs 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.  Lo and behold, each disc loaded within seconds.  With much happiness and relief, I was taken to the main menu screens on all the discs.  To continue my test, I selected an episode on each menu and sampled a few minutes of several shows, smiling that it was working and that the episodes looked and sounded wonderful.  I didn't mind this stop in The Twilight Zone at all!

My experience should convey 1) the importance of Amazon's reviewers (they swayed my opinion regarding wanting the set [those who had working discs raved about its quality], holding off on buying the set because of the loading problems, and finding a solution to the apparent problems), and 2) the affordability of something being a huge determining factor in purchasing it (I never would've taken the chance on buying the set had it not been on sale).

I look forward to watching this first season of one of my favorite shows and someday picking up the other seasons (provided they're on sale).

Thank you all for your help, and if you are wavering in your decision on buying this set, I would urge you to add it to your shopping cart (provided you have the latest firmware for your blu-ray player and that you think it's affordable).",1294185600,16,3349,4.473684210526316

Because Rod Serling's groundbreaking show was originally shot on 35MM film, there are pristine camera negatives from which to derive exceptional 1080p digital transfers.  You will be amazed at the clarity and sharpness of these memorable black and white fables.  Back in the day, a full TV season amounted to 36 shows.  Every episode is crafted like a fine short story often with a twist ending.  Many of the stand-alone half-hour (actually about 24 minutes) stories often provokes with a moral stance.  In fact, some of them are memorable more as parables than sci-fi or fantasy tales.

Packed with wonderful new bonus features that include the extremely rare, never before officially released unofficial hi-def pilot episode ""The Time Element,"" written by Serling and hosted by Desi Arnez.

The iconic episodes in this initial season have titles that may jog a memory.  They are: Denton on Doomsday, The Sixteen Millimeter Shrine, Walking Distance, Escape Clause, The Lonely, Time Enough at Last, Perchance to Dream, Judgment Night, And When the Sky Was Opened, What You Need, The Four of Us Are Dying, Third from the Sun, I Shot an Arrow into the Air, The Hitch-Hiker, The Fever, The Last Flight, The Purple Testament, Elegy, Mirror Image, The Monsters Are Due on Maple Street, A World of Difference, Long Live Walter Jameson, People Are Alike All Over, Execution, The Big Tall Wish, A Nice Place to Visit, Nightmare as a Child, A Stop at Willoughby, The Chaser, A Passage for Trumpet, Mr. Bevis, The After Hours, The Mighty Casey, A World of His Own.

Some of the stars featured in these classic episodes: Anne Francis, Burgess Meredith (eventual veteran of numerous TZ episodes), Ida Lupino, Jack Klugman, Richard Conte, Gig Young, Nehemiah Persoff, Sebastian Cabot, Claude Akins, Earl Holliman, Roddy McDowall, Kevin McCarthy, Ed Wynn, Murray Hamilton, Vera Miles and Ron Howard.  Some of them participate in the fascinating commentary tracks of select episodes.

While the first season was still on the air, it was widely hailed a critical and popular success.  Daily Variety said: ""...the best that has ever been accomplished in half-hour filmed television.""  Fifty-one years later, that still holds true.  This is one for the library that, like a volume of great short stories, you will return to savor again and again.",1290297600,3,2495,5.080882352941177

I do intend to buy this series as a complete Blu set, but have been putting it off due to a few reasons. One of these reasons is that I almost wanted to test the series against my childhood memories of Serling and Company: Is it really that fantastic a show, or am I remembering it, still, as a ten year old would have been duly impressed? Well, it's that fantastic a show. I started with the first season not because I want to buy the seasons in order, but because more than a few of my favorite episodes are on it. These include the original series pilot, ""Where Is Everybody?"", with Earl Holliman (Some critics continue to say that the script is clunky with Earl, being the only human being onscreen for 95% of the episode, having to explain the action by 'talking outloud to himself', but I thought it worked); ""Walking Distance"" with the wonderful Gig Young, ""The Sixteen Millimeter Shrine"" with the amazing Ida Lupino as an aging actress who wants to literally and figuratively disappear into her cinematic glories of yesteryear, and ""A Passage For Trumpet"", with Jack Klugman and John Anderson. Really, it would be easier to note the throwaways of this season than the homeruns, because the astonishing first season also has the winners, ""The Hitchiker"" (which absolutely terrified me as a kid, and still is wonderfully creepy),""The Purple Testament"", ""A Stop At Willoughby""...you get the idea. Just a fantastic first year's offering, with little false starts or stumbling. I usually don't care for TZ's attempt at humor, but even this season's closer, ""A World of His Own"" is perfect, with Keenan Wynn as a writer whose character literally shuts Serling and the set down until Season 2. The quality of the set's transfer is an A; I see nothing to really complain about other than every now and then, there's a blip in the audio and you find yourself bumping the remote back up. Small potatoes. Actually, my main irk about this specific set is that you have to 'punch in' every single episode, as you watch, rather than there being a 'Play All' choice on the discs - usually no big deal, but I'm still getting over major back surgery and having to get up and down is a bummer. But I'm not kidding you when I say that that is my only complaint about Serling's Season 1 - just an amazing, amazing offering of writing, creativity and - in most cases - wonderful acting from all involved. This series absolutely does deserve its' lofty position in Television History, and I've read that some reviewers are bummed at the stinginess of extras offered - just some audio recollections by guest stars, a coujple of Rod's audio lectures, the original next-week promos and one (yep, ONE) blooper...but this review is about the series, in my opinion. And The Twilight Zone, Season One, is - you guessed it - fantastic!!!!!",1288656000,3,3005,4.650375939849624

When I posted my original review, I didn't notice something critically important you may wish to consider.

As I'm posting this update there are currently 145 customer reviews giving this product an average rating of 4.2 out of 5 stars.  Seems like my defective set was probably just a rare glitch, right?

Well, not exactly. Of those 145 reviews, how many have been posted after the product release date or a few days before?  This *BLU-RAY* set was released on 9/14/10.  Read over the reviews and check for yourself but my count since the release date is only 28 reviews!!!!!!  It seems that most of the reviews listed on this product page are for a ***different*** product, The Definitive Edition DVD's (which in my own experience was a good buy).

Of the reviews that are specific for this *BLU-RAY* set since it's release, by my count 15 of the 28 describe playback issues with a variety of different players cited.  Of course, many of the more recent reviews are the 1-star rating.

Right below the reviewers name, you will see a notation that ""This review is from the"".  Notice how many are ""The Twilight Zone - Season 1 (The Definitive Edition) (DVD)""!  There are even a few reviews for the DVD set mixed in with the more recent product reviews.

Amazon needs to fix this.  If they did, the overall rating for this product, as well as the high percentage of people thus far who have received defective *BLU-RAY* discs would be more accurately reflected.
-------------------------------------
I so sincerely regret posting this 1 star review.

I'm a longtime Twilight Zone fan and was thrilled beyond words to hear these were coming out on bluray.  I even sold my DVD collection on eBay shortly after the announcement!  That turned out to be a bonehead move on my part.

My Season 1 set also had to be returned due to playback issues.  Disc 4 wouldn't load at all.  Do a general search online, and there are multiple reports of functional problems with a variety of different players.  I was fortunate enough to get a credit instead of an exchange for Season 1, and am regretfully cancelling my preorder for Season 2.

I'll probably just wait for a box set.  Hopefully by the time several months go by, the quality control issues will be sorted out.  I'm holding off for the time being.",1288051200,27,2317,4.6923076923076925

I was unable to get the disc to load on my Samsung BD-P1500.  I was up to date on my firmware.  The disc at first would spin and spin and lock up the player.  I e-mailed Image to report the problem and received no response.  Another update was available from Samsung and I updated the player again.  The disc would spin and give me a written message that the disc was unplayable.  I again e-mailed Image and still no response.  Since Image is slow to acknowledge the problem and offer a solution, I returned the set for a full refund.  I really wanted to keep this set as the visual quality is stunning.

2179019,1,B00068NVMK,"My first review for a product on Amazon.
I would have given this set 5 stars, if it played. I had read of the problems on this set. Then Amazon stopped selling it, put it up for review. Then they started to sell it again, and on sale for under $58. Took the leap of faith, and bought it!

As soon as the set arrived, I went right to one of the episodes I read was ""problematic"", The Big Tall Wish on disc 4. Sure enough, the episode freezes at 12:30, and will not stat playing again. I skipped to the next episode and the disc would freeze, and skip.

Image needs to address this, and I hope Amazon stops selling it (for good) until this problem is resolved.

I am playing this on a Sony BDP1000ES, a great player, that has played everything, up to this point. I have the latest firmware too. Hope this gets fixed, cause I would love to own it, and give it 5 stars!",1287532800,13,865,4.076470588235294
2179020,1,B00068NVMK,"I received this Twilight Zone Season 1 with 5 Blu Ray discs. Disc #3 and #4 wouldn't play in my Blu Ray Panasonic BD30 player. Amazon sent me a another set and this time Disc #4 will not play. Only a year ago I installed Firmware update 2.8 to fix some problems with current Blu Ray movies so I wouldn't think I need to do another Firmware update this soon. Does anybody know if there is another Panasonic BD30 Firmware update after 2.8 that would fix this problem? The fact that some of the discs play and others don't suggests Image Entertainment ran off a batch of defective discs.

On 2 November 2010 I received a free replacement set from Image Entertainment after i had contacted them, so Image does get credit for trying to fix the problem. However, disc #4 still does not work and this was after I upgraded the firmware to the latest version 2.9 on my Panasonic BD30 player. I emailed Image and they said they would send me another disc #4 which has been checked for defects. That means that as of 4 days ago when the free replacement set was mailed to me, Image still had defective discs in inventory, even though Amazon has removed its advisory warning about this item and now lists it in stock. I called Amazon about this and they said Image said the problem had been fixed, but that Amazon would be pull the item again from In Stock status if more customers complained about defective discs. So if you have a recent defective disc be sure to post a negative review so as to keep up the pressure on Image to make sure this problem is fixed for Season One and the later seasons.

On 4 November 2010 I received a replacement disc #4 ( it didn't have the artwork, just printing in black letters and date from June 2010) that works ok, so I am grateful to Image Entertainment for helping me out. I told the customer service rep at Image that I would continue buying future TZ Blu Ray sets and that I would ask for replacement discs for any more problem disc.

I sent this first set of discs back hoping it was an isolated case.  Unfortunately, the replacement disc I ordered has the same exact defect.

I guess quality control is not a high priority at Amazon.  I am a Twilight Zone fan and was extremely disappointed. The quality of the discs that worked was excellent, it was like I was watching the epidsodes when they first aired.  I kind of wished that they had included some of the commercials from back in the day.  Due to the excellent quality of the discs I was able to watch is the only reason I gave it two stars.  Now I am a hesitant to purchase Season 2 when it is released.",1286496000,5,630,3.992
2179025,5,B00068NVMK,"After first learning about this Blu-ray release, I was hesitant as I already own the Definitive DVD set.  Regardless, my wife surprised me with this for our anniversary as she knows I'm a fan of both The Twilight Zone and the Blu-ray format.

So far I've watched all the episodes, but none of the extras so I can't comment on those specifically.  My first impression was that the picture quality looks very good, but I wasn't necessarily blown away when comparing to how I remember the DVDs looking.  I decided to do an A/B comparison, using my Panasonic BD60 for the Blu-ray and my Oppo 980H for the DVD (both going to a Pioneer 50"" Kuro plasma).  I compared random frames in pause mode with two episodes, ""One For The Angels"", and ""Perchance To Dream"".  The amount of detail in longer shots was more of a subtle difference, but the Blu-ray still looked better.  I noticed how the Blu-ray revealed much blacker blacks, and whiter whites.  Because of this, the DVD has a bit of a yellow tinge that you don't see on the Blu-ray.  It was obvious at this point that my memory of how the DVD looked was not the best.

Close-ups is where we see the the advantages of the Blu-ray to a much greater degree.  In ""One For The Angels"", I was amazed at the added detail in Mr Death's hair, you can see every strand, and the black level makes it look even more realistic.  In ""Perchance To Dream"", I paused both players when we see the close up of Richard Conte's face in horror.  I could see far more detail, I literally saw the pores on his chin.  The DVD didn't quite reproduce this frame as faithfully.

The sound quality of the Blu-ray, with it's lossless PCM audio track, is slightly better than the DVD's lossy Dolby Digital track (I'm using an Onkyo 705 receiver and JBL Northridge speakers).  What's cool is the fact that both unrestored and restored audio tracks are included on the Blu-ray, and it's interesting to compare the two.  At times, I couldn't tell the difference, and in other instances, the difference was very noticeable.  Mostly what I heard was loudness level fluctuations in the unrestored track, and much more uniform audio with the restored lossless audio track.  This made dialogue more consistent and intelligible.  The restored track also seems to have slightly clearer bass response.  I'll give the audio 4 out of 5 stars.

Overall, I give the picture quality of this Blu-ray 5 stars.  When I first saw the Definitive DVDs, I would have also given them 5 stars as they looked better than I'd ever seen this show look (and that was with an older Pioneer DVD player and S-video!).  On my Oppo upconverting player, the DVDs look even better.  However, the Blu-ray looks even better yet.",1286496000,19,2704,4.583333333333333
2179026,5,B00068NVMK,"Just a note to all. There has been ample mention of problems with the Blue_ray discs not working in some players. I have a Sony BDP-S350 player and the discs will not load. I also have a Sony PS3 in which the discs DO load & play perfectly.

So Image Entertainment has got a problem that they will have to correct for purchasers of this set. In the meantime, wait until this has been corrected before purchasing unless you can get info of hardware that this works on from folks who have no problems with it. If you've got a PS3, these disc should work for you.

As for the set itself, 5 stars. Unbelievable video quality. Looks like they could have been shot yesterday,even in B&W,never mind over 50 years ago! The bonus material alone is worth the price.

2179038,5,B00068NVMK,"It's an expensive proposition to replace DVDs with BDs, and not always worthwhile. My two favorite shows, Firefly and Deadwood, have DVDs with such exceptional mastering that it isn't really worth the added expense, even with a home theater. I wasn't sure about TZ, so I got this set to compare with the Image/CBS 45 volume set which, all things considered, isn't too bad (SD, yes, but remastered; not just tatty old TV prints). I was truly surprised by just how good the BD set is. The sound and video quality are not just better (to be expected), but entrancingly better. This isn't just an HD effect; I noticed the same thing when Criterion (as Janus) remastered its classic B&W films. They drew you in - you didn't want to stop watching. Perhaps there's a kind of video fatigue that comes from poor B&W prints, but pristine ones, as here, are engaging. I've decided to buy the entire BD set. And a bonus - they take up one quarter the shelf space.
  I was alarmed at the reports of loading problems, since my player, a Panasonic BD605, already failed to load two copies of Inglorious Bastards (misspell that as you wish) and I had to get the DVD instead. However, it loaded all of these perfectly.
  One unanticipated bonus, which should delight anyone as foolish as I was to purchase this player, is the formatting. The full-screen image is imbedded in a 16x9 black background, which overcomes one of the extraordinary design defects of the 605 - bright gray pillars on the sides (which, like the strobing bugs of the STRZ network, is a mortal enemy of the home theater experience by flooding the room with ambient light).
  Anyone who's going to spend the money to buy this set should really obtain Zicree's Twilight Zone Companion, if they already haven't.
  In short, worth the money. It actually feels like you're watching these for the first time.

  Absolutely NOBODY should be complaining about the price on this release!!!  I bought the ORIGINAL DVD releases (ALL 45 volumes) more or
less as they hit the shelves, my wallet co-operating.  Those were, ""Treasures of The Twilight Zone"", ""More Treasures of The Twilight Zone"", and
volumes 1-43.  Some of the numbered volumes even re-packaged what was already available in the 2 named sets.  These things cost about 20 bucks
each as I recall, so call it $900 for my entire TZ collection.  And I did NOT get the INCREDIBLY RARE, ""Westinghouse Desilu Playhouse"" episode,
""The Time Element"", which we hardcore ZONISTS have been SCREAMING BLOODY MURDER FOR FOR YEARS!!!!!  Also, the episodes were in NO discernible order
on the discs.  They would come up with a theme for a disc and find some episodes to fit that theme from any of the 5 seasons.  And with all the commentary,
that's another big bonus.  Now, all that said will I be getting this release?  No.  And why not?  Because they'll release all 5 seasons in a DELUXE set
later, at about a 20% savings.  If they would have just released the whole thing at once, I'd order it now.  But... they didn't.  So I'll wait.  And bide
my time.  And wish them into the cornfield if they drag their feet TOO long!!!!!  Have a nice day. :-)",1284681600,4,1291,4.599118942731278
2179046,5,B00068NVMK,"Hi Folks,

the set arrived today and I had to pop it in for a quick look see...
I chose ""Time Enough At Last"" for a first preview...and while the episode looked sharp as  a tack (of course the definitive version on normal DVD looked pretty darned good  as well) I was a bit taken aback by the lack of contrast...or a strong black. I did notice Burgess Merediths glasses looked nice and black so assuming that the setting was just mid tones ...jumped to another favorite episode ""A Passage for Trumpet"" and was stunned by how beautiful the new BLU Ray versions handle dark and shade and light..the more Noir styled Zones which often were my favorites! I also had to take a peek at the Desilu Playhouse ""The Time Element"" and could seemingly count the hairs on William Bendixs' head it was so sharp as was Martin Balsam.

I'm not going to review this series....which I among many others believe may be the greatest in the history of TV...I just wanted to tell those like me ""on the fence"" in regards to moving up yet again to another format (VHS, DVD, DVD definitive and now Blu Ray)of my findings.

2179047,3,B00068NVMK,"Hey I just got the Twilight Zone First Season Blu Ray 5 disks set. ONLY THE  FIFTH DISK WILL PLAY!

Someone said it may be a firmware issue but that's not true if only one disk out of five plays.  So it can't be a  ""Firmware"" issue.

Upon closer inspection, I noticed finger prints on the shiny side of disk 1,2,and disk 4 has a clear full finger print on disk four - HuMMMMMMMM?  I also noticed the shrink wrap was softer than the standard ""BRITTLE FEEL"" and did NOT carry the standard ""FOLDED"" top and bottom corners, so it seems that it was repack? I have over three hundred Blu rays and this is NOT the same shrink wrap packaging.

I will be back to share with Amazon customers the hair raising journey of getting a refund from Amazon and or Image Ent.

10/15/2010: OK I'm back - Yes this issue IS a firmware problem because when I updated my player everything plays and is fine. I was so sure that firmware was not the problem since I thought it affect all disk not just a few disks in the set. I was wrong and thanks for the advice! As to the customer service, the Sony telephone customer service was superb. fast to download and they sent a CD in the mail for free containing the same update.

2179049,5,B00068NVMK,"After reading the other reviews, I felt a need to add my own review.  I, too, have purchased every edition of the Twilight Zone as it was released, from tape to the Definitive Editions.  Yes, it would have been cheaper to wait on Blu-Ray, but who knew the abilities of Blu-Ray would even exist years ago.  I received my Season One Edition on Blu-Ray, and have no regrets in the purchase.  I have already pre-ordered Season Two!  I have watched several episodes and think the transfer job was outstanding; but the best part of all was being able to watch William Bendix in the unofficial pilot, ""Time Element"".  What a great show, especially uncut and without station logos in the picture.  Image-Entertainment has done a great job with this set; now if they would only issue the final season of Night Gallery, another Rod Serling creation.",1284508800,13,839,4.705479452054795
2179050,5,B00068NVMK,"I just got my copy of TZ Season 1 on Blu-Ray and although I have only watched two episodes, all I can say is ""wow"".

First off, I don't have the Definitive Collection so I don't know how clean the transfers looked and sounded. I had the original release on DVD where the episodes from different seasons were places on the same DVD and what a difference the Blu-Ray version makes. I can say that even up-converting the existing DVDs doesn't produce a picture this clean.

The video looks really good. There is still some frames that look dirty or have what looks like scratches on them, but it is at minimum and after growing up watching these on Channel 5 in LA, it would seem weird to not see artifacts on the picture. They also sound great - audio levels have been adjusted and leveled out. Rod's narration is clean and pops out of the center channel nicely.

My only criticism so far is that the extras need some work. Judging by the quality, they are just quick transfers from existing DVD releases so the video is sometimes stretched to format 16x9 and the audio levels are wayyyy down. They feel sort of slapped on.

Overall I love this and would suggest it to any TZ fan. Keep 'em coming.",1284422400,14,1195,4.393665158371041
2179051,5,B00068NVMK,"For years we all tuned in to hear these words, spoken in the raspy voice of the man responsible for bringing this series to our world: There is a fifth dimension beyond that which is known to man. It is a dimension as vast as space and as timeless as infinity. It is the middle ground between light and shadow, between science and superstition, and it lies between the pit of man's fears and the summit of his knowledge. This is the dimension of imagination. It is an area which we call ""The Twilight Zone"".

With those few words put together, a new catch phrase was introduced to the world: the Twilight Zone. When people talk about being zoned out or of someone seems to be lacking in attention, we still ask if they're in the twilight zone. And it all started with a TV series.

Writer Rod Serling was already a celebrated scriptwriter when the series began in 1959. But his name would forever be linked to the odd anthology series that found him on screen each week, introducing what would be the next eerie or mysterious tale being told. His voice is one that fans and non-fans alike connect to the show. And while he went on to do other things, TWILIGHT ZONE is what he will forever be remembered for.

So why discuss TWILIGHT ZONE now? Image has just released the definitive version of the show.  The entire first season of the series is now available on blu-ray disc. The images that were just a bit fuzzy when we viewed them so long ago are now visually pristine, shades of black and white so clear as to make them look as if it's the first time you're watching the show.  Not only that, they've included a number of goodies for fans of Serling and the series alike including interviews with Rod Serling that were done later.

Going back and watching these episodes I was amazed at the quality of storytelling that was going on. And I think that was the secret to the series. It wasn't based around cardboard characters that we witnessed in similar situations each week. It was an anthology series with different actors and most importantly different stories. And perhaps the telling thing about the show was that each week an entire story was told in less than 30 minutes. Even with a 60 minute show these days (minus time for commercials) writers for the most part can't get that done. Instead we're given plenty of car chases and fight scenes. TWILIGHT ZONE relied on none of these.

Everyone has a favorite episode and all of them from the first season are offered here. Two of my favorites are included. ""Time Enough At Last"" in which a bookworm played by Burgess Meredith finds himself the lone survivor after the world has been destroyed, now with enough time to himself to read everything he ever wanted to. But nothing is normal in the Twilight Zone. The second is ""The Monsters Are Due on Maple Street"" where we witness the slow dissolve of trust between friends and neighbors who suspect that one of them, or perhaps more, are actually aliens. Again, that twist at the end makes the story even more surprising.

It would be easy to sit back and wait for the shows to appear on TV once again. SyFy network seems to run marathons each three day holiday weekend. But with the release of this new blu-ray set you don't have to. You can sit back and watch them at your leisure, viewing your favorites.

Extras just on this edition include the unofficial pilot hosted by Desi Arnaz,  a ""Tales of Tomorrow"" episode, syndication promos, isolated musical scores, 18 radio dramas, interviews with stars of the episodes and audio commentaries. Other extras include the afore mentioned audio interviews with Rod Serling done at Sherwood Oaks College, the unaired pilot version of ""Where Is Everybody?"" with the pitch to the studio by Serling and footage of the Emmy Award wins for the show.

Fans will definitely want to add this set to their collection. For others it's a great way to jump on and become familiar with one of the best written shows ever to air on TV. And still for many it will be the first time they've ever seen the show, which is sad, because to date they've missed what will forever be one of the best. And this is perhaps the best way to see it, offered with one of the best collections of extras available on any DVD set.

If ""Twilight Zone"" is a part of your vocabulary, then you need to add this to your collection. If its not, you need to visit this land between sight and sound, between science and superstition, a dimension of imagination known as...the Twilight Zone.",1283904000,6,4504,4.540073982737361
2179052,1,B00068NVMK,"Don't you feel cheated? I know I do... In how many ways and how many more times will we be lured into buying a re-packaged, re-mastered and enhanced edition of TZ?, and I especially mean content-wise: why couldn't they put all the 'new extras' in the so-called ""Definitive"" version? What was so definitive about it then? And more importantly, should I fall for the ruse now and buy the seasons separately as each becomes available (why didn't they release them all at once?), or should I wait for the ""Entire Series Truly Definitive Deluxe Package"" which will be conveniently released in time for Christmas, probably in a wooden coffin and including some special bonus like a numbered litograph or a limited-edition Rod Serling doll which recites the intro every time you push its head downwards? (And if they use my ideas I should at least get some credit...)

Those of us who fell for the scam the last time should be offered a rebate when purchasing this ""New and Improved-Definitively Final Blu-Ray (with new extras!)"" version.

2179070,5,B00068NVMK,"An amazing series that television enthusiasts still regard as one of the medium's truely great classics, ""The Twilight Zone"" was created by legendary writer Rod Serling who also created ""Night Gallery"" for NBC in 1969. ""The Twilight Zone"" debut on CBS in October, 1959 to critical acclaim, but it took awhile before the series found its audience. Running for five seasons, year one is looked upon as being its best with Serling writing all but one of the scripts. The series is the best anthology series ever and tells stories in a thirty minute time frame that deals with somewhat distorted individuals in distorted situations. In this amazing box set all 36 episodes are included along with the pilot shot in 1958. What is amazing about the series in this day in time is how the show has held up so well; this is a testament to the kind of writing that show had.
 ""The Twilight Zone"" never had a continuous cast of regulars, but instead employed some of the biggest names in Hollywood from the late fifties to the early sixties. In season one people like Ida Lupino and Burgess Meredith made guest appearances.
 This set includes an array of bonuses including audio commentaries, guest-star interviews, and more. The shows themselves look impeccable being transferred from their original camera negatives and magnetic soundtracks.

Those interviews truly add to the appreciation and uniqueness of the series.  There are also the lead-in commercials to other top shows of the period, such as ""The Danny Thomas Show"".  That makes for a fine re-creation of what it was like to watch ""The Twilight Zone"" when it was first run. I wish there had been more interviews of other personnel working on the series.

The classic music was not a part of the episodes that we watched, and the (four?) episodes- out of many, it's really a lot of episodes- were all about alone-ness. After seeing these few, I wonder if Serling was in a reflective, perhaps depressed time of his life.

2179077,5,B00068NVMK,"Submitted for your approval: a classic series about fantastic tales, stretching beyond the imagination and goes beyond the years they were broadcast.  A series we simply know most formally as, 'The Twilight Zone.'  Though the series itself was first broadcast in 1959, I didn't officially become a TZ Visitor until about 30 years later.  Originally watching these programs in syndication, I enjoyed watching these tales, which in consideration, were far better than the offerings we were given along the lines of sci-fi, horror and suspense of the Seventies and Eighties.

Without this wondrous dimension, we'd never have the existence of other anthology series. But I digress, the Twilight Zone Definitive Edition is aptly well-named, as this offering brings back the best of the series' offering.

Season One offers many of the classic tales we've made into identifiable icons for the series:  The Monsters Are Due on Maple Street, Time Enough at Last, The After Hours and Walking Distance (some which have now been recently made into graphic novels).

The interesting items about these tales, they maintain a timeless appeal to us.  Besides being remastered from the negative, these episodes also contain 'And now, Mr. Serling,' in which Rod provides a trailer for the next show, as well as classic adverts for other programs and ads at the time.  My only discern is, it seems the episodes cannot be played continuously as with most collections.  However, at the writing of this review, I suspect the later volumes bring up this option.

Nonetheless, the Definitive Edition brings back the episodes the way they were meant to be viewed, uncut and unedited, with the stories intact.  Remarkably, with those just visiting, or long-time tourists, The Twilight Zone Definitive Collection is the best product for those who loved the program and desire classic tales of beyond.

The retail price keep lowering over the months but by now it's beyond affordable. I recommend you grab this season box set today.

I also suggest you buy ""The Twilight Zone: Unlocking the Door to a Television Classic"" because the 800 plus page book is a P-E-R-F-E-C-T companion to the DVD box set.

And like most of the episodes, this one has a social message about mankind's foibles and weaknesses.  My favorite scene comes at the end -- I can still hear Burl Ives' sinister laughing while saying, ""This is the other place.""  Watch it if you haven't already.",1221177600,,442,4.776315789473684

Commentaries from a who's who of the great actors that have graced the show, the fantastic music scores, the Rod Serling goodies,... they all make this set far and away the best DVD set to date, not only of the ""Zone"", but of almost any television show box set I've ever seen.

2179101,5,B00068NVMK,"When purchasing a DVD on any of the ""Twilight Zone"" episodes, I think it is safe to say that in the majority of cases the buyer knows those stories by heart. The main concern is one of quality. How does the picture measure up? In this case I have never seen better transfers. The images are excellent. They are sharp, clear and maintain consistent contrast.
Rod Serling was a man of great literary and social intellect, somewhat ignored because of the genre he worked within and was famous for. ""The Twilight Zone"" frequently bordered on the edges of science fiction if not immersed in it. Society's values being what they are, science fiction has never been thoroughly embraced by conventional thought as a legitimate literary or cinematic art form. That is society's loss and Serling's heartbreak. However, ""The Twilight Zone"" still endures.
I still enjoy hearing Bernard Herrmann's opening theme. It brings back many memories. I love ""Walking Distance"" with Serling's prose, Herrmann's score and Gig Young's endearing performance. It gives me a feeling I can't describe. My heart goes out to ""Walking Distance"" like no other episode. It's part of my life.",1196121600,,1158,5.005181347150259

With todays space shuttles technology all those rockets launches seem antiquated. We all ready sent people into space but the only one that seems relavent to today is Where Is Everybody?

Some episodes do retain some of the horror quality that I remember as a child Long Live Walter Jamison is still sends shivers up my spine; glad to see it again.

The only problem I have with some of these episodes is that they deal with social problems like bias; Judgement Night had a Nazi realism which was quite disturbing; and the Monsters are Due on Maple Street seems like they took a cue from todays papers.

When can we expect Image or another company to pick up the ball and get that season captioned?  I have no doubt that if this is done, many customers with hearing loss will surely want to get their hands on that set and watch the proceedings.  The explanation for my rating is that a 5 is given to the quality of the Twilight Zone programs and a 0 for the lack of captioning which provides an overall rating of 3.",1173398400,11,679,4.307086614173229

I loved it so much, I purchased Seasons 2 and 3. Could watch these over and over again and would never tire of them. CLASSICS all the way.",1168732800,4,275,4.3076923076923075

2179114,4,B00068NVMK,"Great, inspiring short stories, most of which make you think. The Definitive Collection is the best places to start for the Twilight Zone.

While the quality of the episodes is fantastic, the extras are rather lacking. About all you get is Rod's promos for the next episode and audio commentaries. There's no documentaries or TV featurettes about The Twilight Zone or Rod Serling (Maybe there is none? Hard to believe).

The ""Sherwood Oaks College"" audio lectures are interesting as they discuss filming techniques and plot positives/negatives for certain episodes.

However, I had to force myself to listen to the Marc Scott Zircree interviews with Rod Serling. The information was great, but the interviewer has this unemotional ""uh-huh"" that he does EVERY THREE SECONDS and it's extremely annoying.

Aside from that, an outstanding collection!",1167868800,2,846,5.338345864661654
2179115,5,B00068NVMK,"The price for these just raised as the complete set was made available for $250.00. Unfortunately I have purchased The Definitive Collection Seasons One and Two so unless I sell these and purchased the entire collection I am out of luck because I cannot with good common sense buy these individually for $90 when I purchased the first two for @$70 and saw the price drop recently to @$50.00. I was back to buy the rest of the seasons and saw this increase. Why?????

* I love The Twilight Zone and the seasons that I have so I won't rate the DVD's low - I am just not happy with the pricing inconsistencies.*",1167696000,2,608,4.380530973451328
2179126,5,B00068NVMK,"I was very confused by the title of this collection. I saw a collection in a store., also called the ""Definitive Edition"" which included a collector's book filled with trivia about the series and photographic stills. So, I expected this to be the same set, though it was a few dollars cheaper. I was stunned when it arrived in a different format with all the video but no book. As for the videos themselves, this is an excellent collection and very well mastered. My only complaint is that each episode requires multiple clicks to view because of the way the menus are built. Instead of just clicking an episode and having it play, you are taken to a screen where you select from the scenes in that episode. You can select the first one and it plays through to the end. This is mildly annoying, but not a big deal. When the episode finishes, you end up back on that scene selection screen instead of at the main menu, which is also less than ideal. But it's a minor complaint considering the otherwise superb quality of the set.",1167004800,3,1028,4.473404255319149
2179127,5,B00068NVMK,"Such things are available at [...] and elsewhere, but their place of origin is most assuredly... The Twilight Zone.

Ah, what can you say about The Twilight Zone? In my humble opinion, it's a work of art as much as it is a TV show, one of the best television shows *ever.*

You almost cannot say enough good things about this show. For its time, it combined top notch writing, cinematic production values, techniques, and storytelling, and excellent acting. It has bequeathed a legion of pop culture references to the current generation, its plot twists are legendary, it made its influence felt in so much of what was to come that it would be difficult to catalogue it all. Some of the filming techniques such as camera angles and lighting were ahead of their time for television (watch ""Third from the Sun"" for a good example of this). So much of the movies, books, and TV shows that people have found entertaining since the Twilight Zone had their genesis in this show. If you got a group of people together to list all the movies that seem to have borrowed from the Twilight Zone, you end up with quite a staggering list, some of which you may have never thought of yourself! I had that reaction when someone suggested The Twilight Zone episode ""Night of the Meek"" had a lot in common with ""Bad Santa"" and ""Perchance to Dream"" had much in common with ""A Nightmare on Elm Street.""

The Definitive Edition DVD seasons bring you The Twilight Zone as you've never seen it before, excellently restored and uncut (not like the butchered syndicated episodes). And extras! You've got more *quality* extras than you can shake a stick at! So many DVDs cheap out on extras, the Definitive Edition set(s) give The Twilight Zone the royal treatment it deserves in extra features. They're all worthwhile.

Here are my favorite extras:

- All the extras associated with the first episode (and there are a ton of them on the disc with the episode and the bonus disc), including the original intros and endings (with a different narrator), Rod Serling's pitch to the networks, and his college lecture, in which he tells a humorous story about how he got the idea for the phone booth scene in ""Where Is Everybody?""

- Rod Serling's college lecture on ""Walking Distance.""

- Rod Serling's college lecture on ""And When the Sky Was Opened"" (it's informative and hilarious).

- Rod Taylor doing a commentary on ""And When the Sky Was Opened"" some 40 odd years after it aired!

- Martin Milner's commentary on ""Mirror Image.""

Actually, I have to say all the extra features are well worth your time, but generally my favorites are the Marc Zircee interviews and very insightful and some great extras are Rod Serling's college lectures. Kudos to whoever dug those up, they're fascinating and entertaining listens! You learn all sorts of things... how Serling often did not regard some things in the shows as very good, how he hated the establishing lines in ""And When the Sky Was Opened"" (this part in the lecture was *hilarious* to me), and you get to learn a very sad story from the making of the episode ""The Mighty Casey."" Zircee's interviews with various different people, including Richard Matheson, are a treasure as well, thought I don't always agree with some of his criticisms. We can only wonder what if Zircee had been able to interview Serling, but he had passed on by that time sadly.

Even the commercial bumpers are a treat, a view of a bygone era. The Liar's Club episode was even rather amusing. If you're a Twilight Zone fan, you really can't go wrong indulging in each and every extra. I know on some DVDs I pass on some of the more stodgy looking extras, in my opinion, they're all fun (though the commercial sponsor bumpers less so).

Well, enough about the extras, how about the episodes? Fantastic, as I've said. Some of the best work you'll ever see, I think. Season 1 has a lot of the best Twilight Zone episodes ever, the cream of the crop. There are ten or so episodes that are only so-so for the Twilight Zone, which means they're above average television shows, but not top-notch. My favorites from this season include:

Where Is Everybody?

The Lonely (Great, touching story. Really gives you a great of the spectrum the show would go on to cover.)

Time Enough at Last (Can anything more be written? Classic!)

Perchance to Dream (Very eerie and surreal)

And When the Sky Was Opened (An absolute first-rate classic in every way.)

Third From the Sun (Great story and acting, stunning visuals, top notch episode.)

I Shot an Arrow Into the Air (Excellent. The classic ""strand astronauts on an unknown planet and get ready for an ironic twist to blow you away"" episode. In retrospect the movie ""The Planet of the Apes"" is like one long Twilight Zone episode.)

The Hitch-Hiker (Going my way? One of the creepiest episodes and a fan favorite, featuring Inger Stevens.)

Mirror Image

The Monsters Are Due on Maple Street (One of the very best Twilight Zone episodes ever, if I made a top 5 list this would make it. A chilling glance at the what lies beneath the idyllic veneer of post-World War II American suburbia, and an indictment of Cold War paranoia. Amazing episode.)

A World of Difference (Fascinating premise, and very well executed. The acting and the script really make the main character sympathetic and the story involving.)

People Are Alike All Over (Roddy McDowell is the victim of more interplanetary irony.)

A Nice Place to Visit (A friend of mine once said that the best Twilight Zone endings are those that end with someone laughing and/or screaming. This episode has a nice kick to the gut with some great mocking laughing right before the end narration. Good story.)

A Stop at Willoughby (As pertinent today as it was back then. Many people feel overstressed by the pressures and demands of modern lives. Watch this episode and see people felt similarly back then... and how one man longed for something better. An all-time fan favorite, deservedly so.)

The After Hours (Another creepy episode about a woman who finds something amiss on the 9th floor of a department store.)

A World of His Own (The best Twilight Zone twist ending ever? For comedic value, it's definitely a contender.)

In conclusion, I recommend this to anyone who is a fan of good television and good stories. The Twilight Zone may tout itself as science fiction but it is also a way to explore the issues that are pertinent to all humans and the human condition at large.",1156982400,16,6477,4.702033598585323

2179131,1,B00068NVMK,"Let's stop this Rod-Serling-Is-God hokum right now. I remember sitting in a revival theater a few years ago watching the original ""Planet Of The Apes."" As the apes were exchanging dull, pompous speeches, all I could think was: ""This sounds like a bad episode of the Twilight Zone."" Sure enough, as the credits rolled, the screenwriter was revealed to be Rod Serling. I want to know how this hack ever came to be regarded as the greatest writer of television's Golden Age. I can barely sit through one of his introductions with all that purple language and pseudo-lawyer phraseology. (Someone at CBS should have burned his thesaurus.) All that puffed-up language and pedantic delivery was only to conceal the triteness of his GREAT INSIGHTS into the human condition. Give me Alfred Hitchcock instead, who knew TV is hack work and had fun with ""Alfred Hitchock Presents."" Serling, on the other hand, was forever saving humanity from itself on the MGM lot. Most of Serling's scripts could have been produced by any half-bright freshman in a creative writing class. Okay, once in a while he hit paydirt, like the gambling yarn ""The Fever""; but even Serling admitted that two-thirds of his material was junk. The best thing about the first few seasons of TZ was the show clocked at a merciful half hour, which saved the actors from making long-winded speeches as in the fourth season when it stretched to a full hour. Serling's mediocrity was saved by greater talents than his own, namely the scoring of Bernard Hermann, some good scripts by Jerry Sohl, Charles Beaumont and George Clayton Johnson, the inspired acting of up-and-comers, and some interesting film-noirish direction. Even worse would be Serling's follow-up series in the late '60s, Night Gallery, which proved that the great auteur had lost none of his pomposity and bad writing with the passage of time.",1142812800,10,1864,4.958466453674121

2179137,4,B00068NVMK,"The Twilight Zone series (original) were in my opinion morality tales involving our own weaknesses and strengths facing those ""unknowns"" both from within ourselves and from outside influences. I much preferred the original to the newer version for this reason. The stories were solid and well told, later it went to a one hour series which I think took from the series.

The only complaint I have about this collection is in the special features. The interviews could have been much more rewarding if Marc Zicree (the interviewer) could have remained silent. After listening to the third interview and Mr Zicree's constant Hmmm, mmhs I lost interest. The nostaligic advertising appears comical today but the series is great to watch.

The first 3 seasons are the best and I'm partial to the second season...it seems to me that full length movies have been made from these 30 minute stories and many people today will recognize some big stars that started their careers in shows like the Twilight Zone.",1135468800,8,1001,4.9523809523809526
2179138,4,B00068NVMK,"First, let me comment on the quality of episodes. I am a diehard audiophile and videophile.
I viewed EVERY episode in a dedicated sound treated room on a 10ft Stewart screen with Krell audio processing at EVERY stage, faroudja video processing and the flagship dreamvision DLP projector. 6 high end state of the art speakers delivered the audio to my ears.

Each and every detail including defects are amplified and visible. Despite this the audio quality was FAR superior to any episode one can see on TV . The audio quality is naturally stereo only, however, the episodes were not aired any other way except perhaps in mono.
The video quality had some transfer defects with obvious pixelization and occasional blurring during rapid movement. However, the effect is only midly annoying even on a 10ft screen.

Overall, given the origin of the episodes the video and audio quality is good and enjoyable.

Now, I would NOT buy this particular version. My suggestion is to purchase the gold edition which contains every episode ever aired with bonus features. I repeat it contains EVERY episode EVERY season. It is far more economical priced around 200USD. Any number of online retailers carry the gold edition.",1128729600,21,1209,4.975247524752476
2179139,5,B00068NVMK,"When season 1 came out, I had already owned 3 of the 5 ""collection"" boxed sets, so I had a decision to make.  Do I just get the last 2 collections that I was missing and be done with it, or start collecting the show by series and resell my old ones?  Well, by personal preference, I would rather have the show on dvd season by season then at random, and I also wanted the companion book that came with this set.  The packaging, while very similar to the collection series, IMO is more attractive and built to last longer than the thin cardboard used for the collection set slip cases.  And as it turned out, when I sold my other collections on ebay, I got back at least 75 percent of the money I originally spent on them, so I didn't lose much.  I guess the bottom line is, if you already have all of the episodes on dvd and are happy with them, then it's probably not worth your time and money to resell your dvd's and by the new ones, because it's just maybe a few extras you don't have and a bit better picture.  But if you don't have the complete series yet, then definitely buy this!

The only thing that's a bit irritating with this set is that there is no ""play all"" selection, and when you select the episode, I didn't see an option to just play the episode.  Instead, it takes you to a chapter selection list, and all you can do is select the first chapter and start watching.  But, it's not enough to ruin the set for me.

As far pricing, I agree, this set is way overpriced.  I can always buy 5 disc sets of other t.v. shows for about $30 on sale at Best Buy when they are released, which makes it hurt to spend so much for TZ.  But, if people were willing to shell out the $75 per set on past sets, why should we expect a lower price on the new ones?  It's all a matter of what people are willing to pay.  These marketing people know what they're doing, and when they see people willing to spend the money, they'll charge as much as they can.  Period.  You have two choices - spend the money, or don't own the episodes because it's wishful thinking to think that you'll ever get these sets brand new for $30.",1125360000,10,2120,4.121654501216545

Most of the episodes have only ""isolated music"" as their sole ""special feature"".  Furthermore, most of the commentaries are just awful - usually its just the actor saying ""my look how young I am"" or talking about all the other work they've done and Not Commenting On The Program!  It is Very Disappointing especially since there isn't much commentary on the DVDs to begin with.  I do agree that the Serling lectures are very interesting as are a couple of the interviews that are used as commentaries.  But come on CBS, you can't do any better in rounding up someone from every episode to comment on it?  And then, you can't have them watch the episode more than once, or at least give them a list of questions, so the commentary is at least Mildly interesting?

2179158,3,B00068NVMK,"""The Twilight Zone"" has seen a number of releases within the past score of years; the oldest one being by CBS Video Library which was sold by Columbia House from the early 1990s, later re-vamped onto DVD. Image Entertainment picked up the torch in 1999 when they released the entire series on DVD, but like Columbia House before them, Image did not disc the episodes in chronological order of airdate. Gold Entertainment released the series appropriately in 2000, correcting this long-standing inconvenience. There was also the release of ""Treasures from The Twilight Zone"" by CBS in 1992, which included five episodes from the series plus Rod Serling's initial network pitch which sold the series, and an interview with Mike Wallace done in 1959, prior to the show's original airing.

2005 sees the re-release of the entire ""Twilight Zone"" canon by Image Entertainment; ""Twilight Zone"" is reportedly Image Entertainment's number-one selling DVD item, over and above every other product they sell.

The earlier discs, which can still be ordered online from any number of outlets, have supplemental material written by Marc Scott Zicree, aka 'The Twilight Zone guru', who has spent the better part of thirty years on ""Twilight Zone""-related projects. Trivia quizzes, episode and season synopses, actor profiles, and other tidbits written by Zicree are included on the previous discs for more-than-casual fans, aided by clever and easy-to-navigate menus. The navigation of the present series of discs is not quite as effective; the same montages used on the Columbia House versions were utilized, and the viewer does not have the option to 'play all' the episodes on the disc at once (each episode has its own menu with chapters, and there is a sub-menu inconspicuously nestled in for each episode's special features, including commentary tracks.)

The picture quality of both Image's and Gold's earlier discs was good overall, but a number of digital bloopers occur in nearly every episode. Image has supposedly re-mastered the footage from the original prints for the most recent release but this is more or less imperceptible for most of the episodes.

Aside from a few nice added bonus features, ""Twilight Zone: The Definitive Edition"" looks to be yet another example of how Hollywood production companies jam-pack the product with goodies instead of focusing on quality and distinguishedness of the content and its presentation. The six-disc Volume 1 set comes with an unceremoniously tacked-on version of Zicree's somewhat controversial ""Companion"" guide to the series. Published in 1982, this is a book that every fan of the series likely already owns, and which over the years has garnered a reputation for slapdash treatment and commentary of the episodes. Zicree's magnetic-tape interviews with directors Douglas Heyes, Richard L. Bare, writer Richard Matheson, producer Buck Houghton and several others, are tacked on in the menu's Bonus Features section. If you can overlook the interviewer's approbing utterances of ""mhmm"" after nearly every sentence spoken by the interviewees, these are enjoyable.

The notoriously ineffectual Radio Dramas (produced by Falcon Picture Group) - radio adaptations of many episodes, are included, presumably the result of a business deal aimed to promote a failing product. One has the option of listening to Kim Fields (""Tootie"" on the TV series The Facts of Life) drive the ultra-classic episode ""The After Hours"" into the ground after (or before!) watching Anne Francis spin Rod Serling's words into gold. Isolated scores for several episodes are included, but the only way the viewer can listen to them is against the backdrop of a silent version of the episode - that's right, you can listen to the music as you watch the characters mouthing all the dialogue. Surely the scores could have been released on the disc as MP3 files that could be played on most DVD players. Audio commentaries by stars Rod Taylor, Earl Holliman, Martin Milner, Martin Landau, and Kevin McCarthy and also former CBS President William Self are included. Inasmuch as it would've been nice to see these guys on camera again after so many years, their comments about the old days are splendid, despite a general lack of remembrance about working on the series (Milner spends a good three or four minutes discussing his current activities as host of a radio show on deep-sea fishing.)

A sixth bonus DVD offers segments of the game show ""The Liars Club,"" (a real hoot, featuring Betty White and Dick Gautier on the panel of liars!); a gallery of photos with about ten commonly-seen production shots, a sales pitch of Serling's to a Netherlands network, and a blooper of Serling while filming the intro to the fourth season episode ""He's Alive."" A complete ""Twilight Zone"" comic book is also included, in PDF (Adobe Acrobat Reader) format, which can be viewed on computer.

Thankfully, Image included the Rod Serling bumpers for next week's episodes, something which fans of the series have sought after for many years, and also the middle and ending billboards of Kimberly Clark and Sanka, ""Twilight Zone""'s sponsors of the first season. Clips of Serling claiming his two Emmys are welcome inclusions, as are two lectures Rod did around 1970 at Sherwood Oaks Experimental College, a seminar-based college in the Los Angeles area which featured lectures by such industry giants as Serling. The audio tracks for these were superimposed over the video tracks of ""Where Is Everybody,"" ""Walking Distance,"" and ""And When the Sky Was Opened"" (we assume these three episodes were the subject of Serling's lectures.) The track for ""Walking Distance,"" considered to be among the top five episodes of the series, is quite surprising as Serling denounces the storyline as flawed and illogical.

The same format and general content look to be the same for Seasons 2 through 5.

Fans of ""The Twilight Zone"" would probably do well to save $250-300 pick up a used copy of Gold Entertainment's complete version - minus the aforementioned bells and whistles.

2179159,5,B00068NVMK,"It's really great to watch these babies 45 YEARS LATER---yes, exactly 45 years to the day after they first premiered.  That's just the way the calendar has lined up since February. Now I take my time and watch one episode per week--on the exact date (and day of the week) that I FIRST saw them when they premiered in 1960.  What an amazingly potent ""sign of the times"" was TZ, and what a profound effect it had on a very impressionable boy of 9-10 years (me) back then.

It's fabulous to once again hear the announcer's ""And now, Mr. Serling....""

and to see next week's promo--now THERE""S something few of us have seen in 45 years!  Too bad that a number of them survive on the soundtrack only, with no visual. I clearly remember Rod Serling holding the Civil War photo album with Kevin McCarthy's picture in it the week before ""Long Live Walter Jameson"" first aired;  but alas, all we get is the soundtrack and no image.  Oh well....I'll never forget it, nor will I forget the impression that ""Long Live"" made on us when we first saw it.

Also really cool are the little ""bumpers"" at the half-way commercial break--the graphic of the landscape with the little rocks accompanied by Bernard Hermann's wailing french horn chords.  These fabulous 4-second shots were somehow a BIG part of each week's adventure back in 1960--when you didn't know if you were going to ultimately be amused, terrified, or saddened by the time the show ended. I am glad that the new edition FINALLY has seen fit to include them.

And speaking of all of the previous home-video TZ releases:  even though the opening graphic montage is well done (beginning with Murray Matheson's CLOWN face and William Windom's ""Who Are We?"" from ""5 Characters""), the various clips and sound bytes which they chose REVEAL MANY of the ""Twist"" endings right off the bat!  (""It's a Cook Book!""  ""I'm a Mannequin""....etc);  talk about SPOILERS!

If your a kid or somebody that never saw this show and don't like the black and white footage don't worry. The black and white just adds to the greatness of it all.

If you really love the Twilight Zone or want to find out how you like it this is something you shouldnt pass up.",1105228800,4,656,3.9097744360902253
2179173,4,B00068NVMK,"yes i'm am glad it was finally released with all the goodies, however there is a flaw in this series. where are thwy in the opening titles, 1st i will point out, that the first season had two opening titles orginally , ""the middle ground"" opening, and the last five episodes opened with a womans eye turning into the sun, but when the show went into syndication a lot of the episodes were replaced with season two opening titles, and were not corrected when the other dvd releases came out/ Although all the episodes now have the first season openings back, the first screw up is on the episodes that have there original openings back , you can see the stars from season two blended in,and it's supposed to be from the original negetives?also on two episodes

""mr denton on doomsday"" has the womans eye opening, when it's supposed have a middle ground opening, and ""a passage for trumpet"" has a middle ground opening , when it's supposed to have a woman's eye opening. Bottom line is if they couln't find the original episodes, they could have done a better job of editing , to make it look original, however i will give them credit for trying, and it still is a great set to have",1105142400,3,1180,4.462962962962963
2179174,5,B00068NVMK,"I read some of the questions about closed captioning, and thought I would add my two cents.  I tried to turn on captions while watching an episode last night and it seems there is no text on the dvd.  There were no options for closed captioning or  any alternate languages.  It does, however have very interesting bonus features; such as episodes with dialogue removed- showing the impressive score only, commentaries by actors- over 40 years later, current radio-drama remakes of original episodes, among other things such as a Rod Serling lecture & blooper reel.  I absolutely love this box set and find it well worth the money.  I refrained from buying the original boxed sets because I did not like the format, I am glad I waited, this set truly is the Definitive Edition.  The episode guide is helpful, insightful, and reminds me of several wonderful episodes to look forward to on future sets.  I have been having a wonderful time revisiting the old episodes I used to love watching with my Dad as a kid.  Even now, I am amazed at how far ahead of its time TZ really was.  The episodes are cleaned up and great quality.  If you need the captioning in order to buy the dvd set, I'm sorry- it does not seem to have it available.  I would hate to talk anyone out of buying this set, though.  I have been enjoying it very much and greatly anticipate the release of following seasons.",1104883200,8,1385,4.536290322580645
2179185,4,B00068NVMK,"Having viewed the six DVD's in this set, I have to say that CBS/Image finally got it right. The image transfers are as good as you can get (being from the original film negatives) the same can be said for the audio. I was glad they left in the ""bumpers"" and CBS show promos at the tail ends of each episode. My only reasons for giving this collection 4 stars instead of 5 is because some of the ""next week show promos"" are audio only, which (to me) means either the video quality was really poor, or there was some sort of sponsor tag on them burned in (I believe the former would be the more likely scenario). The other is, on the Extras DVD, they have the original billboards for the show. I would've preferred that they inserted these where they were originally before the first commercial, instead of giving us a comp reel of them. I'm definitely looking forward to season two when it's released in March, 2005.",1104883200,8,915,4.3882352941176475
2179186,5,B00068NVMK,"The original ""Twilight Zone"" series is still entertaining after all these years, and has inspired so many other writers and screenplays (for example, Stephen King's ""The Langoliers"" was obviously inspired by ""The Odyssey of Flight 33"").

If you're a younger person, don't let the black & white discourage you.  Watching these episodes will give you an idea why black & white is an entirely different (and in some ways superior) film medium compared to color.  Try it, you'll like it.

All this said, there's probably nobody who hasn't seen some ""Twilight Zone"" episodes, as the Sci-Fi channel has a marathon of them every new years eve.  Still, having them on DVD to watch anytime is a great thing.",1104796800,2,698,4.88135593220339

Unlike other black and white films of the time that have been colorized, these episodes are in black and white (thank goodness!) which makes the stories more dramatic and bold. In this first season, some of the most well-known episodes are included such as the Maple Street neighbors, the mannequin, and Burgess Meredith as a man who loved to read, but never had the time.  Includes commentary from those who worked on Twilight Zone, this is a true collector's item for those who would like to have the Twilight Zone marathon run on and on.",1104796800,3,624,4.715596330275229

2179189,5,B00068NVMK,"I have been waiting a long time for this. The original Twilight Zone, finally released in season sets. I just finished watching the first disk. The audio is as clear as a bell. The video, for as old as this series is, is excellent. I really enjoy the Serling lead-ins for next week's show. The episode voice-overs, by the various actors is entertaining as well as enlightening. The little advertisements at the end of the episodes for the other shows on CBS at the time, is a little distracting, but not too much...They included the ""Twilight Zone Companion""  book, by Marc Scott Zicree, with this set. Great reading, if you don't have it already. I'm looking forward to the future releases. Hopefully, they will include more extras. Maybe the long awaited release of ""The Time Element"", if they can find a print of it somewhere. This is a welcome addition to the DVD library of any serious fan of Mr. Serling's work.",1104710400,3,917,4.660493827160494

Amazon states it has closed-captions, but the box itself says nothing about captions or subtitles, and there are no captioning symbols on the packaging. If you have bought this set, would you be kind enough to confirm whether or not there are captions of any kind?

If there aren't any, shame on Image/CBS Video! Deaf and hard-of-hearing consumers like myself get cheated out of the opportunity to enjoy the same movies/TV programs their families, friends, and neighbors do.",1104710400,3,542,4.956043956043956
2179191,5,B00068NVMK,"I want to start this review with something that many are complaining about, the cost of the set.  The gripes all seem to be from people who have bought previous versions, and contain a little bit of sour grapes.  Of course, I speak from not having purchased any of the previous compilations (but almost did), so I am happy with the price, since it is 36 episodes after all.

It's true I am glad I found out about this new version before spending money on the others, but I have to say that this is the set everyone should have.  The extras make it so much more than whatever came before.  I like the isolated scores, but the best thing are the commentaries.  Landau's for ""Mr. Denton on Doomsday"" is very interesting and intelligent.  The most surprising one for me, though, was the audio Q&A that Serling had at a college in discussing my favorite episode, ""Walking Distance"".  It was a shock to discover how much Serling disliked his own writing of the episode many years later. I still think the writing shows a great tenderness and sensitivity, but he really turned against it.

Going back to the cost of the set, for a moment, part of the reason for the high price is that they include the book, ""The Twilight Zone Companion"", in the box. I already have an edition but it still a good idea to include it because of how much more people can get from the episodes by reading about the making of each while watching it.  (One bad part, though: this being a second edition of the book, I don't understand how they could not have fixed up the listing order of the episodes discussed into the way they were aired.  It would make it a lot easier to follow along.)

All in all, I am very glad to own this set, and I look forward to future ones, which will be cheaper because they won't have the book.",1104537600,12,1797,4.347305389221557
2179192,5,B00068NVMK,"Rod Serling was a writer's writer. His anthology series changed the way that science fiction, fantasy and horror were presented on TV. Although the episodes from the superb first season have been available on various anthologies released by Image Entertainment (and another company), this is the ultimate edition of the series on DVD. The image quality is exceptionally good with solid blacks and a crispness missing on some of the earlier sets.

The extras actually are what make this worthwhile to pick up. There are new audio commentaries by many of the stars that appeared in the original episodes and also excerpts from the interviews that Marc Scott Zicree conducted for his exhaustive tome THE TWILIGHT ZONE COMPANION. Additionally, there's an audio lecture that Serling gave. Add in the original promos for forthcoming episodes with Serling, the network pitch, the original cut for the pilot, isolated music scores by such masters as Jerry Goldsmith and Bernard Herrmann and you've got an outstanding package. Serling's bloopers show up on this set as well.

The addition of Zicree's superb ""The Twilight Zone Companion"" in a smaller format is the perfect book end for these classic episodes of television. Yes, you'll have to buy it again if you want all this stuff. Is it worth it? Absolutely for hardcore Zone fans this is like finding the Holy Grail. A hats off to Image for doing a terrific job with the first, best season of one of the most original anthology series ever broadcast.",1104537600,8,1496,4.98
2179193,3,B00068NVMK,"Having bought two of the ""other"" box sets, I'm disappointed Image didn't do it correctly the first time--all this material existed then but they chose not to include it. While I am very happy with the sets I have, this latest marketing [...] is nothing more than an attempt to milk a few more dollars from the loyal fans.
I remember when the X-Men DVD came out and Bryan Singer said this would be the only edition of the first movie. Yet around the time of X-Men 2 feature release, X-Men 1.5 was released. So much for integrity.
To those who say we didn't have to buy them, I agree. No one twisted my arm to buy these sets. So your answer is ""tough luck because a better one ""may"" come along some day""? And to those thinking of selling on eBay, I imagine the market value for your original box sets is dropping as you read this.
Will I continue to buy the original box sets? At this time, I doubt it. Will I buy the new sets? Maybe if I can sell my old sets. But at $80 a pop new, I don't think I'll get even half that so it looks bad. Especially if they are planning a super duper ""really this time"" definitive release five years from now.

I am greatly disapointed that Image did not include a Play All feature, as there are 7-8 episodes per disc, and it would have been nice to have your own little marathon. It seems you can only select one episode at a time and when it's over it comes back to the episode menu then you have to select Main Menu and then select another episode.

Someone posted that the set is not complete because it did not have what was supposed to be the original premire episode.  Well the fact of the matter is that it was never part of The Twilight Zone, hence not part of the set.

Someone also stated that due to the fact that the series is Forty years old there was not going to be new fans of the show.  That simply is not true.  I for one was not a fan untill last year.  There are rides on both coasts that can and will generate new fans of the shows.

I can't wait to get the other seaons to complete my set.  I highly recomend this set.",1104451200,,719,3.896551724137931
2179197,5,B00068NVMK,"It is absurd that this title has an average rating of below 5 stars. The low average rating is based on reviewers who are upset that they purchased older Twilight Zone collections that are now inferior to this superb collection. They feel they were ripped off by CBS video as if CBS planned on doing this all along. I doubt this was part of some plot. When first issued on DVD, the shows were randomly put together on single discs. Then these single discs were randomly put together in box sets. CBS finally wised up and realized that fans want it all. They want entire seasons on DVDs with extras. So now CBS Video has done it right.

While I understand the frustration of seeing the older collections become obsolete, that should NOT be a basis for reviewing this new collection. A review should be based on the product to be reviewed. Not on the company who issued it and not be prejudiced by frustrations of feeling the need to rebuy something. My review is based on what I received from CBS Video by way of Amazon.

This collection is how DVD collections should be done. It is comprehensive in that it contains all of the Twilight Zone episodes from the first season in the order they originally aired. It comes in slim cases, so it doesn't take up too much space. The attractive packaging for each slip case has information on the episodes contained on the disc in the case. The shows have been remastered from high quality original sources. They look superb. There are also some interesting extras, including commentaries, Rod Serling lectures, bloopers and Serling's network pitch for the pilot show. As for the 36 episodes from season one, nearly all excellent, with some being outright classics.

My personal favorite is ""The Monsters Are Due on Maple Street,"" which combines prejudice, morality and science fiction without preaching. Other classics include ""Walking Distance,"" ""Time Enough At Last,"" ""People Are Alike All Over"" and ""A Stop At Willoughby."" Great acting makes ""One For The Angels"" and ""A Passage For Trumpet"" must viewing. Creepy camera angles make ""Third From The Sun"" an interesting viewing experience. ""And When The Sky Was Opened,"" ""The Hitch-Hiker"" and ""The After Hours"" are both terrifying and unforgetable. The final show, ""A World of His Own"" is clever and humorous.

And as a special bonus, the set includes a reduced size edition of the excellect book ""The Twilight Zone Companion.""

""The Time Element"" was aired in November of 1958.  It was scripted by Rod Serling and intended to be the pilot episode for TTZ, but CBS instead showed it on Westinghouse Desilu Playhouse.  It starred William Bendix and Marin Balsam.  It's about a man who has a recurring dream that he's at Pearl Harbor on December SIXTH, 1941.  The show received such favorable viewer response that CBS ordered up a TZ pilot.  RS wanted ""The Time Element"" but now couldn't use it, so he delivered to them ""Where Is Everbody.""

I purchased the sets currently available, and don't regret it at all.

So what's the gripe? Pricing! Aside from the fact the show has been released on DVD at least twice before, once as individual disks of four episodes each and once as a box set of five but not in chronological order. They were way overpriced then and they are way overpriced now. Take a look around at the other tv season box sets. Heck just look at the Outer Limits (the original series).
