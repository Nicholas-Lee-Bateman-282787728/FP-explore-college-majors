8549935,5,B00AC9HF3Y,Out of all the episodes Chapter 2 was the most raunchy. Was not too crazy about that but what happens is what moves the story forward and puts the characters on a collision course that ultimately leads to the solidarity of the Adam's women. Overall I loved season one.,1474156800,,268,4.489795918367347
