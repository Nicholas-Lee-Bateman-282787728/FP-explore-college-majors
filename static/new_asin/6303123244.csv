570924,5,6303123244,"One of my goals it to help families not by films that they already have. If someone had the DVD A Very Merry Poor Year, it contains this story of Pooh and Friends trying to get their wish list to Santa Claus before Christmas. Pooh and Piglet find the letter did not make it too Santa, so they try to give everyone their wished for gift. Of course everyone does not understand why Santa would give them gifts that are not really what they wished for. Pooh is reveled as Santa and explains how sorry he did not send the letter the right way. Christopher Robin comes bearing Santa's gifts and everyone learns the care about each other more than they care about presents and that Christmas is really about love and friendship.",1131667200,,722,4.43609022556391
570925,5,6303123244,"This is one of the better Christmas specials for young kids and was a favorite of my teenager when he was little.  Pooh, Christopher Robin and the rest of the gang all write a letter to Santa Claus to tell him what they want for Christmas.  After mailing the letter, Pooh realizes he forgot to ask for a gift.  The gang then try and get the letter back and send it north but it just blows back. They soon realize it's Christmas Eve and it's too late.  Pooh then tries to disguise himself as Santa to give the gang a nice Christmas and eventually everything works out in the long run.

A very good special with heart and laughs.  The animation is very good unlike the regular Pooh TV show of the 190's and the late Paul Winchell does the voice of Tigger.  Delightful and kids will love it.",1127865600,,788,4.248322147651007

570927,5,6303123244,Paul Winchell did a very good job at doing the voice of Tigger. This is a sweet and touching Pooh video. I am proud to have it in my collection. I just wish that it was longer than 40 minutes. This is a must watch video at Christmas time.,1060387200,2,238,3.877551020408163
570928,5,6303123244,"Winnie The Pooh,everyone's favorite bear,has a Christmas special too! In the video,Pooh was busy at thinking up things that he wanted,but everyone else had,like Eeyore wanted an umbrella,Tigger wanted a bounce spring,and Rabbit wanted a bug swatter. And Christopher Robin wanted a sled. Pooh had to take a letter to the North Pole asking for honey. But unfortanetly,he failed,but everyone got their presents.",976752000,7,408,5.492063492063492

7838932,5,6303123244,I bought this movie to be able to watch the movies I grew up with and it was perfect. I love the movie and I am so happy I got it.,1393977600,,130,3.225806451612903
7838933,5,6303123244,I have enjoyed watching this special since I was a kid every holiday season and Hope that first it will be put on DVD and second that others will enjoy it as well.,1386979200,,163,3.9696969696969697
7838934,5,6303123244,"I watched this movie as a child, and recently bought it on VHS for our Christmas collection.  Pooh shows us what Christmas is all about--doing our best to make everyone else happy.",1386547200,,180,4.625
7838935,5,6303123244,We bought a VCR and made a list of holiday sentimental movies we'd like to be able to watch as we watched them as children. This made my list. I love Pooh.,1382745600,,155,3.875
7838936,5,6303123244,"As usual, there's not much in this Winnie the Pooh adventure for adults and the story is very, very simple. I like Disney's incarnation of this universe (far removed from AA Milne's world), but the TV series is the best way to enjoy it.

This 1991 Xmas Special finds Christopher Robin sending a letter to Santa Claus for himself and his animal friends. Hardly exciting stuff but pleasant and intermittently funny nonetheless, Hundred Acre Wood also looks lovely covered in snow.

A nice effort, and any child, or adult would find this one very pleasant!",1360022400,,553,4.810526315789474
7838937,4,6303123244,"I've never cared for Winnie the Pooh, but this Christmas special is heartwarming. Pooh and the others are frightened that their letter to Santa won't make it to the North Pole in time for the holiday, so the Silly Old Bear sets out to make things right (succeeding only in making things worse, but giving a great example of self-sacrifice).

Never quite elevated to the level of being a ""classic"" but it's very good and deserves to be viewed annually.",1354838400,,451,4.6375
7838938,5,6303123244,The delivery time was prompt :)! I absolutely LOVED this movie as a child and I jumped at the opportunity to buy it. There was slight damage to the box that holds the vhs but it's not a big deal. It came in the original wrapped plastic with coupons inside and everything! I would recommend and buy from the seller again :D,1269388800,,322,4.209677419354839
