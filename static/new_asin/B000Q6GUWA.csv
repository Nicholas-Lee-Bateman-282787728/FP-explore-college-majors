2832418,5,B000Q6GUWA,"The Backyardigans series is one of the few children's shows that can be watched over and over again without causing involuntary twitches, nervous breakdowns or constant eye rolling on the part of adults. The five characters are extremely likeable, the episodes highly imaginative, and the selection of a different genre of music for each episode is a stroke of creative genius.

Two of the episodes on this DVD qualify for special praise in the musical department, and these are ""Into the Deep"" which uses Bollywood melodies, and ""Catch That Butterfly"" which is pure operatic brilliance. ""Save the Day"" is psychedelic soul and ""Newsflash"" is inspired by Motown music.

A summary of the four episodes on this DVD is below:

""Into the Deep"" (summarized to the tune ""Octopus's Garden"")

Here you will see, under the sea
Tasha and Uniqua's garden in the shade
But don't go in, they'll cause a din
A little mermaids' garden escapade

Then undersea, came P and T
With their underwater plans for a movie
The girls freak out, and start to shout
But everything works out eventually

""Newsflash"" (summarized to the tune ""Oh What a Beautiful Morning"")

There's some bright golden corn in the cornfields
There's some bright golden corn in the cornfields
The news people sigh, no newsflashes arise
When down at the farm, two guys sensationalize

Oh what a beautiful newsflash
Oh what a beautiful sight
I've got a wonderful feeling That there will be some news tonight

""Save the Day"" (summarized to the tune ""Pop Goes the Weasel"")

Round and round the Harbor Patrol
The lady chased the whopper
The lady told them to get lost
And they couldn't stop her!

A jet ski for a sea of sharks
A chopper for a rescue
That's the way the story goes
Oh! What a whopper!

""Catch That Butterfly"" (original lyrics from ""Obsession"" by Animotion)

I will have you
Yes I will have you
I will find a way and I will have you
Like a butterfly
A wild butterfly
I will collect you and capture you

No more needs to be said about this absolutely brilliant episode about a British bug collector and two helpful stagecoach drivers. Hi-ho old chap, I've said a mouthful here.

2832419,5,B000Q6GUWA,"I'm a music teacher, and while my 2 year old loves Little Einsteins, the bad singing and inability to keep with the tempo of the music drives me crazy. The Backyardigans, on the other hand, sing very well- and in a different style for each episode. On this DVD, ""Catch that Butterfly"" is one of the best pieces on composition I've seen in a kids' DVD. The music is incredibly well written... you will enjoy watching this with your children. If you've got post-traumatic stress from watching that insipid, insulting Barney, this will help you heal!",1187222400,10,547,4.708333333333333
2832420,5,B000Q6GUWA,"We just got our copy of Into the Deep today from Amazon.com, and it's wonderful as always!

My son is watching it right now, and I LOVE the Bollywood style music of Into the Deep, which serves as a background for the mermaids Tasha and Uniqua! (I can't help but sway as I write this!)

Here are the episodes found on this DVD:

INTO THE DEEP - In this underwater Bollywood musical, Deep-Sea Explorers Tyrone and Pablo attempt to capture the garden-guarding Mermaids Uniqua and Tasha--on film, that is!

NEWS FLASH - Proud, Motown-singing Farmers Pablo and Tyrone inadvertently set up an out-of-this-world encounter in their cornfield to get their prized corn crop on the news.

SAVE THE DAY - Groove to psychedelic soul as Harbor Patrollers Uniqua, Pablo, and Tyrone repeatedly save determined Fisher-lady Tasha, who insists upon fishing in dangerous waters!

CATCH THAT BUTTERFLY - It's a Wild West chase set to comic opera when Professor Pablo hires tough Stagecoach Drivers Tyrone and Uniqua to help him catch the rare Gilded Butterfly.

Unfortunately, it seems that Austin, the purple kangaroo, is absent from all the episodes on this DVD... (Oops! I stand corrected. My son just told me that Austin appears in Newsflash.)

The Special Features are minimal: a Dora Saves the Mermaids sneak peek (it will be released in September of 2007) and a Can't Stop the Cops video.

This DVD has a runtime of 99 minutes--and is yet another fine addition to the Backyardigans DVDs!",1186012800,48,1473,4.883534136546185

She calls it ""rocket ship"" (not sure how she decided a submarine is a rocket ship) and asks for it daily.  What I like about this particular Backyardigans DVD is that the episodes are set underwater.  That makes for a change of pace and a new, interesting environment.

I really like the Backyardigans and would recommend this DVD.  I hope my toddler doesn't scratch it up and ruin it, like she has so many others.",1374364800,,491,4.47191011235955

It did not disappoint.  My two-year old loves it.  That episode is about an alien encounter in a corn field.  For adults, this is tolerable.  the only downside is that you have to use the Episode Selection feature to get to ""Newsflash,"" as it is the third episode on this DVD.

2832513,5,B000Q6GUWA,"I've always enjoyed watching the show with my 2 year old on television, but when I saw this episode I knew I had to get it on DVD.  The Bollywood music is clever, cool, and infectiously catchy.  It will make you want to shake your shoulders and twist in a lightbulb (that's my best attempt at Bollywood dancing).  Initially I loved the opening song ""Into the Deep,"" but slowly but surely, the rest of the songs found a place in my heart, especially when my daughter starting singing ""It's the Call of the Mermaid"" waiting for me to sing the response.  ""Our Garden"" is not so thinly veiled metaphor for women's virtue and no-nonsense approach to being courted (seriously, listen to it--""if you're a coral whose immoral...our garden's not for YOU!)  And finally everybody knows ""Ya' gotta be brave in a cave.""  The rest of the episodes are good, with the Harbor Rescue episode being the funniest.  This provides a solid hour of entertainment for my daughter on long car trips, and I highly recommend!",1276646400,,998,4.668571428571428

2832515,5,B000Q6GUWA,"My son loves this series, and it's been great to be able to get them on DVD, since he goes to preschool during the day. Saving up stars to earn this movie was a great incentive, and he's definitely gotten his stars worth. He loves this DVD, and has watched it for a total of probably 40 hours since we bought it a few weeks ago.

As parents, I like the series for both the lessons each episode teaches (just to be clear, they don't preach. The lessons are subtle and light, more like, play together and if you take someone's toy, give it back when you're done) and for the music. Since my son started watching these DVD's about 8 months ago, he's begun constantly singing and dancing around the house, and he utilizes ideas and imagery from the show in his own very creative play with other kids his age. I think they're an excellent show for kids 3+ if you're looking for something a bit less focused on the academic education, and more on creativity and having fun.",1252108800,2,967,4.342541436464089

It is of course some of the same shows that are on TV, so your child may have already seen them, however this doesn't seem to be a bad thing from my child's point of view.  She prefers to watch this DVD over, and over, and..

The Backyardigans are a group of five children who all live near each other, and all get together to play in their backyards.  They join up, play in their imaginations, and then have a snack at one of their houses.  If your child like singing, music, dancing, fantastic imaginative play, they will certainly enjoy this.  I would recommend it for kids over 2, probably in the 3-5yr old range, as the kids talk faster than other shows (like Dora), and the words are less enunciated, so some children may have trouble understanding what the kids say.

All in all, I find myself watching this with my daughter, and enjoying it.",1188777600,2,1009,4.387096774193548

All 4 episodes are fun, with catchy tunes that moms and dads will find themselves humming.  Each episode ends well - no funny, abrupt endings - and my son loves the fact that one of the snacks is sushi!
