The fact that we have family from Alabama makes us diehard fans for life, so buying this was a no-brainer. It's so nice to have when football is not in season. Just pop in a dvd and you got a great game. I do wish that the case it came in was different, but thats not a big deal. Love this.",1369180800,,429,4.0

4189721,5,B003SS7CPC,"I really enjoyed watching the 2009 season again, especially the games I missed in 2009. It was great watching the Tide Roll over Florida in the SEC Championship, and seeing Tebow cry at the end was priceless. The National Championship game was a bit of a let down, due to poor video quality, but with some fine tuning of color, tint, brightness, and contrast I was able to enjoy the game... All in all, if your an Alabama fan it's worth the purchase... Roll Tide",1339200000,,462,4.447058823529412

4189723,5,B003SS7CPC,"This is an awesome product. EVERY game of the 2009 season. I actually bought this for myself and I couldn't be more pleased. If you are a BAMA fan then this is a must have. You will not be disappointed. Every disc menu is broken down into quarters, so you can choose where to start the game. If you are a BAMA fan, you will enjoy this. From the first play of the Virginia Tech game to the last play of the National Championship game. It's all there and it's all worth it. ROLL TIDE!",1299196800,,482,4.08421052631579

8404718,3,B003SS7CPC,"Good collection for any Tide fan.  (2) things that could make the package better, or at least justify the original list price, was to have all the games presented in 16:9 format @ 720p Blu-ray or better.  At least present them as they were originally broadcast, but certainly commercial and advertisement free.  I dock it (1) star for 4:3 & (1) star for Standard Definition.",1416009600,,374,4.723076923076923

8404720,5,B003SS7CPC,"Unless you are a Tide afficionado you'll probably lose interest in this set after the first game because it is all about the first national championship season of the University of Alabama football team since 1992.  BUT FOR TIDE FANS, this is the holy grail.",1392595200,,258,4.733333333333333
