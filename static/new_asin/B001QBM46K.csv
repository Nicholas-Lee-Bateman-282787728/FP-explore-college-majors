Found one of the DVDs had some sticky residue on the back that left permanent marks on it, but it was still playable after a bit of cleaning. Other than that, great for the price.",1423612800,,328,4.140625
8335324,4,B001QBM46K,innocent love was so far fetched with one problem after the other. it was also filled with a lot of emotion and many touching moments as well as a dencent ending. all in all i would definatly suggest innocent love it will keep u on the edge of ur set.,1272758400,,251,4.04
8335325,4,B001QBM46K,"A lovely old fashion story about a young girl (Maki Horikita) going to the big city to escape from the ignorant country folks. In the big city she finds work and soon discovers a renewed faith and love. If only Amazon would use a 1-10 scale, I would give it a 9.
 The cast is perfect, the story is written with several hidden themes and subplots that are quite startling. As for the music, throughout this series, the music is memorable and rather haunting, I was humming the theme song all through the day. Lastly, Maki Horikita looks amazing!!",1248220800,,545,4.505050505050505
