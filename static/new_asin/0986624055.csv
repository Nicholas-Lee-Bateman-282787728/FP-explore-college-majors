8364467,5,0986624055,Saw this soon after my diagnosis and very much appreciated the light touch that covered many aspects.  This is probably not for the person who has known they had ADD for some time and has been working with therapists/doctors to help them.,1393200000,,238,4.666666666666667
8364468,5,0986624055,"This is an awesome compilation of tips presented to the audience as sticky notes for each main tip, absolutely wonderful delivery mode for someone with ADD/ADHD!  Another writer said this is ""common sense.""  I suspect that writer does not suffer with ADD/ADHD; otherwise, he/she would recognize this list of tips as a list of most troublesome character traits and what we can do about them.  It may be common sense to normal people, I agree, but ADD/ADHD brains are not normal.  We are wired differently.  What should be common sense to ADD/ADHD folks is not common practice.  This list of reminders to FOCUS on these strategies will help us ADD/ADHD folks get through our days, which are often very difficult due to these specific troubles (over and over every day).  Humor was cheesy at times, but always highly appreciated, since it's very hard for anyone to sit through a period of time watching a dry educational video, especially ADD/ADHD folks!  The authors know all about this, so they throw in plenty of silliness, which certainly keeps your attention.  Many of those humorous examples help us to identify traits in ourselves, so the humor is very useful indeed.  If you don't truly suffer from this disorder, then this DVD might be silly to you.  To those of us who do suffer and have struggled throughout most of our lifetime, we see ourselves within those examples, This is an epic list of sticky note tips that address our most troublesome deficits.  I highly recommend it to ADD/ADHD folks and their partners (so partners can gain a better understanding of our continuous daily struggles that may appear silly to unimpaired people).  Thank you so much!!!",1392595200,2,1668,4.872340425531915
